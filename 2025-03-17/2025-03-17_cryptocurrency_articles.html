<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/310231/canary-capital-files-application-for-sui-etf'>Canary Capital Files Application With SEC for SUI-Based ETF</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 20:11:31 <p>
Canary Capital filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a SUI exchange-traded fund, roughly a week after a Trump-linked decentralized finance project added the token to its reserves. “We’ve seen a significant migration of developers into the SUI ecosystem, and given the chain’s speed and efficiency, we believe it is primed for substantial future adoption,” Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg told Decrypt in an email. The filing comes roughly two weeks after Canary Capital registered a Delaware Trust entity for a SUI ETF—the first step to creating an investment vehicle tracking the altcoin's price. In its application, the firm did not name the exchange on which its SUI ETF, if approved, would trade. Canary Capital's push to launch a SUI ETF comes 10 days after the Trump-affiliated World Liberty Fi collective announced its deal with the token's issuer, Sui Network. The Nashville-based firm's bid to offer a SUI-based investment vehicle comes amid a broad push by issuers to secure approvals for a variety of digital asset-based investment products from securities regulators that have softened their stances on cryptocurrencies under newly elected President Donald Trump. Amid that increasingly crypto-friendly regulatory environment, asset managers such as VanEck, 21 Shares and Franklin Templeton have filed to offer Solana and XRP ETFs, among other digital asset-based products. Joining the fray, Canary Capital has filed to launch several ETFs based on blue-chip cryptocurrencies and altcoins over the past few months. And, more recently, the firm has made progress on its petitions to roll out funds tracking the prices of Solana and XRP. SUI was recently trading at $2.36 on Monday, up 5.1% in the past 24 hours, according to digital asset data provider CoinGecko.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Welcome to Car and Driver's Testing Hub, where we zoom in on the test numbers. Our long-term Toyota Grand Highlander with the new 362-hp Hybrid Max powertrain has been the subject of an ongoing mystery amongst our staff. One of the most common complaints leveled at the otherwise great three-row SUV is a relative lack of range on road trips. Part of the issue is that most hybrids—this one included—don’t achieve their EPA highway fuel-economy figures when traveling at real-world interstate speeds of 75-plus miles per hour. But on the real road trips our staff has undertaken, with speeds sometimes higher, and through frigid winter weather with knobbier all-weather Goodyear Assurance WeatherReady 2 tires installed, we often see mpg averages in the low 20s. But that doesn’t entirely explain why we are regularly stopping to refuel at increments less than 300 miles, and we’ve never made it more than 400 miles on a tank. Toyota’s published specifications state that it has a 17.2-gallon fuel tank, but our regular fill-ups, even when running dangerously close to zero miles on the indicated trip computer, are in the high 13- to low 14-gallon range. It’s not just us, either, as we've seen plenty of similar discussions on owners' forums. So, we finally went for broke, pushing through all of our healthy fears of getting stranded and really ran it all the way down. We pumped 16.498 gallons using our typical "three-click" method of three automatic shutoffs separated by a five count in between.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

What used to be just one race a year—the revival of the Mille Miglia in Italy—has grown into a number of very fun events all over the world, from Mille Miglia tributes in China, Japan, the UAE, and even Florida, to the Coppa delle Alpi, a re-creation of a winter race over the Alps that started in 1921. The entries included: four Porsche 356s, two Aston Martin DB4s (and a DB2), period-correct entries from Jaguar, Triumph, and Austin Healey, three Ferraris (two from the 1980s and a 348 from 1991), as well as a couple of Fiat 508 Cs. The goal on the morning of the first day was lunch in the ski resort town of Tirano (it’s a civilized event, after all), followed by a charge over the Swiss border to St. Moritz, which had only weeks before hosted the GP I.C.E. Next day was back into Italy, then over the Fuorn Pass to Austria and on to the Tyrolean town of Brixen. No doubt named after the Alfa Romeo (or vice versa). We give you the detailed route in case you want to fly to Italy and rent a car for a week, which we would definitely recommend. While 40 cars started this year, the fifth running of this commemorative race, the Coppa will accommodate twice that. “A maximum of 80 cars built up to 1990 will be accepted to the race, which will compete to win one of the 7 guarantees of acceptance to the 1000 Miglia 2026 up for grabs,” read the google-translated statement from event organizers. So you could potentially qualify for the Mille Miglia, the grandaddy of all great races. The tour enters Livigno, Italy, just a crankshaft's throw from Switzerland.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Elon Musk’s cost-cutting crusade within the U.S. government has purportedly identified computers that can print unlimited amounts of cash, the billionaire claimed in a podcast published on Monday. “I call a ‘magic money computer’ any computer which can just make money out of thin air,” Musk told Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) during the "Verdict" podcast sit-down. Musk claimed his team has found 14 computers with blank-check authority at the federal government, and suggested that they routinely send trillions of dollars to keep Washington up and running. While Musk’s fixation on government spending has been brewing for months, his latest comments on the government’s payment powers alarmed Bitcoin fans who have long viewed it as a hedge against currency degradation. Bitcoin’s portrayal as a store of value has often been linked to money-printing. Generally, Bitcoiners believe a government can create as much cash as it wants, while Bitcoin’s supply will never exceed 21 million BTC due to the way that its software was coded. The sentiment has been echoed by influential figures on Wall Street, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. In January, he said Bitcoin appeals to investors fearful of their local currency being debased through government spending, describing Bitcoin as “a currency of fear.” However, the accuracy of DOGE’s purported spending cuts has faced scrutiny. Musk has said DOGE will “act quickly to correct any mistakes,” but recent savings claims have been made with less data for identifying which contracts have purportedly been cut.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Gran Turismo Omologato, or GTO, is a name that inspires images of pure muscle car dominance on the roads of America. The original run of the Pontiac GTO was produced from 1964 to 1974, as an aggressive performance car, with big displacement engines, and unforgettable body-lines. To celebrate this amazing GTO variant, here are a few grab bag facts that make the Judge awesome. When you conjure images of The Judge, you're probably picturing one in Carousel Red - other than being striking in this color, it was originally the only color you could get one in. Although the color is called red, most would argue that the famous paint color is a deep orange. Back in the 1960s and 1970s, demand for convertible body styles was way down. Gone were the days of dreamy cruises with your sweetheart with the top down in your Tri-Five. It was pretty common to see the Hurst T-Handle shifter on many American muscle cars, and The Judge carried that along. The Judge Logo Was Inspired By Carter's Ink Typography Logo designer William Porter drew his inspiration for The Judge logo from a magazine ad showing Carter's India Ink. Porter never specified which ad kicked off his creativity, we're sure glad he saw it! For the latest news, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Dangerous Temper Tantrum: Bay Area Road Rage Shooting Caught On Camera A classic muscle car abandoned for almost three decades finally gets cleaned up by professionals. That footage, which has been blurred to hide any gore, shows two cars stop still partly in the lane of travel on a fairly busy road. But we don’t know what kind of condition that man is in now. While some people have thoughts about that, we’ve seen enough incidents like this to know there might be more to the story than just the brief footage. For example, we don’t know if the victim was actually an aggressor and had a weapon in his hand as he approached the other car. He might have had a gun and shot at the other driver. We’ve seen cases like that where the person who’s seemingly the aggressor was simply defending themselves after a violent attack not recorded by a bystander.

If a tunnel must exist, why not make it beautiful? This tunnel only exists because rule dictate that any underground train requires a matching emergency exit tunnel in case of disaster on the tracks. It could just as easily have been a boring and empty tunnel exclusively for emergency vehicles and maintenance workers, but the city decided to make it something more. The city's goal was to reduce the local population's dependency on cars, promoting an "environmentally friendly, efficient and safe transport system," according to a translation by Smithsonian Magazine. The tunnel features directional bike lanes and a path for walkers and joggers crafted from anti-fatigue blue rubber to help make walking the tunnel an even more comfortable experience. Google says that driving between Bergen and Fyllingsdal takes around 30 minutes, as you are required to take a longer route around the mountain that the tunnel cuts directly through. Even the train takes around 15 minutes from end to end, so why not hop on a bicycle and get there even faster? Living in America, it seems unfathomable that we would ever spend any amount of money to make life easier for people who don't have a car, or can't afford one. Norwegians are just built from stronger and more resilient stuff than we are, choosing to ride their bicycles in the winter or up steep hills in order to avoid the hefty cost of car ownership altogether. When government isn't actively hostile to its citizens beautiful things can happen.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The driver of a Dodge Charger was caught on camera last week in the Long Island town of Islip, New York acting shockingly nonchalant after his car went flying into a local family's backyard, leaving extensive damage to the fence and swimming pool. A wild surveillance video shared by CBS 2 New York captures the moment on March 13 that the speeding muscle car — which, based on the images, appears to either be a Charger SRT 392 Widebody or a Charger SRT Hellcat Widebody — crashes through a fence and does a full end-over-end barrel roll across the backyard, eventually landing with its front end in the pool. As stunning as the footage of the crash itself is, what happens afterward is even more bewildering. The driver of the car climbs out of the car on the passenger side and apparently begins to walk away, when he seems to realize his possessions are still in the car, so he returns and retrieves his items before slowly walking off with the help of two people who CBS 2 says were in the car behind him. According to CBS 2, property resident Emely Bisono returned home from shopping to find the Charger in the backyard of her house, where her two children and her mother were at home during the crash. (All of the home's residents were uninjured.) Bisono says the wrecked car smelled of marijuana, and says her pool needs a hazmat cleanup because of the spilled oil and gas, in addition to the physical damage caused to the yard. One more piece of high strangeness surrounds the events: while the driver walking away from the scene might seem to imply the Charger was stolen, police say that is not the case — and also stated that the car is both properly registered and fully insured.

The lines between stablecoins, lending and banking are blurring, leading to the emergence of new financial primitives, according to Tarun Gupta, CEO of payments and accounting solution Coinshift. In a video interview with Decrypt, Gupta elaborated on his thesis, explaining that this emerging financial architecture would be underpinned by yield-bearing stablecoins like Coinshift’s own csUSDL. “For the past six or seven years, stablecoins have solved one simple use case, which is money,” Gupta explained. “Today, you can basically make the movement of money faster, cheaper and better with stablecoins. Yield-bearing stablecoins, which enable holders to receive passive income while maintaining the stability of fiat-pegged tokens, build on the “architecture of promises” underpinning verifiable on-chain assets, Gupta said. “Once you combine these two layers with the power of smart contracts and blockchain, you end up having a lot of convergence between banking, lending and yield mechanisms.” Meet csUSDL: the first Liquid Lending Token (LLT) backed by a RWA. “This financial architecture is way better than what we have in TradFi,” Gupta said. “Once we have this architecture, the thesis is that every other instrument will move on-chain,” he explained, bringing trillions of dollars in value with it. Crypto-friendly jurisdictions like that of Abu Dhabi are “setting examples for other governments on how you can innovate with new technology,” Gupta said. The proposed legislation “brings lots of clarity,” while its rules on reserve management “ensures more trust” to end users like institutions, he said, adding that he is “100% confident” that institutions and neobanks will adopt stablecoins. In the future, he explained, “all fintechs will actually outcompete banks with stablecoins like USDC.” First, the launch of its SHIFT reward and governance token, which has two purposes: to reward the TVL of Coinshift’s cs-focused assets, and to regulate its ecosystem. • DeFi Integration: SHIFT rewards csUSDL holders with greater token emissions,… pic.twitter.com/mvZMOlPFUB — Coinshift (@0xCoinshift) November 21, 2024 Second, the company aims to grow csUSDL adoption by playing on its yield-bearing proposition. Already csUSDL has “15-plus DeFi integrations on day one,” Gupta said, explaining that, “At the end of the day, we’re building this underlying blueprint for making these yield-bearing instruments more liquid in DeFi, and it should be deeply integrated.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Despite being shaped like an economy car, that concept sent a claimed output of more than 500 electric horsepower to the rear wheels alone. It almost seemed too good to be true — but it turns out the production version of the R5 Turbo 3E will be even better. All that power is still going to the car's rear wheels. Renault calls the resulting product a "mini supercar," which seems like an accurate description for an electric hot hatch delivering that kind of force to just one set of drive wheels. Interestingly enough, the power comes from two in-wheel motors, which Renault says will allow for even more immediate torque delivery than a typical EV setup. The car will be available in a few specs paying tribute to classic Renault rally liveries, but buyers can also opt for their own custom look, too. Renault plans to start building the R5 Turbo 3E in 2027, giving the brand a long runway to make this particular dream a reality. When it does arrive, the French company says that the hatch will get over 250 miles of range from its 70-kWh battery. Unfortunately, an American production run doesn't seem any more likely now than it did when Renault first revealed the R5 Turbo 3E concept. Renault says that it plans to build 1980 units of the car, all aimed at "key markets including Europe, the Middle East, Japan, and Australia."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Tesla Cybertruck, seen here with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump outside the White House, has been recalled amid concerns about metal panels falling off - MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images Bentley has had to recall 11,000 Bentayga SUVs because they were a fire risk, while some Aston Martins might dump all their engine oil. We tend to hear about recalls that affect thousands or even millions of models – such as the Takata airbag concerns that hit 67 million cars – from a wide variety of manufacturers of more humble machinery, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States. But we rarely hear about the high-end brands that are affected. As cars have become more complex, that number is around five times higher than it was in the 1990s. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) figures show 1,025 affected vehicles last year compared with only 92 in 1994. The DVSA says there have already been 35 recall notices issued in 2025, although half of those are either commercial vehicles or two-wheelers. Even the world’s most expensive motors have had to be recalled. In 2022, Rolls-Royce contacted owners of its £300,000-plus Cullinan and Ghost models because of a concern that the fuel tank feed line may not be fitted correctly. And fuel spraying round a hot engine bay would ruin anyone’s day. At present, 16 variants of Rolls-Royce and 19 Lamborghinis have recall actions issued against them in the UK, while Ferrari has 55. The SF90 Stradale suffers from turbocharger oil delivery pipes that can leak “with a risk of fire”. Figures from the DVSA show that last year, BMW issued 48 recalls, Mercedes-Benz 34 and Volvo 32. BMW’s were mainly for undetected exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) leaks that may cause “thermal activity” in the intake manifold. Ferrari has 55 recall actions issued against them, citing a ‘failure due to design and/or construction’ This defect will be common to a number of products/aftermarket parts that have been sold for use in the United Kingdom.” Not very, if recent BBC research is correct that 72 per cent of recalled cars remain on the road without the rectification work being carried out. This enables it to get in touch with all the owners of affected vehicles. The DVSA stresses: “Care should be taken with the wording to avoid encouraging enthusiastic DIY keepers from taking matters into their own hands.” Rather than amateurs messing about with volatile airbag propellant, for instance, owners are encouraged to take their car to a franchised dealership where the fault can be addressed free of charge, usually by swapping parts. These are only carried out by manufacturers, normally under the guise of a service campaign. We’re often told that EVs are more reliable and cheaper to service than combustion-engined cars. In November 2024, Kia and Hyundai recalled more than 208,000 EVs because of a problem with driveshafts that could fail under load, leaving drivers powerless and thus helpless. Tesla has undergone a raft of recalls, with problems including the passenger airbag not deploying The Renault Zoe has been recalled for an internal short circuit to its battery and some older (2012-16) Nissan Leafs may suffer from loss of steering control.

Pablo Escobar’s Forgotten Passion: The Story of His Porsche 911 Carrera RSR However, beyond his empire of crime, Escobar had a little-known passion—racing cars. This Porsche, originally built for the first International Race of Champions (IROC) season, would later find its way into Escobar’s hands. But like everything in his life, its journey was far from ordinary. Before Escobar, this Porsche had already made a name for itself. Then, in a surprising turn, it was sold to Pablo Escobar in Colombia, where it would take on a new life under the drug lord’s ownership. When Escobar acquired the Porsche 911 Carrera RSR, he modified it to look like a Porsche 935 slant-nose, fitting it with Martini Racing livery. However, as his cartel empire grew in the 1980s, Escobar had less time for racing. His illegal fortune funded other drivers, including an unsuccessful attempt to place Londoño in Formula 1. The car was eventually restored to its original 1974 IROC specifications, removing Escobar’s modifications and returning it to its Sahara Beige paint and race decals. With only 15 examples of the 1974 Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0 RSR IROC ever built, this car was already a rare and valuable piece of racing history.

TON, the native token of The Open Network layer-1 blockchain, is up 29% on the week after a surge that followed a change in Telegram CEO and co-founder Pavel Durov’s bail conditions, allowing him to leave France for Dubai. “The process is ongoing, but it feels great to be home.” The messaging app founder was indicted on charges in August 2024, alleging that Telegram facilitated criminal activity on the app, and was barred from leaving France as a result. Telegram co-founders Pavel and Nikolai Durov created TON under its original name of Telegram Open Network, but abandoned plans for the chain in 2020 amid regulatory scrutiny. Development continued externally, and over the last two years, Telegram has increasingly embraced TON for capabilities like paying channel operators a share of ad revenue. Earlier this year, Telegram and TON inked an exclusive partnership that ensured Telegram mini apps (including games) with crypto connections must utilize TON moving forward. The Open Network and Telegram made significant strides with crypto user adoption last year, with mini apps helping to spur Telegram monthly active user numbers to more than 950 million as of June 2024. The NOT token of Notcoin, the first play-to-earn game on Telegram, surged to a market cap of nearly $3 billion soon after launch last summer.

Everything comes back around these days, with flared jeans on the up, Oasis reforming after a few decades away and now, great train robberies are gaining popularity once again. That's right, old fashioned train heists are back with more than $4 million worth of goods stolen from a single freight train operator in California over less than two years. Thieves in California regularly target the Burlington Northern Santa Fe rail operator, which carries freight through the state, reports Business Insider. Groups are reportedly boarding trains with saws, bolt-cutters and other tools to crack open cases of valuable goods like footwear, tools and electronics. The attacks on freight trains have hit everything from Turtle Beach Stealth Pro headsets to "Nightmare Before Christmas" toys, and that's just the goods that authorities have been able to recover. In total, authorities estimate that the BNSF railroad alone had more than $4 million worth of goods swiped from its trains since 2023. Gangs reportedly target freight trains when they are headed eastbound from California's Interstate 40, reports Outside. Once they're onboard, crews of thieves get to work locating and stealing the goods: Officers in California have unearthed stolen goods lining railroads, and placed trackers in some goods loaded onto trains to follow them once they are swiped. In many instances, the groups hitting BNSF trains had "apparent links" to Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, which is an organized-crime group formerly led by drug lord Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán. In a statement shared with Outside, the operator said it had "robust security protocols" in place on trains it operated. "We are working with federal, state, local, and tribal police departments to coordinate our approach to disrupting criminal activity and arresting offenders." Despite this hardline stance against train robberies, attacks on freight trains in America are on the rise and they aren't just hitting BNSF and its trains in California. Across the country, BI reports that cargo thefts cost rail operators more than $100 million in 2024 after railroads were hit with more than 65,000 thefts over the 12-month period. Hits on railroads in 2024 were up by around 40 percent compared with 2023, industry groups told the site.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Alfa has also confirmed plans to replace the current Giulia, though that model isn’t expected to break cover until 2026 (potentially, however, as a crossover). That said, a similar powertrain lineup would likely be expected for the sedan. No word yet on what the future holds for the Quadrifoglio models, but BMW’s hybridized M5 might be a good hint at what’s to come.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A pair of electric motors send 536 horsepower to the rear wheels and shoot the hatchback from zero to 62 mph in under 3.5 seconds. UPDATE 3/17/25: This story has been updated to incorporate new information regarding the Renault 5 3E's production and performance figures. The Renault 5 E-Tech, an electric hatchback for the European market revealed earlier this year, already sported throwback styling. While Renault has been cranking out all manner of wild concept cars in recent years—from the R17 restomod to the 5 Diamant—this rear-wheel-drive pocket rocket is going into limited production. Renault also heavily revised the bodywork for this special edition, removing the rear set of doors and installing bulging rear fenders with trim that emulates the original 5 Turbo's chunky air intake. The front fender is similarly beefy and the front end gets a more squared-off appearance with rectangular headlights, a bumper with LED fog lights, and a trio of thin vents. The Renault 5 Turbo 3E features an electric motor in each of its rear wheels, with the pair producing a combined 536 horsepower. The 70 kWh battery runs on an 800-volt architecture and Renault says it can charge from 15 to 80 percent in just 15 minutes. That's good considering owners will likely be needing lots of charging after launching from every red light and stop sign. The company is only planning to build 1980 examples of the hot hatch, each of which will be numbered.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Cardano (ADA), one of the leading blockchain platforms focused on scalability and sustainability, is trading at $0.73. However, the cryptocurrency is also grappling with tight trading ranges, which some experts suggest may lead to extended periods of sideways movement if the resistance remains unbroken. However, with other assets showing more dynamic growth potential, Cardano’s near-term excitement may seem tempered by market conditions. While Cardano prepares for its potential breakout, investor focus has shifted to an emerging powerhouse in the crypto sphere—BinoFi (BINO). Described as a innovative hybrid cryptocurrency exchange, BinoFi is making headlines for its ambitious aim to unite the best features of Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) and Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) into a seamless, user-centric experience. BinoFi’s innovative approach addresses long-standing inefficiencies in the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem. Cross-Chain Trading Without Bridges: Unlike traditional systems requiring third-party bridges for transferring assets across blockchains, BinoFi enables direct cross-chain trading, seamlessly integrating networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana. Non-Custodial MPC Wallets: The use of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology allows users to securely manage assets without compromising on control, offering added layers of security and gasless transactions. What truly sets BinoFi apart is the rampant speculation around its growth potential. This projection is based on strong adoption metrics, growing institutional interest, and the platform’s ability to solve major pain points in crypto trading. BinoFi’s upcoming beta launch has only heightened the excitement, with early users waiting to see the platform’s intuitive design and smooth integration of features. Will you back Cardano’s proven resilience or leap into BinoFi’s bold ambitions to capture the kind of exponential gains rarely seen in the market?

According to a report from Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for a new vehicle in January was $48,641 — an average increase of 4.9% per year since 2020. If you’re car shopping on a budget, the good news is that you can still find high-quality brands at a low cost. “These manufacturers still offer their lower-cost vehicles with some basic amenities to make the cars affordable, and there are still car owners that do not want or need all the extras cars come with now.” “Since they depreciate more slowly than average, owners lose less money over their years of ownership.” Musson also pointed out that Toyota engines are some of the most reliable and reach higher miles than other vehicles. Check Out: 4 SUVs That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Early 2025 Chevrolet makes a wide range of vehicles at varying price points. According to Musson, Chevy doesn’t skimp on its entry-level cars, and while entry-level vehicles don’t have all the expensive trim packages, the parts that keep it running and reliable are just as good as those in Chevrolet’s top-tier options. The most affordable cars may not have all the bells and whistles, but Pyle explained that if you take care of the car, drive it right and maintain it well, they will last a long while without major repairs. “The high-end models are nice too, but not for those on a budget,” Pyle explained.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

With a bullish design, the latest offshoot of the Renault R5 coming in 2027 boasts a top speed of 270 km/h and equally fast charging speeds. Renault has announced that the highly anticipated R5 Turbo 3E will come with 547 bhp and be limited to 1,980 examples. In terms of acceleration, the Turbo 3E can do 0-100 km/h in under 3.5 seconds and will reach a top speed of 270 km/h. Its exterior features deep front bumpers, flared wheel arches and a three-door bodystyle. There are sports bucket seats with six-point seat belt harnesses, while the seats and dashboard are finished off in Alcantara. Fabrice Cambolive, chief executive of Renault brand, said: “By creating the new category of electric ‘mini-supercars’ with the Renault 5 Turbo 3E, the Renault brand once again demonstrates the passion and spirit of boldness and innovation that has always driven it. This exuberant, over-excited model promises the best performance and sensations in just four metres of length, which is unprecedented in the market.” He added: “With this car, Renault continues to make electric vehicles ever more desirable, further extending its ability to provide solutions for every need and every desire.” Prices are yet to be revealed, but the car will go on sale in 2027 with reservations opening in the next few weeks. The price is expected to be significantly higher than the €24,900 or €38,700 that Renault has charged for previous R5 spin-offs.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

General Motors has issued a recall notice for more than 90,000 examples of the Chevrolet Camaro and Cadillac's CT4, CT5 and CT6 sedans to fix a transmission fault that could potentially cause the front wheels of the affected vehicles to lock up Obviously, this potential leads to an increased risk of crashing, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says. However, the fix is an essential one, GM explained in its recall filings. GM says this is because the most likely wheel lock-up condition would be during a downshift from eighth gear. GM first took action around this issue in September 2024 after an internal brand quality manager submitted a report to GM's Speak Up for Safety program. The report claimed that a driver of a 2021 Cadillac CT5 had both front tires lock up while driving before the vehicle went into neutral. This specific model had to have its engine and front differential replaced. However, after the internal safety report, GM opened an investigation on November 21, 2024, and found 115 field reports by December. In any event, this isolated issue could have been a much bigger headache for GM, especially if an internal safety report hadn't been filed. And as always... this recall also serves as a reminder to fit your car with a manual transmission if it's an option.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Every day since May 22, 2022 we have lived in fear of the awesome power wielded by the despicable Max Verstappen regime, until today. On a wet Sunday in Australia, after 1029 days living in the shadow of a Max Verstappen WDC leader, the despotic dictator was defeated in battle by the young Briton Lando Norris astride his trusty McLaren steed. No driver has ever spent as long leading the championship, and I hope that his reign of terror has come to its permanent end. Across those 1,029 days Verstappen has won 39 Grands Prix, well over half the number that were held. It goes without saying that Max is a talented driver, and when he has the fastest car on the grid he can turn it into a championship. McLaren saw a late-season improvement well above and beyond what Red Bull had and took the constructors' championship as a result, and it seems the papaya team is still on its championship form.

With wet and drying and re-wetting conditions, it was a disastrously messy event that saw several drivers smash their cars into the wall and several strategies thrown out the window with a guess on the unpredictable weather.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/teslas-alleged-self-driving-tech-163344350.html'>Tesla's Alleged Self-Driving Tech Defeated By YouTuber With Cartoon-Style Foam Wall</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 16:33:44 <p>
The weird nerd you know who still wrongly believes Elon Musk personally invented the front trunk may disagree, but as ole Ben Shapiro loves to say, facts don't care about your feelings. That's been known for a while, but in case you still need a demonstration of LIDAR's superiority, former NASA engineer and current YouTuber Mark Rober recently put both systems to the test. While even a base Toyota Corolla offers adaptive cruise control and more advanced driver assistance than still comes standard on some luxury cars, passenger vehicles equipped with LIDAR are much less common. As for the Tesla, Rober used a Model Y that he personally owns. He then evaluated how well each vehicle handled tests meant to simulate a child standing in the road, a child running into the road, heavy fog, heavy rain, blinding lights and, in the ultimate test, a giant foam wall showing an image of the road behind it, Wile. Read more: Tesla Recalls Almost Every Car It's Sold In The US There's simply no way cameras are going to outperform LIDAR, period. That doesn't mean the Tesla's cameras were useless, though. After passing the blinding light test, you could be forgiven for thinking there was a chance, but nope: It just plowed right through. It probably isn't something you'll ever encounter in real life, but it still does a great job of highlighting just how flawed Tesla's camera-only approach is. As you can imagine, those convinced Tesla is on the verge of solving autonomy and becoming a $5 trillion company by selling a humanoid robot to every human on Earth — all very real things Musk has actually promised on earnings calls with investors — are not happy with a famous YouTuber broadcasting even more evidence to the world that a camera-only system is inferior. They're saying it was unfair to use Autopilot instead of Full Self-Driving, as if more software could make up for the inherent limitations of a camera system. They're saying he must have faked the results and not used Autopilot at all. And even if I could, it's not like the Tesla zealots would accept it from someone who's been on the record for years saying Autopilot is bad — a position I still hold to this day. However, Rober isn't some part-time YouTuber with a few thousand subscribers, a day job selling tires and no real assets of any kind. He has more than 65 million subscribers and likely makes substantial money from his channel. He has assets that can be used to satisfy a legal judgment. If Tesla believes this video was deceptively edited to defame the automaker, it has every right to, and absolutely should, sue Mark Rober. If Tesla sues and wins, then we'll have our proof. Until then, the question stands: If this video really is deceptive and inaccurate, why hasn't Tesla sued yet?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://es.cryptobriefing.com/pronostico-del-precio-de-ether-a-fin-de-ano/'>Standard Chartered reduce pronóstico de Ether a $4K</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cryptobriefing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 16:21:37 <p>
Conclusiones Clave Standard Chartered redujo su objetivo de fin de año para Ether a $4,000 debido a un declive estructural. Además, la reciente actualización de Ethereum, denominada Dencun, no ayuda a la red a mantener su dominio en el mercado. Standard Chartered declaró que Ethereum sigue liderando en muchas métricas clave de blockchain, pero su dominio ha disminuido con el tiempo. Las blockchains de segunda capa, originalmente diseñadas para ayudar a Ethereum mejorando la escalabilidad y reduciendo las tarifas de transacción, han desplazado valor económico fuera de Ethereum, señaló el informe. «Ether está en una encrucijada,» dijo el informe, señalando que aunque «todavía domina en varias métricas,» este dominio ha estado declinando. Standard Chartered pronostica que la relación ETH/BTC caerá a 0.015 para finales de 2027, lo que marcaría su nivel más bajo desde 2017. Aunque el banco espera que el precio de Ether se recupere de los niveles actuales debido a un repunte más amplio liderado por Bitcoin que elevará todos los activos digitales, mantiene que Ether seguirá rindiendo por debajo. El año pasado, Standard Chartered proyectó que Ethereum alcanzaría los $8,000 para finales del año en curso y $14,000 para finales de 2025. También consideraron la actualización de Dencun como otro factor positivo que contribuye al potencial crecimiento del precio de Ethereum. A principios de este año, Standard Chartered predijo que Ethereum podría alcanzar los $10,000 para finales de 2025 como resultado de un ambiente favorable para el crecimiento cripto bajo la nueva administración. Ethereum se cotizaba alrededor de $1,900 en el momento de la prensa, subiendo ligeramente en las últimas 24 horas, según TradingView. El activo digital ha bajado alrededor del 42% en lo que va de año y sigue estando un 60% por debajo de su máximo histórico. Esta actualización tiene como objetivo mejorar el rendimiento de la red, mejorar la participación de los validadores e introducir varias características clave como EIP-7702 y EIP-7251.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A historic bleed for digital asset investment products stretched into its fifth week, as products tracked by CoinShares lost $1.7 billion, the crypto investment firm said on Monday. Exchange-traded products holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are now facing their worst stretch of outflows on record, totaling $6.4 billion since Feb. 7, CoinShares said in a report. As President Donald Trump's tariffs continued driving trade tensions and inflation concerns, Bitcoin funds were hit particularly hard, per CoinShares’ report. Investors yanked $978 million from Bitcoin funds last week as the asset’s price fell to a four-month low of $77,000. Bitcoin’s price has since reclaimed $83,000, but “a lot of resistance” from last week’s low suggests more pain lies ahead, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt. On Friday, the University of Michigan’s latest consumer survey showed sentiment plunging to its lowest level since November 2022 amid Trump’s erratic tariff approach. Butterfill suggested that deteriorating consumer sentiment in the U.S. may prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates soon, buoying crypto prices as borrowing becomes cheaper. The U.S. central bank will hold its latest policy meeting this week. While officials are widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, the Fed will release a series of updated projections touching on key metrics like employment and inflation. Last week’s inflation figures came in soft, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

As such, SC has revised its 2025 price target from $10,000 to $4,000. This means that even if Ethereum goes up in absolute terms, it will increasingly lag Bitcoin by market cap, he wrote in a new market note shared with Decrypt. Aside from Base, other Ethereum Layer-2s include Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync Era, Polygon zkEVM. The analyst estimated that Base has removed $50 billion from ETH’s market cap. Kendrick argues this is because when users make transactions on these L2s instead of the original Ethereum network, fees go to organizations other than the Ethereum Foundation (such as Coinbase), reducing the fees it receives. The analyst did posit that a proactive "change of commercial direction from the Ethereum Foundation – such as taxing Layer-2s" could mitigate these issues and improve its market share, but said they think this is "unlikely." BASE may have proved a very profitable project for Coinbase. Kendrick pointed out some other possible avenues whereby ETH could keep its market dominance; for example, if tokenized real-world assets, which commonly use Ethereum, were to suddenly surge in popularity. The analyst feels ETH’s security credentials will maintain its popularity in this area but stated, "this is no longer a sound basis for our medium-term views." Its introduction could bring significant improvements in ETH staking, dramatically raising current limits, as well as the ability to pay gas fees in cryptocurrencies other than ETH. Developers plan to launch a final testnet, Hoodi, later this month. ETH is up 1.3% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Michael Saylor’s Strategy has resumed its Bitcoin buying. After a brief pause, the business intelligence firm has snapped up another $10.7 million worth of BTC, adding 130 coins to its already massive stash, bringing its total holdings to nearly half a million. With this latest buy, Strategy's total Bitcoin holdings have now reached 499,226 BTC, valued at around $41.4 billion, or approximately 2.4% of the total Bitcoin supply, per the latest U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) Commission filing. The acquisition was funded using proceeds from the “STRK ATM,” a new program Strategy launched to raise up to $21 billion in fresh capital. An At-The-Market (ATM) offering allows a company to sell shares directly into the secondary trading market at prevailing market prices over time, rather than through a traditional public offering. The Bitcoin giant's long-term plan involves raising $42 billion over the next three years to expand its holdings significantly as part of its “strategy” to acquire Bitcoin as a key asset despite market fluctuations. Following the announcement, Bitcoin’s price jumped slightly, but has since fallen by 0.3%, trading at $82, 921.51, CoinGecko data shows. While the latest buy is among its smallest, the company had its largest acquisition of 2025 on Feb. 24, purchasing 20,365 BTC for nearly $2 billion. Starting in early November, it had purchased Bitcoin on a near-weekly basis. Alongside its corporate acquisitions, Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, has always advocated for Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for the U.S. government.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin and Ethereum traded at key levels amid $1.7 billion in crypto investment outflows for last week. BTC traded just above $83k while ETH hovered near $1,900 as of writing. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices continue to struggle amid a broader market downturn. The top two digital assets by market cap were up 1.1% and 1.5% respectively. Also trending has been the massive liquidations to hit cryptocurrencies since BTC flipped negative with price plummeting below $100k and then $90k. Per latest report on performance of digital asset investment products, bearish pressure remains as outflows mount. Overall, it extended the negative flows to a five-week total of $6.4 billion. Despite the gloom, year-to-date inflows remain in positive territory at $912 million. What analysts are however looking at is the sustained price correction. Bitcoin’s weekly outflows reached $978 million, pushing its five-week total to a staggering exit of $5.4 billion. Last week, a total of $3.6 million in short BTC positions left exchange-traded funds and other digital asset products. In a comment on what may be next for BTC and other assets, analysts at QCP Capital noted: The trend has also been downward for Ethereum – both in terms of market price and investment products AUM.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Four teenagers have been charged after an OnlyFans streamer was ordered to hand over her crypto at gunpoint. Kaitlyn Siragusa, a popular influencer also known as Amouranth, was targeted at her home in Texas earlier this month. She escorted them to another part of her Houston property where her husband fired a gun, and the robbers fled the scene. Demarcus Morris Jr., who is 17 years old, has been charged with aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Dylan Nesho Campbell, 18, and Bryan Anthony Salazar Guerrero, 19, face the same charges. Harris County District Clerk's Office says an unidentified 16-year-old is also a suspect in the case. Back in November, Siragusa had posted a picture of her posing in lingerie on X, along with the caption: "Help! A screenshot of her Coinbase account showed she had 211 BTC in her wallet—worth about $17.6 million at current market rates. In an interview with FOX 26 Houston, Siragusa revealed that she was on the phone to her husband, who was in a separate part of their property, throughout the ordeal. These three guys came into my room, turned all the lights on and had the gun pointed at me," she said. Siragusa recently revealed that the men only managed to take her MacBook, which was later traced to the same hospital where she had been treated for her injuries.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://bitcoinmagazine.com/featured/bitcoin-covenants-what-are-they-and-what-do-they-do'>Bitcoin Covenants: What Are They And What Do They Do?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> bitcoinmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 14:36:24 <p>
Covenant : a usually formal, solemn, and binding agreement. They’re the best thing since sliced bread. Everyone has a completely different attitude towards them. To make matters worse, covenant is frankly a very vague term in its description of mature and concrete proposals to the protocol that would be classified as covenants. Some of them create entirely new design spaces for what it is possible to build on top of Bitcoin, while others strictly speaking don’t add any new functionality at all, they simply optimize things that are already currently possible with a large degree of complexity and overhead. Let’s create a new definition specific to Bitcoin. Covenant : any script that guarantees some, or all, of the outputs created by a transaction spending an input with a covenant script will have to fit certain specified criteria for the spending transaction to be consensus valid. That last part is the core of what has made covenant such a contentious word. Many people have large reservations about adding a new way to “lock” bitcoins that can self-propagate and ensure future coins are restricted in a similar fashion. Many people have concerns about this being used to damage fungibility or institute censorship regimes. I feel it necessary to point out that both of these things can be accomplished right now, with no covenant script capability, simply by using multisig. From there they can simply refuse to sign transactions sending to addresses where they do not hold a required key, and establish whatever blacklist or whitelist scheme they desired opaquely and entirely off-chain. That said, it is still important for Bitcoin users to have a grasp and understanding of the difference of power and flexibility between all the different covenant proposals that currently exist. Introspection is the ability to inspect different parts of the transaction that is being evaluated while trying to spend a specific coin. The more granular you can get with introspection concerning which particular parts of a transaction you can examine, the more powerful it becomes. Forward data carrying is related to introspection, and in many ways a consequence of it, that allows you to ensure some piece of information is carried forward and included in each new covenant script so that it can be used in the next evaluation of the covenant script. This is accomplished by using introspection to restrict certain parts of the transaction so tightly that they must include the exact desired data or they are invalid. This is just the first introduction to a series of articles to come over the next few weeks looking at all the major covenant proposals that are in a mature state, have received recent interest, or are conceptually critically important enough that developers agree on their usefulness but not yet a concrete design.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

PancakeSwap, a decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, has the largest trading volume over the past 24 hours—beating even Ethereum-based competitor Uniswap. And according to CoinGecko, all that volume has sent the price of its CAKE token surging as much as 40% in the past day. This comes after Binance delisted Tether from its centralized exchange, prompting an increase in Tether volume on PancakeSwap, and an unrelated surge of interest in meme coins on Binance Smart Chain. Now, PancakeSwap has processed more than $346 million worth of trading volume for USDT over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. That amounts to roughly 54% of trading volume on the exchange. On top of this, it appears that Binance Smart Chain meme coins are seeing a resurgence. Back in 2021, the network was one of the cultural hubs for meme coins due to its low gas fees. At one point, the SafeMoon meme coin skyrocketed to a market cap of $6 billion. However, the trenches have been more focused on Solana for speculative meme coin trading—largely due to the creation of launchpad Pump.fun. According to DappBay, most Binance Smart Chain meme coins have found themselves in the green over the past 24 hours. This has likely been helped along by the launch of SpringBoard, a token launchpad akin to Pump.fun, on Binance Smart Chain at the end of last year. With this, Mubarak accounts for over 12% of daily trading volume on PancakeSwap.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The hacker managed to steal 8.65 million WEMIX coins Kim Seok-hwan, Wemix Foundation’s CEO, said there was “no attempt” to conceal a $6.2 million hack on it following an announcement four days later. In a press conference on Monday, Kim denied any intention to conceal the exploit. On February 28, over 8.65 million WEMIX coins were withdrawn due to a malicious attack on the platform’s Play Bridge Vault. However, the South Korean platform only alerted its investors when an announcement was posted on its homepage on March 4. According to Kim, most of the assets had already been sold and the market impact had already happened, adding that there was no guarantee of “additional risk.” Explaining what happened, Kim said an unidentified attacker stole the service monitoring authentication key for its non-fungible token (NFT) platform Nile. Last month, Bybit was hacked after those responsible drained $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum from a single wallet. Regarding the Wemix Foundation, Kim said on March 13 that they will buy back 10 billion Korean won (around $7 million) worth of Wemix tokens.

Cryptocurrency exchange OKX announced today that it has temporarily halted its decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator following a series of targeted media attacks and a detected attempt by the Lazarus Group to exploit its platform. Following the $1.5 billion Bybit hack, OKX Web3 reportedly drew regulatory attention over concerns about its platform being used for money laundering. Based on the general tactics employed by Lazarus, this could involve using OKX’s platforms to launder stolen funds, since DeFi platforms often allow users to conduct transactions without strict Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. “Our role is to provide access to liquidity across multiple protocols, offering users the most efficient peer-to-peer trading experience possible,” the firm clarified. OKX has also launched a “hacker address detection system” for its DEX aggregator and a system to track and block hacker addresses across its centralized exchange (CEX) platform in real-time. The firm has pledged to continue innovating and advocating for a “more transparent and responsible digital asset space,” promising further updates in the near future. Nevertheless, OKX has been under scrutiny for allegations that its Web3 services were used to launder stolen funds from the Bybit hack. Bloomberg reported last week that European Union regulators were investigating OKX’s Web3 service amid concerns that hackers, then identified as Lazarus Group, used the platform to launder $100 million in stolen crypto assets from Bybit. Lazarus Group allegedly used the service to transfer stolen funds across various exchanges and blockchains. Responding to Bloomberg’s reporting of the investigation, Haider Rafique, OKX’s Chief Marketing Officer, said in an X statement that the claims were misleading. Rafique also noted that OKX froze funds associated with the Bybit hack that entered its CEX and developed new security measures to detect and block malicious addresses. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou, who has acted actively to address the exchange hack and provide transparent updates, said that there was a misunderstanding regarding the source of information in a recent Bloomberg article.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Trump administration’s pro-crypto agenda risks "sowing the seeds" of a financial crisis, according to a top European Central Bank official. In an interview with French weekly La Tribune Dimanchei, François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France and member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council, argued that the U.S. "risks sinning through negligence." His admonitions echo a previous warning from sixteen Nobel Economists who claimed in June last year that Trump's "fiscally irresponsible budgets" could "reignite" inflation and broader economic instability. Villeroy de Galhau argued that Trump pursues a “false vision" in which the global economy functions as a "zero-sum game," calling on Europe to "strengthen" its negotiating position. Earlier this year, the ECB announced a two-phase digital payments infrastructure initiative, under which it plans to explore “a more integrated, long-term solution” for settlements of central bank money-denominated transactions on a blockchain. In its first couple of months, the Trump administration has established a crypto council, a Presidential Working Group on digital assets, worked to pass crucial crypto bills, signed an executive order to establish a Bitcoin Reserve, hosted the inaugural crypto summit at the White House, and promised to end Biden-era crypto banking rules, among other moves that have boosted the profile of the crypto industry. Trump’s pro-crypto push has failed to shore up the crypto market, though, with both Bitcoin and U.S. equities rattled by market volatility sparked by his economic agenda. Following Trump's threat to impose 200% tariffs on European spirits on Thursday last week, the S&P 500 plummeted more than 10% from its February high, reporting from Reuters indicates. Bitcoin, at the time, tumbled to $81,600—down 25% from a January peak of $109,000. On the same day, crypto markets saw liquidations of over $1 billion, with analysts pointing to risk aversion across global markets and escalating U.S. tariff disputes as key drivers.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bitcoin has come a long way since trading at just $5.34 on Saint Patrick’s Day in 2012. With institutional adoption surging and supply remaining fixed, Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory appears stronger than ever. Bitcoin’s price movements in the early years was anything but predictable. Despite its volatility, Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains upward, driven by increasing demand and fixed supply. Unlike fiat currencies, which governments can print indefinitely, Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins. As more individuals, institutions, and even governments adopt Bitcoin, scarcity drives prices higher. Several major factors are contributing to Bitcoin’s growing adoption in the last year: The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – United States Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich both introduced legislation to green light the U.S. to purchase 1,000,000 BTC for their strategic reserves, further solidifying its legitimacy and causing other countries potential FOMO in. Corporate Adoption – Companies like Strategy, Metaplanet, and Rumble continue adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, treating it as a strategic reserve asset.

RAAC, a decentralized Real World Asset (RWA) lending and borrowing ecosystem, is announcing the launch of its testnet today in the face of strong institutional demand. However, as for DeFi, this value is currently derived mostly from crypto speculation. We need projects like RAAC to go beyond our crypto bubble, realize the true potential of programmable, decentralized money, and eventually have the global financial system naturally re-architected." Initially, RAAC will develop protocols integrating gold-backed and real estate-backed tokens from asset owners through Instruxi – a leading institutional tokenization provider that serves both the digital and traditional asset space. These asset owners include Pretio DeFi Solutions, which, with its partners, has secured a contract with the North Terrace Mining Project in British Columbia to acquire 1 million troy ounces of proven gold reserves for tokenization. Over a 10 to 15-year production cycle, once the gold is extracted, refined, and securely stored, the tokenized asset’s total estimated value could reach up to $3 billion, depending on market conditions and future gold prices.

Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem shows weakness with only $360 million TVL Cardano has experienced a roller coaster of price action in recent weeks. This movement has created uncertainty among traders about the next market direction. The bear pennant formed after ADA’s sharp drop from $1.15 to $0.713. This breakdown has sent ADA to $0.714, and technical projections suggest a move toward $0.464 by April. $ADA Price If this triangle breaks to the upside, we could see a move towards $0.90 🚀 pic.twitter.com/I0fk1Msqsw — Trader Edge (@Pro_Trader_Edge) March 15, 2025 This reading remains in bearish territory and suggests further weakness ahead. On-chain data from Messari tracks the supply of ADA held in whale addresses. This marks a net outflow of approximately 2 million ADA in just one week. Whales may be anticipating further price drops or moving capital to other investments. This trend could indicate further downside for ADA unless new buying pressure emerges. Cardano also faces fundamental challenges that align with this bearish outlook. Despite its research-driven approach and staking ecosystem, the network struggles to maintain momentum. As of March 17, 2025, Cardano ranked outside the top 10 blockchains by total value locked (TVL). The gap highlights Cardano’s challenges in attracting DeFi activity. Despite the 2021 Alonzo hard fork introducing smart contract functionality, Cardano’s growth has been slower than expected. Daily transactions average 66,000 in early March, compared to Ethereum’s 1.1 million. The Federal Reserve’s pause on rate cuts and ongoing trade tensions have hurt altcoins more than Bitcoin. For traders looking at risk-to-reward ratios, the $0.65-$0.68 region may offer a buying opportunity. This zone coincides with the range low and has shown support in recent price action. BTC saw a 2.38% decline in seven hours, which dragged ADA down by 4.68%.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Rexas Finance (RXS) marks the future of asset management, not only another cryptocurrency. The concept presents a decentralized environment where users may easily tokenize and trade actual assets, generating countless investment prospects. Early presale participants have already witnessed over 500% gains, reinforcing RXS as a fierce competitor in the crypto space. The token’s capacity to draw high degrees of investment reveals great market confidence. Investors who participate in the presale with a minimum of $100 complete tasks and refer others to receive additional entries. Rexas Finance has real use cases that motivate its acceptance, unlike Shiba Inu, which depends on speculative trading and market hype. Social media trends, celebrity sponsorships, and speculative trading have mostly driven Shiba Inu’s success. While this has favored meme coins in past market cycles, they frequently find it difficult to sustain long-term value without robust foundations. Through initiatives like Shibarium, SHIB’s ecosystem has tried to add more value, but its price is still somewhat erratic, mostly based on market attitude. This guarantees long-term price appreciation and steady demand, particularly as the larger market embraces tokenized assets. Experts estimate that once RXS is listed on major exchanges, it may see a huge surge. Its presale momentum and strong investor support help it position itself to top SHIB’s market cap in the next bull run. If RXS tracks its expected course, early investors could experience gains substantially greater than Shiba Inu holders. With its excellent foundations, strategic presale expansion, and special position in the RWA sector, Rexas Finance (RXS) is becoming a major rival to Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the next bull market. Shiba Inu’s established community and past price swings help it remain a powerful competitor in the market. However, its dependence on hype and speculation makes it sensitive to market declines. Investors seeking tokens with exponential potential want the crypto market to be ready for its next significant bull run.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://blockonomi.com/too-volatile-bank-of-korea-rejects-bitcoin-as-foreign-reserve-asset/'>“Too Volatile” Bank of Korea Rejects Bitcoin as Foreign Reserve Asset</a></h2><b>Source:</b> blockonomi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 10:02:41 <p>
Bitcoin does not meet IMF criteria for foreign exchange reserves (liquidity, market stability, investment-grade credit rating) Discussions about national crypto reserves have increased globally after the US established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The bank pointed to Bitcoin’s price instability as a key factor in its decision. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin prices have fluctuated between $98,000 and $76,000 before settling around $83,000, representing a 15% decline since February 16. Central bankers warned that “transaction costs to cash out Bitcoins could rise drastically” if the cryptocurrency market experiences instability. This concern about liquidity during market downturns appears to be a major factor in their cautious stance. Officials also noted that Bitcoin fails to meet the International Monetary Fund’s requirements for foreign exchange reserves. These criteria mandate that reserve assets maintain liquidity, market stability, and hold a credit rating of investment grade or higher. The Bank of Korea emphasized that foreign exchange reserves must be immediately usable when needed. Bitcoin’s volatility and uncertain liquidity during market stress make it unsuitable for this purpose in their assessment. The rejection comes despite increasing calls from some quarters to consider Bitcoin’s potential role in national financial systems. Global interest in national crypto reserves has grown following the US government’s decision to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Brazil and the Czech Republic have expressed interest in exploring Bitcoin as a potential reserve asset. The country’s Financial Services Commission has been working to lift restrictions on institutional crypto trading. In November, FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan acknowledged calls for a national Bitcoin reserve but dismissed the idea as premature.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Debiex ordered to pay $2.5 million after CFTC lawsuit over “pig butchering” romance scam Scammers posed as successful female traders, targeting 5 victims who deposited around $2.3 million Zhāng Chéng Yáng identified as a “money mule” with an OKX wallet containing 63 ETH and USDT The CFTC accused Debiex of operating a “pig butchering” scam that targeted investors through romantic deception. On March 13, Arizona federal court Judge Douglas Rayes granted the CFTC’s motion for summary judgment against Debiex. The court also imposed a civil penalty of nearly $221,500. According to court documents, the platform marketed itself as a “Blockchain Network Decentralized perpetual contract trading platform” where users could engage in futures trading and mining transactions. In reality, the operation was allegedly a sophisticated romance scam targeting unsuspecting investors. The CFTC claimed that Debiex staff posed as female traders to build trust with potential victims. These fake personas engaged in continuous conversations with targets and sent personal photos. They presented themselves as highly successful cryptocurrency investors to gain credibility. The court documents detailed how victims were provided with fabricated account balances after depositing funds. “All of this information was most likely false,” the CFTC stated in its complaint. The agency found that customer deposits were funneled through multiple digital wallets to hide their final destination. He was accused of acting as a “money mule” by handling transactions through cryptocurrency wallets used to receive and launder victims’ funds. On March 12, Judge Rayes granted the CFTC’s request for a default judgment against Zhāng. The wallet contained nearly 63 Ether (ETH) valued at approximately $119,500 and $5.70 worth of Tether (USDT). These scams typically begin on social media platforms where fraudsters initiate romantic relationships with targets. These platforms are actually fraudulent operations designed to steal funds. The CFTC continues to actively pursue cases involving cryptocurrency fraud.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Judge Christopher Nugee ruled there was “no real prospect of success” for his case James Howells, the UK man who lost a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin in a Welsh landfill, has had his appeal rejected by the UK Court of Appeal. This latest setback comes after years of trying to gain permission to search the landfill site where he believes his valuable hard drive remains buried. The hard drive was accidentally thrown away by Howells’ ex-partner in 2013. Lord Justice Christopher Nugee denied Howells’ appeal in court documents released on March 14. His previous case was rejected by the High Court in January. Judge Andrew Keyser had previously dismissed the case, saying there was “no realistic prospect” of Howells succeeding at a full trial. This effectively ends Howells’ options within the UK legal system. However, a ruling in Howells’ favor would call on UK courts to reconsider whether legislation was interpreted compatibly with ECHR provisions. In February, reports emerged that Howells had assembled a group of investors willing to buy the landfill from Newport City Council. Few predicted Bitcoin would reach such high values when Howells lost his hard drive in 2013. Newport City Council has maintained that searching the landfill would impact what they consider a critical piece of local infrastructure. This stance has remained unchanged despite Howells’ continued legal efforts. Howells, an IT worker and early Bitcoin adopter, told City AM that his legal bid was about “proving a point.” He continues to believe his hard drive can be recovered from the landfill site.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Scammers provide pre-generated recovery phrases that give them control of any transferred funds Emails falsely cite a dismissed SEC lawsuit as reason for required wallet changes Both Coinbase and Gemini exchanges have been impersonated in similar scams Coinbase has warned users they will never send recovery phrases to customers Cryptocurrency users are facing a new wave of phishing attacks impersonating major exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini. These messages falsely claim that due to a court mandate stemming from a class-action lawsuit, users must move their assets to self-managed wallets before April 1. Is anyone else getting the fake @coinbase emails and texts? This creates a false sense of urgency to trick recipients into taking immediate action. These emails use the same tactics, claiming users need to set up new wallets because of a recent court decision. The SEC also ended its legal action against Gemini on February 26. This latest attack comes during a period of increased phishing activity in the cryptocurrency space. Users who fall victim to these scams typically lose all their transferred funds immediately. The phishing emails create a false sense of legitimacy by appearing to come from trusted exchanges. They often include official logos, similar formatting, and language that mimics real communications from these companies. Security experts advise crypto users to always verify communications directly through official exchange websites or apps. Users should never use recovery phrases provided by anyone else, even if the source appears to be legitimate. This phishing campaign follows reports of other sophisticated scams targeting the crypto industry. At least three crypto founders recently reported foiling attempts from alleged North Korean hackers who used fake Zoom calls to try to steal sensitive data. The California financial regulator has also issued warnings about seven new types of crypto and AI scams currently targeting consumers. Crypto exchanges recommend enabling two-factor authentication and using hardware wallets for added security. Community vigilance has played an important role in alerting others to the ongoing phishing campaign. No court has mandated that users of these exchanges must move to self-custodial wallets.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

XRP wallets reached an all-time high of 6.87 million, suggesting growing user interest SEC may be considering classifying XRP as a commodity, similar to Ethereum, potentially enhancing ETF approval chances Recent 8% price drop came after SEC paused approval process for altcoin ETFs, but derivatives market metrics indicate bullish sentiment may still be in play The token recently ended a four-day winning streak with an 8% drop, trading at approximately $2.30 as of March 16, 2025. This increase suggests more people are engaging with the token, which could indicate rising interest and potential upward momentum. This large transfer, flagged by Whale Alert, has raised questions about Ripple’s strategic preparations. The ongoing SEC lawsuit continues to be a key factor in XRP’s price trajectory. The SEC is reportedly using Ethereum’s current regulatory treatment as a benchmark in its deliberations. Despite the price dip, derivatives market metrics indicate bullish sentiment may still be present. According to Coinglass data, XRP’s trading volume has increased by 12.11%, reaching $6.05 billion. XRP’s open interest has dropped by 6.70% to $3.14 billion, indicating that leveraged positions are unwinding. Some analysts view this as a potential sign that the current correction might be nearing its end. Technical indicators show the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 47.49, placing it in neutral territory. A sustained RSI climb above 50 would support the case for continued upward movement. The upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on February 19 will likely influence broader market sentiment. Any indication of dovish monetary policy could increase risk appetite, potentially benefiting XRP and other digital assets. If XRP maintains support near $2.30, bulls could regain control, potentially driving prices toward $2.50 in the short term and $2.80 beyond that. Breaking above these levels could open the path to higher targets, while falling below support at $2.30 might trigger further selling pressure.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This is not the first time Villeroy de Galhau has spoken out against Trump’s economic approaches. The French central banker has been openly critical of Trump’s broader economic policies as well.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped major cases against crypto exchanges, including Coinbase. Trump has also created what his administration calls a “crypto strategic reserve.” This plan involves the United States stockpiling popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Villeroy de Galhau’s comments come at a time of growing tension between European financial authorities and the Trump administration over various economic policies.

Toncoin (TON) saw a 67% increase in open interest and 17-20% price surge following news of Telegram founder Pavel Durov’s temporary departure from France The case highlights ongoing tensions between regulators and privacy-focused platforms like Telegram Toncoin (TON) prices jumped nearly 20% following reports that Telegram founder Pavel Durov received permission to temporarily leave France. Durov had been under strict travel restrictions since his arrest in August 2024. He was detained at Le Bourget Airport near Paris on charges related to allegations that Telegram enabled organized crime activities. Sources told AFP (Agence France-Presse) that he left France on March 16. The modified supervision conditions permit him to stay outside France for “several weeks.” Telegram has not issued any official statement regarding his travel or the ongoing legal case. Data from CoinGlass shows TON’s open interest jumped 67% over 24 hours to reach $169 million. A major spike occurred on March 13, just before the announcement of Durov’s travel permission. According to Trader Edge on X, Ton could be looking at a push towards $4.60 next. This project operates within the TON ecosystem and called Durov’s travel approval a “victory for freedom.” This isn’t the first time TON prices reacted to Durov’s legal situation. When Durov was arrested in August 2024, TON’s open interest spiked 32% over 24 hours. Crypto Billion posted on X (formerly Twitter) that Toncoin is “showing signs of a potential long-term accumulation phase as it stabilizes near key support levels.” The price dropped over 35% after his August arrest, falling from $6.88 to $4.44 by September. The token has struggled to maintain momentum despite occasional price surges. Governments have pressured Telegram and similar services to enhance content moderation.

Only one fund bucked the trend: Grayscale’s BTC managed to attract $5.5 million in new investments. Data from SoSoValue shows that cumulative net inflows now stand at $35.20 billion. March has been even worse, with only one day of positive inflows so far. The total value of these funds has dropped by nearly 25% from their peak in late January. Assets under management (AUM) for Bitcoin ETFs have seen a small recovery recently. This is mainly due to a 10% increase in Bitcoin’s price. However, this price boost hasn’t been enough to stop the ongoing outflows. This marked the seventh day in a row of money flowing out. Over the last month, Bitcoin has fallen by 11.95%, reaching lows of $77,000. Due to falling prices and outflows, the total net assets of Bitcoin Spot ETFs have decreased by 21.70%. Like with Bitcoin, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA) saw the largest withdrawals at $63.3 million. Currently, the total money invested in Ethereum ETFs stands at $2.52 billion. The total net assets are $6.72 billion, which is about 2.90% of Ethereum’s market cap. Asset managers are looking to create ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies. Proposed funds might also include assets like Polkadot (DOT), Axelar (AXL), and Avalanche (AVAX). This push for altcoin ETFs shows growing interest in expanding beyond Bitcoin.

A group of traders coordinated an effort to liquidate the whale’s position by driving up Bitcoin’s price, but the attempt was unsuccessful. There is speculation that the whale may have insider information related to US President Donald Trump. The whale continues to manage their position through Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) transactions, having closed positions worth $18M while maintaining a 5,167 BTC short position. This large bearish bet comes despite Bitcoin recently bouncing back to its 200-day average above $84,000 over the weekend. Data from Hyperliquid and blockchain analysis firm Lookonchain shows the whale’s Bitcoin short position has a liquidation price of around $86,000. 11 hours ago, @Cbb0fe publicly formed a team to hunt this whale who shorted $BTC with 40x leverage. The MELANIA token is reportedly marketed by MKT World LLC. The whale’s contrarian trading strategy has caught widespread attention on social media. On Sunday, a pseudonymous trader with the username CBB publicly invited other market participants to form a group aimed at liquidating the whale’s position. This move helped them avoid liquidation of their position. The whale has continued to manage their position through Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) transactions. The total value of these transactions was over $18 million. The whale’s trading activities have sparked speculation about possible insider information. Some market commentators have suggested the trader may have connections to President Donald Trump, though no evidence has been presented to support these claims. In a separate post, CBB told traders to message them with “7 figs size only” as the combined funds of the team had already exceeded eight figures. In a statement on social media platform X, Hyperliquid said, This is not the first time Hyperliquid has seen massive leveraged positions. Earlier in March, another whale began a long position with 50x leverage for 175,000 ETH worth $340 million. Hyperliquid was forced to absorb the position at $1,915 in an effort to liquidate it, resulting in losses of more than $4 million for the platform.

As Pump.fun hits a snag, the new era begins with PepeX (PEPX) launching its presale on March 24, 2025. No doubt Solana-based Pump.fun has been the king of meme coin creation, launching 7.8 million tokens and raking in half a billion in fees. However, that’s all just stats for the trenches. The vast majority lose money as insiders and snipers become overnight millionaires. LIBRA, and recently WOLF – all linked to Hayden Davies – are an example. With anti-sniping protections, transparent bubble maps, and a strict 5% cap on founder allocations, it’s about leveling the playing field for degens. If a project tanks, founders lose their locked liquidity. PepeX handles everything about the meme coin – branding, marketing, community management, and decentralized exchange listing. Moreover, PEPX holders will have share in platform fees, which is projected to skyrocket as the meme market cap inches towards the $1 trillion mark. The project’s strapline says it all: “Making fair launches fair again.” Transparent token distribution, standardized smart contracts, and AI-driven tools eliminate friction and open meme coin creation to everyone. PepeX launches March 24, 2025, with a 90-day presale kicking off at $0.02 per token. 🔴 BREAKING: The WORLD'S FIRST AI powered meme launchpad PepeX, launching presale March 24! A fair, community-driven platform that puts the power back in YOUR hands. Excitement around PepeX goes beyond its quest to right Pump.fun wrongs. While skepticism abounds about meme coins and new launches, PepeX aims to change this perspective.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. In response to a March 16 inquiry from Representative Cha Gyu-geun of the National Assembly’s Planning and Finance Committee, the central bank pointed out the risks of Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, which can make it an unreliable asset for reserves. The central bank’s statement comes amid ongoing international discussions about the role of crypto in national reserves following U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent executive order to establish a strategic “crypto reserve,” with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) at its heart. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $83,450, marking a 23% decline from its peak of $109,000 in January, according to CoinGecko. “If the virtual asset market becomes unstable, there is a concern that transaction costs will increase rapidly in the process of converting Bitcoin into cash,” a spokesperson for the central bank said, according to reports in local media. The IMF requires foreign exchange reserves to be liquid, marketable, and in convertible currencies with investment-grade credit ratings—requirements that Bitcoin does not fulfill, the bank said. Just last week, a seminar hosted by the Democratic Party of Korea discussed the possibility of including Bitcoin in the country’s foreign exchange reserves, just a day before President Trump signed his executive order. Meanwhile, South Korea’s closest neighbour, Japan, has also shown hesitancy regarding the inclusion of Bitcoin in foreign reserves. Last December, Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba voiced concerns about insufficient information on the U.S. and other countries' plans for Bitcoin reserves. Ishiba’s concerns followed a proposal by Satoshi Hamada, a member of Japan’s House of Councilors, suggesting Japan explore converting a portion of its foreign reserves into Bitcoin.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

AI-powered cryptocurrencies like Bittensor and IntelMarkets have been on a remarkable upward trend, with last month’s 40% surge highlighting their potential. Investors are now left wondering: is this just the beginning of a much larger movement? Bittensor’s recent price action has captured significant attention in the crypto market, fueled by a bounce and a wave of new developments in the decentralized AI space. A minor bullish engulfing pattern has formed on TAO price charts, but Bittensor hasn’t pushed high enough to break free. Nevertheless, a breakout for TAO could be on the horizon, supported by several compelling factors. One major factor is President Trump’s $500 billion investment plan for AI development. While the funds focus on centralized AI, it could bring up conversations about the importance of decentralized AI, which is a space where Bittensor is already making its mark. Another factor is the recent partnership between Zuvu AI and Vana, aimed at enhancing decentralized artificial intelligence within Bittensor. Their objectives include establishing a more open and financially sustainable AI ecosystem. If these elements align, the Bittensor price could start climbing again. Can IntelMarkets Develop The AI Crypto Industry Just Like Bittensor Has? IntelMarkets is leveling the playing field in the DeFi market by giving everyday traders access to AI tools once reserved for hedge funds and big institutions. The platform uses a powerful security system called Codeum which ensures that users’ assets stay safe from hackers and third parties.

With Phase 1 continuing through March 31 and Phase 2 now completed, Ourbit is allocating 85% of the token’s 1 billion supply directly to community members through this multi-phase airdrop. This airdrop campaign coincides with Ourbit’s debut of the world’s first “SuperCEX,” a hybrid trading model that integrates DEX capabilities with centralized exchange functionality, poised to transcend the boundaries of CeFi and DeFi and reshape how crypto assets are traded. While traditional centralized exchanges have kept memecoins at arm’s length, Ourbit has consistently embraced them as a true cultural phenomena that drive expressions of community identity and crypto-native culture. The $BITCH airdrop mechanics retroactively reward Ourbit’s early users while incentivizing new user acquisition and high-frequency trading activity for its DEX platform: Invite & Earn – Users can complete daily tasks and invite others to sign up on Ourbit DEX to accumulate points, with $BITCH distribution determined based on the points earned. These fragments can be used to open mystery boxes, which may contain $BITCH rewards. The siloed nature of CeFi and DeFi has been a significant barrier to mainstream adoption. Ourbit has engineered a solution to one of crypto’s most persistent pain points. Its SuperCEX hybrid model is the industry’s first true integration of decentralized exchange (DEX) capabilities into a centralized platform. Ourbit’s SuperCEX delivers seamless access to both on-chain and off-chain assets through a single interface, fundamentally transforming how traders discover and access new assets: By combining the $BITCH memecoin with the SuperCEX model, Ourbit creates a practical solution for traders who want access to all types of crypto opportunities in one place. The SuperCEX approach breaks down the walls between centralized and decentralized systems, giving traders what they actually need: maximum degen trading potential unlocked with institutional-grade trading tools. Ourbit is the world’s 1st SuperCEX integrating CEX and DEX in one platform, allowing users to trade all on-chain and off-chain assets in just one app. Ourbit delivers the most comprehensive memecoin trading pairs, industry-leading memecoin liquidity, and prophetic listing strategy with a proven track record of identifying explosive gems before other exchanges ($SPX 96X, $VIRTUAL 56X, $KOMA 49X since listed on Ourbit). Founded by ex-founding teams of top-tier exchanges with authentic roots in memecoin ecosystems, Ourbit has earned official endorsements from memecoin projects such as Retardio, HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu and more.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

While ADA remains a strong performer in the crypto market, its whales are diversifying into MUTM. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is lining up to be a leading DeFi performer. The Mutuum Finance team is also undergoing its smart contract audit by CertiK, a vital step in establishing security and trust. Upon completion, the audit report will be posted officially on their social media. Making it one of the most undervalued yet high-potential DeFi projects, with its unique lending features and strong market demand, analysts anticipate the token to exceed $5 following its launch at $0.06. Through the P2C model, customers can gain passive income by being part of USDT liquidity pools while having smart contract-based automatic lending. By this combination of two systems, Mutuum Finance provides greater security, efficiency, and decentralization as a potential investment vehicle for high-yielding DeFi investors. A million-dollar giveaway will distribute $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens to 10 fortunate participants, while an innovative referral program incentivizes users for bringing in new investors. Early adopters also gain access to exclusive staking pools, governance rights, and VIP updates, fostering long-term engagement with the platform. The project’s tokenomics model is designed to ensure controlled supply and long-term price appreciation.

The hack was attributed to the Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korean hacking collective believed to be responsible for a string of high-profile cybercrimes. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou recently pointed out that nearly $100 million, or 40,233 ETH, from the $1.5 billion hack had flowed through OKX’s Web3 platform, with a significant portion of the funds now lost and untraceable. In a related development, Bloomberg reported on March 11 that regulators in the European Union are reportedly investigating OKX’s decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, questioning whether the exchange’s Web3 service is compliant with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. In light of the situation, OKX confirmed it had consulted with regulators and made the decision to pause its DEX aggregator services proactively. OKX's recent troubles are compounded by a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).

Amid the intensifying competition for blockchain supremacy, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stepping up to rival major networks such as Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). Yet, analysts are keeping a close watch on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been steadily capturing the interest of crypto enthusiasts. Mutuum Finance’s third presale phase is underway, drawing a surge of investor support thanks to its DeFi-focused model that offers a long-term, stable alternative to hype-driven meme tokens. Investor confidence remains strong, with more than $3.4 million raised and over 5,700 holders committing to the project. Automated interest rate adjustments are built in to sustain the network’s capital efficiency and stability. At the heart of Mutuum Finance’s approach is a dual-lending framework, combining: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Smart contracts manage lending pools, automatically fine-tuning interest rates based on market conditions. This model gives lenders reliable yields while helping borrowers secure funds with minimal friction. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Removing middlemen altogether, lenders and borrowers set up direct loan agreements, maximizing flexibility for assets that can be volatile. Further strengthening token value, a buyback mechanism is in place, offering both price appreciation and passive income to MUTM holders. Mutuum Finance encourages greater adoption by hosting a $100,000 giveaway, awarding $10,000 in MUTM to ten lucky winners.

Digital asset prime broker FalconX said Saturday it has completed the “first-ever” block trade for CME Group's Solana futures with StoneX as counterparty, a day ahead of the SOL futures launch of new contracts expected on March 17. ​Several asset management firms have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch Solana ETFs. Other firms, including Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital, have also filed for spot Solana ETFs. Solana futures follow the pattern established with Bitcoin and Ethereum, where futures trading preceded ETF authorization and approval from a regulatory body. The futures are then cash-settled based on the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate, calculated daily at 4:00 p.m. London time, providing a standardized benchmark for SOL's U.S. dollar price. FalconX operates as a key liquidity provider for CME Group's crypto derivatives suite.

Bitcoin and Ethereum extended losses on Sunday as traders braced for another volatile week, with U.S. stock futures pointing lower ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy meeting. Bitcoin slipped nearly 1.8% to trade around $82,700, while Ethereum dropped 2.5% to $1,889, as investors assessed the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting regulatory developments. Markets are increasingly focused on the Federal Reserve’s rate outlook, with futures traders pricing in a high probability that the central bank will hold interest rates steady this week. While expectations for rate cuts later this year remain intact, recent inflation data and strong labor market numbers have raised concerns that the Fed may delay easing monetary policy on Wednesday. A more hawkish stance could weigh on risk assets, including crypto, which have traded in lockstep with equities in recent months. President Trump’s recent announcement of new tariffs and potential retaliatory measures from the European Union have injected fresh uncertainty into global markets. In addition, his executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve briefly fueled speculation about U.S. government involvement in crypto markets before investors realized no immediate budget had been allocated for purchases. Funding rates, which briefly turned negative during last week’s sell-off, have returned to neutral, suggesting uncertainty in market positioning. With macroeconomic risks mounting and regulatory developments unfolding, traders are looking for a catalyst to break the current downtrend.

Bitcoin's (BTC) ongoing price pullback could accelerate below $80K, as on-chain analysis by Glassnode indicates that the $10K price range beneath this level was marked by weak economic activity late last year. BTC prices quickly rose from $70K to above $80K in early November after pro crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. As a result, very little BTC changed hands between those levels, leaving a so-called "supply gap," as evident from Glassnode's UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart.

South Korea's central bank, the Bank of Korea (BOK), has taken a cautious stance on including bitcoin in its foreign exchange reserves, per a Korea Economic Daily report.

In response to a question posed by a member of the National Assembly's Strategy and Finance Committee, the BOK made it clear on Sunday that it has not entertained the notion of embracing BTC.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Long & Short Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

The primary deterrent for the BOK is bitcoin's notorious price instability, where the central bank fears that the wild swings in the crypto market could substantially inflate transaction costs when converting bitcoin to cash, posing a significant risk to its reserves.

The BOK further pointed out that bitcoin fails to meet the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) foreign exchange reserve management standards. The IMF emphasizes the importance of prudently managing liquidity, market, and credit risks — criteria that bitcoin, with its erratic nature, does not satisfy.

South Korea enjoys a flourishing crypto ecosystem, with local startups, tokens, exchanges and firms contributing billions of dollars in daily trading volumes within a relatively insular crypto market.

Just two months ago, when Trump took office, the crypto market was buzzing with optimism that any turbulence created by tariffs would lead to prompt policy support from the White House. Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said corrections are healthy and normal, a hint that the anticipated "Trump put" might take longer to materialize than traders hoped. This starkly contrasts with government officials' typical attitude of emphasizing "glass half full" perspective when the going gets tough. It could mean Trump isn't ready to back down from his tariff fight just yet, keeping risk assets feeling uneasy. If stock prices continue to fall, it's hard to imagine bitcoin staying resilient for long, especially given the lack of uplifting narratives in the crypto market.

"I’ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy, they are normal,” Bessent said Sunday on NBC’s Meet The Press, according to Bloomberg. Over the long term, if we put good tax policy in place, deregulation and energy security, the markets will do great.” See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Bessent's comment contradicts popular belief that the Trump administration will quickly douse any fire stemming from the administration's policy moves, particularly trade tariffs. President Donald Trump also recently clarified his stance, saying he is not looking at the stock market. Wall Street's tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 entered correction last week, falling over 10% from their February highs predominantly on concerns that Trump's tariffs could slow economic growth while leading to sticky inflation. Bitcoin (BTC), too, has taken a beating, down nearly 25% from the record highs above $109K in January, according to CoinDesk Indices data, tracking the risk-off on Wall Street and digesting disappointment over the absence of fresh BTC purchases under Trump's strategic digital assets reserve plan. However, Bessent's take suggests that it may take longer to manifest or require more significant market declines before any action is taken. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues stressed early this month that they are watching to see the “net effects” of Trump's policies on the economy and are not in a hurry to cut rates. Officials will meet for a rate review this week, with the decision due Wednesday.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Now, it and other memecoins are being proposed as assets for a new slew of cryptocurrency ETFs. In just over a month, the U.S. crypto market went from facing an absurd amount of obstruction to an absurd amount of, well, absurdity. While I can scarcely imagine a financial advisor telling me, “You’re slightly under-allocated in $TRUMP coin,” the reality is that these new currencies could be valid assets for an ETF. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . They’re not a symphony by Mozart, sure, but these coins — $BONK, $PENGU — clearly have some cultural value. I can see why some investors, retail and otherwise, would be interested in an ETF of this kind. This brings us to Solana, which is now essentially the 3rd largest asset in terms of market cap and by far the largest in terms of network usage. Read more: ‘It’s So Early’: How Solana Is Competing With Ethereum for Institutional Interest It took 10 long years and a lawsuit for the Bitcoin ETF to be approved. Every issuer that included providing “staking” rewards in their applications had to strike it. If, instead of ETF shares, these investors bought the same amount of Ethereum and staked it (for example, with Coinbase), they could earn, say, 2-4% APY, in return for letting their ETH be used to keep the blockchain secure. Whatever your politics, and however you feel about cryptocurrencies, the truth is that this puts American investors at a disadvantage. And yet, in the U.S., we are still waiting for a Solana ETF of any kind. As for why that staking ETF should be for Solana, well — the fact that the president’s memecoin was released on Solana is no accident. Not giving investors access to invest in this technology through their traditional financial accounts is like if we limited investors to invest in Amazon or Google during their initial offerings. This is why a Solana ETF should be quickly approved: to give the broad retail and institutional investors access to the next biggest asset after Bitcoin and Ethereum. In short: Solana is overdue for an ETF of its own, and I urge the new leadership at the SEC to approve the applications they have inherited from those including Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Bitwise - and even encourage them reintegrate staking rewards into their proposals. (Canary’s application has reached a second stage of SEC review, indicating it could be approved in due course.)</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ethena, which offers a yield-bearing USDe token as well as a BUIDL-backed USDtb stablecoin, will migrate its $6 billion DeFi ecosystem to Converge, while Securitize, the transfer agent for BlackRock’s BUIDL token, will bring its suite of tokenized real world assets (RWAs), like the recently-issued Apollo credit fund token, to the new chain.

From in the early days of DeFi there has been a concerted effort to expand beyond cryptocurrencies and bring traditional assets on chain as collateral. “Tokenization, per se, is just putting your securities on a different ledger, and it produces cost savings and efficiencies, but it doesn't necessarily lead to anything significantly different in terms of what you can do with these assets,” said Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo in an interview. “On the other hand, crypto has been developing very novel ways of using digital assets. Converge will be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling it to run Ethereum-based smart contracts, dApps, and tools without modification. It will boast performance that is in line with industry-leading blockchains, according to a press release.

Une conférence de pays donateurs s'est engagée lundi à fournir 5,8 milliards d'euros d'aide à la reconstruction de la Syrie, moins que son engagement précédent, faute de l'apport des États-Unis.Cette neuvième édition a accueilli pour la première fois des représentants des autorités en place à Damas, après la prise du pouvoir par une coalition dirigée par Ahmad al-Chareh qui a mis fin à plus d'un demi-siècle de règne sans partage du clan Assad. "J'ai l'honneur de vous annoncer que tous ensemble, nous nous sommes engagés sur un total de 5,8 milliards d'euros, 4,2 milliards d'euros en dons et 1,6 en prêts", a déclaré la commissaire européenne pour la Méditerranée Dubravka Suica, au terme de la neuvième édition de cette conférence internationale.Ce chiffre est nettement inférieur à l'engagement pris par cette même conférence l'an dernier, qui avait atteint 7,5 milliards d'euros. "Pendant les 14 dernières années, les États-Unis ont fourni davantage d'assistance pour le peuple syrien que n'importe quelle autre nation, soit plus de 18,3 milliards de dollars", a rappelé Natasha Franceschi, la représentante américaine à cette conférence.Elle a indiqué que son pays continuerait à fournir une aide, "conformément aux lois américaines", mais que Washington s'attendait désormais à ce que les autres pays prennent le relais. Elle n'a toutefois fourni aucun chiffre.L'Union européenne s'est engagée de son côté à fournir près de 2,5 milliards d'euros, soit davantage que son engagement précédent.- Transition difficile -La transition reste difficile dans ce pays divisé entre plusieurs communautés religieuses. Des massacres ont été commis ces dernières semaines dans l'ouest, les pires violences depuis l'arrivée de cette coalition menée par le groupe islamiste sunnite Hayat Tahrir al-Cham (HTS).C'est le ministre syrien des Affaires étrangères, Assaad al-Chaibani, qui a pris la parole lundi au nom de son pays. "Le temps de la tyrannie est terminé. Nous ne ménagerons aucun de nos efforts pour traduire en justice quiconque a perpétré un tel crime, a du sang sur les mains", a assuré le chef de la diplomatie syrienne, selon une traduction simultanée de son discours prononcé en arabe.Les forces de sécurité, des groupes armés alliés ou des djihadistes étrangers ont été rendus responsables de ces violences qui ont fait, selon une ONG, près de 1.400 morts dans la population civile, principalement au sein de la communauté alaouite, une branche du chiisme, dont est issu l'ancien président Bachar al-Assad.Les Vingt-Sept, qui ont très vite après le 8 décembre décidé de soutenir la transition en Syrie, veulent y voir un phénomène isolé. "Nous condamnons avec force ces attaques, particulièrement celles ciblant les civils. Elles doivent être traitées rapidement et de manière décisive", a insisté la cheffe de la diplomatie Kaja Kallas, tout en saluant la création d'une commission d'enquête.- "Créer le chaos" -Interrogée plus tôt en conférence de presse sur l'éventualité d'interrompre la levée progressive des sanctions décidée fin février par l'UE, Mme Kallas a assuré que ce processus devait être maintenu, car sinon le risque était de "créer la chaos" dans tout le pays.Si la communauté internationale n'aide pas la Syrie à "se remettre sur pied", une nouvelle vague migratoire est à craindre, a mis en garde lundi à Bruxelles Mirjana Spoljaric, la présidente du Comité international de la Croix-Rouge.Les 27 sont toutefois prêts à reconsidérer leur décision sur les sanctions, si d'autres violences de ce type devaient se reproduire, ont averti des diplomates.En attendant, les besoins sont énormes. "Après 14 ans de guerre, l'économie syrienne a perdu quelque 800 milliards de dollars de son Produit intérieur brut (PIB), les infrastructures pour des services essentiels ont été détruites", a déploré le secrétaire général des Nations unies Antonio Guterres, dans un message vidéo adressée à la conférence.ob/jca/jp</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ethereum developers launched a new test network, Hoodi, on Monday that will be used to carry out the blockchain's upcoming 'Pectra' upgrade. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Pectra will go live on Hoodi on March 26, and if all goes well, the long-awaited upgrade will proceed to Etheruem's mainnet roughly 30 days later, according to the network's core developers. Hoodi was created following faulty Pectra tests on Ethereum’s other testnets, Holesky and Sepolia, which failed to finalize properly due to problems with how they were configured. Originally, the Pectra upgrade would have been activated on Ethereum following those two earlier tests. Because they didn't go smoothly, developers decided to build Hoodi to test the ambitious Pectra upgrade one more time, although the testnet can also be used for future tests. Hoodi is designed to mimic Ethereum’s mainnet, with the same number of validators on its network. Holesky and Sepolia were built for different purposes: Holesky has a bigger validator set than Ethereum’s mainnet, which is supposed to help test out scalability problems, while Sepolia is a closed network just for developers, meant for testing out applications. One of the biggest changes includes adding "smart contract" capabilities that could give wallets new features, like the ability to pay gas fees in cryptocurrencies other than ether (ETH).

The collaboration between the two firms comes as artificial intelligence (AI) tools are seeping into every corner of online life — including inside of video games, which have been plagued by non-human AI "bots" since long before the rise of Altman's ChatGPT. According to a study from Echelon Insights that World shared with CoinDesk, roughly 59% of gamers said that they regularly encountered unauthorized, third-party bots in their games. In addition to posing a general nuisance to players, bot accounts often have tactical advantages over real players, which can ruin the competitiveness of some multiplayer games. “Game developers now have a tool to build dynamic spaces where real players —not bots— dominate the digital landscape,” World said in its statement. It's an apt pairing: the game's main premise involves humans coexisting with autonomous androids. When users log into TOKYO BEAST, they will be prompted to sign in using a World-authenticated Razer ID, ensuring they can play online with real human players only. “By teaming up with World, we’re ensuring that real players are the heart of every experience, keeping gaming fair, immersive, and designed for humans.” Read more: Sam Altman's World Network Unveils New Chat Feature to Connect Real Humans</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Grassroots support for two bitcoin improvement proposals (BIP) appears to be emerging for Bitcoin’s next soft fork, centered around two candidates: BIPs 119 and 348. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . BIPs are the formal method for discussion of proposed changes to Bitcoin. Often, these BIPs are referred to by nicknames and multiple proposals may be included in a soft fork. Get Blockspace articles directly in your inbox by clicking here. Bitcoin’s technical community typically debates these BIPs exhaustively. The Taproot Wizards–a Bitcoin development firm most well known for its Bitcoin NFTs–put out a helpful graphic explaining the confusing and seemingly circular process of these discussions. In short, the Bitcoin soft fork process requires a rough estimate of support from Bitcoin’s stakeholders, including developers, custodians, investors and miners. Still, there’s no definitive heuristic for defining what “widespread support” looks like, and Bitcoin consensus is a constantly evolving, moving target. Over the course of February and March, we’ve registered a definite shift as numerous developers gave their explicit support for the two BIPs. Over the course of the last few weeks, numerous Western Bitcoin developers tweeted their support for CTV and CSFS – a strong signal that at least the Twitterverse is coming together in favor of certain changes to Bitcoin. CTV and CSFS allow new ways of writing Bitcoin script. Proposed by former Bitcoin core contributor Jeremy Rubin, CTV has been around for more than half a decade, whereas CSFS was only formalized in November 2024 by Jeremy Rubin and Brandon Black. Covenants are generally expected to significantly improve the landscape for Bitcoin self-custody, fee management, and enhance existing Bitcoin tech like Lightning, Ark, and contract-based applications. Additionally, developers consider these two proposals to be “narrowly defined.” In layman's terms, this means, if they are activated, there is a low probability of users exploiting them for something unexpected. You may remember that Rubin’s previous campaign for CTV received strong pushback – notably from Bitcoiners with large followings, including Adam Back and Jimmy Song. The criticisms evolved into significant pushback from many in the bitcoin community, finally leading to Rubin taking a step back from Bitcoin all together. It’s important to note that most OP_CAT supporters are also in favor of BIPs 119 and 348 (and most proposals in general). However, there isn’t a formalized process for “how to soft fork Bitcoin.” So we’re left with a lot of open questions. For example, will a potential soft fork include just CTV and CSFS? Will OP_CAT – which is often included in this opcode suite – join the conversation? And will other stakeholders like Bitcoin miners take note?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The BOK also stressed that Bitcoin does not meet the management standards of exchange reserves of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF highlights the importance of prudent management of liquidity, market and credit risks, criteria that Bitcoin, by its erratic nature, does not meet.
