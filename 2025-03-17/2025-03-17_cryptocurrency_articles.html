Amid revolutionary announcements, technological developments, and regulatory turbulence, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove that it is both a realm of limitless innovations and a battlefield for regulatory and economic struggles. Here is a summary of the most notable news from the past week regarding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple.

Despite a 25% drop in the price of Bitcoin and a decrease in inflows, Bitcoin ETFs maintain 95% of their assets under management, which amounts to approximately $115 billion. This behavior, similar to that of traditional ETFs, indicates a shift in investor perception towards a more long-term approach. However, warning signs are emerging with capital outflows reaching $1.6 billion over the last month and a decline in BTC demand, which could signal potential turbulence in the market. üîó Read the full article

The case between the SEC and Ripple could finally be coming to an end after four years of legal battle. The commission is considering ending the proceedings following a judgment that fined Ripple $125 million. If appeals are abandoned by both sides, the decision will remain in place, but in case of disagreement, a new negotiation will be necessary. This potential conclusion coincides with a shift in direction from the SEC, which is dropping other lawsuits against crypto companies. üîó Read the full article

Bitcoin reinforces its grip on the crypto market with a dominance of 61.2%, confirming the slowdown of the altcoins rally. After a brief spike linked to Donald Trump's election, investors are retreating to BTC, seen as a safe-haven asset in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. If this trend continues, Bitcoin's supremacy may further increase, especially as institutions continue to adopt it on a wide scale. üîó Read the full article

The crypto platform Binance has received a $2 billion investment from MGX, a fund based in Abu Dhabi. This fundraising, conducted in stablecoins, is the largest ever in the crypto sector. CZ took advantage of the announcement to discuss a possible ‚Äúaltcoin season,‚Äù fueling speculation about a new bullish cycle for alternative cryptos. This investment could also help Binance solidify its dominant position and navigate an increasingly strict regulatory environment. üîó Read the full article

Marine Le Pen proposes to exploit surplus nuclear electricity to power Bitcoin mining. During a visit to the EPR in Flamanville, she criticized the underutilization of the French nuclear fleet, which operates at 70% capacity compared to 90% in the United States. Instead of reducing production during low-demand periods, she wants to channel excess energy into crypto mining to generate income for EDF. While this initiative appeals to some industry players, it also raises questions about its environmental impact and economic viability. üîó Read the full article

The speculative frenzy surrounding memecoins ended abruptly, leading to a 93% drop in Solana's revenue, which fell from $55.3 million to $4 million per week. The Pump.fun site, which accounted for 80% of the network's revenue, saw its activity collapse after the fall of the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens. Solana's TVL has lost nearly 50%, and the price of SOL has dropped by 58% in just a few weeks. This crisis highlights the network's dependence on speculative cycles and raises doubts about its ability to build a more stable and diversified ecosystem. üîó Read the full article

March 17, 2025 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Investorideas.com, rated as a top 100 investment website for investing ideas, issues market commentary from Rania Gule, Senior Market Analyst at XS.com - MENA

Bitcoin has recently experienced significant volatility, starting at $83,000 and recording an 8% gain from its weekly low of $76,000. Despite these gains, Bitcoin remains trapped in a zone between risks and opportunities, with tight price movements and a lack of clear direction in the market. While there have been some indicators supporting short-term gains for Bitcoin, economic and geopolitical pressures could lead to further declines.

Last week, financial markets closely monitored developments in the trade war between the U.S. and Canada, which overshadowed investor reactions to economic data showing declining inflation. Under these circumstances, Bitcoin trading volumes fell for the third consecutive week, reflecting, in my opinion, a decrease in public interest in the cryptocurrency. The trade war, exacerbated by harsh statements from President Donald Trump, has been a factor that overshadowed any optimism from better-than-expected economic data. This trade war poses a threat to the future of financial markets in general, including cryptocurrency markets, where investors remain cautious about potential economic fluctuations.

On the other hand, Bitcoin started the week within a narrow range between $76,000 and $84,000, a range it struggled to break out of for several days, reflecting market uncertainty. From my perspective, this relative stability indicates that the catalysts for significant price movements are currently absent, with decreased activity in the cryptocurrency market. In recent days, Bitcoin prices briefly fell below the $80,000 support level, reflecting the market's fragility in the face of global political and economic volatility.

Therefore, I expect Bitcoin to face weaker support if prices continue to decline in the coming week. If prices fall below $80,000 again, it could lead to a retest of the key support level, prompting traders to adjust their strategies more cautiously. This shift in market direction could increase the likelihood of new sell-offs, further pressuring the price and raising the chances of it dropping to lower levels.

Another factor that had a significant impact this week was the decisions made by Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Despite the ETFs seeing positive inflows of $13 million on Wednesday, the outflows from the market were larger, with investors pulling out an additional $830 million during the week, bringing the total outflows to $1.7 billion in March. This indicates that the market is still suffering from uncertainty, and the economic and geopolitical landscape could affect investor confidence in cryptocurrencies.

Regarding future expectations, some indicators may support Bitcoin in the coming weeks, despite the significant risks. Forecasts suggest that the Federal Reserve is highly likely to halt rate hikes in March, which could improve risk appetite among investors. If this happens, it could lead to more funds flowing into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, supporting a potential price rebound. Additionally, the chances of a resolution between Russia and Ukraine are approaching 75%, which could ease the geopolitical pressures that have been a negative factor in the markets.

Looking at geopolitical incentives, the potential decisions regarding Bitcoin from the U.S. government cannot be overlooked. Florida gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds is preparing to introduce a bill to protect Trump's policy on Bitcoin reserves, reflecting a political trend aimed at supporting Bitcoin's stability as an investment asset. This development could have a positive impact on the market if approved, as it would enhance confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term investment asset.

However, risks remain, in my opinion. Especially if the U.S.-Canada trade war escalates further, and if stock markets decline as a result of global monetary policy fluctuations, Bitcoin may face additional downward pressure. Therefore, investors must monitor developments related to Federal Reserve monetary policies and any political actions that could affect global financial stability.

In the end, the future of Bitcoin remains surrounded by significant geopolitical and financial risks, but some opportunities could arise from a halt in rate hikes and easing geopolitical tensions. As the situation in the trade war and monetary policy trends evolve, the coming week could be crucial for Bitcoin, as market directions become clearer. Although Bitcoin may face the risk of dropping to $75,000, the chances of a rebound to $90,000 may remain if economic and geopolitical conditions improve.

The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has proposed restricting cryptocurrency transactions to the wealthiest individuals, preventing most citizens from trading digital assets unless they meet stringent financial criteria.

Under the proposed framework, only individuals classified as "especially qualified investors" would be permitted to buy and sell cryptocurrency. This status would be granted to those with financial assets exceeding RUB100mn ($1.2mn) or an annual income above RUB50mn ($580,000). The proposal also suggests allowing companies already classified as qualified investors under current legislation to participate in the experiment. These include professional financial market participants such as banks, insurance companies, brokers, trust managers, non-state pension funds and asset management companies for mutual investment funds.

The CBR argues that cryptocurrencies pose significant risks due to their volatility and lack of state backing. Beyond these wealthy investors, the regulator has proposed a "ban on transactions between residents using cryptocurrency."

"The Bank of Russia still does not recognise cryptocurrency as a means of payment," the CBR stated, adding that digital assets "are not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction, are based on mathematical algorithms, and are highly volatile."

The proposal is part of ongoing efforts to regulate digital assets in Russia, where authorities have long maintained a sceptical stance on cryptocurrency. While private individuals are already prohibited from using crypto for payments, ownership is not banned, and the government has permitted limited use in international transactions under an experimental legal framework. This has gained importance following the imposition of Western sanctions after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Moscow Exchange has indicated its readiness to launch crypto-related trading instruments once a regulatory structure is in place.

Despite government resistance to widespread cryptocurrency adoption, Russia has gradually introduced measures to regulate digital assets. In 2024, the country legalised cryptocurrency mining under specific conditions, while a new tax regime for digital assets took effect in 2025.

The global altcoin market is agog with activity as investors rotate assets across the markets to navigate the market lull.

Among mega-cap altcoins, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have taken center stage, driven by significant ecosystem developments. 

For Solana, the CME Group, one of the world's largest institutional trading platforms, has confirmed the launch of Solana ETF futures on Monday.

This news aligns with the blockchain marking its fifth anniversary ‚Äî forming a dual bullish catalyst.

Ethereum's "Hoodi" testnet goes live on Monday, marking a key step toward boosting DeFi capabilities and scalability.

ETH price has increased by 1.7% to reclaim the $1,900 level at press time, signalling widespread optimism around the network update.

Taking a broader look at the market, here's a breakdown of the day's standout performers and laggards:

 The price action among major altcoins reflects a mixed market sentiment :

The current market dynamic signals that despite positive catalysts from Solana fifth birthday and SOL futures ETF launch on CME Group, fears surrounding the FXT estate's recent token unlocks continue to weigh heavily on SOL's short-term price momentum. 

In response, investors are strategically channeling funds toward Solana's layer-1 rivals, XRP and LTC, with ETF filings in progress. 

Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram linked to the development of blockchain network Toncoin, has announced his return to Dubai after spending several months in France due to an ongoing investigation into criminal activities on the messaging platform.
 
Durov expressed gratitude to the investigative judges for permitting his return and thanked his legal team and the Telegram community for their support. 

He emphasized that Telegram has consistently exceeded legal obligations concerning moderation and cooperation with law enforcement.

The investigation, which began with Durov's arrest in August near Paris, centers on allegations that Telegram facilitated illegal activities such as the distribution of child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking.

VanEck has submitted a filing to the US Securities & Exchange Commission for an Avalanche (AVAX) ETF, aiming to provide investors with direct exposure to the smart contract platform.

The proposed fund will track AVAX's price performance while deducting operating expenses.

According to the filing, the ETF will value its shares based on the MarketVector Avalanche Benchmark Rate.

If approved, this would mark one of the first AVAX-focused ETFs in the US, expanding institutional access to the Avalanche ecosystem.

OKX has temporarily halted its decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator after identifying misuse linked to the North Korean hacking group Lazarus.

The exchange announced the suspension as a precautionary measure while conducting an internal review and implementing additional security upgrades.

Despite the suspension, OKX will continue to offer wallet services but will restrict new wallet creation in certain markets.

The platform's security enhancements aim to strengthen defenses against hacker activity and prevent further exploitation of its DeFi services.

Amid a 2% decrease in market capitalization, crypto trading volume surges 42% to $87.2 billion in the last 24 hours, signalling active capital rotation. Bitcoin price stagnates below $85,000 as Gold enters a record rally to $3,000 ahead of the US Fed rate decision.

The US SEC postponed its decisions on several spot altcoin ETF applications this week, including those for Litecoin, XRP and Solana. A K33 Research report shows there is consensus but the agency is waiting the confirmation of Trump's nominee for SEC Chair. 

Bitcoin price remained constrained within a tight 8% channel between $76,000 and $84,472 this week. With conflicting market catalysts preventing prolonged directional swings, here are key factors that moved BTC prices this week, as well as key indicators to watch in the weeks ahead.

Bitcoin (BTC) daily price chart shows signs of recovery in the largest cryptocurrency. Strategy, one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, acquired another 130 BTC last week, according to an announcement on Monday. 

Ethereum (ETH) gained 1.54%, and XRP added 2.40% to its value today. 

Bitcoin trades at $83,000 at the time of writing. Technical indicators on the BTC/USDT daily price chart support a thesis of gains in the largest cryptocurrency. 

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 42 and is sloping upward. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line. The Bitcoin price trend has an underlying positive momentum on the daily timeframe. 

The two key momentum indicators support Bitcoin's gains, and a return to resistance at the $90,000 level is likely. 

BTC price is currently 8.35% away from the $90,000 resistance. The $90,000 level is key to Bitcoin price since the token has been hovering under this level since March 7, as observed in the BTC/USDT chart below:





BTC/USDT daily price chart 

Ethereum trades at $1,902 at the time of writing. The largest altcoin in the crypto market looks prepared to test the psychologically important $2,000 level and attempt to close above the resistance. 

The $2,000 level holds significance as it remained as key support for Ethereum for over a year, as observed on the ETH/USDT daily price chart. 

A 5% rally from the current price could push Ether to $2,000. A successful daily candlestick close above the $2,000 mark could push the altcoin toward resistance at the lower boundary of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $2,533. 

The rally to $2,533 would mark an over 30% gain from the current ETH price. 

Two key momentum indicators, the RSI and MACD, support Ether's recent gains. The RSI is sloping upward and reads 34, while the MACD shows an underlying positive momentum in Ethereum price trend. 



ETH/USDT daily price chart 

A failure to test the $2,000 level could imply weakness in Ether's price trend and the nearly 16-month low at $1,754 could come into play as support. 

XRP trades at $2.3386 at the time of writing on Monday. The altcoin gained nearly 2% on the day, and the momentum indicators on the daily price chart support gains in XRP. 

The 50% Fibonacci retracement of XRP's decline from the peak of $3.40 to the February low of $1.7711 ‚Äî at $2.5856 ‚Äî is a key resistance for the altcoin. A rally to this level could mark 10% gains in XRP. 

The RSI reads 48 and is sloping upward, while the MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line.



XRP/USDT daily price chart

In the event of a flash crash in Bitcoin, altcoins like XRP and Ether could face a correction. XRP could find support at the multi-month low of $1.7711 if there is a serious decline in the altcoin's price. 

Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told FXStreet that the recent Bitcoin pullback put the spotlight on the $82,000 and $85,000 support levels. 

Lee said, ‚ÄúIt's a classic post-rally consolidation phase that is healthy but also a test of whether Bitcoin's recent momentum has real staying power. Institutional buying and the buzz around a potential US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve continue to prop up sentiment, but with resistance looming near $85,000‚Äì$90,000, a breakout won't come easy. 

Let's not forget the macro wildcard: any unexpected FOMC moves could throw a wrench into the market. If sentiment turns bearish, we could see Bitcoin dip toward $75,000‚Äì$80,000, though a bullish macro backdrop could send it climbing back to $90,000.‚Äù

Observing that Ethereum and Bitcoin are tightly correlated and the altcoin tends to respond to shifts in the BTC price trend, Lee told FXStreet:

‚ÄúThe ETH/BTC ratio's weakness suggests Ethereum is struggling to find independent strength, even with promising developments on the horizon. The Pectra upgrade and ongoing Layer 2 expansion give it a bullish long-term case, but in the short term, those fundamentals might not be enough to break resistance at $2,300‚Äì$2,500 without Bitcoin leading the charge. If market sentiment sours, ETH could slip to $1,800, but Ethereum could push toward the top of its range if BTC stages a recovery. Right now, it's a waiting game‚Äîdoes Bitcoin hold the line, or does the market need a deeper reset before the next leg up?‚Äù

The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has nixed Zeux Limited's attempt to secure registration as a cryptoasset exchange provider.

The application, submitted in June 2022, showed that the firm had failed to implement anti-money laundering controls and carry out effective risk management.

The anti-money laundering controls put forward by Zeux Limited fell well short of legislative requirements. Registration of the firm would have posed a significant risk of harm to the public.

The application showed:

These points are critical for mitigating the risks of money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions evasion that a customer may pose.

Cryptoasset exchange providers must be registered with the FCA and comply with the UK money laundering regulations to operate legally in the UK.

Vantagepoint A.I., the pioneer in A.I.-powered trading software, has expanded its cryptocurrency forecasting capabilities after extensive neural network training and validation, enabling traders to navigate the exciting broader crypto market with greater confidence.

WESLEY CHAPEL, Fla., March 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve at lightning speed, and Vantagepoint A.I. remains at the forefront of market forecasting. As the first company in the world to bring the power of artificial intelligence to independent traders' home computers in 1991, Vantagepoint A.I. has also been strategically training its neural networks to recognize patterns and market correlations in cryptocurrencies long before they became mainstream financial assets.

VantagePoint's renowned predictive forecasting technology now includes ten additional cryptocurrencies: Avalanche (AVAX), Binance (BNB), Cosmos\Cronos (CRO), Filecoin (FIL), Internet Computer (ICP), Leo (LEO), Near Protocol (NEAR), OKB (OKB), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Tron (TRX). These join the software's existing lineup of major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), in addition to 48 cryptocurrency cross pairs.

"We're thrilled to add these 10 dynamic cryptocurrencies to our forecasting capabilities," says Lane Mendelsohn, President of Vantagepoint A.I. "Our team has been watching these assets develop, and now that they've met our rigorous accuracy standards, we can confidently offer these forecasts to our traders. In the crypto world, having predictive insights with a high proven accuracy, 1-3 days in advance, can make all the difference between a winning strategy and a costly mistake."

Mendelsohn adds, "While cryptocurrency trading always carries inherent risk, our dual-patented A.I. technology gives traders a significant edge. We've been perfecting our A.I. systems since 1991, long before most people had even heard of artificial intelligence. Now, as many inexperienced companies jump on the A.I. bandwagon, we're proud to be the established authority with a proven track record spanning over three decades."

The VantagePoint software predictive forecasts provide crucial technical analysis in the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency market. VantagePoint helps more than 47,000 traders across 160 countries make more informed decisions with greater confidence.

Beyond technological innovation, Vantagepoint A.I. maintains its commitment to giving back to the community. As a family-owned business based in Tampa Bay, the company regularly donates a portion of its revenue to organizations including Shriners Hospitals for Children and The Children's Cancer Center, and other local and national charitable initiatives.

Traders interested in seeing how VantagePoint's expanded cryptocurrency forecasting works can participate in a free live demonstration. To witness this powerful A.I. technology in action and learn how it can transform your trading strategy, schedule your demonstration at www.vantagepointsoftware.com/demo.

This reserve is purported to modernize the nation's financial strategy by holding digital assets‚Äîsuch as Bitcoin‚Äîas part of its national reserves. Since the reserve's establishment, the price of Bitcoin has experienced a sharp sell-off as investors reacted to the order's potential regulatory and market implications....

The cryptocurrency market is teetering as the stablecoin supply surges past $219 billion, a sign that the bullish momentum may still have some way to run. This trend, detailed by Yahoo Finance, typically heralds investor interest, with stablecoins acting as a bridge from fiat to crypto markets. According to insights from the IndexBox platform, the last comparable surge in stablecoin supply, which hit $187 billion in April 2022, preceded a bearish market turn.

However, the broader crypto market is experiencing a correction. Ethereum value has plummeted more than 50% from its December 2024 highs, raising concerns among traders. A dip below the $1,900 mark, a crucial demand zone, is predicted by some analysts and could trigger further buy-in. The market's eyes are on the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 19, which could provide direction based on recent economic data. With the U.S. economy showing signs of slowing, suggested by declining jobless claims and the Producer Price Index (PPI), many predict the Federal Reserve will maintain current interest rates, thus providing much-needed market clarity.

Despite the short-term market jitters, some experts hold a bullish long-term view. Investment firm VanEck posits that Ether could reach $6,000, and Bitcoin might soar to $180,000 by the end of 2025, reflecting the potential enduring upward trend in the market. Investors remain hopeful that the current correction, coupled with the increased stablecoin supply, signals that the bull market is still well in play, with critical guidance anticipated from the FOMC's proceedings as they unfold.

As Bitcoin nears $100,000, market watchers anticipate short-term consolidation, though the asset's uptrend is likely to continue.

Bitcoin (BTC) price returning to $100,000 could prompt ‚Äúshort-term consolidation,‚Äù analysts warn, though the long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency remains positive. While key psychological levels often lead to profit-taking, analysts point to gold's rise to new all-time highs as a sign of growing momentum for alternative assets.

Analysts at Matrixport noted that the shift in sentiment that began in the summer of 2023, when gold broke above $2,000, has boosted the outlook for Bitcoin since it has increasingly been seen as a form of ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù a narrative popularized by investment giant firm BlackRock.

‚ÄúRegardless of the prevailing narrative, both gold and Bitcoin are poised to grow in importance as alternative assets gain momentum. While key psychological levels-such as gold at $3,000 or Bitcoin at $100,000-could trigger short-term consolidation, the broader uptrend likely remains intact.‚Äù

As crypto.news explained earlier, Bitcoin now faces two potential risks and two opportunities. First, there are signs that investor sentiment remains fearful.

While the fear and greed index has moved out of the extreme fear zone (18), it still sits in the fear zone at 22. Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies perform better when the index is in the greedy zone. This continued fear is reflected in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which saw $143 million in assets leave, bringing total weekly outflows to $870 million. These funds have experienced outflows for five consecutive weeks.

Second, Bitcoin has formed a death cross as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages crossed, signaling potential downside.

Bitcoin's market has seen a major reset, with over $10 billion in open interest wiped out in just two months, leading analysts to believe that a Bitcoin price recovery is imminent.

According CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost's latest market analysis post on X, on Jan. 17, Bitcoin's (BTC) open interest hit a record $33 billion, signaling extreme leverage in the market. However, political uncertainty tied to former U.S. President Donald Trump's recent actions led to a wave of liquidations.

Subsequently, nearly $10 billion in open interest vanished between Feb. 20 and Mar. 4. This sharp decline pushed Bitcoin's 90-day futures open interest change down to -14%, often signaling market resets before price recoveries. Analysts believe that eliminating excessive speculation, these stages provide a more stable basis for future growth. 

Bitcoin's long-term outlook is still optimistic despite the decline. According to economist Timothy Peterson, April and October are usually when Bitcoin experiences the biggest seasonal gains. Peterson's most recent analysis reveals that Bitcoin might hit new all-time highs before June, with a median target of $126,000.

In addition, his ‚ÄúLowest Price Forward‚Äù model, which estimates a price level that Bitcoin is unlikely to drop below in future trading, indicates that Bitcoin's price floor has now risen to $69,000, with a 95% chance of holding. Past bull markets have shown that corrections like Bitcoin's recent 30% pullback often precede strong rebounds.

However, not all analysts are fully bullish. Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse, warned on a Mar. 15 YouTube stream that Bitcoin's bull cycle could be in jeopardy if it drops below the 2024 highs, which is in the lower $70,000s. Cowen compares the current cycle to 2017 when Bitcoin retested the prior year's high. 

He suggests the bull market might be over if Bitcoin closes in the low $60,000s. Additionally, according to Cowen, holding above $70,000‚Äì$73,000 would maintain the market's structure. Bitcoin may signal a macro lower high later in the year if it drops below this level, which could result in a more bearish outlook by Q3.

Bitcoin is still in a crucial consolidation phase, with its current price at $82,900 at the time of press. If past trends hold, this reset could pave the way for another strong rally in the coming months.
