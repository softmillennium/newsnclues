Oops, something went wrong

Elon Musk and Sam Altman finally found a common area of agreement — that a trial to settle their differences over the future of ChatGPT creator OpenAI should begin in December.

The proposal came in a joint court filing on Friday from Musk, Altman, OpenAI, and other named defendants, including Microsoft (MSFT). They asked for a two-week trial beginning Dec. 8.

A judge has ultimate discretion over whether to grant the joint request, though the California federal district court judge overseeing this case, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, is likely to agree on a date that both sides want.

The expedited battle is intended to weigh Musk's claims that Altman and OpenAI breached various agreements by planning to convert the artificial intelligence startup into a for-profit enterprise. He tried and failed to get a judge to approve an immediate injunction stopping the conversion.

Musk helped co-found OpenAI with Altman in 2015 by donating $45 million to the startup, which Musk claims was contingent on OpenAI remaining a nonprofit organization.

Musk parted ways over disagreements regarding how to move forward with the venture. He started a competing AI company called xAI. Musk alleges that allowing OpenAI to continue pursuing for-profit status would cause "irreparable harm" to Musk, xAI, investors, and the public.

Gonzalez Rogers, the judge overseeing this case, has made it clear she wants at least part of the dispute to go to trial.

“Something is going to trial in this case,” she told lawyers for Musk, OpenAI, and Microsoft in January.

On March 4, she even proposed an expedited trial for the "fall of 2025." The judge carved out some claims in Musk's lawsuit that likely won't go to trial until 2027 or 2028, including allegations that the defendants violated antitrust laws and that Altman violated laws prohibiting self-dealing.

Musk and Altman both told the judge they were in favor of a trial on the expedited claims in December. But that's where their agreement ends.

The parties disputed which of Musk's claims should go forward in the expedited trial and asked the judge to clarify. OpenAI also asked the judge to specify which claims remained open to defendant challenges.

According to Musk, the court should include his claim that OpenAI breached its duties as a charitable trust and its duty to operate in good faith, along with three claims alleging OpenAI entered into and violated a contract with Musk to remain a nonprofit.

According to Musk, Altman also breached laws against unfair competition by communicating a "fund no competitors" edict to OpenAI's current and prospective investors and permitting interlocking board positions between OpenAI and Microsoft.

OpenAI and the defendants deny those claims.

OpenAI asked the judge to include a broader set of Musk's claims, requesting that the trial also address his allegations of fraud, false advertising, breach of fiduciary duty, and civil racketeering violations.

Microsoft said it took no position on the scope of the expedited proceedings or the proposed case schedule but that it would ask to participate if claims against it were included in the December trial.

Microsoft also noted that the company requested a dismissal of all Musk's claims against it and that the court had yet to resolve its request.

The defendants have called Musk's allegations "false" and claimed he has no legal basis for blocking OpenAI's for-profit conversion.

Altman claims Musk wanted to fold OpenAI into his for-profit electric vehicle company, Tesla (TSLA), so that Tesla could provide it with additional funding.

Musk and a group of investors have since offered to purchase OpenAI for $97 billion. Gonzalez Rogers said in her ruling that the offer cut against Musk's claim that OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit business would cause Musk irreparable harm.

Musk named LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Microsoft executive Dee Templeton as defendants, claiming they illegally served as directors of both OpenAI and Microsoft at a time when the two companies were competing in the AI market.

Hoffman has since resigned from the nonprofit's board. Templeton is a nonvoting observer.

"I have significant concerns with Microsoft having put two members or two people on the board," Gonzales Rogers has said. "Whether or not they were voting — they were still information-sharing."

While Gonzales Rogers said some of Musk's claims would be fast-tracked for trial, she denied his request for an injunction that would have temporarily blocked the defendants from carrying out plans to turn the artificial intelligence charity into a for-profit business — and from transferring any material assets owned by OpenAI or its subsidiaries, including intellectual property.

As of October 2024, Microsoft had poured $13.75 billion into OpenAI.

A liquidation plan at Canada's oldest company could begin at all of its locations as soon as Tuesday and last for up to 12 weeks, but Hudson's Bay is still holding out hope that it will find a lifeline.

Lawyers for the beleaguered retailer said in an Ontario court Monday morning that if approved by the judge, the liquidation would span 80 stores as well as three Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks Off 5th locations in Canada that it owns through a licensing agreement.

The process Hudson's Bay is proposing would allow the retailer to remove some stores from the liquidation, should it find sufficient financing during the 10 to 12 weeks when lawyer Ashley Taylor expects the company to offload its inventory.

"A quick start will maximize the value of the business ... and preserve whatever chance there is of a restructuring," Taylor told Ontario Superior Court Judge Peter Osborne in a hearing at a Toronto courtroom Monday.

Hudson's Bay plans to liquidate business, close all stores

The hearing attracted so many lawyers, media and other observers that an overflow room had to be opened to facilitate spectators there to learn what will come of the retailer dating back to 1670, when the country was involved with the fur trade.

The hearing was meant to advance a creditor protection case Hudson's Bay launched March 7, when it admitted it was struggling with financial difficulties amid subdued consumer spending, Canada-U.S. trade tensions and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.

It said the situation has become so bad that it deferred some payments to landlords, service providers and vendors and was days away from not being able to meet payroll obligations.

As it struggled, a landlord "unlawfully locked" Hudson's Bay out of a store located in Sydney, N.S., and a team of bailiffs attempted to seize merchandise from a location it runs in Toronto, Ont., mall Sherway Gardens, said Jennifer Bewley, the chief financial officer for Hudson's Bay's parent company, in a court filing.

When the company filed for creditor protection, Hudson's Bay lawyer Taylor said the retailer's plan was to restructure by liquidating half its stores and monetizing some of the leases it tends to hold in prime, high-traffic spaces.

That plan was to be carried out under debtor-in-possession financing, which lenders make available to troubled companies in order to help them restructure.

In the run-up to the March 7 court hearing, Taylor said the company had two lenders interested in supplying that funding. But three hours before, the financing from its chosen suitor "fell apart" and the retailer "scrambled" to get an alternative together.

That alternative came in the form of $16 million in funding commitments from U.S.-based investment management firm Restore Capital and other lenders, expanded to $23 million soon after.

Despite the boost, the commitments weren't enough to satisfy all of Hudson's Bay's needs, forcing the company to "double" its efforts to find more cash, Taylor said.

It's since reached out to at least 19 potential lenders and major landlords who could offer rent concessions.

"To date, the company's efforts have failed," Taylor said in court Monday as he described why the company needed to pursue liquidation.

The liquidation Hudson's Bay is seeking will span the company's entire footprint, with Ontario taking the bulk of the hit because it's where the company has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work. B.C. hosts 16 locations; Alberta and Quebec each have 13; and Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have two per province.

Saks Fifth Avenue's Canadian sites are split between Ontario and Alberta and Saks Off 5th has stores in Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba.

Liquidating its entire business would put more than 9,000 jobs at risk.

Elizabeth Pillon, another lawyer who appeared on Hudson's Bay's behalf, said the company has about $315 million in inventory on its balance sheet right now and the proposed liquidation will extend to its e-commerce business, which will continue until the company's Scarborough, Ont., distribution centre empties.

The company plans to stop accepting gift cards after April 6 and has already paused its loyalty program, with more than 8.2 million Canadian customers holding about $58.5 million in unused points.

Hudson's Bay is also seeking permission to launch a process to find a buyer for some or all of its properties or the business.

The process would allow potential buyers to make a bid for some of the company's leases or just intellectual property, like Hudson's Bay's branding or rights to its famed stripe trademarks.

The company will also keep seeking financing. But some experts say finding a backer will be no easy feat for a business that has struggled with even "simple" matters like keeping escalators working.

"It is a major challenge and no doubt with some large strings attached," said Lanita Layton, a luxury and retail consultant and a former Holt Renfrew vice-president, in an email.

"Depending on who, if anyone does bring the financing, I don't foresee HBC continuing in the same format."

She says Hudson's Bay's most logical path forward will be shrinking the company to a "manageable size" by operating a smaller number of stores more "conducive to today's customer desires," which include a unique product mix, experiential opportunities, exciting visuals and great customer service.

"This marks the end of a nearly 400-year-old institution which is going to have significant impacts in reshaping the Canadian retail landscape, with major consequences for employees, customers, as well as broader retailers operating in Canada," said Jenna Jacobson, director of the Retail Leadership Institute at Toronto Metropolitan University.

This could be a real challenge for malls as large department stores act as the anchors in a lot of malls and also act as the driver to bring in consumers, she said.

"Filling that space is very challenging, because what retailer is able to take over that amount of space."

Hudson's Bay Company, in its original form, was founded by fur traders and owned a vast tract of northern Canada around Hudson Bay where it operated a far-flung chain of trading posts.

Dating back to 1670, it has been deeply entrenched in Canadian history, but has been led by Americans for several decades now.

The architect behind most of the Bay's modern history is Richard Baker, an American real estate titan whose National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought the company in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.

Baker took it public in 2012, only to reverse course through a takeover bid that had to be sweetened twice before shareholders accepted it in early 2020, ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Flagging global sales and Elon Musk's increasingly outspoken political activities are combining to rock the value of Tesla.

Shares in the once-trillion-dollar company saw their worst day in five years this week. Year to date, Tesla's stock has plunged 41% — though it is still up by about 36% over the past 12 months.

On Monday, the stock was down another 5%. 

For Musk, Tesla's shares remain his primary source of paper wealth, though he has also turned his stake in SpaceX into a personal lending tool. But it was proceeds from selling Tesla shares that helped Musk complete his acquisition of Twitter, now known as X.

Musk's wealth also allowed him to help vault Donald Trump into a second presidential term. Even as Musk's net worth has diminished as a result of Tesla's recent share-price declines, data suggests he is in no danger of losing his title as the world's wealthiest person.

Musk has said on X that he is not concerned about Tesla's recent drop in value. Still, evidence suggests the company is entering a period of transition.

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Musk's wealth has propelled him to a global presence that lacks precedent — and has polarized world opinion about the tech entrepreneur in the process. Any weakening of his financial position, therefore, could undercut his influence in the political and tech spaces where he now commands outsize attention.According to Bank of America, Tesla's European sales plummeted by about 50% in January compared with the same month a year prior.

Some say this is attributable to a growing distaste for Musk, who has begun dabbling in the continent's politics in the wake of his successful support of Trump's candidacy last year.

Others note Tesla's European market is facing increased competition from the Chinese electric-vehicle maker BYD, which has telegraphed ambitious plans for expansion on the continent.  

A more decisive blow to Tesla's near-term fortunes may be emanating from China itself. There, Tesla's shipments plunged 49% in February from a year earlier, to just 30,688 vehicles, according to official data cited by Bloomberg News. That's the lowest monthly figure registered since July 2022 — amid the throes of Covid-19 — when it shipped just 28,217 EVs, Bloomberg said.

Tesla is now facing intense competition from other Chinese EV makers, including BYD.

Yet even there, a Chinese official also warned about the impact of Musk's high-profile politicking.

“As a successful businessman, one should be embracing 100% of the market: Treat everyone nicely, and everyone will be nice in return,” the secretary of China's Passenger Car Association, said in a briefing Monday, Bloomberg reported. “But if you look at it in terms of voting, then half of voters will be friendly to you and half of them won't be.”

“This is the unavoidable risk that's come after he got his personal glory,” the secretary, Cui Dongshu, said Monday, referring to Musk.

On Friday, Reuters reported Tesla was planning to sell a Model Y costing at least 20% less to produce to defend its China share.

And in the U.S., Tesla's January sales were down about 11%, according to data from the S&P Global analytics group — an outlier at a time when EV sales for all other brands are trending higher in America.

Though he has long worn multiple proverbial hats, Musk's role in the White House as nominal head of the Department of Government Efficiency may be his most consequential. And having influence with the Trump administration could be critical to Tesla's fortunes. This week, Trump promised he would purchase a Tesla in a showy presentation on the White House lawn, seemingly further cementing the Trump-Musk alliance.

On X — the social media platform he owns — Musk's frenetic posting is increasingly focused on politics and America's culture wars, with an occasional nod to SpaceX launches.

His apparently undiminished role in the Trump administration — he was seen leaving the White House last weekend alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — has sparked boycotts in Europe, as well as protests and even acts of vandalism against auto owners in the U.S.

“When people's cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent to Musk might think twice about buying a Tesla,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, told CNBC's “Squawk on the Street” on Monday.

In a note to clients this week downgrading its estimate of deliveries, analysts with JPMorgan said the damage to Tesla's brand has been serious.

“We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” they wrote.

Tesla itself is warning about the fallout from retaliatory measures taken by countries targeted by Trump's tariffs, saying in a letter to the U.S. trade representative this week that the company may be “exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions.”

Already, the Canadian province of British Columbia has announced it was ending subsidies for Tesla's products.

For all the oxygen Musk has taken up with his political activities, concerns about Tesla products themselves are equally keeping investors and analysts up at night.

Musk has “neglect[ed] the rest of Tesla's automotive business as he thought that by the end of every year for the last 6 years, Tesla would be able to flip a switch and make all its vehicles self-driving — automatically increasing their value and making them infinitely more competitive than other vehicles,” Fred Lambert, who covers the company for the Electrek electric vehicle blog, wrote in a recent post.

Meanwhile, Musk decided to kill Tesla's cheaper, $25,000 model while going all-in on the Cybertruck, whose sales have yet to take off, Lambert said.

“Tesla's core business remains selling cars and batteries,” he wrote. “There's no doubt that the business of selling cars is not going well for Tesla right now, and under Musk, there's no clear path to improvement.”

By contrast, many analysts continue to take a much longer view of Tesla's outlook. In his most recent note to clients about the company, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, one of the most closely watched observers of Tesla, summarized the long-term outlook that he says continues to justify the company's eye-watering valuation.

“Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive ‘pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,” he wrote in a note March 2.

While that was before the most recent sell-off intensified, Jonas said he was already discounting market gyrations.

“While the journey may be volatile and non-linear, we believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage,” he wrote.

Seed Golf is marking St Patrick's Day [March 17] with the launch of ‘The Craic', a limited-edition variant of its signature SD-01 golf ball that celebrates the Irish brand's heritage.

Embellished with the image of a traditional Irish pint of stout, the ball headlines a full product range that also includes ‘Craic' ball markers, a divot repair tool, a cap, towel and umbrellas. Each item can be bought individually or as part of ‘The Craic Pack', priced at £75 on Seed's online store.

‘Craic' is an Irish slang term for a fun, lively time spent in good company – the essence of Seed's golfing philosophy. The brand was founded in Ireland, and the country remains Seed's home as it expands to all corners of the globe.

Known as ‘The Pro One', the SD-01 is Seed's first and best-selling ball, launching alongside the company in 2017. Now in its third iteration, the SD-01 is a three-piece Tour construction ball with an ultra-thin urethane cover and can fly up to 306 yards.

Dean Klatt, founder and CEO of Seed Golf, said: “We wanted the Craic range to be a celebration of not only St. Patrick's Day but Ireland itself – the place that will always be Seed's home even as we expand operations to more countries than ever before.

“As well as the SD-01, which is our flagship ball for a good reason, we've given nearly all of our non-ball products the Craic treatment – so even if all your Craic balls eventually end up in a lake somewhere you can have something from the range in your golf bag for a long time.”

All of Seed's balls can be purchased in individual boxes or via an online subscription-based service.

At the start of 2025, Seed announced a major ramp-up of global operations, including new distribution channels in the United States and Australia.

Canadian tariffs push costs up while Trump's tariffs push demand down — Desjardins

Expect to pay more for everything from new cars to your weekly grocery shop as the tariff war between Canada and the United States squeezes some businesses at both ends, economists warn.

So far U.S. President Donald Trump has put tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and threatened more to come on April 2. In retaliation, Canada has slapped duties on about $60 billion worth of U.S. goods and threatened them on another $100 billion.

Trump's tariffs will have the biggest impact on the economy, said Florence Jean-Jacobs, principal economist at Desjardins Group, but there will also be negative repercussions from Canada's counter tariffs and a weaker Canadian dollar for businesses who import materials from the United States.

“Some industries are caught between a rock and a hard place, risking a drop in U.S. demand for their products and an increase in their supply costs if substitutes are not easily found,” she wrote in her report.

The hardest hit sectors will be food manufacturing, machinery, plastics, chemical, automobiles, aerospace, wholesale trade and livestock and crop production.

Take, for example, a food manufacturer in Canada who exports to the United States. They would have to pay more to import grains, fruits and other raw materials from the U.S. to make their product because of Canadian tariffs, only to see sales fall south of the border because U.S. tariffs make them more expensive.

Even sectors that are considered resilient to Trump's direct tariffs such as construction, retail and food services will face higher costs because of Canada's retaliatory duties and a weak Canadian dollar.

Canada's construction industry will pay more for products it buys from the U.S. that range from heating and air conditioning equipment to furniture and cabinets to electrical and plumbing fixtures.

Auto wholesalers and dealers will pay more for cars imported from the U.S. as will retailers of clothing, food and beverages, pharmaceuticals and medical suppliers, said the Desjardins report.

“We can therefore expect consumers to pay higher prices for cars and parts imported from the United States and for food purchases that are hard to replace with Canadian or overseas products at equivalent cost,” said Jean-Jacobs.

The low loonie could also raise the price of gas, especially in eastern Canada where refineries are not set up to handle Western Canada's heavy oil and rely on imports from the United States.

The squeeze at both ends could lead to liquidity challenges for some companies, said the economist.

“They will have to choose between reducing their profits or increasing their selling prices, which will weaken their power to retain and attract customers already burned by the record-high inflation that followed the pandemic.”

The challenge will be especially difficult for low-margin businesses.

“Car dealerships and grocery stores, in particular, have some of the lowest margins among non-financial industries in Canada. Since Canada's counter-tariffs particularly target food and automobiles, these businesses could face significant challenges,” she said.

Jean-Jacobs said government support in reducing Canada's internal trade barriers, increasing productivity and exploring alternative markets will all help, “but companies will need to be proactive and invest to build their resilience against what's shaping up to be four years of uncertainty and volatility.”

How much do Trump's 25 per-cent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports matter to Canada? These sectors are highly dependent on the U.S. market, but in the big picture make up only 6 per cent of Canada's total merchandise exports.

The regional impact, however, is significant, in particular to Ontario and Quebec, said TD Economics' Maria Solovieva. Ontario produces most of the steel exports to the U.S. and Quebec the aluminum.

Quebec isn't just the biggest aluminum producer in Canada, it's the biggest on the continent and ranks fourth in the world behind China, India, and Russia.

If you're thinking of starting a new business and need advice on what to do, your first move should be turning to an artificial intelligence chatbot tool, like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude.

That's according to Steve Blank, who has written four books on the subject of entrepreneurship. He helped build eight different tech startups, of which he co-founded four, before retiring over two decades ago. His final startup, business software company Epiphany, sold to SSA Global Technologies for $329 million in 2005.

Blank is currently an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where he teaches courses on innovation and his Lean Startup method.

For years, Steve Blank has advised students and the founders he advises to "get the heck outside" of the office or classroom to talk to actual potential customers and find out what it is they want and build their prospective businesses accordingly. Now, he says, AI's generative tech can make that process even more effective.

"AI [is] a force multiplier to everything you do," Blank tells CNBC Make It. "AI could help you figure out where to get outside, probably faster than anything else. If you have a business idea, [ask] something like ChatGPT: 'I have Idea X, has anybody done it? Why hasn't [it] worked? Where should I best do this?'"

In addition to summarizing market research and offering feedback, some AI chatbots can write you a whole business plan. That free feature in ChatGPT, as well as in other platforms like Grammarly and Canva, can help give you a significant boost without the need to pay thousands of dollars for a freelance business consultant, Blank says.

"Just imagine you have Steve Blank over your shoulder, helping you ask these questions," says Blank. With AI, "you have at your fingertips a pretty good consultant [who] in the past would have charged you $10,000."

Though they have made rapid advances in recent years, AI tools are still far from foolproof. Their responses frequently include errors known as "hallucinations." Blank advises that anyone turning to AI for a business plan take recommendations with a grain of salt.

"Somewhere between 10% and 50% of their answers are bullshit, sure. And the problem is you don't know which ones," Blank says. One 2023 study from AI startup Vectara found that chatbots hallucinate as much as 27% of the time, while a recent BBC study found that roughly half of AI assistants' answers to news-related questions contained errors.

Even if they're far from perfect, though, Blank argues that these tools still have plenty of value, particularly for first-time entrepreneurs who want to move forward with a business idea and aren't entirely sure what steps to take. He compares getting business feedback from AI tools to "having a pretty smart friend who's kind of riffing." Maybe every single suggestion they have isn't brilliant, but they could give you some good starting points you might not have thought of on your own.

"If you take everything at face value, you might drive over the cliff, but they're giving you some great ideas to think about, particularly if you've really never done this before," Blank says.

Feed a few simple initial questions into an AI tool, he suggests: The answers generated can help give you some clarity about whether there is a legitimate "product-market fit" for your idea. For example:

AI-generated insights should never be a stand-in for boots-on-the-ground research, Blank says — putting in that work remains essential for any entrepreneur mapping out a new business. The crux of the "lean startup" method Blank has taught for decades is speaking with a cross-section of potential customers and clients as early in the ideation process as possible, and then using their feedback to determine the viability of any concept.

AI still "doesn't eliminate the need for getting out and testing the fundamental assumptions," Blank says. "Whether it's a restaurant or a consulting business or gardening store or whatever, you have a set of assumptions. The most important one is: 'Well, who are my customers?' And the second one is: 'What do they want?'"

Answering those questions before moving ahead with a business idea is essential, because they speak to the fundamental focus and strength of any potential business, Blank says. Not doing so is a major mistake that can doom a new company before it launches.

That said, prospective business owners who are unwilling to use AI tools put themselves at a distinct disadvantage, too, Blank says.

"You don't want to compete with someone who has an AI at their shoulder, because they're acting like they have a team of 20 people coaching them," says Blank. In addition to testing the hypothesis of a business idea, after all, AI assistants can help overwhelmed founders handle aspects of their business' finances, administrative tasks and web design.

"If you don't want to use it as a tool," fine, Blank says. "No one is going to stop you not wanting to succeed."

Bruce Andrews and Connor Bernard from mid-market aviation and defence M&A specialists Alderman & Company, advises company owners to embrace the space race

With the world growing ever more interconnected on a daily basis, satellite internet has quickly emerged from being a niche technology into being a global communication, defence, and business mainstay.

As data multiplies and efforts are made to bridge the divide between the offline and online population, players like SpaceX's Starlink and Blue Origin's Project Kuiper have emerged as the primary players in the field.

But as the reliance on satellite-based connectivity grows, it is more and more clear that a single controlling force could stifle innovation, raise prices, and even threaten national security.

This article explores the situation now, highlights Starlink's controlling position and Blue Origin's status and argues for why robust competition needs to be maintained in order to safeguard the future of satellite internet.

In order for direct-to-consumer high speed/high quality internet to be deployed worldwide there are two significant challenges.

The first challenge is the design and manufacture of thousands of small affordable technically sophisticated satellites combined with ground-based sender/receiver routers (so-called “Dishy” by Starlink) to permit direct to consumer internet reception.

The second challenge is to deploy the thousands of satellites into their respective orbits to create the satellite constellation. Clearly, Starlink has had the advantage in deployment thanks to the incredible success of SpaceX and the Falcon series of rockets.

Starlink has quickly become a synonym for satellite internet innovation. The company's aggressive deployment plan has resulted in a constellation of over 7,000 satellites in low Earth orbit and expansion plans for worldwide internet access with 42,000 satellites.

This large network already has offered real-world service to rural and underserved areas, revolutionising access to high-speed internet where the traditional infrastructure is not present.

Starlink's success extends past consumer markets; its technology has attracted significant government interest. Especially noteworthy are the Department of Defense contracts valued at approximately $733 million.

These highlights not only refer to first to market advantage but also to iterative improvements that have positioned Starlink as the industry standard-bearer.

The company's commitment to bringing people closer together all over the world is also reflected in its continuing innovation and swift growth, keeping even the remotest part of the world connected.

While Starlink has been going at an enormous speed, Project Kuiper of Blue Origin has encountered a succession of setbacks that have kept it from deployable success.

Delays in securing reliable launch vehicles, including United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur and Blue Origin's own New Glenn rocket, have significantly pushed back its deployment schedule.

Additionally, the project has faced manufacturing and regulatory challenges, compressing the timeline to meet FCC requirements that mandate at least half of its planned 3,236-satellite constellation be deployed by mid-2026.

These logistical hurdles have further postponed Project Kuiper's ability to begin providing commercial service, creating a widening gap between it and Starlink.

While Blue Origin remains committed to the initiative, the disparity in execution underscores how difficult it is to compete with Starlink's first-mover advantage and aggressive rollout strategy.

Project Kuiper's plans to manufacture satellites were initially envisioned for the first half of 2024 at a rate of five satellites per day but start-up issues delayed rate production to the end of 2024. Beta trials with paying users are envisioned in 2025.

Delays are indicative of the historic-sized issues with satellite mass production, management of complex supply chains, and transition from development to operation on a large scale.

As opposed to Starlink, with its enormous real-world experience, Project Kuiper is just starting to demonstrate viability at commercial levels.

That delay in practical experience not only postpones Blue Origin's market entry but also weakens its position in a rapidly evolving industry.

Competing against an established leader like Starlink, which continuously refines its technology and expands its reach, makes catching up increasingly difficult.

A future where Starlink dominates satellite internet poses risks, as a single company controlling such critical infrastructure could dictate pricing, limit service availability, and slow innovation.

Additionally, governments and industries relying on satellite connectivity may become overly dependent on one provider, creating economic and security vulnerabilities.

There is, however, significant good news and major progress achieved by Project Kuiper in recent months. Project Kuiper's new satellite manufacturing facility in Kirkland, Washington has been completed and is successfully producing higher satellite volumes.

Project Kuiper is also near completion of a satellite support facility on site at Cape Canaveral.

This facility is designed to complete system integration, perform satellite maintenance, and store completed satellites in preparation for charging its launch vehicles.

Significantly, Project Kuiper has also secured 83 launch reservations from its own Blue Origin rockets, United Launch Alliance, Arianespace, and from SpaceX, its direct competitor.

Thus, Project Kuiper is on the cusp of success having overcome the two key challenges of volume manufacturing and launch capacity.

Project Kuiper should be in the competitively challenging position of its goal of creating its own satellite constellation of 3,236 satellites in three orbital planes by the 2026/2027 timeframe.

With new entrants such as Amazon's Project Kuiper and other potential start-ups, a more dynamic and resilient market awaits.

These companies may well offer alternative technologies, new service models, and diverse approaches to global connectivity.

In a multi-firm market, consumers benefit from competitive pricing, improved service quality, and accelerated innovation.

A diversified industry also reduces reliance on a single provider, enhancing security and reliability.

While SpaceX's Starlink leads with services in over 100 countries, competition drives advancements and prevents monopolistic control over critical infrastructure.

The satellite internet industry is at a crossroads—though Starlink's success is significant, long-term sustainability depends on creating and maintaining a competitive market.

Having multiple competitors will lead to innovation and lower prices while also assuring that the network is more resistant to attacks from single points of failure.

With global demand for connectivity increasing relentlessly, it is not merely a question of economic efficiency to level the playing field for all contestants—it is a matter of strategy.

Opening ourselves to competition now is a gateway to a healthier, more dynamic, and safer satellite internet world tomorrow.

As specialists in the selling of middle market aerospace and defense companies, we believe that it is advisable for company owners to ensure they participate in those companies and technologies that support the growing space sector.

The sector is not only rapidly expanding but contains many areas in which to participate from launch vehicles to payloads to Space Infrastructure projects (e.g., debris detection and removal, ground support equipment, communication equipment, etc.).

We strongly encourage embracing the space sector for future growth and success.

      America's biggest retailers are deploying every weapon they have to navigate President Trump's fast-escalating trade war, from leaning on suppliers for discounts to finding alternate product sources. In some cases, that includes price increases for consumers.


     
      Much of the action so far has focused on goods from China, which the Trump administration hit with a 10% tariff in February and another 10% in March. Some suppliers say Walmart, Home Depot and other retailers are pushing a variation of the same demand: Make a price concession or shift production out of China. Otherwise, the suppliers risk losing some business.


     
      The sometimes-tense deliberations among retailers and suppliers show how Trump's trade agenda is already rippling through global supply chains, with billions of dollars of consumer spending at stake.


     
      “Companies are completely under the gun and panicking," said Joe Jurken, founder of the ABC Group in Milwaukee, which helps U.S. businesses manage supply chains in Asia. He has received a flood of inquiries from manufacturers facing pressure from retailers to move production out of China, he said.


     
      Some of the requests have raised the ire of Chinese officials. Authorities in China summoned Walmart for a meeting in recent days after some suppliers complained the largest U.S. retailer by annual revenue was pressuring them to cut prices and absorb the tariff cost.


     
      Walmart said it was in discussions with suppliers to help consumers save money and that it would continue to work closely with them “to find the best way forward during these uncertain times."


     
      Some pricing negotiations are hitting an impasse because many of these manufacturers are often already operating on razor-thin margins, according to suppliers. And retailers don't want to raise prices for shoppers so they can continue to compete for market share.


     
      William Liu, sales director for Rongli Garments, a Chinese manufacturer that makes seamless apparel, said that when the 10% tariff hit in February, his company agreed to lower prices by 5% for Walmart, though it cut into the garment maker's profit margins. After Trump imposed the additional 10% tariff, Walmart asked his company to raise the discount to 10%. Liu's company couldn't afford to absorb the cost and, as a result, Walmart is seeking new suppliers outside China, Liu said.


     
      Target, too, is talking to suppliers about how to share any additional costs, said Rick Gomez, chief commercial officer for the company. “Right now, a lot of those negotiations are going on."


     
      Some of the haggling has prompted more sourcing from outside of China. After the first 10% tariff on Chinese goods in February, Home Depot asked one of its U.S. suppliers of lighting and home decor to absorb the cost, according to an executive at the supplier. The supplier agreed to a two-month, 10% discount, part of which would be covered by its Chinese manufacturer.


     
      After the second 10% tariff in March, the supplier declined another request from Home Depot to lower prices again. Instead, the supplier is moving production to Southeast Asia so it can eventually charge the home-improvement retailer the original price, the executive said.


     
      A Home Depot spokeswoman said the company has been diversifying its sourcing for more than a decade. “We do this partnering with our vendors typically over several years," she said.


     
      The tariff planning is especially complicated because companies have little sense of which tariff threats will materialize and where new ones could emerge, retailers and suppliers say. Bouqs Co., an online flower company, learned that lesson soon after Trump took office and threatened a 25% tariff against goods imported from Colombia because of the country's initial refusal to accept repatriation flights from the U.S.


     
      That sent Bouqs executives into an emergency weekend meeting, during which they came up with a plan for Bouqs and its partners to share costs if tariffs emerge, Chief Executive Kim Tobman said. Farms in Colombia provide much of the cut flowers sold in the U.S. Bouqs sells goods directly to shoppers as well as inside Amazon.com's Whole Foods.


     
      “We had been thinking China," Tobman said. “There was no talk in our world about Colombia."


     
      Trump reversed course a few days later after Colombia accepted the repatriation flights. “It was a real shocker and stress for our team" and came just ahead of Valentine's Day, one of the industry's biggest sales days, she said.


     
      Now as the president threatens additional tariffs on a range of other trading partners, companies are worried about investing resources into moving production, only to potentially face duties on goods from those locations.


     
      “Choosing any other country other than the U.S. and thinking it's a safe haven is risky," said Kimberly Kirkendall, president of International Resource Development, an international supply-chain consulting firm that works with U.S. suppliers. “If your business is big enough and you've got the financial wherewithal to have multiple manufacturing sites, then that's the best strategy."


     
      In some cases, retailers and manufacturers have decided it is worth it to keep production in China to maintain quality. Costco, the warehouse chain, plans to continue selling patio furniture made in China—even at an elevated price—because it is higher quality than versions made in other countries, Costco executives said. Costco and its supplier will absorb some of the cost increase and pass some on to shoppers, they said.


     
      Prices on all goods affected by tariffs won't go up equally. Retailers create their tariff pricing strategies with the full assortment of goods consumers usually buy in mind. They might raise the price of clothing that shoppers are willing to pay more for, while keeping the price steady on another item shoppers are likely to buy frequently like bananas or paper towels.


     
      Merchants have to think through “pricing architecture," said Gomez, the Target executive. Target, for example, wants to continue selling some Christmas ornaments at $3, rather than raising the price.


     
      “That means we have to think about margin elsewhere. So maybe we will take pricing up a little bit on stockings," he said. “It's really not as simple as just flowing through cost."

          / CBS Minnesota
        

The inside of Odds & Ends Again in Arden Hills is like a trip back in time, with vintage toys, phonographs and classic art around every turn.    The thrift shop opened last month, after spending a dozen years down the street in Shoreview.    All was well for owner Brett Foss, until he received a letter from the city. Foss was told his shop had 14 days to leave its Lexington Avenue location.    Odds & Ends Again was in an area where thrift shops are not allowed, something Foss said he had no idea about.

"They were reaching out and saying 'hey, that's now allowed in this zoning,' even though we have Goodwill across the street in the same zoning," said Foss.

Last week, Foss went before Arden Hills City Council to make the case for his business.

"The business owner should have known," Arden Hill's Mayor David Grant said during the meeting. 

Grant said Foss was told about the city's zoning districts while previously inquiring about a different property in the city last year.

"It's a situation that was created by the owner of Odds & Ends Again," said Grant.

Foss could apply for a zoning change, but said it is too costly.

"I'm not wanting to give up on anything," said Foss.

In the meantime, hundreds have signed an in-store petition asking council to reconsider. That is just a fraction of the support, which is now in the thousands, even coming from outside Minnesota, Foss said.

"I never could have dreamt this could have come out of it," said Voss. "We're just trying to stay in business and be a local employer and give back to the community."

Grant said the council will decide on the issue during an April 14th work session.

Jason Rantala joined WCCO as a reporter in June 2023. He's a Minnesota native and is thrilled to be telling the stories of those in his hometown.
