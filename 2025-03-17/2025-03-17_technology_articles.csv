He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.

Google is shipping the latest ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù features of its Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model to more developers across all regions, and people are finding some concerning abilities that include editing out watermarks from photos.

The company‚Äôs lightweight localized on-device AI model is now equipped with native image generation that can not only produce pictures from a text prompt but also let you conversationally edit images. Over the weekend, users found that it can also remove watermarks with precision, TechCrunch reports.

Tools like Watermark Remover.io can already scrub marks from companies like Shutterstock, and a research team at Google built a watermark removal algorithm in 2017 to highlight the need for more secure protections. Conversely, some AI tools ‚Äî like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o ‚Äî will refuse requests to remove them.

Gemini 2.0 Flash, however, seems to be better than other options at removing complex watermarks like Getty Images stamps and filling in the image. After it removes the watermark, it will add a SynthID mark, effectively replacing a copyright mark with an ‚Äúedited with AI‚Äù one. But it‚Äôs possible to remove AI marks using AI, too, as we‚Äôve seen before with Samsung‚Äôs object erase tool.

Users also noted that Gemini 2.0 Flash could apparently add recognizable images of real people like Elon Musk into photos, something that the full Gemini model doesn‚Äôt allow.

Flash‚Äôs latest image features are only available for developers through AI Studio for now ‚Äî so its apparent lack of guardrails isn‚Äôt quite open for everyone to use (or abuse). We‚Äôve asked Google if there are protections in place to stop things like watermark removal but haven‚Äôt yet heard back.",techmeme

This includes licensed stock imagery found online, stamped with watermarks to indicate their copyrighted nature. This risks potential litigation from media licensing corporations. Limited testing on our end revealed that watermark removal was unsuccessful on several provided images, while the generation of celebrity images was possible.

Back in December, Google introduced native image output with Gemini 2.0 Flash for testing. Just last week, this update was made accessible across all regions, free of charge, and includes a slew of new features such as: telling a story with pictures, conversational image editing, world understanding, text rendering, and more. AI image generators have consistently faced scrutiny regarding ethical and moral considerations.

Companies like Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI typically integrate a set of guardrails or a list of dos and don'ts in their models to combat the misuse of their technologies. The restrictions stretch wide, but the general prohibitions typically include depictions of celebrities and notably the removal of watermarks from copyrighted material.

Recently, several Redditors found that Gemini's native image output feature extends to watermark removal from stock images, such as those from Getty Images, and celebrity image generation as well. In the first case, this probably violates multiple DMCA provisions as removing a watermark alters the CMI, which is information that identifies copyrighted work. The legality of generating celebrity images using AI is slightly more complex, primarily concerned over the protection of celebrities' rights of publicity and concerns surrounding deepfakes and potential defamation.

Even so, the removal of the watermark doesn't change the fact the image is likely protected by copyright law. So you can't expect to use these images commercially, as you'd probably be hit with a barrage of DMCA claims. In most cases, individuals may desire to remove the watermark, if said image is intended for personal use-cases.

Contrary to the Reddit thread, we were not able to remove watermarks from the same images, with Gemini responding, ""Unfortunately, I cannot directly edit images."" Conversational image editing works as intended in Google AI Studio, where Gemini managed to reproduce the image of a celebrity, so there's still some ironing out left to be done.

It's important to note that Google has tagged the image generation feature of Gemini 2.0 Flash as experimental. This may be why it's only available in Google AI Studio and not on Gemini's main site and could also explain these lapses in judgment.",techmeme

One of its abilities to remove watermarks from stock images is so impressive that Google might have to nerf it in order to avoid future legal action.

Social media is abuzz with Gemini 2.0 Flash's ability to remove watermarks from licensed work, a practice that is deemed illegal by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Such images litter stock photography services although in many cases, an identifying logo, text, or pattern is used to discourage unauthorized use. If you want the rights to an unaltered image without any watermarks, you will need to pay for a license.

Watermarks have been around in the digital imaging space for decades, and people have been erasing them for years. Originally, this was something that was done manually using an image editing program and could take a lot of time. Eventually, programs and online services emerged that automated the process although results could vary wildly.

Early examples of Gemini 2.0 Flash's capabilities shared online, however, are among the most impressive we have seen to date from an automated service. Not every instance is flawless, but many are very passable. Some are now wondering if they are too good, and if Google will end up removing the feature over fear that it might attract a lawsuit from a major player like Getty Images, which recently purchased rival stock media provider Shutterstock for $3.7 billion.

As TechCrunch highlights, others in the AI space have previously reached this fork in the road and acted on it. For example, OpenAI's GPT-4o and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet will flat out refuse to remove certain watermarks from images when asked.

The good news for Google is that it's still early days, and this version of Gemini 2.0 Flash is considered experimental. One would think that designation would give Google time to make any necessary changes without facing too much trouble in court.",techmeme

The AI model, praised for its advanced image processing, is now under scrutiny for facilitating the erasure of visual copyright protections, leaving creators and rights holders questioning Google‚Äôs approach to safeguarding content integrity.

Gemini‚Äôs Watermark Removal Skills

Demonstrations from users on platforms like Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) have shown that Gemini 2.0 Flash can not only erase watermarks but also generatively fill in the resulting gaps. The results, shared via screenshots and videos, depict images where the original watermark has been seamlessly replaced with AI-generated content.

The functionality, while technically advanced, raises pressing questions about copyright infringement. Removing watermarks from protected images, especially those from stock photo agencies like Getty Images, typically violates intellectual property laws unless under specific legal exceptions.

New skill unlocked: Gemini 2 Flash model is really awesome at removing watermarks in images! pic.twitter.com/6QIk0FlfCv ‚Äî Deedy (@deedydas) March 15, 2025

The ease with which Gemini performs this task has amplified fears that the tool could be used to bypass digital content protections, undermining the value and control of original creators.

Gemini 2.0 Flash is accessible through the Google AI Studio, allowing users to interact with and test its image processing capabilities. The platform‚Äôs flexibility has contributed to its popularity but has also opened concerns regarding misuse.

A Gap in AI Safeguards?

Despite growing concern, Google has yet to release an official statement addressing Gemini 2.0 Flash‚Äôs watermark removal capabilities.

This silence contrasts with the company‚Äôs stance on its Imagen 3 AI model, which incorporates SynthID‚Äîan invisible, cryptographic watermarking technology designed to ensure the authenticity of AI-generated images. SynthID embeds imperceptible digital markers that remain intact even after common image manipulations, helping creators and platforms verify content authenticity.

While SynthID‚Äôs implementation showcases Google‚Äôs broader commitment to responsible AI development, the discrepancy between its models has raised questions about consistency in applying ethical standards. Notably, SynthID itself has limitations, as researchers have shown that sophisticated watermarking techniques can be bypassed or altered without significantly degrading image quality.

Challenges of Watermarking and AI Misuse

The issue of watermarking is a persistent challenge in AI development. While SynthID offers advanced protection for AI-generated images, its assumed absence or insufficient implementation in Gemini 2.0 Flash leaves room for misuse. The model‚Äôs ability to remove watermarks and generatively fill gaps raises questions about the effectiveness of AI safeguards and Google‚Äôs strategy for preventing misuse across its AI products.

Other major AI players like OpenAI and Anthropic have explicitly programmed their models‚Äîsuch as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o‚Äîto reject requests to remove watermarks. These refusal mechanisms are designed to curb misuse and uphold ethical boundaries.

Legal Implications

The legal implications of watermark removal are considerable. Under U.S. copyright law, removing watermarks from copyrighted content without the owner‚Äôs consent is generally prohibited, barring rare exceptions.

Beyond legal considerations, the broader tech community is reacting with unease. Discussions on platforms like Reddit have highlighted not only Gemini‚Äôs technical prowess but also the ethical dilemmas it presents. As some users pointed out that while the AI effectively removes watermarks, the resulting images occasionally exhibit subtle alterations‚Äîsuch as color changes and unnatural textures‚Äîthat could undermine their authenticity.

The controversy over Gemini 2.0 Flash reflects the broader conversation about ethical AI development and corporate responsibility. As AI models become more advanced, the potential for misuse grows alongside the benefits they offer. While the ability to remove watermarks might support creative workflows in some scenarios, it also presents a serious risk to digital rights and content authenticity.

Ultimately, the issue is not just about one model‚Äôs capabilities but about how companies like Google address unintended uses of their technology. The absence of consistent safeguards across AI models highlights an urgent need for clearer guidelines and more robust protections.",techmeme

Digital watermarks on images enable digital creators to show a preview of their work before somebody decides to purchase it, at which point the watermarks are removed. AI tools that remove watermarks on images for free are nothing new but are deeply unethical, and can land you in legal hot water if you use the stolen images they create in any way.

Other users on X have noted that Gemini 2.0 Flash accessed via AI Studio can add celebrities into images, although in testing I found the results seem a little bit random, with Gemini often refusing the request.

The power of AI Studio

Google recently released a new version of its Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model that can generate its own images. This sounds slightly confusing when you realize that we‚Äôve all been able to go to gemini.google.com or fire up the Gemini app and ask it to create an AI image for well over a year now.

However, what the mobile app and browser-based versions of Gemini do is call upon Imagen 3, Google‚Äôs flagship AI image generator, to generate the image for them. Imagen 3 will not remove watermarks from images if asked.

Recently Google has enabled Gemini 2.0 Flash to create and modify images itself. You can‚Äôt access the image generation power of Google 2.0 Flash from the regular Gemini interface, instead you need to access it via Google‚Äôs AI Studio, a developer-focussed interface for interacting with its latest AI models.

Cause for concern

AI Studio is free to access and just requires a normal Google account for registration. To test it out I uploaded a watermarked image and was able to easily remove the watermark.

The results weren‚Äôt perfect - the image became slightly degraded and it added its own Gemini star logo to the bottom left corner, but what is especially concerning with the new Gemini 2.0 Flash watermark removal ability is how well it does it.

It‚Äôs clearly not the purpose that Gemini 2.0 Flash was created for, but the fact that Google hasn‚Äôt put sufficient guardrails in place with its image generator is a concerning development and something that needs addressing urgently.

The rise of generative AI has been a fairly messy process, especially from fair usage ethics and copyright perspective. AI giants are inking deals with publishers to avoid legal hassles, while at the same time, they are embroiled in copyright tussles in courts in multiple countries.

As the ravenous appetite for training AI on user data grows, we might be in for another ethical conundrum. Multiple users on X and Reddit have shared demonstrations of how Google‚Äôs latest Gemini 2.0 series AI model can remove watermarks from copyright-protected images.

The model in question is the Gemini 2.0 Flash, which was released earlier this year and got a reasoning upgrade, as well. It is worth noting here that you can not remove the watermark if you are using the mobile or desktop version of the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. Trying to do so returns a message like this:

‚ÄúRemoving watermarks from images without the explicit permission of the copyright holder is illegal in most countries. It is important to respect the copyright laws and intellectual property rights. If you want to use an image with a watermark, you should contact the copyright holder and ask for permission.‚Äù

You can, however, try and remove the watermark from images in the Google AI Studio. Digital Trends successfully removed watermarks from a variety of images using the Gemini 2.0 Flash (Image Generation) Experimental model. We strongly recommend that you don‚Äôt replicate these steps.

It is a violation of local copyright laws and any usage of AI-modified material without due consent could land you in legal trouble. Moreover, it is a deeply unethical act, which is also why artists and authors are fighting in court over companies using their work to train AI models without duly compensating them or seeking their explicit nod.

How are the results?

A notable aspect is that the images produced by the AI are fairly high quality. Not only is it removing the watermark artifacts, but also fills the gap with intelligent pixel-level reconstruction. In its current iteration, it works somewhat like the Magic Eraser feature available in the Google Photos app for smartphones.

Furthermore, if the input image is low quality, Gemini is not only wiping off the watermark details but also upscaling the overall picture. In my first attempt, the input image was 485 x 632 pixels, while the output picture was 783 x 1024 pixels.

The output image, however, has its own Gemini watermark, which itself can be removed with a simple crop. There are a few minor differences in the final image produced by Gemini after its watermark removal process, such as slightly different color temperatures and fuzzy surface details in photorealistic shots.

The degree of variation is not too deep, and any person with even basic skills in image editing can fix it and achieve results similar to the original copyright-protected image. Moreover, there are multiple third-party tools out there that can remove watermarks from AI-generated images, as well.

What is the policy?

In 2023, Google signed a pledge ‚Äî alongside fellow AI companies including Meta, Anthropic, Amazon, and OpenAI ‚Äî to implement a watermarking system in AI-generated material. The company made that commitment to the White House, as former President Joe Biden flagged risks such as deepfaked material.

Earlier this year, Google added a system called SynthID digital watermarking for all photos that have been touched up using the AI Reimagine tool in the Photos app. The watermark is not visible and can‚Äôt be seen by human eyes, but machines can detect and verify their AI origins. The tech was created by Google DeepMind.

Other AI companies have also taken an approach where they add AI disclosure to the metadata of images. Google will even show those details in Search. All that sounds like a fair disclosure move, but the implementation should be a two-way track.

I tried removing the watermark from the set of images with other AI models, but Anthropic‚Äôs Claude and OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT explicitly rejected the request, citing copyright laws and fair usage policies. Gemini, on the other hand, removed the watermarks and didn‚Äôt even provide a disclaimer or warning.

A bit of interesting history

Back in 2017, a team of Google researchers created an algorithm capable of removing stock and institutional watermarks from images. Their work, which essentially saw a pattern in watermarking habits, was detailed at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference.

‚ÄúWe revealed a loophole in the way visible watermarks are used, which allows to automatically remove them and recover the original images with high accuracy,‚Äù says the research paper. ‚ÄúThe attack exploits the coherency of the watermark across many images, and is not limited by the watermark‚Äôs complexity or its position in the images.‚Äù

The tool was tested on images belonging to well-known stock photography databases across a wide range of categories such as food, nature, and fashion. The whole multi-stage system relied on detection, matting, reconstruction, decomposition, and blend factoring techniques.

It is, however, worth noting that the algorithm was tested to highlight the flaws in existing watermarking practices prevalent in the industry. The idea was to stir a debate and improve watermark security. With Gemini, we are looking at a tool accessible to everyone without any coding or technical know-how required.

The road ahead

It goes without saying that removing watermarks from an image is a big no-no for a variety of reasons. Aside from violating local laws, it takes away from the hard work of artists and photographers, who are already facing an uphill battle because their material was used to train AI without their knowledge or paying them for it.

But it‚Äôs not just the court battles that are of concern. Generative AI tools are being adopted widely, at the cost of human workers losing their livelihoods. For example, Marvel used AI imagery to create the opening credits sequence for the Secret Invasion TV show.

Just over a month ago, Microsoft launched a tool called Muse AI that can generate gameplay clips. The company says Muse has been developed ‚Äúto effectively support human creatives,‚Äù but we can‚Äôt quite see the human appeal in the whole pitch.

We are not entirely sure whether Gemini removing watermarks from copyright-protected images is a bug. However, we do hope it‚Äôs a misstep and that the underlying image editing framework is fixed to ensure that it can even block workarounds.

According to reports doing rounds on social media, the model‚Äôs image generation feature ‚Äî rolled out last week as part of an expansion in Google‚Äôs developer-facing AI Studio ‚Äî can not only strip watermarks but also fill in the resulting gaps with surprising accuracy. While labeled ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù and ‚Äúnot for production use,‚Äù the tool‚Äôs lack of restrictions has raised ethical and legal concerns, especially since it‚Äôs free to access.

Social media platforms like X and Reddit have buzzed with user demonstrations of Gemini‚Äôs capabilities. One X user, George Arrowsmith, showcased the AI seamlessly erasing a watermark from a stock photo, while several Reddit threads praised its gap-filling prowess, though some noted its struggles with semi-transparent or sprawling watermarks. Unlike competitors such as Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3.7 Sonnet or OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o ‚Äî which explicitly refuse such tasks, with Claude labeling watermark removal ‚Äúunethical and potentially illegal‚Äù ‚Äî Gemini 2.0 Flash operates with few guardrails, amplifying its controversial appeal.

Under U.S. copyright law, removing watermarks without consent is generally illegal, barring rare exceptions, as outlined by legal experts. This has left copyright holders wary, especially given the tool‚Äôs potential to undermine protections for photographers, artists, and media companies. Google has yet to comment on the backlash, with inquiries sent outside normal business hours unanswered as of March 16, 2025.

This development echoes broader concerns about AI ethics that have surfaced in recent months. In late 2023, OpenAI faced scrutiny when its DALL-E 3 model was found generating near-exact replicas of copyrighted artwork, prompting lawsuits from artists alleging intellectual property theft. Similarly, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude was criticized for inadvertently producing biased outputs in text generation, raising questions about accountability in AI deployment. Midjourney has also faced criticism of its own, and so have social media platforms like Instagram. These incidents highlight a recurring theme: as AI tools grow more powerful, their developers struggle to balance innovation with responsibility.

Gemini‚Äôs watermark removal feature adds fuel to an already heated debate about AI‚Äôs role in creative industries. While some users celebrate the technology as a democratizing force, others see it as a threat to livelihoods dependent on copyright enforcement. The absence of robust restrictions in Gemini 2.0 Flash contrasts sharply with the cautious approaches of its rivals, positioning Google as an outlier in the race to define AI‚Äôs ethical boundaries.

For now, the feature remains accessible in Google‚Äôs experimental sandbox, but its implications could ripple far beyond. As AI continues to blur the lines between creation and appropriation, regulators and creators alike may demand stricter oversight. Whether Google will impose limits or double down on its permissive stance remains unclear ‚Äî but the conversation around AI‚Äôs power, and its pitfalls, is only growing louder.",techmeme

Users on social media have highlighted an interesting, but controversial use case of Google‚Äôs new Gemini AI model: culling watermarks from images, including images published by Getty Images and other renowned stock media portals, as per a Tech Crunch report.

The Gemini 2.0 Flash model appears to have precious few guardrails, and in addition to removing watermarks, it can generate images of famous personalities and copyrighted animated characters without any fuss. Case in point: an image of the world‚Äôs wealthiest person, Elon Musk, and a series of images of the famous Pokemon character Pikachu.

Notably, only last week, Google had expanded access to Gemini 2.0 Flash‚Äôs image generation feature.

Removing Watermarks: AI Models in Action

This particular feature is ‚Äòexperimental‚Äô and ‚Äònot for production use‚Äô as of now, and is only available for use on Google‚Äôs developer-facing tools like AI Studio.

And even though it appears to be immaculately skilled at removing watermarks and filling in any gaps that are left after a particular watermark is removed, it isn‚Äôt perfect at executing this job.

It apparently struggles with semi-transparent watermarks and those that cover a wide expanse of images.

On the other hand, AI models such as Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o expressly refuse to remove watermarks from images, with Claude even going as far as to call the act ‚Äúunethical and potentially illegal.‚Äù

Earlier in June last year, PicsArt partnered with Getty Images to generate copyright-free AI images. The partnership allows PicsArt‚Äôs new AI image generation tool to create images ‚Äúwith commercial rights and an indemnity,‚Äù. Here, PicsArts used licensed Getty Images to train its AI models.

Legal View On AI And Watermarks

Coming to the legal aspect of removing watermarks, the US copyright law outlaws doing away with a watermark sans the original owner‚Äôs consent, except for rare instances.

Elsewhere, the European Union‚Äôs AI Act‚Äòs Article 50 ‚Äì which lists out the obligations of AI providers and deployers of AI systems ‚Äì states that outputs of an AI system should be in a ‚Äúmachine-readable format‚Äù, and must be detectable as ‚Äúartificially generated or manipulated‚Äù.

Advertisements

Meanwhile, closer home, China has announced ‚Äòidentification measures‚Äô stipulating that AI-generated content should have human and machine-readable notifications. Even AI-generated files available for download must have labels so that users are aware about what they are going to access.

An important point to note here is that Chinese regulators likely drew inspiration from the EU‚Äôs AI Act, usually considered to be the most comprehensive legal framework aimed at regulating AI thus far.

‚ÄúChinese policymakers and scholars have said that they‚Äôve drawn on the EU‚Äôs Acts as inspiration for things in the past,‚Äù said Jeffrey Ding, an Assistant Professor of Political Science at George Washington University.

But as AI keeps on becoming sophisticated, it is the need of the hour for countries around the globe to amend existing laws or even bring in newer legislation that safeguards and ensures the rights and security of copyright holders.

Apparently, it is capable of removing watermarks from images, including those from Getty Images, Shutterstock, and other popular photo stocks. This was reported by TechCrunch.

Gemini 2.0 Flash causes copyright concerns

Last week, Google expanded access to the image creation feature in the Gemini 2.0 Flash model, which allows not only creating, but also editing graphic content. However, this feature seems to have weak protection against misuse.

Gemini 2.0 Flash does not hesitate to create images of celebrities and copyrighted characters and, as already mentioned, to remove watermarks.



Image by X user George Arrowsmith

As noted by X and Reddit users, the model not only removes watermarks, but also tries to fill the gaps left by the removal.

How people are doing it?

The process causes so much concern due to how easy it is to remove watermarks. All the user has to do is select Gemini 2.0 Flash (Image Generation) Experimental option in the model select, upload a picture to the chatbot and enter a prompt similar to ""remove watermark from image."" The AI responds to the request almost instantly.

However, it does not always do this correctly: it has difficulty with translucent marks and watermarks that cover a large part of the image. Below is an example where the word 'Getty' was replaced with 'Geck' during processing.

One of the most bitter rivalries in the world of H.R. service providers just took a turn that wouldn‚Äôt be out of place in a spy thriller.

Rippling on Monday sued Deel, accusing its competitor of hiring a mole in its Dublin office to comb through Rippling‚Äôs trade secrets, a scheme that reached its rival‚Äôs highest ranks, DealBook‚Äôs Michael de la Merced reports. Rippling said it had uncovered the defector through a ‚Äúhoneypot‚Äù trap ‚Äî a Slack channel set up specifically for the ruse that was mentioned in a letter to top Deel executives.

Establishing a Euro-stack would increase competition and innovation

EU companies want common standards and less red tape

Several major European tech companies are pushing for greater action from the European Union to reduce the bloc‚Äôs reliance on foreign-owned infrastructure by buying and building locally.

In an open letter to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the EU‚Äôs digital chief, Henna Virkkunen, around 100 organizations called for greater adoption of EU-grown apps, platforms, AI models, chips, computing, storage, and connectivity.

The move comes as the Trump administration seemingly positions itself to burn an 80 year relationship that the United States has held with Europe.

Developing the ‚ÄòEuro-stack‚Äô

The European digital sovereignty movement has been gradually gaining momentum over the past few years, but has seen a massive increase in support and traction following the re-election of President Trump. Companies such as Airbus, Element, OVHCloud, Murena, Nextcloud, and Proton have all put their mark on moving towards EU digital sovereignty.

A paper [PDF] published in January 2025 by a number of prominent business heads and tech experts has given some foresight to how a ‚ÄúEuro stack‚Äù would work: ‚ÄúThe objective is to reduce Europe‚Äôs current total dependency on non-European actors for service to European citizens, businesses, and institutions, to enhance security, create redundancy and resilience, improve opportunities for innovation and digital competitiveness while establishing European governance rules.‚Äù

Essentially, the European Union has become overly reliant on foreign-owned infrastructure - especially US Big Tech - and if nothing is done soon, EU countries will become subservient to foreign tech companies.

The solution therefore is to foster growth at home, with the letter stating, ‚ÄúIndustry will invest if there are adequate demand prospects. Prioritizing areas where Europe can already deliver will be key to shifting resources fast to European suppliers, creating value and market in a virtuous circle.‚Äù

In an open letter, around 80 organisations backed recommendations made by the EuroStack initiative to focus less on regulation and more on investment through creation of a sovereign infrastructure fund and requirements for the public sector to ‚Äúbuy European‚Äù.

They said: ‚ÄúEurope‚Äôs current multiple dependencies create security and reliability risks, compromise our sovereignty and hurt our growth. It has been clear for some time that Europe cannot regulate itself out of its laggard position. It needs to take proactive industrial action.‚Äù

Addressed to European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen and tech sovereignty EVP Henna Virkkunen, the letter called for a sovereign fund to invest in ‚Äúcapital-intensive parts of the value chain‚Äù such as quantum computing.

The group also said the EU should reassign funds under its Digital Decade Initiative with a focus on ‚Äútangible‚Äù result-oriented projects.

See also: Europe quietly kills off its AI Liability Directive

Matthew Hodgson, CEO of E2E messaging platform Element, a signatory of the letter, told The Stack the fund should ensure funding translated into ‚Äúreal-world adoption rather than fragmented pilots.‚Äù

He said: ‚ÄúThis is not just about competitiveness, it‚Äôs about security, autonomy and long-term sustainability in a world where digital infrastructure is as critical as energy and defense.

‚ÄúEurope has the talent and assets to lead, but it requires bold action, coordinated investment and a shift from dependency to digital self-determination.‚Äù

The letter highlights a growing concern in Europe that the early dominance of US and China in the AI sector could leave its own companies in the dust as the technology only grows its power.

In 2023 the seven largest US tech companies had a market value 20 times that of their EU counterparts, and not much has happened to indicate this may have changed.

The EuroStack initiative, which first published a report on its recommendations in January, said one way to combat the size of US companies was by adopting a ‚Äúpooling and federating‚Äù approach to sharing assets in an open source environment.

However, Amanda Brock, CEO of open source development non-profit OpenUK, told The Stack that this approach risked dampening innovation and warned government ‚Äúmust understand that tech and AI development needs to be collaborative.‚Äù

She said: ‚ÄúI am deeply concerned by all of these consequences of geo-political shifts driving the development of so-called ‚ÄòEuropean technology‚Äô.

In a letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sent on March 14, 2025, the EuroStack Initiative stresses that the continent can no longer afford to rely on non-European technologies.

This warning comes amid growing concerns about the economic and security risks tied to Europe‚Äôs dependence on American and Chinese tech giants.

Rethinking Europe‚Äôs Digital Strategy

The group, which includes major tech companies, industry associations, and civil society organizations, is calling for a drastic overhaul of Europe‚Äôs digital policy.

The core of their proposal is clear: Europe must reduce its reliance on foreign tech providers and invest in local solutions. ‚ÄúEurope cannot continue down the path of outsourcing its digital infrastructure to non-EU players,‚Äù the coalition declared.

They argue that it‚Äôs time for the EU to build its own digital technologies that serve both economic and strategic interests.

‚ÄúIt has been clear for some time that Europe cannot regulate itself out of its laggard position. It needs to take proactive industrial action: it has enormous talent, capabilities, assets and business record in the digital space, but the legacy of our structural fragmentation (as described

in the Draghi report) have led our Continent to fall significantly behind the US and China.

Even with the positive announcements at the Paris AI Action Summit, Europe will lose out on digital innovation and productivity growth without sweeping and urgent change ‚Äì our reliance on non-European technologies will become almost complete in less than three years at current rates.‚Äù

A key component of the coalition‚Äôs proposal is the establishment of a ‚ÄúBuy European‚Äù procurement policy, which would ensure that public sector spending supports European technology providers.

This policy would aim to create demand for European-made digital solutions and encourage local innovation. The push for local sourcing aligns with EuroStack‚Äôs goals, which focus on developing sovereign, scalable digital infrastructure to reduce dependency on non-EU technologies.

EuroStack emphasizes the creation of a competitive environment where European solutions are prioritized, leading to more sustainable growth in the digital sector.

Creating Conditions for Local Investment

The coalition is not just calling for a policy shift but for the creation of an investment ecosystem that can support this transition. The proposal for a Sovereign Infrastructure Fund is key in this regard.

This fund would facilitate public and private investment in critical digital infrastructure, particularly in sectors such as chip manufacturing and quantum computing, which require significant capital.

Without such investments, the coalition warns that Europe will remain at a disadvantage in the global race for digital dominance.

This fund would target high-risk, high-reward areas, with the aim of creating a robust and competitive European tech industry that can stand on its own.

‚ÄúWhat business needs is a pragmatic industrial policy strategy to reduce our dependencies in critical technologies, while focusing on selected initiatives to overcome Europe‚Äôs structural challenges ‚Äì fragmentation, suppression of local demand, focus on research rather than productization, lack of adequate capital ‚Äì to promote productivity growth and security. Not just funding of R&D initiatives, but supporting European industry to gain relevance in supplying European (and global) needs,‚Äù the coalition‚Äôs letter emphasizes.

The initiative reflects ealier recommendations of the EuroStack initiative, which advocates for pooling resources across industries to develop interoperable and scalable European digital solutions.

EuroStack has highlighted the need for coordinated efforts between the public and private sectors to ensure that Europe‚Äôs digital infrastructure is both secure and competitive on the global stage.

EuroStack Initiative: The Blueprint for Sovereign Digital Infrastructure

The EuroStack initiative, launched in early 2025, serves as the primary framework for the coalition‚Äôs vision of digital sovereignty. EuroStack aims to build a sovereign, end-to-end digital infrastructure that integrates everything from hardware to software solutions.

The ambitious initiative addresses Europe‚Äôs fragmented digital ecosystem by proposing a federated approach where resources from various industries are pooled together to create scalable, secure, and interoperable solutions.

According to the initiative‚Äôs vision, Europe must focus on building a robust digital stack‚Äîranging from data storage and cloud computing to higher-level applications such as AI and cybersecurity.

By doing so, Europe can reduce its reliance on foreign technologies, particularly in critical sectors that underpin national security and economic stability.

While EuroStack is focused on developing local infrastructure, it also remains open to collaboration with non-European companies. However, as the initiative stresses, the priority is ensuring that European companies can lead the development of digital solutions within Europe, establishing a foundation of self-reliance for the long term.

Addressing Security and Data Sovereignty Concerns

Digital sovereignty also has profound implications for Europe‚Äôs security. As the continent becomes more reliant on foreign cloud providers and AI platforms, concerns about data privacy and cybersecurity grow.

The coalition‚Äôs letter calls for stronger safeguards to protect European data and prevent foreign interference in critical sectors. One of the key proposals is the establishment of a certification scheme for sovereign cloud services that comply with European standards for data protection and cybersecurity.

The coalition argues that public and private sector organizations must have access to secure cloud services that meet Europe‚Äôs regulatory and security requirements, ensuring that Europe‚Äôs most sensitive data remains protected from external threats.

The emphasis on data sovereignty also reflects growing concerns about the influence of non-EU actors over Europe‚Äôs digital future.

As Europe faces increasing geopolitical risks, the coalition believes that developing sovereign cloud services and other essential infrastructure is necessary to ensure the continent‚Äôs security.

The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities

Achieving digital sovereignty will not be without its challenges. One of the main obstacles is the fragmented nature of Europe‚Äôs tech sector, which has made it difficult to create unified, large-scale solutions.

EuroStack‚Äôs proposal to pool resources from diverse industries aims to address this fragmentation and create a cohesive digital infrastructure that can support Europe‚Äôs future needs.

Another significant challenge is the need for sufficient financial resources. The Sovereign Infrastructure Fund, which would require substantial public and private investment, must be established to support the development of critical digital technologies.

The coalition argues that redirecting existing EU funds, such as those allocated under the Digital Decade initiative, could help ensure that Europe has the resources it needs to build a competitive digital economy.

Despite these challenges, the coalition remains confident that Europe can regain control over its digital future. By fostering investment in local tech solutions, creating demand through procurement policies, and prioritizing European-led infrastructure, the coalition believes that Europe can reduce its reliance on foreign technologies and ensure its digital sovereignty.",techmeme

Aerospace giant Airbus, cloud storage firm Cubbit and lobby groups such as the European AI Forum and the European Startup Network are among the 100 or so signatories of an open letter to European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen.

Signatories of the letter have called on the EU to create a sovereign infrastructure fund to galvanise investment in tech across the bloc, as part of a series of demands. The issue of European tech independence is a hot-button issue, as the bloc plays catch up to the US and China.

The issue has become more pronounced amid faltering relations between the US and EU after a broadside by US vice president JD Vance, who questioned European values. The 2024 Draghi report highlighted that the EU needs more coordinated industrial policy, more rapid decisions and massive investment if it wants to keep pace economically with the US and China.

The open letter says:

""Europe needs to recover the initiative and become more technologically independent across all layers of its critical digital infrastructure: from logical Infrastructure - applications, platforms, media, AI frameworks and models - to physical infrastructure - chips, computing, storage and connectivity. ""Europe‚Äôs current multiple dependencies create security and reliability risks, compromise our sovereignty and hurt our growth.""

It adds:

""We call on your convening powers to mobilise industry to actively help coordinate and validate a continent-wide strategy to power a European digital sovereign effort. ""To support Europe in this acute moment of crisis for our security and strategic autonomy, the Commission must urgently form and convene working groups with industry to transform its tech sovereignty ambition into concrete actions.""

As well as a call for an EU sovereign infrastructure fund, the letter also calls for the EU to prioritise services with strong adoption projects, such as those in cybersecurity and prioritising ‚Äúresult-oriented projects‚Äù.

Signatories of the letter back the EuroStack initiative, which is championing EU digital sovereignty and calling for Europe to play a bigger role in digital supply chains.

The letter adds:",techmeme

So, what will happen if Europe decides to go self-sufficient on the tech front and create its own ‚ÄúEuro Stack‚Äú? How will it affect both Europeans and other people around the world? Well, they say competition is good for everyone, and I‚Äôm inclined to agree. More European tech would mean more competition for American tech, and more competition means better products for consumers.

You might think there are more tech products out there than we could possibly need, but the reality is a little more complicated. Take search engines, for example ‚Äî we all know that Google and Bing are the most popular choices, but there are plenty of alternatives, right? Well, not really. Right now, just about every alternative search engine, from DuckDuckGo to Qwant, uses the search indexes from Google or Bing. This means that, if Google and Bing decided to stop sharing their search indexes, all of these alternative products would stop working.

Initiatives to build new, independent search indexes have started ‚Äî such as Brave Search or the new partnership between Qwant and Ecosia ‚Äî but building a search index is a big project and it will take a lot of time to get the quality of these new products to where Google and Bing are now.

There are plenty of other examples, too. All of the biggest map software apps are owned by big tech companies, as are most big AI models and LLM services, instant messaging apps, operating systems, browsers, social media platforms ‚Äî and a lot more. When buying a new PC, most consumers have to choose between Windows devices or macOS devices ‚Äî in other words, Microsoft or Apple.

For phones, it‚Äôs Android or iOS ‚Äî so Google or Apple. The main problems with current alternatives are that firstly, they‚Äôre too small. In most cases, you have to sacrifice functionality, features, and support to try out something new. Secondly, many are built on existing infrastructure from companies like Microsoft and Google.

The point is ‚Äî we don‚Äôt have enough choices. Availability, affordability, and convenience are always pushing us into the hands of American big tech companies. If the EU decides that its people and its organizations need to have access to homegrown alternatives ‚Äî you can bet those alternatives will be available worldwide. That means more tech for everyone, and with the strict data laws in the EU, we would finally have a choice between selling our data and not selling it (instead of the choice we have now, which is just deciding who to sell it to).",techmeme

I‚Äôm talking to Evan Smith, the cofounder and CEO of Altana, a company that makes software to track and manage the global supply chain.

Smith started Altana in 2019 because he predicted that the first wave of globalized manufacturing and free trade would come to an end, and companies would need powerful tools to adapt their supply chains as borders, tariffs, and tensions got more complicated. Here in 2025, that looks like it was a pretty good bet, even if the way it‚Äôs playing out is a little more stressful and chaotic than anyone really wants.

The easiest way to think about Altana‚Äôs product is that it‚Äôs a map of the global supply chain ‚Äî you‚Äôll hear us call it that several times in this conversation. What that means is that Smith has a front-row seat to how things like Trump‚Äôs tariffs and isolationist trade policy are playing out in real time. So while we talked about Altana as a company a little bit, we really spent our time talking about where things like the iPhone are made and where they might be made in the future.

Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge‚Äôs Nilay Patel about big ideas ‚Äî and other problems. Subscribe here!

You‚Äôll also hear us talk a lot about China and how the Trump administration is focused on reducing our dependency on Chinese manufacturing ‚Äî a goal that may or may not be possible on the kinds of timelines that matter to politicians, especially ones like Trump.

Smith has a lot of insight here, and he‚Äôs very even-keeled about what Altana‚Äôs map of the world is showing us about trade policy and conflict between major powers like the United States and China. There are some big, unsettling ideas here, but talking about them directly and with clarity at least made me feel like I had a framework to understand the endless on-again, off-again tariff news cycle.

Oh, two notes before we start. You‚Äôll hear us mention John Mearsheimer, who really was my international relations professor at the University of Chicago in the early 2000s. Mearsheimer is a famous proponent of what‚Äôs called realism, a philosophy that says great-power competition dominates world affairs.

The other note is that you‚Äôll hear us talking about China being granted membership in the World Trade Organization in 2001. That probably seems like a bit of trivia now, but it was a major political decision at the time ‚Äî a decision that you‚Äôll hear Smith characterize as the end of the first wave of globalization and the end of the post-WWII world order. You can certainly argue with that characterization, but it‚Äôs worth calling out because it was indeed a major, controversial decision at the time. There‚Äôs a lot in this one; I‚Äôm very eager to hear what you all think about it.

Okay: Altana CEO Evan Smith. Here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Evan Smith, you‚Äôre the co-founder and CEO of Altana. Welcome to Decoder.

Thank you for having me.

I am excited to talk to you. Altana builds software that helps people think about supply chains and logistics. There‚Äôs a lot to talk about there.

I was reading the company‚Äôs manifesto, which you wrote in 2022. You founded the company in 2019 on the thesis that globalization as we knew it would break down and change, and Altana could build some software to help people in a new era of globalization. That bet seems very prescient right now ‚Äî but also maybe a little bit destabilized, given how globalization might change. Explain what you mean by that manifesto, that founding statement that globalization is breaking down.

The premise was that the side effects and the unintended consequences of globalization since World War II were creating its demise. That breaks down into a few dimensions, principally around geopolitics. So it‚Äôs the US and China playing out a great power competition principally in the supply chain and economic theater. We can go back to that‚Äîthe other one‚Äôs around climate. So you had this race to the bottom, where everything was outsourced to the lowest cost, just-in-time manufacturing locations, and the world‚Äôs physical production became dirtier and dirtier and dirtier. And you have these increasing climate dislocations and the policies, and the corporate actions, and the capital market actions that are following as a result.

The third one was around the destabilization of the middle class of the West. So if you have a rapid sort of outsourcing and a collapse of manufacturing, then the point of view was you‚Äôre going to have a populist response. And I think we‚Äôve seen that play out. The fourth thing we said was that these just-in-time supply chains are only economically efficient under conditions of stability. Because of reasons one through three, our point of view was that the world was getting a whole lot less stable. Therefore, the supply chain itself ‚Äî the fabric of the world‚Äôs physical economy ‚Äî was going to break down. And I think that‚Äôs borne out since COVID. We didn‚Äôt literally predict COVID-19, but we did predict the fragility in the system.

I am the editor-in-chief of The Verge; I often think about things in terms of the iPhone. I‚Äôm a kid of the ‚Äò80s and ‚Äò90s. I remember Ross Perot saying that NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, would lead to a giant sucking sound of labor being moved to Mexico. I think a lot of people believe that it played out exactly that way.

But at the same time, you also get the ability to make a product like the iPhone, which is just inherently global. It‚Äôs manufactured in several countries around the world, principally in China, but lots of parts flow back into China so Apple can make that product. They make it at an enormous scale. But then you can look at the Tim Cook era, and you can say from one perspective, ‚ÄúHe increased Apple‚Äôs stock price.‚Äù But from another perspective, you can look at it and say, ‚ÄúOh, the iPhone has actually prevented the great power conflict,‚Äù right?

Everyone wants an iPhone. If the Chinese government somehow makes it impossible for people to buy iPhones in China, that would be bad. If the US government makes it impossible for US customers to buy the iPhone, that would be bad, and both economies would crash. And that‚Äôs going to keep us from being in a war.

And again, I‚Äôm a kid of the ‚Äò80s and ‚Äò90s. When I was in college, John Mearsheimer wrote The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, which is a big book that predicted the United States and China would go to war, and the next day was September 11th, and then that whole thing got sent to the side. Now maybe we‚Äôre back to it, but I just look at all of that, and your thesis, which feels correct, like it‚Äôs being borne out, and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOh, this thing is actually being held together by some consumer products.‚Äù

Making those consumer products and making our economies interdependent is the thing that keeps us from going to World War III. Are you all the way there? Are you building software to be like, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm going to try to hold this together a little bit longer?‚Äù

I‚Äôm building software and AI to help the public and private sectors navigate that dislocation and hopefully build resilience and some amount of decoupling without it resulting in a hot war.

But look, the version that you described of the economic ties that bind, I too kind of had that economic worldview. I got an economics degree from Yale in 2007, so at the absolute apex of the neoliberal and kind of neoconservative worldview, where‚Ä¶ I literally went to school with Thomas Friedman‚Äôs daughter, and I read all of his books. His famous thing was the Golden Arches theory, right? Countries that have McDonald‚Äôs don‚Äôt go to war with each other, which was true then. So, the premise was that free trade and economic interdependence result in peace between nations. And as I‚Äôve gotten older, I‚Äôve kind of watched the world progress, studied more of history, and read some Mearsheimer, and I‚Äôve actually kind of come to the exact opposite view ‚Äî meaning peace gives rise to free trade and not the other way around.

When there is an equilibrium in the whole global geopolitical great power competition, then what you see through history is that trade progresses between nations; and then in the moments of disequilibrium and big shifts in power, those become more violent. Then trade collapses. And so, my fear right now is that we‚Äôre in a disequilibrium. You have a rising great power. You have multipolarity with Russia and the EU asserting themselves in different ways, and the US, at least on a relative basis as a declining power, is no longer the single global hegemony. Over the last 15 years, if you look at the world, it‚Äôs in a state of disequilibrium, and I see the tariff issue. I see all this trade policy and volatility. I see all the economic security policies and industrial policies following as a result. So it‚Äôs all sort of nested within that big geopolitical circumstance.

When you think about the thesis of Altana, in which you identified that globalization is running one version of its course, and there‚Äôs going to be a next version... I‚Äôm reading your manifesto. Your idea here is: We‚Äôre going to need a lot more data so we can build supply chains across our partners that we trust, across actual suppliers that we trust, so we can see the social costs in other countries of outsourcing or the social cost of outsourcing labor to other countries. I look at that, and what I see is, ‚ÄúOh, we should make globalization better.‚Äù

It‚Äôs changing. There are some great power dynamics, but we are still going to have this. I look at the Trump administration and the imposition of tariffs, and the idea that we‚Äôre going to annex Canada, and we should stop it, right? The response from basically every member of the Trump administration to the question ‚ÄúAre tariffs going to cross prices to go up?‚Äù Is, ‚ÄúWell, then you should manufacture it here.‚Äù That seems wholly unworkable to me.

Again, I just go back to the iPhone. I‚Äôve listened to every explanation from every Apple executive, from Steve Jobs on down, about why the iPhone can‚Äôt be built in the United States of America. And they seem correct. I take them at their word that if they could solve the problem, they would. And yet the Trump administration seems to think that just by turning the knob on costs they will be able to bring manufacturing back to the United States. Do you think that‚Äôs possible?

I think it‚Äôs certainly possible to bring some manufacturing back to the United States. I also think it‚Äôs possible to bring a lot more manufacturing into North America. So, in other words, we‚Äôll do some things more and better, and you have both the labor cost environment and the national security, or sorry, the natural resources, starting in southern Mexico and going north. You have that stratification of low-cost, relatively low-skilled labor going to higher-skilled, higher-cost labor, and you can manufacture most of everything that the United States consumes in our backyard, so to speak.

So that‚Äôs just sort of a fact of the market around us. Will that happen entirely? No. And will that happen immediately? No. So then, what‚Äôs the policy objective of the Trump administration? I‚Äôm not in the Trump administration, so I won‚Äôt speak to it with total authority, but I have spoken with people who are in the Trump administration, and I think there are two key themes. One is yes, absolutely, there‚Äôs a motivation to bring manufacturing back to the United States and back within the USMCA, which is the US, Mexico, Canada Free Trade Agreement that replaced NAFTA under the first Trump administration.

Which might be again replaced by the annexation of Canada. Even that doesn‚Äôt seem like a stable foundation, but okay, continue. We‚Äôll take it, but some people in the Trump administration published that data.

Objective number one. Right. So, theatrics aside, policy objective number one is that we want to bring industry back generally, and we want to rebuild a middle class. It‚Äôs an industrialization initiative, and they want to do that by creating trade barriers. The Biden administration had a similar objective, but they did that through very large-scale subsidies and industrial policy initiatives to direct capital toward those industries they wanted to see in America. So that‚Äôs thing one.

The second thing is there‚Äôs a very clear objective, which he‚Äôs given to his policy team, to be strategically decoupled from China in critical industries by the end of his term. Critical industries ‚Äî a kind of policy-speak for things that matter a lot, like food, telecom, aerospace, defense, and advanced electronics. The things that we couldn‚Äôt do without. Everyone‚Äôs less concerned about toys and apparel and more concerned about the things that are critical to our economic and national security. He‚Äôs told his team that within four years, we need to bend the supply chain such that the United States no longer has these fundamental dependencies on China. So that‚Äôs going to impact everything from critical minerals to chips to everything downstream of those, like pharmaceuticals. It‚Äôs a huge, huge economic policy objective with sweeping consequences for the private sector.

I want to hold on discussing China for one second because I want to come back to it and talk about it in depth.

Altana builds software that helps people see these supply chains. Describe how you build the software and what it does for your customers because I think understanding your viewpoint and your visibility into these supply chains will help me understand how you can see the shift from China in real time.

The whole world‚Äôs a supply chain. At the base level, what we do is model the whole physical world of companies making things and buying and selling them from other companies. So it‚Äôs like a bottom-up, Google Maps-style view of all the companies ‚Äî where they operate, what they make and sell, and the connections between them. In the same way that Facebook built a social graph that connects everybody within six degrees of Kevin Bacon, and LinkedIn is our professional relationship graph which shows how you‚Äôre connected to all your colleagues and counterparts‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre doing the same thing but at the scale of the whole global supply chain network. So that‚Äôs the foundation. And the way that our customers primarily use that is to understand and manage what are called value chains. This matters in the context of the globalization discussion we were just having.

So, what‚Äôs a value chain? A value chain for any product is the whole network of production all the way back to the soil. Let‚Äôs take the iPhone: The silicon comes out of the ground, it turns into chips, and it turns into all the logic in your phone. The graphite comes out of the ground, the aluminum comes out of the ground. The whole system of raw materials through the intermediate goods, through the final assembly, and the sale and end use of the product is called the product value chain. We make it possible to know and manage that whole network for all the products in the world, and it sits on top of that map of the world that we‚Äôve built. So why is that novel? Because of globalization and outsourcing.

There was a deliberate move to outsource that whole value chain. The whole theory was that we should only do our comparative advantage. We should only do the most specialized version of that within our borders, and everything else got outsourced and outsourced and outsourced and outsourced. So it became impossible to really know your supplier‚Äôs supplier or your supplier‚Äôs, supplier‚Äôs supplier, and even in the other direction. Western electronics companies keep seeing their stuff get into Russian weapons systems. Well, they‚Äôre mostly not selling to Russia, so it‚Äôs that customer‚Äôs, customer‚Äôs, customer that‚Äôs receiving the electronics, right? That‚Äôs the value chain.

We make it possible to know that and to map it, manage it, and actually collaborate with those value chain partners. The story I like to tell is in the 1950s, Ford Motor Company used to own the entire value chain of its cars. They owned rubber plantations in Brazil to make tires, and now they just do the final assembly. So that‚Äôs the point. Boeing doesn‚Äôt own its value chains anymore. They can‚Äôt even make an airplane. Ford is in the final assembly business. Apple doesn‚Äôt even manufacture anything; they just create the software and the designs, and everybody else manufactures it. So what we‚Äôre doing at our core is we‚Äôre kind of making it possible to do what the industry used to do, which is to see and connect and have some control over that whole network.

In our case, you don‚Äôt have to own the whole network. You can illuminate it to see the compliance, security, and resilience dimensions of it. And we can actually give our customers the ability to map, manage, and collaborate across that whole network.

So you collect a bunch of data from across these value chains from different suppliers. Why do these companies give you that data?

They don‚Äôt share it in the broadest sense. What they‚Äôre doing is they‚Äôre connecting to a network that we provide. And the thing we built the company around, the core invention of Altana, was that everybody could kind of keep their data sovereign, siloed, private, and connected to the network, and we‚Äôd sort of solve for both at the same time. What that means practically is that it‚Äôs like a hub-and-spoke federated data model. So we provide the shared map of the world and all the software and AI systems in the hub, and our customers keep their data in a spoke, and we bring the platform down to their data and not the other way around.

There‚Äôs a Maersk spoke, there‚Äôs an LL Bean spoke, there‚Äôs a General Atomic spoke. None of those customers are sharing all their raw data with each other. They‚Äôre not allowing us to pool it all centrally, but what they are doing is subjecting their data to the network; they‚Äôre connecting their data to our platform, and they‚Äôre seeing how they fit within the broader network. We learned from that. We build out the network connections, and we train AI systems, and that all adds up to a model where every customer that joins adds to the visibility, connectivity, and intelligence for all the other parties.

Put that into practice for me. Let‚Äôs just use LL Bean. LL Bean wants to manufacture some more hats for the stores for ski season. What does Altana help them do?

LL Bean tends to know not just the garment manufacturer it buys from and has a direct relationship with, it will also sometimes know the textile manufacturers that feed into those garment facilities. What it doesn‚Äôt know is everything upstream of that. It‚Äôs like, where does the cotton come from? Where does the polyester come from? Where does the zipper come from? At the base layer, we just help them answer the question: What‚Äôs the whole network of the value chain for every one of my goods, all the way back to the soil? They‚Äôre motivated by a few things.

One is ensuring that their goods are compliant and free of forced labor. So speaking of trade barriers, that was a big one that happened in 2022. The US banned all imports of goods into the United States that have any of that upstream value chain content coming from Shenzhen, China. So it‚Äôs a rebuttable presumption that the Uyghur forced labor issue was sort of infecting all those goods. So that‚Äôs a big one.

You literally can‚Äôt import to the United States, and they‚Äôve had detentions; everybody in the industries had detentions. And so, navigating through that, making sure the value chains are healthy and compliant, and that you don‚Äôt have these big multi-million dollar, tens of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars of border interruptions and delays.

So that‚Äôs one. And now they‚Äôre expanding that to look at all things sustainability in their value chain. So how do you use Altana to understand your carbon footprint? How do you understand the workers‚Äô rights and ecological impacts of production, all the way through the chain, and on and on and on? We become that sort of foundational network that they use to not just see the whole global value chain network but then engage it and make it better over time.

I‚Äôm still just thinking about the incentives to expose any data to your network. I get it at the top level, right? A car company or a shipping company at the top level wants to see all this data, but then you need information from the lowest levels of that from the soil. Why does the big industrial producer in China want anyone to know where its products are coming from?

I‚Äôm not sure they do in all cases, but what‚Äôs interesting is they now have to in more and more cases. The big arc of policy here, whether it‚Äôs tariffs, forced labor bans, or a carbon border adjustment in Europe‚Ä¶ I can paint a big picture, but in the last two years alone, there have been 1,200 net new trade barriers added. And basically, what it says is that if you want the downstream goods, the car, the iPhone, or the clothes to make their way into the UK, the US, Europe, Australia, or Canada, then the large upstream manufacturer has to disclose all this information about your goods and your production practices.

That‚Äôs always been a little bit true in the context of moving goods across borders. There are certificates of origin and customs classifications that depend on the nature of the goods, and that‚Äôs how you pay your tariffs and duties. And you give the Food and Drug Administration the certificates and permits. That all is kind of business as usual. What‚Äôs so different over the last few years is they‚Äôve created so many new and more stringent requirements on that whole upstream value chain, saying, ‚ÄúYou have to share this information with us, you have to make these declarations, and it‚Äôs a matter of market access.‚Äù So your customers and your customers‚Äô customers can‚Äôt get their goods into the biggest markets in the world without it.

When you look at what Altana provides in that, that‚Äôs a problem to be solved. You can say, ‚ÄúOkay, well, add some software to make it easier to share data better.‚Äù

You‚Äôre also talking about adding AI to it. What kind of insights are you generating from collecting all this data? It seems like you have an enterprise data provisioning problem, but then you also, generally with AI, want to see all the data and collect an insight [from it]. It seems like there‚Äôs a tension between wanting to see the information across the whole network and actually generating insights.

Where do you get the data, and what kind of insights do you generate?

We get the data across both the publicly available and commercially purchasable universe of data. I mean, we spend a lot of money bringing all the data to us that we can get our hands on. And then, as I mentioned earlier, every customer that joins the platform is connecting their data to that model of the world, and then it‚Äôs subjecting their data to that whole framework of visibility and shared learning. So we‚Äôre now at the place where roughly half of all that supply chain connectivity, all the supply chain visibility, is coming from our customer network itself. That‚Äôs another way of saying that we‚Äôve doubled what you can theoretically do by going out and scraping the internet, getting publicly available data, and licensing data from commercial vendors. So we‚Äôve exhausted what you can do in the public domain, and we‚Äôve now about doubled that, and the lead keeps compounding.

We use AI to connect all that data together. So it‚Äôs billions and billions of data points. It‚Äôs really messy stuff. It‚Äôs in Chinese, Cyrillic, and Spanish, so it‚Äôs in many different languages. You don‚Äôt have the benefit of unique IDs, like you do in personal data, where an email address or a telephone number can help you join all the records together, like Nilay or Evan. In the world of businesses and transactions, purchase orders, and shipments, you just have this messy, semi-structured text. You need AI to process all that data and connect it into one clean, unified representation of the world. We‚Äôve been building our own homegrown AI systems since day one to do that. Then, you need AI to map out those value chains. So that‚Äôs where we‚Äôve invested really heavily over the last few years.

We can almost instantaneously illuminate the inputs and outputs of anybody‚Äôs products across the whole global network with very, very high fidelity. So that‚Äôs always a jaw-dropping wow moment with customers, where it‚Äôs like, how could you possibly know this, and how could you possibly draw these connections? And then, on top of that foundation, we have AI systems that are doing everything from detecting single points of failure and business interruption risks. We can look at the whole network and say, ‚ÄúHere are upstream suppliers that are at risk of failing financially, just by sensing what‚Äôs happening in the supply chain.‚Äù That‚Äôs been one of our crazy success stories over the last year, just seeing the model perform on that.

We have AI systems that automate all of the cross-border tariff and customs compliance work and all the logic associated with that. So that‚Äôs a $150 billion per year industry ‚Äî just humans reading text about the nature of the goods and then assigning them the codes when they come across a border that say, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the tariffs and duties, and certificates, and permits.‚Äù So we have an agentic AI system that‚Äôs doing all of that. You can put the customer‚Äôs broker in the loop and give them ultimate control, but that‚Äôs become wildly performant. That‚Äôs not the whole list, but the point is that it‚Äôs AI constructing the map. It‚Äôs AI to show the customers how they fit inside of the map, what are the networks that are relevant to them, and then also AI that generates insight and automates entire workflows.

Let me ask the two Decoder questions, and then I want to put all this into practice with what‚Äôs happening in trade right now. How big is Altana right now, and how have you structured the company?

We‚Äôre about 240 people and our two primary lines of business are enterprise and government. We then have financial services partners and logistics partners through whom we service the enterprise. So, they connect to our platform to better serve their customers and connect them to the network.

How do you make decisions? What‚Äôs your framework?

This has evolved pretty meaningfully in the last few months. So, where I have little depth or relatively little depth, depending on the team around me, I try to speak last and ask questions, and then decide when I need to break ties or move the group forward. And then, the net new thing over the last couple of months is permitting myself to be very decisive when I‚Äôm deep in the details and driving the company forward that way. So I‚Äôve actually leaned in pretty aggressively on product management and some big audacious product bets we‚Äôre making right now, and a lot of the network architecture we‚Äôre building to connect the public and private sectors into this whole global value chain network. And so, on those two dimensions, I‚Äôm highly opinionated, and I‚Äôm driving very, very fast decision-making by doing it myself and bringing groups along with me.

Do you think that‚Äôs reflective of the fact that the foundation of the entire global economy seems to be changing very quickly?

It‚Äôs a big part of it. We started the conversation where you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúHey, all these things seem to be coming true,‚Äù and that‚Äôs true. Our lived experience is that these things we kind of expected would be relevant products that could exist on top of our platform... Over time, we‚Äôll do this, and then we‚Äôll do this, and we‚Äôll do this. There‚Äôs demand for most of it right now. And so, the big scramble in Altana is like, how do we launch new software? How do we meet the demand? How do we get out there, and how do we do this from a unified base? I‚Äôm finding myself in wartime mode and calling a lot of shots to get through that stuff with velocity.

How real-time is the insight you get? You mentioned being able to detect when an upstream provider might be failing, right? Is that in real time? Is that‚Ä¶ You wake up, and there‚Äôs a map, and there‚Äôs a blinking red light, or is it on a trailing basis?

It‚Äôs actually a spectrum. So some of the data we process is ‚Äî I think of it as negative latency. You see the intent of a transaction before it occurs in real life through what are called booking requests and shipping instructions. That could be a thing that will happen five weeks from now. And then, we get the shipment itself, and then we get the customs entry associated with the shipment. So you see this life cycle of the supply chain activity. We also have real-time event feeds through a partnership with Dataminr, and we can overlay that on the whole map of the world and contextualize that for our customers. You see some things that kind of develop over time ‚Äî in that, you need more pieces of data, pieces of signal to kind of build up a broader picture you feel good about. So it‚Äôs really a spectrum. There are some things that you can see far ahead of the curve. It‚Äôs totally predictive. Some of it is more‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs something sort of taking shape in the network, and then some of it is sort of post-factum.

All right, let me put all of this into a blender. I think I‚Äôve got a sense of the company and what you can see. Trump announces tariffs; 24 hours later, he walks back the tariffs, and then he announces them again. Maybe they‚Äôre on. Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, shows up on CNBC and says they‚Äôre going to go away. Do you see that reflected in the data? Do you see that across the network?

What does that look like? Do you see the aftershocks of it? Do you see the supply chain reconfiguring?

Yes and yes. And this goes back years because the first Trump administration was the first to go hard with tariffs, and Biden continued it. So yeah, you do see a couple of things. The obvious one is for the goods that have tariffs applied. You see a redistribution of imports associated with the tariffed goods from the tariffed countries, and then this is kind of obvious, but it‚Äôs either going to be manufactured locally, or it‚Äôs going to come from other places where the tariffs don‚Äôt apply. The more interesting thing that you see is that the ownership structures associated with these big global supply chain networks change, and so does the nature of the value chains. So what happened in Trump‚Äôs first term, when there was a bunch of Chinese economic policy and trade barriers that were put up, was you saw a big shift in Chinese supply chains going to Mexico and Canada, where two things happened.

In one case, they would just do final assembly, so they‚Äôd ship all the refrigerator parts to Mexico, turn it into a refrigerator, and then import it into the United States under USMCA and not pay tariffs. The other version of it was through what‚Äôs called the e-commerce de minimis threshold, where the premise was like, if the goods are under $800, we don‚Äôt need to do a whole customs entry, pay tariffs, and put a trade compliance process in place. Let‚Äôs just rip it into the country and get consumers what they want.

So then, unsurprisingly, you had these mega warehouses built up on the Mexican and Canadian borders, where they were drop-shipping items under $800, or even components that were sort of disassembled so that each of them was under $800 and then imported into the United States through that loophole. Both of those things are coming to an end, and it‚Äôs obviously a little chaotic, but I see the whole USMCA tariff thing through those lenses. And the other thing I should say is that it‚Äôs really interesting when you see the ownership networks because we map those too. You‚Äôre seeing all these Chinese companies open Mexican and Canadian subsidiaries to import goods from themselves and then bring them into the United States, subject to those exemptions I just spoke to.

Is that what‚Äôs driving all of the posturing towards Canada and Mexico? Is it an underlying sense that China‚Äôs actually taking advantage of those agreements?

Yeah. I have to get a little wonky to argue the case. So yes is the answer, and if you look at where the tariff thing landed, and again, by the time this airs, who knows where we are, but where it landed three or four days ago was they said, ‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôre going to do the 25 percent Mexico and Canada tariffs for any goods coming into the United States that are not registered under the USMCA.‚Äù

That was fine print in the announcement. That is pretty consequential. What that means is that companies that bother to prove that the material origin of their goods is within the value chain definitions of the USMCA ‚Äî again, this is the free trade agreement that replaced NAFTA ‚Äî those companies and products are not subject to the tariffs. That‚Äôs roughly 40 percent of Mexican and Canadian trade with the US. So the 60 percent that hasn‚Äôt done the work, to say the raw materials and the intermediate goods are all eligible as per the USMCA ‚Äî and they‚Äôre part of our free trade world ‚Äî those 60 percent of goods are still subject to the 25 percent tariffs. At the same time, they hit China with extra tariffs. So they‚Äôve now done two, a 10 percent and another 10 percent on all Chinese imports. The dotted line through all those things is that the Trump administration is trying to bring Mexico and Canada into tighter alignment with the United States and its trade policy vis-√†-vis China.

And all of that is to say, we want more manufacturing here in the North American continent and to get away from China.

You‚Äôve got a big map of the world. You see the value chains, you see where things are manufactured. If you just look at where all the puzzle pieces are today, can you actually accomplish that in four years? Can you decouple the United States from China at the end of Trump‚Äôs term? You said that was the goal, and I don‚Äôt know how to take those Jenga blocks and make that tower. I know how to knock the tower down; that seems very obvious to me. But I don‚Äôt know how to make the tower or make a new tower.

What I believe is that they‚Äôre going to try, and then in some cases, you‚Äôre talking about billions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars of capital expenditure (CapEx) in the ground in China. Some of the biggest chemical companies in the world have manufacturing locations in China that feed into all of our pharmaceuticals and advanced manufacturing processes. Is that kind of CapEx possible to replicate elsewhere within a four-year timeframe? That‚Äôs going to be pretty tough.

Do we even have the capital to do it?

There‚Äôs a lot of capital sloshing around the world.

Yeah.

Yeah. So, should the US government invest in that, and will it? Certainly not in this administration. It will not do that, right?

I suppose the operative part of my question there was the ‚Äúwe.‚Äù There is a lot of capital, but do we in the United States have the ability, the will, or the coordination to do it? That seems up in the air.

I do think, philosophically, what this administration is saying is rather than the Biden approach of using mostly incentives and capital to build the things that we want here‚Ä¶ So the IRA, the CHIPS Act... those deployed a lot of capital and loan guarantees and other ways to kind of subsidize and motivate the manufacturing of those things here. What this administration is doing is saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to use trade barriers to restrict the market access of competitive products,‚Äù and a lot of it‚Äôs aimed at China obviously, ‚Äúand we‚Äôre going to let the market figure out the rest.‚Äù So we‚Äôre going to create the barriers. We‚Äôre going to distort supply and demand and then let capitalism figure it out from there.

On what timeframe do you think capitalism figures that out? Again, I‚Äôm just looking at Altana‚Äôs product, right? You have a view of this system and how it reacts to different kinds of shocks. What timeframe do you think that we can figure this out?

It is just a spectrum. I mean, a lot of these things are already in motion, so you‚Äôre just accelerating the near-shoring of advanced electronics. You‚Äôre accelerating the near-shoring of automotive supply chains. The pharmaceutical CEOs I‚Äôve talked to in the last six months have already been talking about creating new manufacturing locations outside of China for all their key stuff. Some of these things are going to move a lot more quickly, and some of these things are going to be pretty tough. I think for those examples where you just have massive CapEx in China, it‚Äôs really hard. And I think the most intractable one, honestly, is what are called critical minerals.

It is rare earths, which we all have heard of, and then the other metals that go into all of our most important electronics. So, think nickel. Nickel‚Äôs not rare, but it‚Äôs critical. And China has a virtual lock on all of the world‚Äôs critical mineral processing. They don‚Äôt have a lock on the raw material itself. The raw materials are pretty pervasive. They‚Äôre abundant. China, over the last 25 years, was very deliberate about building a stranglehold on the refining of the raw ores. And this is nasty stuff, right? These are typically big open pit mines where they‚Äôre doing cyanide leaching to separate these ores from other metals and refine them. So it‚Äôs stuff we don‚Äôt actually want in our backyard, which is all well and good if there‚Äôs a free trade environment. But in a world of geopolitical and economic competition, China now has between 60 percent and 98 percent of the world‚Äôs critical minerals on lockdown, and they use that market position now to kill any emergent refining in a country or a company that they don‚Äôt control.

So a new one pops up, and we‚Äôre refining lithium, and we‚Äôre doing Lithium oxides. Well, you‚Äôre going to see, and this has happened repeatedly, China floods the market, depresses the price, and puts that company out of business. They either go away, or the Chinese company buys them. And so, the reason this really matters is that you can‚Äôt make missiles, airplanes, guns, telephones, or GPS [without these minerals]. Our everyday modern economy depends on all these critical minerals, and they all run through China. So, can that be fixed in four years? No, not without a radical sort of World War II-style change in our regulatory stance, our willingness to invest, and a massive cross-border partnership with our allies. I don‚Äôt see that happening.

When you describe that, I think about directed industrial policy, right? China made a decision. They made a huge trade-off against their environmental policy, the air quality that their people breathe and the labor abuses their workers might suffer, but they said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worth it, because over some timeframe we will have this stranglehold on the market and that will create peace, create prosperity,‚Äù some set of goals that industrial policy will deliver.

We can look at Taiwan, for example. On this show, we‚Äôve talked a lot about TSMC and Taiwan‚Äôs massive investment in the chip industry because it saw the future and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do that here. We‚Äôre going to make an industrial policy from the top down that says all the chips are going to be made in Taiwan. TSMC is our national champion; here we go.‚Äù

Those things came true. Again, the trade-offs are very real, and very clear. We don‚Äôt have a directed industrial policy in the United States. To the extent that the Biden administration was trying, they were doing it in the most Freakonomics neoliberal way you could do it, right? They created a bunch of incentives, and they hoped people would not game them. You can see how that played out for them.

The Trump administration is doing the exact opposite, right? They‚Äôre creating a bunch of impediments and saying, ‚ÄúOur market is so valuable that if you want the n+1 American consumer to buy your car, you have to do a bunch of stuff to get to our market.‚Äù

That seems just as naive. It‚Äôs still not directed industrial policy. It‚Äôs negative incentives instead of positive incentives, and you still might game the system in some way. But it doesn‚Äôt seem like that plan of, we have to actually say out loud, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do nickel refining to decouple from China.‚Äù They haven‚Äôt said that out loud.

They‚Äôve said, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a bunch of structural impediments that might result in some capital directed at nickel refining in the United States.‚Äù

And that to me seems again, for all the criticisms of the Biden programs, like you run into the same problems. You‚Äôre not actually saying what you want. You‚Äôre hoping that the negative incentives will create momentum for the market to deliver the result.

I would add one thing to the picture you painted, though, just to be fair about it. The other thing that the Trump administration is trying to do is massively deregulate. So, why isn‚Äôt there nickel refining in the United States? Because it‚Äôs impossible to get it permitted. It‚Äôll never happen, right?

But again, that‚Äôs a trade-off, right? There‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt want nickel refining.

I‚Äôm not making a normative judgment. I‚Äôm just describing the landscape I see. I think the Trump thesis here is, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs remove the barriers to building, let‚Äôs create the barriers to what they view as unfair trade and economic abuses by adversaries. Let‚Äôs let the market figure out the rest.‚Äù

And you‚Äôre asking, is there a third way? In general, my perspective is that the United States can‚Äôt possibly out-centralize China. It can‚Äôt possibly out-execute top-down economic control better than China does. Our comparative advantage, our right to win, is through innovation. So create a rule of law and a risk capital environment, and a labor environment where the best ideas can win, people can take risks, and that can flush through the system ‚Äî that has been our comparative advantage. I‚Äôm more sympathetic to an economic security framework that plays to our right to win than one that doesn‚Äôt. I think the Biden kind of Freakonomics thing you described was very much like, ‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs sort of take other examples of central planning and industrial policy, and make these big billion, a hundred billion dollar, trillion dollar injections into sectors of the economy and specific recipients of aid, and then hope it works out.‚Äù

That‚Äôs what China does. I‚Äôm not so optimistic about that working for us. So I do think there‚Äôs a big question of, ‚ÄúIs there a third way, and what should the economic security policy framework of the United States be?‚Äù That‚Äôs a conversation I‚Äôm getting into more and more in the academic and think tank worlds. I don‚Äôt think we have a coherent answer to that as policymakers, and I don‚Äôt even think we have the language for it in a lot of cases.

A lot of what you‚Äôre talking about with the comparative advantage of the United States historically being risk-taking innovation, I agree with that. The foundation of that has been the relative stability of the United States after World War II. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs been totally stable ‚Äî it hasn‚Äôt. No one listening to the show looks back across the last 20 years and thinks, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs been stable.‚Äù

But fundamentally, politically, we‚Äôre stable. Economically, there is a sense of stability. Data-wise, we have not, until recently, had the United States government deciding that it will redefine how GDP is calculated. There‚Äôs sort of an essential policy and economic stability to how the United States works.

Your company relies on some amount of stability in the system, right? Even to just look at a system and say, ‚ÄúWe can see how things are moving,‚Äù implies that all the actors in the system are rational or predictable in some set of ways, or at least participating. That is what feels destabilized right now.

The tariffs are on, the tariffs are off. We‚Äôre going to export bourbon to Canada. We‚Äôre not going to do that anymore. Trump is going to say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to cut our own lumber in the United States,‚Äù but all the trees are in Canada. That seems destabilizing. We‚Äôre going to decouple from China in four years. Inherently destabilizing. Apple is going to announce $500 billion worth of investment that they already planned for, and somehow, that‚Äôs going to make it okay. All of that seems new and destabilizing in a way that, even in Trump‚Äôs first term, didn‚Äôt exist. Do you see that? Is that reflected? Do you worry about that?

I mean, back to the beginning of the conversation, we bet our careers on it. I just see it as an inevitability. I am a macro guy. I like these big systems problems, and I‚Äôve seen, for a long time now, the gears of history cranking. It‚Äôs pretty obvious to me that the system I grew up in, and I think the orthodoxies of our time, have come to an end. And so, yeah, it‚Äôs destabilizing. The moment in time is one of instability and destabilization. I see these trends playing out almost irrespective of who‚Äôs in office here or there. Like, look at Brexit, look at what‚Äôs happening in the EU. Look at all the climate dislocation and the waves of immigration across borders that then result in nationalism and populism. And you kind of add all these mega-trends up. The rise of China, the relative decline of the United States, the global debt burden and how that‚Äôs playing out in economic policy, and wealth inequality are these asset bubbles inflated and reflated. All these things, to me, signal a breakdown of the system.

When you look at your map and you see China in the center of it, and almost all these value chains end up flowing through or around China, can that be reallocated? Can you shift things around to a world where you have the United States and its allies‚Äô value chain and China and its allies‚Äô value chain?

I mostly see it going there, at least for the more sensitive critical value chains. I don‚Äôt see it playing out any other way. And this isn‚Äôt just a sort of the US doing its thing. China publishes its economic intentions every five years, and then they reify them and the national addresses. This is their explicit strategy: to create economic resilience and dominance in the technologies that they believe will be the commanding heights of the 21st century. And to ensure that the value chains associated with them as either critical imports or as exports where they know they need to deploy their production capacity (because they‚Äôre an export-driven economy) ‚Äî they are explicitly trying to secure both. And they write it down, and they do what they say. To some extent, how did we get here? We had a rules-based free trade order that the United States architected, and everything made a lot of sense economically, middle class impacts aside.

The admission of China to the World Trade Organization in 2001, I think, was the end. That was the beginning of the end. And you had a very large and growing economy that was exploiting the free trade system systematically, stealing trillions of dollars of intellectual property to feed their industrial engine and subsidizing their exports at the expense of everybody else‚Äôs markets. And so, 25 years later, we are where we are. And so, it was sort of bigger than its neighbor at an unprecedented scale, and I think the system is responding to that fact, right? That was the catalyst. It wasn‚Äôt that somebody here or there was elected and did some policy actions. So I view things in sort of this multi-decade lens, and the policy environment, the political environment right now is a consequence of that as opposed to the primary driver of it, if that makes sense.

I wrote my law review article in law school on China‚Äôs use of open-source software to get itself into the WTO. And their approach to intellectual property was, ‚ÄúOh, well, we‚Äôll do copyright law,‚Äù because that is a foundation for open-source. And now we have Linux. That was a fascinating rhetorical move. I don‚Äôt know if my law review article was any good, and I don‚Äôt know if anybody understood what I was talking about at the time, but I was like, ‚ÄúPay attention to Red Flag Linux.‚Äù

The other end of that, the positive end of that, is one where we start, the iPhone. The iPhone exists at scale, at a massive scale. The idea that we manufacture as many iPhones as we do with three nanometer TSMC chips in them is mind-boggling.

There are many criticisms of Tim Cook one could issue, but‚Ä¶ Did you maintain the rules-based world trade order for as long as you did because the iPhone is such a successful product, and you managed all of those supply chains? You managed both Trump‚Äôs first term and the Biden administration through COVID-19. That‚Äôs a remarkable fact of American industrial policy, right? Apple exists, and it held the world together for a minute.

Do you think that there are still those kinds of products or those kinds of companies that will keep this thing going even as everything else gets destabilized? Because that is the success. There has not been a great power conflict or a hot war between the United States and China in all this time. Even as things frayed, even as both sides felt taken advantage of or felt hostile towards each other, or sent fighter jets flying at each other for no reason, just to have a good time.

Honestly, I hope that I can look back at the whole arc of Altana and say that we are one of those companies that bent the arc of history in that way.

How‚Äôs that?

I think we‚Äôre making it possible to be resilient and to navigate this change for both the public and private sectors. I mean, we work with governments of the West and allies to enforce this stuff, to navigate it, to find some of the dependencies and vulnerabilities in these networks, and to mitigate them. We also help them simulate policies and see how they might play out. What are the direct impacts for the second, third, and fourth order impacts so that better decisions get made? And then we work with the private sector to navigate all that stuff. And so, if we succeed at the scale that we‚Äôre trying to, our mission is to fix globalization.

Then, I think you can envision a world where business in the West and business in the East continue to be transnational, and you have these miracles of productivity, and you have the economic ties that bind. At the same time, you de-risk the most critical infrastructure and the most critical supply chains. Through that de-risking, you prevent accidents from happening, and you prevent the worst from happening.

So, paint a picture like, let‚Äôs say China moves on Taiwan by the end of the decade. And I‚Äôve been in a war game with US military leadership, where one of their assumptions is that GPS goes off, and all of the critical water and electricity facilities in America are shut down. Our cars can no longer navigate because of all the logic in our cars. And those are all through supply chain exploits that have been built into the systems by China over the last two decades and known vulnerabilities, known state-sponsored cyber attacks that create those exploits...

In that scenario, is America more or less likely to go to war? I actually think it‚Äôs more likely to go to war. I think there‚Äôs a higher probability that escalation occurs and tensions fray. There‚Äôs more popular support for conflict. And so, in a world where we‚Äôre more and more de-risked, where you don‚Äôt need to go to war over an island, where you don‚Äôt need to defend a specific supply chain or you don‚Äôt need to react to a vulnerability that your adversary exploited and shut down all the critical infrastructure in the country, that‚Äôs a world that, to me, is less likely to go to war.

I feel like some people will take issue with your characterization of Taiwan as an island, but I get it. Is there enough world? This is the biggest question that I have for you. Your software builds you a picture of the value chains across the world.

I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs enough capacity. I mean, it‚Äôs a big world. I am not saying all of it has been industrialized. We‚Äôre producing everything everywhere. But it does seem like with the past 25 years of globalization and maybe the next wave of globalization that you‚Äôre helping bring about, it has reached an equilibrium. And destabilizing that equilibrium just implies there will be more capacity, that we‚Äôre going to move the chips out of Taiwan and make them in India or something. I‚Äôm not sure that there‚Äôs enough capacity to reorient everything and maintain an equilibrium or to change it without something even more destabilizing happening.

I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre at or if you think you can actually make the shift. Because if you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúWe need to move to the next phase of globalization,‚Äù my view is that Trump may kind of want it to stop, right? And it still feels like tension.

I think there‚Äôs enormous production capacity at basically every stage of the value chain. So I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any kind of fundamental limit that we‚Äôre bumping up against, either in terms of labor price, labor skill, raw material availability, or manufacturing sophistication. And I‚Äôm also reasonably optimistic. I‚Äôm not maximally optimistic about automation and software-defined manufacturing and where a lot of this is going. So I think there‚Äôs an enormous amount of capital out there chasing good returns, and there‚Äôs an enormous wave of productivity gains that are already underway, and it‚Äôs going to keep scaling with AI and robotics. All those things add up to the means to refactor.

You‚Äôve got the big view; you‚Äôve got the software. If you‚Äôre someone listening to this, you‚Äôre an entrepreneur, you‚Äôre a builder ‚Äî we have a lot of those listening to the show ‚Äî where would you go build? Based on your map, what seems the most stable right now?

Geographically or in terms of industries?

Both.

So, tariffs notwithstanding, if I were starting from scratch and not doing Altana, the thing I‚Äôd be most excited about is building a software-enabled and AI-driven manufacturing value chain for advanced electronics in North America. I‚Äôd be focused on producing in Mexico, sourcing most of my components from North America, serving US and Canadian markets, and taking advantage of the free trade agreement that exists.

And again, the way that the tariffs just played out only applied to anything that wasn‚Äôt certified under the USMCA. As you know, North American origin got hit with tariffs, but everything that‚Äôs certified is still sort of free trade. I would go long on the Mexican demographics. I would go long on the Mexican economy, generally. I would go long on North American demand for advanced electronics components in everything from automobiles to aerospace, to defense, to the whole picture. And I would try to build a Shenzhen of North America. One big, integrated, and co-located value chain where you could really do mass-scale drone manufacturing, optics, the whole thing.

The Chinese government also made a huge investment in labor, right? When Obama asked Steve Jobs, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you make the iPhone here?‚Äù His answer was, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs just not enough manufacturing engineers. It‚Äôs not going to happen.‚Äù

Do you see that labor pool existing in the United States, Canada, or Mexico? Do you have to create it? Is the Mexican government going to be better at that than we are?

Mexico‚Äôs a lot better at it. We‚Äôre terrible. And I think some interesting experiments were begun with junior colleges and community colleges and some of those initiatives. But we‚Äôre nowhere close to having the skilled labor necessary to execute the industrialization objectives of either the Biden administration or the Trump administration. So, there is a massive gap in both of those worldviews and approaches.

Do you think that can be reconciled?

Partially, through automation. Not fully.

Evan, this has been an incredible conversation. I obviously could talk to you for another hour. You‚Äôre going to have to come back.

I want to know more about your law school thesis. I think China‚Äôs doing the same thing with open source and AI that they did with open source back then. But anyway, maybe that‚Äôs for another one.

Thank you for being the only person, including the editor of the Wisconsin International Law Journal, who has ever said, ‚ÄúI want to know more about this thesis.‚Äù I appreciate you for that. It was a good suck up to end the show. We‚Äôll have you back. Well, here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll do. When tariffs go on, we won‚Äôt have you. When tariffs go off, we‚Äôll have you. So, every few weeks, we‚Äôll have you back on the show.

All right, I‚Äôm going to be a regular.

Yeah, that‚Äôll be great. Evan, thank you so much. We‚Äôll talk to you soon.

Thanks for having me.

https://theverge.com,The OneXSugar asks: what if Nintendo Switch could transform into Nintendo DS?,https://theverge.com/news/631005/qualcomm-snapdragon-g3-gen-3-onexsugar-handheld-ayaneo-pocket,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.

The picture above does not contain two different gaming handhelds. Instead, this halo device for Qualcomm‚Äôs just-announced Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 gaming chips ‚Äî which I‚Äôll tell you about in a sec ‚Äî is a single transforming device with swing out gamepads and screens. It‚Äôs called the OneXSugar Sugar 1, and it‚Äôs one of the most delightfully gadgety gaming gadgets I‚Äôve seen.

Hold it horizontally like a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, flip out its secondary screen, then rotate its twin hinged gamepads for a more squared-off Nintendo DS-like experience:

If you listen closely, you can almost hear the emulation community jumping for joy at the idea of two different aspect ratio screens joined at the hip. Me, I‚Äôm busy imagining the satisfying and/or horrifying sounds it might make as its triple joints swing into action!

We know little more than what you can glean from the pictures and animations, but here are the key bits:

It‚Äôs from OneXPlayer, the same boutique Chinese gadget maker behind the three-in-one X1 and X1 Mini that I told you about last spring.

OneXPlayer plans to put it on preorder this May.

It‚Äôs got a 6.01-inch main screen and a 3.92-inch secondary display.

The joysticks are ‚Äúmagnetic,‚Äù though it‚Äôs not clear if that‚Äôs referring to the sticks themselves having Hall effect or TMR sensors, or whether OneX means the gamepads snap into place.

It‚Äôs an Android device with Qualcomm‚Äôs just-announced Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 processor inside, rather than an AMD-toting Windows gaming handheld.

Image: Qualcomm

Before you get your hopes up, the OneXPlayer OneXSugar is unlikely to become a machine aimed at Windows games too. For one thing, we‚Äôre looking at nice but modest gains of 30 percent more CPU performance and 28 percent more GPU performance than the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 announced in 2023. It doesn‚Äôt contain the Oryon CPU core that powers both Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon 8 Elite for phones or its Snapdragon X Elite for laptops, nor the Adreno X1 or Adreno 830 GPUs that respectively feature in those chips.

And while Qualcomm Snapdragon gaming lead Micah Knapp told journalists that the company might launch support for other operating systems ‚Äúover time,‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúreally focused on the Android side‚Äù as of today. That‚Äôs because China is such a huge market for Android gaming, the company hints. ‚ÄúThe perspective that Android gaming isn‚Äôt popular is a very region-centric perspective,‚Äù Qualcomm spokesperson Sascha Segan says when I ask.

That China interest is certainly helping produce some incredible looking devices. When Qualcomm first announced its last handheld gaming chips, the best it could show off was a dull batarang-shaped reference design. Today, in addition to the OneXSugar, it‚Äôs got the sleek metal-bodied Ayaneo Pocket S2, an Ayaneo Gaming Pad, and additionally two new Retroid Pocket devices on its new lower-tier chips, the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 and G1 Gen 2.

Here‚Äôs that Pocket S2:

Knapp tells me that his company doesn‚Äôt need to subsidize the development of Qualcomm handhelds, either. ‚ÄúTo be blunt, most of them are coming to us to build platforms on their own,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúPeople have accepted this is where things are going to happen, and now they‚Äôre just aggressively moving into the space,‚Äù he says.

Of the two lower-tier chips, the G2 Gen 2 claims significant gains of 2.3x the CPU performance and 3.8x the GPU performance of a Snapdragon G2 Gen 1, though I‚Äôm not aware of any particular handhelds shipping with that earlier chip, and neither Qualcomm nor Retroid have released images of its next horizontal handheld. The G1 Gen 2 boasts 80 percent greater CPU performance than G1 Gen 1, and a 25 percent faster GPU.

The Ayaneo Pocket S2 should be coming this month, the Retroid Pocket PR Classic should be up for preorder this month, and the Ayaneo Gaming Pad should be coming this May.

The company currently has two dozen employees and operates in 12 countries, working on everything from connecting the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo to augmenting the congested network at the 2024 Coachella festival.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve realised over time that for a good number of the things we create, there‚Äôs a lot of benefit to landing just outside of the Alphabet membrane,‚Äù said Eric ‚ÄúAstro‚Äù Teller, X‚Äôs so-called captain of moonshots. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to be able to get connected quickly to market capital, bring in strategic investors and generally be able to scale faster this way.‚Äù

Taara‚Äôs current tech involves firing a narrow beam of light from one traffic light-sized terminal to another, with transmission of up to 20 gigabits per second over 20km (almost 12.5 miles) distances. The terminals can be mounted on towers, and are quicker and cheaper to install than laying fiber ‚Äî especially when you need a signal to reach an island, cross a river, or arrive at some otherwise hard-to-reach location. Last month the company announced that it has condensed its tech into a much more compact chip, which it expects to launch in a product in 2026.

While Taara‚Äôs tower-based optical technology works differently to Starlink‚Äôs satellites, it‚Äôs setting itself up as a rival in the business of connecting rural areas. ‚ÄúWe can offer 10, if not 100 times more bandwidth to an end user than a typical Starlink antenna, and do it for a fraction of the cost,‚Äù founder Mahesh Krishnaswamy told Wired.

Taara itself has its origins in another X project, Loon, which imagined distributing data by shooting lasers around a network of 20-mile-high balloons. Believe it or not, that proved unfeasible in the end, and Loon was wound down in 2021 ‚Äî just three years after it too ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù from Alphabet‚Äôs moonshot program. Loon‚Äôs lasers were repurposed into Taara‚Äôs towers by Krishnaswamy, though the tech also found a third home in Aalyria, another spin-off that focuses on coordinating satellite and airborne mesh networks, and has its own Tightbeam project that sounds similar to Taara.",theverge

https://theverge.com,Trump says Biden pardons are ‚Äòvoid‚Äô because they were signed by autopen,https://theverge.com/news/631214/biden-autopen-void-trump-claim-truth-social,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:19:05 GMT","In a post on Truth Social overnight, President Donald Trump claims that some pardons by President Joe Biden are ‚ÄúVOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT,‚Äù saying an autopen was used to forge the former president‚Äôs signature.

Trump alluded specifically to Biden‚Äôs pardons for members of the House January 6th Committee, claiming that the pardon signatures had been ‚Äúdone by Autopen‚Äù and that Biden ‚Äúknew nothing about them.‚Äù He added that ‚Äúthe people that did may have committed a crime.‚Äù However, the president offered no evidence that Biden was unaware of the pardon or that an autopen ‚Äî a robotic device that mechanically copies a signature ‚Äî had been used.

Trump‚Äôs post echoes claims made last week by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which alleged that Biden‚Äôs signature on several pardons was identical, implying the use of an autopen. The New York Post further claimed that a Biden aide ‚Äúmade unilateral determinations‚Äù to sign documents using an autopen. The idea that Biden was unaware of these pardons, however, is contradicted by his public statements about them. In a January 20th statement on pardoning January 6th Committee staff and others, Biden said that although he felt that the recipients would ‚Äúultimately be exonerated,‚Äù investigations of them could ‚Äúirreparably damage‚Äù their reputations and finances.

In the years since losing the 2020 election to Biden, Trump has vowed political revenge multiple times. Before the Supreme Court issued its decision on presidential immunity, he told Time that depending on that decision, ‚ÄúBiden, I am sure, will be prosecuted for all of his crimes.‚Äù As an NPR story last year describes, Trump has said similar things about Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as Liz Cheney, who served as the vice chair of the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack. His new Truth Social post, similarly, claims ‚Äúthose on the Unselect Committee‚Äù are ‚Äúsubject to investigation at the highest level.‚Äù

Presidents and other politicians have long used autopens to sign documents, with President Gerald Ford having been among the first to admit to its use. President Barack Obama signed a bill remotely with an autopen in 2011, pointing to a Bush White House legal team memo that said the president could sign something ‚Äúby directing another to affix one‚Äôs name or seal to the document in one‚Äôs presence.‚Äù As Bloomberg notes, the Justice Department also held in 1929 that ‚Äúneither the Constitution nor statute prescribed the method by which executive clemency shall be exercised or evidenced. It is wholly for the president to decide.‚Äù",theverge

Google is shipping the latest ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù features of its Gemini 2.0 Flash AI model to more developers across all regions, and people are finding some concerning abilities that include editing out watermarks from photos.

The company‚Äôs lightweight localized on-device AI model is now equipped with native image generation that can not only produce pictures from a text prompt but also let you conversationally edit images. Over the weekend, users found that it can also remove watermarks with precision, TechCrunch reports.

Tools like Watermark Remover.io can already scrub marks from companies like Shutterstock, and a research team at Google built a watermark removal algorithm in 2017 to highlight the need for more secure protections. Conversely, some AI tools ‚Äî like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o ‚Äî will refuse requests to remove them.

Gemini 2.0 Flash, however, seems to be better than other options at removing complex watermarks like Getty Images stamps and filling in the image. After it removes the watermark, it will add a SynthID mark, effectively replacing a copyright mark with an ‚Äúedited with AI‚Äù one. But it‚Äôs possible to remove AI marks using AI, too, as we‚Äôve seen before with Samsung‚Äôs object erase tool.

Users also noted that Gemini 2.0 Flash could apparently add recognizable images of real people like Elon Musk into photos, something that the full Gemini model doesn‚Äôt allow.

Flash‚Äôs latest image features are only available for developers through AI Studio for now ‚Äî so its apparent lack of guardrails isn‚Äôt quite open for everyone to use (or abuse).

Frida Baby is upgrading a popular tool designed to help relieve an infant‚Äôs congestion with more power. The company says it sells over 4.7 million of its manual SnotSuckers every year, but for parents who are too grossed out at the thought of manually sucking snot out of a sick infant‚Äôs nose, the new $79.97 Electric NoseFrida Pro nasal aspirator does it automatically and more powerfully than the company‚Äôs other electric option.

The Verge‚Äôs Allison Johnson has already thoroughly explained why sucking snot out of a baby or toddler‚Äôs nose is as important a task as it is an unpleasant one. A stuffed-up nose is not just uncomfortable for a child; it can also make it hard for them to eat, drink, and sleep.

The NoseFrida SnotSucker comes highly recommended in parenting communities, but it‚Äôs a finicky device that requires a lot of manual suction and ‚Äî more often than not ‚Äî two adults to get the job done. The company already offers an easier-to-use electric version for $39.99, and other companies sell similar products. But Frida Baby says its new ENF Pro introduces two additional levels of suction power comparable to ‚Äúhospital-grade neonatal aspirators.‚Äù

A carrying case is included, and while the ENF Pro charges over USB-C, you‚Äôll need to provide your own AC adapter. Image: Frida Baby

Frida Baby hasn‚Äôt shared details on how much suction that actually equates to, but Dr. Noze Best, a company that also sells a hospital-grade solution, says the suction strength of its NozeBot is 585 mmHg, while devices like breast pumps are closer to 270 mmHg. What sets the ENF Pro apart from the NozeBot is that it‚Äôs an FDA-approved medical device that ‚Äúmeets stricter standards for safety and effectiveness than typical consumer-grade aspirators,‚Äù according to the company.

The Electric NoseFrida Pro includes two swappable tips designed for infants and older children. Image: Frida Baby

The process of clearing a congested infant‚Äôs nose can be stressful, especially for new parents when a child is already crying. To ease some of the discomfort of the process, the ENF Pro includes a soft tip that‚Äôs gentler for smaller noses, and a more rigid alternative that offers improved suction for older kids. An added finger loop facilitates one-handed operation, and all the parts that actually come into contact with nasal passages and snot can be washed in the dishwasher, so cleanup is mostly hands-off.

Friday Baby says the ENF Pro can run for up to two hours on its rechargeable battery but doesn‚Äôt specify if that‚Äôs at full power or using one of the lower options of its five variable suction settings. It charges using the included USB-C cable, but you‚Äôll need to provide an AC adapter or some other source of USB power.",theverge

If EVs and their ginormous batteries are expensive, resource-intensive purchases, the thinking went, maybe we should get something more out of them than just groceries and school pick-ups. Maybe we could find other things for that huge battery to do during the 95 percent of time it spends parked in or near our homes.

An EV powering your whole home, or even pushing power back to the grid, is something higher-end EVs might do at some point with some utilities. I have a Chevy Bolt, an EV that does not have even a three-prong 110 V plug on it, let alone power-your-home potential. If I wanted to keep the essentials running during an outage, it seemed like I needed to buy a fuel-based generator‚Äîor one of those big portable power stations.

Or so I thought, until I came across inverter kits. Inverters take the direct current available from your vehicle's 12V battery‚Äîthe lead-acid brick inside almost every car‚Äîand turns it into alternating current suitable for standard plugs. Inverters designed for car batteries have been around a long time, opening up both novel and emergency uses. The catch is that you have to start the car's gas engine often enough to keep the battery charged.

What's different about this Bolt-specific kit is that the inverter pulls power from the 12 V battery, which in turn pulls from the car's larger battery, the high-voltage one that makes it actually drive. And given that it's an EV without emissions, it's OK to keep it running in the garage. It's by no means a whole-home solution‚Äîmy kit maker, EV Extend, recommends drawing just 1,000 watts of continuous power so as not to drain the battery too far or damage the electronics. But it's certainly better than having only flashlights, USB battery packs, and the power utility's website open on your phone.",arstechnica

According to revenue data from ""over 75,000"" mobile apps, the vast majority have a hard time making $1,000 per month.

The data is detailed in RevenueCat's 2025 State of Subscription Apps report. RevenueCat makes a mobile app subscription tool kit and gathered the report's data from apps using its platform. The report covers ""more than $10 billion in revenue across more than a billion transactions,"" and RevenueCat's customer base ranges from indie-sized teams to large publishers. Buffer, ChatGPT, FC Barcelona, Goodnotes, and Reuters are among the San Francisco-based firm's customer base.

Additionally, the report examines apps that rely primarily on in-app subscriptions, as well as those that only generate some revenue from subscriptions. All apps examined, though, actively generate subscription revenue and ""meet a minimum threshold of installs or revenue (to ensure statistically meaningful findings,"" according to the report.

RevenueCat's report doesn't cover every single mobile app available, but it paints a picture of the challenges related to monetizing mobile apps across different types of categories, as well as how uneven the distribution of app revenue is.

A strenuous road to $1,000

RevenueCat's report concluded that most apps fail to make $1,000 in monthly revenue within their first two years. It says:

Across all categories, nearly 20 percent reach $1,000 in revenue, while 5 percent reach the $10,000 mark. Revenue drop-off is steep, with many categories losing ~50 percent of apps at each milestone, emphasizing the challenge of sustained growth beyond early revenue benchmarks.

Credit: RevenueCat

Some app categories with the smallest percentage of newly launched apps hitting the $1,000 mark are shopping, travel, and utilities. Photo, video, and gaming apps are the most likely to hit $1,000/month within two years.

The good news is that apps that do eventually make it to $1,000 in monthly revenue tend to do so rather quickly. The median number of days it takes for an app to reach $1,000/month in revenue is 60 days, RevenueCat found. But as the chart below shows, that stat varies based on the type of app. Education apps, for example, have a median of 79 days. Meanwhile, lofty monthly revenue goals of $10,000/month are especially hard to reach for shopping and travel apps.",arstechnica

UK's Online Safety Act (OSA) forces tech companies to detect and remove dangerous online content, threatening fines of up to 10 percent of global turnover. In extreme cases, widely used platforms like Musk's X could be shut down or executives even jailed if UK online safety regulator Ofcom determines there has been a particularly egregious violation.

Critics call it a censorship bill, listing over 130 ""priority"" offenses across 17 categories detailing what content platforms must remove. The list includes illegal content connected to terrorism, child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, illegal drugs, animal welfare, and other crimes. But it also broadly restricts content in legally gray areas, like posts considered ""extreme pornography,"" harassment, or controlling behavior.

Matthew Lesh, a public policy fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs, told The Telegraph that ""the idea that Elon Musk, or any social media executive, could be jailed for failing to remove enough content should send chills down the spine of anyone who cares about free speech.""

Musk has publicly signaled that he expects Trump to intervene, saying, ""Thank goodness Donald Trump will be president just in time,"" regarding the OSA's enforcement starting in March, The Telegraph reported last month. The X owner has been battling UK regulators since last summer after resisting requests from the UK government to remove misinformation during riots considered the ""worst unrest in England for more than a decade,"" The Financial Times reported.

According to Musk, X was refusing to censor UK users. Attacking the OSA, Musk falsely claimed Prime Minister Keir Starmer‚Äôs government was ""releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts,"" FT reported. Such a post, if seen as spreading misinformation potentially inciting violence, could be banned under the OSA, the FT suggested.

Google is already dismantling Assistant as it switches to Gemini.,https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/why-wait-google-is-already-dismantling-assistant-as-it-switches-to-gemini/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:06:06 GMT","Google Assistant is not long for this world. Google confirmed what many suspected last week, that it will transition everyone to Gemini in 2025. Assistant holdouts may find it hard to stay on Google's old system until the end, though. Google has confirmed some popular Assistant features are being removed in the coming weeks. You may not miss all of them, but others could force a change to your daily routine.

As Google has increasingly become totally consumed by Gemini, it was a foregone conclusion that Assistant would get the ax eventually. In 2024, Google removed features like media alarms and voice messages, but that was just the start. The full list of removals is still available on its support page (spotted by 9to5Google), but there's now a new batch of features at the top. Here's a rundown of what's on the chopping block.

Favorite, share, and ask where and when your photos were taken with your voice

Change photo frame settings or ambient screen settings with your voice

Translate your live conversation with someone who doesn‚Äôt speak your language with interpreter mode

Get birthday reminder notifications as part of Routines

Ask to schedule or hear previously scheduled Family Bell announcements

Get daily updates from your Assistant, like ‚Äúsend me the weather everyday‚Äù

Use Google Assistant on car accessories that have a Bluetooth connection or AUX plug

Some of these are no great loss‚Äîyou'll probably live without the ability to get automatic birthday reminders or change smart display screensavers by voice. However, others are popular features that Google has promoted aggressively. For example, interpreter mode made a splash in 2019 and has been offering real-time translations ever since; Assistant can only translate a single phrase now. Many folks also use the scheduled updates in Assistant as part of their morning routine. Family Bell is much beloved, too, allowing Assistant to make custom announcements and interactive checklists, which can be handy for getting kids going in the morning. Attempting to trigger some of these features will offer a warning that they will go away soon.",arstechnica

Held on the roads around a lake in Albert Park, the track is one of F1's trickier challenges, made more so on Sunday thanks to rain that eased off before the start of the race, only to return with a vengeance a dozen or so laps before the end. It proved to be a tough day for four of the sport's six new drivers, as well as some more well-known names, and it gave us a clearer idea of the pecking order between the teams, at least for now.

True F1 junkies were probably following the preseason test earlier this month in Bahrain, as the sport now helpfully shows those three days of running on its streaming platform. But those devoted enough to watch the cars circulate for hours with nothing on the line also know you shouldn't read too much into a preseason test, especially one held at a circuit that is unrepresentative of most of the others that F1 visits‚Äîand in unseasonably cold weather, to boot.

Little has changed in the way of the technical regulations between the end of last year and the start of this one, other than an increasing scrutiny on the front and rear wings' ability to flex when they're not supposed to. Flexing or deflecting under load at opportune times reduces the drag and allows a car to go a little faster in a straight line for the same amount of power, giving that car an unfair advantage.

It looked as if McLaren would be starting the season off with the fastest car and that both Williams and Alpine tested well, but with no way to know how heavy or light any of the cars were running, it was less clear how to sort the field properly.",arstechnica
https://arstechnica.com,Physicists unlock another clue to brewing the perfect espresso,https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/the-physics-of-brewing-the-perfect-espresso/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:30:46 GMT","Many variables can affect the quality of a steaming cup of espresso, including so-called ""channeling"" during the brewing process, in which the water doesn't seep uniformly through the grounds but branches off in various preferential paths instead. This significantly reduces the extraction yield and thus the quality of the final brew. Scientists from the University of Warsaw have gleaned insights into the underlying physics of channeling that will help coffee lovers achieve more consistent results when brewing espresso. They presented their preliminary findings at the American Physical Society's Global Physics Summit in Anaheim, California, this morning.

As previously reported, there's an official industry standard for brewing espresso, courtesy of the Specialty Coffee Association, which sets out strict guidelines for its final volume (25‚Äì35 mL, or roughly 1 ounce) and preparation. The water must be heated to 92¬∞ to 95¬∞C (197¬∞ to 203¬∞F) and forced (at a specific pressure) through a bed of 7 to 9 grams (about a quarter of an ounce) of finely ground coffee for 20 to 30 seconds. But most coffee shops don't follow this closely, as the brewing machines allow baristas to configure water pressure, temperature, and other key variables to their liking. The result of all those variations in technique is a great deal of variability in quality and taste.

Naturally, scientists find this fascinating. For instance, in 2020, Christopher Hendon's lab at the University of Oregon helped devise a mathematical model for brewing the perfect cup of espresso over and over while minimizing waste. Hendon is a computational materials chemist, and his lab holds regular coffee hours for the Eugene campus community. The researchers focused on an easily measurable property known as the extraction yield (EY): the fraction of coffee that dissolves into the final beverage. That, in turn, depends on controlling water flow and pressure as the liquid percolates through the coffee grounds.

Hendon et al. based their model on how lithium ions propagate through a battery's electrodes, akin to how caffeine molecules dissolve from coffee grounds. They concluded that the most reproducible thing you can do is use fewer coffee beans and opt for a coarser grind with a bit less water; brew time was largely irrelevant.",arstechnica

Taara is the latest project to spring from X‚ÄîAlphabet‚Äôs experimental hub that produced AI lab Google Brain and Waymo‚Äôs self-driving cars‚Äîand has its origins in a concept called Loon. That envisaged shooting beams of light between thousands of balloons floating on the edge of space to provide phone and Internet services across remote areas.

Loon was wound up in 2021 due to the political and regulatory hurdles to flying the balloons and the difficulty of servicing the 20-mile-high equipment. However, its lasers found a second life on Taara‚Äôs towers under engineer Mahesh Krishnaswamy.

The technology works by firing a beam of light the width of a pencil from one traffic light-sized terminal to another, using a system of sensors, optics, and mirrors to fix it on a 1.5 inch receiver. Alphabet says the system can transmit data at 20 gigabits per second over 20 km, extending traditional fibre-optics networks with minimal construction and lower costs.

Based in Sunnyvale near Google‚Äôs headquarters in Mountain View, California, Taara has two dozen staff and is hiring aggressively. The start-up has secured backing from Series X Capital, and Alphabet will retain a minority stake, but the company refused to disclose any details about its seed funding or financial targets.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve realized over time that for a good number of the things we create, there‚Äôs a lot of benefit to landing just outside of the Alphabet membrane,‚Äù said Eric ‚ÄúAstro‚Äù Teller, X‚Äôs captain of moonshots. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to be able to get connected quickly to market capital, bring in strategic investors, and generally be able to scale faster this way.‚Äù

Taara already operates in 12 countries including India and parts of Africa. It has created a 5 km laser link over the Congo River between Brazzaville and Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo where Internet costs are much higher. It also supplements overloaded mobile phone networks at events such as the Coachella music festival in California.",arstechnica

Ars does not accept paid editorial content.

SAN FRANCISCO‚ÄîNewsflash: The new electric Cadillac Escalade IQ weighs over 9,000 lbs, or a fair amount more than 4,000 kilograms. For context, that figure works out to almost exactly half again as much as the 682 hp (509 kW) Escalade V that comes equipped with a barking-mad 6.2 L supercharged V8. Yet the latest and supposedly greatest from Cadillac needed to weigh so very much to achieve a class-leading range target of 460 miles (740 km), thanks to a 205 kWh battery pack.

The Escalade IQ shares a modular General Motors (formerly Ultium) chassis and battery pack with the gargantuan Hummer EV, and even more hardware with the Silverado and Sierra pickup truck siblings. As opposed to trying to attract rugged work truck and off-roading cred, though, for Cadillac that kind of range figure seemed necessary to appeal to a ""no compromise"" lifestyle that Escalade buyers might well expect while considering a switch to fully electric power.

And the new IQ certainly puts down plenty of instantaneously available grunt, and despite its mass, it can punch out a 0‚Äì60 time in under five seconds with the Velocity Max button pushed, thanks to dual motors rated at 750 hp (560 kW) and 786 lb-ft (1,065 Nm).

Three rows of seats will comfortably seat seven adults, and a forthcoming EQL variant stretches just over 4 inches longer with a higher roofline to create even more space in the third row. The rest of the interior, meanwhile, packs in all the tech possible: almost six feet of screens atop the dash, up to 42 speakers' worth of surround sound, optional Executive second-row seats with massaging function, hands-free Super Cruise partially automated driving, and the list goes on.

We know by now that electrification fits well into the super-luxe ethos, because silent and smooth propulsion works better for shorter lifestyle drives. And yet, the sheer mass required to achieve those range and power figures‚Äîdespite improved aero versus the ICE Escalade‚Äîunfortunately means that the laws of physics make no compromises, either.

Specifically, the Escalade IQ rides on the same battery cradle, same suspension components, same 24-inch wheel size, and same Michelin Primacy LTX tires as the Silverado EV RST First Edition‚Äîa behemoth of a pickup truck that many journalists panned due to the baffling decision by General Motors to spec the largest wheels ever sold on a production vehicle.

The first is for Canada to flout U.S. intellectual property law and become a nation that exports jailbreaks. The second is to ban PornHub.

Trump‚Äôs reciprocal tariffs kick in on April 2. If they go through, they‚Äôll disrupt the economies of both nations. Last week Ontario Premiere Doug Ford announced a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the states before ‚Äúsuspending‚Äù it pending negotiations. It‚Äôs hard to know where all this ends up, how nasty it will get, and how much suffering people will endure.

Canadian science fiction writer, tech journalist, and friend of Gizmodo Cory Doctorow had a great suggestion last month that would put incredible pressure on the U.S. ‚ÄúWhat if Canada stopped upholding U.S. tech companies‚Äô intellectual property?‚Äù He asked in a paper for the Canada Centre for Policy Alternatives.

American tech companies charge a lot of rent. Most app stores run by Amazon, Apple, or Google skim 30% off every transaction. John Deere farming equipment is hard to repair without paying the company for expensive software unlocks. Car companies, and especially Tesla, lock basic features behind electronic paywalls.

Doctorow‚Äôs suggestion is that Canada not impose tariffs on U.S. goods but go back through its trade negotiations with America and ‚Äútear up these laws‚Äù that it agreed to regarding big tech‚Äôs IP.

‚ÄúYou know what Canada could make? A Canadian App Store. That‚Äôs a store that Canadian software authors could use to sell Canadian apps to Canadian customers, charging, say, the standard payment processing fee of five per cent rather than Apple‚Äôs 30 per cent. Canada could make app stores for the Android, Playstation and Xbox, too,‚Äù Doctorow said.

He also suggested that the app store shouldn‚Äôt confine itself to Canadian software authors. ‚ÄúCanadian app stores could offer five per cent commissions on sales to U.S. and global software authors, and provide jailbreaking kits that allow device owners all around the world to install the Canadian app stores where software authors don‚Äôt get ripped off by American Big Tech companies.‚Äù That‚Äôs a much better deal than most of us get when we buy something on our phones.

In Doctorow‚Äôs calculation, Canada could manufacture devices and software to help jailbreak John Deere tractors, Teslas, and other American cars. Imagine a world where farmers paid a Canadian company for a software update, one time, instead of constantly returning to John Deere for rent-seeking computer updates. Imagine a world where you paid, once, for a device on your new car that unlocked all its software features forever.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs standing in the way of a Canadian industrial policy that focuses on raiding the sky-high margins of American monopolists with third-party add-ons, mods and jailbreaks?‚Äù Doctorow said.

Another, sillier, suggestion has gone viral thanks to an Instagram reel from Canadian comedian Matthew Puzhitsky: ban PornHub. The pornography giant is based in Montreal and sees millions of American visitors every month. On March 6, Puzhitsky published a skit on Instagram where politicians looking for ways to win the trade war against Canada suggested banning the site.

The skit struck a nerve and has been covered by The New York Post and The Daily Mail. If Canada could ban Pornhub in the States, we win the trade war. That‚Äôs it. There is no trade war,‚Äù Puzhitsky told The Post.

America doesn‚Äôt need the help. PornHub is already banned in 17 states (including Texas, Florida, and more), part of restrictive new laws in conservative parts of the country that force people to show an ID to access adult websites. Rather than comply with a law that is a privacy and technological nightmare, PornHub has blocked access to its services in those states.

https://gizmodo.com,Trump Defies Courts as ‚ÄòRule of Law‚Äô Becomes a Punchline,https://gizmodo.com/trump-defies-courts-as-rule-of-law-becomes-a-punchline-2000576853,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 18:16:06 GMT","President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration defied a federal court order on Saturday to halt deportations of migrants from the U.S. to El Salvador. It‚Äôs not the first time the Trump regime has ignored a court order but the scale and brazenness of the defiance really feels like a turning point for the country. And it‚Äôs unclear whether anything will stop Trump now that the country has reached such a lawless stage.

Trump secretly invoked the Alien Enemies Act on Friday, a law from 1798 that gives the president enormous power in a time of war to deport people without judicial review. The problem, of course, is that the U.S. isn‚Äôt at war. The president insists we are, but simply saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre at war‚Äù because you don‚Äôt like immigrants in some abstract way isn‚Äôt how it‚Äôs done.

After Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, the ACLU sued to stop the deportations, which were already in the process of happening on Saturday. Planes were in the air, and based on the publicly available information, at least some of the people being flown to El Salvador had not been handed over to that country yet when the judge issued his ruling.

Trump alleges most of the people deported this weekend were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. But the fact that these people were deported under the Alien Enemies Act means they didn‚Äôt get a court hearing of any kind. There‚Äôs no way to even know their immigration status, aside from taking the Trump regime‚Äôs word for it. They could‚Äôve been citizens for all we know.

One of the ACLU lawyers working on the case, Lee Gelernt, told MSNBC on Monday that he needs to get answers today to a lot of questions raised by the Trump regime‚Äôs apparent refusal to abide by the court. Gelernt says it doesn‚Äôt matter if the planes were over international waters, one of the arguments the Trump regime is apparently making about why it didn‚Äôt need to adhere to the order.

‚ÄúThe fact that they might have been in international territory makes no difference, because the U.S. had custody of these individuals, and the judge specifically ordered them to be returned,‚Äù Gelernt said.

El Salvador‚Äôs crypto-loving president Nayib Bukele tweeted about the court order early Sunday, sharing a screenshot of an article from the New York Post with a headline reading ‚ÄúFed judge orders deportation flights carrying alleged Venezuelan gangbanger to return to US, blocks Trump from invoking Alien Enemies Act.‚Äù Bukele tweeted, ‚ÄúOoopsi‚Ä¶ Too late,‚Äù along with a crying-laughing emoji.

Bukele later shared that 238 alleged members of Tren de Aragua were sent from the U.S. to El Salvador, transferred to what he calls the CECOT, the Terrorism Confinement Center. Bukele says they‚Äôre being held there for a period of one year that can be renewed. An additional 23 alleged members of MS-13 were also transported there, according to the BBC. And the Salvadoran leader says the U.S. is paying for the country to take all these people to its notoriously brutal prison system.

‚ÄúThe United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us,‚Äù Bukele wrote Sunday. ‚ÄúOver time, these actions, combined with the production already being generated by more than 40,000 inmates engaged in various workshops and labor under the Zero Idleness program, will help make our prison system self-sustainable. As of today, it costs $200 million per year.‚Äù

There are other cases where the Trump administration appears to be defying court orders. Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a 34-year-old doctor, was reportedly detained Thursday at Boston Logan International Airport while flying into the U.S. from Lebanon. Alawieh reportedly held an H-1B visa working at Brown University‚Äôs medical school, according to CNN. And even though a court ordered she not be deported while the case was heard, the Trump regime apparently sent her back to Lebanon anyway.

Lawyers for Alawieh accused Trump‚Äôs Department of Justice of ‚Äúwillfully‚Äù disobeying the court order, as Slate notes, but the official story is that the DOJ did it unintentionally. There was supposed to be a hearing Monday about Alawieh‚Äôs case but it was canceled because lawyers representing her withdrew, though it‚Äôs not clear why. Trump has recently targeted law firms, stripping two firms of security clearances last week.

Trump has made no secret of his fascist intentions for the United States. The president spoke at the Department of Justice on Friday in a particularly unhinged, though not surprising, speech denouncing perceived enemies, referring to them as ‚Äúscum.‚Äù

Trump at the DOJ: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a guy named Norm Eisen. I don‚Äôt even know what he looks like. His name is Norm Eisen of CREW. He‚Äôs been after me for 9 years. Now CREW is a charitable organization. These are bad people ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre scum.‚Äù [image or embed] ‚Äî Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) March 14, 2025 at 1:10 PM

In a late-night post on Truth Social last night Trump declared that President Joe Biden‚Äôs pardons as he was leaving office were ‚Äúvoid‚Äù because they were supposedly signed by auto-pen, a device often used by presidents of all political stripes to sign paperwork. It‚Äôs a ridiculous theory, but it‚Äôs the excuse Trump clearly wants to use to persecute people like former congresswoman Liz Cheney, a Republican who led a congressional investigation into his attempted self-coup on January 6, 2021.

The Trump regime is openly saying the law and the judges who interpret that law don‚Äôt matter anymore. Tom Homan, Trump‚Äôs border czar, appeared on Fox News Monday to say he doesn‚Äôt care what the judges think. He‚Äôs just going to keep doing what he‚Äôs doing.

There are no guardrails anymore. If the U.S. government says you were a member of a violent gang, you have no way to contest that. That‚Äôs exactly why Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act. The courts slow down deportations if you have to actually prove someone is a danger to society. And being a member of a gang isn‚Äôt itself a crime in the U.S., even a historically violent one. People in the U.S. are supposed to be punished for committing acts of violence or, at the very least, for providing material support for those acts.

‚ÄúCongress could not have been [more] clear in the statute that it has to be a foreign government or nation invading or in a declared war with the U.S.‚Äù Gelernt told MSNBC about the Alien Enemies Act. ‚ÄúFundamentally, this is about separation of powers and the Trump administration thumbing their nose at Congress and the courts.‚Äù

A hearing is scheduled for 4 p.m. ET Monday. The ACLU is expected to bring up Bukele‚Äôs ‚Äúoopsie‚Äù tweet, as well as a story published by Axios Sunday that quotes anonymous White House officials.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the showdown that was always going to happen between the two branches of government,‚Äù a senior White House official told Axios. ‚ÄúAnd it seemed that this was pretty clean. You have Venezuelan gang members ‚Ä¶ These are bad guys, as the president would say.‚Äù

And that gets to the heart of the problem. Trump is clearly starting with the people he believes will elicit little or no sympathy, even if they‚Äôre not actually gang members. Declaring them enemies is typically enough for Americans to believe they must be the bad guys.

Lindsay Toczylowski, an attorney for one of the people deported, wrote on Bluesky that her client was only singled out because he has tattoos and is not a member of a gang.

‚ÄúOur client worked in the arts in Venezuela. He is LGBTQ. His tattoos are benign. But ICE submitted photos of his tattoos as evidence he is Tren de Aragua,‚Äù Toczylowski wrote. ‚ÄúHis @ImmDef attorney planned to present evidence he is not. But never got the chance because our client has been disappeared.‚Äù

The Texas Department of Public Safety guide on how to spot gang tattoos certainly raises more questions than it answers.

Unfortunately, it seems like things will only get dumber and more fascist from here.",gizmodo

Evan Feinman, who directed the program for the last three years, wrote in a departing email to staff that Starlink‚Äôs satellite internet is ‚Äúinferior‚Äù to alternatives, ‚Äúdelivering slower speeds at higher costs to the household paying the bill.‚Äù

Elon Musk, along with Republications, has vociferously attacked the rural broadband program launched under President Biden, called the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment Program (BEAD). Three years after launch, no internet expansion projects have begun with the program‚Äôs $42.5 billion in funding, though three states were awaiting final approvals just as President Trump took office. Musk has regularly used X to lambast the program, of course, while pushing his own Starlink service.

Howard Lutnick, the new Commerce Secretary, has said the agency would review BEAD and remove burdensome requirements that have slowed down deployment as well as, crucially, eliminate any preference for fiber.

‚ÄúShovels could already be in the ground in three states, and they could be in the ground in half the country by the summer without the proposed changes to project selection,‚Äù Feinman wrote in his email, adding these states should be allowed to move forward with their plans while program changes remain in flux. Internet access, being just about as important as other basic necessities, is considered by many a utility today, but internet providers have not had much incentive to expand into rural areas that would be less profitable. BEAD was meant to address this with subsidies and incentives.

Starlink is fast to deploy to households, as it only requires customers order a satellite dish from SpaceX, with installation completed in minutes. Broadband fiber, conversely, is labor-intensive and costly to deploy as it requires physically laying cable on power lines and into every home. Starlink can offer some impressive speeds in the range of hundreds of megabits, but typically not the 1 Gbps (1,000 megabits) or more offered by fiber optic, and latency is an issue given the limitations of sending signals to and from space.

SpaceX may not need to lay cable, but must continuously launch new satellites into space as the old ones reach end-of-life, and the company is limited by regulators in how many it can place in orbit. Competition from Amazon and others is on the horizon, but has been slow-going.

Starlink is generally more expensive than broadband fiber. The satellite dish itself costs $349 (sans promotions), with service typically going for $120 per month. Feinman argues that while fiber might be more expensive to deploy upfront, households will be left with faster and more affordable internet service for years to come.

Elon Musk himself said from the early days that Starlink would never replace fiber broadband for those who already have it, as the service inherently has limitations that ground-based infrastructure does not. The service is a good option for remote areas without access to fiber, and SpaceX has partnered with cruise and airline operators to offer internet in moving vehicles. Starlink is good if it is the only option. If the government supports the development of broadband in rural areas, however, it would make Starlink a harder sell. By potentially eliminating the program‚Äôs preference for fiber, states might be pushed to adopt Starlink for its lower roll-out cost.

‚ÄúReach out to your congressional delegation and reach out to the Trump Administration and tell them to strip out the needless requirements, but not to strip away from states the flexibility to get the best connections for their people,‚Äù Feinman wrote.

Musk has claimed that he has not used his newfound influence in Washington for financial gain or self-dealing. Tesla sales might be falling precipitously due to his divisive brand, but President Trump recently ran a promotion for Tesla on the White House lawn. And at SpaceX, deals to replace other internet providers in government agencies seem to be moving apace. The FAA is reportedly looking to cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon in favor of Starlink.

Unfortunately for those in rural America, it looks like they may soon be forced to pay more for less because Musk has been able to use X as his megaphone to push his agenda and intimidate any Republicans who do not go his way.",gizmodo

Has Pulled All of Classic Looney Tunes From Max,https://gizmodo.com/looney-tunes-removed-max-streaming-warner-bros-2000576752,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 14:00:27 GMT","That‚Äôs all, folks‚Äìas parent company Warner Bros.‚Äô valuation of animation continues to be in rapid descent, the company has decided that the same weekend the Looney Tunes light up the big screen in The Day the Earth Blew Up would be the perfect time to remove every original Looney Tunes short from its streamer, Max.

Deadline reports that the removal‚Äìwhich impacts almost 40 years‚Äô worth of animated shorts from the 1930s all the way up to the late ‚Äô60s‚Äìis part of an ongoing reprioritization on Max to focus on adult and family content. While plenty of Looney Tunes series remain on the streamer for now such as The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, parts of New Looney Tunes, and Tiny Toons Looniversity, the franchise‚Äôs classic legacy of short form animation has been scrubbed entirely, coming even after Warner Bros. previously clarified plans not to remove the original shorts from Max in late 2023.

It‚Äôs not the first time in recent memory that Warner Bros. has come under fire for how it‚Äôs treating the studio‚Äôs animated legacy. At the end of September 2024, Warner Bros. confirmed that it would shutter its classic-animation-focused streaming platform Boomerang entirely, and came under fire when it completely scrubbed the beloved Cartoon Network website of years of history to replace it with a landing page directing people to subscribe to Max‚Äìcutting off generations of flash games as well as free online access to a host of episodes from contemporary and recent series.

But the move is also just the latest in an oddball relationship Warner Bros. has had with the Looney Tunes franchise in particular. The timing of Looney Tunes‚Äò animated origins being dropped from Max comes right as the franchise makes its long-overdue fully animated theatrical debut in The Day the Earth Blew Up‚Äìa release itself that Warner Bros. distanced itself from, first ordering the film for Max as a streaming original, and then selling the film to Ketchup Entertainment outside the American theater market for release after priorities shifted again. It also, of course, comes after the debacle that was Warner‚Äôs handling of live-action hybrid Coyote vs. Acme, shelved for a $70 million tax write-off amid reports that the studio allegedly obfuscated attempts to get the movie sold to other distributors.

Time will tell just how things between Warner and one of its most legendary animated franchises continue to develop, especially while Day the Earth Blew Up remains in theaters. After that brief bright spot, who knows what‚Äôs next after this?",gizmodo

The model is currently in its ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù phase, and only available to developers.

A slew of apps that are capable of removing objects from photos and filling in the gaps are already available. Newer generative AI models have made them even more capable, and companies like Adobe have been adding updated object-removal tools to their photo editors. Apple Intelligence includes a tool called ‚ÄúClean up‚Äù on iOS and macOS that enables this for supported devices.

The post below on X shows how well Gemini Flash 2.0 is at removing objects.

New skill unlocked: Gemini 2 Flash model is really awesome at removing watermarks in images! pic.twitter.com/6QIk0FlfCv ‚Äî Deedy (@deedydas) March 15, 2025

Major closed models from the likes of Google and OpenAI are typically ‚Äúnerfed,‚Äù meaning they have significant restrictions in place to avoid legal trouble. The latter‚Äôs Dall-E image model will not generate images of copyrighted characters, for instance. Microsoft recently sued a group of individuals who managed to trick its image models into generating porn. Do not fear, /r/photoshoprequest, as Google will almost certainly attempt to reign in watermark removals.

As some have noted, it is likely impossible to put the cat back in the bag completely on this one, as open models have safety guardrails that can be disabled. But by demonstrating that it is putting in effort to prevent misuse, Google protects itself from legal responsibility. Even open models can come with license agreements, and of course, law enforcement and courts can stop abuses.

One funny thing to note in the case of the watermark removal is that Google‚Äôs model adds its own watermark to images modified or generated by AI, so as to make it clear to viewers that it is not genuine. It could be described as an allegory of AI itself: Take something owned by someone else, strip any proof of ownership, and then add your own identifying mark.",gizmodo

Despite delays en route to theaters, fans were eagerly anticipating Bong Joon Ho‚Äôs follow-up to his Oscar-winning triumph Parasite, especially since it was a sci-fi tale starring various versions of Robert Pattinson. When Mickey 17 arrived on March 7, however, audiences and critics alike were surprised by a film that had some fun elements but ultimately felt weighed down by political metaphor.

And it didn‚Äôt exactly set the box office on fire. After Mickey 17‚Äòs tepid opening weekend, Variety reported that ‚Äúthe goofy sci-fi comedy ignited to $24 million overseas and more than $50 million globally, a decent start for an original film in the current theatrical landscape. It just cost way too much to ever turn a profit in this lifetime.‚Äù

The trade once again offered praise‚Äî‚ÄùIt‚Äôs an impressive launch for a fresh, offbeat space odyssey about a disposable employee whose body is able to regenerate for science‚Äù‚Äîbut then pointed out the film‚Äôs oversized budget ($118 million, plus $80 million on marketing) means it ‚Äúneeds to earn around $275 million to $300 million globally to get into the black during its big screen run.‚Äù

That hasn‚Äôt happened; according to Box Office Mojo, the most recent total for Mickey 17 is just over $90 million worldwide. Again, not bad for quirky sci-fi, but not enough to recoup all the money that‚Äôs already been spent.

It‚Äôs not surprising then that rumors have begun to circulate that Mickey 17 will arrive on streaming soon, with March 25 being named as a possible date. Warner Bros. hasn‚Äôt responded to io9‚Äôs query, so that detail remains unofficial and unconfirmed. Movie fans have, however, noticed a trend of under-performing theatrical releases hitting streaming sooner and sooner; to name one notable recent example, Lionsgate‚Äôs Borderlands made us go ‚Äúyikes!‚Äù when it arrived on digital just three weeks after opening in theaters.

Mickey 17 could certainly prove to be more of an at-home hit than it was on the big screen, and that could end up tipping the budget scales in its favor. But perhaps at this point your choice is even more crystal clear: pick up Edward Ashton‚Äôs fantastic source-material novel, Mickey7, which was released in 2022. It even has a sequel, Antimatter Blues. Though the book has fewer replications of the title character, hence the lower number in the title, it doesn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúis this character supposed to be Trump?‚Äù intrusions, and is instead a gripping, wryly funny sci-fi mystery. As an added bonus you can also imagine the main character‚Äôs voice to‚Ä¶ not be what Pattinson went with in Mickey17.",gizmodo

That‚Äôs right. A new investigation of the Iguanidae family tree‚Äîa tree that includes some 2,100 reptilian species, from the marine iguanas of the Galapagos to chameleons of the tropics and chuckwallas of the desert‚Äîindicates that Fiji iguanas are most closely related to lizards in the American Southwest.

Given the vast geographic distance between the two but their relative genetic proximity, a team of researchers concludes that, in the ancient past, a group of desert reptiles hitched a ride on floating debris and never looked back‚Äîsomehow making it to Fiji and surviving there for about 34 million years. The team‚Äôs research was published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

‚ÄúThe lineage of Fiji iguanas split from their sister lineage relatively recently, much closer to 30 million years ago, either post-dating or at about the same time that there was volcanic activity that could have produced land,‚Äù said Simon Scarpetta, a herpetologist and paleontologist at the University of San Francisco and lead author of the paper, in a University of California, Berkeley release.

‚ÄúThe probable mechanism of dispersal was rafting on a vegetation mat, so iguanas that voyaged from North America to Fiji could have had food from the raft itself on their journey across the Pacific,‚Äù Scarpetta told Gizmodo in an email. ‚ÄúThey were also likely resilient to the conditions they faced on the way, such as lack of standing water and high temperatures.‚Äù As for timeline, Scarpetta said previous estimates for a trans-Pacific journey were between 4 to 12 months, though more recent simulations suggested a timeline of 2.5 to 4 months.

That commute would be the longest-known transoceanic dispersal of a terrestrial vertebrate‚Äîan oddly specific record, but one that speaks to the superlative nature of the finding.

If the team‚Äôs conclusions are correct, the ancestors of Fiji iguanas schlepped a staggering 5,000 miles (8,047 kilometers) from western North America to Fiji, riding on vegetative flotsam, fortuitous ocean currents, and a dream. That commute would be the longest-known transoceanic dispersal of a terrestrial vertebrate‚Äîan oddly specific record, but one that speaks to the superlative nature of the finding.

‚ÄúIguanas and desert iguanas, in particular, are resistant to starvation and dehydration, so my thought process is, if there had to be any group of vertebrate or any group of lizard that really could make an 8,000 kilometer journey across the Pacific on a mass of vegetation, a desert iguana-like ancestor would be the one,‚Äù Scarpetta said.

A genetic analysis of more than 4,000 iguana genes, taken from more than 200 specimens of the lizards, revealed the Fiji iguana‚Äôs closest relatives: the North American desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis).

Because Fiji‚Äôs islands formed about 34 million years ago, and based on the timing of the Fiji iguanas‚Äô genetic divergence from the North American desert iguanas, the researchers think the lizards arrived on the island in the last 30-odd-million years.

‚ÄúThat they reached Fiji directly from North America seems crazy,‚Äù said co-author Jimmy McGuire, a herpetologist at UC Berkeley, in the same release, ‚ÄúBut alternative models involving colonization from adjacent land areas don‚Äôt really work for the time frame, since we know that they arrived in Fiji within the last 34 million years or so.‚Äù

The notion that iguanas floated from elsewhere to the islands of the South Pacific has previously been, erm, floated. But the new research effectively rules out a South American origin for the Pacific iguanas, as well as the notion that the reptiles evolved from an older lineage that was widespread in the Pacific before going extinct.

‚ÄúOne question worth pointing out regarding our study, though it would be difficult to test, is whether iguanas hopped across islands in the Pacific from North America to Fiji, rather than rafting in a single event,‚Äù Scarpetta added. ‚ÄúThis is an intriguing possibility, though no fossils of Fijian iguanas are known from anywhere in the Pacific besides Fiji and Tonga, and volcanic islands, of which there are many in the Pacific, can be ephemeral.‚Äù

Despite being isolated on remote islands, the four species of iguana on Fiji and Tonga are endangered due to a combination of habitat loss, predation, and the exotic pet trade. The new research is a reminder of the pains living things have endured to survive, and gives us another reason to conserve the animals that have made it to today.",gizmodo

On Monday, the company announced that it will launch a new prediction hub in its app that will allow people to ‚Äútrade on the outcomes of some of the world‚Äôs biggest events,‚Äù which is apparently distinct from gambling in some way.

Per Robinhood‚Äôs press release the predictions hub will launch with the ability for people to ‚Äútrade contracts‚Äù on what they believe will be the upper bound of the target interest rate the Federal Reserve will announce in May. It‚Äôll also launch with the ability to predict the outcomes of the upcoming March Madness tournament, with both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs brackets available.

While the hub will live in the Robinhood app, the ‚Äúcontracts‚Äù are being made available by Kalshi, which is technically a federally regulated exchange under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission‚Äîbut has also drawn ire from that very same agency for allowing people to bet on the outcome of elections. Shortly before Trump took office, the CFTC accused Kalshi‚Äôs election contracts of being a ‚ÄúTrojan horse to facilitate Kalshi‚Äôs transformation into a large-scale election gambling market.‚Äù

But don‚Äôt worry, Kalshi has quelled those fears by‚Ä¶adding Donald Trump, Jr. to its board of advisers. So, less ‚Äúaddressed outstanding concerns about unregulated gambling‚Äù and more ‚Äúbuddied up to the kid of the president,‚Äù but you know, same outcome!

Robinhood has tried to get into the predictions game before. It allowed people to bet on the outcome of the presidential election, which drew criticism from lawmakers for failing to offer sufficient protections for users who were being exposed to speculative ‚Äúinvesting.‚Äù The company tried to get in on the Super Bowl, too, but pulled back after the CFTC asked it to hold its horses. That, too stemmed from Kalshi, which was the exchange offering the contracts that Robinhood allowed its users to buy‚Äîbut that seems to have resolved itself, as new CFTC acting Chairman Caroline Pham signaled these contracts will be allowed under the new administration.

If you‚Äôre wondering what the difference between futures contracts tied to the outcome of things like elections and sporting events and gambling is, join the club. The whole argument here appears to be that you aren‚Äôt betting on odds set by a bookmaker but are instead purchasing a ‚Äúderivatives contract‚Äù tied to the outcome of a specific event. That apparently makes it an investment and not a bet.

A federal judge has upheld the legality of this kind of ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù despite objections of the previous administration‚Äôs CFTC, so it seems like Robinhood probably has a green light here. For the time being, with the Peter Thiel-backed Polymarket still technically illegal in the US, it also has a pretty strong hold on the market.

Surely there is no social commentary to be found in the fact that the service that is supposedly ‚Äúdemocratizing finance‚Äù (please do not bring up the time it literally stopped retail traders from purchasing or selling certain stocks because it was costing the wrong people money) is rapidly devolving into a platform for purely volatile and speculative ‚Äúassets‚Äù like crypto and events predictions.

That original film stood out among the early 2000s teen-horror craze, providing gruesomely creative death scenes that spiral from the idea that the killer isn‚Äôt a masked slasher‚Äîit‚Äôs Death itself, chasing after people who dodged their intended moment of demise. In a new oral history, the series‚Äô creators look back on the film‚Äôs origins, including more details about something that‚Äôs a well-known part of its history: its ties to The X-Files.

Speaking to Variety, writer Jeffrey Reddick recalled reading a magazine article about a woman who avoided a plane crash after a premonition told her not to fly‚Äîand how it sparked the idea about Death not taking kindly to being ‚Äúcheated.‚Äù He thought of the perfect vehicle for such a story: The X-Files, which was then in its original run. ‚ÄúI wrote that idea as an X-Files [spec script] ‚Ä¶ so it was very serendipitous that we ended up having the film go to [The X-Files executive producers] James Wong and Glen Morgan, who were two of my favorite writers of all time,‚Äù Reddick said.

‚ÄúThe original story was very A Nightmare on Elm Street-influenced, where Death played with their survivor‚Äôs guilt or some secrets that they had to drive them to suicide, which was pretty dark,‚Äù Reddick added. His original script focused on adult characters, but when it was reworked for the movie, they were changed into high-school students‚Äîa studio request in the era of Scream‚Äòs success.

Wong, who directed Final Destination and shares a screenplay credit with Reddick and Morgan, revealed a little bit about what Final Destination might have looked like in an X-Files context: ‚ÄúYou would be concentrating on Mulder and Scully and how they react to [a series of deaths]‚Äîand they had to survive.‚Äù

However, Wong said, the story really was better-suited to a feature film. ‚ÄúAs a movie, the main thing is that you had the time and the budget to make something spectacular that really drew the audience in and give them the surprises you want. In a TV show that‚Äôs almost impossible.‚Äù

NASA‚Äôs SpaceX Crew-9 mission will depart from the ISS on Tuesday around 1:05 a.m. ET. The crew includes NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, who journeyed to the ISS on board Boeing‚Äôs Starliner CST-100 spacecraft on June 5, 2024. The troubled spacecraft was deemed unfit to return the pair to Earth, forcing Williams and Wilmore to travel back to Earth on board a SpaceX Dragon crew spacecraft months after their original return date.

Live coverage of the Dragon hatch closing will begin on Monday at 10:45 p.m. ET on NASA‚Äôs website and NASA+. A live stream of Dragon‚Äôs undocking procedure will begin on Tuesday at 12:45 a.m. ET, and splashdown of the crew vehicle is expected around 5:57 p.m. ET. NASA will resume live coverage of Dragon‚Äôs return at 4:45 p.m. ET, and a press conference will be held at 7:30 p.m. ET.

The Starliner saga has garnered a lot of attention over the past few months, with questions over whether or not the crew had been abandoned in space. Williams and Wilmore were assigned as the first crew to fly on board Boeing‚Äôs Starliner spacecraft. Things did not go smoothly for the crewed test flight, five of the spacecraft‚Äôs thrusters failed on its way to the ISS, and Starliner returned home empty.

NASA had to come up with an elaborate plan to fly the crew back to Earth. On September 28, 2024, NASA launched its Crew-9 mission with two astronauts instead of four (the two being NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov), docking at the ISS on the following day. The two empty seats were reserved for Williams and Wilmore, who were set to return alongside the Crew-9 astronauts in February.

The plan did face some trouble, though, as technical issues delayed the launch of NASA‚Äôs SpaceX Crew-10 mission, postponing the crew handover. That meant that Crew-9, alongside Williams and Wilmore, would not be able to depart the ISS until Crew-10 is on the space station sometime in April. NASA ended up switching the SpaceX crew spacecraft, launching its Crew-10 mission on March 12 to bring the two Starliner astronauts back around two weeks earlier.

The decision may have been prompted by President Donald Trump‚Äôs ploy to use the plight of the two astronauts in his favor. Shortly after taking office, Trump claimed that he is working on a rescue mission for the two astronauts. Trump announced that he had asked SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk to ‚Äúgo get the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration,‚Äù he wrote on Truth Social.

The astronauts, however, were not abandoned in space, nor were they ever in need of a rescue mission. Organizing crew schedules in space can get complicated, and expensive, which is why the Starliner crew had to wait a little longer before they could hop onto a spacecraft headed toward Earth. All that said, we‚Äôll be glad to see the two astronauts back home after an unexpectedly long time in space.",gizmodo

New Drug Shows Up to 100% Survival in Monkeys,https://gizmodo.com/a-pill-for-ebola-new-drug-showed-100-survival-in-monkeys-2000576802,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:35:55 GMT","We may have just found an easy-to-swallow cure for one of the deadliest diseases out there. In research released this month, scientists report that a single dose of an experimental pill dramatically reduced the high fatality rate of Ebola infection, at least in nonhuman primates.

Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch led the study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances. The treatment, an oral antiviral called obeldesivir, prevented up to 100% of deaths in monkeys given a high dose of the deadliest species of Ebola. These findings and others suggest that obeldesivir can become a highly effective measure against Ebola and similar infections that can quickly lead to massive bleeding and death, the researchers say.

Ebola is caused by several related strains of viruses (formally called orthoebolaviruses). The most commonly seen and deadliest version of Ebola is caused by the Zaire ebolavirus (named after where it was first discovered), which can have a fatality rate as high as 90% if untreated.

Symptoms of Ebola initially include fever, aches, and other flu-like symptoms, but the infection can rapidly progress and cause widespread organ damage and heavy internal bleeding that seeps out of people‚Äôs bodies, which is known as hemorrhagic fever.

Ebola is a zoonotic disease, meaning outbreaks typically begin when a person is exposed to infected animals (African fruit bats are thought to be a primary reservoir). But it can also spread between people through close contact with bodily fluids, including blood and semen. While the rapid progression of symptoms and high lethality of Ebola often prevent the infection from spreading widely, it has occasionally sparked large-scale outbreaks. During 2014 to 2016, for instance, a Zaire ebolavirus outbreak in West Africa infected almost 30,000 people and killed more than 11,000. No outbreaks since have reached that level of destruction, but Ebola and related hemorrhagic viruses continue to be a grave public health threat in the countries where they‚Äôre natively found.

Nowadays, there are effective approved vaccines and treatments for some species of Ebola. But the vaccine supply is limited and the current antibody-based treatments have to be stored in cold conditions and taken intravenously, limiting their availability and usefulness. So the UTMB researchers believe that obeldesivir‚Äîan oral version of the antiviral remdesivir, originally developed to treat covid-19‚Äîcan represent a pivotal step forward in Ebola treatment.

In their new study, they gave cynomolgus and rhesus macaques a lethal dose of a variant of Zaire ebolavirus, then gave them obeldesivir a day after infection. Incredibly, 100% of rhesus macaques given obeldesivir survived their infection, while 80% of cynomolgus macaques did as well. The treatment delayed the virus‚Äô ability to replicate and even seemed to promote the monkeys‚Äô adaptive, or antibody-based, immune response to it.

The team‚Äôs earlier work with monkeys has already found that obeldesivir might be effective against Sudan virus, the second most commonly encountered species of Ebola. Earlier this January, the researchers also found that obeldesivir could protect monkeys from Marburg, another deadly cousin of Ebola (a recently ended outbreak of Marburg killed at least 10 people in Tanzania this year).

More research will be needed to validate the drug‚Äôs potential against Ebola in humans, of course. But the researchers are hopeful that obeldesivir can become a broadly applied and more convenient weapon against these deadly infections.

‚ÄúFor outbreak response, oral antivirals might present substantial advantages over now approved intravenous drugs, such as easy supply, storage, distribution, and administration,‚Äù they wrote in their paper.",gizmodo

According to Einstein‚Äôs Theory of General Relativity, you would be crushed by the powerful gravity of its singularity: the center of a black hole where all matter‚Äîand time‚Äîis compressed into an infinitely dense point where space and time break down. New research suggests that, instead of leading to cosmic oblivion, black hole singularities mark a beginning rather than an end.

In a study published March 11 in the scientific journal Physical Review Letters, two researchers applied quantum mechanics to a theoretical model of a black hole. Their results suggest a possible transition, or bridge, from a black hole singularity to a white hole‚Äîa point that, instead of sucking everything into nothingness, spews time, matter, and energy back into the universe.

‚ÄúIt has long been a question as to whether quantum mechanics can change our understanding of black holes and give us insights into their true nature,‚Äù Steffen Gielen, study co-author and a researcher from the University of Sheffield‚Äôs School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, said in a university release. ‚ÄúIn quantum mechanics, time as we understand it cannot end as systems perpetually change and evolve.‚Äù

Gielen and his colleague Luc√≠a Men√©ndez-Pidal, a mathematician from Complutense University of Madrid, investigated quantum mechanics within the context of a planar black hole‚Äîa simplified, two-dimensional model often used to test theoretical ideas. While physically observed black holes are spherical, the researchers suggest that their results can also apply to real-world black holes.

Rather than a black hole singularity, their approach indicates the existence of ‚Äústrong quantum fluctuations,‚Äù which the release describes as ‚Äútiny, temporary changes in the energy of space.‚Äù Instead of space and time collapsing into nothingness, they are replaced by strong quantum fluctuations that may lead to a ‚Äútransition‚Äù into a white hole. In a white hole, matter and time don‚Äôt end. As the theoretical opposite of a black hole, it could be where time starts.

‚ÄúHypothetically you could have an observer‚Äîa hypothetical entity‚Äîgo through the black hole, through what we think of as a singularity and emerge on the other side of the white hole. It‚Äôs a highly abstract notion of an observer but it could happen, in theory,‚Äù Gielen explained.

The researchers also suggest an intriguing connection between time and dark energy, the theoretical force believed to be behind the universe‚Äôs accelerated expansion.

‚ÄúWhile time is, in general, thought to be relative to the observer, in our research time is derived from the mysterious dark energy which permeates the entire universe,‚Äù said Gielen. ‚ÄúWe propose that time is measured by the dark energy that is everywhere in the Universe,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThis is the pivotal new idea that allows us to grasp the phenomena occurring within a black hole.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs return to the original question: what would happen if you fell into a black hole? Either you‚Äôre crushed into nothingness, or‚Äîaccording to Gielen and Luc√≠a Men√©ndez-Pidal‚Äîyou might pull a Matthew McConaughey and pop out on the other side, Interstellar-style.",gizmodo

https://gizmodo.com,Mortal Kombat 2 Is Going to Be All About the Tournament,https://gizmodo.com/mortal-kombat-2-movie-tournament-johnny-cage-2000576881,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:20:55 GMT","The 2021 Mortal Kombat remake was basically a prequel. It followed the evil head of the Outworld, Shang Tsung, who was trying to kill all of Earth‚Äôs fighters so they would be unable to compete in the titular tournament. He, of course, failed‚Äîand now in Mortal Kombat 2, out October 24, the tournament is on. Not only that, it‚Äôs also the driving narrative of the whole movie.

‚ÄúThey keep score throughout the movie,‚Äù Ed Boon, co-creator of Mortal Kombat, told Entertainment Weekly. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a visual representation of who is winning‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not just a tournament for the sake of a tournament. There are huge consequences, so you really are keeping score. And there are a lot of twists in it that keep you on your toes.‚Äù

The wild character list is sure to also keep audiences on their toes. All the big characters from the first film are coming back, as well as a few who died. There‚Äôs Cole Young (Lewis Tan), Scorpion (Hiroyuki Sanada), Sub-Zero (Joe Taslim), Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), Liu Kang (Ludi Lin), Jax (Mehcad Brooks), and Raiden (Tadanobu Asano), as well as Kano (Josh Lawson) and Kung Lao (Max Huang), who were both killed. They‚Äôre back, but we don‚Äôt know how just yet.

They‚Äôll then be joined by Kitana (Adeline Rudolph) and Shao Kahn (Martyn Ford), who appearances were secret until today, as well as Johnny Cage (Karl Urban), who is apparently the key figure for the audience this time around. ‚Äú[Johnny Cage‚Äôs] integration into the Mortal Kombat story and universe is a big part of what this movie explores,‚Äù Boon said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a washed-up Hollywood guy thrown into this magical, ultra-violent thing. Karl, his depiction of Johnny Cage is different than our games in some ways. He‚Äôs adding his own flare to it, but I think it‚Äôll feel fresh. There‚Äôs like a novelty factor in there.‚Äù

We have to imagine several of those are going to be the victims of brutal fatalities though as the field for the tournament keeps getting dwindled down and a champion is crowned. And that‚Äôs key too because if Earth loses the tournament, it‚Äôll be the 10th in a row, which means the Outworld can take over the planet. So yes, the literal fate of the world is at stake in Mortal Kombat 2. Which of Earth‚Äôs fighters will step up and save us all? We‚Äôll find out in a few months.

https://gizmodo.com,Orb Is Netflix‚Äôs Quintessential Thinking Man‚Äôs Anime,https://gizmodo.com/netflix-orb-anime-review-madhouse-2000576670,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:15:03 GMT","Unless something drastically changes in the calendar year, confidently declaring that Earth is a planet in our solar system that orbits the sun wouldn‚Äôt land you in prison. Thanks to generations of egghead astronomers putting their collective noggins together, we all share the collective knowledge about our solar system. While the particulars of how scientists arrived at that truth sound boring on paper, this Netflix show‚Äôs fictional take on the matter is worthy of being an early lock for anime of the year.

Orb: On the Movements of the Earth, animated by Madhouse, is a historical seinen drama set in Europe where the predominant thinking of society and Christianity at large believes in geocentrism. The Earth is at the center of the solar system because we are the main characters of the universe, and other celestial beings, including the sun, orbit around us. Anyone who dares say otherwise is deemed a heretic by the Inquisition, put on probation after extra-judicial torture, and burned at the stake should their zealotry remain unchanged. At the start of Orb, we follow a young man named Rafal, who prides himself on his reasoning and capacity for not rocking the boat. He‚Äôs book-smart enough to ace his college entrance exams and street-smart enough to spout socially acceptable answers his teachers want to hear about geocentrism. That is until a chance encounter with a scholar-turned-heretic pulls him into believing in heliocentrism‚Äîthat planetary thing we all casually believe now‚Äîjumpstarting the anime‚Äôs fatal generation-spanning game of cat and mouse between the church and astronomers about how the universe works.

Orb is an anime that feels like a mix of The Da Vinci Code‚Äòs thrilling mystery, Attack on Titan‚Äòs enthralling political tug of war, and Vinland Saga‚Äòs rich character writing while bringing something all its own to the table. The show expands beyond Rafal‚Äôs contribution to heliocentrism‚Äîsuch as explaining how the Earth can move without us feeling it‚Äîthrough a succession of protagonists who revise, substantiate, destroy, adapt, and distribute the planetary model. These characters include the unlikely duo of a monk and a street fighter, an underappreciated fifteenth-century woman in STEM, a charismatic revolutionary, and a young Romani girl whose collective genius and incurable thirst for knowledge draw them into the orbit of heliocentrism. Despite their motivations for inheriting the theory varying‚Äîwith some seeking capitalistic gain from selling it for profit‚Äîthey all sacrifice life and limb to develop the theory under church persecution and pass it on to the next generation.

Orb could have easily rested on the laurels of saddling its drama as a clear-cut black-and-white affair with an evil church and an altruistic group of astronomers butting heads for twenty-five episodes. Instead, the anime wisely explores why both sides would go to the extremes of putting their lives and the lives of others at risk for their beliefs. The overarching drama in Orb is not a case of Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs depth, where planetary and monotheistic musings equate to a teenage atheist and an out-of-touch bible thumper clashing on social media.

Although Orb‚Äòs narrative framework is somewhat high-concept and heady to parse due to its dense, dialogue-heavy episodes, the anime excels by grounding itself as a compelling character study that celebrates the beauty of collective knowledge persevering through generations of persecution. Except for one protagonist who explicitly states they are an atheist, both sides of the argument strive to demonstrate the perfection of the universe. The Inquisition‚Äôs drive to stomp out heretics is driven by the notion that heliocentrism spits in the face of the Biblicism of Earth being the centerpiece of God‚Äôs perfect universe. To them, the rise of heliocentrism models is tantamount to saying there is something more ideal than the universe being centered on heaven and Earth. Meanwhile, Rafal and most of his fellow protagonists are driven by the desire to prove how perfect God‚Äôs universe is through the complex science and patterns of heliocentrism. The church‚Äôs archaic geocentrism is akin to forcing a puzzle piece into a frame that doesn‚Äôt fit.

The major outlier to the show‚Äôs central conflict is also its most unique element: its central villain, Nowak. Not unlike Christoph Waltz‚Äôs haunting portrayal of Hans Landa in Inglorious Basterds, Kenjiro Tsuda‚Äôs performance as Orb‚Äòs resident boogeyman steals the show with every scene. Unlike the rest of the cast, Nowak doesn‚Äôt have an ideological dog in the race. He is merely an instrument of the Inquisition. In a single scene, Nowak transitions from a lackadaisical, carefree man to a ruthless mercenary willing to inflict extreme torture on men and children alike, to an extent that would make even the most radical inquisitor question their role in the cultural war.

Orb is one of those anime where the action is both sparse and a violent exclamation point to the show‚Äôs intense verbal chess matches, double-crosses, and political subterfuge. The show‚Äôs capacity to conceive well-rounded characters throughout its numerous time skips, place them in the same room, and debate their ideals to perceived allies and enemies alike is more compelling than most fights in this year‚Äôs crop of anime. From start to finish, Orb is an anime that has the potential to stir one‚Äôs soul as effortlessly as the sun pulls the planets into its orbit. More people owe it to themselves to fall into its orbit and give it a watch.

All 25 episodes of Orb: On the Movements of the Earth are streaming on Netflix.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,MAGA‚Äôs Tesla Embrace Means EV Politics Will Never Be the Same Again,https://gizmodo.com/magas-tesla-embrace-means-ev-politics-will-never-be-the-same-again-2000576747,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:35:56 GMT","President Donald Trump, the same man who once said that people promoting electric vehicles should ‚ÄúROT IN HELL,‚Äù bought his own EV this week. He showed off his new Tesla Model S ‚Äî red, like the Make America Great Again hats ‚Äî outside the White House on Tuesday, piling compliments on his senior advisor Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, and declaring the company‚Äôs vehicles ‚Äúbeautiful.‚Äù

It resembled a sales pitch for Musk‚Äôs company, the country‚Äôs biggest seller of EVs. Tesla has lost more than half of its value since December as sales have plummeted worldwide. With Musk dismantling parts of the federal government as the head of the new Department of Government Efficiency, aka DOGE, the vehicles have become a toxic symbol for Democrats, a large portion of Tesla owners. Over the past week, protesters have vandalized Tesla dealerships, set Cybertrucks aflame, and boycotted the brand. Liberal Tesla drivers have slapped stickers on their cars that read ‚ÄúI bought this before Elon went crazy.‚Äù

The strong feelings surrounding Musk have already started to scramble the politics around EVs. Trump‚Äôs exhibition at the White House on Tuesday was a defense of Musk, who he said had been unfairly penalized for ‚Äúfinding all sorts of terrible things that have taken place against our country.‚Äù Yet the bizarre scene of Trump showcasing a vehicle that runs on electricity instead of gas felt almost like a sketch from Saturday Night Live, and not just because the Trump administration has been trying to reverse Biden-era rules that would have sped up the adoption of low-emissions vehicles. Here were the two biggest characters in MAGA politics promoting a technology that‚Äôs been largely rejected by their right-wing base.

Other prominent Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, quickly moved to defend Tesla against vandalism that Trump is labeling ‚Äúdomestic terrorism.‚Äù Tesla‚Äôs sudden shift from Democratic status symbol to Republican icon has some thinking the controversy around Musk could lead to a bipartisan embrace of EVs.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs uniquely positioned to and has the power to really shape this debate and help bridge the divide here,‚Äù said Joe Sacks, executive director of the American EV Jobs Alliance, a nonprofit trying to prevent ‚Äúsilly partisan politics‚Äù from stopping a manufacturing boom for electric vehicles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm unsure if that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs going to use his new perch and his role in the administration to do, but it seems like he has the ability to do that.‚Äù

According to polling the alliance conducted after the November election, Republicans have warmed up to Musk, with 82 percent of those polled saying that Musk is a good ambassador for EVs. A solid majority of Trump voters ‚Äî 64 percent ‚Äî said they viewed Tesla favorably, compared with 41 percent of those who voted for Kamala Harris. ‚ÄúRepublicans are probably inching towards the idea that there shouldn‚Äôt be much of a cultural divide on this product category, if the market leader CEO is sitting next to President Trump in the Oval Office during press conferences,‚Äù Sacks said.

The data aligns with a recent analysis from the financial services firm Stifel, which found that Tesla has become more favorable among Republicans as its popularity plunges with Democrats. Compared to August, 13 percent more Republicans are willing to consider purchasing a Tesla.

Yet there are reasons to suspect that EVs will continue to be a hard sell for Republicans. They are typically tradition-minded people who like big cars, not small cars with new technology they‚Äôve never used before, said Marc Hetherington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and co-author of the book Prius Or Pickup? ‚ÄúConservatives don‚Äôt have the sensibility that fits with electric vehicles at all,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt think that you‚Äôre going to see a spike in Tesla sales among conservatives.‚Äù

Alexander Edwards, president of the research consultancy Strategic Vision, said that Republicans view gas-powered cars as a more practical purchase for transporting their families from place to place. That‚Äôs based on his firm‚Äôs surveys, which examine the psychology behind the car choices of about a quarter-million Americans a year. ‚ÄúI think Elon made a bet that I think he‚Äôs secretly regretting, that Republicans would come out of the woodwork and say, ‚ÄòYes, we‚Äôre going to support you,‚Äô‚Äù Edwards said.

If they came around to any electric vehicle, however, it might be a Tesla. One of the primary things Republicans care about when it comes to buying a car is that it looks fast and goes fast, and Tesla has seen more Republican buyers for that reason, Edwards said. Democrats have consistently been buying electric vehicles at a rate of 4 to 1 compared to Republicans, but 2 to 1 when it comes to Teslas, according to Edwards‚Äô data. Last year, more Republicans than Democrats bought Teslas for the first time ‚Äî not because more Republican flocked to the brand, but because Democrats pulled away from it.

For Democrats, who had long been criticized as having a smug attitude for driving a Prius, Teslas offered a cool and desirable alternative with less baggage when they took off in the early 2010s. ‚ÄúTesla was able to finally give Democratic buyers what they were looking for ‚Äî a Prius-like image of being thoughtful, combined with the fun and excitement of a real luxury sports car,‚Äù Edwards said. That started to change as Musk became a magnet for political controversy, starting with his takeover of Twitter in 2022. A Tesla EV became a symbol of Tesla‚Äôs CEO.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre Republican or Democrat ‚Äî when you jump into the Batmobile, you become Batman,‚Äù Edwards said. ‚ÄúAnd the same thing is true with the vehicles we purchase. We often want them to show who we are, what we‚Äôve accomplished, what we stand for.‚Äù

Of course, there are ways to depolarize electric vehicles that don‚Äôt rely on cues from Trump or Musk. Sacks recommends talking about the attributes of electric vehicles: their ability to accelerate faster and brake more crisply, as well as help people save money for every mile they drive, since there‚Äôs no need to buy gas. When people have friends or family who own an EV, that also helps break down the cultural divide, he said.

In a way, you could see Trump becoming a salesman for electric vehicles as an example of that very phenomenon, with his self-described ‚Äúfirst buddy‚Äù convincing him to come around. Just two years ago, Trump complained that EVs needed a charge every 15 minutes and would kill American jobs. But, after Musk endorsed his presidential campaign last summer and donated $288 million, Trump softened his tone, saying that he was in favor of ‚Äúa very small slice‚Äù of cars being electric. ‚ÄúI have to be, you know,‚Äù Trump said, ‚Äúbecause Elon endorsed me very strongly.‚Äù

On Tuesday, as Trump climbed into his new electric car for the first time, he seemed surprised by what he saw there. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs beautiful,‚Äù he said, admiring the dashboard. ‚ÄúThis is a different panel than I‚Äôve had. Everything‚Äôs computer!‚Äù

Over 8,000 notoriously picky Amazon reviewers have given the ASUS TUF Gaming Monitor an outstanding average rating of 4.6 stars, and most of those probably came from gamers who bought the monitor at its full price of $159.

No Lag, No Hiccups, Just Speed

Everyone knows the first number you check when you‚Äôre shopping for a gaming monitor is the all-important refresh rate. Simply put, that‚Äôs a measure of how quickly a monitor can refresh the image on the screen. If you‚Äôre gaming, that‚Äôs everything ‚Äî a slow refresh rate means a laggy performance when speed is of the essence. The ASUS TUF Gaming Monitor clocks in at a screaming-fast 165Hz, with support for 144Hz. That‚Äôs a pro-level performance that will give you amazingly immersive gameplay.

ASUS‚Äôs Extreme Low Motion Blur allows the monitor to deliver a 1-microsecond response time, and with Adaptive sync to eliminate ghosting and other visual shortfalls. The ASUS TUF also deploys AMD‚Äôs FreeSync Premium technology to create the most fluid gameplay possible, especially for super-fast games like sports or intense third-person shooters like Helldivers II.

Total Focus at All Times

Lesser monitors have so many little annoying pitfalls that you might not even notice until you play on an advanced pro-level monitor like the ASUS TUF. Choppy frame rates, or even something as simple as the dark areas being too dark and the light areas being blown out and overly bright, are hallmarks of an outdated monitor or one that‚Äôs nearing the end of its life.

The ASUS TUF has among its many advanced features Shadow Boost technology to enhance the image details in dark areas ‚Äî like the guy sneaking up on you from the shadows to take you out ‚Äî and brings out the most detail in bright areas without reducing them to just an overlit blur. With support for both Adaptive-Sync with NVDIA GeForce graphics cards (including the GTX 10 and 16 series and RTX 20 series) and FreeSync with AMD Radeon cards, compatibility will not be an issue.

That $70 game will still be around in a couple of weeks. This incredible $99 deal on the ASUS TUF 23.8-inch gaming monitor, however, probably won‚Äôt be. Choose wisely and head to Amazon now before that fat 38% limited-time discount is gone.

https://wired.com,DOGE‚Äôs Cuts at the USDA Could Cause US Grocery Prices to Rise and Invasive Species to Spread,https://wired.com/story/usda-food-supply-chains/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT","Before he was abruptly fired last month, Derek Copeland worked as a trainer at the US Department of Agriculture‚Äôs National Dog Detection Training Center, preparing beagles and Labrador retrievers to sniff out plants and animals that are invasive or vectors for zoonotic diseases, like swine fever. Copeland estimates the NDDTC lost about a fifth of its trainers and a number of other support staff when 6,000 employees were let go at the USDA in February as part of a government-wide purge orchestrated by the Trump administration and Elon Musk‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Before he received his termination notice, he says, Copeland had just spent several months training the only dog stationed in Florida capable of detecting the Giant African land snail, an invasive mollusk that poses a significant threat to Florida agriculture. ‚ÄúWe have dogs for spotted and lantern flies, Asian longhorn beetles,‚Äù he says, referring to two other non-native species. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the American people realize how much crap that people bring into the United States.‚Äù

Dog trainers are just one example of the kind of highly specialized USDA staff that have been removed from their stations in recent weeks. Teams devoted to inspecting plant and food imports have been hit especially hard by the recent cuts, including the Plant Protection and Quarantine program, which has lost hundreds of staffers alone.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs causing problems left and right,‚Äù says one current USDA worker, who like other federal employees in this story asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically a skeleton crew working now,‚Äù says another current USDA staffer, who noted that both they and most of their colleagues held advanced degrees and had many years of training to protect US food and agriculture supply chains from invasive pests. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not something that is easily replaced by artificial intelligence.‚Äù

‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt your average people,‚Äù says Mike Lahar, the regulatory affairs manager at US customs broker behemoth Deringer. ‚ÄúThese were highly trained individuals‚Äîinspectors, entomologists, taxonomists.‚Äù

Lahar and other supply chain experts warn that the losses could cause food to go rotten while waiting in ports and could lead to even higher grocery prices, in addition to increasing the chances of potentially devastating invasive species getting into the country. These dangers are especially acute at a moment when US grocery supply chains are already reeling from other business disruptions such as bird flu and President Trump‚Äôs new tariffs.

‚ÄúIf we're inspecting less food, the first basic thing that happens is some amount of that food we don't inspect is likely to go bad. We're going to end up losing resources,‚Äù says supply chain industry veteran and software CEO Joe Hudicka.

The USDA cuts are being felt especially in coastal states home to major shipping ports. USDA sources who spoke to WIRED estimate that the Port of Los Angeles, one of the busiest in the US, lost around 35 percent of its total Plant Protection and Quarantine staff and 60 percent of its ‚Äúsmuggling and interdiction‚Äù employees, who are tasked with stopping illegal pests and goods from entering the country. The Port of Miami, which handles high volumes of US plant imports, lost about 35 percent of its plant inspectors.",wired

With Alexa+ rolling out to Amazon Echo devices in the coming weeks, we‚Äôre getting a clearer view of the privacy concessions people will have to make to maximize usage of the AI voice assistant and avoid bricking functionality of already-purchased devices.

Ars Technica This story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for technology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by WIRED's parent company, Cond√© Nast.

In an email sent to customers today, Amazon said that Echo users will no longer be able to set their devices to process Alexa requests locally and, therefore, avoid sending voice recordings to Amazon‚Äôs cloud. Amazon apparently sent the email to users with ‚ÄúDo Not Send Voice Recordings‚Äù enabled on their Echo. Starting on March 28, recordings of every command spoken to the Alexa living in Echo speakers and smart displays will automatically be sent to Amazon and processed in the cloud.

Attempting to rationalize the change, Amazon‚Äôs email said: ‚ÄúAs we continue to expand Alexa‚Äôs capabilities with generative AI features that rely on the processing power of Amazon‚Äôs secure cloud, we have decided to no longer support this feature.‚Äù

One of the most marketed features of Alexa+ is its more advanced ability to recognize who is speaking to it, a feature known as Alexa Voice ID. To accommodate this feature, Amazon is eliminating a privacy-focused capability for all Echo users, even those who aren‚Äôt interested in the subscription-based version of Alexa or want to use Alexa+ but not its ability to recognize different voices.

However, there are plenty of reasons people wouldn't want Amazon to receive recordings of what they say to their personal device. For one, the idea of a conglomerate being able to listen to personal requests made in your home is, simply, unnerving.

Further, Amazon has previously mismanaged Alexa voice recordings. In 2023, Amazon agreed to pay $25 million in civil penalties over the revelation that it stored recordings of children‚Äôs interactions with Alexa forever. Adults also didn‚Äôt feel properly informed of Amazon‚Äôs inclination to keep Alexa recordings unless prompted not to until 2019‚Äîfive years after the first Echo came out.

If that's not enough to deter you from sharing voice recordings with Amazon, note that the company allowed employees to listen to Alexa voice recordings. In 2019, Bloomberg reported that Amazon employees listened to as many as 1,000 audio samples during their nine-hour shifts. Amazon says it allows employees to listen to Alexa voice recordings to train its speech recognition and natural language understanding systems.

Other reasons people may be hesitant to trust Amazon with personal voice samples include the previous usage of Alexa voice recordings in criminal trials and Amazon paying a settlement in 2023 in relation to allegations that it allowed ""thousands of employees and contractors to watch video recordings of customers' private spaces"" taken from Ring cameras, per the Federal Trade Commission.

Save Recordings or Lose Functionality

Likely looking to get ahead of these concerns, Amazon said in its email today that by default, it will delete recordings of users‚Äô Alexa requests after processing. However, anyone with their Echo device set to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt save recordings‚Äù will see their already-purchased devices‚Äô Voice ID feature bricked. Voice ID enables Alexa to do things like share user-specified calendar events, reminders, music, and more. Previously, Amazon has said that ""if you choose not to save any voice recordings, Voice ID may not work."" As of March 28, broken Voice ID is a guarantee for people who don't let Amazon store their voice recordings.

Amazon's email says:

Alexa voice requests are always encrypted in transit to Amazon‚Äôs secure cloud, which was designed with layers of security protections to keep customer information safe. Customers can continue to choose from a robust set of controls by visiting the Alexa Privacy dashboard online or navigating to More > Alexa Privacy in the Alexa app.

Amazon is forcing Echo users to make a couple of tough decisions: Grant Amazon access to recordings of everything you say to Alexa or stop using an Echo; let Amazon save voice recordings and have employees listen to them or lose a feature set to become more advanced and central to the next generation of Alexa.

However, Amazon is betting big that Alexa+ can dig the voice assistant out of a financial pit. Amazon has publicly committed to keeping the free version of Alexa around, but Alexa+ is viewed as Amazon's last hope for keeping Alexa alive and making it profitable. Anything Amazon can do to get people to pay for Alexa takes precedence over other Alexa user demands, including, it seems, privacy.

https://wired.com,How Do I Find a Mattress?,https://wired.com/story/how-do-i-find-a-mattress/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:31:00 GMT","Foam: These mattresses are often made of latex or memory foam and have no coils for support. Oftentimes, they begin with a cooling or super-soft contouring foam on top and move to a super-dense bottom foam for support. They contour to the body, providing pressure relief and good motion absorption. They are usually best for side sleepers and combination sleepers without back pain. Although not always, you can find many cheap mattresses primarily made of foam, but these can be heavy, not provide enough support for back sleepers or those with pain, and can be a hot sleep since there isn‚Äôt much airflow with the dense foams.

Spring or coil: Often thought of as an old-school mattress style, this bed has a coil-based support system and is generally on the budget side. Springs often lack pressure relief, and aren‚Äôt recommended for sleepers with pain. Because of the coils, the bed is bouncier than other options and lacks motion isolation.

Latex: All of the layers of this mattress are made with latex rubber, and because of that it‚Äôs bouncy and durable. Like memory foam, latex contours to the body, but because of its density, it isn‚Äôt the coolest option and they tend to be heavier. Natural and/or organic latex beds are generally more eco-conscious. The only all-latex organic mattress I‚Äôve tested is the pricey Essentia Tatami Organic Mattress, which was comfortable and not too hot because of drilled air holes (which isn‚Äôt always the case), but it was super unstructured (floppy and couldn‚Äôt stand on its side without buckling), dense, and heavy (nearly 100 pounds).

Hybrid: We at WIRED tend to think that, in general, hybrid beds are the best for most people. They combine the best elements of different beds‚Äîan innerspring support beneath a top foam for comfort (and often cooling). The top layers are super-comfy foam or latex, with coils (often individually wrapped) underneath for structure. All of my favorite mattresses have been hybrid‚ÄîI find that the combination of top gel memory foams and wrapped coils beneath also help with airflow and have a cooler sleep. Plus, they can vastly vary on firmness to comfortably contour sleepers in most positions, and have a huge range in price (mid-$300s to thousands).

Understand What Type of Sleeper You Are

What type of sleeper you are affects what type of mattress you should buy. This may seem obvious, but it‚Äôs important to take into consideration sleeping type, budget, and what‚Äôs going to fit in your house and be easiest to move. I tend to go for more plush mattresses, but I‚Äôve learned that beds get much softer over time. It's easier to add memory foam toppers to a firmer mattress than to be stuck with a soft mattress that turns saggy and causes lower back pain (been there).

Side sleeper: The stats vary, but most people are side sleepers. Along with stomach sleepers, side sleepers need a little more give to their mattresses, with enough give to let your shoulder and hips sink to give spinal alignment, but not too much so that your spine (and limbs) are unsupported. If the bed is too firm or uses springs only, the less-distributed side weight can become a really painful position on a harder surface, even leading to limbs falling asleep (any side sleeper who has camped knows the feeling). Softer memory foam might seem like a good solution, but it can slowly but surely compress under you and become compacted and flat. Most often a hybrid mattress, using a combination of several layers of foam followed by coils or springs that let pressure points like hips and shoulders sink into the bed, work best. That‚Äôs why figuring out the best mattress for side sleepers is a bit like the Goldilocks parable‚Äînot too firm or too soft, but just right.",wired

Three years on from the concept launch at the Paris Motorshow in 2022, the anticipated hyper-hatchback and the electric reboot of the iconic Renault 5 Turbo and Turbo 2 has now been revealed‚Äîat least partly.

At a brand-hosted event at Renault HQ near Paris, the new hot hatch‚Äôs exterior was unveiled for the first time outside of renders, and, as seems to be increasingly the case with production versions of EV concepts, it looks every bit as bonkers as suggested‚Äîcomplete with the striking yellow and black livery of the 1982 Renault 5 Turbo rally model.

Renault has said this is its most powerful, most advanced car yet, going as far as to label it the world's first electric mini-supercar. With its prominent bumper and rear wing extensions, the design inspiration the compact hot-hatch has taken from its namesake is clear, but it also borrows several elements from the Renault 5 E-Tech electric, including the rear lights and wing mirrors.

Unlike that car, though, the Turbo 5 3E is exclusively rear-wheel drive and is built on a new platform that moves the windscreen back and extends the wheelbase out, giving it the width of a supercar in the length of a city car.

It uses rear in-wheel motors that, Renault says, will bring the Turbo 5 3E in line with the performance of supercars like the Ferrari Roma and McLaren Artura, delivering every bit of torque to the car‚Äôs 20-inch wheels immediately, with no loss and no lag time. The result? This car will not only be fast, it is apparently going to be a drifter‚Äôs dream.

The specs are impressive: 540 hp, a maximum speed of 168 mph, and 0‚Äì60 mph in 3.5 seconds, all helped by a lightweight, carbon fiber body. Renault says the 5 Turbo 3E will be capable of DC fast charging up to 350 kW with an 800-volt architecture, which should take 15 minutes to charge from 15 to 80 percent with the right charger.",wired

A personality obsessed with work

In recent months, Musk had said about X that he would investigate what happened in Germany. A news that probably did not help to dilute the tension: the personality of the South African entrepreneur is obsessed with work and efficiency. As told by the biographer Walter Isaacson, he often happens to vomit and twist for stress; And, competent as in the engineering - his true passion -, Musk personally supervises the projects with pressing questions that terrorize employees. They narrate the rumors of the corridor that more than one is hiding when he passes.

In the sign of the reduction of costs (it is no coincidence that it was pinned of the role of head cutter in the doge of Donald Trump), the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe entrepreneur is to take young people promising to pay less than the established colleagues: a mechanism that can only work in the presence of an excellent intuition on who is worth and who is not. However, despite the rumors about the infernal rhythms and the not really relaxing environment, Musk's companies continue to be attractive: having Tesla or Spacex in the curriculum throats to many, because it allows you to sprout higher wages once - and usually it happens after a few years - that the company is left.

In recent days, Swedish Hedge Fund (speculative funds, Christer Gardell, said what many think: Tesla's actions could be quite outdated. Clearly, the ups and downs are exactly the one on which Hedge Fund Lucrano, and there is a component of interest in this vision. But, even without reaching the drop of 95% theorized by Gardell, it is undeniable that the enthusiasm for Musk's hyper-patinated narrative (which sees in the Tesla of computers with wheels, and not cars) has bewitched the bag for years well beyond the actual results. And among the political positions of the boss, the autonomous guide who shows no progress and the entry of cheaper competitors such as the Chinese Build Your Dreams (Byd), the matter for the Austin brand begins to complicate.",wired
https://wired.com,An online database keeps track of legal actions against the Trump administration,https://www.wired.it/article/tracker-azioni-legali-trump/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:38:01 GMT","Since its first day of settlement as President of the United States, Donald Trump has signed dozens of clearly anti-progressive executive orders. And, as it is easy to imagine, the reactions of unions, organizations for civil rights, state departments and citizens have not delayed to arrive. So much so that Just Security, an online forum for political and legal analysis, managed to put a tracker online that ""keeps trace of the legal actions against the actions of the Trump administration"". On March 15, the date of the last update of the page, 126 procedures are underway - 2 of which closed -, divided into different categories: subsidies, loans and government assistance; Freedom and civil rights; Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility; Removal of information from government sites, and so on.

The most absurd executive orders

The executive orders signed by Trump in the first months of his office certainly could not go unnoticed. Among these, in particular, one of the most criticized is undoubtedly the order ""Defenseing Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government"", in which only the existence of two ""biological sexes"", the male and the female, determined to the ""moment of conception"" is recognized. A measure that, according to the Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union (Aclu), represents a real regress in the protection of the LGBTQ+community.

It is no coincidence that it was precisely the Aclu who intended a federal cause against the American State Department, on behalf of seven complaints, due to a new policy that prohibits the ""x"" gender indicator on the documents of US identity, thus forcing people to have to indicate the sex assigned to them at birth rather than their gender identity. Likewise, the ""Protecting the American People Against Invasion"" order has attracted many criticisms about the Trump administration. The new anti-immigration lines of the government, in fact, have allowed the sector authorities to intensify the efforts to retain and remove immigrants residing in the United States without documents. This led to episodes in which the accelerated warding off of some residents without trial was ordered pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (Ina): an action against which the Association for the rights of immigrants the road New York has lined up, which intended a legal cause against Donald Trump because of the ethicality of the order.

Finally, we could not fail to mention the numerous legal actions taken against the Doge (Department of Government Efficiency) and its boss, Elon Musk. The group of activists Public Citizen and several workers unions have sued the Office of Management and Budget (ORD) for having set up the doge under the president's executive office, claiming that allowing a private individual to access citizens' information is a violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act - a law that regulates the behavior of the Federal Consultative Committees. And this is only one of the dozens of causes that organizations, unions and private individuals have filed to contest the doge access to the personal and financial information of the Americans. In short, the Trump administration does not seem to go well at all. And if it is true that the president will go down in history for signing the greatest number of executive orders in the first months of his government, it is equally true that it could also be remembered for the number of legal actions that target it.",wired
https://wired.com,The third episode of teenascence is the most frightening horror movie that you will see in your life,https://www.wired.it/article/adolescence-netflix-terzo-episodio-spiegazione-finale/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 09:12:33 GMT","When adolescence was announced on Netflix I thought, very superficially (now I realize it) that it was a thriller with the typical boy √† la macaulay culkin in the innocence of the devil. The reassuring diabolical child of the films so exaggerated that he cannot look like any of the teenagers we know, including our children. The fact that it was a British series and that Stephen Graham had been half had to make me rise, is true, but I continued in my blessed ignorance until the moment of the miniseries exit on the platform.

I was unable to see the episodes on the day of the release and the first thing I asked Lorenza Negri, author of the beautiful review, was it but so is it the story of a psychopathic boy? And she replied, no, she is a normal boy. It is probably the best series of the century and is a nightmare.

He was perfectly right and I will focus on the second part of the sentence, that is, that the series is a breathless nightmare, from the first moment he does not discounts at the last moment, he leaves no spiral. Many (including me) have hoped for one of those saving finals that arrange everything and make us go to sleep peacefully. This is not the case, from the first episode we know very well that there is no escape. Jamie (Owen Cooper, of an impressive skill) killed Katie, his schoolmate. We still don't know the reason, but he did it, the rehearsals are overwhelming, they show us, we are there in the police station sitting together with Jamie and his father. In a corner of our mind remains that very small hope that they were wrong, that there is something, anything that can save us from this horror.

Is not there. If in the second episode of the series we can vaguely distract us, the third arrives like a cleaver. The interview between Jamie and the psychologist Briony Ariston (the exceptional Erin Doherty, which you have already seen in The Crown) leaves you breathless. The deconstruction of Jamie, a piece by piece. The painful alternation between the moments in which the boy makes us an immense tenderness and those in which he is very afraid, the banality of evil in the gaze and gestures of a thirteen year old with a beautiful face and a voice that in some moments still brings traces of childhood (and this is truly a stab to the heart for anyone who has had to do with that strange and commented phase in which in the adolescent, the child was, the child who was, the child who was a few years old.

https://wired.com,Discovered a surprisingly large disco galaxy in the primordial universe,https://www.wired.it/article/galassia-a-disco-sorprendentemente-grande-universo-primordiale-scoperta/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:28:19 GMT","The eyes of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have ""sighted"" a stupefacent disco galaxy, dating back to the primordial universe. It is an unexpected discovery, the result of the work of a research group coordinated by Weichen Wang and Sebastiano Cantalupo, respectively a signing of research and full professor at the Physics Department of the University of Milan-Bicocca. Until now, in fact, looking at the primordial universe, the JWST had detected much smaller galactic records than what we are used to observing in the local universe. The just identified galaxy, on the other hand, would be about three times larger than the previously discovered galaxies with star masses and similar cosmic times. The study has just been published in Nature Astronomy.

A look at the past

""When and how galactic records are formed, it is still an enigma in modern astronomy - says Cantalupo - The first years of observations of the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a plethora of galactic records in the primordial universe, which corresponds to a cosmic era of eleven billion years ago, or two billion years after the Big Bang. Before our observation, however only much smaller galactic records were discovered by JWST by JWST than we see in the local universe. For this reason, it was thought so far that the formation of the biggest records had requested most of the age of the universe "".

To investigate this theme, the authors and authors of the study analyzed a set of data collected by the JWST, relating to a region of the sky that is located 11-12 billion years light away from us and which is incorporated into a structure that will probably evolve into a storage of galaxies. It is a very particular region of the universe, characterized by a high concentration of galaxies, gas and black holes.

The newly discovered disc galaxy

""Using the data of two tools - explains Wang - the Near -Infrared Camera and the Near -Infrared Spectrograph aboard the JWST, we identified the galaxies within this hyperdensive region"". After that the researchers analyzed morphology and characteristics, up to identifying a surprisingly large galaxy, which have decided to call ""Big Wheel"" (panoramic wheel), precisely for its enormous size. ""Big Wheel is about three times larger than the previously discovered galaxies with star masses and similar cosmic times, and is also at least three times larger than the current cosmological simulations - continues Wang - It is instead comparable to the size of most of the massive records seen in the current universe"". Further spectroscopic analyzes then confirmed that Big Wheel is a disc that revolves like a spiral galaxy, that is, like the Milky Way, the galaxy that hosts us.

The rapid and early growth of this disco galaxy could have to deal with the particularly dense environment in which it is located, hypothesize the authors, even if further data will be used to confirm this possibility. ""Exceptionally dense environments like the one that hosts the Big Wheel remain a relatively unexplored territory - concludes Cantalupo - further targeted observations are needed to build a statistical champion of giant records in the primordial universe and thus open a new window on the initial stages of galaxies' formation"".",wired

The phantom Apple smartphone with flexible display has been in the center of increasingly insistent rumors for a couple of years, with the concrete possibility that something can move from here to the next two years. The most delicate detail is obviously the final price to the user, given that Apple is certainly not known to be an affordable brand and, usually, the Foldable Phone are among the most expensive models. It is therefore not surprising that the estimates are very salty.

To venture into a preliminary evaluation is the Tim Long analyst in Barclays, who hypothesized a final price for a possible folding iPhone of 2300 dollars. Taking into consideration the American list of Apple, it is almost double compared to the more expensive melafonino or iPhone 16 Pro Max which starts from 1199 dollars. With a parallel using Italian prices you could reach up to about 3000 euros, given that iPhone 16 Pro Max starts from us from 1489 euros.

For a quick comparison, the popular Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 starts from 2099 euros. The price of 2300 dollars for the folding iPhone would also respect another preliminary evaluation, that of the famous Ming-Chi Kuo which had hypothesized a 2000-2500 dollar band, also pushing the base of the technical data sheet with an internal display of 7.8 inches and external to 5.5 "", dual rear camera, Touchid button for the release placed on one side and thickness from just 9-9.5 mm. From closed and 4.5 mm when opened.

All these rumors would imply a construction with booklet opening, while it is not yet clear if Apple can instead focus on a shell model. Usually these simplest hardware mountain models - given the lower dimensions available - and therefore are at more accessible prices. What is certain is that one of the prerogatives of a possible folding iPhone will be the absence of the row near the turn of the display. The possible exit window of this mysterious model is scheduled for 2026-2027, but for now there is nothing official.",wired

Gardens, but also terraces and balconies, they fill again with life and adequately equip them is the best way to make it really exploited in all their potential. Depending on the space and the intended use, of course, different choices can be made, but there are a couple of general rules that can make us as a guidelines. Here then below all our tips to go without fail.

The materials in the foreground

Garden furniture are exposed to the sun, rain, wind and temperature changes between the heat of the day and the cold of the night. In short, not a small stress test, which does not admit the choice of materials not suitable for the purpose, cheap or arranged. For this reason, it is good to rely on brands specialized in the production of garden and outdoor furnishings that guarantee full resistance to weather, reliability and durability.

Eye to the style

Everyone has their own tastes of furniture, you know, but focusing on a sober style and as natural as possible is a good choice that rewards in the long term. Not for nothing, the Rattan and the synthetic materials that imitate him are among the most loved and used ever since they fit without forcing in the external environments and give a beautiful feeling of serenity and comfort that goes well with the relaxation that we seek in our outdoor moments.

Types

In the world of garden furniture, each piece is designed to merge with the natural environment and respond to practical and aesthetic needs. Among the most common types, we find first of all the sessions: from the elegant rattan armchairs intertwined with sofas in resistant and waterproof fabrics, ideal for setting up relaxing corners. Chaise Longue and deck chairs, with their ergonomic design, are perfect for sunbathing in total comfort. The dining tables cannot be missing, ranging from rattan to synthetic materials and aluminum, designed to live convivial evenings under the stars. For those looking for the shadow, the gazebos and the pergolas are transformed into real shelters, creating protected and welcoming spaces, while benches and garden beds add a touch of class and functionality.

How do you explain otherwise the bizarre scene that recently saw the President of the United States, to baste a Tesla teleshopy outside the White House? True, Trump has always been a seller: over the years he has associated his name with practically anything, from casino properties, passing through steaks and, in recent times, also Meme Coin and Nft. At this moment on his online store it is possible to even buy pickleball rackets or branded fragrant candles.

Musk's worrying ascendant

But Trump is above all a seller of himself. Why should he dilapidate all this political capital for Musk, the richest man in the world? Some protests in the Tesla dealerships and the collapse on the stock exchange of the electric car car of his ally do not seem sufficient reasons.

Trump is not an altruist. Musk has paid almost 300 million dollars for the US elections of 2024, most of which in support of Trump's presidential campaign. It transformed X into a sorceress dystopia comparable only to Trump's social networks, Truth. And his work to the so -called Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) has allowed Trump to outsource the boring mechanisms of governance.

Seeing Trump literally reading from a Tesla price list in front of the camera is the most plastic representation of a dynamic that will not end well. And that indeed he has already started to take a worrying turn, for the interested parties and for the Americans: in the United States the stock market is in free fall and the consent for Musk in the polls is touching the fund. The representatives of the Republican Party are deleting public meetings in their colleges so as not to have to deal with the wrath of the voters for the work of the doge.

The criticisms intensified after Zegler herself made several statements to the press in which she criticized the sexist system of the original fairy tale of the Grimm brothers and the animated film of 1937: ""There is a great focus on her love story with a guy that clearly stalking them"", said she, suggesting that the new Snow White would have had a role of greater action and self -determination, song like Someday My Prince Will how (my love a day will come). The remake therefore was criticized for the attempt to make a classic fairy tale ""Woke"".

Also for topics related to the politically correct, the new live-action has also been criticized for the famous figures of the seven dwarfs. The actor Peter Dinklage, he himself a dwarf person, criticized this story in January 2022 he called ""retrograde"", especially for the childhood of Snow White's seven companions. In response to this, Disney had assured that he would do everything ""to avoid reinforcing the stereotypes of the original animated, with a new approach and consulting members of the community"". At one point some images had also circulated on the web, theoretically taken from the set, in which seven very different figures were seen that ""reinterpreted"" the seven dwarfs. In the end, it was confirmed that the seven dwarfs would have been recreated in computer graphics, similar to those of the original film, a move in turn highly criticized because it was considered a missed opportunity to write real dwarf interpreters instead.

Geopolitics and in particular the war between Israel and Palestine also entered the race during the promotional campaign of the film. Gal Gadot, the actress chosen to interpret the bad queen Grimilde, is Israeli and in recent months it has been a very active voice in inviting governments to do more for the liberation of the hostages captured by Hamas on October 7th. For his part, however, Zegler called himself ""pro-Palestina"", reiterating his closeness to the Palestinian people in several posts. After Trump's victory he wrote, always on social media: ""Trump and his supporters never know peace"". Despite the apparently conflicting political ideas, Gadot and Zegler were seen together during the awards of the Oscars, even if on several occasions they promoted the film separate (however not unusual when you want to cover more places of promotion by dividing the cast). In short, Snow White has been talked about so far so far, in the hope that the images on the screen now speak.",wired

https://wired.com,"Alien Enemies Act, what is the law of 1798 invoked by Trump to repatriate alleged members of Venezuelane gang members",https://www.wired.it/article/alien-enemies-act-tren-de-aragua-migranti-trump/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 12:11:21 GMT","Since then, the chronicles tell that the law was used only on three occasions: during the war of 1812 and during the two world conflicts. During the Second World War, in particular, it was invoked to imprison people of Italian, German and Japanese descent. To the Asians (who had hit Pearl Harbor's Base, thus attacking the American power directly) went worse than everyone: it is estimated that there would be about 120 thousand the Japanese imprisoned, in those years, on the basis of the dictation, even among those who were in possession of American citizenship. On the basis, that is, of simple geniology.

Because the Alien Enemies Act has been exhumed

For years of ""invasion"" by illegal immigrants, Donald Trump has been talking about years of ""invasion"", and this is the prerequisite for which the exhumation of a desuetic disposition is based. The president tried to get a minimum shelter from attacks by satisfying the legal requirements in a way.

As seen, the Alien Enemies Act requires that there is public communication, and Trump consequently externalized. In an intervention last Saturday the Tycoon said that the Gang Tren de Aragua is engaged in an ""irregular war"" against the US under the direction of the Venezuelan president Nicol√†s Maduro. The attempt to justify the use of the ultrabicentenary law extending the concept of war to fray it is evident. A republican practice, which recalls the era of George W. Bush with his ""war on terror"" assumption of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - the second, falsifying the evidence of the weapons of mass destruction that the Saddam Hussein regime would have possessed -.

The tenant of the White House has also said that Tren de Aragua ""is perpetrating, trying and threatening a predatory incursion in the territory of the United States"". The lexicon, as can be observed, follows the dictation of the standard, in a clear attempt to establish a connection and, therefore, justify its use.

Aspects that did not escape critics, who have underlined, first of all, the fact that the United States are not currently in war, less than less with Venezuela. Secondly, moreover, it is remarked that the Alien Enemies Act refers to war declarations and threats of invasion by foreign governments, and criminal organizations are not: these are non -state actors. The reference to the link with Maduro is the clumsy attempt to respect, at least formally, the forecasts of the text of the law: clumsy because the statement is difficult to demonstrate. And also because the Central American country does not enjoy international caliber such as to put the United States in difficulty in the case - probable - that it is an invention.

Because the judge blocked the repatriations and stories of immigrants

Trump's arguments did not convince the federal judge James Boasberg of the Federal District Court of Washington who temporarily prevented (for 14 days) to the government the use of the rules to repatriate the Venezuelans. A group of lawyers who agreed to lend their pro bono work to be used on behalf of some arrested. Chilling stories. One of the prisoners, indicated with the initials J.G.G., declares that he had been awakened at 2 am on the night of March 6 and induced to sign documents that, would have been told, they had to serve to renent their personal effects before issuing. The documents would have been subjected to him in English, an idiom that Venezuelan does not speak. But instead of being freed, J.G.G. He was brought to the prison of El Valle in Texas. On March 14, the man is awakened again in the night: the guards told him that he would be transferred elsewhere, but nothing was done because the plane was forced to stay on the ground for a breakdown. It could have been his salvation: in Venezuela the police would have already beaten and tortured him in the past. But the most alarming aspect of the story is that the only indication of its belonging to the Gang Tren de Aragua are two tattoos on the leg: a rose and a skull. Only on the basis of this would the police assume his affiliation. The man, however, offers a different explanation: a professional tattoo artist would be a job. And that tattoo, made for aesthetic reasons, for some time he would have liked to remove it.

Planes already in flight

The Court imposed a 14 -day suspension; But, despite the judge's order, the Trump administration would have also proceeded to some repatriations, with the president who showed off the result on his social network. A challenge to judicial power? Karoline Leavitt, spokesperson for the White House on Sunday 16 March: ""The administration - he said - did not refuse to observe the order of the Court. The order, which has no legal bases, was issued after foreign members of the Tren de Aragua had already been removed from the American territory "". A blow to the circle, and one in the barrel. Until the next occasion.",wired
https://wired.com,The increase in sea level is more serious than expected,https://www.wired.it/article/aumento-del-livello-del-mare-2024-dati-nasa-rischi/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:38:03 GMT","""2024 was the hotter more recorded year and the oceans of the Earth are following on the wheel, reaching the highest levels in three decades,"" says Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, head of the physical oceanography programs and the Etegrated Earth System Observatory of NASA.

Thermal expansion is also favored by the absorption of heat by the deep ocean, a growing phenomenon, reports NASA. Marine water stratifies based on its temperature and density, with hot and light bands that normally position themselves above the colder and dense ones. The heat absorbed by the surface layers is therefore slowly transferred in depth. Strong winds and currents such as those present in the southern ocean can however mix these levels, bringing heat from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. To all this are added events such as El Ni√±o, which redistributes large masses of hot water in the central and eastern Pacific, contributing to the vertical transfer of heat to the ocean.

The risks of increasingly high seas

The satellite data of NASA certify that the annual rate of raising the sea level has grown by more than double since 1993, adding 10 cm in total. Several agencies have highlighted the risks of this acceleration, especially for the Pacific islands.

The Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organization Celeste Saul has warned that ""due to the flowing of sea level, the ocean is going from being a friend of all time to a growing threat"". The Secretary General of the United Nations Ant√≥nio Guterres has defined the trend ""a crisis entirely caused by man"", underlining that ""the world must act and respond before it is too late. It is essential to reduce global emissions of 43% by 2030 compared to 2019 and 60% levels by 2035"".

A NASA study published in September provides that the sea level in the Pacific islands will increase by at least 15 cm in the next three decades. Raising is defined as irreversible and ""will occur independently of the fact that greenhouse gas emissions change in the coming years"". Research indicates that the well -being and safety of insular nations are also threatened.

According to the report to New Climate for Peace (""A new climate for peace""), commissioned by the G7, the raising of sea level represents ""a threat to the economic and physical vitality of the low altitude areas, as the earth and coastal resources gradually be lost. This can lead to social disorders, displaces and migrations, as well as disagreement on maritime boundaries and ocean resources"".

https://wired.com,How the Titanium heart works with which a man lived for over 100 days,https://www.wired.it/article/cuore-di-titanio-sperimentazione-come-funziona/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:04:24 GMT","He returned home with a titanium heart, waiting for an organ transplant. It is an Australian man, about 40 years old and with a severe heart failure, which has become the first person in the world to be able to leave the hospital with a similar device and to live with it for over 100 days. To date, in fact, no other patient had succeeded and this, therefore, could open the way to a potential swab solution for people with heart failure waiting for a heart donor. But how exactly does Titanium's heart work?

The heart of titanium

The heart of Titanium, called Bivacor Total Artificial Heart (TAH), was invented by the biomedical engineer Daniel Timms, founder of the Australian-Stantenese company who takes its name from this device, which we remember to be still in the experimentation phase. Built in titanium, it works like a continuous pump in which a rotor, kept in position by magnets, pushes blood to regular impulses throughout the body. A cable channeled under the skin connects the device to a portable external controller that works with batteries during the day and can be connected to the electricity grid at night. Unlike other devices, which have many parts that often spoil themselves, Bivacor has no valves or mechanical bearings has only a mobile part, and therefore, it could be less subject to problems of mechanical wear.

The record

As the doctors of St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Australia, where the operations were performed, the patient lived with the heart of Titanium for more than three months (from November 2024) until he was subjected to surgery to receive a donated human heart has been performed. It is, in essence of the sixth person in the world to receive the device, but the first to live with us for more than a month. The patient, experts know, is taking back well and this last goal could help research better understand how people can live with this device in the real world and if, in the future, it can be used as a temporary measure. ""This revolutionary procedure, performed at the end of last year, marks a new era in heart transplant and offers new hopes for patients with heart failure,"" commented the experts. According to some cardiologists, as reported by Nature, the heart of titanium could even become a permanent option for people not suitable for transplants due to age or other health conditions.

Experiments

The last Australian patient is part of the US experimentation, led by Joseph Rogers, a cardiologist specialized in cardiac failure and president of the Texas Heart Institute of Houston, in which five patients between forty and sixty years received a previous version of the bivacor last year. In these cases, the device supported patients up to a month in the hospital, but it was not however designed to allow them to return home. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has now approved the extension of the experimentation to 15 other patients, even if a lot of work will still be needed before this Titanium heart becomes the type of treatment that the general public could have access.",wired

On the occasion of the announcement, the company specified the characteristics of the new models arriving on the market, designed to compete in the best way with Deepseek, the Chinese startup that in recent months has fueled the race of the sector companies to the development of models to the advanced.

Let's try to understand in detail why.

Compact supercar

Our first contact took place in Flins-Sur-Seine, a north-west location in Paris where Renault's Originals Meuseum is located, a hangar with all the models of the French house, from the Type A 1898 to the last car produced. A historical archive, for Renault designers and brand enthusiasts (only by invitation). All these cars have been the public at the launch of the new electron fireball. The Renault R5 Turbo 3E has the size of a compact car considered its 408 cm in length. But to make it supercar, already starting from the imprint on earth, is its width of 203 cm. The wording is confirmed is the engine.

PowerTrain is made up of two electric engines installed right in the 20 ""thumb wheels and capable of developing 540 horsepower and 4800 Nm. An important power that pushes the R5 Turbo 3E up to touch the 270 km/h of speed and to cover the detachment 0-100 km/h in less than 3.5 seconds. For overtaking, the steering wheel is equipped with a boost button to increase the power. To adjust the regenerative braking on four levels.

Performance that are obtained thanks to the weight reduced to 1450 kg: the merit goes to the aluminum plate and the carbon fiber bodywork. To feed rear -wheel drive, like that of the past, it is a 70 kWh battery pack which thanks to 800 volt architecture, manages to absorb up to 350 kW of power for a recharging from 15 to 80% less than 15 minutes. WLTP autonomy declares is greater than 400 km.

An electric with the turbo?

Yes, the R5 Turbo 3E is a 100% electric car and so it will be forever because the platform on which it was built does not allow other forms of nutrition. So why the term turbo 3e? If it is true that the mechanical function of the turbo is to improve the performance of the thermal engines without significantly increasing the displacement, this electric sports derived from the Renault 5 E-Tech, recently presented, has all the hardware and software elements to represent the technological equivalent of the first two specimens.

Google announced the change on March 14th, US time, and said it will also be switching to Gemini tablets, headphones, and smartwatches equipped with Google Assistant.

Currently, many Android smartphones offer the option of Gemini and Google Assistant, which has been installed since 2016. After the migration, Google's senior director of Gemini apps will no longer be able to download Google Assistant from the app store.

""We will upgrade our mobile device Google Assistant to Gemini over the next few months. By the end of the year, traditional Google Assistant will no longer be available on most mobile devices, and new downloads will no longer be possible from the mobile app store,"" he explained.

According to the announcement, devices that do not meet the requirements for using the Gemini mobile app, specifically devices that have Androids that are older than Android 9, or devices with less than 2GB of memory, will not be eligible for this transition.

Google said it will also bring ""new experiences"" with Gemini to smart home devices such as smart speakers, displays and televisions. Details will be announced in the coming months, and up until then, Google Assistant will continue to be available on these devices.

This transition isn't surprising, and Google has put Gemini at the heart of many of the company's announcements. This can be seen from the multiple new demos that were shown at Mobile World Congress in early March, as well as the focused treatment at Google I/O in 2024.

Google Assistant has been a central figure for many of the company's devices for nearly a decade.

Do Van Khac, president and CEO of FPT Japan Holdings, revealed in late February that Japan's sales grew at an average annual rate of over 30%, reaching approximately 72.8 billion yen in 2024. The company plans to grow 31% in fiscal 2025, aiming to join the top 20 sales companies in Japan.



Do Van Khac, CEO of FPT Japan Holdings Do Van Khac, CEO of FPT Japan Holdings

There are several policies that are growing. The first is geopolitical risk management. To put it simply, from the perspective of economic security, there is a movement to transfer software development outside of China, mainly Japanese financial institutions, due to the withdrawal of offshore development and shrinking the scale. ""We'll help you do it smoothly,"" Khac said.

The second is AI and GPU support. FPT Software has established a strong partnership relationship with NVIDIA in the US and provides cloud services and other services in Vietnam and other countries. As part of this, Japan has installed 127 GPUs, including the NVIDIA H100, which it has procured from a data center in Inzai City, Chiba Prefecture, and will begin providing cloud infrastructure and cloud services. Financial services SBI Holdings will invest in FPT Smart Cloud Japan, a subsidiary responsible for this, to meet the growing demand for AI and data centers.

The third is the automotive business. Khac said he is working on developing a navigation app with Tier 1 automotive companies that handle direct transactions with automakers. In addition, in order to accommodate software-defined vehicles (SDVs) by Japanese car manufacturers, the company will establish bases in Nagoya, Tochigi, Gunma, Shizuoka, and other areas, aiming to achieve sales of 20 billion yen in Japan by fiscal 2025.

The fourth is legacy migration. In March 2025, they launched COBOL PARK with SCSK, and a team of young FPT Software personnel and senior SCSK personnel will work on migrating the ""COBOL"" program that runs on the mainframe. They also use their own migration tools. In 2018, SCSK established a collaborative relationship in the IT services business in the Asia-Pacific region, and former SCSK president Tanihara Toru has served as chairman of the board of directors of the Japanese subsidiary.

The fifth is going to be the ERP business. We will strengthen support for the implementation and customization of SAP's S/4 HANA and Microsoft's Dynamics 365. First, by 2027, we will have approximately 3,000 SAP engineers, 10 times the current number. As the 2027 issue, when maintenance support for ""SAP ERP6.0"" ends, is approaching, we are hoping for a great business opportunity to move to S/4 HANA.

Acquiring and developing human resources is also essential to implementing these measures. The Japanese subsidiary will employ approximately 1,000 people per year, and by the end of fiscal year 2025, the number will be approximately 5,000 people. They work with over 100 recruitment agencies and send Vietnamese engineers to Japan. In fact, FPT University in Vietnam, run by FPT Software's Vietnam headquarters, produces approximately 10,000 graduates a year, with about 25% of whom joining group companies such as FPT Software. Among them, engineers who have acquired Japanese come to Japan and respond in Vietnam. Incidentally, there are currently about 1,300 Japanese people working in the Japanese subsidiary.

Human resource acquisition and training measures include mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and launching joint ventures. Recently, NAC (NAC), which has approximately 120 employees working on contract development, has become a wholly owned subsidiary. They also create engineers from Japanese IT companies that have participated in capital and are also rekilled to acquire new technologies, such as using AI. Konica Minolta also established a copier software development company, and Oki Electric Industries (OKI) also took capital into a software development company run by FPT Software in China. In addition, we will also consider capital participation in infrastructure building companies with 100 to 500 employees and consulting companies that can respond to Japanese language. It is said that more than 20 Japanese partner companies will also be included.

Meanwhile, US sanctions have constrained the deployment of products outside of China, and it has long been discontinued in Japan, where the company's smartphones are particularly affected, but when asked about the Japanese market, Alex Huang of CMO of HUAWEI Consumer Business Group said he intends to focus on it.

In fact, FreeArc, the wireless earphones, which are one of the products announced this time, is the first product to be released globally in Japan. Although they avoided making explicit statements, there is a possibility that HUAWEI smartphones will re-arrival in the not too distant future.

This allows the same LINE account to be used on two main smartphones (iPhone or Android) and the sub Android smartphones.

The functions are limited on sub-device, and you cannot ""Take over your LINE account"", ""Age verification"", ""Back up your talk history"", ""Purchase paid items such as stamps and emojis"", or ""Set up a theme.""

If your sub-device is an iPhone, you will not be able to continue using the same LINE account as your main smartphone. The CNET editorial department is inquiring on LINE Yahoo, ""Will we implement similar functions for iPhones in the future?"" (Additional note) According to LINE Yahoo, there are currently no plans to support iPhones.

Previously, it was possible to have two LINE accounts if the sub-device was an iPad or PC. Additionally, using the LINE Lite app, which was no longer available in 2022, you could have owned two smartphones.

From April onwards, a PIN will be required for payments above a certain amount, so credit card companies are all warnings at once.

This change is based on the Credit Card Security Guidelines published by the Japan Credit Association (JCCA). With the aim of enhancing security, the previously possible identity verification using handwritten signatures will be abolished at the end of March, and a PIN will be required from April onwards. In addition, ""PIN-less"" transactions, such as ""Trades less than 10,000 yen require no PIN code"" will continue in the future.

In other words, you will need a PIN when using a credit card from now on. For users who have forgotten their PIN code, each company will provide instructions on how to request a PIN code.

According to the companies that provide payment terminals, users of overseas credit cards, such as visitors to Japan, who cannot verify their identity using a PIN, can continue to use signatures to verify their identity.

https://cnet.com,"Kono Taro looks at the problem of a ""single-applied system"" where one student can only apply to one public high school - ""Unfavorable to poor families""",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230579/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 12:41:00 GMT","""Most prefectures have a system in place for public high school entrance exams in a single application system, meaning that one student can only apply to one public high school, but there is a major problem from the perspective of fairness.""

The person who raised this issue was former Digital Minister Kono Taro.

""Under a single-person system, students who are worried about their family's financial strength will have no choice if they fail to try a difficult school, but have no choice but to attend a private school, which creates unfair and inefficient situations, such as students who are forced to take a safe place or who do not attend cram schools fail to get enough information about their exams and fail to accurately grasp what level they will pass,"" says Kono.

‚óèWhat is the ""acceptance pending algorithm"" that Mr. Kono recommends introducing, what is the ""acceptance pending algorithm""?

On the other hand, he also pointed out that ""if students simply implementing a combined application system, high schools that have not been selected will be forced to pass the vacancies from the reserved positions, and there will also be vacancy and the vacancies continue to spurt, resulting in inefficient issues,"" he said the following.

""A system called the acceptance hold algorithm (DA) method, which is currently proposed by Kojima Takehito, Noda Toshiya, and Keio University's Nakamuro Makiko, should be introduced in public high school entrance exams.""

With this algorithm, students submit a list of schools they want to attend, starting from their first choice. Next, in the unified examination for each prefecture, students will be assigned from the top to their first choice school in order of score. If the high school capacity is full, students who use that school as their first choice will be assigned to the next school they would like to choose. This process is repeated.

If you achieve the minimum passing score for your desired school, you will be able to enroll as per the rankings on the list, so students will no longer need to lower their desired school as a safety measure. And, regardless of their financial background, it will create an environment where all students can take the exam based on their own wishes.

The algorithm has a proven track record in public high school entrance exams in New York, and is said to be a theoretically excellent method. Kono also said, ""There is almost no cost other than system development, and it can be easily implemented thanks to advances in digitalization.""

‚óè ""Development led by the Digital Agency""

Furthermore, when he was serving as digital minister, Kono explained that he developed a system that allows high school entrance exam documents to be sent digitally, and that the operation will begin with next year's entrance exams.

""So, the next step is to develop (a system for the DA system) with the initiative of the Digital Agency and provide it for use in each prefecture,"" he concluded.

Toyama Prefecture Governor Nitta Hachiro also posted a post from Mr. Kono. ""I also wanted to introduce a multiple application system for prefectural high schools, but I found the algorithms implemented in the United States to be extremely complicated and thought it would be difficult in one prefecture. I would be grateful if the Digital Agency could work on it,"" he sent a positive message.

https://cnet.com,"What are the release date, price, and specs for the ""Pixel 9a""? Summary of past rumors",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230568/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:17:00 GMT","There are rumors that the ""Pixel 9a"" will be released in March. Previous A-Series devices have been released in conjunction with the developer conference ""Google I/O"" held every May, but this time it seems likely that it will be faster.

There have also been many leaks and reports about the appearance and specifications, including a newly designed camera module and improved battery life. Of course, it is expected to have a wealth of new AI features.

From here, we'll summarize the latest rumors and release dates for the Pixel 9a.

What is the release date for the Pixel 9a?

In 2024, Google released its flagship Pixel 9 series in August rather than the usual October. In response to this trend, the lower-priced model, the Pixel 9a, may also be released earlier, and according to Android Headlines, the most likely time will be mid-March.

This is not surprising. This is because Google is turning Google I/O into a session that is mostly AI-focused, and it is barely covering hardware-related topics. In fact, the 2024 Pixel 8a was announced a week before the event.

What is the price of the Pixel 9a?

According to Android Headlines, the Pixel 9a is expected to cost $499 (approximately 74,000 yen) for the 128GB storage version, the same as the Pixel 8a. The 256GB version is reportedly worth $599 (approximately 89,000 yen).

It is often advantageous to keep prices unchanged in a budget-oriented model. Considering that Apple's iPhone 16e is in a less wallet-friendly price range starting at $599, the Pixel 9a may have an advantage if it is lower than this.

What will happen to the Pixel 9a design?

According to leak information, the biggest change seems to be that there is no camera bar, which is a distinctive feature of the Pixel. According to Android Headlines, the Pixel 9a's wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle cameras seem to be almost flat on the back.

The renderings published by Sudhanshu Ambhore on social media X also feature a more minimalist camera design, with two lenses being placed conservatively on the left side of the back.

Google Pixel 9a renders thread (without watermark) pic.twitter.com/WpFU6MTeBe ‚Äî Sudhanshu Ambhore (@Sudhanshu1414) February 17, 2025

The main camera is 48MP (down from 64M on the 8a), and the ultra-wide-angle camera and the front camera may have the same 13MP sensor as the 8a. Since pixel count is not everything, Google will explain that it has strengthened its camera in a different way this time (I personally think a lot of AI-based enhancements will be mentioned).

According to the rendering, there are also new colors. The Pixel 9a is said to be in the lineup of porcelain (white), obsidian (black), peony (pink), and iris (purple).

In the video of a device called the Pixel 9a, the sides and back look more flat. The volume buttons also seem to be modest.

The screen size will expand to 6.3 inches (8a is 6.1 inches), and the main unit may be slightly thinner than the previous model.

Processor, AI functions, battery

If Google follows the trends so far, budget-oriented models should also have the same processor as the flagship. In other words, the Pixel 9a is expected to use the same ""Tensor G4"" chip as the Pixel 9. However, according to Android Authority, the same Exynos Modem 5300 as the Pixel 8 series could be used instead of the Exynos Modem 5400. While this will keep prices down, you may not be able to use the Pixel 9's flagship feature, ""satellite SOS"" (requires a 5400 modem).

On the other hand, if you are equipped with a Tensor G4 chip, there is a high possibility that the same AI functions as the Pixel 9, such as ""Photo Together"" and ""Pixel Studio"" can be used on the 9a. It is now becoming common practice for budget-oriented models to include the latest AI functions, such as the iPhone 16e with Apple Intelligence and the Samsung's Galaxy S24 FE with the Galaxy AI.

According to Android Headlines, the Pixel 9a's battery capacity is 5100mAh. This is an upgrade from the 8a's 4492mAh. If it is true that it will be thinner than the previous model, improving battery life will be even more appreciated.

It is unclear how true these rumors will become, but they may be revealed surprisingly soon.

The S200 Smart Weight Scale is a scale that connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth. Measurement results are automatically recorded in the Xiaomi Home app on your smartphone.

It also features a high-performance sensor that can be measured in 0.05kg increments. It is said to accurately detect daily weight changes and support effective weight measurements.

The app also allows you to check the trend in weight fluctuations by week, month, or year. In addition to displaying indicators such as BMI, weight management advice reduces the health risks of unhealthy dieting and extreme weight loss.

Furthermore, it is equipped with a balance test function, and when you stand on one foot on the scale and balance it, the Xiaomi Home app displays data on muscle coordination, stability, and reaction time.

Although expensive smart scales are often rechargeable, this cheap unit has a simple configuration with three AAA batteries.

Although it does not have the function of a body composition scale, it is a necessary and sufficient product for users who want to know their weight and want to digitally manage their long-term progression.

Inspection using drones at night Inspection using drones at night

The demonstration experiment was conducted on February 14th at Rainbow Bridge, a long bridge on the Metropolitan Expressway. We have verified automatic flights of approximately 2.8km round trip using drones. This was carried out as a ""Demonstration of video visibility confirmation during night flights"" and ""Demonstration of long-distance flights that use multiple drone ports that can automatically take off and land and charge drones, and redirect between ports."" We confirmed the usefulness of inspection methods in the event of a disaster, using footage shot with a drone.

In addition to delivering stable footage in real time while flying autonomously over the highway at night, it also examined items such as broadcasting footage while flying under the elevated trains during the day and night, automatic takeoff, autonomous flight and automatic landing that travel from drone ports to and from different drone ports, flight information and video acquisition of simultaneously flying aircraft in real time, and centralized management.

In the demonstration of reciprocating between drone ports, communication was interrupted in some footage, but communication with the Global Positioning System (GPS) was relatively good and there were no interruptions. The video can be checked in real time, and the results were found to be sufficient to understand the road conditions even at night.",cnet

It will begin offering from the 18th. Prices are individually estimated.

SRE is a method that optimizes system operational costs and speed-up based on visualized numbers while maintaining system reliability. The new solution will support SRE practices in businesses through the introduction of observability.

Specifically, by utilizing observability platforms such as ""New Relic,"" we can visualize the actual operational situation in addition to information related to the system, such as operations from browsers and smartphones, networks, infrastructure, and applications, by visualizing the actual operation, not only analyzing system failures, but also effectively analyze and improve operations.

Hitachi Solutions will select the most suitable tool that suits the company's challenges and budgets, and will step up the automation of system operations in stages. In addition to system performance, it also provides dashboards that allow you to monitor the actual operational situation and its improvement effect, as well as regular reports from the company's engineers. The company is said to be able to assist engineers in implementing the SRE process over a long period of time, helping them to penetrate the company.

According to the company, SRE is widely adopted by US IT companies as a method to maintain system reliability and meet the speed of change required in modern IT. On the other hand, SREs have not yet been fully popular among Japanese companies, and the reasons for this include a shortage of internal engineers, difficulty in in-house production, and resistance to sudden changes in operation.",cnet

Specifically, Hitachi will link the ""Lending DX Promotion Service for Financial Institutions"" provided by Japan with the ""Digital Services Platform for Financial Services (DSP),"" a microservice platform provided by IBM Japan. This will include a process for enquiring customer information and credit, which financial institutions have accessed individual accounting systems in the past in a series of lending operations, as part of the expansion of the functions of the loan DX service.

Hitachi, IBM Japan, and Amazon Web Services Japan (AWS Japan) have begun co-creation studies on DX promotion, aiming to improve value by solving problems for regional financial institutions and revitalize the region since September 2024. This expansion of the functionality of the lending DX service is part of this.



Image of service collaboration (provided by Hitachi) Image of service collaboration (provided by Hitachi)

Loan operations also play an important role in the operations of financial institutions, and there is an urgent need to digitalize contracts and shift to web channels. On the other hand, this process requires cooperation with accounting systems, making it difficult to deal with, and traditional business flows such as terminal operations and paper media remain. In addition, until now, financial institutions have closely linked various channel systems and external solutions to core accounting systems, and when new services are added, it has been an obstacle to timely service provision, as the accounting systems need to be renovated.

With Loan DX Services, we have previously handled a series of operations, such as electronic contracts and transitioning to web channels, by linking with peripheral systems. With this expansion of functions, real-time data inquiry can be made possible by linking loan DX service and DSP to the business flow related to customer information and credit inquiries that exist within the accounting system.

In addition, by linking the loan DX service and DSP on AWS' cloud services, the transaction menu and service provided will be expanded as a common cloud service, allowing each financial institution to choose a service that suits its bank's needs.

In the future, Hitachi and IBM Japan will continue to work on improving the efficiency of loan application procedures, as well as changing the wide range of loan operations through collaboration between loan DX services and DSPs.

The partnership with Walmart is one that rival Affirm had previously owned.

Klarna will provide the loans to Walmart customers through OnePay, a fintech startup in which it owns a majority stake and is also backed by Ribbit Capital. Klarna will take over providing the loans ‚Äúlater this year,‚Äù it said in a statement.

San Francisco-based Affirm‚Äôs stock took a hit on the news, down 8% by early afternoon on Monday, trading at just over $46.

The two companies have been rivals for years, although Affirm is more focused on the United States. It went public in 2021 and recently announced that it has achieved $80 million in GAAP net income. Klarna, after suffering a massive blow to its valuation, has made a comeback of sorts and reported a net profit of $21 million in 2024, a huge swing from a loss in 2023 of -$244 million.

Last September Affirm CEO and co-founder Max Levchin told PaymentsDive that he wanted to differentiate his company from competitors, including Klarna. One way that it is doing that, he told a technology conference last year, is to focus on earning revenue from individual transactions. Klarna and others have pushed bringing in marketing revenue, he asserted. However, a Klarna spokesperson disputed that, telling the publication that ‚Äúthe bulk of Klarna‚Äôs revenue comes from transactions, with a smaller portion drawn from marketing.‚Äù

Levchin went on to say that Affirm does not monetize transactions through advertising or marketing.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not criticizing ‚Äî it‚Äôs not my place to decide those are bad businesses,‚Äù he was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúBut I love ours, and ours is built around the idea that, ultimately, every transaction needs to make sense financially.‚Äù

Klarna‚Äôs reach is more global than Affirm‚Äôs but it has made a big push into the U.S., telling TechCrunch last April that the U.S. and Germany represented its largest markets but that the U.S. was ‚Äúgaining all the time and is often largest on a quarterly basis.‚Äù

Landing Walmart as a partner will no doubt only increase Klarna‚Äôs presence in the U.S. The retailer is the world‚Äôs largest by revenue ‚Äî reporting $441.8 billion in the U.S. alone last year.

Most of the charges revolve around the Telegram founder allegedly being complicit in facilitating organized fraud, illegal transitions, and the sharing of CSAM (child sexual abuse material) on the messaging and social platform.

At the time, Durov agreed to pay a ‚Ç¨5 million bail ($5.5 million at current exchange rates) and to check in at a police station twice a week. He was also barred from leaving France during the investigation. But those conditions appear to have been modified now ‚Äî enabling him to leave the country legally.

The Paris court did not release a statement regarding the reasons for changes to Durov‚Äôs supervision conditions.

A few days after his arrest, Telegram updated its website and app to explicitly allow users to report private chats to its moderators. Before the arrest, the company had said that it ‚Äú[did] not process any requests related to [moderating chats and group chats].‚Äù

Following this radical change of course, Telegram removed millions of groups and channels.

In further remarks on Durov‚Äôs channel announcing his arrival in Dubai, the Telegram CEO wrote: ‚ÄúI want to thank the investigative judges for letting this happen, as well as my lawyers and team for their relentless efforts in demonstrating that, when it comes to moderation, cooperation, and fighting crime, for years Telegram not only met but exceeded its legal obligations.‚Äù

Durov isn‚Äôt out of the woods just yet. Despite his cooperation, the investigation remains ongoing and it could still lead to a criminal trial in France. On the plus side, at least Durov won‚Äôt have to file his 2025 taxes in France.",techcrunch

Texas software developer Davis Lu faces up to 10 years in prison after a federal jury convicted him of ‚Äúcausing intentional damage‚Äù to his former employer‚Äôs network.

According to the Justice Department, Lu, 55, began sabotaging his employer‚Äôs systems after a 2018 corporate restructuring left Lu with reduced responsibilities and system access.

Lu is accused of creating and implementing a ‚Äúkill switch‚Äù that would lock out all of the company‚Äôs employees from the network if Lu‚Äôs credentials were ever deactivated. Prosecutors say Lu named the kill switch code ‚ÄúIsDLEnabledinAD,‚Äù referring to whether Lu‚Äôs account is enabled in the company‚Äôs Active Directory.

When Lu left the company on September 9, 2019, the kill switch activated, causing widespread system disruptions affecting thousands of employees globally. The Justice Department said Lu caused the company ‚Äúhundreds of thousands of dollars in losses.‚Äù

https://techcrunch.com,OpenAI to start testing ChatGPT connectors for Google Drive and Slack,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/openai-to-start-testing-chatgpt-connectors-for-google-drive-and-slack/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","OpenAI will soon begin testing a way for business customers to connect apps like Slack and Google Drive to ChatGPT.

OpenAI plans to start beta testing a new feature called ChatGPT Connectors, according to a document viewed by TechCrunch. ChatGPT Connectors will allow ChatGPT Team subscribers to link workspace Google Drive and Slack accounts to ChatGPT so the chatbot can answer questions informed by files, presentations, spreadsheets, and Slack conversations across those accounts.

OpenAI plans to expand ChatGPT Connectors to other platforms, like Microsoft SharePoint and Box, in the future, according to the document.

‚ÄúThis will allow employees using ChatGPT to easily make use of internal information similar to how they can use world knowledge via web search,‚Äù reads the document.

ChatGPT Connectors is OpenAI‚Äôs latest attempt to make ChatGPT an indispensable part of businesses‚Äô software toolkits. While some companies have expressed reservations about allowing ChatGPT to access sensitive business info, others have embraced the tech with open arms.

ChatGPT Connectors could convince wary company executives to change their position ‚Äî and present a formidable challenge to AI-powered enterprise search platforms like Glean.

ChatGPT Connectors, which is launching in beta for select ChatGPT Team users, is powered by a version of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o model that can refine its responses based on ‚Äúinternal [company] knowledge,‚Äù according to the document. All users in a participating ChatGPT Team workspace gain access to the model via OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT apps.

The custom GPT-4o model searches and ‚Äúreads‚Äù internal information possibly relevant to a query. To create a search index, OpenAI syncs an encrypted copy of company files and conversations on ChatGPT‚Äôs servers, per the document.

‚ÄúAdditional related information which [sic] the model did not directly make use of is accessible by clicking on the sources button at the bottom of each response,‚Äù the document reads. ‚ÄúWhen appropriate, the model will directly respond with a list of relevant results.‚Äù

Perhaps to assure customers that ChatGPT won‚Äôt leak their private data, the document highlights that Slack and Google Drive permissions are ‚Äúfully respected‚Äù and ‚Äúkept continuously up to date.‚Äù For example, ChatGPT Connector syncs Slack private channel memberships and Drive file permissions as well as directory information.

Employees won‚Äôt be able to discover content via ChatGPT that they can‚Äôt access in Google Drive or Slack, according to the OpenAI document, and admins will have the ability to choose which Slack channels and Google Drive files are synced. As a slight downside, employees might get ‚Äúsubstantially different‚Äù responses to the same ChatGPT prompts, OpenAI said in the document.

There are technical limits to what ChatGPT Connector can access, as well.

Images in Google Drive files (e.g. Google Docs, Google Slides, PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and plain text) aren‚Äôt supported, according to the document, which noted that ChatGPT Connector can only ‚Äúread‚Äù ‚Äî not analyze ‚Äî data in Sheets and Excel workbooks. ChatGPT Connector can‚Äôt retrieve Slack DMs or group messages, and it‚Äôll ignore messages from Slack bots.

Companies that wish to participate in the ChatGPT Connector beta are being asked to provide OpenAI with 100 documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and/or Slack channel conversations. The company said in the document it won‚Äôt directly train on the information, but may use them ‚Äúas input to synthetic data generation‚Äù that might be used in its training.

‚ÄúNo data synced from Google Drive or Slack will be used for training,‚Äù the document reads.

https://techcrunch.com,Travis Kalanick wants to do a lot more than develop more ghost kitchens,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/travis-kalanick-wants-to-do-a-lot-more-than-develop-more-ghost-kitchens/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Last week, at the Abundance Summit in Los Angeles, billionaire entrepreneur Travis Kalanick gave attendees a rare glimpse into his vision for the future of his newest company, CloudKitchens. While today the eight-year-old L.A.-based outfit is known for a growing real estate portfolio that it uses to it host ‚Äì and set up ‚Äì restaurants that use its kitchens to fulfill food deliveries, Kalanick hinted at a full-stack future. In fact, he appears to be aiming to eventually deliver AI-perfected meals directly to customers.

Kalanick brought up the topic twice, in different contexts. First, during his informal sit-down with conference organizer Peter Diamandis, he drew parallels between CloudKitchens and earlier disruptions in other industries. He noted that taxi apps existed before Uber, but said their mistake was trying to take a ‚Äúslice‚Äù of the existing market. That market, he explained, was both small and unreliable, as taxis could easily bypass the apps. Kalanick similarly referenced the gaming company Zynga, which initially built its business on Facebook‚Äôs platform, only to be later undermined by the social media giant.

Turning to CloudKitchens, he pointed out that restaurants relying on Uber Eats or DoorDash face a similar challenge. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting yield optimization on a thing that‚Äôs built for something else,‚Äù he said. If you‚Äôre ‚Äúon somebody else‚Äôs platform,‚Äù he warned, ‚Äúthey can squeeze you.‚Äù

Later, when an audience member asked Kalanick about the future of CloudKitchens and its use of AI, Kalanick again hinted that CloudKitchens isn‚Äôt content to forever provide turn-key restaurant spaces. He talked, for example, about cooking-as-a-service ‚Äî much like driving has become a service instead of something we all do for ourselves ‚Äî and insisted that healthy meals will be made available to all and ‚Äúnot just the wealthy.‚Äù

He also talked at a high level about AI‚Äôs role in transforming the physical world, distinguishing between ‚ÄòAI for bits‚Äô (such as AI chatbots like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok) and what Kalanick called ‚Äòatoms AI‚Äô, meaning AI that interacts with the physical world. Here, he referenced autonomous cars and humanoid robots, noting the ‚Äúball game‚Äù is changing.

Unfortunately, instead of poke further, Diamandis moved onto the next attendee‚Äôs question. And Kalanick hasn‚Äôt yet responded to a request for more information. But if the ultimate idea is to deliver customers AI-optimized breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Kalanick isn‚Äôt the only billionaire trying: famed e-commerce entrepreneur Marc Lore has raised substantial funding for a venture, Wonder, which launched as a spiffed-up ghost kitchen but is steadily expanding its ambitions ‚Äî and actively talking about it.

Last November, when the New York-based outfit acquired the delivery service GrubHub, Lore told TechCrunch that Wonder is aiming to ‚Äúput the pieces together to‚Ä¶ manage what you eat and your health in a way that‚Äôs never been done before.‚Äù

During that same in-person interview, Lore went into great detail, painting a future where AI-driven meal planning seamlessly integrates with a customer‚Äôs dietary preferences, health goals, and wearable device data. Describing an AI system that could tailor meal recommendations based on real-time health data, such as, say, blood test results indicating high mercury levels, he said that Wonder‚Äôs ‚Äúbig vision‚Äù is to be ‚Äúthe super app for mealtime.‚Äù

It sounded at the time like fantasy, the idea of waking up to a personalized, health-focused meal plan designed by AI. Yet both Kalanick and Lore have track records of disrupting industries that didn‚Äôt seem vulnerable to disruption ‚Äî Kalanick with Uber, and Lore with Jets.com. If they are targeting the same future ‚Äì one where AI-driven food services fully replace traditional cooking ‚Äì it adds credibility to the idea that this shift may not be a matter of ‚Äòif‚Äô but ‚Äòwhen.‚Äô

Wonder has so far raised $1.6 billion from investors. CloudKitchens has reportedly raised a similar amount of funding, though it has been tighter-lipped about everything it‚Äôs doing to date.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,Nvidia GTC 2025: What to expect from this year‚Äôs show,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/nvidia-gtc-2025-what-to-expect-from-this-years-show/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","GTC, Nvidia‚Äôs biggest conference of the year, begins Monday and runs till Friday in San Jose, with the biggest announcements probably coming Tuesday. TechCrunch will be on the ground covering the news as it happens ‚Äî and we‚Äôre expecting a healthy dose of announcements. And we‚Äôre making it easy for you to follow along.

CEO Jensen Huang will give a keynote address at the SAP Center on Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT, focusing on ‚Äî what else? ‚Äî AI and accelerating computing technologies, according to Nvidia. The company is also teasing reveals related to robotics, sovereign AI, AI agents, and automotive ‚Äî plus 1,000 sessions with 2,000 speakers and close to 400 exhibitors.

Here‚Äôs how to watch the Nvidia GTC 2025 keynote online, along with many other sessions, talks, and panels.

So what do we expect to see at GTC? Well, Nvidia typically reserves a big chunk of the conference for GPU-related debuts. A new, upgraded iteration of the company‚Äôs Blackwell chip lineup seems likely.

During Nvidia‚Äôs most recent earnings call, Huang confirmed that the upcoming Blackwell B300 series, codenamed Blackwell Ultra, is slated for release in the second half of this year. In addition to higher computing performance, Blackwell Ultra cards pack more memory (288GB), an attractive feature for customers looking to run and train memory-hungry AI models.

Rubin, Nvidia‚Äôs next-gen GPU series, is almost certain to get a mention at GTC alongside Blackwell Ultra. Due out in 2026, Rubin promises to deliver what Huang has described as a ‚Äúbig, big, huge step up‚Äù in computing power.

Huang said during the aforementioned Nvidia earnings call that he‚Äôd talk about post-Rubin products at GTC, as well. That could be Rubin Ultra GPUs, or perhaps the GPU architecture that‚Äôll come after the Rubin family. (The chips are named after Vera Rubin, the astronomer who discovered dark matter.)

Beyond GPUs, Nvidia may illuminate its approach to recent quantum computing advancements. The company has scheduled a ‚Äúquantum day‚Äù for GTC, during which it‚Äôll host execs from prominent companies in the space to ‚Äú[map] the path toward useful quantum applications.‚Äù

One thing‚Äôs for sure: Nvidia could use a win.

Early Blackwell cards reportedly suffered from severe overheating issues, causing customers to cut their orders. U.S. export controls and fears of tariffs have massively depressed Nvidia‚Äôs stock price in recent months. At the same time, the success of Chinese AI lab DeepSeek, which developed efficient models competitive with models from leading AI labs, has prompted investors to worry about the demand for powerful GPUs like Blackwell.

Huang has asserted that DeepSeek‚Äôs rise to prominence will in fact be a net positive for Nvidia because it‚Äôll accelerate the broader adoption of AI technology. He has also pointed to the growth of power-hungry so-called ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù models like OpenAI‚Äôs o1 as Nvidia‚Äôs next mountain to climb.

To be clear, Nvidia isn‚Äôt exactly hurting. The company reported a record-breaking quarter in February, notching $39.3 billion in revenue and projecting $43 billion in revenue for the subsequent quarter. While rivals such as AMD have begun to encroach on the company‚Äôs territory, Nvidia still commands an estimated 82% of the GPU market. But Huang is reportedly feeling impatient to see AI applications that matter beyond the tech industry.

Marko Elez, a DOGE staffer working at the U.S. Treasury, emailed a spreadsheet with unencrypted personally identifiable information to two Trump administration officials prior to his resignation in early February after racist social media posts linked to Elez surfaced online.

Details of the security lapse emerged in a court filing on Friday containing testimony by David Ambrose, the chief security and privacy officer at the Treasury‚Äôs Bureau of Fiscal Services, the division of the Treasury that disburses some trillions of dollars in federal funds to American households every year. A coalition of U.S. attorneys general brought the lawsuit in an effort to block the Trump administration‚Äôs team of DOGE cost-cutters from accessing highly sensitive personal and financial data on millions of Americans held by the Treasury unit where Elez was posted.

Per the court filing on Friday, Ambrose said the Treasury conducted a forensic analysis of Elez‚Äôs department-issued laptop following his resignation, which included a review of his Treasury email account revealing the security lapse.

The filing did not say exactly what data was shared, but described the personal information as including a name (such as a person or entity), the type of transaction, and an amount of money.

Ambrose said Elez acted ‚Äúcontrary to [the department‚Äôs] policies‚Äù because the data was not encrypted nor was the email approved before it was sent.

Bloomberg was the first to report the court filing on Friday.

Elez was rehired on February 18. He now works at the Social Security Administration, a person familiar with personnel matters told TechCrunch.

In response to the filing, the coalition of U.S. attorneys general that brought the suit said on Friday that Ambrose‚Äôs declarations ‚Äúdo nothing to allay any of the concerns‚Äù that the states brought ‚Äúabout the rushed and chaotic nature of the Treasury DOGE Team onboarding process.‚Äù

Apple, for example, once sued a former chip design executive who founded his own chip startup in a case that was dropped in 2023.

A recent case involving logistics unicorn Flexport and a new competitor formed by two former employees sheds light on those risks.

Flexport is suing the pair alleging that they stole thousands of its documents along with its source code to create their own rival startup, Freightmate AI.

Both startups use technology to automate complex logistics and shipping processes.

Flexport says it believes Freightmate‚Äôs COO Yingwei Zhao downloaded over 70,000 confidential Flexport documents after he agreed to form Freightmate with now-CEO Bryan Lacaillade, Flexport said in the lawsuit, which was filed last week in a California court.

Flexport claims that Zhao took steps to hide his tracks like using Incognito Mode on his browser to copy-paste a list of over 1,000 Flexport customers. The suit alleges that Zhao also downloaded Flexport‚Äôs source code from Github onto his USB drive.

Freightmate admitted to being in possession of some files from Flexport but said the files were ‚Äúinadvertently retained‚Äù and not accessed or used by Freightmate, according to the suit.

Flexport declined to comment. Freightmate didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.

Flexport claims recent growth touted by Freightmate would have been ‚Äúvirtually impossible‚Äù without information it insists was stolen. It is suing for unspecified damages and an injunction from the court, which could be used to stop Freightmate from using the allegedly stolen data.

Flexport is based in San Francisco and was valued at $8 billion in a 2022 funding round. It most recently raised a $260 million round provided by Shopify at an undisclosed valuation in 2023.

Freightmate is based near Seattle and raised a $5 million seed round in January 2025 led by Washington state VC firm Fuse Capital. Its pre-seed round, whose amount was undisclosed, was led by Winschoff Ventures.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,YC-backed ReactWise is applying AI to speed up drug manufacturing,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/yc-backed-reactwise-is-applying-ai-to-speed-up-drug-manufacturing/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Artificial intelligence continues stirring things up in chemistry. To wit: Y Combinator-backed Cambridge, U.K.-based ReactWise is using AI to speed up chemical manufacturing ‚Äî a key step in bringing new drugs to market.

Once a promising drug has been identified in the lab, pharma firms need to be able to produce much larger amounts of the material to run clinical trials. This is where ReactWise is offering to step in with its ‚ÄúAI copilot for chemical process optimization,‚Äù which it says accelerates by 30x the standard trial-and-error-based process of figuring out the best method for making a drug.

‚ÄúMaking drugs is really like cooking,‚Äù said co-founder and CEO Alexander Pomberger (pictured above left, with co-founder and CTO Daniel Wigh) in a call with TechCrunch. ‚ÄúYou need to find the best recipe to make a drug with a high purity and a high yield.‚Äù

The industry has for years relied upon what boils down to either trial-and-error or staff expertise for this ‚Äúprocess development,‚Äù he said. Adding automation into the mix offers a way to shrink how many iteration cycles are required to land on a solid recipe for manufacturing a drug.

The startup thinks it will be able to deliver ‚Äúone shot prediction‚Äù ‚Äî where the AI will be able to ‚Äúpredict the ideal experiment‚Äù almost immediately, without the need for multiple iterations where data on each experiment is fed back in to further hone predictions ‚Äî in the near future (‚Äúin two years,‚Äù is Pomberger‚Äôs bet).

The startup‚Äôs machine learning AI models can still deliver major savings by reducing how much iteration is required to get past this bit of the drug development chain.

Cutting through the tedium

‚ÄúThe inspiration for this was: I‚Äôm a chemist by training, I worked in Big Pharma, and I saw how tedious and trial-and-error driven the whole industry is,‚Äù he said, adding that the business is essentially consolidating five years of academic research ‚Äî his doctorate focused on ‚Äúthe automation of chemical synthesis driven by robotic workflow and AI‚Äù ‚Äî into what he bills as ‚Äúa simple software.‚Äù

Underpinning ReactWise‚Äôs product are ‚Äúthousands‚Äù of reactions that the startup has performed in its labs in order to capture data-points to feed its AI-driven predictions. Pomberger says the startup used a ‚Äúhigh throughput screening‚Äù method in its lab, which allowed it to screen 300 reactions at a time, enabling it to speed up the process of capturing all this training data for its AI.

‚ÄúIn pharma ‚Ä¶ there are one or two handfuls of reactions, reaction types, that are used over and over again,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat we are doing is we have a laboratory where we generate thousands of data points for these most relevant reactions, train foundational reactivity models on our side, and those models can fundamentally understand chemistry. And then when a client pharmaceutical company needs to develop a scalable process, they don‚Äôt need to start from scratch.‚Äù

The startup commenced this process of capturing reaction types to train its AIs last August, and Pomberger said it will be completed by the summer. It‚Äôs working toward spanning 20,000 chemical data points to ‚Äúcover the most important reactions.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo get one single data point in a traditional manner it takes a chemist, typically, one to three days,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúSo this is really, we call it, expensive to evaluate data. It‚Äôs very hard to get the single data points.‚Äù

So far it‚Äôs focused on manufacturing processes for ‚Äúsmall molecule drugs,‚Äù which Pomberger said can be used in medicines targeting all sorts of diseases. But he suggested that the technology could be applied in other disciplines, too, noting that the company is also working with two material manufacturers in polymer drug delivery development.

ReactWise‚Äôs automation play also includes software that can interface with robotic lab equipment to further dial up precision manufacturing of drugs. Though, to be clear, it‚Äôs purely focused on selling software; it‚Äôs not a maker of robotic lab kit itself. Rather, it‚Äôs adding another string to its bow in being able to offer to drive robotic lab equipment if its customers have such kit to hand.

The U.K. startup, which was founded in July 2024, has 12 pilot trials of its software up and running with pharma companies. Pomberger said they‚Äôre expecting the first conversions ‚Äî into full-scale deployments of the subscription software ‚Äî later this year. And while it isn‚Äôt yet revealing the names of all the firms it‚Äôs working with, ReactWise says these trials include some Big Pharma players.

Pre-seed funding

ReactWise is disclosing full details of its pre-seed raise, which totals $3.4 million, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch.

The figure includes previously disclosed backing from YC ($500,000) and an Innovate U.K. grant of close to ¬£1.2 million (around $1.6 million). The rest of the funding (around $1.5 million) is coming from unnamed venture capitalists and angel investors, who ReactWise says are ‚Äúcommitted to advancing AI-driven, sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing.‚Äù

While ReactWise is focusing, fairly narrowly, on a specific part of the drug development chain, Pomberger said acceleration here can make a meaningful difference in shrinking the time it takes to get new pharmaceuticals to patients.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look at a typical duration of a drug from start to launch: 10 to 12 years. Process development takes one to 1.5 to two years. And if we can basically speed up here the workflows ‚Äî reduce it by an average of 60% ‚Äî then we can get an idea of how much an effect it is,‚Äù he noted.

Simultaneously, other startups are applying AI to different aspects of drug development, including identifying interesting chemicals in the first place, so there‚Äôs likely to be compounding effects as more automation innovations get folded in.

But when it comes to drug manufacturing, specifically, Pomberger argues that ReactWise is ahead of the pack. ‚ÄúWe were the first to actually tackle this,‚Äù he said.

The startup competes with legacy software using statistical approaches, such as JMP. He also said that there are a few others applying AI to speed up drug manufacturing, but said that ReactWise‚Äôs access to high-quality datasets on chemical reactions gives it the competitive edge.

‚ÄúWe are the only ones that have the capability of, and that are currently generating, these high-quality datasets in house,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMost of our competitors, they provide the software. The clients are basically prompted with instructions based on the inputs.

‚ÄúBut, from our side of things, we offer these pretrained models ‚Äî and those are extremely powerful because they fundamentally understand chemistry. And the idea is then to really have a client just say: ‚ÄòThis is my reaction of interest, hit start, and we already give them process recommendations from the very first day, based on all the pre-work that we did in our laboratory. And that‚Äôs something nobody else does at the moment.‚Äù",techcrunch

The constellation will keep a close eye on wildfires. When fully operational, the constellation‚Äôs more than 50 satellites will be able to image nearly all of Earth‚Äôs surface once every 20 minutes. The initial phase will consist of just three satellites, and it will revisit every point on the globe twice per day when it‚Äôs operational in 2026.

The first satellite was built by Muon Space and launched aboard SpaceX‚Äôs Transporter 13 mission on March 14 from Vandenberg Space Force Base. The sensor suite consists of six-band multispectral infrared cameras, which are tuned to detect wildfires from a distance.

Most wildfire tracking today uses aerial photography via airplanes or low-resolution satellite imagery that‚Äôs been repurposed for the task. The former is expensive, limiting how frequently it can be updated, while the latter suffers from low resolution and sensors not specifically tuned to wildfire detection.

The FireSate constellation is designed to solve both of those problems. Its produces five-meter resolution imagery, and when the constellation is flying its full complement, it‚Äôll provide firefighters with near real-time updates on a fire‚Äôs whereabouts and behavior.

https://techcrunch.com,Hackers are exploiting Fortinet firewall bugs to plant ransomware,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/hackers-are-exploiting-fortinet-firewall-bugs-to-plant-ransomware/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Security researchers have observed hackers linked to the notorious LockBit gang exploiting a pair of Fortinet firewall vulnerabilities to deploy ransomware on several company networks.

In a report published last week, security researchers at Forescout Research said a group it‚Äôs tracking dubbed ‚ÄúMora_001‚Äù is exploiting the Fortinet firewalls, which sit on the edge of a company‚Äôs network and act as digital gatekeepers, to break in and deploy a custom ransomware strain they call ‚ÄúSuperBlack.‚Äù

One of the vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2024-55591, has been exploited in cyberattacks to breach the corporate networks of Fortinet customers since December 2024. Forescout says a second bug, tracked as CVE-2025-24472, is also being exploited by Mora_001 in attacks. Fortinet released patches for both bugs in January.

Sai Molige, senior manager of threat hunting at Forescout, told TechCrunch that the cybersecurity firm has ‚Äúinvestigated three events in different companies, but we believe there could be others.‚Äù

In one confirmed intrusion, Forescout said it observed the attacker ‚Äúselectively‚Äù encrypting file servers containing sensitive data.

‚ÄúThe encryption was initiated only after data exfiltration, aligning with recent trends among ransomware operators who prioritize data theft over pure disruption,‚Äù said Molige.

Forescout says the Mora_001 threat actor ‚Äúexhibits a distinct operational signature,‚Äù which the firm says has ‚Äúclose ties‚Äù to the LockBit ransomware gang, which was last year disrupted by U.S. authorities. Molige said the SuperBlack ransomware is based on the leaked builder behind the malware used in LockBit 3.0 attacks, while a ransom note used by Mora_001 includes the same messaging address used by LockBit.

Stefan Hostetler, head of threat intelligence at cybersecurity firm Arctic Wolf, which previously observed exploitation of CVE-2024-55591, tells TechCrunch that Forescout‚Äôs findings suggest hackers are ‚Äúgoing after the remaining organizations who were unable to apply the patch or harden their firewall configurations when the vulnerability was originally disclosed.‚Äù

In addition to ID verification, the company also released three more features, including a feature that flags inappropriate messages in chat before users hit send and the ability to share date details with friends. Bumble also launched a ‚ÄúDiscover‚Äù page dedicated to helping users find matches with similar interests.

Bumble‚Äôs new verification feature lets users submit a picture of a government-issued ID to authenticate their identity and earn a badge for their profile. This allows users to sort profiles according to those who are ID verified and also to ask their matches to complete the verification process.

The feature is currently available in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, France, India, Ireland, Spain, Germany, Mexico, and New Zealand. It plans to expand to additional markets soon.

Bumble‚Äôs ID verification badge comes as AI makes it harder to figure out which dating profiles are real or fake. It also comes as romance scams continue. Rival Tinder expanded its identity verification program last year to the U.S., U.K., Brazil, and Mexico.

Additionally, a new ‚ÄúShare Date‚Äù feature allows Bumble users to share their date details ‚Äî such as the person they‚Äôre meeting, the time, and location ‚Äî with people they trust. If plans change, they can update their friends directly in the app. Tinder launched a ‚ÄúShare My Date‚Äù feature in April 2024.

Another feature focused on safety, ‚ÄúReview Before You Send,‚Äù targets the messaging section, where users frequently encounter inappropriate messages. Initially introduced for the Compliments feature, Review Before You Send reminds senders to edit flagged messages before sending.

Bumble‚Äôs new ‚ÄúDiscover‚Äù experience offers a new way to find the most compatible people. Similar to Tinder‚Äôs ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù page, users can explore different categories to find people with shared dating intentions, similar interests, and communities. The profiles are refreshed daily.

As duties under the U.K.‚Äôs Online Safety Act (OSA) related to tackling illegal content came into force Monday, the internet watchdog, Ofcom, said it has launched a new enforcement program focused on online storage and file-sharing services.

The enforcement programme will assess safety measures they put in place that are aimed at preventing offenders from disseminating CSAM on their services.

Ofcom added that it has written to ‚Äúa number‚Äù of these services, without naming any of those involved. It has put them on notice that ‚Äúformal information requests‚Äù will soon be sent regarding the measures they have already implemented or plan to implement to tackle CSAM.

Snap announced on Monday that it‚Äôs launching the ability to create Spectacles-focused Lenses that tap GPS, new hand-tracking capabilities, and more. Now, developers can build Lenses using GPS, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), compass heading, and custom locations, allowing them to access geo-location data and create things like AR walking courses.

The update is primarily aimed at improving location-based experiences on Spectacles.

Snap showcased a few examples that utilize the new capabilities, such as NavigatAR from Utopia Labs, which directs users with Snap Map Tiles by displaying glowing arrows to assist wearers in reaching their destinations.

Other new platform features for Spectacles include the aforementioned hand-tracking capabilities, which detect grab gestures and when a user has a phone in their hands. Snap also now lets developers easily add a leaderboard to their Lenses for competition-focused experiences.

Additionally, there‚Äôs a new AR keyboard.

In the above post, which serves as both an obituary and epitaph for the deceased PC, GoatWithAGun sensitively told those gathered around this virtual deathbed ‚ÄúAs of 2:14 PM Philippine Standard Time, my monitor lost signal from the PC and I returned to it completely unresponsive to any troubleshooting.‚Äù The Redditor graciously thanked those who had followed their fight to resuscitate the PC, and those who had donated.

Our previous coverage saw the efforts to update the BIOS of this PC‚Äôs BioStar A320MH motherboard extend past the 24-hour mark (flashing 66% complete). Actually, follow-up posts saw the Redditor start new threads at 48-hours+, and 100-hours+ before quiet darkness descended today.

It may be unfortunate what has happened to this PC, which the Redditor said they decided to BIOS-flash due to the lure of BioStar stability fixes. However, it shouldn‚Äôt be the end of the system, with replacement motherboards readily available. Other components of this system like the AMD Ryzen 3 1200 CPU, 4GB of DDR4-2400 Kingston HyperX memory, an Asus GTX 1660 GPU, a 128GB Transcend SATA SSD, and a 480GB Crucial SATA SSD are all likely unconcerned with the motherboard‚Äôs sticky end.

Before signing off, GoatWithAGun seemed to hint that they may soon have a new way to reanimate the dead BioStar A320MH motherboard. The Redditor said that a BIOS programmer is on the way (with a spare BIOS chip, we would hope). Thus, there may be a chance that this bricked single-BIOS device could rise again ‚Äì if the BIOS contents are the only hurdle to it being able to boot.

GoatWithAGun will probably announce the result of the BIOS programmer tinkering off of Reddit, due to a segment of the platform the Redditors says have ‚Äúgrown tired of me.‚Äù It‚Äôs a shame those folks couldn‚Äôt just go and read and comment on something else.",tomshardware

The trio, consisting of the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, Snapdragon G2 Gen 2, and Snapdragon G1 Gen 2, will power the next generation of offerings from OEMs, including Ayaneo, OneXPlayer, and Retroid Pocket.

The Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 leads the pack with an octa-core Kryo CPU consisting of one Prime, five Performance, and two Efficiency cores. It features the Adreno A32 GPU with ray tracing support. Qualcomm claims the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 offers 30% faster CPU performance and 28% better GPU performance than the previous generation, the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 from 2023.

Regarding features, the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 is Qualcomm's first G-series chip to embrace Lumen, Unreal Engine 5's fully dynamic global illumination and reflections system. The chip retains its predecessor's FastConnect 7800 module, offering Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.3 support. However, the upgraded Adreno A32, which likely features a higher clock speed, has allowed the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 to support displays up to QHD+ 144 Hz, upping the resolution from the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2.

Qualcomm Snapdragon G Series Specifications

The Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 will replace the previous Snapdragon G2 Gen 1. As usual, the new chip still sports an octa-core Kryo CPU, but the configuration differs. The layout comprises one Prime, four Performance, and three Efficiency cores. Qualcomm says CPU performance is 2.3X higher than the Snapdragon G2 Gen 1.

Qualcomm has also upgraded the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 GPU to the Adreno A22 instead of the Adreno A21. The company asserts that consumers can expect up to a 3.8X increase in graphics performance. This upgrade bumps the display support to QHD+ from the Snapdragon G2 Gen 1's FHD+.

Only the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 and Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 support Qualcomm's Snapdragon Game Super Resolution and Adreno Frame Motion Engine 2.0 technologies.

The Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 is the last chip in Qualcomm's new Snapdragon G series stack but receives an equally substantial upgrade. The octa-core Kryo CPU features two Performance and six Efficiency cores. The new configuration promises 80% better CPU performance. Meanwhile, the Adreno A12 offers 25% over the last-generation Adreno A11. We can witness this regarding display support, where the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2 is suitable for up to FHD+ 120 Hz as opposed to the Snapdragon G1 Gen 1's 1080p 60 Hz.

Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 has been confirmed to power three upcoming devices: the Ayaneo Pocket S2, the Ayaneo Gaming Pad, and the OneXPlayer OneXSugar.

The Ayaneo Pocket S2 is an Android-powered gaming handheld with a 6.3-inch IPS TrueColor display and a 1440p resolution. While Ayaneo claims a high-capacity battery for prolonged gaming sessions, the manufacturer didn't reveal the exact figure.

The Ayaneo Gaming Pad, on the other hand, is more of a tablet. The Android device has an 8.3-inch LCD with a 1440p resolution and 120 Hz refresh rate. The tablet flaunts a 50-megapixel rear camera and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide camera while having a 5-megapixel front snapper. It supports different peripherals, such as controllers or keyboards.

Meanwhile, the OneXSugar is like a combination of a Nintendo Switch and Nintendo DS. The gaming handheld has a dual-screen design: a 6.01-inch main screen and a 3.92-inch secondary screen.

Retroid Pocket's next-generation gaming handheld will leverage the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2. While the company didn't reveal the exact model, it's reasonable to assume that it should be the Retroid Pocket 6, the successor to the brand's overly popular Retroid Pocket 5.

The Retroid Pocket 5 came out a few months ago, sporting the Snapdragon 865 chip, which is a little long behind the tooth. The Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 should offer a significant upgrade.

Specification-wise, the Retroid Pocket Classic has 4GB of LPDDR4x-2133 memory and 64GB of eMMC 5.1 storage. This variant sells for $119, whereas the variant with 6GB LPDDR4x-2133 and 128GB eMMC 5.1 retails for $129. Preorders start today at 9:30 PM ET.",tomshardware

This allocation is the third-largest item in the budget, surpassed only by national defense and debt interest payments.

The increase in spending on science and technology by 10%, or $5 billion, emphasizes that China wants to accelerate its national R&D this year, which will speed up its plans for self-reliance in sectors such as semiconductors. $5 billion will not build the country a breakthrough but will rather help with existing projects, particularly in fields such as semiconductors, AI, space exploration, and quantum computing.

Also, remember that China's economy is slowing, and the government frequently disguises economic stimulus plans within large-scale initiatives like this, allowing it to avoid directly labeling it as a stimulus.

In 2024, China allocated ¬•361.9 billion for science and technology expenditures, achieving 97.6% of the budgeted target. The government increased support for fundamental research to strengthen China's capabilities in cutting-edge scientific discovery and technological innovation. Investment was directed into major national initiatives, particularly in strategic sectors such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and space exploration. Last year, China also introduced support for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), including special financing programs to assist innovative SMEs with risk-sharing mechanisms through national financing guarantee funds. In addition, tax reductions and subsidies were offered to tech enterprises to encourage innovation.

China plans to channel its science and technology spending on 'Science and Technology Innovation 2030' major projects targeting integrated circuits, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing technology. Governments tend to invest money into projects that may not pay off for years, so expect China to invest in fundamental research in the aforementioned areas. This will strengthen China's global competitiveness in these key industries in the coming years, which is particularly important for China's ongoing rivalry with the U.S.",tomshardware

One of the best processors for outright gaming, AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, with its hefty stacked 3D V-Cache, has been the in-demand CPU for gaming since its initial launch in January and has been very hard to get hold of. AMD even stated that they were trying to get weekly rollouts of stock to retailers to cope with the demand, but that didn't stop the CPU from disappearing almost instantly from website pages when new stock came in. Prices for the 9800X3D skyrocketed, with third-party resellers trying to cash in on the demand for this processor and charging egregious prices.

It's been two months, but finally, you can get hold of AMD's current-generation gaming king. Maybe it's the stock levels catching up, or perhaps the launch of the 9900X3D and 9950X3D CPUs recently has pulled away some of the demand on the 9800X3D, but, whatever the reason, if you're looking to build a top-of-the-line gaming rig, now, you can actually get your hands on this impressive CPU.

Available for its $479 MSRP launch price, you can find the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D for sale at Amazon, Newegg, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. I don't see any discounts coming for this super-popular processor anytime soon, but it's great to see the price come back to normal now that there is availability.

An Asus ROG Flow Z13 64GB was used for the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 test system, and an Asus Zenbook S14 32GB was used for the Core Ultra 7 258V test system.

In DeepSeek R1, the Ryzen chip was up to 2.1x faster (measured in tokens per second) than the Intel counterpart using Distill Qwen 1.5b, up to 2.2x faster using Distill Qwen 7b; up to 2.1x faster using Distill Llama 8b; and up to 2.2x faster using Distill Qwen 14b. In Phi 4 Mini Instruct 3.8b, the Ryzen chip was up to 2.1x faster than the Intel Lunar Lake chip; up to 2.2x faster in Phi 4 14b; and up to 2.1x faster in Llama 3.2 3b Instruct.

In the same LLM configurations but benchmarking the ""time to the first token,"" the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 was up to 12.2x faster in DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14b. The Zen 5 chip's least-performant dominance was in Phi 4 Mini Instruct 3.8b and Llama 3.2 3b Instruct, where the AMD chip was ""only"" 4x faster than the Core Ultra 7 258V.

AMD showed similar dominance in AI vision models using the same ""time to the first token"" benchmarking technique. In IBM Granite Vision 3.2 2B, the 395 was up to 7x faster than the 258V, up to 4.6x faster in Google Gemma 3.4b, and up to 6x faster in Google Gemma 3 12b.

AMD's benchmarks show complete dominance of its Ryzen AI Max+ 395 against the Core Ultra 7 258V in AI benchmarks. This is all thanks to the Ryzen AI Max CPU's significantly more powerful integrated graphics chip (which rivals discrete graphics with its 40 RDNA 3.5 CUs), eight more CPU cores, and its significantly higher configurable TDP (rated up to 120W). Even though it consumes significantly more power than the Core Ultra 7 258V (which has a max turbo power of 37W), both chips operate in the same market, and are compatible in the same thin-and-light category of laptop PCs.

It will be interesting to see how the new AMD mobile APUs shape up against Nvidia's RTX 50-series mobile GPUs, which are reportedly facing supply chain issues, delaying their launch in upcoming RTX 50 series gaming laptops. On a pure performance level (not considering form factor), these new Nvidia-powered systems will be AMD's primary competition.



AMD is allegedly well on its way to handling discrete GPU competition, as it already advertised superior AI performance on the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 against Nvidia's RTX 4090 laptop GPU.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Freeware image editor GIMP 3.0 arrives after seven years of incubation,https://www.tomshardware.com/software/freeware-image-editor-gimp-3-0-arrives-after-seven-years-of-incubation,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:00:59 GMT","A major update to GIMP (the GNU Image Manipulation Program) has arrived today. GIMP 3.0 has been finalized and released to relieve GIMP 2.10 from its duty as the premier free and open source image editing software for multiple platforms. We only recently crowned GIMP the standard for free image editors in a comprehensive comparison article. Now with version 3.0 hitting mainstream, it might become unassailable.

(Image credit: GIMP.org)

The GIMP Team's original focus with the introduction of the long-awaited version 3.0 of the photo editing application was to overhaul the user interface (UI). However, over the years since the last stable release, they have naturally piled up features, enhancements, and other tweaks.

Starting with the interface improvements, the GIMP Team say that the move to the GTK3 GUI library means that there is now ""much better UI scaling on Hi-DPI screens,"" which could be an issue with 2.10.

Users will also benefit from mouse wheel flipping between dockable dialogs, better dark theme support, and a way to tone down motion and animation UI effects. Moreover, tablets are now better supported. The new application runs natively on Wayland (and X11), and there are a host of other fixes in this domain.

Major new features

The release notes for GIMP 3.0 are extensive, but we think the highlights of the new release, beyond the UI, include the addition of features like the non-destructive layer effects, improved color management, bolstered file format support, and refined text support. GIMP's mascot, Wilber, has also had a new lick of paint.

The goodies don't stop there, as users will also see a multitude of usability improvements. Popular features such as Layers, Channels, and Paths have had developer attention, as have workflow concerns and shortcuts. It is also worth mentioning the introduction of off-canvas editing, where painting tools can auto-expand the canvas as you create.

Reenergized GIMP roadmap

GIMP 1.X reigned over the free photo editor category for eight years, while GIMP 2.X lasted 20, but the team behind the application want ""minor releases to be much more frequent,"" starting with version 3.X.

The GIMP Team says that users should expect GIMP 3.2 within a year. There may be fewer features between point releases, but they should get to users sooner. Last but not least, GIMP users are encouraged to join the community UX Design group to shape the future look and feel of the software.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash is reportedly capable of removing watermarks ‚Äî Also found to generate AI celebrity photos,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/googles-gemini-2-0-flash-is-reportedly-capable-of-removing-watermarks-also-found-to-generate-ai-celebrity-photos,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 14:52:11 GMT","Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model can reportedly remove watermarks from user-provided images and depict copyrighted characters/celebrities in generated images, claim users on Reddit (via ComputerBase). This includes licensed stock imagery found online, stamped with watermarks to indicate their copyrighted nature. This risks potential litigation from media licensing corporations. Limited testing on our end revealed that watermark removal was unsuccessful on several provided images, while the generation of celebrity images was possible.

Back in December, Google introduced native image output with Gemini 2.0 Flash for testing. Just last week, this update was made accessible across all regions, free of charge, and includes a slew of new features such as: telling a story with pictures, conversational image editing, world understanding, text rendering, and more. AI image generators have consistently faced scrutiny regarding ethical and moral considerations.

Companies like Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI typically integrate a set of guardrails or a list of dos and don'ts in their models to combat the misuse of their technologies. The restrictions stretch wide, but the general prohibitions typically include depictions of celebrities and notably the removal of watermarks from copyrighted material.

Recently, several Redditors found that Gemini's native image output feature extends to watermark removal from stock images, such as those from Getty Images, and celebrity image generation as well. In the first case, this probably violates multiple DMCA provisions as removing a watermark alters the CMI, which is information that identifies copyrighted work. The legality of generating celebrity images using AI is slightly more complex, primarily concerned over the protection of celebrities' rights of publicity and concerns surrounding deepfakes and potential defamation.

Even so, the removal of the watermark doesn't change the fact the image is likely protected by copyright law. So you can't expect to use these images commercially, as you'd probably be hit with a barrage of DMCA claims. In most cases, individuals may desire to remove the watermark, if said image is intended for personal use-cases.

Contrary to the Reddit thread, we were not able to remove watermarks from the same images, with Gemini responding, ""Unfortunately, I cannot directly edit images."" Conversational image editing works as intended in Google AI Studio, where Gemini managed to reproduce the image of a celebrity, so there's still some ironing out left to be done.

It's important to note that Google has tagged the image generation feature of Gemini 2.0 Flash as experimental. This may be why it's only available in Google AI Studio and not on Gemini's main site and could also explain these lapses in judgment.",tomshardware

That seems to be what maker and developer Pollux Labs has pulled off with their latest Raspberry Pi project. Using our favorite SBC and a little help from ChatGPT, Pollux Labs upgraded a rotary phone to interact with those who call using speech recognition and text to speech for responses.

According to Pollux Labs, the project merges both vintage technology and the thrill of modern AI. To use the system, all you have to do is dial a specific number which then enables the speech to text function. You can talk with the ChatGPT AI in a full conversation that will be remembered so you can call again later and pick up where you left off.

The phone doesn't work as a regular phone but rather is monitored entirely by a Raspberry Pi. When the receiver is triggered, a dial tone sound is played like you would normally expect. However, it's up to you to call the AI program and engage with a futuristic experience that can only be accomplished with modern LLMs and a spark of ingenuity. So while you do retain much of the original experience using the handheld speaker and rotary dial, there's a huge element of modernity oozing out of the system.

The project is driven by a Raspberry Pi 4B but you could get better performance using the latest Raspberry Pi 5. The Pi is housed inside of the old rotary phone along with a few components that bring the project together including a microphone that listens for audio which can then be parsed through the AI channel.

The software was put together by Pollux Labs just for this project and is primarily driven by a Python script that interacts with other services like the Whisper API from OpenAI to handle the ChatGPT interactions. It also maintains the conversation history and converts responses from ChatGPT into speech for the rotary phone to output.

https://tomshardware.com,MSI Afterburner update enables RTX 50 series owners to push their GDDR7 VRAM up to 36 GT/s,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/msi-afterburner-update-enables-rtx-50-series-owners-to-push-their-gddr7-vram-up-to-36-gt-s,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:18:29 GMT","One of the things that Nvidia does not exactly encourage its partners among add-in-board (AIB) manufacturers to do is to 'factory overclock' memory on graphics cards featuring its GPUs. However, it looks like MSI's Alexei 'Unwinder' has managed to unlock this possibility for GDDR7 memory on GeForce RTX 50-series products, as noticed by VideoCardz. Good news, it works for all GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards. But, as always, there is a catch.

A new unofficial update for MSI Afterburner enables RTX 50-series GPU owners to push their memory overclocking limits by an additional 3 GT/s, achieving data transfer rates of up to 36 GT/s. While some may say that a mere 10% overclock ‚Äî especially in the case of the GeForce RTX 5090 that has a wide memory interface and barely needs that extra bandwidth ‚Äî is not a big deal, this is not as simple as it sounds.

GDDR7 memory ICs available today from Micron, Samsung, and SK hynix are rated for an up to 28 GT/s ‚Äî 32 GT/s (Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung have GDDR7, but the latter does not disclose its specs). Nvidia recommends reducing data transfer rates to 28 GT/s (except for RTX 5080, which is set to 30 GT/s), though the chips can handle higher speeds, which is where Unwinder's achievement represents a breakthrough as it 'unlocks' available capabilities of the memory chips.

This is particularly significant for GeForce RTX 5080-series boards that come with 32 GT/s chips that are 'down-clocked' to 30 GT/s by default. However, keep in mind that on the GPU side there are memory controller peculiarities and this represents risks in terms of overclocking.

The new update involves replacing a specific database file and is compatible only with MSI Afterburner version 4.6.6 Beta 5 Build 16555. Although this update might eventually be integrated into a future beta version, it remains to be seen when exactly this happens. Some users have instead turned to GPU Tweak III, Asus's software, which supports both AMD and Nvidia GPUs and avoids known bugs present in MSI Afterburner.

Ultimately, both MSI Afterburner and GPU Tweak III can now support GDDR7 memory overclocking on GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards. This is especially beneficial for the GeForce RTX 5080-series users who aim to maximize performance beyond the default 30 GT/s limit. With the modified database, pushing speeds beyond 32 GT/s should now be achievable without issues.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,AMD manager reports 45% GPU retail market share in Japan ‚Äî Eyes 70% as the next target,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-manager-reports-45-percent-gpu-retail-market-share-in-japan-eyes-70-percent-as-the-next-target,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 12:50:24 GMT","AMD recently held an event titled 'Spring New Product Launch' in Akihabara, Tokyo, which drew influencers and partner representatives to showcase and comment on the company's latest Radeon RX 9000 and Ryzen 9000X3D offerings. Facing questions about RDNA 4 supply, AMD Japan's Marketing Manager Yoshiaki Sato claimed (machine translation) that Radeon has boosted its market share in the country to 45% with RDNA 4, the highest it's ever been.

AMD had high ambitions for this generation, and Nvidia's woes made it the perfect opportunity to strike and increase its dwindling market share. Admittedly, supply constraints have spoiled the value of these RX 9070 series GPUs, of which the flagship is within reach of the RTX 5070 Ti at a more affordable MSRP. Of course, this generation, retailers are interpreting the 'suggested' part in MSRP quite literally. While AMD has attributed these stockouts to unprecedented demand, the RX 9070 XT ($599 MSRP) typically starts at $800 depending on the retailer.

The session was joined by popular influencers who praised AMD's Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs for low temperatures but also expressed a desire for more I/O on the motherboards. Afterward, Ms. Saki Suzuki and Mr. Sato from AMD gathered at a roundtable, side-by-side with board representatives from ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, PowerColor and Sapphire.

The board partners, despite wanting to sell more Radeon GPUs, reported they lacked the production capacity to meet demand. Mr. Sato, responding to the point raised, stated, ""AMD isn't used to selling [so many] graphics cards."" This was later followed up by an important statistic, with Mr. Sato reporting a 45% retail market share for Radeon GPUs. ""We're the opposition party, so let's aim for 70%,"" said Mr. Sato, though such high ambitions require a reliable and steady supply chain. These comments are recorded in this video, starting from four hours, seven and a half minutes.

It's important to understand this figure is quite vague. We presume it refers to the share of Radeon GPUs sold in Japan since earlier this month, when RDNA 4 hit shelves. The best global statistic we have is from the Steam Hardware Survey, where Radeon's market share (including iGPUs) plummeted to 11.5% in February. If AMD manages to offer RDNA 4 at MSRP, whether it be by ramping up production or offering rebates, we could probably see this number tick up. At least that's what AMD hoped to achieve this generation.",tomshardware

Raspberry Pi has confirmed that DigiKey and Mouser will be providing RP2350s to eager makers in the United States.

Updated Article

The Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and the Pico 2 W have been on sale for a number of months now, but the chip that powers it, the RP2350 has not been generally available. This has all changed with Raspberry Pi releasing the RP2350 for general sale for those eager to integrate the powerful microcontroller into their projects.

If you want your own RP2350 for a project, then you can pick them up from approved Raspberry Pi resellers. Just visit the official page and click on the Buy Now button in the top right. UK reseller Pimoroni offers a bundle of 10 RP2350A chips for ¬£8.80 ($9) and 10 RP2350B for ¬£9.60 ($10). If you need a smaller amount, The Pi Hut is offering a five-pack of the RP2350A for ¬£4.40 ($4.50) and a five-pack of RP2350B for ¬£4.80 ($5).

The RP235X comes in four different options, but at this time only the RP2350A and B will be going on general sale. The first is the $1.10 RP2350A. This is what we find on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and Pico 2 W. The QFN-60 package has no internal flash, 30 GPIO pins, of which there are four analog inputs. The $1.20 RP2350B is a larger, QFN-80 package. There still isn't any onboard flash, but we do get more GPIO pins (48 in total) of which eight are analog inputs. We've got a full breakdown of all the RP235X models, their specs and a full list of GPIO pins in our handy guide. Note that the RP2354A and B are not on general sale. They should be on sale later this year.

All the RP2350s come with the same Dual-Core Arm Cortex M33 and RISC-V Hazard3 CPUs running at 150 MHz, and we have 4MB of onboard SRAM to run our projects. If you are designing your own boards based on the RP2350, then you could add some PSRAM (Pseudo Static RAM) to give your projects extra space to run. Storage for the RP2350 boards is via an external QSPI chip.

The choice of CPUs in the RP2350 is intriguing. The first is the traditional Dual-Core Arm Cortex M33 that has plenty of power to get the job done. But there is also a Dual-Core RISC-V Hazard3 CPU, marking the first time that a RISC-V chip has been integrated into a Raspberry Pi product. The chip was designed by Raspberry Pi's own Luke Wren, as a project in his spare time. The Hazard3 chip is a fork of the Hazard5, another Wren project, designed for the RISCboy open source Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Wren has been working on logic design since he was a student, and the fruits of his labor are now for all to see. Could we see more RISC-V chips baked into Raspberry Pi? Possibly, but the traditional Arm CPU used in the Raspberry Pi 5 will be here for some time to come.

If you want to make your own RP2350-powered projects, but don't have the facilities to fabricate your own PCBs, Raspberry Pi has recently announced that JCLPCB are offering the RP230A and B for inclusion in your own projects. The RP2354A and B (with internal flash) will be available later this year. So now all you need to do is fire up your favorite EDA package and start designing your very own RP2350 projects.",tomshardware

The event focuses on the concept of the 'CUDA moat,' and how developers can optimize their AI-centric workloads using other alternatives. Attendees can expect to see demonstrations, hot takes, panels, and expert opinions from influential leaders in the AI field including computer architect icons like Jim Keller and Raja Koduri.

It's no secret that Nvidia-built GPUs constitute the majority of hardware in the AI space. Although AMD's Instinct accelerators offer performance comparable to Nvidia hardware, the already-established and mature CUDA ecosystem is indispensable to some users / organizations. Nvidia realized the potential of parallel computing on its GPUs early on and developed a proprietary platform dubbed CUDA, which is now the de facto standard for GPU-accelerated computing.

Through continuous efforts, optimizations, and the sudden rise of AI which coincidentally is powered by GPUs, Nvidia has positioned itself as a leading solution provider. In fact, 90% of Nvidia's revenue is now driven by its data-center offerings, with CUDA being a central selling point. This creates a vendor lock-in situation, where CUDA (software) effectively confines the industry to Nvidia's hardware, limiting innovation and competition.

The industry is shifting gears to a more open-source and hardware-agnostic future, but that's easier said than done. We have OpenCL, ROCm, oneAPI, and Vulkan as alternatives, however, each trails Nvidia in one or many aspects. Enter Beyond CUDA, where key figures in the AI field have rallied up to congregate and develop a more diverse and heterogeneous future. Hosted by TensorWave, the Beyond CUDA Summit will address the many challenges the AI computing industry faces, such as hardware flexibility, cost efficiency, and exploring the available alternatives to CUDA.

Platforms like ROCm require significant developments to achieve parity with CUDA. Even now, ROCm only supports a small selection of modern GPUs while CUDA maintains compatibility with hardware dating back to 2006. AMD's latest RDNA 4 GPUs are still not officially supported by ROCm. Developers have long bemoaned AMD's slow adoption of new features and support on new hardware. On the positive side, Strix Halo is now ROCm-compatible, though only on Windows.

If you live in San Jose, buckle up as the summit takes place at The Guildhouse, which is with notable irony just three blocks away from the McEnery Convention Center, the site of Nvidia's GTC, which also commences today. Participants have the opportunity to win an AMD Instinct MI210 GPU with 64GB of HBM2e memory. The event runs from 12 PM to 10 PM PDT, with four time slots for various sessions. You can learn more details about the summit here.",tomshardware

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

The mechanical keyboard market has been flooded with pre-built keyboards featuring magnetic switches over the past year ‚Äî it seems like a new 75-percent magnetic switch keyboard boasting Rapid Trigger and Snap Tap comes out every week. But because magnetic switches are largely aimed at gamers, we haven't seen a lot of magnetic switch gaming keyboards that are larger than 75-percent.

We've seen some ‚Äî like Glorious' wildly-expensive custom-built GMMK 3 series. And now, the Keydous NJ98-CP V2 HE, which is a much more budget-friendly option. This almost-full-size keyboard (96-percent layout, or 98 keys), may not have a full aluminum case, but it's got a numberpad that turns into a calculator, a programmable rotary knob, and a programmable, detachable screen. (Just because.)

It's wireless and features a hot-swappable PCB that accepts both magnetic switches and mechanical switches, which is handy considering the lack of standardization in the magnetic switch market at the moment ‚Äî you can always fall back on your favorite mechanical switches.

Designed to compete with the best mechanical keyboards , the NJ98-CP V2 HE is available now for $150 ‚Äî not exactly budget-priced, but less than half the price of other full-size options.

Design and Construction of the NJ98-CP V2 HE

The NJ98-CP V2 HE is a wireless magnetic switch keyboard with a 96-percent layout ‚Äî it's designed to give you almost all of the functionality of a full-size keyboard in a more compact form. The keyboard has a full function row and a full numberpad, as well as three of the navigation keys (Delete, PgUp, and PgDn), as well as a dedicated calculator key. The numberpad is also squeezed closer to the arrow keys, and has a 1u 0 key to fit. The keyboard also features a volume knob (programmable) in the upper right corner, which is next to a detachable magnetic docking screen.

By default, this screen displays a number of stats (Num lock, Caps lock, battery life, connection, and time), as well as a gif of a cat (which is cute, I guess). You can customize this screen with your own images or gifs using the keyboard's companion software, similar to the screen seen on the Asus ROG Azoth and ROG Azoth Extreme .

This screen also acts as a screen for the keyboard's built-in calculator function, which you can access by hitting Fn + Numpad Enter. I'll admit this is pretty handy if you... well, frequently need a calculator, though I wish the shortcut was easier to hit one-handed (I can hit it one-handed, but it's not convenient). Also, the dedicated calculator key, which opens up your PC's onscreen calculator, seems like overkill in addition to this feature (how many calculators do you need?!).

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The screen is easily removable ‚Äî it just pulls off, though the magnet is strong enough that you shouldn't have to worry about accidentally knocking it loose. I'm not sure why the screen is removable, as it doesn't work on its own, but Keydous does sell replacement screens in different colors (light pink, light green, and khaki) on its website for $20, so I suppose it's just another way to customize your build.

The keyboard is housed in a plastic chassis with a slightly textured matte finish, which is not the fanciest-looking (or feeling) chassis material. The keyboard comes in six colorways: white (white case, white keycaps, light blue and orange accent keys), black samurai (black case, black keycaps, yellow accent keys), pale green (white case, cream keycaps, green accent keys), star dream (white case, gray-to-black ombre keycaps, translucent teal accent keys), and shadow (gray-to-black ombre keycaps with shine-through side legends) with either a white or a black case. Our review unit was in star dream, which has dye-sub PBT keycaps in a Cherry keycap profile.

The keyboard measures 15.87 inches (403mm) wide by 5.43 inches (138mm) deep, and is approximately 1.57 inches (40mm) thick at its thickest point (including keycaps). It's slightly larger than the Asus ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless (14.84 x 5.16 x 1.57 inches / 377 x 131 x 40mm), because it adds the navigation keys in a column next to the numberpad (instead of along the top, like the Strix Scope II 96 Wireless does).

The roomier layout is nice for those who frequently use the numberpad, though the overall compact layout will still take some getting used to if you're moving from a full-size keyboard. You can get this keyboard with either an aluminum or a brass positioning plate (brass costs $15 more); our review unit with its aluminum plate weighed in at 2.52 pounds (1,144g) ‚Äî solid, but not particularly heavy.

On the back of the keyboard, you'll find four small anti-slip rubber pads, as well as a set of flip-out feet to change the keyboard's typing angle. This is a nice feature, as a lot of the magnetic switch keyboards we've been looking at recently have had aluminum cases and no angle adjustment. The power switch is also located on the back of the keyboard, which is a little inconvenient if you frequently turn your keyboard on and off ‚Äî but at least the keyboard is fairly lightweight and so the switch is not too much of a hassle to get to. Finally, there's a little slot for the keyboard's 2.4GHz wireless USB-A dongle, which is small and unassuming (a little too unassuming ‚Äî there's no label on the USB dongle at all, and I immediately forgot what it belonged to).

In the box, the keyboard comes with a keycap puller, a switch puller, and a 5-foot (1.5m) rubber USB-C to USB-A cable. It also comes with extra keycaps (Mac keys and accent key replacements), a 2.4GHz wireless USB-A dongle, and a USB extender.

Typing and Gaming Experience on the NJ98-CP V2

The NJ98-CP V2 HE comes with magnetic switches, but the hot-swappable PCB supports both magnetic and mechanical switches (3- and 5-pin) ‚Äî like Glorious' magnetic GMMK 3 ‚Äî and you can mix magnetic and mechanical switches.

It comes with Kailh Ice Cream Magnetic Switch V2 switches, which are linear magnetic switches with an initial force of 30gf and a total travel of 4mm. They have all the features that magnetic switches have: adjustable actuation (between 0.1 and 4.0mm), Rapid Trigger, Dynamic Keystrokes, and SnapTap, which you can set up and configure in the Keydous Driver companion app.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Typing on the NJ98-CP V2 HE feels and sounds quite good ‚Äî the switches are smooth, consistent, and stable, and the stabilizers are well-lubed. The case comes with three layers of foam inside, which do a very good job of dampening sound and absorbing any case ping.

While it's not the absolute best-sounding keyboard we've tested, the aluminum positioning plate combined with the sound-dampening foam makes for a nice, crisp, consistent overall sound ‚Äî except for the space bar. The space bar has a deeper, somewhat out-of-place ""thock"" to it, which is noticeable but not so much so that it's overly distracting.

The keycaps that came with the star dream colorway are made of dye-sublimated PBT and have a Cherry keycap profile. The Cherry keycap profile is relatively low-profile with sculpted rows, for a comfortable, easy-travel typing experience. These keycaps have slightly curved tops and a lightly-textured finish that's just slippery enough for speedy typing ‚Äî I was able to consistently hit around 130 wpm with 99% accuracy on this keyboard right out of the box.

The keycaps vary slightly depending on which colorway you get ‚Äî the star dream, pale green, black, and white colorways have Cherry profile keycaps, while the two shadow colorways have OEM profile keycaps.

For productivity, this keyboard's built-in calculator does seem to be pretty handy. However, when you go into calculator mode by pressing Fn + Numpad Enter, you can't enter any input on the keyboard until you leave calculator mode ‚Äî so you can't enter the numbers into your PC without exiting calculator mode, and exiting calculator mode clears the calculator. I suppose maybe that's why there's also a dedicated calculator button on this keyboard ‚Äî in case you need to enter in your numbers on your computer.

But, of course, this is a keyboard ‚Äî how often are you not going to be using your computer when you're using this calculator? While I did think this feature was pretty neat at first, I now think you probably don't really need it alongside a dedicated calculator button. But maybe there's some use case I'm not considering.

For gaming, the NJ98-CP HE V2 is as solid as any other magnetic switch keyboard. It has a solid, 1,000 Hz polling rate over both its 2.4GHz wireless connection and its wired connection, and game mode (Fn + Windows Key) is built in.

It also offers adjustable actuation, which lets you adjust the point at which the key actuates (individually for each key, if you like), as well as Rapid Trigger, which matches the key's actuation point to its de-actuation point, so you can press it down as soon as you let go of it, without having to wait for it to pass a specific de-actuation point. The keyboard's low,

Cherry profile keycaps and linear magnetic switches make it easy to quickly glide across the keyboard, but the keyboard itself is perhaps a little too big for most gamers. However, if you're a gamer like me and you need all the buttons, the NJ98-CP V2 HE is probably one of your only options on the market.

Features and Software of the NJ98-CP V2 HE

You can configure the NJ98-CP V2 using the Keydous Driver, which is available both as a download and a web app. It is pretty clearly translated from Chinese, and all the documentation is also translated from Chinese, which makes it a little confusing and convoluted at times.

You can turn on and adjust the keyboard's magnetic switch settings ‚Äî actuation point, Rapid Trigger, Dynamic Keystrokes, Toggle Keys, Snap Tap, etc. and also calibrate the switches when you've swapped in new magnetic or mechanical switches. The software also lets you remap and configure keys (on multiple layers) and the rotary knob, and includes a built-in macro recorder.

You can also customize the screen with your own pictures or animations. The software is actually pretty impressive here, if perhaps a little unnecessarily detailed ‚Äî you can upload your own images or gifs, or you can draw things on the ""draw board"" and save them to the hardware ‚Äî and your drawings can have colors and multiple frames.

I didn't spend too much time exploring this, but it is kind of neat if you love customization. You can also upload and share your presets ‚Äî whether they're keymaps, drawings, or lighting effects ‚Äî with others in the Keydous Driver community.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The keyboard has bright RGB lighting with per-key configuration using the app. It comes with several presets (and you can also do some limited customization directly from the keyboard using shortcuts), but you can also change each individual key's lighting (if you like) and you can save lighting effects to different layers (so, for example, you know what profile you're currently using).

Wireless Performance and Battery Life of the NJ98-CP V2 HE

The NJ98-CP V2 offers three forms of connectivity: low-latency 2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired via USB-C. It offers a solid 1,000 Hz polling rate over both 2.4GHz wireless and wired connections, which is the standard for gaming keyboards ‚Äî though we've recently seen a few magnetic switch keyboards with ultra-high polling rates (such as the Luminkey Magger 68 HE and the Lemokey L5 HE 8K ).

Keydous rates the NJ98-CP V2 HE's battery life at around 800 hours in power saving mode ‚Äî that is, with the screen and the lighting turned off. With the screen and the lighting set to ""always on,"" the keyboard gets just 29 hours (which is pretty respectable considering ""always on"" means never sleeping). The screen displays the battery life by default, but if you change the screen or turn it off, you'll still get a low battery warning at less than 10% thanks to a red light under the F12 key.

The Bottom Line

There really aren't very many full-size magnetic switch gaming keyboards on the market ‚Äî and this technically isn't even full-size, either. So if you're the kind of person who needs a numberpad or just a lot of extra keys, your options are pretty limited.",tomshardware
https://zdnet.com,Will AI redefine digital marketing?,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230410/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","Salesforce Japan has released the ""Trends Report for Medium-sized and Small Businesses"" (6th edition). With the rapid development of autonomous AI agents, it has become clear how medium-sized and small and medium-sized enterprises aiming to grow are trying to utilize AI.

The report is based on surveys conducted on 3,350 medium-sized and small business leaders in 26 countries, including 200 in Japan.

The survey found that 75% of mid-sized and small businesses around the world are either experimenting with AI or already using it in earnest with the aim of improving profitability, improving productivity, and improving customer experience. The main uses of AI in medium-sized and small businesses in Japan include optimizing marketing campaigns, predicting marketing audiences, automating campaign analysis and generating new content.

In addition, 88% of Japanese medium-sized and small businesses that have adopted AI responded that their revenues have increased. Meanwhile, 39% of leaders are concerned that they will fall behind in the competition to utilize AI. The top concerns regarding AI include poor data quality, security risks, and lack of strategies and use cases.

https://zdnet.com,"AI chatbots collect the most user data ""Gemini""",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230559/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 09:59:00 GMT","There is growing concern about Chinese-made artificial intelligence (AI) models like DeepSeek, but there is a new study that suggests that the anxiety may be overstated, at least when it comes to data privacy. In fact, some popular US-based AI chatbots may collect user personal information more than DeepSeek.

Data released in February 2025 by well-known VPN provider Surfshark has revealed that Google Gemini is the most data-intensive AI chat app. In contrast, DeepSeek ranked fifth out of the 10 popular apps surveyed.

The research team analyzed detailed privacy-related information about Apple's top popular chatbots, ChatGPT, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok, Jasper, Poe, Claude, and Pi. We then compared the types of data that each app collects, such as whether it collects data associated with users and whether it contains third-party advertisers in the app.

This survey led to the determination that Google Gemini collects much more personal information than its competitors. Of the 35 types of user data, Gemini collects 22 types of data, including location data, user content, device contact information, and browsing history that require careful attention. This is significantly more than the data collected by other popular chatbots covered in the survey.

Only Gemini, Copilot, and Perplexity were collecting detailed location data, but about 30% of the chatbots surveyed shared sensitive user data, such as location information and browsing history, with third parties such as data brokers.

Additionally, 30% of the chatbots surveyed track user data. In particular, Copilot, Poe and Jasper collect data to track users. This means that user data collected from the app is associated with third-party data for the purposes of targeting ads and ad metrics.

https://zdnet.com,Get away from the IT department where you are busy with daily work -- thoroughly automating IT-related tasks,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230311/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT","Is Japan's digital transformation (DX) really achieving results? The analysis results of the 2024 DX Awareness Survey - IT Modernization Edition, published by PwC Consulting in December 2024 showed that only 41% of companies responded that ""DX results are as expected or even greater.""

In other words, more than half of the companies have not yet achieved sufficient results. This series will resume with the aim of using the results of the latest research to find out the cause, focusing on the barriers faced in implementing DX and the situations that are likely to fall into, and providing readers with tips on how to overcome the current situation.

Introduction

Looking at the situation of clients we have supported so far, there are many cases where people in the IT department of Japanese companies are unable to reserve the time even if they want to acquire new technologies and knowledge. The aforementioned investigation also highlights the reality that Japanese companies are trying to advance DX, but ""we are so busy with our daily work that we can't find time.""

Why is Japan's IT department so busy? We'll consider how we can get out of our busy schedule.

IT development and operation is still being carried out by a lot of manual work

There are many reasons why IT departments are busy every day, but the complicated management tasks and repetitive tasks in system operation are central factors. These tasks not only place a heavy burden on human resources when performed manually, but also increase the risk of human error. This is where automation is attracting attention. By utilizing automation technology, the efficiency of standard operations and the reduction of mistakes will be improved, creating an environment where IT staff can focus on more sophisticated and strategic issues. Below, we will explain in detail with specific examples.

In recent years, public clouds (hereinafter referred to as clouds) have become the mainstream in system development. Unlike traditional on-premises, the cloud can technically create new environments and change resources in just a few minutes. However, in reality, it is not uncommon for developers to apply for new use of the environment, but it takes more than a few weeks for the actual product to be provided.

When we explore the reasons for this, there are steps such as accepting applications, confirming parameters, checking consistency with internal security standards, checking settings and preparing work, building them, and finally, testing whether the settings are set as designed, and each step takes 2-3 days. The current situation is that what could normally be provided in just a few minutes has been spent incredible amounts of time by going through these steps.

To overcome this situation, it is necessary to move away from manual work in infrastructure construction and operational work and promote automation as much as possible. As a specific step, first code the infrastructure settings like software (Infrastructure as Code: IaC) and prepare the necessary settings as a template. In this case, the base template is prepared in advance with settings that follow the company's internal security standards and authority policies, and tests are automated, making it possible to provide an environment that complies with the company's internal regulations at an early stage and without human intervention. As an example, the Digital Agency has prepared an automatic environmental provision template (IaC template) as part of its Government Cloud initiative, enabling the provision of a cloud environment in a short period of time. Please use this as a reference.

The next step is to utilize continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools. CI/CD is becoming more familiar with application development, but by converting IaC in the infrastructure field, it also incorporates the CI/CD style, and like applications, tests are automatically performed when environment changes, and it is automatically provisioned at a time when quality is guaranteed. CI/CD reduces the number of manual tasks that were performed during conventional system updates, from checking the extent of impact to running tests and releasing to production environments.

In this way, by utilizing IaC and CI/CD, we can expect not only to automate environment construction and operational operations, but also to significantly reduce lead times. In addition, automation will increase the number of work that can be handled per person, and even if new uses or changes are increased in the future, it will be possible to handle it with minimal personnel.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,"Vietnam's largest FPT software, ranks in the top 20 sales in Japan",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230408/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","Vietnam's largest IT company, FPT Software, is putting even more effort into developing the Japanese market. Do Van Khac, president and CEO of FPT Japan Holdings, revealed in late February that Japan's sales grew at an average annual rate of over 30%, reaching approximately 72.8 billion yen in 2024. The company plans to grow 31% in fiscal 2025, aiming to join the top 20 sales companies in Japan.



Do Van Khac, CEO of FPT Japan Holdings Do Van Khac, CEO of FPT Japan Holdings

There are several policies that are growing. The first is geopolitical risk management. To put it simply, from the perspective of economic security, there is a movement to transfer software development outside of China, mainly Japanese financial institutions, due to the withdrawal of offshore development and shrinking the scale. ""We'll help you do it smoothly,"" Khac said.

The second is AI and GPU support. FPT Software has established a strong partnership relationship with NVIDIA in the US and provides cloud services and other services in Vietnam and other countries. As part of this, Japan has installed 127 GPUs, including the NVIDIA H100, which it has procured from a data center in Inzai City, Chiba Prefecture, and will begin providing cloud infrastructure and cloud services. Financial services SBI Holdings will invest in FPT Smart Cloud Japan, a subsidiary responsible for this, to meet the growing demand for AI and data centers.

The third is the automotive business. Khac said he is working on developing a navigation app with Tier 1 automotive companies that handle direct transactions with automakers. In addition, in order to accommodate software-defined vehicles (SDVs) by Japanese car manufacturers, the company will establish bases in Nagoya, Tochigi, Gunma, Shizuoka, and other areas, aiming to achieve sales of 20 billion yen in Japan by fiscal 2025.

The fourth is legacy migration. In March 2025, they launched COBOL PARK with SCSK, and a team of young FPT Software personnel and senior SCSK personnel will work on migrating the ""COBOL"" program that runs on the mainframe. They also use their own migration tools. In 2018, SCSK established a collaborative relationship in the IT services business in the Asia-Pacific region, and former SCSK president Tanihara Toru has served as chairman of the board of directors of the Japanese subsidiary.

The fifth is going to be the ERP business. We will strengthen support for the implementation and customization of SAP's S/4 HANA and Microsoft's Dynamics 365. First, by 2027, we will have approximately 3,000 SAP engineers, 10 times the current number. As the 2027 issue, when maintenance support for ""SAP ERP6.0"" ends, is approaching, we are hoping for a great business opportunity to move to S/4 HANA.

Acquiring and developing human resources is also essential to implementing these measures. The Japanese subsidiary will employ approximately 1,000 people per year, and by the end of fiscal year 2025, the number will be approximately 5,000 people. They work with over 100 recruitment agencies and send Vietnamese engineers to Japan. In fact, FPT University in Vietnam, run by FPT Software's Vietnam headquarters, produces approximately 10,000 graduates a year, with about 25% of whom joining group companies such as FPT Software. Among them, engineers who have acquired Japanese come to Japan and respond in Vietnam. Incidentally, there are currently about 1,300 Japanese people working in the Japanese subsidiary.

Human resource acquisition and training measures include mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and launching joint ventures. Recently, NAC (NAC), which has approximately 120 employees working on contract development, has become a wholly owned subsidiary. They also create engineers from Japanese IT companies that have participated in capital and are also rekilled to acquire new technologies, such as using AI. Konica Minolta also established a copier software development company, and Oki Electric Industries (OKI) also took capital into a software development company run by FPT Software in China. In addition, we will also consider capital participation in infrastructure building companies with 100 to 500 employees and consulting companies that can respond to Japanese language. It is said that more than 20 Japanese partner companies will also be included.

Khac, Senior Executive Vice President of FPT Software, is now in his fourth year as president of the Japanese corporation, and is looking to build a solid foundation of growth.",zdnet

It will make lending operations at financial institutions one-flow and more efficient, helping them improve productivity and reduce costs.

Specifically, Hitachi will link the ""Lending DX Promotion Service for Financial Institutions"" provided by Japan with the ""Digital Services Platform for Financial Services (DSP),"" a microservice platform provided by IBM Japan. This will include a process for enquiring customer information and credit, which financial institutions have accessed individual accounting systems in the past in a series of lending operations, as part of the expansion of the functions of the loan DX service.

Hitachi, IBM Japan, and Amazon Web Services Japan (AWS Japan) have begun co-creation studies on DX promotion, aiming to improve value by solving problems for regional financial institutions and revitalize the region since September 2024. This expansion of the functionality of the lending DX service is part of this.



Image of service collaboration (provided by Hitachi) Image of service collaboration (provided by Hitachi)

Loan operations also play an important role in the operations of financial institutions, and there is an urgent need to digitalize contracts and shift to web channels. On the other hand, this process requires cooperation with accounting systems, making it difficult to deal with, and traditional business flows such as terminal operations and paper media remain. In addition, until now, financial institutions have closely linked various channel systems and external solutions to core accounting systems, and when new services are added, it has been an obstacle to timely service provision, as the accounting systems need to be renovated.

With Loan DX Services, we have previously handled a series of operations, such as electronic contracts and transitioning to web channels, by linking with peripheral systems. With this expansion of functions, real-time data inquiry can be made possible by linking loan DX service and DSP to the business flow related to customer information and credit inquiries that exist within the accounting system.

In addition, by linking the loan DX service and DSP on AWS' cloud services, the transaction menu and service provided will be expanded as a common cloud service, allowing each financial institution to choose a service that suits its bank's needs.

In the future, Hitachi and IBM Japan will continue to work on improving the efficiency of loan application procedures, as well as changing the wide range of loan operations through collaboration between loan DX services and DSPs.

https://zdnet.com,Hitachi develops technology to strengthen manufacturing supply chains -- countermeasures against natural disasters and pandemics,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230562/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:54:00 GMT","Hitachi (Hitachi) announced that it has developed a ""deep insight estimation technology"" to deal with supply chain disruptions caused by natural disasters and pandemics. This technology utilizes the generated AI to estimate the manufacturing bases of suppliers with high accuracy, allowing for quick responses when risks occur.

This technology uses generated AI to collect and accumulate in-company and open data in real time, and associate and estimate it to extract insights that people cannot imagine. Part supply information such as part type name, material, and company name of the supplier, as well as company information published on the website, is input into the generation AI to estimate the manufacturing base information. A verification within the Hitachi Group confirmed that manufacturing base information can be estimated with an accuracy of over 85%.

This technology can significantly reduce the huge amount of information collected and narrowing down by hand when a risk occurs, such as an earthquake or a typhoon. For example, in the event of an earthquake, it is possible to quickly identify manufacturing bases in areas with high shaking, and take measures such as increasing inventory and securing alternative sources.

In the production base estimation work, first, the location and part information obtained from contract information at the time of procurement are converted into product codes and attached information using the product code system. The generated AI is then used to extract information that can be a manufacturing base from open data such as the official company website, ISO authentication information, and map information. Ultimately, the intermediate list created from the information obtained in the previous stage is processed to ensure consistency and accuracy, and estimate the supplier's manufacturing base at the latitude and longitude levels.

According to Hitachi, the risks of impacting supply chains, such as natural disasters, pandemics and geopolitical conflicts, have increased in recent years. In particular, in manufacturing, which has a large number of suppliers, risk management and strengthening resilience are important issues.

The company is working in collaboration with the University of Tokyo Digital Observership Research Promotion Agency to visualize procurement risks by capturing risks that will affect manufacturing. This will help to improve the efficiency of risk management and contribute to the strengthening of the supply chain of companies.

In the future, we aim to visualize supply chain risk by integrating the technology with diverse risk information and signaling through joint research with the University of Tokyo. Furthermore, we will promote the social implementation of risk management systems/services through collaboration with government and partners.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,Joint demonstration experiments at various stations of Ajira and Tokyu Railway - To improve behavior detection and AI accuracy,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230561/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:53:00 GMT","Azilla announced that in cooperation with Tokyu, Tokyu Corporation and Tokyu Security, it has begun a ""joint image analysis joint demonstration experiment using behavior recognition AI."" In this demonstration experiment, footage of security cameras installed inside and at various Tokyu Railway stations is analyzed using the AI ‚Äã‚Äãsecurity system ""AI Security asilla,"" developed by Ajira, to detect abnormal behavior such as troubles and falls.

AI Security asilla is a system equipped with Azilla's unique behavior recognition AI engine. It can be used simply by connecting it to an existing security camera. The AI ‚Äã‚Äãanalyzes the video around the clock and notifies security guards of abnormal behavior or suspicious people when it detects them. This reduces the burden on security guards and allows for efficient and effective security systems to be established.

Using the patented ""discomfort detection,"" AI autonomously learns its actions from the images of each camera, and detects movements that are different from normal as ""discomfort."" AI constantly monitors the video, allowing users to detect and notify small movements that people may miss. The existing camera can be used as is, which reduces initial costs. A single server can process up to 50 camera images, allowing for low-cost operation even in large-scale facilities. Since it is completed within a local network, the risk of video leakage to the outside can be reduced.

Azira has complied with the Personal Information Protection Act and related guidelines and has formulated a basic policy regarding the acquisition, use and storage of data. In principle, information obtained through AI Security Asilla is only images with posture and facial information removed, and does not include information that can identify a specific individual.

Azilla plans to further updates to AI Security asilla, and will continue to improve its technology and expand its services.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,Apple introduces RCS encryption - Strengthen privacy protection for text messages,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230555/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 08:15:00 GMT","In 2024, Apple announced support for Rich Communication Services (RCS). This allows for rich text messages to be exchanged with Android. However, these messages were not encrypted and there was a security risk. However, this problem is expected to be resolved soon.

Apple said that it will support end-to-end encryption of RCS messages with its upcoming iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS updates. This means that rich text messages exchanged between Apple and Android users are automatically protected by the latest industry standards.

End-to-end encryption for RCS

On March 14th, the industry group GSM Association (GSMA) announced a new RCS specification that includes end-to-end encryption. With the new standard, RCS will become the first major messaging format to support encryption between different providers such as Apple and Google.

The latest standard uses the ""Messaging Layer Security"" (MLS) protocol. This ensures confidentiality and security of RCS messages and their rich content when exchanged between devices. According to GSMA, by adding security features such as SIM-based authentication, end-to-end encryption helps maintain the privacy of RCS messages and protects against threats such as fraud and fraud.

Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer said in a statement cited in media such as The Verge: ""End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since its inception. We are pleased to support the industry-wide efforts to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile, which was released by GSMA."" ""In future software updates, we plan to add support for end-to-end encryption to iOS, iPadOS, macOS and watchOS.""

How dangerous is unencrypted text messages?

In December 2024, the Federal Investigation Agency (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommended that mobile users use messaging apps that have encryption enabled by default. This is due to cyberattacks from telecommunications companies such as AT&T, Verizon and Lumen Technologies.

The new end-to-end encryption is one of the features included in the large release of GSMA's RCS Universal Profile 3.0, and has been enhanced in addition to encryption. Specifically, it includes improved support for audio messaging, simplified subscription management, expanded spam detection, improved chatbot use, and more.

iMessage, Apple's standard messaging service, has long been able to encrypt text messages. However, this is only valid for Apple users using iMessage. On the other hand, Google's messaging app also has the ability to encrypt text as standard, but this is also effective only among Android users.

RCS is an alternative messaging standard for ""Short Message Service"" (SMS). Features such as attachment of larger files, high-resolution photos and videos, audio messages, read notifications, input indicators, a wide variety of emojis, and group chat can be used between iPhone and Android devices.",zdnet

https://zdnet.com,"""Google Assistant"" will end on smartphones within the end of the year -- after that, it will be ""Gemini""",https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230557/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 09:29:00 GMT","Google's AI assistant, Google Assistant, will officially replace Gemini on most smartphones by the end of 2025. Google announced the change on March 14th, US time, and said it will also be switching to Gemini tablets, headphones, and smartwatches equipped with Google Assistant.

Currently, many Android smartphones offer the option of Gemini and Google Assistant, which has been installed since 2016. After the migration, Google's senior director of Gemini apps will no longer be able to download Google Assistant from the app store.

""We will upgrade our mobile device Google Assistant to Gemini over the next few months. By the end of the year, traditional Google Assistant will no longer be available on most mobile devices, and new downloads will no longer be possible from the mobile app store,"" he explained.

According to the announcement, devices that do not meet the requirements for using the Gemini mobile app, specifically devices that have Androids that are older than Android 9, or devices with less than 2GB of memory, will not be eligible for this transition.

Google said it will also bring ""new experiences"" with Gemini to smart home devices such as smart speakers, displays and televisions. Details will be announced in the coming months, and up until then, Google Assistant will continue to be available on these devices.

This transition isn't surprising, and Google has put Gemini at the heart of many of the company's announcements. This can be seen from the multiple new demos that were shown at Mobile World Congress in early March, as well as the focused treatment at Google I/O in 2024.

Google Assistant has been a central figure for many of the company's devices for nearly a decade. After it was introduced in the short-lived messaging app ""Google Allo,"" it was installed as a default on Android smartphones and also offered as a mobile app for iOS. Starting with Google Home in 2016, it has become a feature of various smart home speakers. Google clearly states that these devices and services except Allo will continue to work, but the main way to use them will be Gemini.

The security researcher Yohane's Nugroho has developed a decryption tool with which files can be deciphered that were encrypted with the ransomware Akira. However, the tool that is available free of charge on GitHub is currently only working with the Linux version of the blackmail software.

As Bleeping Computer reports, the researcher dealt with a decryptor tool for Akira after a friend asked him for help. The development of such a tool seemed possible that the AKIRA creates the encryption key using a timeline.

Akria uses the timeline as a seed to create a strong, unpredictable encryption key. The encryption key, in turn, is individually created for each file from four different time stamps with the accuracy of a nanosecond. This already results in one billion options per second.

In addition, according to NUGroHO, Akira encrypted several files at the same time by multithreading, which designs the determination of the correct time stamp even more complex. Nevertheless, the decryption tool relies on Brute Force to generate the necessary keys.

The researchers' time stamps may be used by evaluating log files from the system of his friend by evaluating log files. The metadata allowed him to appreciate the times when the encryption was carried out. When it comes to estimate, his tool even takes into account different hardware profiles and encryption benchmarks.

He finally tested how his tool works with the Cloud GPU service from Rundpod & Vast.ai. Specifically, sixteen Nvidia GPUs of the RTX 4090 Nvidia GPUs were used to uncover a decryption key within ten hours. Depending on the number of encrypted files, the entire process may need several days. According to Bleeping Computer, Nugroho hopes that GPU experts are able to optimize its code and thus improve performance.",zdnet
https://zdnet.com,Women in the IT - further failed in many places,https://www.zdnet.de/88420875/88420875/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 04:50:01 GMT","When it comes to the general proportion of women among the employees of German companies, less than half are female in 64 percent of companies. Another 19 percent have about the same shares of women and men in the workforce. Another 15 percent more women than men. These are the results of a study by the Digital Association Bitkom, for which more than 600 companies of all industries were interviewed.

But it comes even thicker. According to the survey, no more women than men employs more women in IT and digital professions within the companies, for example in IT administration or software development, but also in departments for digital transformation or artificial intelligence. On the contrary: With 94 percent, less than half of the IT and digital areas are female in almost all German companies. In a further 4 percent, the gender share in these professions is about the same.

Recruiting

The economy would definitely like more women in these areas: a total of 37 percent of the companies surveyed have set internal goals in order to increase the proportion of women in particular in IT and digital professions. 2 percent of such goals have already achieved, another 5 percent have defined specific goals with a schedule and 30 percent have set the corresponding goals in general. Another 9 percent of the respondents are currently planning internal goals for more women in IT and digital professions, another 13 percent discuss it.

On the other hand, such goals for 38 percent of companies are not an issue. As reasons to have not yet anchored any goals, most of these companies state that they do not have enough qualified applicants (68 percent) or other priorities (61 percent).

‚ÄúWomen bring new perspectives and other experiences in companies. This diversity not only strengthens technological innovation and competitiveness. Winning more women for IT and digital professions is also a question of participation and equal participation in digitization, ‚Äùsaid Bitkom managing director Bernhard Rohleder.

In order to gain more women especially for IT and digital professions, a majority of 60 percent of companies use targeted recruiting measures, the survey continued. Cooperations with universities and schools that already maintain 24 percent of companies are most widespread to win women for IT and digital professions. 19 percent offer special entry -level programs such as traineeships. 16 percent are active on women-specific career events or trade fairs, 15 percent use advertising or social media campaigns tailored to women.

Hurd

The reasons why the proportion of women in the IT and digital professions is not higher from the economy of the economy and often it is also up to the companies themselves: 59 percent of the companies surveyed see hurdles when re-entry as a reason, such as a lack of further training during parental leave, 53 percent traditional role models in the company, 52 percent missing networks for women. At the same time, half (50 percent) also says that a male-shaped culture in IT and digital professions is shocking women.

For example, on the one hand, over two thirds (69 percent) of companies say that IT and digital professions have to be more attractive for women, but on the other hand, 39 percent also believe that men are more suitable for IT and digital professions. ‚ÄúAnyone who hangs up such a misconception must not be surprised about the shortage of skilled workers. Digitization and IT know no gender, ‚Äùsays Rohleder. ""Women should not be stopped by stereotypes, but should consciously use the career opportunities in these future professions.""

But also in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpolitics and women themselves, reasons for the small proportion are located. Half (50 percent) of the respondents sees an insufficient qualification of applicants as a reason, 46 percent believe that it was due to the poorer self -marketing of women. In addition, 55 percent of companies see the lack of care infrastructure a reason for the small proportion of women in IT and digital professions. 52 percent observe hurdles when it comes to transition, for example, employment agencies would less often recommend an IT-specific further training. Almost every second company (46 percent) accounts for clich√©d training or professional orientation in schools.
