<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/health/The-Rise-of-Postbiotics-for-Gut-Health.aspx'>The Rise of Postbiotics for Gut Health</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 08:16:00 <p>
Postbiotics' rising popularity stems from notable advantages over probiotics, including enhanced stability, safety, and longer shelf life. These advantages reduce the risks associated with live microbial consumption, such as potential pathogen transmission and antimicrobial resistance. Increasing research highlights postbiotics' beneficial mechanisms, primarily their ability to modulate protective actions against pathogens, fortify epithelial barriers, and regulate immune responses. As scientific understanding deepens, postbiotics stand poised to complement probiotics significantly, marking a transformative shift towards comprehensive, preventive healthcare strategies and innovative therapeutic applications.1 They reduce intestinal pH, creating conditions that selectively favor beneficial microbes while suppressing pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Clostridium perfringens. In addition, postbiotics modulate the immune response by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines and downregulating pro-inflammatory signals. Dietary supplementation with postbiotics has been shown to improve nutrient absorption, optimize feed efficiency, and support better overall animal growth. For example, poultry-fed diets enriched with postbiotics demonstrate increased body weight gain, improved feed conversion rates, and healthier gut morphology compared to control groups.2,3 For instance, SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, produced from microbial fermentation, are notable for their capacity to strengthen the gut barrier by enhancing the integrity of tight junction proteins, thus preventing pathogen invasion and systemic inflammation.4 Studies have shown that these metabolites can modulate inflammatory responses by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). They promote the growth of beneficial gut microbiota, directly compete with pathogenic bacteria for adhesion sites, and enhance mucosal defense mechanisms through antimicrobial peptides. Research has shown that postbiotic administration increases beneficial microbes like Bifidobacteria while decreasing harmful pathogens such as Escherichia coli.4 Emerging evidence also suggests postbiotics can aid metabolic regulation, demonstrating potential anti-obesity and glucose homeostasis effects. Their stability, safety profile, and efficacy make them an attractive alternative or complement to probiotics, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics are integral elements in gut microbiome management, each playing a unique yet interconnected role. Postbiotics, the latest addition to microbiome-focused interventions, represent non-living microbial cells or bioactive substances produced by probiotics during fermentation. They offer benefits like modulating immune responses, enhancing gut barrier integrity, and exerting anti-inflammatory effects without the risks associated with administering live microorganisms, especially in immunocompromised individuals.5 Integrating postbiotics into the broader microbiome conversation requires clearer regulatory frameworks and robust clinical evidence. Unlike probiotics, postbiotics withstand harsh gastrointestinal conditions, have extended shelf-life, and eliminate risks associated with live bacterial strains.5,6 Clear guidelines distinguishing postbiotics from probiotics remain underdeveloped, complicating product standardization, labeling, and market authorization.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/health/The-Role-of-Fiber-in-Preventing-Chronic-Disease.aspx'>The Role of Fiber in Preventing Chronic Disease</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 05:33:00 <p>
This deficiency has significant public health implications, as low fiber consumption is linked to increased risks of metabolic disorders, gastrointestinal diseases, kidney disease, cancer, and cardiovascular conditions.2–4 Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which fiber exerts its protective effects is essential for developing dietary guidelines and intervention strategies to reduce the burden of chronic disease. Additionally, cultural and socioeconomic factors also influence fiber consumption, highlighting the need for targeted dietary interventions and public health policies to bridge the gap in fiber intake across populations. Fiber exerts its health benefits through multiple physiological mechanisms, such as gastrointestinal function, metabolic regulation, and modulation of inflammation. The fermentation of dietary fiber by gut microbiota also produces metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which strengthen the gut barrier and reduce systemic inflammation.2,6 Dietary fiber also modulates gut hormone secretion, influencing appetite regulation and energy balance, which are critical for long-term metabolic health.2 These fatty acids regulate immune function, modulating cytokine production and reducing markers of systemic inflammation.5 This process plays a crucial role in preventing chronic inflammatory conditions, including autoimmune diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Mayo Clinic Minute: How dietary fiber makes you healthier Play Numerous meta-analyses have established that fiber intake is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Whole grains, in particular, contain high levels of beta-glucans, which have been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve endothelial function. High-fiber diets are also associated with improved arterial elasticity, which contributes to better circulation and reduced cardiovascular strain.7 Fiber intake has also been associated with lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a key marker of systemic inflammation that plays a role in cardiovascular disease progression.5 Epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with the highest fiber intake have a 20–30% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes.4,6 Cereal fibers, in particular, have shown significant protective effects.5 Additionally, soluble fiber slows carbohydrate absorption, reducing postprandial glucose spikes. Fiber also promotes a more diverse gut microbiota, which has been linked to improved metabolic health.8 High-fiber diets reduce systemic inflammation, a major factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, fiber enhances the production of gut-derived hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which plays a role in glucose metabolism and appetite regulation.4,5 Fiber enhances stool bulk and reduces gut transit time, minimizing exposure of colonic cells to carcinogens. Additionally, the fermentation of fiber generates SCFAs, which support colonic health and exhibit anti-cancer properties.1,7 Certain types of fiber, such as resistant starch, have been shown to increase the production of butyrate, which has protective effects on colonic epithelial cells and may prevent tumor formation.2 Furthermore, fiber intake is associated with a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to cancer progression.1 Research suggests that optimal fiber intake is best achieved through whole foods rather than supplements. Current dietary guidelines recommend fiber intakes of 25 g per day for women and 38g per day for men, yet most individuals consume significantly less.2 However, increasing fiber intake requires dietary changes, such as replacing refined grains with whole grains, consuming more plant-based foods, and choosing fiber-rich snacks. Additionally, dietary education programs can help individuals better understand fiber sources and implement gradual changes to improve long-term adherence. Unfortunately, modern food processing significantly reduces fiber content in many staple foods. Implementing policies that promote whole grain consumption and educate consumers about fiber-rich diets can help counteract these effects. Furthermore, reformulating processed foods to include functional fiber additives, such as inulin and resistant starch, could be an additional strategy to improve fiber intake in modern diets. Dietary fiber is a key factor in preventing chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer. However, despite the clear health benefits, fiber intake remains insufficient in many populations. Given its numerous health benefits, policymakers and healthcare professionals should advocate for fiber-rich diets as part of chronic disease prevention strategies.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250317/Researchers-discover-MAFB-and-CEBPAe28099s-role-in-hypospadias-pathogenesis.aspx'>Researchers discover MAFB and CEBPA’s role in hypospadias pathogenesis</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 00:00:00 <p>
Hypospadias is characterized by an ectopic urethral opening and abnormal penile curvature, affecting approximately 1 in 200 live male births. While its origins are believed to stem from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, androgen signaling pathways are thought to play a significant role in the condition's development. Previous studies have suggested that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in urethral development, but the specific contributions of transcription factors such as MAFB and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) have yet to be fully explored. On September 13, 2024, a study (DOI: 10.1016/j.gendis.2024.101432) published in Genes & Diseases and led by researchers from the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University in China identified MAFB and CEBPA as crucial regulators of urothelial cell growth. Furthermore, MAFB overexpression promoted cell proliferation and activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, while CEBPA knockdown reversed these effects. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the MAFB-CEBPA axis in regulating urothelial cell growth and suggest that disruptions in this pathway may contribute to hypospadias development. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying hypospadias. By identifying the roles of MAFB and CEBPA in urothelial growth, we have uncovered potential targets for therapeutic intervention, which could lead to improved outcomes for patients with this condition." By targeting this pathway, researchers could develop novel therapies to correct or prevent the malformation during early development. Future research may focus on identifying additional genetic factors and environmental influences that interact with the MAFB-CEBPA pathway, further advancing our understanding of hypospadias and related conditions.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250317/Understanding-how-JAK-inhibitors-may-increase-blood-clot-risk.aspx'>Understanding how JAK inhibitors may increase blood clot risk</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 00:00:00 <p>
Why do medications that are supposed to help patients with chronic inflammatory diseases sometimes lead to blood clots? This is one of the questions that a team of researchers from Aarhus University has sought to answer in a study that has just been published in the journal Inflammopharmacology. This helps improve our understanding of why we see an increased risk of blood clots when using JAK inhibitors," explains Stine Rabech Haysen, former medical student at the Department of Biomedicine at Aarhus University, who is the first author of the publication. In the study, researchers used publicly available data from a number of published studies about patients with blood clots and compared them with a healthy control group. They found no direct genetic explanation, but they did find a statistically significant enrichment of genes that are subject to regulatory control of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway among genes whose expression is altered in patients with blood clots. "Although we cannot draw definitive conclusions about the mechanistic link between the use of JAK inhibitors and the risk of blood clots, our study demonstrates the potential of using data mining to identify and shed light on possible mechanisms of drug side effects," says one of the study's senior authors, associate professor at the Department of Biomedicine Per Qvist. Although JAK inhibitors rarely lead to blood clots, it's important to understand the mechanism behind them so that the risk can be reduced. "For the average person, our study means that we're getting closer to understanding why some drugs can have dangerous side effects like blood clots. And going forward, our method could help identify and prevent serious side effects, potentially making drug treatment safer," explains the other senior author of the study, associate professor at the Department of Biomedicine Tue Wenzel Kragstrup. The researchers will now test the method on other types of medication to see if it can be used to detect side effects more widely.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

For example, how do adults – from parents to researchers – fully comprehend what is perceived as stressful by an infant or child? Such conceptual queries, as well as the use of cutting-edge research tools, can provide a road map, guiding experts toward developing innovative methods and providing solutions to this pressing mental health issue. Our review has important implications for how we approach early intervention and prevention strategies." She and co-author Matthew Birnie, a UC Irvine postdoctoral scholar, identify several key areas for further investigation: One notable discovery is a novel form of early-life stress: unpredictable sensory inputs from caregivers and the environment. Animal models have been instrumental in unraveling the mechanisms underlying brain development effects. Research has revealed that different types of stress can yield distinct outcomes, influenced by the nature and timing of stress, as well as species, strain and sex variations. At the molecular level, early-life stress can substantially alter neuronal gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. "We're gradually comprehending how early-life stress can 'reprogram' the brain at multiple levels, from individual molecules to entire neural circuits. The review also identifies key molecular mediators of early-life stress effects, including glucocorticoids and neuropeptides like corticotropin-releasing hormones. Ongoing research is uncovering novel roles for these molecules in specific neural circuits affected by early stress. In light of these findings, the researchers propose redefining early-life stress as "early-life adversity" to better encompass the diverse experiences that can impact brain development, even those not traditionally perceived as stressful. "This review emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of early-life adversity," Baram said. The researchers suggest increased funding for and attention to this critical area of study, highlighting its potential to enhance mental health outcomes and reduce the societal burden of early-life adversity. Baram is also the Danette Shepard Chair in Neurological Studies and director of UC Irvine's Conte Center, which is supported by a Silvio O.

Microglia, the brain's immune cells, usually serve as diligent guardians. They eliminate intruders such as microbes and clear away cellular debris – including the plaques typical of Alzheimer's disease. While some continue to function effectively, others gradually lose their protective role and start secreting small amounts of inflammatory messengers. Through meticulous analyses, research teams led by Professor Frank Heppner, Director of the Department of Neuropathology at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and Professor Nikolaus Rajewsky, Director of the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology at the Max Delbrück Center (MDC-BIMSB), along with additional partners, have identified how IL-12 might trigger and accelerate Alzheimer's dementia. Their study, published in "Nature Aging," could pave the way for new combination therapies. For decades, Alzheimer's research focused almost exclusively on amyloid-beta and tau deposits, while inflammation was considered a side effect. Only recently have we begun to recognize that inflammatory processes may be a primary driver of disease progression." "But we couldn't unravel the underlying mechanism with standard techniques," Heppner explains. Researchers use single-cell analyses to observe this process, reconstructing which genes are being read and translated into proteins in thousands of individual cells simultaneously. These analyses generate massive datasets, which can now be analyzed with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning. However, a major challenge in using single cell sequencing technology is isolating individual cells from a tissue sample without damaging them or causing unintended changes. "In aging mouse brains – especially those with Alzheimer's plaques – cells are so stuck together and tangled that separating them cleanly is nearly impossible," Rajewsky explains. By cross-referencing with publicly available data, such as the Allen Brain Atlas, they can ensure that their method provides a representative snapshot of all cell populations. "This painstaking early optimization was crucial – without it, we would not have been able to detect these connections." IL-12, previously known primarily for its role in autoimmune diseases like Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, appears to play a pivotal role in Alzheimer's progression. It damages two key brain cell types: mature oligodendrocytes, which normally produce myelin ­– the fatty insulating layer around nerve fibers essential for rapid signal transmission; and interneurons, which are particularly important for cognition and memory. When Heppner's team blocked IL-12 in cell cultures and mouse models, they could stem disease-related changes. Electron micrographs of mouse brain tissue taken at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Göttingen also showed how myelin structure and nerve fiber density changed depending on whether the IL-12 signaling pathway was present or absent. Cell cultures with human oligodendrocytes were also extremely sensitive to IL-12. The only remaining question is which cell type IL-12 impacts first – oligodendrocytes, interneurons, or both simultaneously," says Heppner, who is also Group Leader in Neuroimmunology at the Deutschen Zentrums für Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE). The researchers hope that clinicians will build on their findings and initiate clinical trials. "If these drugs prove effective, they would be a new arrow in the quiver. "Microglia may struggle to process microplastic, triggering inflammatory reactions," Rajewsky suggests. "This could reveal a link between environmental factors and widespread diseases." While unproven, both teams consider it a compelling and important research direction.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Despite widespread vaccination and antiviral treatments, millions of people still suffer from chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Current therapies, such as nucleos(t)ide analogues and interferons, fail to eliminate cccDNA, allowing the virus to rebound after treatment is stopped. These challenges underscore the need for novel therapeutic strategies that specifically target cccDNA to achieve a functional cure. By focusing on chromatin-modifying enzymes, viral proteins, and noncoding RNAs, the researchers hope to uncover new pathways for a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B. Key epigenetic mechanisms—such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the involvement of noncoding RNAs—regulate cccDNA activity. For example, DNA methylation suppresses viral transcription, while histone modifications like acetylation and succinylation can either activate or silence cccDNA transcription, providing potential targets for intervention. HBx interacts with host factors to alter the epigenetic landscape of cccDNA, promoting an open chromatin state that facilitates viral gene expression. The study also explores emerging therapeutic strategies, including targeting HBx, utilizing epigenetic modifiers, and employing gene-editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt cccDNA. Our findings underscore the critical role of epigenetic mechanisms in HBV pathogenesis. By targeting these pathways, we can develop therapies that not only suppress viral replication but also offer a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B." Epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, could be repurposed or newly designed to specifically target cccDNA. By combining these strategies with current antiviral treatments, researchers could significantly enhance their effectiveness, bringing us closer to a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://news-medical.net/news/20250317/New-research-reveals-potential-path-forward-for-glioblastoma-treatment.aspx'>New research reveals potential path forward for glioblastoma treatment</a></h2><b>Source:</b> news-medical&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 00:00:00 <p>
With a strongly immunosuppressive microenvironment, highly variable presentations between patients, and physically challenging surgical conditions, glioblastoma remains exceptionally difficult to treat. Brain tumors are one of the most formidable foes in medicine. Ashish H. Shah, M.D., senior author of the study, neurosurgeon and researcher at Sylvester Immune checkpoint inhibition has been successfully used to treat more than a dozen diverse cancers, but because brain cancers are in such a strongly immune-suppressive environment, the treatment has largely failed in the case-by-case attempts to date. "For many other cancers, immunotherapies have completely changed the field, but for brain tumors, we haven't seen that same improvement," Shah said. Learning what could make immune checkpoint therapies more effective - or effective at all - for glioblastoma patients is critical for understanding how to treat patients best. According to Shah's new study, viral mimicry may be the answer. Viral mimicry, a tool at the leading edge of cancer treatment, may be the key path forward in making immune checkpoint inhibition effective for treating glioblastoma. These ancient fragments are not strong enough to cause a real viral infection, but they still trigger an anti-viral immune response. That antiviral response can make tumors more susceptible to immunotherapies. But it had not been successfully applied to brain tumors until Shah's new work. By suppressing ZNF638 in the tumor, they might create a viral mimicry response, opening the doors to immune checkpoint inhibitors effectively treating glioblastoma at last. The researchers first searched cancer databases, documenting associations between ZNF638 and immune-related factors such as immune cell infiltration. They analyzed glioblastoma patients' genetic data and found that patients who were more responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy naturally had lower expressions of ZNF638 and higher survival rates. Cell-based experiments and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that tumors with low ZNF638 tended to have more immune cell infiltration, and the monitoring system for retroviruses was active. It was possible that targeting ZNF638 could create "viral mimicry" conditions in tumors. Combining ZNF638 targeting with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy improved the treatment's efficacy: ZNF638 suppression had decreased tumor growth, increased T-cell lymphocyte infiltration and improved survival times. "The most surprising findings were in the clinical data, where patients with low ZNF638 expression had improved responses to immunotherapy," said Jay Chandar, a fourth-year medical student in Shah's lab and study co-author. "With previous trials using ICI to treat glioblastoma having largely failed, it's exciting to find a novel therapeutic target and see that viral mimicry could help," said Deepa Seetharam, Ph.D., a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Neurosurgery and study co-author. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are not currently approved for treating glioblastoma, so previous patients have been on a case-by-case basis, Shah said. Using ZNF638 as a biomarker could help change that by predicting which patients would likely be responsive to ICI therapy. "A synergistic treatment like that is the future of immunotherapy in treating glioblastoma."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A new analysis led by surgeons at UCLA Health finds that psychological prehabilitation can significantly enhance recovery after surgery. The research, led by Anne E. Hall in the lab of Dr. Justine Lee analyzed data from 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted between 2004 and 2024, involving a total of 2,376 patients. Prehabilitation is a proactive approach aimed at improving surgical outcomes through preventive measures. Traditionally, it has focused on physical function and patient education. However, mental health has recently gained attention due to its crucial role in postoperative recovery, including reducing persistent opioid use. Study methods The researchers conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of RCTs retrieved from databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar. They included studies with more than 50 adult surgical patients and evaluated the effects of different preoperative psychotherapy-based interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), supportive psychotherapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), on postoperative outcomes. Key findings The study found that psychological prehabilitation significantly reduces the length of hospital stay, pain, anxiety, and depression after surgery. A decrease in pain by an average of 3.52 points; This approach may also help reduce healthcare costs associated with prolonged hospital stays and postoperative complications.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
