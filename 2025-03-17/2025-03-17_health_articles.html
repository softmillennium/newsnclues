IAM Healthcare Bargaining Committee Member Kelly Williams read a powerful message from her coworkers in the executive office of The Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center. Her statement listed the reasons safe staffing levels are critical to patient care at OSU hospitals and called for OSU executives to recruit and retain more front-line healthcare staff.

Williams' courage was reinforced by the fact that OSU Chief Operating Officer Jay Anderson's office was packed full of her coworkers. The petitions they delivered were from more than 1,200 front-line healthcare workers and Columbus community members supporting these IAM Healthcare members.                                                                       

“We routinely hear stories of patient care units that should be staffed with one Patient Care Associate for four, five, or six patients,” said Williams. “But instead they are expected to care for 10, 11, 12 or more patients at once.” 

The Medical Center has acknowledged a first-year turnover rate of more than 50% among the highly skilled Patient Care Associates (PCAs) and Psychiatric Care Technicians (PCTs). 

“It's clear when we're given the bare minimum of PCTs that staffing is done reactively and not proactively.” said Dylan England-Carroll, a Senior PCT who also read a statement on behalf of their coworkers. “Our patients are going through the toughest days of their lives. They deserve better from the hospital, but OSU executives are giving them the bare minimum number of support staff and stretching us thin.”

The day after the action, OSU Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) Deana Sievert attended negotiations to respond to IAM Healthcare members' critical staffing and ratio concerns. Bargaining committee members asked questions and delivered powerful testimonies on the daily challenges faced by patients, PCAs and PCTs. IAM Healthcare Bargaining Committee Members expressed appreciation for CNO Sievert's respectful engagement, but said it was clear that she and other executives lack a concrete plan to address the understaffing crisis. 

In response to the continued failures of OSU executives, PCA and PCT workplace leaders have called for an informational picketing action at the Medical Center on Tuesday, March 19, 2025. 

With the only remaining scheduled meeting date between the parties and a federal mediator approaching, the workplace leaders say they and their colleagues are prepared to take further action if OSU executives do not make movement on safe staffing, recruitment, and retention.

IAM Healthcare is a rapidly growing department within the powerhouse IAM Union, which has more than 600,000 current and retired members across the U.S. and Canada. International Union leaders backed their membership's readiness for further action.

“We will bring the full resources of our international union to bear in support of these courageous IAM Healthcare professionals and their struggle to protect their patients,” said IAM Union International President Brian Bryant. “The OSU executives still have time to do the right thing by investing in safe staffing, recruitment, and retention of front-line staff.”

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, enabling machines to understand and generate human-like text with remarkable accuracy. However, despite their impressive language capabilities, LLMs are inherently limited by the data they were trained on. Their knowledge is static and confined to the information they were trained on, which becomes problematic when dealing with dynamic and constantly evolving domains like healthcare.

The healthcare industry is a complex, ever-changing landscape with a vast and rapidly growing body of knowledge. Medical research, clinical practices, and treatment guidelines are constantly being updated, rendering even the most advanced LLMs quickly outdated. Additionally, patient data, including electronic health records (EHRs), diagnostic reports, and medical histories, are highly personalized and unique to each individual. Relying solely on an LLM's pre-trained knowledge is insufficient for providing accurate and personalized healthcare recommendations.

Furthermore, healthcare decisions often require integrating information from multiple sources, such as medical literature, clinical databases, and patient records. LLMs lack the ability to seamlessly access and synthesize data from these diverse and distributed sources. This limits their potential to provide comprehensive and well-informed insights for healthcare applications.

Overcoming these challenges is crucial for using the full potential of LLMs in the healthcare domain. Patients, healthcare providers, and researchers require intelligent agents that can provide up-to-date, personalized, and context-aware support, drawing from the latest medical knowledge and individual patient data.

Enter LLM function calling, a powerful capability that addresses these challenges by allowing LLMs to interact with external functions or APIs, enabling them to access and use additional data sources or computational capabilities beyond their pre-trained knowledge. By combining the language understanding and generation abilities of LLMs with external data sources and services, LLM function calling opens up a world of possibilities for intelligent healthcare agents.

In this blog post, we will explore how Mistral LLM on Amazon Bedrock can address these challenges and enable the development of intelligent healthcare agents with LLM function calling capabilities, while maintaining robust data security and privacy through Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.

Healthcare agents equipped with LLM function calling can serve as intelligent assistants for various stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and researchers. They can assist patients by answering medical questions, interpreting test results, and providing personalized health advice based on their medical history and current conditions. For healthcare providers, these agents can help with tasks such as summarizing patient records, suggesting potential diagnoses or treatment plans, and staying up to date with the latest medical research. Additionally, researchers can use LLM function calling to analyze vast amounts of scientific literature, identify patterns and insights, and accelerate discoveries in areas such as drug development or disease prevention.

LLM function calling offers several advantages for enterprise applications, including enhanced decision-making, improved efficiency, personalized experiences, and scalability. By combining the language understanding capabilities of LLMs with external data sources and computational resources, enterprises can make more informed and data-driven decisions, automate and streamline various tasks, provide tailored recommendations and experiences for individual users or customers, and handle large volumes of data and process multiple requests concurrently.

Potential use cases for LLM function calling in the healthcare domain include patient triage, medical question answering, and personalized treatment recommendations. LLM-powered agents can assist in triaging patients by analyzing their symptoms, medical history, and risk factors, and providing initial assessments or recommendations for seeking appropriate care. Patients and healthcare providers can receive accurate and up-to-date answers to medical questions by using LLMs' ability to understand natural language queries and access relevant medical knowledge from various data sources. Additionally, by integrating with electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical decision support systems, LLM function calling can provide personalized treatment recommendations tailored to individual patients' medical histories, conditions, and preferences.

Amazon Bedrock supports a variety of foundation models. In this post, we will be exploring how to perform function calling using Mistral from Amazon Bedrock. Mistral supports function calling, which allows agents to invoke external functions or APIs from within a conversation flow. This capability enables agents to retrieve data, perform calculations, or use external services to enhance their conversational abilities. Function calling in Mistral is achieved through the use of specific function call blocks that define the external function to be invoked and handle the response or output.

LLM function calling typically involves integrating an LLM model with an external API or function that provides access to additional data sources or computational capabilities. The LLM model acts as an interface, processing natural language inputs and generating responses based on its pre-trained knowledge and the information obtained from the external functions or APIs. The architecture typically consists of the LLM model, a function or API integration layer, and external data sources and services.

Healthcare agents can integrate LLM models and call external functions or APIs through a series of steps: natural language input processing, self-correction, chain of thought, function or API calling through an integration layer, data integration and processing, and persona adoption. The agent receives natural language input, processes it through the LLM model, calls relevant external functions or APIs if additional data or computations are required, combines the LLM model's output with the external data or results, and provides a comprehensive response to the user.

High Level Architecture- Healthcare assistant

The architecture for the Healthcare Agent is shown in the preceding figure and is as follows:

A sample code using function calling through the Mistral LLM can be found at mistral-on-aws.

Data privacy and security are of utmost importance in the healthcare sector because of the sensitive nature of personal health information (PHI) and the potential consequences of data breaches or unauthorized access. Compliance with regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR is crucial for healthcare organizations handling patient data.

The six guiding principles of using AI tools in healthcare. Credit: FUTURE-AI consortium

A new set of guidelines have been launched to create trustworthy AI systems in health care. The first of its kind, the FUTURE-AI guideline provides recommendations covering the entire lifecycle of medical AI, from design, development and validation to regulation, deployment, and monitoring.

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in health care, helping with tasks like disease diagnosis and predicting treatment outcomes. However, despite these advances, many health care professionals and patients are still hesitant to fully embrace AI technologies. This hesitation largely stems from concerns about trust, safety, and ethics.

In particular, existing research has shown that AI tools in health care can be prone to errors and patient harm, biases and increased health inequalities, lack of transparency and accountability, as well as data privacy and security breaches.

To overcome these challenges the FUTURE-AI Consortium has developed a comprehensive set of guidelines published in the BMJ. Developed by an international consortium of 117 experts from 50 countries the new guidelines called FUTURE-AI provide a roadmap for creating trustworthy and responsible AI tools for health care.

The FUTURE-AI guidelines are built around six guiding principles:

Gary Collins, Professor of Medical Statistics at the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, and author of FUTURE-AI said, "These guidelines fill an important gap in the field of health care AI to give clinicians, patients, and health authorities the confidence to adopt AI tools knowing they are technically sound, clinically safe, and ethically aligned. The FUTURE-AI framework is designed to evolve over time, adapting to new technologies, challenges, and stakeholder feedback. This dynamic approach ensures the guidelines remain relevant and useful as the field of health care AI continues to rapidly advance."

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) posted a Tiktok video on Feb. 20 saying he had "breaking news" about the fate of Medicare coverage for telehealth visits, which allow patients to see health care providers remotely from their homes.

"Breaking news: The Trump administration just announced that Medicare will stop covering telehealth starting April 1," Khanna said. "We need to stand up to these Medicare cuts."

The same day, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services posted a document online titled "Telehealth" that said, "Through March 31, 2025, you can get telehealth services at any location in the U.S., including your home. Starting April 1, 2025, you must be in an office or medical facility located in a rural area (in the U.S.) for most telehealth services."

CMS did not respond to requests for comment about the post. The White House also did not respond to requests for comment.

The telehealth benefit was first put in place as a temporary Trump-era addition to Medicare coverage during the covid-19 public health emergency.

Khanna's statement took on more significance leading up to the threat of a government shutdown, but late last week Congress averted one by approving a stopgap spending bill.

The expiration date for the benefit has been known since December, when Congress extended coverage around telehealth through March 31. The roughly 90-day reprieve was part of a compromise after then-President-elect Donald Trump and his ally Elon Musk criticized a sweeping, end-of-year legislative package that would have, among other things, continued those benefits for two years.

Their opposition forced Congress to pass a stripped-down version of the end-of-year bill. Telehealth's two-year extension, included in the initial bill, became collateral damage.

Last week, just as the clock was ticking down, House Republicans passed a spending bill for the rest of the fiscal year that includes another extension of telehealth flexibilities — this one lasting through September. The Senate then cleared the bill for Trump's signature, with the support of 10 Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Regardless, the two-year extension proposed in December — or a permanent extension, as Khanna has urged — looks unlikely.

"President Trump and Elon Musk blew up the continuing resolution last December that would have extended these telehealth authorities by two years," Khanna told us via email. "Trump should work with Congress to extend telehealth coverage for Medicare beneficiaries."

It wouldn't come free. Permanently extending telehealth for medical care under Medicare could cost taxpayers about $25 billion over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. The CBO calculated five months of expanded telehealth coverage as costing $663 million, and calculated that that would total almost $25 billion through fiscal year 2031 if spending remained level, which it may not do.

Also, the agency and the Government Accountability Office have raised concerns about fraud and overuse of the benefit, among other potential issues.

Congress made Medicare coverage of behavioral health services delivered remotelypermanent in December 2020, but left other telehealth benefits hanging on by a string. Instead, lawmakers extended them for short periods during the nearly two years since the public health emergency officially ended in May 2023.

"Now, once again, we've got another deadline where, if Congress doesn't act, our flexibilities go away," said Kyle Zebley, senior vice president of public policy for the American Telemedicine Association.

And if, at some point, the telehealth benefits aren't extended, is it fair to describe the policy change as a cut? Khanna, for instance, plans to introduce the Telehealth Coverage Act, which would require Medicare to cover seniors' telehealth services.

Politically speaking, it's a powerful question when trying to leverage public support — and politicians in both parties often accuse their opponents of "cutting" federal benefits when they make changes to programs.

"Khanna is overly dramatic," said Joseph Antos, a senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

If the provision expires, Antos said, "this is not a Trump cut."

But beneficiaries might have a different experience. Since the early days of the pandemic — five years now — millions of patients have come to rely on telehealth for their medical services. That benefit, even with another temporary reprieve, would still be at risk.

According to CMS, more than 1 in 10 Medicare beneficiaries used virtual care services as of 2023. And, after the Trump administration green-lighted telehealth for Medicare recipients in 2020, many private insurers did the same.

Overall telehealth claims in Medicare rose from fewer than 1% of all claims before the covid pandemic to a peak of 13% in April 2020. Now they stand at close to 5%, according to Fair Health, a nonprofit that tracks health care costs.

Those in the telehealth industry are optimistic about the current extension. The Trump administration, they say, has been sending encouraging signals — even highlighting its previous support of telemedicine in its fact sheet on the launch of the President's Make America Healthy Again Commission.

"We've been sweating bullets," Zebley said. "But it's been nerve-wracking before. I think we're going to get it done."

Antos said, however, that after the extension in the House-passed spending bill, Medicare's telemedicine benefits could be dead.

Khanna said, "Breaking news: The Trump administration just announced that Medicare will stop covering telehealth starting April 1. … We need to stand up to these Medicare cuts."

The statement is partially accurate, because the Trump administration announced the March 31 sunset of Medicare telehealth visits, and some beneficiaries who were using that benefit could see it as a "cut." But the claim lacks key context that the expiration date was set by Congress, not the Trump administration.

After Khanna's claim, Congress extended access to telehealth coverage through September.

Based on information that was available at the time, we rate Khanna's statement Half True.

NEW YORK, March 17, 2025

President Abdallah announces Trustee Debbane's largest gift in LAU's history for LAU Global.

NEW YORK, March 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of its commitment to support education and healthcare in Lebanon, the Lebanese American University (LAU) marked the beginning of a new century of service to the community in a Centennial Gala Dinner held on March 13, 2025, at the New York Public Library.



 



Proceeds from the fundraiser will go toward LAU's initiatives to foster industry in Lebanon, support financially challenged students and patients, and create an ever-giving legacy.

The university's continued efforts to help uplift the country are needed more than ever as Lebanon emerges from years of crises and embarks on rebuilding and renewal.

The event was attended by New York State Assemblymember Alex Bores, Lebanon's Ambassador to the United Nations Hadi Hachem, Permanent Representative of the State of Kuwait to the United Nations Ambassador Tareq Al-Bannai, Consul General of Lebanon in New York Majdi Ramadan, members of the Board of Trustees, LAU President Emeritus Joseph G. Jabbra, alumni, donors, and friends of LAU committed to upholding LAU's mission.

Welcoming the distinguished guests, the Chairman of the LAU Board of Trustees Philip Stoltzfus said: "The Lebanese American University is a trusted institution for a simple reason: we always try to do the right thing, decade after decade, in times of crisis, in times of blessings. For a full century, for 100 years. It is not always easy and it is nearly always expensive, but acting this way is not a choice, it resides in our mission, the formative values of our founders, our sacred covenant with Lebanon."

LAU President Chaouki T. Abdallah announced that LAU trustee Raymond Debbane and family were making the greatest gift in LAU's history to launch the university's global strategy and support its New York campus.

Expressing his gratitude to sponsors, donors and friends of LAU for their generosity and commitment to the university's mission, he said: "Please join me in holding the gate of hope open for more students in Lebanon and around the world and thank you for helping us usher in the second century of LAU."

Alumnus and CEO of Synopsys, Sassine Ghazi ('91) and three-time World Music Award winner and Arab pop icon Elissa were honored at the event; Ghazi for his lifetime achievements in innovation and excellence and Elissa for her advocacy of women's rights and brave fight against breast cancer.

Ghazi said: "When I went to LAU in '88 I never imagined I would be here at its 100 anniversary. I love our country, and I love our heritage and our people."

"Today, more than ever, our nation needs passionate leaders with access to education," said Elissa. "It is our collective duty to nurture this hope and empower future generations to believe in themselves and dream so they can best represent Lebanon anywhere like yourselves."

The evening was co-chaired by LAU trustees, H.H. Sheikha Intisar Al Sabah and Mr. Peter Tanous.

The Digital Medicine Society (DiMe) and Google Health launched a free online course for medical professionals, researchers, administrators and innovators to learn the fundamentals of generative AI, large language models (LLMs) and the technologies' use cases in healthcare.

The Generative AI for Healthcare course gives stakeholders an understanding of LLMs and their applications in healthcare. Participants will also gain insights into generative AI technology, develop prompt engineering skills and explore how AI can support decision-making in clinical settings.

The course, available to the DiMe community, combines videos, quizzes and hands-on labs. Participants must take a survey before gaining access to the course, and the self-paced course and lab are timed for one hour each. 

THE LARGER TREND

Exploring the use of AI within healthcare began in the 1960s and has expanded substantially within the sector, with the technology currently used within precision medicine, drug discovery and development, and robotic surgery.   

Although many researchers and experts have deemed the technology promising, it is crucial to address the ethical and societal considerations accompanying AI technology integration. 

Healthcare providers must consider proper use cases of the technology in the healthcare setting and have a complete understanding of the tech because, as Harjinder Sandhu, Microsoft's CTO of health platforms and solutions, told HIMSS TV, there are high-value and low-risk use cases and vice versa. 

"One of the things that AI systems can do is summarize patients in various contexts depending on who is asking the question and for what purpose," Sandhu said.

"The problem with that is that if the AI system hallucinates information, it makes up information about that patient or it omits important information that can lead to catastrophic consequences for that patient. That's an example of a really high-value but also high-risk use case," he added.

Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins joins 'Fox & Friends' to praise President Donald Trump's 'generational change' and questions whether the government has utilized resources 'wisely.'

Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Doug Collins clapped back at critics he accused of circulating "fake news" about the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts inordinately affecting veterans' care.

Collins, who remains an active colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserves, announced his agency is opening what will be a fourth new VA clinic in the few months he has been in office.

"As government union bosses, the legacy media and some in Congress have been spreading false rumors of health care and benefits cuts at VA, we've opened multiple brand-new clinics that will serve tens of thousands of veterans," Collins said in a statement.

"Don't believe the fake news."

VA SEC ACCUSES REPORTER OF SPREADING RUMORS ABOUT DOGE HURTING VETERANS

On Friday, the VA opened a new clinic in Hamilton, Montana, marking the fourth such ribbon-cutting since President Donald Trump took office just under two months ago.

Previously, Collins oversaw the establishment of a new clinic in fast-growing Spotsylvania, Virginia, – between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia, – as well as in Aurora, Colorado, and Ridgewood, Queens, in New York City.

A Montana VA official told Montana Public Radio last week that Collins had been clear that there would be "no cuts" to services despite DOGE attempting to take an ax to the bureaucracy – and with it many VA employees.

The 8,000-square-foot facility is 600% larger than a prior, now-defunct clinic in the area.

Meanwhile, the new Spotsylvania facility is primed to be the largest of its kind in the country, according to Fredericksburg-area media. 

FORT BRAGG IS BACK

An estimated 35,000 patients can be seen each year at the new site, located where Interstate 95 and US-1 diverge just south of the city.

While the VA is primed to cut 15% of its workforce via DOGE's efforts – from 471,000 to 398,000 – Collins reiterated to Fox News that there will be no interruption or decline in services or care quality.

Collins responded to a warning from Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who said that such cuts would hurt service to veterans and that the thought it is a "bad idea" should be a "bipartisan" admonition.

Citing the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the secretary said all parties should at least agree that the VA has seen its services at "high risk" for waste, fraud, abuse and insufficient care.

"I've been here four weeks, but it's interesting that there's no solutions being proposed," Collins told "Fox & Friends" last week.

"President Trump brought generational change to DC. And he's saying let's look at everything. So what we're looking at is, if our system is on a high risk list, if we've had issues and all that the government has decided to do lately has put money or people at something, then maybe we need to ask the better question -- are we using our resources wisely and making sure that our department is taking care of the veteran, which is our only responsibility?"

Other liberals have lambasted the administration over proposed cuts to VA staff, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., ranking member of the Senate Health Committee.

"They're going to gut the Department of Veterans Affairs, jeopardizing the health and well-being of millions of veterans," Sanders recently claimed.

One Democratic veteran in Congress, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, said he regularly visits the VA on a personal level and sees waiting lists and knows how troublesome the process can be.

"All of that is going to get worse," Moulton told MSNBC.

Collins said Trump set a goal for reduction-in-force, and that Democrats do not understand that the projected staff figures are part of a "deliberative process that's going to take some time."

"That's going to include career VA employees. It's going to include senior executives," he said.

Collins said the GAO has had the VA on its high-risk list for a decade, but only now are Democrats in Congress "yelling ‘don't do anything.'"

Of the layoffs thus far, Collins said the proportion has been less than 1% of the agency's workforce and has not really affected front-facing personnel.

He also said that $980 million in contract-related spending is being scrutinized in an attempt to instead reinvest it in patient care, as part of DOGE's work.

Additionally, on Monday, the VA announced it is phasing-out treatment for "gender dysphoria" – which had been supported by the Biden administration.

"Effective immediately, VA will not offer cross-sex hormone therapy to veterans who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria, unless" they are in the midst of receiving such care, the agency said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.

WM sees future healthcare trends, such as the growth of at-home healthcare, as a future business opportunity as it works to integrate Stericycle's medical waste assets.

Four months into WM's acquisition of Stericycle, the company has focused on ramping up facilities, completing divestitures and tracking key medical waste trends to market itself as a “comprehensive” option for medical waste collection, transportation and treatment.

WM is in the process of integrating Stericycle's medical waste and secure information destruction businesses into a segment now known as WM Healthcare Solutions. When WM announced the $7.2 billion deal last year, executives said the time was right to return to the medical waste sector due in part to the expanding population of aging people. 

The WM Healthcare Solutions business is expected to grow about 9% in 2025, which WM says will likely be driven by organic revenue growth and initiatives such as fleet and asset optimization.

WM had previously dabbled in the space on and off over the years, but hadn't become a major presence in the sector until recently, due in part to competition from companies like Stericycle, analysts said. In 2005, the company launched Waste Management Healthcare Solutions to provide regulated medical waste services for hospitals and other large waste generators, with the goal of becoming a major player in the industry. Yet by 2013 they had eased off those plans, noting medical waste represented less than $50 million of revenue. WM later sold most of its remaining medical waste assets.

Today, WM is following specific medical waste trends that will offer opportunities for new and expanded business, said Rafa Carrasco, president of WM Healthcare Solutions via email. “Sites of care for patients are significantly changing, with a growing trend towards receiving care in outpatient settings like ambulatory surgery centers, retail clinics, and even at home,” he said. 

Carrasco says the future demand for at-home care is a particularly notable trend, as it is expected to generate more waste, including waste from self-injectable medications meant to treat chronic illnesses. That in turn will lead to “more demand for proper medical and pharmaceutical waste disposal options.”

WM entered a highly competitive market when it broke back into the medical waste space, Carrasco said. One type of competitor is what Carrasco calls “large-quantity waste generators,” including some hospitals, which currently have their own onsite treatment processes such as autoclaves. Others in the medical waste space have made a name for themselves by specializing in either collection or transportation services.

Yet WM sees itself as being in an ideal position to offer treatment options alongside collection and transportation, which will help medical facilities simplify and streamline the waste management process, Carrasco said. WM Healthcare Services is positioned to do this because Stericycle already had an “extensive treatment and transportation infrastructure” as well as route density and overall knowledge of market dynamics, he said.  

WM Healthcare Services is currently working to integrate numerous aspects of Stericycle's operations, namely the new 110,000-square-foot medical waste incinerator project Stericycle completed in October in McCarran, Nevada. The $110 million, designed to accept material from hospitals and healthcare systems in the Western U.S., has gone through testing and is now ramping up operations, Carrasco said. Stericycle has 18 medical waste incinerator facilities around the world, according to WM's most recent securities filings.

The company expects to process 70% of volumes from Stericycle's Western customers by the end of March, and should be able to process all the remaining volumes from that region by the end of May, he said. The facility is expected to be fully operational by the end of December. 

In filings, WM underscored the importance of integrating Stericycle's assets and operations, which will take “a significant degree of difficulty and management attention” due to the size of the deal. 

Over the next three years, WM expects synergies from the deal to be about $250 million, with about $100 million of that in 2025. During a January earnings call, CEO Jim Fish also noted that WM would identify medical facilities that could benefit from cross-selling opportunities, starting as early as 2026.

WM is also in the process of identifying what to do with other elements of Stericycle's business and assets. Stericycle had 69 autoclaves and facilities described as “alternative medical waste treatment facilities, as well as 167 transfer stations as of December 31. WM listed 35 of Stericycle's locations as "held for sale,” according to filings. 

One recent deal, completed on January 2, was the divestiture of all Stericycle businesses in Spain and Portugal to Urbaser, an international environmental solutions company. Stericycle continues to operate in other markets in Western Europe, Carrasco said. 

WM is still operating Stericycle's services under the Stericycle name, but that will change in coming years. WM will eventually rebrand those services under the WM Healthcare Solutions umbrella, which “will take some time to complete,” he said.

The National Health Service of England will no longer be an independent organization supported by the British government. By slashing duplication, the Department of Health and Social Care said it will reduce unnecessary administrative spending and empower NHS staff to deliver better care for patients. 

"We now need to bring NHS England and DHSC together so we can deliver the biggest bang for our buck for patients, as we look to implement the three big shifts – analog to digital, sickness to prevention and hospital to community – and build an NHS fit for the future," said Sir James Mackey, NHS England Transition CEO, in a statement.

WHY IT MATTERS

Reversing a major top-down decision ushered in by former Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012, Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on March 13 that the move to slash the £200 billion of taxpayer money it takes to operate NHS England would free up NHS itself to focus more on patients.

"That money could and should be spent on nurses, doctors, operations, GP appointments," Starmer said in a video posted by Financial Times.

Earlier in the week, NHS England staff were warned of job cuts of up to 50%, and several senior officials resigned, according to the story. 

NHS England's incoming chair, Dr. Penny Dash, said in an agency statement that she will "work to bring together NHS England and DHSC to reduce duplication and streamline functions."

"When money is so tight, we cannot justify such a complex bureaucracy with two organizations doing the same jobs," Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said in the announcement about resorbing NHS England. "We need more doers and fewer checkers, which is why I'm devolving resources and responsibilities to the NHS frontline."

"We know that while unsettling for our staff, today's announcement will bring welcome clarity as we focus on tackling the significant challenges ahead and delivering on the government's priorities for patients," Mackey added.

Streeting noted that the creation of the NHS England bureaucracy "led to the longest waiting times, lowest patient satisfaction and most expensive NHS in history."

The number of people working for NHS more than doubled since 2010, when the NHS delivered its shortest waiting times and the highest patient satisfaction, the agency said.

DHSC also said that a centralized model could procure cutting-edge technology more rapidly at a lower cost and work more closely with the life sciences sector to advance treatments.

"If it's done well, with meaningful alignment between innovation, procurement and delivery, it could genuinely transform services and patient experience," Dr. Rachael Grimaldi, cofounder and CEO of CardMedic, said in a statement shared with several media outlets.

Dr. Rachael Fox, executive vice president of UK and EMEA for Altera Digital Health, said digital maturity and transformation have progressed across the NHS, including the interoperability of patient information.

"To support recovery and true reform, it's essential that momentum with innovation to drive better patient outcomes is maintained while we work through this transition," she said.

THE LARGER TREND

Mackey noted NHS England has played a vital role in improving the nation's health, including leading COVID-19 vaccinations and introducing "the latest, most innovative new treatments for patients."

In October, NHS England rolled out radiology artificial intelligence across 10 health trusts providing access to more than 75 regulatory-approved AI technologies from a single platform created by Deepc, an AI company.

NHS England said at the time that in rapidly deploying radiology AI, it could help reduce wait times for patients, increase the speed of diagnoses and help relieve pressure on NHS radiology departments.

ON THE RECORD

"Just because reform is difficult does not mean it should not be done," Streeting said in a statement. "This government will never duck the hard work of reform. We will take on vested interests and change the status quo."

                Doctors in New York will have to discuss treatment costs upfront with patients under a new law.

The routine is familiar for most people: When checking in for an appointment with a doctor or other health care provider, patients typically complete and sign a pile of paperwork, including a form that contains some version of the statement, "I agree to pay for all charges not covered by my insurance company."

Patients may not feel comfortable making that financial promise, often before they have any idea what the charges will be. But they generally sign the form anyway, because the alternative is often not to get the services they're seeking.

As a result, consumers may be responsible for unexpected bills and at risk for medical debt.

In New York, state officials, advocates and the health care provider community have been engaged in a policy tug-of-war over efforts to protect consumers. Patient advocates don't want them to get stuck signing blank-check forms that put them in financial jeopardy. Doctors, hospitals and other providers don't want to disrupt their practices' workflow and payment logistics with cost discussions and paperwork, especially after services have been provided. 

State officials' efforts to find a satisfying compromise have so far fallen short.

At the center is a state law that took effect last fall to prohibit requiring patients to sign such consent-to-pay forms before they've received treatment and discussed the costs.

Legal analysts described it as the first such law in the country. Physician groups cried foul, saying it would raise payment issues and other significant logistical problems.

Those concerns found traction. Shortly before the law's start date, the state's health department delayed its implementation indefinitely. In addition, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul's proposed fiscal year 2026 budget would let providers go back to requiring patients to agree to pay for care in advance of receiving treatment. It also clarified that the consent requirements would not apply to emergency care.

A key provision of the new law would remain in place, however: Doctors and other providers would still be obligated to have the cost discussion with patients before the patient is asked to sign the form agreeing to pay for the service. 

Some consider even the remaining provision a significant step.

"Providers having an affirmative obligation to discuss treatment costs is unique," said Gregory Mitchell, a partner in the health and life sciences practice group at McDermott Will & Emery law firm who specializes in managed care. Clients from around the country have been reaching out to the law firm with questions.

Requiring providers to discuss costs with patients, whether before or after services are provided, would pose a "significant burden," he said. Doctors and other providers typically don't know specifics about patient deductibles, cost sharing or other insurance coverage details until after a claim is submitted to a health plan.

Health care services are different than refrigerators or other goods that people buy, doctors say. If a patient gets a colonoscopy and doesn't want to pay for it, "it's not possible to take the service back," said Jerome Cohen, a gastroenterologist and the president of the Medical Society of the State of New York, which represents physicians. 

As for the proposed changes in the 2026 budget, Cohen said the medical society "very much appreciates the governor's efforts to try to fix this problematic financial consent requirement."

But patient advocates are pushing back. The current practice is "unfair and it's wrong," said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Service Society of New York, a nonprofit that has successfully pushed for passage of several medical debt-related laws in recent years. No patient should ever have to preemptively agree to pay whatever a provider charges, Benjamin said.

In a written response to questions, Danielle De Souza, a spokesperson for the New York Department of Health, said that the proposed law change is justified, "given the burden of this requirement on both patients and providers." De Souza didn't respond to a request for clarification about what those patient burdens are.

Helen Krim walked out of a doctor's office in the Bronx borough of New York City a few years ago rather than sign an open-ended form agreeing to pay for any services recommended by the doctor.

It was the first time that Krim, who is covered by Medicare, had visited that primary care practice. When she told them she didn't want to sign the form, she was told they wouldn't serve her unless she did.

"I'm one of those annoying people who actually reads the forms," the retired bank project manager said. "It's kind of like signing a consent to be scammed." She found another practice that didn't ask her to sign a similar form.

There are other consumer medical debt protections at the federal and state level. The federal No Surprises Act restricts providers from billing consumers for out-of-network services in certain instances. It also requires providers to give good-faith cost estimates for self-pay patients. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a final rule in January that would have removed medical debt from people's credit reports, but the rule's implementation has been frozen by the Trump administration.

Several states besides New York have also taken steps to protect consumers with medical debt.

Benjamin said that simply requiring an unspecified "discussion" about costs doesn't address patients' potential unlimited financial liability. Under a bill that Benjamin's organization has drafted, providers would have to give patients a written good-faith estimate of their expected costs before the patient receives services and patients could not be held liable for unlimited or unspecified costs beyond that estimate.

"Let's be the first state to really have fair rules of engagement for both the providers and the patients about what is it that you're agreeing to be financially liable for at the point, beforehand," Benjamin said.

So far, though, the measure has not been introduced, with the focus in Albany on the governor's budget proposal.

Providers, too, are taking a wait-and-see attitude, Mitchell said, because the budget plan must still move through the legislative process.

Another New York medical debt-related law that took effect in October takes aim at the use of credit cards to pay for medical services. The Hochul administration has not proposed changing it. The law prohibits providers from requiring pre-authorization of credit cards or keeping a patient's card on file. It also requires providers to notify patients of the risks of paying for medical care with credit cards, which may lack medical debt protections. In addition, providers aren't allowed to help patients complete credit card applications under the law.

The laws are aimed at stopping unfair billing practices and reducing medical debt for New Yorkers. Earlier laws ban credit reporting of all medical debt, prohibit hospitals from suing patients with incomes under 400% of the poverty level, among other things.

New York providers don't like the credit card law either, though it hasn't generated the pushback seen with the consent-to-pay law.

In a statement, Brian Conway, a spokesperson for the Greater New York Hospital Association, said: "It's important to clarify that hospitals do not oppose the goals of the hospital financial assistance law reforms overall, but rather the operational burdens and patient disclosure overload that a few specific provisions create."

Tampa General Hospital (TGH) and Boston-based Mass General Brigham (MGB) are collaborating on a radiation oncology center, offering a new option for cancer care to Floridians in and around Palm Beach County.

The center is expected to offer more modern medical technology in addition to improved access and a "coordinated patient experience."

Construction costs for the new facility were not disclosed.

"This new center represents a significant evolution in the partnership between TGH and MGB, as we continue to execute our overall strategy to transform healthcare through innovation and collaboration with the nation's leading providers and physician-scientists," said John Couris, president and CEO of Tampa General.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

Under the partnership, TGH and MGB will open a 10,000-square-foot, co-branded and jointly owned radiation oncology center at Legacy Place in Palm Beach Gardens.

TGH will manage day-to-day operations, while MGB Radiation Oncology will provide expert quality and safety oversight.

In adhering to the tenets of academic medicine, the collaboration will create an integrated team of experts to address a spectrum of patient needs, from physicians and dosimetrists to patient advocates and administrators.

All members of the team will cross-collaborate, share and support each other to deliver responsive and customized care, the hospitals said.

The new center will be open for patient care in 2026.

THE LARGER TREND

According to the Florida Department of Health, for more than a decade, cancer has been the second leading cause of death in Florida, after heart disease. And the state has the second-highest cancer burden in the nation, with an average of 115,000 new cancers diagnosed and reported each year.

ON THE RECORD

"As we look to provide the most innovative, patient-centric cancer care possible across Florida, this new center and elevated collaboration with MGB is critical to achieving this goal" said Dr. Abe Schwarzberg, executive vice president and chief of Oncology at Tampa General and president of Tampa General Provider Network. "We've already seen how our collaboration can benefit the patients we serve, and by working alongside MGB to provide our patients with access to the expertise, experience and research findings from two of the top academic health systems, we have the potential to make a significant impact on their treatment outcomes."

Mr. Settle joins RCCB as Senior Counsel to expand and enhance its healthcare transactional and regulatory practice within the Corporate & Business Group, further strengthening the firm's ability to navigate the evolving healthcare landscape. His deep industry knowledge and strong relationships will be instrumental in growing RCCB's presence in the healthcare sector.



With four decades of experience, Mr. Settle has held senior and chief counsel roles at leading health insurance companies, including Aetna, UnitedHealthcare, and AmeriHealth Caritas, a key subsidiary of Independence Blue Cross. He also served as Deputy General Counsel to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, overseeing health and environmental affairs, and was more recently appointed by Governor Josh Shapiro as part of the administration's Transition Advisory Committee for Health and Human Services, Healthcare Sub-Committee.

Beyond his legal career, Mr. Settle has been deeply involved in healthcare policy and advocacy, serving as a hospital trustee, leading the successful effort for the passage of Pennsylvania Act 62—which mandated insurance coverage for children with autism—and supporting disadvantaged children through his long-standing role with the Early Head Start Program at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Mr. Settle also spent five years as a wealth management executive at Alliance Bernstein. Most recently, he was recruited by the Forward Party, a new national centrist party led by Andrew Yang and Governor Christine Todd Whitman to run for Attorney General of Pennsylvania. His campaign was well received, and he earned over 18,000 votes in all 67 counties contributing to the advancement of the party's efforts.

"Eric's work and connections in the healthcare industry, law, government and public policy make him a tremendous asset to our firm and our clients," said Neil Cooper, Executive Partner of RCCB. "Healthcare is a complex and rapidly evolving industry, and Eric's skills and experience will allow us to further service clients across the full spectrum of transactional and regulatory matters."

Mr. Settle's work in healthcare law includes transactions, dispute resolution, regulatory compliance, value-based care models, and payer-provider partnerships. He played key roles in major healthcare mergers, including Aetna's acquisition of NY Life and Prudential Health's businesses, and played a lead role in structuring an innovative commercial health plan joint venture with Jefferson Health System on behalf of United Healthcare. His work in public affairs and consulting has positioned him as a trusted advisor to companies, investors, providers, payors, innovators, and government agencies navigating the evolving healthcare landscape.

Joining RCCB marks a return to private practice for Mr. Settle after three decades in government, corporate and public affairs roles. Encouraged by longtime friend and RCCB Executive Partner Mr. Cooper, he was drawn to the firm's dynamic growth, entrepreneurial culture, and commitment to providing innovative legal solutions.

"I've watched RCCB grow over the past decade and have been consistently impressed by the caliber of lawyers joining the firm. Many of them, like me, saw an opportunity to practice law in a better way," said Mr. Settle. "After spending years advising businesses and policymakers, I realized I wanted to get back to practicing law and building something new. RCCB provides the perfect platform to launch a healthcare-focused practice that integrates regulatory expertise with corporate strategy."

With Mr. Settle's addition, RCCB strengthens its ability to guide healthcare clients through transactions, regulatory compliance, and strategic partnerships. His hands-on roles with healthcare mergers, investments, and payer-provider collaborations provides RCCB clients with a distinct advantage.

"There are significant opportunities in healthcare today—whether through mergers, private equity investments, or innovative payer-provider collaborations," Mr. Settle noted. "Having spent my career inside large healthcare organizations, I understand how these deals come together and how to navigate the regulatory complexities that come with them."

Beyond his professional achievements, Mr. Settle remains deeply involved in philanthropy and community service. He served as President of Main Line Reform Temple and continues his service as a trustee and investment committee chair, leading the effort to create a permanent endowment, as well as a governing board member of the Early Head Start Program at CHOP. He has also served as a Trustee at Colgate University and Bryn Mawr Rehab Hospital and Foundation and held leadership roles with the Philadelphia Bar Association and the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia. He resides in Bryn Mawr, PA, with his wife.

Most people with unsuppressed HIV in a large population study in Uganda were already diagnosed but not in clinical care, suggesting that re-engaging people with HIV and ensuring that they are receiving antiretroviral treatment could have a substantial impact on HIV transmission.

The findings were presented last week at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI 2025) in San Francisco.

A second study presented at the conference showed that men with HIV disengaged from care in Malawi were more likely to return to care if they received a supportive low-cost counselling intervention tailored to address the challenges that men face in taking antiretroviral treatment and remaining in care. A third study, carried out in Zambia, found that an intervention to encourage welcoming and supportive behaviours among care providers significantly improved return to care and retention in care among people who had interrupted treatment.  

The Ugandan study, carried out by the Rakai Health Sciences research group, investigated what proportion of the population in this rural district had detectable HIV viremia, and how many of these people were already diagnosed but disengaged from care.

When viral load is detectable, this indicates that HIV is replicating in the body. If the person is taking HIV treatment but their viral load is detectable, the treatment is not working properly. There may still be a risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners.

A patient's regular and ongoing engagement with medical care at a health care facility. 

A group of participants in a trial who receive standard treatment, or no treatment at all, rather than the experimental treatment which is being tested. Also known as a control arm.



The presence of virus in the blood.



A healthcare professional's recommendation that a person sees another medical specialist or service.

The study recruited people aged 15-49 in 34 communities and carried out HIV testing. Everyone who tested positive for HIV received a qualitative viral load test which can detect viral load above 1000 copies/ml. Viral load above this level is associated with a risk of HIV transmission. Participants were asked about their HIV status and any past or current antiretroviral use.

People newly diagnosed with HIV during the study were referred to a clinic for HIV treatment and followed up three months later to confirm that they had started treatment.

Anyone previously diagnosed with HIV was referred to a clinic for treatment. Those who had never started treatment were followed up three months later to confirm that they had started treatment.

The study tested 17,841 people; 3170 tested positive for HIV, 3134 underwent viral load testing and 316 (10%) had viral load above 1000 copies/ml. Just over half of those with detectable viral load (54%) said they were newly diagnosed with HIV, 10% said they had not started treatment, 33% said they were in care and 2.5% were previously in care.

However, after looking for clinical records and carrying out testing for antiretroviral drugs, a different picture emerged. In fact, one in five people who said they were newly diagnosed turned out to be already diagnosed but had not started treatment or had dropped out of care. Altogether, 83% of people with viremia were not in clinical care and three-quarters of this group had never started treatment.



Men, and people over 30 years of age, were more likely to have been misclassified.

A blood test to detect antiretroviral drugs showed that only 4% of those with viremia had any detectable antiretroviral drugs in their bloodstream, all of whom were currently in care.

Half of those who had started treatment dropped out within a year. At the time of the study, the median time since the last clinic visit was 2.8 years.

A randomised trial carried out in Malawi showed that men with HIV who received person-centred counselling delivered by lay people were just as likely to return to care and stay in care as men who received more complex and costly interventions.

The study, carried out through the Partners in Hope NGO in Malawi, recruited 569 men living with HIV who had been traced from chart reviews at 13 health facilities. Men were eligible for inclusion in the study if they had been diagnosed with HIV but had not initiated antiretroviral treatment or had interrupted treatment.

Participants were randomised to one of three study arms:

The primary outcome of the study was the proportion of participants in each arm who had initiated ART within three months of enrolment and had been out of care for less than 28 days by six months after treatment initiation.

Study participants had a mean age of 39 years and 91% had previously started treatment. Participants had been on treatment for a median of 12 months and out of care for a median of two months at the time of enrolment.



At nine months after enrolment, there was no significant difference in ART engagement between study arms (76% in the counselling arm vs 72% in the home-based ART arm and 85% in the stepped intervention arm).

In-depth interviews with 92 participants found that the elements of interventions most valued by the participants was counselling and positive interactions with healthcare workers. Kind and interactive counselling that offered tailored solutions and compelling messages was more important than dispensing ART at home, the interviews showed.

Treatment interruptions can be attributable to poor experiences of health care and fears about returning to care after missed appointments. Researchers at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia and universities in the United States designed an intervention to promote friendlier, more person-centred attitudes in healthcare staff, using training and coaching, measurement and feedback, and facility-level incentives such as recognition for staff.

To evaluate the effect of the intervention on client return to care after treatment interruption and sustained engagement in care, the researchers conducted a randomised trial involving 24 health facilities between August 2019 and November 2021. During the study period, 128,901 people with HIV were more than 30 days late and were judged to have interrupted treatment. Sixty-four per cent of those who interrupted treatment were female, most (66%) were aged 25-44 and one-third had been on treatment for at least five years.



During the one-year follow-up period, 65% of the control group and 71% of the intervention group returned to care, a risk difference of 5.7%. Among those who returned to care, people in the intervention group were less likely to experience another treatment interruption during the follow-up period (55% vs 44%, risk difference 10.4%). After one year, a total of 73% in the control group and 82% in the intervention group were still in care after returning to care. Overall, 49% of the control group and 58% of the intervention group were in care one year after the study began.

Researchers from the Viking Genes research project identified 108 genetic variants – differences in a person's DNA – in 23 genes, which can be linked to conditions like cancer and heart disease. These results were then communicated to participants, giving them the opportunity to undertake personalised treatment for their condition. Experts say it is one of the UK's first extensive efforts in returning clinically actionable genetic results to people involved in the study. 

These ground-breaking new results from the Viking Genes project underscore the critical role of genetic research in foreseeing and forestalling disease

After receiving a letter advising him of a variant in the BRCA2 gene, one volunteer underwent tests that showed he had prostate cancer. He underwent a successful operation in February to remove his prostate and is already back at work on his fishing boat. The research also revealed that 10 of these disease-causing variants were much more common in either Orkney or Shetland than elsewhere in the UK. Experts say the findings demonstrate the power of targeted genetic screening to help improve the health of people from isolated communities. 

Viking Genes, led by experts at the University of Edinburgh, is investigating the genetics and health of volunteers with at least two grandparents from the Hebrides, Shetland or Orkney. In this latest study, researchers analysed the genetic data of 4,198 participants and found small differences known to affect health in about 2.5% of them. 

NHS Grampian clinical genetics services verified the findings before 64 consenting participants were notified about their results, with experts adhering to recently introduced international guidelines developed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for returning genomic results. The study, which involved researchers the University of Aberdeen and the Regeneron Genetics Center, is published in the American Journal of Human Genetics and was funded by the Medical Research Council. The letters were funded by a Wellcome Trust Institutional Translational Partnership Award (iTPA), through the iTPA team at Edinburgh Innovations.    

"These ground-breaking new results from the Viking Genes project underscore the critical role of genetic research in foreseeing and forestalling disease," said Professor Jim Flett Wilson, Chair of Human Genetics at the University of Edinburgh. "By tailoring our approach to fit specific genetic backgrounds, we can offer more precise, predictive, and preventative healthcare, thereby protecting communities, preserving health and saving lives. The results of this study provide a foundation for creating bespoke genetic screening programs for the Scottish Islanders and other unique genetic populations." 

Since 2005, Viking Genes has recruited over 10,000 volunteers from the Northern and Western Isles of Scotland — regions known for their unique gene pools due to historical isolation and limited migration. This distinct genetic background provides a powerful tool to identify rare but medically significant genetic variants, experts say. It has previously identified clusters of rare breast and ovarian cancers in Shetland and Orkney involving the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.
