Platform X, formerly known as Twitter, suffered multiple outages on March 10.

Thousands of X users in the US and UK reported being unable to access the app throughout the day.

It is reported that owner Elon Musk attributed the outages to a "massive cyberattack" and claimed that "IP addresses originating from the Ukraine area" were behind it.

With reported issues peaking at 40,000 on Downdetector, the extent of the outage is beyond doubt.

It is the most significant service outage the platform has suffered in years, with the effects of the outage lasting for several hours.

But what exactly caused the outage?

Here are the original theories, followed by the opinions of cybersecurity experts.

Claim: Ukraine-based hackers were behind the cyberattack on X

After X's interruption, question marks remain over its cause – and who could be behind it, writes yahoonews, the Telegraph reports.

Elon Musk continues to claim that behind him is "a large, coordinated group with IP addresses from the Ukraine area."

Reality: it is impossible to determine the true source of the attack on X

Analysts across the web are broadly united in their understanding that X suffered a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.

This is traditionally a fairly crude form of cyberattack.

It floods a target's servers, exceeding their capacity and preventing real users from accessing the website in question.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ciaran Martin – a professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government and former head of the UK's National Cyber ​​Security Centre – described the technique as "not that sophisticated".

Some experts suggest the opposite.

David Mound said in a statement that "DDoS attack tactics have evolved dramatically."

He noted that "attackers now distribute traffic across entire subnets."

It is reported that some experts have pointed out that DDoS attacks are usually orchestrated using a battalion of devices across the globe.

Traffic tends to be generated from IP addresses that are distributed across different regions, making it difficult to pinpoint where the attack originated.

Speaking to Wired, Shawn Edwards, chief security officer of Zayo, a network connectivity company, said that "attackers often use compromised devices, VPNs or proxy networks to obscure their true origins."

As a result, it is difficult to determine the true source of an attack.

However, even if it comes from a specific country, as Musk suggested, that doesn't mean the cyberattackers were based in that country.

Incidentally, Wired quoted an anonymous researcher who stated that none of the 20 main sources involved in the attack were located in Ukraine.

If correct, this would contradict Musk's statement regarding Ukrainian hackers.

Otherwise, there appears to be no evidence behind his claim that the IP addresses involved in the attack originated in Ukraine.

But, this does not mean that a state actor could not be involved.

Another question is how the attack was able to affect X significantly.

DDoS attacks are relatively common, with Musk himself announcing that X is “attacked every day.”

So why did this attack bring down X?

Musk is keen to suggest that a group with vast resources is behind him.

However, a number of independent analysts have identified that the platform's servers were not properly secured, leaving them publicly exposed to attack. /Telegraph/

Belgian offshore installation contractor Jan De Nul, in consortium with Greek cables supplier Hellenic Cables has signed a framework agreement with National Grid for strategic HVDC interconnections in the U.K.

This agreement will entitle the consortium to participate in upcoming tenders for call-off projects for the design, manufacturing, supply, installation, testing, and commissioning of HVDC cable systems as part of National Grid's large-scale offshore and onshore transmission infrastructure investment program.

The deal, which has an initial term of five years with an option for extension of up to three additional years, is a key component of National Grid's strategy to secure long-term partnerships that support deliverability for critical projects in the UK.

The U.K. Government's commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2050 has placed significant emphasis on expanding the country's electricity grid infrastructure to integrate renewable energy sources, such as offshore wind.

National Grid's cable framework aims to support this transition, ensuring a robust and reliable energy network, and this framework will play a crucial role in enhancing grid resilience, facilitating renewable energy integration and ensuring energy security for the future.

The consortium will participate in potential future tenders for turnkey projects.

“We are proud to partner with National Grid through this framework for strategic HVDC interconnections. The agreement confirms our position as World Builders of the energy transition through providing vital power cable links,” said Wouter Vermeersch, Director Subsea Cables Offshore Energy at Jan De Nul.

“This agreement strengthens our commitment to supporting the UK's energy transition and offshore wind ambitions. We are proud to be part of this critical framework, providing world-class HVDC cable solutions,” added Kostas Savvakis, General Manager, Hellenic Cables.

The Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited has introduced a youth empowerment initiative targeting the North-West region of Nigeria. The programme aims to equip participants with advanced technological skills and improve broadband access in remote areas.

The initiative, featuring a Space-Tech Hackathon and Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) training, is scheduled to take place in Dutse, Jigawa, from April 7 to 11.

In a statement issued in Abuja, Aisha Bantam, NIGCOMSAT's Head of Corporate Affairs, confirmed that the programme is designed to engage university students, start-ups, and local innovators from Kaduna, Kano, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Katsina, and Jigawa states.

Interested participants can register via the official link: https://bit.ly/VSAT_JIGAWA.

NIGCOMSAT previously organised a similar programme in the North-East, hosting a regional Space-Tech Hackathon in Yola, Adamawa State, from February 24 to 28. That event, co-hosted with the Adamawa State Government, focused on grassroots innovation in satellite technology, driving economic and social impact.

Providing further details, NIGCOMSAT's Managing Director, Jane Egerton-Idehen, highlighted that the five-day event would offer mentorship and hands-on experience in satellite technology.

“The hackathon provides participants with a platform to identify challenges, generate ideas, develop prototypes, and receive expert mentorship,” she explained.

She also announced that the winning team from the hackathon would be enrolled in the NIGCOMSAT Accelerator Programme Cohort 2025, where they will receive further support to develop and implement their projects.

Beyond the hackathon, Egerton-Idehen revealed that 100 youths will receive specialised training in VSAT installation, a crucial technology for expanding broadband access in underserved communities.

Egerton-Idehen reiterated that the overarching goal of the initiative is to inspire technological innovation, tackle community challenges, and reduce youth unemployment across Nigeria.

She also confirmed that the North-West Hackathon and VSAT training will be jointly hosted by Jigawa State and NIGCOMSAT Ltd.

The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are warning against a dangerous ransomware scheme.In an advisory posted earlier this week, government officials warned that a ransomware-as-a-service software called Medusa, which has launched ransomware attacks since 2021, has recently affected hundreds of people.

Medusa uses phishing campaigns as its main method for stealing victims' credentials, according to CISA. To protect against the ransomware, officials recommended patching operating systems, software and firmware, in addition to using multifactor authentication for all services such as email and VPNs.

Experts also recommended using long passwords, and warned against frequently recurring password changes because they can weaken security. Medusa developers and affiliates — called “Medusa actors” — use a double extortion model, where they “encrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid,” the advisory said.

Medusa operates a data-leak site that shows victims alongside countdowns to the release of information. “Ransom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets,” the advisory said.

“At this stage, Medusa concurrently advertises sale of the data to interested parties before the countdown timer ends. Victims can additionally pay $10,000 USD in cryptocurrency to add a day to the countdown timer.”

Since February, Medusa developers and affiliates have hit more than 300 victims across industries, including the medical, education, legal, insurance, technology and manufacturing sectors, CISA said.
