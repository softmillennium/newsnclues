The Gemini 2.0 Flash model appears to have precious few guardrails, and in addition to removing watermarks, it can generate images of famous personalities and copyrighted animated characters without any fuss. Notably, only last week, Google had expanded access to Gemini 2.0 Flash’s image generation feature. This particular feature is ‘experimental’ and ‘not for production use’ as of now, and is only available for use on Google’s developer-facing tools like AI Studio. And even though it appears to be immaculately skilled at removing watermarks and filling in any gaps that are left after a particular watermark is removed, it isn’t perfect at executing this job. It apparently struggles with semi-transparent watermarks and those that cover a wide expanse of images. The partnership allows PicsArt’s new AI image generation tool to create images “with commercial rights and an indemnity,”. Here, PicsArts used licensed Getty Images to train its AI models. Meanwhile, closer home, China has announced ‘identification measures’ stipulating that AI-generated content should have human and machine-readable notifications. An important point to note here is that Chinese regulators likely drew inspiration from the EU’s AI Act, usually considered to be the most comprehensive legal framework aimed at regulating AI thus far. “Chinese policymakers and scholars have said that they’ve drawn on the EU’s Acts as inspiration for things in the past,” said Jeffrey Ding, an Assistant Professor of Political Science at George Washington University.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Google’s new Gemini Flash 2.0 image generation tool is capable of removing watermarks from copyrighted images, users on social media have found. The model is currently in its “experimental” phase, and only available to developers. Apple Intelligence includes a tool called “Clean up” on iOS and macOS that enables this for supported devices. The post below on X shows how well Gemini Flash 2.0 is at removing objects. New skill unlocked: Gemini 2 Flash model is really awesome at removing watermarks in images! Major closed models from the likes of Google and OpenAI are typically “nerfed,” meaning they have significant restrictions in place to avoid legal trouble. The latter’s Dall-E image model will not generate images of copyrighted characters, for instance. Microsoft recently sued a group of individuals who managed to trick its image models into generating porn. Do not fear, /r/photoshoprequest, as Google will almost certainly attempt to reign in watermark removals. But by demonstrating that it is putting in effort to prevent misuse, Google protects itself from legal responsibility.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/roku-says-unpopular-autoplay-ads-are-just-a-test/'>“Awful”: Roku tests autoplaying ads loading before the home screen</a></h2><b>Source:</b> arstechnica&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 19:34:22 <p>
Owners of smart TVs and streaming sticks running Roku OS are already subject to video advertisements on the home screen. Now, Roku is testing what it might look like if it took things a step further and forced people to watch a video ad play before getting to the Roku OS home screen.

Reports of Roku customers seeing video ads automatically play before they could view the OS’ home screen started appearing online this week. A Reddit user, for example, posted yesterday: “I just turned on my Roku and got an unskippable ad for a movie, before I got to the regular Roku home screen.” Multiple apparent users reported seeing an ad for the movie Moana 2.

When reached for comment, a Roku spokesperson shared a company statement that confirms that the autoplaying ads are expected behavior but not a permanent part of Roku OS currently. Instead, Roku claimed, it was just trying the ad capability out.

Roku’s representative said that Roku’s business “has and will always require continuous testing and innovation across design, navigation, content, and our first-rate advertising products,” adding:

Our recent test is just the latest example, as we explore new ways to showcase brands and programming while still providing a delightful and simple user experience.

Roku didn't respond to requests for comment on whether it has plans to make autoplaying ads permanent on Roku OS, which devices are affected, why Roku decided to use autoplaying ads, or customer backlash.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/mickey-17-streaming-release-date-rumors-2000576978'>At This Point, Maybe Just Read the Book Behind Mickey 17 Instead</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 19:30:51 <p>
Despite delays en route to theaters, fans were eagerly anticipating Bong Joon Ho’s follow-up to his Oscar-winning triumph Parasite, especially since it was a sci-fi tale starring various versions of Robert Pattinson. After Mickey 17‘s tepid opening weekend, Variety reported that “the goofy sci-fi comedy ignited to $24 million overseas and more than $50 million globally, a decent start for an original film in the current theatrical landscape. It just cost way too much to ever turn a profit in this lifetime.” The trade once again offered praise—”It’s an impressive launch for a fresh, offbeat space odyssey about a disposable employee whose body is able to regenerate for science”—but then pointed out the film’s oversized budget ($118 million, plus $80 million on marketing) means it “needs to earn around $275 million to $300 million globally to get into the black during its big screen run.” That hasn’t happened; according to Box Office Mojo, the most recent total for Mickey 17 is just over $90 million worldwide. Warner Bros. hasn’t responded to io9’s query, so that detail remains unofficial and unconfirmed. Movie fans have, however, noticed a trend of under-performing theatrical releases hitting streaming sooner and sooner; to name one notable recent example, Lionsgate’s Borderlands made us go “yikes!” when it arrived on digital just three weeks after opening in theaters. Mickey 17 could certainly prove to be more of an at-home hit than it was on the big screen, and that could end up tipping the budget scales in its favor. But perhaps at this point your choice is even more crystal clear: pick up Edward Ashton’s fantastic source-material novel, Mickey7, which was released in 2022. As an added bonus you can also imagine the main character’s voice to… not be what Pattinson went with in Mickey17.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/iguanas-pulled-off-crazy-record-breaking-ocean-voyage-scientists-say-2000576890'>Iguanas Pulled Off ‘Crazy’ Record-Breaking Ocean Voyage, Scientists Say</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 19:30:10 <p>
Iguanas on the remote islands of Fiji may appear to live chill lives, but according to new research they had to work for it: by floating across thousands of miles of ocean on vegetation in the last 30 million years or so. Given the vast geographic distance between the two but their relative genetic proximity, a team of researchers concludes that, in the ancient past, a group of desert reptiles hitched a ride on floating debris and never looked back—somehow making it to Fiji and surviving there for about 34 million years. “The lineage of Fiji iguanas split from their sister lineage relatively recently, much closer to 30 million years ago, either post-dating or at about the same time that there was volcanic activity that could have produced land,” said Simon Scarpetta, a herpetologist and paleontologist at the University of San Francisco and lead author of the paper, in a University of California, Berkeley release. “They were also likely resilient to the conditions they faced on the way, such as lack of standing water and high temperatures.” As for timeline, Scarpetta said previous estimates for a trans-Pacific journey were between 4 to 12 months, though more recent simulations suggested a timeline of 2.5 to 4 months. If the team’s conclusions are correct, the ancestors of Fiji iguanas schlepped a staggering 5,000 miles (8,047 kilometers) from western North America to Fiji, riding on vegetative flotsam, fortuitous ocean currents, and a dream. “Iguanas and desert iguanas, in particular, are resistant to starvation and dehydration, so my thought process is, if there had to be any group of vertebrate or any group of lizard that really could make an 8,000 kilometer journey across the Pacific on a mass of vegetation, a desert iguana-like ancestor would be the one,” Scarpetta said. “That they reached Fiji directly from North America seems crazy,” said co-author Jimmy McGuire, a herpetologist at UC Berkeley, in the same release, “But alternative models involving colonization from adjacent land areas don’t really work for the time frame, since we know that they arrived in Fiji within the last 34 million years or so.” “One question worth pointing out regarding our study, though it would be difficult to test, is whether iguanas hopped across islands in the Pacific from North America to Fiji, rather than rafting in a single event,” Scarpetta added. “This is an intriguing possibility, though no fossils of Fijian iguanas are known from anywhere in the Pacific besides Fiji and Tonga, and volcanic islands, of which there are many in the Pacific, can be ephemeral.” Despite being isolated on remote islands, the four species of iguana on Fiji and Tonga are endangered due to a combination of habitat loss, predation, and the exotic pet trade.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

is a reviews editor who manages how-tos and various projects. I don’t want to sound alarmist or anything (although I admit I’m naturally pessimistic), but the way things are going, it’s a good idea to have an extra source of power for your home in case of storms and other outages. Luckily, EcoFlow is running a sale through March 26th, letting you save on several of its portable batteries and power stations. Our reviewer was very impressed with the Delta Pro 3, especially its versatility. It has the ability to power both 120V and 240V appliances, and can plug directly into your home’s circuit using an inlet box or manual transfer switch. It can be charged using 1000W and 16000 solar inputs or an AC wall charger, among other charging methods. And you can link multiple DP3 units together to increase their output, so that, say, three units connected to an EcoFlow Smart Home Panel 2 (which is also on sale at Amazon for $1,399, or $500 off) can provide enough power to keep a typical home running for a day and a half. On the other hand, if you’re just looking for something to use when camping or enjoying additional outdoor activities, EcoFlow’s River 3 Portable Power Station is down to $189 (from $338) at Amazon with a 45W solar panel, which nearly matches its all-time low. It can quickly charge appliances with anywhere from a 300W to 600W AC output, and uses its own solar panel to completely repower it in a little over six hours. If you’ve been thinking seriously about treating yourself with Apple’s latest iPad , now is the time: Amazon is already selling the 11-inch, 128GB device in yellow for $328.86, an approximate $20 discount (you can also get the blue, pink, and silver models for slightly more). The new base-model iPad is equipped with an A16 chip and 12-megapixel cameras on the front and back, but does not come with Apple Intelligence, which could be a distinct disadvantage. However, if that feature isn’t important to you, it’s definitely worth looking at. If you want something more colorful, but still want to save a bit of cash, the rose gold and red models are available for $114.99 at Amazon . It’s currently on sale at Best Buy and OnePlus for $849.99, a $50 discount.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On Monday, the company announced that it will launch a new prediction hub in its app that will allow people to “trade on the outcomes of some of the world’s biggest events,” which is apparently distinct from gambling in some way. Shortly before Trump took office, the CFTC accused Kalshi’s election contracts of being a “Trojan horse to facilitate Kalshi’s transformation into a large-scale election gambling market.” But don’t worry, Kalshi has quelled those fears by…adding Donald Trump, Jr. to its board of advisers. So, less “addressed outstanding concerns about unregulated gambling” and more “buddied up to the kid of the president,” but you know, same outcome! Robinhood has tried to get into the predictions game before. That, too stemmed from Kalshi, which was the exchange offering the contracts that Robinhood allowed its users to buy—but that seems to have resolved itself, as new CFTC acting Chairman Caroline Pham signaled these contracts will be allowed under the new administration. The whole argument here appears to be that you aren’t betting on odds set by a bookmaker but are instead purchasing a “derivatives contract” tied to the outcome of a specific event. That apparently makes it an investment and not a bet. A federal judge has upheld the legality of this kind of “investing” despite objections of the previous administration’s CFTC, so it seems like Robinhood probably has a green light here. Surely there is no social commentary to be found in the fact that the service that is supposedly “democratizing finance” (please do not bring up the time it literally stopped retail traders from purchasing or selling certain stocks because it was costing the wrong people money) is rapidly devolving into a platform for purely volatile and speculative “assets” like crypto and events predictions.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Take a look at the nearly completed worlds at Epic Universe that will transport theme park guests into their favorite adventures within the realms of Nintendo, Universal Monsters, Harry Potter, and How to Train Your Dragon. In about two months the park will open, welcoming people from all over world for Universal Orlando’s momentous occasion, and here’s a new look at the lands past the portals. From a scary adventure at Dark Universe to the gamer haven that is Super Nintendo World, to a magical place in the Ministry of Magic and a realm where real dragons exist at the Isle of Berk, we just wish to be there already! As pictured here, it will include the Yoshi’s Adventure ride; if you’ve seen the videos from the Japan version, you know it’s a very cute, family-friendly attraction. And of course this Nintendo World will add on one more big ticket ride alongside Mario Kart: Bowser’s Challenge—the off-the-rails Donkey Kong Mine-Cart Madness coaster. How to Train Your Dragon: Isle of Berk It’s a version of a cinematic environment inspired by DreamWorks’ hit franchise How to Train Your Dragon, which we haven’t seen brought to life like this. It’s just such a great concept to have a land where dragons are real and you can interact with them and see them soar (on stage at least, in the Untrainable Dragon stage show). Universal also posted a preview of how the amazingly awesome dragon meet-and-greets will work. This one looks the plainest of the lot with a circus tent plopped somewhere that may cause a bottle neck, but that’s nothing spell-casting can’t fix, surely.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A federal broadband official departed the US government with a warning that a Trump administration plan will strand rural Americans with worse Internet access in order to help Elon Musk secure public money for Starlink.

"Stranding all or part of rural America with worse Internet so that we can make the world's richest man even richer is yet another in a long line of betrayals by Washington," wrote Evan Feinman, who had been a Commerce Department official and director of the $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program since 2022.

As Politico reported, Feinman made the statement in "a blistering email to his former colleagues on his way out the door Sunday warning that the Trump administration is poised to unduly enrich Elon Musk's satellite Internet company with money for rural broadband."

Feinman left the department on Friday. His departure came less than two weeks after Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick announced that BEAD was reversing the Biden administration's decision to prioritize fiber Internet networks when distributing grants from the $42.45 billion fund.

ProPublica's Craig Silverman reported that "Feinman's term ended and he was not reappointed." Silverman also posted the full email sent by Feinman to colleagues.

Warning of “deeply negative outcomes”

Feinman wrote that he is "disappointed not to be able to see this project through" and that "the new administration seems to want to make changes that ignore the clear direction laid out by Congress, reduce the number of American homes and businesses that get fiber connections, and increase the number that get satellite connections."

The degree of the shift away from fiber "remains unknown, but regardless of size, it will be a disservice to rural and small-town America," he wrote. Feinman said some versions of the proposal are "benign," but he warned of "significant risk that the changes being proposed will be ill-considered and create deeply negative outcomes."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

And it’s unclear whether anything will stop Trump now that the country has reached such a lawless stage. Trump secretly invoked the Alien Enemies Act on Friday, a law from 1798 that gives the president enormous power in a time of war to deport people without judicial review. The president insists we are, but simply saying “we’re at war” because you don’t like immigrants in some abstract way isn’t how it’s done. But the fact that these people were deported under the Alien Enemies Act means they didn’t get a court hearing of any kind. El Salvador’s crypto-loving president Nayib Bukele tweeted about the court order early Sunday, sharing a screenshot of an article from the New York Post with a headline reading “Fed judge orders deportation flights carrying alleged Venezuelan gangbanger to return to US, blocks Trump from invoking Alien Enemies Act.” Bukele tweeted, “Ooopsi… Too late,” along with a crying-laughing emoji. Bukele says they’re being held there for a period of one year that can be renewed. An additional 23 alleged members of MS-13 were also transported there, according to the BBC. “Over time, these actions, combined with the production already being generated by more than 40,000 inmates engaged in various workshops and labor under the Zero Idleness program, will help make our prison system self-sustainable. There are other cases where the Trump administration appears to be defying court orders. Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a 34-year-old doctor, was reportedly detained Thursday at Boston Logan International Airport while flying into the U.S. from Lebanon. Alawieh reportedly held an H-1B visa working at Brown University’s medical school, according to CNN. And even though a court ordered she not be deported while the case was heard, the Trump regime apparently sent her back to Lebanon anyway. There was supposed to be a hearing Monday about Alawieh’s case but it was canceled because lawyers representing her withdrew, though it’s not clear why. Trump has made no secret of his fascist intentions for the United States. The president spoke at the Department of Justice on Friday in a particularly unhinged, though not surprising, speech denouncing perceived enemies, referring to them as “scum.” Trump at the DOJ: “There’s a guy named Norm Eisen. These are bad people … they’re scum.” [image or embed] — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) March 14, 2025 at 1:10 PM In a late-night post on Truth Social last night Trump declared that President Joe Biden’s pardons as he was leaving office were “void” because they were supposedly signed by auto-pen, a device often used by presidents of all political stripes to sign paperwork. It’s a ridiculous theory, but it’s the excuse Trump clearly wants to use to persecute people like former congresswoman Liz Cheney, a Republican who led a congressional investigation into his attempted self-coup on January 6, 2021. Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, appeared on Fox News Monday to say he doesn’t care what the judges think. That’s exactly why Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act. The ACLU is expected to bring up Bukele’s “oopsie” tweet, as well as a story published by Axios Sunday that quotes anonymous White House officials. “It’s the showdown that was always going to happen between the two branches of government,” a senior White House official told Axios. You have Venezuelan gang members … These are bad guys, as the president would say.” Trump is clearly starting with the people he believes will elicit little or no sympathy, even if they’re not actually gang members. Declaring them enemies is typically enough for Americans to believe they must be the bad guys. Lindsay Toczylowski, an attorney for one of the people deported, wrote on Bluesky that her client was only singled out because he has tattoos and is not a member of a gang. But ICE submitted photos of his tattoos as evidence he is Tren de Aragua,” Toczylowski wrote. “His @ImmDef attorney planned to present evidence he is not. But never got the chance because our client has been disappeared.” The Texas Department of Public Safety guide on how to spot gang tattoos certainly raises more questions than it answers. Unfortunately, it seems like things will only get dumber and more fascist from here.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This allows the same LINE account to be used on two main smartphones (iPhone or Android) and the sub Android smartphones.

The functions are limited on sub-device, and you cannot "Take over your LINE account", "Age verification", "Back up your talk history", "Purchase paid items such as stamps and emojis", or "Set up a theme."

If your sub-device is an iPhone, you will not be able to continue using the same LINE account as your main smartphone. The CNET editorial department is inquiring on LINE Yahoo, "Will we implement similar functions for iPhones in the future?" (Additional note) According to LINE Yahoo, there are currently no plans to support iPhones.

Previously, it was possible to have two LINE accounts if the sub-device was an iPad or PC. Additionally, using the LINE Lite app, which was no longer available in 2022, you could have owned two smartphones.

Since Amazon announced plans for a generative AI version of Alexa, we were concerned about user privacy. With Alexa+ rolling out to Amazon Echo devices in the coming weeks, we’re getting a clearer view of the privacy concessions people will have to make to maximize usage of the AI voice assistant and avoid bricking functionality of already-purchased devices. Amazon apparently sent the email to users with “Do Not Send Voice Recordings” enabled on their Echo. Starting on March 28, recordings of every command spoken to the Alexa living in Echo speakers and smart displays will automatically be sent to Amazon and processed in the cloud. Attempting to rationalize the change, Amazon’s email said: “As we continue to expand Alexa’s capabilities with generative AI features that rely on the processing power of Amazon’s secure cloud, we have decided to no longer support this feature.” One of the most marketed features of Alexa+ is its more advanced ability to recognize who is speaking to it, a feature known as Alexa Voice ID. To accommodate this feature, Amazon is eliminating a privacy-focused capability for all Echo users, even those who aren’t interested in the subscription-based version of Alexa or want to use Alexa+ but not its ability to recognize different voices. In 2023, Amazon agreed to pay $25 million in civil penalties over the revelation that it stored recordings of children’s interactions with Alexa forever. Adults also didn’t feel properly informed of Amazon’s inclination to keep Alexa recordings unless prompted not to until 2019—five years after the first Echo came out. Other reasons people may be hesitant to trust Amazon with personal voice samples include the previous usage of Alexa voice recordings in criminal trials and Amazon paying a settlement in 2023 in relation to allegations that it allowed "thousands of employees and contractors to watch video recordings of customers' private spaces" taken from Ring cameras, per the Federal Trade Commission. Likely looking to get ahead of these concerns, Amazon said in its email today that by default, it will delete recordings of users’ Alexa requests after processing. Voice ID enables Alexa to do things like share user-specified calendar events, reminders, music, and more. Alexa voice requests are always encrypted in transit to Amazon’s secure cloud, which was designed with layers of security protections to keep customer information safe. However, Amazon is betting big that Alexa+ can dig the voice assistant out of a financial pit. Amazon has publicly committed to keeping the free version of Alexa around, but Alexa+ is viewed as Amazon's last hope for keeping Alexa alive and making it profitable.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

According to China's Ministry of Finance, the 2025 central budget will allocate ¥398.12 billion yuan ($55 billion) for science and technology, a 10% increase from 2024. The increase in spending on science and technology by 10%, or $5 billion, emphasizes that China wants to accelerate its national R&D this year, which will speed up its plans for self-reliance in sectors such as semiconductors. $5 billion will not build the country a breakthrough but will rather help with existing projects, particularly in fields such as semiconductors, AI, space exploration, and quantum computing. Also, remember that China's economy is slowing, and the government frequently disguises economic stimulus plans within large-scale initiatives like this, allowing it to avoid directly labeling it as a stimulus. In 2024, China allocated ¥361.9 billion for science and technology expenditures, achieving 97.6% of the budgeted target. The government increased support for fundamental research to strengthen China's capabilities in cutting-edge scientific discovery and technological innovation. Investment was directed into major national initiatives, particularly in strategic sectors such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and space exploration. Last year, China also introduced support for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), including special financing programs to assist innovative SMEs with risk-sharing mechanisms through national financing guarantee funds. Governments tend to invest money into projects that may not pay off for years, so expect China to invest in fundamental research in the aforementioned areas. This will strengthen China's global competitiveness in these key industries in the coming years, which is particularly important for China's ongoing rivalry with the U.S.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

According to revenue data from "over 75,000" mobile apps, the vast majority have a hard time making $1,000 per month. The data is detailed in RevenueCat's 2025 State of Subscription Apps report. RevenueCat makes a mobile app subscription tool kit and gathered the report's data from apps using its platform. The report covers "more than $10 billion in revenue across more than a billion transactions," and RevenueCat's customer base ranges from indie-sized teams to large publishers. Buffer, ChatGPT, FC Barcelona, Goodnotes, and Reuters are among the San Francisco-based firm's customer base. All apps examined, though, actively generate subscription revenue and "meet a minimum threshold of installs or revenue (to ensure statistically meaningful findings," according to the report. RevenueCat's report doesn't cover every single mobile app available, but it paints a picture of the challenges related to monetizing mobile apps across different types of categories, as well as how uneven the distribution of app revenue is. RevenueCat's report concluded that most apps fail to make $1,000 in monthly revenue within their first two years. Photo, video, and gaming apps are the most likely to hit $1,000/month within two years. Meanwhile, lofty monthly revenue goals of $10,000/month are especially hard to reach for shopping and travel apps.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Microsoft's Windows updates over the last couple of years have mostly been focused on adding generative AI features to the operating system, including multiple versions of the Copilot assistant. Copilot has made it into Windows 11 (and even, to a more limited extent, the aging Windows 10) as a native app, and then a wrapper around a web app, and soon as a native app again.

But this month's Windows updates are removing the Copilot app from some Windows 11 PCs and unpinning it from the taskbar, according to this Microsoft support document. This bug obviously won't affect systems where Copilot had already been uninstalled, but it has already led to confusion among some Windows users.

Microsoft says it is "working on a resolution to address the issue" but that users who want to get Copilot back can reinstall the app from the Microsoft Store and repin it to the taskbar, the same process you use to install Copilot on PCs where it has been removed.

Though some version of Copilot has been included in fresh Windows 11 installs since mid-2023, and Microsoft even added a Copilot key into the standard Windows keyboard in early 2024, Copilot's appearance and capabilities have shifted multiple times since then.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Europe risks becoming totally reliant on non-domestic technology within three years if it does not invest in its tech industry, a group including Airbus, Proton and IONOS has warned. In an open letter, around 80 organisations backed recommendations made by the EuroStack initiative to focus less on regulation and more on investment through creation of a sovereign infrastructure fund and requirements for the public sector to “buy European”. It has been clear for some time that Europe cannot regulate itself out of its laggard position. Citing the US’ tariff war and the rising power of China’s tech industry, signatories warned that “without sweeping and urgent change”, Europe’s reliance on foreign technologies “will become almost complete in less than three years.” Addressed to European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen and tech sovereignty EVP Henna Virkkunen, the letter called for a sovereign fund to invest in “capital-intensive parts of the value chain” such as quantum computing. He said: “This is not just about competitiveness, it’s about security, autonomy and long-term sustainability in a world where digital infrastructure is as critical as energy and defense. In 2023 the seven largest US tech companies had a market value 20 times that of their EU counterparts, and not much has happened to indicate this may have changed. The EuroStack initiative, which first published a report on its recommendations in January, said one way to combat the size of US companies was by adopting a “pooling and federating” approach to sharing assets in an open source environment. However, Amanda Brock, CEO of open source development non-profit OpenUK, told The Stack that this approach risked dampening innovation and warned government “must understand that tech and AI development needs to be collaborative.” “This concept of localising a sovereign software stack risks bifurcating underlying open source and operating in silos is absolutely counter intuitive to what makes open source work."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Enforcement of a first-of-its-kind United Kingdom law that Elon Musk wants Donald Trump to gut kicked in today, with potentially huge penalties possibly imminent for any Big Tech companies deemed non-compliant. UK's Online Safety Act (OSA) forces tech companies to detect and remove dangerous online content, threatening fines of up to 10 percent of global turnover. In extreme cases, widely used platforms like Musk's X could be shut down or executives even jailed if UK online safety regulator Ofcom determines there has been a particularly egregious violation. Critics call it a censorship bill, listing over 130 "priority" offenses across 17 categories detailing what content platforms must remove. The list includes illegal content connected to terrorism, child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, illegal drugs, animal welfare, and other crimes. But it also broadly restricts content in legally gray areas, like posts considered "extreme pornography," harassment, or controlling behavior. Matthew Lesh, a public policy fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs, told The Telegraph that "the idea that Elon Musk, or any social media executive, could be jailed for failing to remove enough content should send chills down the spine of anyone who cares about free speech." Musk has publicly signaled that he expects Trump to intervene, saying, "Thank goodness Donald Trump will be president just in time," regarding the OSA's enforcement starting in March, The Telegraph reported last month. Attacking the OSA, Musk falsely claimed Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government was "releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts," FT reported. Such a post, if seen as spreading misinformation potentially inciting violence, could be banned under the OSA, the FT suggested.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The first is for Canada to flout U.S. intellectual property law and become a nation that exports jailbreaks. Last week Ontario Premiere Doug Ford announced a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the states before “suspending” it pending negotiations. It’s hard to know where all this ends up, how nasty it will get, and how much suffering people will endure. Canadian science fiction writer, tech journalist, and friend of Gizmodo Cory Doctorow had a great suggestion last month that would put incredible pressure on the U.S. “What if Canada stopped upholding U.S. tech companies’ intellectual property?” He asked in a paper for the Canada Centre for Policy Alternatives. Most app stores run by Amazon, Apple, or Google skim 30% off every transaction. John Deere farming equipment is hard to repair without paying the company for expensive software unlocks. Car companies, and especially Tesla, lock basic features behind electronic paywalls. Doctorow’s suggestion is that Canada not impose tariffs on U.S. goods but go back through its trade negotiations with America and “tear up these laws” that it agreed to regarding big tech’s IP. Canada could make app stores for the Android, Playstation and Xbox, too,” Doctorow said. He also suggested that the app store shouldn’t confine itself to Canadian software authors. “Canadian app stores could offer five per cent commissions on sales to U.S. and global software authors, and provide jailbreaking kits that allow device owners all around the world to install the Canadian app stores where software authors don’t get ripped off by American Big Tech companies.” That’s a much better deal than most of us get when we buy something on our phones. “What’s standing in the way of a Canadian industrial policy that focuses on raiding the sky-high margins of American monopolists with third-party add-ons, mods and jailbreaks?” Doctorow said. Another, sillier, suggestion has gone viral thanks to an Instagram reel from Canadian comedian Matthew Puzhitsky: ban PornHub. The pornography giant is based in Montreal and sees millions of American visitors every month. On March 6, Puzhitsky published a skit on Instagram where politicians looking for ways to win the trade war against Canada suggested banning the site. PornHub is already banned in 17 states (including Texas, Florida, and more), part of restrictive new laws in conservative parts of the country that force people to show an ID to access adult websites. Rather than comply with a law that is a privacy and technological nightmare, PornHub has blocked access to its services in those states.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

YouTubers Sahil Karoul and The Mobile Central posted reviews of the Pixel 9A, showing off its refreshed design and performance, as spotted earlier by Android Police.

Just like what we’ve seen in previous leaks, the Pixel 9A seems to ditch a prominent camera bump for a flat back. The videos also show the budget-friendly phone with a noticeable bezel bordering the slightly larger 6.3-inch display, along with an upgraded 5,100mAh battery.

Both videos include images and videos taken with the phone’s rumored 48-megapixel main camera, 13-megapixel ultrawide sensor, and 13-megapixel selfie camera, and they look pretty sharp. However, The Mobile Central notes that video quality takes a dip at night.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/final-destination-x-files-pitch-origins-2000576893'>Final Destination's Creators Look Back at Its X-Files Origins</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 17:10:53 <p>
Final Destination hit theaters 25 years ago today, spawning a franchise that’s still going with this spring’s Final Destination: Bloodlines. That original film stood out among the early 2000s teen-horror craze, providing gruesomely creative death scenes that spiral from the idea that the killer isn’t a masked slasher—it’s Death itself, chasing after people who dodged their intended moment of demise. In a new oral history, the series’ creators look back on the film’s origins, including more details about something that’s a well-known part of its history: its ties to The X-Files.

Speaking to Variety, writer Jeffrey Reddick recalled reading a magazine article about a woman who avoided a plane crash after a premonition told her not to fly—and how it sparked the idea about Death not taking kindly to being “cheated.” He thought of the perfect vehicle for such a story: The X-Files, which was then in its original run. “I wrote that idea as an X-Files [spec script] … so it was very serendipitous that we ended up having the film go to [The X-Files executive producers] James Wong and Glen Morgan, who were two of my favorite writers of all time,” Reddick said.

“The original story was very A Nightmare on Elm Street-influenced, where Death played with their survivor’s guilt or some secrets that they had to drive them to suicide, which was pretty dark,” Reddick added. His original script focused on adult characters, but when it was reworked for the movie, they were changed into high-school students—a studio request in the era of Scream‘s success.

Wong, who directed Final Destination and shares a screenplay credit with Reddick and Morgan, revealed a little bit about what Final Destination might have looked like in an X-Files context: “You would be concentrating on Mulder and Scully and how they react to [a series of deaths]—and they had to survive.”

However, Wong said, the story really was better-suited to a feature film. “As a movie, the main thing is that you had the time and the budget to make something spectacular that really drew the audience in and give them the surprises you want. In a TV show that’s almost impossible.”

Head to Variety to read the full piece, which has some fun reminiscences about Final Destination‘s filming, including crafting those creative death scenes, the (excellent) decision to change the original ending from hopeful to bleak—and how the film’s legacy lingers today.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

One of the best processors for outright gaming, AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, with its hefty stacked 3D V-Cache, has been the in-demand CPU for gaming since its initial launch in January and has been very hard to get hold of. AMD even stated that they were trying to get weekly rollouts of stock to retailers to cope with the demand, but that didn't stop the CPU from disappearing almost instantly from website pages when new stock came in. Prices for the 9800X3D skyrocketed, with third-party resellers trying to cash in on the demand for this processor and charging egregious prices. It's been two months, but finally, you can get hold of AMD's current-generation gaming king. Available for its $479 MSRP launch price, you can find the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D for sale at Amazon, Newegg, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. I don't see any discounts coming for this super-popular processor anytime soon, but it's great to see the price come back to normal now that there is availability. Here's hoping the same happens with graphics cards, but I'm not going to hold my breath. AMD's latest gaming king, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, uses AMD's successful 3D V-Cache technology, which provides the 9800X3D its pure gaming prowess. With an 8% performance gain on the previous generation 7800X3D, and easily outperforming the competition from Intel in gaming benchmarks. The 9800X3D is unlocked for overclocking and doesn't have excessive cooling requirements, making this processor one of the best CPUs for pure gaming.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

GoatWithAGun posted a defeated “Welp, we’re done here,” and shared a picture of their famous-for-15-minutes PC, which was described as “completely unresponsive” after the monitor seemingly lost signal from the machine. In the above post, which serves as both an obituary and epitaph for the deceased PC, GoatWithAGun sensitively told those gathered around this virtual deathbed “As of 2:14 PM Philippine Standard Time, my monitor lost signal from the PC and I returned to it completely unresponsive to any troubleshooting.” The Redditor graciously thanked those who had followed their fight to resuscitate the PC, and those who had donated. Actually, follow-up posts saw the Redditor start new threads at 48-hours+, and 100-hours+ before quiet darkness descended today. It may be unfortunate what has happened to this PC, which the Redditor said they decided to BIOS-flash due to the lure of BioStar stability fixes. Other components of this system like the AMD Ryzen 3 1200 CPU, 4GB of DDR4-2400 Kingston HyperX memory, an Asus GTX 1660 GPU, a 128GB Transcend SATA SSD, and a 480GB Crucial SATA SSD are all likely unconcerned with the motherboard’s sticky end. Before signing off, GoatWithAGun seemed to hint that they may soon have a new way to reanimate the dead BioStar A320MH motherboard. The Redditor said that a BIOS programmer is on the way (with a spare BIOS chip, we would hope). Thus, there may be a chance that this bricked single-BIOS device could rise again – if the BIOS contents are the only hurdle to it being able to boot. GoatWithAGun will probably announce the result of the BIOS programmer tinkering off of Reddit, due to a segment of the platform the Redditors says have “grown tired of me.” It’s a shame those folks couldn’t just go and read and comment on something else.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

How much could a possible folding iPhone cost? The phantom Apple smartphone with flexible display has been in the center of increasingly insistent rumors for a couple of years, with the concrete possibility that something can move from here to the next two years. It is therefore not surprising that the estimates are very salty. Taking into consideration the American list of Apple, it is almost double compared to the more expensive melafonino or iPhone 16 Pro Max which starts from 1199 dollars. With a parallel using Italian prices you could reach up to about 3000 euros, given that iPhone 16 Pro Max starts from us from 1489 euros. For a quick comparison, the popular Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 starts from 2099 euros. The price of 2300 dollars for the folding iPhone would also respect another preliminary evaluation, that of the famous Ming-Chi Kuo which had hypothesized a 2000-2500 dollar band, also pushing the base of the technical data sheet with an internal display of 7.8 inches and external to 5.5 ", dual rear camera, Touchid button for the release placed on one side and thickness from just 9-9.5 mm. All these rumors would imply a construction with booklet opening, while it is not yet clear if Apple can instead focus on a shell model.

Two NASA astronauts are finally going home after having spent more than nine months on board the International Space Station (ISS) for what was meant to be a week-long mission. NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission will depart from the ISS on Tuesday around 1:05 a.m. The crew includes NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, who journeyed to the ISS on board Boeing’s Starliner CST-100 spacecraft on June 5, 2024. Live coverage of the Dragon hatch closing will begin on Monday at 10:45 p.m. A live stream of Dragon’s undocking procedure will begin on Tuesday at 12:45 a.m. ET, and splashdown of the crew vehicle is expected around 5:57 p.m. NASA will resume live coverage of Dragon’s return at 4:45 p.m. Williams and Wilmore were assigned as the first crew to fly on board Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft. That meant that Crew-9, alongside Williams and Wilmore, would not be able to depart the ISS until Crew-10 is on the space station sometime in April. NASA ended up switching the SpaceX crew spacecraft, launching its Crew-10 mission on March 12 to bring the two Starliner astronauts back around two weeks earlier. Shortly after taking office, Trump claimed that he is working on a rescue mission for the two astronauts. Trump announced that he had asked SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk to “go get the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration,” he wrote on Truth Social. Organizing crew schedules in space can get complicated, and expensive, which is why the Starliner crew had to wait a little longer before they could hop onto a spacecraft headed toward Earth. All that said, we’ll be glad to see the two astronauts back home after an unexpectedly long time in space.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Lenses — what Snap calls the Spectacles’ various AR effects — can now utilize GPS data for simple navigation, multiplayer gaming, and other experiences. There’s also improved hand tracking, along with an AR keyboard that allows for text entry without pulling out a connected smartphone. Lenses can now use location data, including GPS, GNSS, and even compass headings. As part of today’s announcement, Snap shared demos of Lenses using the new capabilities, including Utopia Labs’ NavigatAR, which creates arrows pointing in the direction users should be headed en route to a specific destination. Another lens, Path Pioneer, allows developers to create AR walking courses with waypoints that guide users along a specific path, which could be useful for city walking tours or museums and art galleries. The Spectacles’ new AR keyboard features a “full and numeric layout” and takes advantage of refinements that Snap has made to hand tracking to improve targeting intent while reducing false positives while typing. There’s also a new grab gesture that can be used in Lens experiences, and hand tracking now knows when you’re holding your smartphone. Unfortunately, what Snap didn’t announce is a version of its AR Spectacles for general consumers.

So much so that Just Security, an online forum for political and legal analysis, managed to put a tracker online that "keeps trace of the legal actions against the actions of the Trump administration". On March 15, the date of the last update of the page, 126 procedures are underway - 2 of which closed -, divided into different categories: subsidies, loans and government assistance; Freedom and civil rights; Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility; Removal of information from government sites, and so on. The executive orders signed by Trump in the first months of his office certainly could not go unnoticed. It is no coincidence that it was precisely the Aclu who intended a federal cause against the American State Department, on behalf of seven complaints, due to a new policy that prohibits the "x" gender indicator on the documents of US identity, thus forcing people to have to indicate the sex assigned to them at birth rather than their gender identity. Finally, we could not fail to mention the numerous legal actions taken against the Doge (Department of Government Efficiency) and its boss, Elon Musk. The group of activists Public Citizen and several workers unions have sued the Office of Management and Budget (ORD) for having set up the doge under the president's executive office, claiming that allowing a private individual to access citizens' information is a violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act - a law that regulates the behavior of the Federal Consultative Committees. And this is only one of the dozens of causes that organizations, unions and private individuals have filed to contest the doge access to the personal and financial information of the Americans. In short, the Trump administration does not seem to go well at all. And if it is true that the president will go down in history for signing the greatest number of executive orders in the first months of his government, it is equally true that it could also be remembered for the number of legal actions that target it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Understanding where Elon Musk's private interests end and Donald Trump's political ones are increasingly difficult, since the two appear more and more aligned. True, Trump has always been a seller: over the years he has associated his name with practically anything, from casino properties, passing through steaks and, in recent times, also Meme Coin and Nft. At this moment on his online store it is possible to even buy pickleball rackets or branded fragrant candles. But Trump is above all a seller of himself. Why should he dilapidate all this political capital for Musk, the richest man in the world? Trump is not an altruist. Musk has paid almost 300 million dollars for the US elections of 2024, most of which in support of Trump's presidential campaign. It transformed X into a sorceress dystopia comparable only to Trump's social networks, Truth. And his work to the so -called Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) has allowed Trump to outsource the boring mechanisms of governance. Seeing Trump literally reading from a Tesla price list in front of the camera is the most plastic representation of a dynamic that will not end well.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In Germany, if the absence does not exceed three days it is not necessary to present a medical certificate. "If Tesla claims that many employees always take advantage of these three days and never reach the point of having to present a certificate, then this could be the starting point for the reasoning of the employer: I will go there and I will see if this person is really sick", continues the lawyer. “Even if you have to say it: a home visit like this is not very information for the employer. Furthermore, he has no right to know from me because I am actually ill and what is my diagnosis. So [the employer] can simply check if there is really someone at home. But even if it does not find anyone, this does not mean that someone is not sick: it could very well be from the doctor or sleep at home ". As told by the biographer Walter Isaacson, he often happens to vomit and twist for stress; And, competent as in the engineering - his true passion -, Musk personally supervises the projects with pressing questions that terrorize employees. However, despite the rumors about the infernal rhythms and the not really relaxing environment, Musk's companies continue to be attractive: having Tesla or Spacex in the curriculum throats to many, because it allows you to sprout higher wages once - and usually it happens after a few years - that the company is left. In recent days, Swedish Hedge Fund (speculative funds, Christer Gardell, said what many think: Tesla's actions could be quite outdated.

We may have just found an easy-to-swallow cure for one of the deadliest diseases out there. In research released this month, scientists report that a single dose of an experimental pill dramatically reduced the high fatality rate of Ebola infection, at least in nonhuman primates. Ebola is caused by several related strains of viruses (formally called orthoebolaviruses). The most commonly seen and deadliest version of Ebola is caused by the Zaire ebolavirus (named after where it was first discovered), which can have a fatality rate as high as 90% if untreated. But it can also spread between people through close contact with bodily fluids, including blood and semen. During 2014 to 2016, for instance, a Zaire ebolavirus outbreak in West Africa infected almost 30,000 people and killed more than 11,000. No outbreaks since have reached that level of destruction, but Ebola and related hemorrhagic viruses continue to be a grave public health threat in the countries where they’re natively found. Nowadays, there are effective approved vaccines and treatments for some species of Ebola. Earlier this January, the researchers also found that obeldesivir could protect monkeys from Marburg, another deadly cousin of Ebola (a recently ended outbreak of Marburg killed at least 10 people in Tanzania this year). More research will be needed to validate the drug’s potential against Ebola in humans, of course. But the researchers are hopeful that obeldesivir can become a broadly applied and more convenient weapon against these deadly infections. “For outbreak response, oral antivirals might present substantial advantages over now approved intravenous drugs, such as easy supply, storage, distribution, and administration,” they wrote in their paper.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

There are many curiosities that emerged during a chat between Alessandro Baricco and the Sergio Bonelli Editore team on the occasion of Milan Comics Week, the first edition of the Comics Festival by Feltrinelli bookstores. The author of the twentieth century, Abel and other masterpieces of Italian literature sat together with Tito Faraci, artistic curator of the Festival and screenwriter of many stories of the Bonelli house, Disney and beyond; Mauro Boselli, editorial curator and Tex screenwriter; And Maurizio Dotti, historical designer of many Bonellian stories. The tone of the conversation is immediately set by Tito Faraci and Alessandro Baricco, who exchange jokes in a code that will be well familiar to Tex's readers. Yes, Baricco and Faraci talk in jargon from Pard, partners, compendatives. Like Tex and Kit Carson, or Tiger Jack. Just to clarify the level of affection they share for the character and his world. But why do you love Tex, why would the most loyal readers all want to have it as a friend? Faraci asks for it, and Baricco replies: “Very difficult to say, because then on the Tex card he has a lot of characteristics that are not typical of my friends. "Tex is neither right nor left," says Boselli (and if he says, that he meant). And that being his friend is better than having it against him.

Model sizes were restricted to 16GB to offer a fairer comparison against Lunar Lake-powered laptops with 32GB of memory (the highest memory configuration available for these devices). An Asus ROG Flow Z13 64GB was used for the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 test system, and an Asus Zenbook S14 32GB was used for the Core Ultra 7 258V test system. In DeepSeek R1, the Ryzen chip was up to 2.1x faster (measured in tokens per second) than the Intel counterpart using Distill Qwen 1.5b, up to 2.2x faster using Distill Qwen 7b; up to 2.1x faster using Distill Llama 8b; and up to 2.2x faster using Distill Qwen 14b. In Phi 4 Mini Instruct 3.8b, the Ryzen chip was up to 2.1x faster than the Intel Lunar Lake chip; up to 2.2x faster in Phi 4 14b; and up to 2.1x faster in Llama 3.2 3b Instruct. AMD showed similar dominance in AI vision models using the same "time to the first token" benchmarking technique. This is all thanks to the Ryzen AI Max CPU's significantly more powerful integrated graphics chip (which rivals discrete graphics with its 40 RDNA 3.5 CUs), eight more CPU cores, and its significantly higher configurable TDP (rated up to 120W). Even though it consumes significantly more power than the Core Ultra 7 258V (which has a max turbo power of 37W), both chips operate in the same market, and are compatible in the same thin-and-light category of laptop PCs. It will be interesting to see how the new AMD mobile APUs shape up against Nvidia's RTX 50-series mobile GPUs, which are reportedly facing supply chain issues, delaying their launch in upcoming RTX 50 series gaming laptops. On a pure performance level (not considering form factor), these new Nvidia-powered systems will be AMD's primary competition. AMD is allegedly well on its way to handling discrete GPU competition, as it already advertised superior AI performance on the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 against Nvidia's RTX 4090 laptop GPU.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

But if your monitor is weak, it would make so much more sense to chip in a few extra bucks and head to Amazon to grab the limited-time deal on this 23.8-inch ASUS TUF Gaming Monitor for just $99. Over 8,000 notoriously picky Amazon reviewers have given the ASUS TUF Gaming Monitor an outstanding average rating of 4.6 stars, and most of those probably came from gamers who bought the monitor at its full price of $159. The ASUS TUF Gaming Monitor clocks in at a screaming-fast 165Hz, with support for 144Hz. ASUS’s Extreme Low Motion Blur allows the monitor to deliver a 1-microsecond response time, and with Adaptive sync to eliminate ghosting and other visual shortfalls. The ASUS TUF also deploys AMD’s FreeSync Premium technology to create the most fluid gameplay possible, especially for super-fast games like sports or intense third-person shooters like Helldivers II. Lesser monitors have so many little annoying pitfalls that you might not even notice until you play on an advanced pro-level monitor like the ASUS TUF. Choppy frame rates, or even something as simple as the dark areas being too dark and the light areas being blown out and overly bright, are hallmarks of an outdated monitor or one that’s nearing the end of its life. That $70 game will still be around in a couple of weeks. This incredible $99 deal on the ASUS TUF 23.8-inch gaming monitor, however, probably won’t be.

They’ll then be joined by Kitana (Adeline Rudolph) and Shao Kahn (Martyn Ford), who appearances were secret until today, as well as Johnny Cage (Karl Urban), who is apparently the key figure for the audience this time around. “[Johnny Cage’s] integration into the Mortal Kombat story and universe is a big part of what this movie explores,” Boon said. “He’s a washed-up Hollywood guy thrown into this magical, ultra-violent thing.

Ever wondered what would happen if you fell into a black hole? According to Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, you would be crushed by the powerful gravity of its singularity: the center of a black hole where all matter—and time—is compressed into an infinitely dense point where space and time break down. New research suggests that, instead of leading to cosmic oblivion, black hole singularities mark a beginning rather than an end. “It has long been a question as to whether quantum mechanics can change our understanding of black holes and give us insights into their true nature,” Steffen Gielen, study co-author and a researcher from the University of Sheffield’s School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, said in a university release. Gielen and his colleague Lucía Menéndez-Pidal, a mathematician from Complutense University of Madrid, investigated quantum mechanics within the context of a planar black hole—a simplified, two-dimensional model often used to test theoretical ideas. Rather than a black hole singularity, their approach indicates the existence of “strong quantum fluctuations,” which the release describes as “tiny, temporary changes in the energy of space.” Instead of space and time collapsing into nothingness, they are replaced by strong quantum fluctuations that may lead to a “transition” into a white hole. In a white hole, matter and time don’t end. As the theoretical opposite of a black hole, it could be where time starts. Let’s return to the original question: what would happen if you fell into a black hole? Either you’re crushed into nothingness, or—according to Gielen and Lucía Menéndez-Pidal—you might pull a Matthew McConaughey and pop out on the other side, Interstellar-style.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theverge.com/news/631214/biden-autopen-void-trump-claim-truth-social'>Trump says Biden pardons are ‘void’ because they were signed by autopen</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 16:19:05 <p>
In a post on Truth Social overnight, President Donald Trump claims that some pardons by President Joe Biden are “VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT,” saying an autopen was used to forge the former president’s signature. Trump alluded specifically to Biden’s pardons for members of the House January 6th Committee, claiming that the pardon signatures had been “done by Autopen” and that Biden “knew nothing about them.” He added that “the people that did may have committed a crime.” However, the president offered no evidence that Biden was unaware of the pardon or that an autopen — a robotic device that mechanically copies a signature — had been used. Trump’s post echoes claims made last week by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which alleged that Biden’s signature on several pardons was identical, implying the use of an autopen. The New York Post further claimed that a Biden aide “made unilateral determinations” to sign documents using an autopen. The idea that Biden was unaware of these pardons, however, is contradicted by his public statements about them. In a January 20th statement on pardoning January 6th Committee staff and others, Biden said that although he felt that the recipients would “ultimately be exonerated,” investigations of them could “irreparably damage” their reputations and finances. Before the Supreme Court issued its decision on presidential immunity, he told Time that depending on that decision, “Biden, I am sure, will be prosecuted for all of his crimes.” As an NPR story last year describes, Trump has said similar things about Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as Liz Cheney, who served as the vice chair of the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack. His new Truth Social post, similarly, claims “those on the Unselect Committee” are “subject to investigation at the highest level.” President Barack Obama signed a bill remotely with an autopen in 2011, pointing to a Bush White House legal team memo that said the president could sign something “by directing another to affix one’s name or seal to the document in one’s presence.” As Bloomberg notes, the Justice Department also held in 1929 that “neither the Constitution nor statute prescribed the method by which executive clemency shall be exercised or evidenced. It is wholly for the president to decide.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Warner Bros. Discovery has removed the entire lineup of classic Looney Tunes shorts (1930-1969) from its streaming service, Max. The company confirmed the move to Deadline, saying the streamer will prioritize adult and family programming, rather than content for kids.

This comes after Warner Bros. Discovery yanked hundreds of Looney Tunes episodes at the end of 2022, and later erroneously included the series in its list of titles leaving the platform. At the time, the company said Looney Tunes “will continue streaming on Max.” Newer Looney Tunes content, like Looney Tunes Cartoons released in 2020 and 2015’s New Looney Tunes, remains on Max.

Elon Musk, along with Republications, has vociferously attacked the rural broadband program launched under President Biden, called the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment Program (BEAD). Three years after launch, no internet expansion projects have begun with the program’s $42.5 billion in funding, though three states were awaiting final approvals just as President Trump took office. Musk has regularly used X to lambast the program, of course, while pushing his own Starlink service. Howard Lutnick, the new Commerce Secretary, has said the agency would review BEAD and remove burdensome requirements that have slowed down deployment as well as, crucially, eliminate any preference for fiber. Internet access, being just about as important as other basic necessities, is considered by many a utility today, but internet providers have not had much incentive to expand into rural areas that would be less profitable. Starlink can offer some impressive speeds in the range of hundreds of megabits, but typically not the 1 Gbps (1,000 megabits) or more offered by fiber optic, and latency is an issue given the limitations of sending signals to and from space. SpaceX may not need to lay cable, but must continuously launch new satellites into space as the old ones reach end-of-life, and the company is limited by regulators in how many it can place in orbit. Competition from Amazon and others is on the horizon, but has been slow-going. The satellite dish itself costs $349 (sans promotions), with service typically going for $120 per month. Feinman argues that while fiber might be more expensive to deploy upfront, households will be left with faster and more affordable internet service for years to come. Elon Musk himself said from the early days that Starlink would never replace fiber broadband for those who already have it, as the service inherently has limitations that ground-based infrastructure does not. The service is a good option for remote areas without access to fiber, and SpaceX has partnered with cruise and airline operators to offer internet in moving vehicles. The FAA is reportedly looking to cancel a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon in favor of Starlink. Unfortunately for those in rural America, it looks like they may soon be forced to pay more for less because Musk has been able to use X as his megaphone to push his agenda and intimidate any Republicans who do not go his way.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The demonstration experiment was conducted on February 14th at Rainbow Bridge, a long bridge on the Metropolitan Expressway. We have verified automatic flights of approximately 2.8km round trip using drones. This was carried out as a "Demonstration of video visibility confirmation during night flights" and "Demonstration of long-distance flights that use multiple drone ports that can automatically take off and land and charge drones, and redirect between ports." We confirmed the usefulness of inspection methods in the event of a disaster, using footage shot with a drone.

In addition to delivering stable footage in real time while flying autonomously over the highway at night, it also examined items such as broadcasting footage while flying under the elevated trains during the day and night, automatic takeoff, autonomous flight and automatic landing that travel from drone ports to and from different drone ports, flight information and video acquisition of simultaneously flying aircraft in real time, and centralized management.

In the demonstration of reciprocating between drone ports, communication was interrupted in some footage, but communication with the Global Positioning System (GPS) was relatively good and there were no interruptions. The video can be checked in real time, and the results were found to be sufficient to understand the road conditions even at night.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Formula 1's four-wheeled circus got underway this past weekend in Melbourne, Australia. Held on the roads around a lake in Albert Park, the track is one of F1's trickier challenges, made more so on Sunday thanks to rain that eased off before the start of the race, only to return with a vengeance a dozen or so laps before the end. It proved to be a tough day for four of the sport's six new drivers, as well as some more well-known names, and it gave us a clearer idea of the pecking order between the teams, at least for now.

True F1 junkies were probably following the preseason test earlier this month in Bahrain, as the sport now helpfully shows those three days of running on its streaming platform. But those devoted enough to watch the cars circulate for hours with nothing on the line also know you shouldn't read too much into a preseason test, especially one held at a circuit that is unrepresentative of most of the others that F1 visits—and in unseasonably cold weather, to boot.

Little has changed in the way of the technical regulations between the end of last year and the start of this one, other than an increasing scrutiny on the front and rear wings' ability to flex when they're not supposed to. Flexing or deflecting under load at opportune times reduces the drag and allows a car to go a little faster in a straight line for the same amount of power, giving that car an unfair advantage.

It looked as if McLaren would be starting the season off with the fastest car and that both Williams and Alpine tested well, but with no way to know how heavy or light any of the cars were running, it was less clear how to sort the field properly.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230590/'>Credit card "signing identity verification" will be abolished at the end of March - warning companies that PINs are required</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 15:41:00 <p>
In principle, "signing your identity verification" (PIN bypass) when making a credit card payment in-store will be abolished at the end of March. From April onwards, a PIN will be required for payments above a certain amount, so credit card companies are all warnings at once.

This change is based on the Credit Card Security Guidelines published by the Japan Credit Association (JCCA). With the aim of enhancing security, the previously possible identity verification using handwritten signatures will be abolished at the end of March, and a PIN will be required from April onwards. In addition, "PIN-less" transactions, such as "Trades less than 10,000 yen require no PIN code" will continue in the future.

In other words, you will need a PIN when using a credit card from now on. For users who have forgotten their PIN code, each company will provide instructions on how to request a PIN code.

According to the companies that provide payment terminals, users of overseas credit cards, such as visitors to Japan, who cannot verify their identity using a PIN, can continue to use signatures to verify their identity.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/the-physics-of-brewing-the-perfect-espresso/'>Physicists unlock another clue to brewing the perfect espresso</a></h2><b>Source:</b> arstechnica&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 15:30:46 <p>
Scientists from the University of Warsaw have gleaned insights into the underlying physics of channeling that will help coffee lovers achieve more consistent results when brewing espresso. They presented their preliminary findings at the American Physical Society's Global Physics Summit in Anaheim, California, this morning. As previously reported, there's an official industry standard for brewing espresso, courtesy of the Specialty Coffee Association, which sets out strict guidelines for its final volume (25–35 mL, or roughly 1 ounce) and preparation. But most coffee shops don't follow this closely, as the brewing machines allow baristas to configure water pressure, temperature, and other key variables to their liking. The result of all those variations in technique is a great deal of variability in quality and taste. For instance, in 2020, Christopher Hendon's lab at the University of Oregon helped devise a mathematical model for brewing the perfect cup of espresso over and over while minimizing waste. Hendon is a computational materials chemist, and his lab holds regular coffee hours for the Eugene campus community. That, in turn, depends on controlling water flow and pressure as the liquid percolates through the coffee grounds. Hendon et al. based their model on how lithium ions propagate through a battery's electrodes, akin to how caffeine molecules dissolve from coffee grounds. They concluded that the most reproducible thing you can do is use fewer coffee beans and opt for a coarser grind with a bit less water; brew time was largely irrelevant.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.wired.it/article/galassia-a-disco-sorprendentemente-grande-universo-primordiale-scoperta/'>Discovered a surprisingly large disco galaxy in the primordial universe</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 15:28:19 <p>
Until now, in fact, looking at the primordial universe, the JWST had detected much smaller galactic records than what we are used to observing in the local universe. The study has just been published in Nature Astronomy. "When and how galactic records are formed, it is still an enigma in modern astronomy - says Cantalupo - The first years of observations of the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a plethora of galactic records in the primordial universe, which corresponds to a cosmic era of eleven billion years ago, or two billion years after the Big Bang. Before our observation, however only much smaller galactic records were discovered by JWST by JWST than we see in the local universe. To investigate this theme, the authors and authors of the study analyzed a set of data collected by the JWST, relating to a region of the sky that is located 11-12 billion years light away from us and which is incorporated into a structure that will probably evolve into a storage of galaxies. It is a very particular region of the universe, characterized by a high concentration of galaxies, gas and black holes. After that the researchers analyzed morphology and characteristics, up to identifying a surprisingly large galaxy, which have decided to call "Big Wheel" (panoramic wheel), precisely for its enormous size. "Big Wheel is about three times larger than the previously discovered galaxies with star masses and similar cosmic times, and is also at least three times larger than the current cosmological simulations - continues Wang - It is instead comparable to the size of most of the massive records seen in the current universe". The rapid and early growth of this disco galaxy could have to deal with the particularly dense environment in which it is located, hypothesize the authors, even if further data will be used to confirm this possibility. "Exceptionally dense environments like the one that hosts the Big Wheel remain a relatively unexplored territory - concludes Cantalupo - further targeted observations are needed to build a statistical champion of giant records in the primordial universe and thus open a new window on the initial stages of galaxies' formation".</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theverge.com/news/631163/frida-baby-electric-nosefrida-pro-nasal-aspirator'>The Electric Nose Frida Pro relieves infant congestion with hospital-grade snot sucking</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 15:19:35 <p>
Frida Baby is upgrading a popular tool designed to help relieve an infant’s congestion with more power. The Verge’s Allison Johnson has already thoroughly explained why sucking snot out of a baby or toddler’s nose is as important a task as it is an unpleasant one. The NoseFrida SnotSucker comes highly recommended in parenting communities, but it’s a finicky device that requires a lot of manual suction and — more often than not — two adults to get the job done. The company already offers an easier-to-use electric version for $39.99, and other companies sell similar products. But Frida Baby says its new ENF Pro introduces two additional levels of suction power comparable to “hospital-grade neonatal aspirators.” A carrying case is included, and while the ENF Pro charges over USB-C, you’ll need to provide your own AC adapter. Frida Baby hasn’t shared details on how much suction that actually equates to, but Dr. Noze Best, a company that also sells a hospital-grade solution, says the suction strength of its NozeBot is 585 mmHg, while devices like breast pumps are closer to 270 mmHg. The Electric NoseFrida Pro includes two swappable tips designed for infants and older children. Friday Baby says the ENF Pro can run for up to two hours on its rechargeable battery but doesn’t specify if that’s at full power or using one of the lower options of its five variable suction settings. It charges using the included USB-C cable, but you’ll need to provide an AC adapter or some other source of USB power.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.wired.it/article/biancaneve-live-action-polemiche/'>All the controversies on Snow White Live-Action (even before the release)</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 15:16:29 <p>
Will they therefore be able to criticize and public to correct the route of a film that seems to be born under a bad star? The criticisms intensified after Zegler herself made several statements to the press in which she criticized the sexist system of the original fairy tale of the Grimm brothers and the animated film of 1937: "There is a great focus on her love story with a guy that clearly stalking them", said she, suggesting that the new Snow White would have had a role of greater action and self -determination, song like Someday My Prince Will how (my love a day will come). The actor Peter Dinklage, he himself a dwarf person, criticized this story in January 2022 he called "retrograde", especially for the childhood of Snow White's seven companions. In response to this, Disney had assured that he would do everything "to avoid reinforcing the stereotypes of the original animated, with a new approach and consulting members of the community". At one point some images had also circulated on the web, theoretically taken from the set, in which seven very different figures were seen that "reinterpreted" the seven dwarfs. In the end, it was confirmed that the seven dwarfs would have been recreated in computer graphics, similar to those of the original film, a move in turn highly criticized because it was considered a missed opportunity to write real dwarf interpreters instead. Gal Gadot, the actress chosen to interpret the bad queen Grimilde, is Israeli and in recent months it has been a very active voice in inviting governments to do more for the liberation of the hostages captured by Hamas on October 7th. For his part, however, Zegler called himself "pro-Palestina", reiterating his closeness to the Palestinian people in several posts. After Trump's victory he wrote, always on social media: "Trump and his supporters never know peace". Despite the apparently conflicting political ideas, Gadot and Zegler were seen together during the awards of the Oscars, even if on several occasions they promoted the film separate (however not unusual when you want to cover more places of promotion by dividing the cast).</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/netflix-orb-anime-review-madhouse-2000576670'>Orb Is Netflix’s Quintessential Thinking Man’s Anime</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 15:15:03 <p>
Thanks to generations of egghead astronomers putting their collective noggins together, we all share the collective knowledge about our solar system. While the particulars of how scientists arrived at that truth sound boring on paper, this Netflix show’s fictional take on the matter is worthy of being an early lock for anime of the year. Anyone who dares say otherwise is deemed a heretic by the Inquisition, put on probation after extra-judicial torture, and burned at the stake should their zealotry remain unchanged. At the start of Orb, we follow a young man named Rafal, who prides himself on his reasoning and capacity for not rocking the boat. That is until a chance encounter with a scholar-turned-heretic pulls him into believing in heliocentrism—that planetary thing we all casually believe now—jumpstarting the anime’s fatal generation-spanning game of cat and mouse between the church and astronomers about how the universe works. Orb is an anime that feels like a mix of The Da Vinci Code‘s thrilling mystery, Attack on Titan‘s enthralling political tug of war, and Vinland Saga‘s rich character writing while bringing something all its own to the table. Despite their motivations for inheriting the theory varying—with some seeking capitalistic gain from selling it for profit—they all sacrifice life and limb to develop the theory under church persecution and pass it on to the next generation. Orb could have easily rested on the laurels of saddling its drama as a clear-cut black-and-white affair with an evil church and an altruistic group of astronomers butting heads for twenty-five episodes. The overarching drama in Orb is not a case of Schrödinger’s depth, where planetary and monotheistic musings equate to a teenage atheist and an out-of-touch bible thumper clashing on social media. Although Orb‘s narrative framework is somewhat high-concept and heady to parse due to its dense, dialogue-heavy episodes, the anime excels by grounding itself as a compelling character study that celebrates the beauty of collective knowledge persevering through generations of persecution. To them, the rise of heliocentrism models is tantamount to saying there is something more ideal than the universe being centered on heaven and Earth. Meanwhile, Rafal and most of his fellow protagonists are driven by the desire to prove how perfect God’s universe is through the complex science and patterns of heliocentrism. The major outlier to the show’s central conflict is also its most unique element: its central villain, Nowak. In a single scene, Nowak transitions from a lackadaisical, carefree man to a ruthless mercenary willing to inflict extreme torture on men and children alike, to an extent that would make even the most radical inquisitor question their role in the cultural war. Orb is one of those anime where the action is both sparse and a violent exclamation point to the show’s intense verbal chess matches, double-crosses, and political subterfuge. The show’s capacity to conceive well-rounded characters throughout its numerous time skips, place them in the same room, and debate their ideals to perceived allies and enemies alike is more compelling than most fights in this year’s crop of anime.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Who needs friends when you can make your own using AI? That seems to be what maker and developer Pollux Labs has pulled off with their latest Raspberry Pi project. Using our favorite SBC and a little help from ChatGPT, Pollux Labs upgraded a rotary phone to interact with those who call using speech recognition and text to speech for responses. The phone doesn't work as a regular phone but rather is monitored entirely by a Raspberry Pi. However, it's up to you to call the AI program and engage with a futuristic experience that can only be accomplished with modern LLMs and a spark of ingenuity. So while you do retain much of the original experience using the handheld speaker and rotary dial, there's a huge element of modernity oozing out of the system. The project is driven by a Raspberry Pi 4B but you could get better performance using the latest Raspberry Pi 5. The software was put together by Pollux Labs just for this project and is primarily driven by a Python script that interacts with other services like the Whisper API from OpenAI to handle the ChatGPT interactions. It also maintains the conversation history and converts responses from ChatGPT into speech for the rotary phone to output.

It will begin offering from the 18th. SRE is a method that optimizes system operational costs and speed-up based on visualized numbers while maintaining system reliability. The new solution will support SRE practices in businesses through the introduction of observability. Specifically, by utilizing observability platforms such as "New Relic," we can visualize the actual operational situation in addition to information related to the system, such as operations from browsers and smartphones, networks, infrastructure, and applications, by visualizing the actual operation, not only analyzing system failures, but also effectively analyze and improve operations. Hitachi Solutions will select the most suitable tool that suits the company's challenges and budgets, and will step up the automation of system operations in stages. In addition to system performance, it also provides dashboards that allow you to monitor the actual operational situation and its improvement effect, as well as regular reports from the company's engineers. The company is said to be able to assist engineers in implementing the SRE process over a long period of time, helping them to penetrate the company. According to the company, SRE is widely adopted by US IT companies as a method to maintain system reliability and meet the speed of change required in modern IT. On the other hand, SREs have not yet been fully popular among Japanese companies, and the reasons for this include a shortage of internal engineers, difficulty in in-house production, and resistance to sudden changes in operation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On March 17, Sony Marketing and Hitachi Global Life Solutions (Hitachi GLS) announced that they will expand their joint logistics area in the domestic home appliance market. The Tokyo metropolitan area (Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba) and the Kansai area (Osaka, Kyoto, Shiga, Nara, Hyogo, Wakayama) areas will be added to the Hokkaido area, which has already been launched.

In addition to mutually utilizing on-site repair services in some regions in the after-sales service field, the two companies have continued to collaborate in the sales and customer service field, including selling Sony's TV "Bravia" at the local electronics store "Hitachi Chain Stole." In April 2024, logistics warehouses were integrated in the Hokkaido area and joint delivery began. Approximately 80% of the amount of items delivered to mass retailers are jointly delivered.

In the metropolitan area, a portion of Hitachi GLS's overseas production products that have arrived at Tokyo Port will be transported in containers to Sony Marketing's target delivery bases, and jointly delivered to mass retailer logistics centers. In the Kansai region, products that have been individually delivered from each base are delivered efficiently, such as collecting transport vehicles.

In the future, we are also considering implementing similar initiatives nationwide, and we aim to improve transportation efficiency, improve domestic logistics issues such as driver shortages, and reduce the environmental impact.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

is a senior editor and author of Notepad , who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years. Xbox 360 modders have discovered a new way to get homebrew apps and games running on the console. A new software-only exploit known as BadUpdate allows you to use a USB key to hack past Microsoft’s Hypervisor protections and run unsigned code and games. Modern Vintage Gamer has tested BadUpdate and found that you don’t even have to open up your Xbox 360 console to get it running. Unlike the RGH or JTAG exploits for the Xbox 360, this BadUpdate method just requires a USB key. If you have the time and patience to get this running successfully, you’ll be able to run the Xbox 360 homebrew store which includes games, apps, emulators, utilities, and even custom dashboards. Modern Vintage Gamer says the exploit isn’t always reliable either, or takes some time to pull off. As this exploits Microsoft’s custom Hypervisor on the Xb0x 360, you’ll also need to run this exploit every single time you boot up the console. You’ll just need a USB key, the exploit code, and a trial version of Rock Band Blitz that helps enable the bypass. Modern Vintage Gamer walks through all the steps in his detailed YouTube video, and there’s a brief guide on the GitHub repository that houses this software-only exploit.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

As Bleeping Computer reports, the researcher dealt with a decryptor tool for Akira after a friend asked him for help. The encryption key, in turn, is individually created for each file from four different time stamps with the accuracy of a nanosecond. This already results in one billion options per second. The researchers' time stamps may be used by evaluating log files from the system of his friend by evaluating log files. When it comes to estimate, his tool even takes into account different hardware profiles and encryption benchmarks. He finally tested how his tool works with the Cloud GPU service from Rundpod & Vast.ai. Specifically, sixteen Nvidia GPUs of the RTX 4090 Nvidia GPUs were used to uncover a decryption key within ten hours.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/looney-tunes-removed-max-streaming-warner-bros-2000576752'>Warner Bros. Has Pulled All of Classic Looney Tunes From Max</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 14:00:27 <p>
That’s all, folks–as parent company Warner Bros.’ valuation of animation continues to be in rapid descent, the company has decided that the same weekend the Looney Tunes light up the big screen in The Day the Earth Blew Up would be the perfect time to remove every original Looney Tunes short from its streamer, Max.

Deadline reports that the removal–which impacts almost 40 years’ worth of animated shorts from the 1930s all the way up to the late ’60s–is part of an ongoing reprioritization on Max to focus on adult and family content. While plenty of Looney Tunes series remain on the streamer for now such as The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, parts of New Looney Tunes, and Tiny Toons Looniversity, the franchise’s classic legacy of short form animation has been scrubbed entirely, coming even after Warner Bros. previously clarified plans not to remove the original shorts from Max in late 2023.

It’s not the first time in recent memory that Warner Bros. has come under fire for how it’s treating the studio’s animated legacy. At the end of September 2024, Warner Bros. confirmed that it would shutter its classic-animation-focused streaming platform Boomerang entirely, and came under fire when it completely scrubbed the beloved Cartoon Network website of years of history to replace it with a landing page directing people to subscribe to Max–cutting off generations of flash games as well as free online access to a host of episodes from contemporary and recent series.

But the move is also just the latest in an oddball relationship Warner Bros. has had with the Looney Tunes franchise in particular. The timing of Looney Tunes‘ animated origins being dropped from Max comes right as the franchise makes its long-overdue fully animated theatrical debut in The Day the Earth Blew Up–a release itself that Warner Bros. distanced itself from, first ordering the film for Max as a streaming original, and then selling the film to Ketchup Entertainment outside the American theater market for release after priorities shifted again. It also, of course, comes after the debacle that was Warner’s handling of live-action hybrid Coyote vs. Acme, shelved for a $70 million tax write-off amid reports that the studio allegedly obfuscated attempts to get the movie sold to other distributors.

Time will tell just how things between Warner and one of its most legendary animated franchises continue to develop, especially while Day the Earth Blew Up remains in theaters. After that brief bright spot, who knows what’s next after this?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/631082/trump-tariffs-iphone-altana-ceo-evan-smith-interview'>What Trump’s tariffs mean for the iPhone, China, and globalization</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 14:00:00 <p>
Today’s episode of Decoder is a little different, and I think it’s one of the more illuminating conversations I’ve had in a while. I’m talking to Evan Smith, the cofounder and CEO of Altana, a company that makes software to track and manage the global supply chain. Smith started Altana in 2019 because he predicted that the first wave of globalized manufacturing and free trade would come to an end, and companies would need powerful tools to adapt their supply chains as borders, tariffs, and tensions got more complicated. Here in 2025, that looks like it was a pretty good bet, even if the way it’s playing out is a little more stressful and chaotic than anyone really wants. The easiest way to think about Altana’s product is that it’s a map of the global supply chain — you’ll hear us call it that several times in this conversation. What that means is that Smith has a front-row seat to how things like Trump’s tariffs and isolationist trade policy are playing out in real time. So while we talked about Altana as a company a little bit, we really spent our time talking about where things like the iPhone are made and where they might be made in the future. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. You’ll also hear us talk a lot about China and how the Trump administration is focused on reducing our dependency on Chinese manufacturing — a goal that may or may not be possible on the kinds of timelines that matter to politicians, especially ones like Trump. Smith has a lot of insight here, and he’s very even-keeled about what Altana’s map of the world is showing us about trade policy and conflict between major powers like the United States and China. There are some big, unsettling ideas here, but talking about them directly and with clarity at least made me feel like I had a framework to understand the endless on-again, off-again tariff news cycle. You’ll hear us mention John Mearsheimer, who really was my international relations professor at the University of Chicago in the early 2000s. The other note is that you’ll hear us talking about China being granted membership in the World Trade Organization in 2001. You can certainly argue with that characterization, but it’s worth calling out because it was indeed a major, controversial decision at the time. There’s a lot in this one; I’m very eager to hear what you all think about it. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Evan Smith, you’re the co-founder and CEO of Altana. Altana builds software that helps people think about supply chains and logistics. I was reading the company’s manifesto, which you wrote in 2022. You founded the company in 2019 on the thesis that globalization as we knew it would break down and change, and Altana could build some software to help people in a new era of globalization. That bet seems very prescient right now — but also maybe a little bit destabilized, given how globalization might change. That breaks down into a few dimensions, principally around geopolitics. So it’s the US and China playing out a great power competition principally in the supply chain and economic theater. We can go back to that—the other one’s around climate. So you had this race to the bottom, where everything was outsourced to the lowest cost, just-in-time manufacturing locations, and the world’s physical production became dirtier and dirtier and dirtier. And I think we’ve seen that play out. The fourth thing we said was that these just-in-time supply chains are only economically efficient under conditions of stability. Because of reasons one through three, our point of view was that the world was getting a whole lot less stable. And I think that’s borne out since COVID. I remember Ross Perot saying that NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, would lead to a giant sucking sound of labor being moved to Mexico. It’s manufactured in several countries around the world, principally in China, but lots of parts flow back into China so Apple can make that product. But then you can look at the Tim Cook era, and you can say from one perspective, “He increased Apple’s stock price.” But from another perspective, you can look at it and say, “Oh, the iPhone has actually prevented the great power conflict,” right? If the Chinese government somehow makes it impossible for people to buy iPhones in China, that would be bad. If the US government makes it impossible for US customers to buy the iPhone, that would be bad, and both economies would crash. And that’s going to keep us from being in a war. When I was in college, John Mearsheimer wrote The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, which is a big book that predicted the United States and China would go to war, and the next day was September 11th, and then that whole thing got sent to the side. Now maybe we’re back to it, but I just look at all of that, and your thesis, which feels correct, like it’s being borne out, and I’m like, “Oh, this thing is actually being held together by some consumer products.” Making those consumer products and making our economies interdependent is the thing that keeps us from going to World War III. I got an economics degree from Yale in 2007, so at the absolute apex of the neoliberal and kind of neoconservative worldview, where… I literally went to school with Thomas Friedman’s daughter, and I read all of his books. His famous thing was the Golden Arches theory, right? Countries that have McDonald’s don’t go to war with each other, which was true then. So, the premise was that free trade and economic interdependence result in peace between nations. And as I’ve gotten older, I’ve kind of watched the world progress, studied more of history, and read some Mearsheimer, and I’ve actually kind of come to the exact opposite view — meaning peace gives rise to free trade and not the other way around. When there is an equilibrium in the whole global geopolitical great power competition, then what you see through history is that trade progresses between nations; and then in the moments of disequilibrium and big shifts in power, those become more violent. And so, my fear right now is that we’re in a disequilibrium. You have multipolarity with Russia and the EU asserting themselves in different ways, and the US, at least on a relative basis as a declining power, is no longer the single global hegemony. I see all this trade policy and volatility. So it’s all sort of nested within that big geopolitical circumstance. When you think about the thesis of Altana, in which you identified that globalization is running one version of its course, and there’s going to be a next version... I’m reading your manifesto. Again, I just go back to the iPhone. I’ve listened to every explanation from every Apple executive, from Steve Jobs on down, about why the iPhone can’t be built in the United States of America. I also think it’s possible to bring a lot more manufacturing into North America. You have that stratification of low-cost, relatively low-skilled labor going to higher-skilled, higher-cost labor, and you can manufacture most of everything that the United States consumes in our backyard, so to speak. Which might be again replaced by the annexation of Canada. Even that doesn’t seem like a stable foundation, but okay, continue. We’ll take it, but some people in the Trump administration published that data. So, theatrics aside, policy objective number one is that we want to bring industry back generally, and we want to rebuild a middle class. It’s an industrialization initiative, and they want to do that by creating trade barriers. The Biden administration had a similar objective, but they did that through very large-scale subsidies and industrial policy initiatives to direct capital toward those industries they wanted to see in America. The second thing is there’s a very clear objective, which he’s given to his policy team, to be strategically decoupled from China in critical industries by the end of his term. Critical industries — a kind of policy-speak for things that matter a lot, like food, telecom, aerospace, defense, and advanced electronics. The things that we couldn’t do without. He’s told his team that within four years, we need to bend the supply chain such that the United States no longer has these fundamental dependencies on China. Altana builds software that helps people see these supply chains. Describe how you build the software and what it does for your customers because I think understanding your viewpoint and your visibility into these supply chains will help me understand how you can see the shift from China in real time. At the base level, what we do is model the whole physical world of companies making things and buying and selling them from other companies. So it’s like a bottom-up, Google Maps-style view of all the companies — where they operate, what they make and sell, and the connections between them. In the same way that Facebook built a social graph that connects everybody within six degrees of Kevin Bacon, and LinkedIn is our professional relationship graph which shows how you’re connected to all your colleagues and counterparts… We’re doing the same thing but at the scale of the whole global supply chain network. And the way that our customers primarily use that is to understand and manage what are called value chains. We make it possible to know and manage that whole network for all the products in the world, and it sits on top of that map of the world that we’ve built. There was a deliberate move to outsource that whole value chain. The whole theory was that we should only do our comparative advantage. Western electronics companies keep seeing their stuff get into Russian weapons systems. Boeing doesn’t own its value chains anymore. Apple doesn’t even manufacture anything; they just create the software and the designs, and everybody else manufactures it. So what we’re doing at our core is we’re kind of making it possible to do what the industry used to do, which is to see and connect and have some control over that whole network. In our case, you don’t have to own the whole network. Why do these companies give you that data? They don’t share it in the broadest sense. None of those customers are sharing all their raw data with each other. We build out the network connections, and we train AI systems, and that all adds up to a model where every customer that joins adds to the visibility, connectivity, and intelligence for all the other parties. LL Bean tends to know not just the garment manufacturer it buys from and has a direct relationship with, it will also sometimes know the textile manufacturers that feed into those garment facilities. What it doesn’t know is everything upstream of that. It’s like, where does the cotton come from? One is ensuring that their goods are compliant and free of forced labor. The US banned all imports of goods into the United States that have any of that upstream value chain content coming from Shenzhen, China. So it’s a rebuttable presumption that the Uyghur forced labor issue was sort of infecting all those goods. You literally can’t import to the United States, and they’ve had detentions; everybody in the industries had detentions. And now they’re expanding that to look at all things sustainability in their value chain. So how do you use Altana to understand your carbon footprint? We become that sort of foundational network that they use to not just see the whole global value chain network but then engage it and make it better over time. I get it at the top level, right? A car company or a shipping company at the top level wants to see all this data, but then you need information from the lowest levels of that from the soil. Why does the big industrial producer in China want anyone to know where its products are coming from? I’m not sure they do in all cases, but what’s interesting is they now have to in more and more cases. The big arc of policy here, whether it’s tariffs, forced labor bans, or a carbon border adjustment in Europe… I can paint a big picture, but in the last two years alone, there have been 1,200 net new trade barriers added. That’s always been a little bit true in the context of moving goods across borders. That all is kind of business as usual. What’s so different over the last few years is they’ve created so many new and more stringent requirements on that whole upstream value chain, saying, “You have to share this information with us, you have to make these declarations, and it’s a matter of market access.” So your customers and your customers’ customers can’t get their goods into the biggest markets in the world without it. You’re also talking about adding AI to it. What kind of insights are you generating from collecting all this data? It seems like you have an enterprise data provisioning problem, but then you also, generally with AI, want to see all the data and collect an insight [from it]. It seems like there’s a tension between wanting to see the information across the whole network and actually generating insights. I mean, we spend a lot of money bringing all the data to us that we can get our hands on. And then, as I mentioned earlier, every customer that joins the platform is connecting their data to that model of the world, and then it’s subjecting their data to that whole framework of visibility and shared learning. So we’re now at the place where roughly half of all that supply chain connectivity, all the supply chain visibility, is coming from our customer network itself. That’s another way of saying that we’ve doubled what you can theoretically do by going out and scraping the internet, getting publicly available data, and licensing data from commercial vendors. So we’ve exhausted what you can do in the public domain, and we’ve now about doubled that, and the lead keeps compounding. We use AI to connect all that data together. You don’t have the benefit of unique IDs, like you do in personal data, where an email address or a telephone number can help you join all the records together, like Nilay or Evan. You need AI to process all that data and connect it into one clean, unified representation of the world. We’ve been building our own homegrown AI systems since day one to do that. Then, you need AI to map out those value chains. So that’s where we’ve invested really heavily over the last few years. We can almost instantaneously illuminate the inputs and outputs of anybody’s products across the whole global network with very, very high fidelity. So that’s always a jaw-dropping wow moment with customers, where it’s like, how could you possibly know this, and how could you possibly draw these connections? And then, on top of that foundation, we have AI systems that are doing everything from detecting single points of failure and business interruption risks. We can look at the whole network and say, “Here are upstream suppliers that are at risk of failing financially, just by sensing what’s happening in the supply chain.” That’s been one of our crazy success stories over the last year, just seeing the model perform on that. We have AI systems that automate all of the cross-border tariff and customs compliance work and all the logic associated with that. So that’s a $150 billion per year industry — just humans reading text about the nature of the goods and then assigning them the codes when they come across a border that say, “Here’s the tariffs and duties, and certificates, and permits.” So we have an agentic AI system that’s doing all of that. You can put the customer’s broker in the loop and give them ultimate control, but that’s become wildly performant. It’s AI to show the customers how they fit inside of the map, what are the networks that are relevant to them, and then also AI that generates insight and automates entire workflows. Let me ask the two Decoder questions, and then I want to put all this into practice with what’s happening in trade right now. This has evolved pretty meaningfully in the last few months. So, where I have little depth or relatively little depth, depending on the team around me, I try to speak last and ask questions, and then decide when I need to break ties or move the group forward. So I’ve actually leaned in pretty aggressively on product management and some big audacious product bets we’re making right now, and a lot of the network architecture we’re building to connect the public and private sectors into this whole global value chain network. We started the conversation where you’re like, “Hey, all these things seem to be coming true,” and that’s true. There’s demand for most of it right now. And so, the big scramble in Altana is like, how do we launch new software? I’m finding myself in wartime mode and calling a lot of shots to get through that stuff with velocity. You mentioned being able to detect when an upstream provider might be failing, right? You see the intent of a transaction before it occurs in real life through what are called booking requests and shipping instructions. So you see this life cycle of the supply chain activity. We also have real-time event feeds through a partnership with Dataminr, and we can overlay that on the whole map of the world and contextualize that for our customers. There are some things that you can see far ahead of the curve. Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, shows up on CNBC and says they’re going to go away. Do you see that reflected in the data? And this goes back years because the first Trump administration was the first to go hard with tariffs, and Biden continued it. So yeah, you do see a couple of things. You see a redistribution of imports associated with the tariffed goods from the tariffed countries, and then this is kind of obvious, but it’s either going to be manufactured locally, or it’s going to come from other places where the tariffs don’t apply. So what happened in Trump’s first term, when there was a bunch of Chinese economic policy and trade barriers that were put up, was you saw a big shift in Chinese supply chains going to Mexico and Canada, where two things happened. In one case, they would just do final assembly, so they’d ship all the refrigerator parts to Mexico, turn it into a refrigerator, and then import it into the United States under USMCA and not pay tariffs. The other version of it was through what’s called the e-commerce de minimis threshold, where the premise was like, if the goods are under $800, we don’t need to do a whole customs entry, pay tariffs, and put a trade compliance process in place. Let’s just rip it into the country and get consumers what they want. So then, unsurprisingly, you had these mega warehouses built up on the Mexican and Canadian borders, where they were drop-shipping items under $800, or even components that were sort of disassembled so that each of them was under $800 and then imported into the United States through that loophole. Both of those things are coming to an end, and it’s obviously a little chaotic, but I see the whole USMCA tariff thing through those lenses. And the other thing I should say is that it’s really interesting when you see the ownership networks because we map those too. You’re seeing all these Chinese companies open Mexican and Canadian subsidiaries to import goods from themselves and then bring them into the United States, subject to those exemptions I just spoke to. Is that what’s driving all of the posturing towards Canada and Mexico? Is it an underlying sense that China’s actually taking advantage of those agreements? That’s roughly 40 percent of Mexican and Canadian trade with the US. At the same time, they hit China with extra tariffs. The dotted line through all those things is that the Trump administration is trying to bring Mexico and Canada into tighter alignment with the United States and its trade policy vis-à-vis China. And all of that is to say, we want more manufacturing here in the North American continent and to get away from China. You’ve got a big map of the world. If you just look at where all the puzzle pieces are today, can you actually accomplish that in four years? You said that was the goal, and I don’t know how to take those Jenga blocks and make that tower. Some of the biggest chemical companies in the world have manufacturing locations in China that feed into all of our pharmaceuticals and advanced manufacturing processes. Is that kind of CapEx possible to replicate elsewhere within a four-year timeframe? There’s a lot of capital sloshing around the world. So, should the US government invest in that, and will it? I do think, philosophically, what this administration is saying is rather than the Biden approach of using mostly incentives and capital to build the things that we want here… So the IRA, the CHIPS Act... those deployed a lot of capital and loan guarantees and other ways to kind of subsidize and motivate the manufacturing of those things here. What this administration is doing is saying, “We’re going to use trade barriers to restrict the market access of competitive products,” and a lot of it’s aimed at China obviously, “and we’re going to let the market figure out the rest.” So we’re going to create the barriers. On what timeframe do you think capitalism figures that out? Again, I’m just looking at Altana’s product, right? What timeframe do you think that we can figure this out? I mean, a lot of these things are already in motion, so you’re just accelerating the near-shoring of advanced electronics. You’re accelerating the near-shoring of automotive supply chains. The pharmaceutical CEOs I’ve talked to in the last six months have already been talking about creating new manufacturing locations outside of China for all their key stuff. Some of these things are going to move a lot more quickly, and some of these things are going to be pretty tough. I think for those examples where you just have massive CapEx in China, it’s really hard. And I think the most intractable one, honestly, is what are called critical minerals. It is rare earths, which we all have heard of, and then the other metals that go into all of our most important electronics. And China has a virtual lock on all of the world’s critical mineral processing. They don’t have a lock on the raw material itself. These are typically big open pit mines where they’re doing cyanide leaching to separate these ores from other metals and refine them. So it’s stuff we don’t actually want in our backyard, which is all well and good if there’s a free trade environment. But in a world of geopolitical and economic competition, China now has between 60 percent and 98 percent of the world’s critical minerals on lockdown, and they use that market position now to kill any emergent refining in a country or a company that they don’t control. Well, you’re going to see, and this has happened repeatedly, China floods the market, depresses the price, and puts that company out of business. They either go away, or the Chinese company buys them. And so, the reason this really matters is that you can’t make missiles, airplanes, guns, telephones, or GPS [without these minerals]. So, can that be fixed in four years? When you describe that, I think about directed industrial policy, right? They made a huge trade-off against their environmental policy, the air quality that their people breathe and the labor abuses their workers might suffer, but they said, “It’s worth it, because over some timeframe we will have this stranglehold on the market and that will create peace, create prosperity,” some set of goals that industrial policy will deliver. On this show, we’ve talked a lot about TSMC and Taiwan’s massive investment in the chip industry because it saw the future and said, “We’re going to do that here. We’re going to make an industrial policy from the top down that says all the chips are going to be made in Taiwan. TSMC is our national champion; here we go.” We don’t have a directed industrial policy in the United States. You can see how that played out for them. But it doesn’t seem like that plan of, we have to actually say out loud, “We’re going to do nickel refining to decouple from China.” They haven’t said that out loud. They’ve said, “Here’s a bunch of structural impediments that might result in some capital directed at nickel refining in the United States.” So, why isn’t there nickel refining in the United States? There’s a reason we don’t want nickel refining. I think the Trump thesis here is, “Let’s remove the barriers to building, let’s create the barriers to what they view as unfair trade and economic abuses by adversaries. And you’re asking, is there a third way? In general, my perspective is that the United States can’t possibly out-centralize China. It can’t possibly out-execute top-down economic control better than China does. So create a rule of law and a risk capital environment, and a labor environment where the best ideas can win, people can take risks, and that can flush through the system — that has been our comparative advantage. I think the Biden kind of Freakonomics thing you described was very much like, “Okay, let’s sort of take other examples of central planning and industrial policy, and make these big billion, a hundred billion dollar, trillion dollar injections into sectors of the economy and specific recipients of aid, and then hope it works out.” I’m not so optimistic about that working for us. So I do think there’s a big question of, “Is there a third way, and what should the economic security policy framework of the United States be?” That’s a conversation I’m getting into more and more in the academic and think tank worlds. I don’t think we have a coherent answer to that as policymakers, and I don’t even think we have the language for it in a lot of cases. A lot of what you’re talking about with the comparative advantage of the United States historically being risk-taking innovation, I agree with that. Data-wise, we have not, until recently, had the United States government deciding that it will redefine how GDP is calculated. There’s sort of an essential policy and economic stability to how the United States works. Your company relies on some amount of stability in the system, right? Even to just look at a system and say, “We can see how things are moving,” implies that all the actors in the system are rational or predictable in some set of ways, or at least participating. We’re not going to do that anymore. Trump is going to say, “We’re going to cut our own lumber in the United States,” but all the trees are in Canada. We’re going to decouple from China in four years. Apple is going to announce $500 billion worth of investment that they already planned for, and somehow, that’s going to make it okay. All of that seems new and destabilizing in a way that, even in Trump’s first term, didn’t exist. I like these big systems problems, and I’ve seen, for a long time now, the gears of history cranking. It’s pretty obvious to me that the system I grew up in, and I think the orthodoxies of our time, have come to an end. The moment in time is one of instability and destabilization. I see these trends playing out almost irrespective of who’s in office here or there. Look at all the climate dislocation and the waves of immigration across borders that then result in nationalism and populism. And you kind of add all these mega-trends up. All these things, to me, signal a breakdown of the system. When you look at your map and you see China in the center of it, and almost all these value chains end up flowing through or around China, can that be reallocated? I mostly see it going there, at least for the more sensitive critical value chains. I don’t see it playing out any other way. And this isn’t just a sort of the US doing its thing. To some extent, how did we get here? We had a rules-based free trade order that the United States architected, and everything made a lot of sense economically, middle class impacts aside. And you had a very large and growing economy that was exploiting the free trade system systematically, stealing trillions of dollars of intellectual property to feed their industrial engine and subsidizing their exports at the expense of everybody else’s markets. And so, it was sort of bigger than its neighbor at an unprecedented scale, and I think the system is responding to that fact, right? It wasn’t that somebody here or there was elected and did some policy actions. So I view things in sort of this multi-decade lens, and the policy environment, the political environment right now is a consequence of that as opposed to the primary driver of it, if that makes sense. I wrote my law review article in law school on China’s use of open-source software to get itself into the WTO. And their approach to intellectual property was, “Oh, well, we’ll do copyright law,” because that is a foundation for open-source. The idea that we manufacture as many iPhones as we do with three nanometer TSMC chips in them is mind-boggling. There are many criticisms of Tim Cook one could issue, but… Did you maintain the rules-based world trade order for as long as you did because the iPhone is such a successful product, and you managed all of those supply chains? You managed both Trump’s first term and the Biden administration through COVID-19. That’s a remarkable fact of American industrial policy, right? Apple exists, and it held the world together for a minute. Do you think that there are still those kinds of products or those kinds of companies that will keep this thing going even as everything else gets destabilized? There has not been a great power conflict or a hot war between the United States and China in all this time. Even as things frayed, even as both sides felt taken advantage of or felt hostile towards each other, or sent fighter jets flying at each other for no reason, just to have a good time. I think we’re making it possible to be resilient and to navigate this change for both the public and private sectors. We also help them simulate policies and see how they might play out. And then we work with the private sector to navigate all that stuff. Then, I think you can envision a world where business in the West and business in the East continue to be transnational, and you have these miracles of productivity, and you have the economic ties that bind. And I’ve been in a war game with US military leadership, where one of their assumptions is that GPS goes off, and all of the critical water and electricity facilities in America are shut down. And those are all through supply chain exploits that have been built into the systems by China over the last two decades and known vulnerabilities, known state-sponsored cyber attacks that create those exploits... I think there’s a higher probability that escalation occurs and tensions fray. I feel like some people will take issue with your characterization of Taiwan as an island, but I get it. This is the biggest question that I have for you. I don’t know if there’s enough capacity. I am not saying all of it has been industrialized. But it does seem like with the past 25 years of globalization and maybe the next wave of globalization that you’re helping bring about, it has reached an equilibrium. And destabilizing that equilibrium just implies there will be more capacity, that we’re going to move the chips out of Taiwan and make them in India or something. I’m not sure that there’s enough capacity to reorient everything and maintain an equilibrium or to change it without something even more destabilizing happening. I think there’s enormous production capacity at basically every stage of the value chain. So I don’t think there’s any kind of fundamental limit that we’re bumping up against, either in terms of labor price, labor skill, raw material availability, or manufacturing sophistication. So I think there’s an enormous amount of capital out there chasing good returns, and there’s an enormous wave of productivity gains that are already underway, and it’s going to keep scaling with AI and robotics. Based on your map, what seems the most stable right now? So, tariffs notwithstanding, if I were starting from scratch and not doing Altana, the thing I’d be most excited about is building a software-enabled and AI-driven manufacturing value chain for advanced electronics in North America. I’d be focused on producing in Mexico, sourcing most of my components from North America, serving US and Canadian markets, and taking advantage of the free trade agreement that exists. As you know, North American origin got hit with tariffs, but everything that’s certified is still sort of free trade. I would go long on the Mexican demographics. I would go long on the Mexican economy, generally. And I would try to build a Shenzhen of North America. One big, integrated, and co-located value chain where you could really do mass-scale drone manufacturing, optics, the whole thing. The Chinese government also made a huge investment in labor, right? When Obama asked Steve Jobs, “Why can’t you make the iPhone here?” His answer was, “There’s just not enough manufacturing engineers. Do you see that labor pool existing in the United States, Canada, or Mexico? Is the Mexican government going to be better at that than we are? So, there is a massive gap in both of those worldviews and approaches. I obviously could talk to you for another hour. I want to know more about your law school thesis. I think China’s doing the same thing with open source and AI that they did with open source back then. But anyway, maybe that’s for another one. Thank you for being the only person, including the editor of the Wisconsin International Law Journal, who has ever said, “I want to know more about this thesis.” I appreciate you for that. It was a good suck up to end the show. When tariffs go on, we won’t have you. When tariffs go off, we’ll have you. So, every few weeks, we’ll have you back on the show. All right, I’m going to be a regular. Decoder with Nilay Patel A podcast from The Verge about big ideas and other problems.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/mechanical-keyboards/keydous-nj98-cp-v2-he-review'>Keydous NJ98-CP V2 HE Review: Dedicated calculators</a></h2><b>Source:</b> tomshardware&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 14:00:00 <p>
The mechanical keyboard market has been flooded with pre-built keyboards featuring magnetic switches over the past year — it seems like a new 75-percent magnetic switch keyboard boasting Rapid Trigger and Snap Tap comes out every week. But because magnetic switches are largely aimed at gamers, we haven't seen a lot of magnetic switch gaming keyboards that are larger than 75-percent. We've seen some — like Glorious' wildly-expensive custom-built GMMK 3 series. And now, the Keydous NJ98-CP V2 HE, which is a much more budget-friendly option. It's wireless and features a hot-swappable PCB that accepts both magnetic switches and mechanical switches, which is handy considering the lack of standardization in the magnetic switch market at the moment — you can always fall back on your favorite mechanical switches. The keyboard also features a volume knob (programmable) in the upper right corner, which is next to a detachable magnetic docking screen. This screen also acts as a screen for the keyboard's built-in calculator function, which you can access by hitting Fn + Numpad Enter. Also, the dedicated calculator key, which opens up your PC's onscreen calculator, seems like overkill in addition to this feature (how many calculators do you need?! The screen is easily removable — it just pulls off, though the magnet is strong enough that you shouldn't have to worry about accidentally knocking it loose. I'm not sure why the screen is removable, as it doesn't work on its own, but Keydous does sell replacement screens in different colors (light pink, light green, and khaki) on its website for $20, so I suppose it's just another way to customize your build. The keyboard is housed in a plastic chassis with a slightly textured matte finish, which is not the fanciest-looking (or feeling) chassis material. You can get this keyboard with either an aluminum or a brass positioning plate (brass costs $15 more); our review unit with its aluminum plate weighed in at 2.52 pounds (1,144g) — solid, but not particularly heavy. This is a nice feature, as a lot of the magnetic switch keyboards we've been looking at recently have had aluminum cases and no angle adjustment. Finally, there's a little slot for the keyboard's 2.4GHz wireless USB-A dongle, which is small and unassuming (a little too unassuming — there's no label on the USB dongle at all, and I immediately forgot what it belonged to). Swipe to scroll horizontally Size 96-percent Number of keys 98 Switches Kailh Ice Cream Magnetic Switch V2 (linear) Backlighting Yes Onboard Storage Yes Dedicated Media Keys Yes Game Mode Yes Additional Ports 0 Connectivity 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired (USB-C) Cable USB-A to USB-C Keycaps Dye-sub PBT Construction Plastic chassis Anodized aluminum top plate Software Keydous Driver Dimensions (LxWxH) 15.87 x 5.43 x 1.57 inches / 403 x 138 x 40 mm Weight 2.52lbs / 1,144g MSRP / Price at Time of Review $149.99 It comes with Kailh Ice Cream Magnetic Switch V2 switches, which are linear magnetic switches with an initial force of 30gf and a total travel of 4mm. The case comes with three layers of foam inside, which do a very good job of dampening sound and absorbing any case ping. The space bar has a deeper, somewhat out-of-place "thock" to it, which is noticeable but not so much so that it's overly distracting. The Cherry keycap profile is relatively low-profile with sculpted rows, for a comfortable, easy-travel typing experience. These keycaps have slightly curved tops and a lightly-textured finish that's just slippery enough for speedy typing — I was able to consistently hit around 130 wpm with 99% accuracy on this keyboard right out of the box. For productivity, this keyboard's built-in calculator does seem to be pretty handy. I suppose maybe that's why there's also a dedicated calculator button on this keyboard — in case you need to enter in your numbers on your computer. But, of course, this is a keyboard — how often are you not going to be using your computer when you're using this calculator? While I did think this feature was pretty neat at first, I now think you probably don't really need it alongside a dedicated calculator button. But maybe there's some use case I'm not considering. It has a solid, 1,000 Hz polling rate over both its 2.4GHz wireless connection and its wired connection, and game mode (Fn + Windows Key) is built in. It also offers adjustable actuation, which lets you adjust the point at which the key actuates (individually for each key, if you like), as well as Rapid Trigger, which matches the key's actuation point to its de-actuation point, so you can press it down as soon as you let go of it, without having to wait for it to pass a specific de-actuation point. Cherry profile keycaps and linear magnetic switches make it easy to quickly glide across the keyboard, but the keyboard itself is perhaps a little too big for most gamers. It is pretty clearly translated from Chinese, and all the documentation is also translated from Chinese, which makes it a little confusing and convoluted at times. You can turn on and adjust the keyboard's magnetic switch settings — actuation point, Rapid Trigger, Dynamic Keystrokes, Toggle Keys, Snap Tap, etc. You can also customize the screen with your own pictures or animations. The software is actually pretty impressive here, if perhaps a little unnecessarily detailed — you can upload your own images or gifs, or you can draw things on the "draw board" and save them to the hardware — and your drawings can have colors and multiple frames. I didn't spend too much time exploring this, but it is kind of neat if you love customization. You can also upload and share your presets — whether they're keymaps, drawings, or lighting effects — with others in the Keydous Driver community. The NJ98-CP V2 offers three forms of connectivity: low-latency 2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired via USB-C. It offers a solid 1,000 Hz polling rate over both 2.4GHz wireless and wired connections, which is the standard for gaming keyboards — though we've recently seen a few magnetic switch keyboards with ultra-high polling rates (such as the Luminkey Magger 68 HE and the Lemokey L5 HE 8K ). There really aren't very many full-size magnetic switch gaming keyboards on the market — and this technically isn't even full-size, either. So if you're the kind of person who needs a numberpad or just a lot of extra keys, your options are pretty limited.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.wired.it/article/sciopero-dei-treni-del-19-marzo-ecco-chi-si-ferma/'>Trains strike of March 19th, that's who stops</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 13:59:57 <p>
The trains of the trains of 18 and 19 March 24 hours was revoked, but to remain standing is 8 hours. Here are who strikes and who does not.

The possible inconveniences

From 9.01 to 16.59 on Wednesday 19 March 2025, trains will be able to undergo cancellations or variations, for a national strike of the staff of the FS group, Trenitalia, Trenitalia Tper and Trenord.

Initially, the mobilization should have lasted 24 hours, from 9pm on Tuesday 18 to 21 on Wednesday 19 March. However, USB private work has revoked the protest, announcing that he intends to promise it in the coming months. Instead, the eight-hour stop proclaimed by Ugl Ferrovieri, Fast-Confsal and Orsa Ferrovie, from 9 to 17 on Wednesday 19 March, with possible repercussions on rail connections from all over Italy, remains confirmed.

Guaranteed trains

Regional trains will be guaranteed in the guarantee bands from 6 to 9 and from 18 to 21.

As regards long journeys, it is possible to consult the guaranteed trains directly from the official website.

How to request a refund

For all passengers who intend to give up the trip, it is possible to ask for a refund starting from the declaration of strike until the time of the start of the booked train, only for Intercity and Arrows and until 24.00 on the day before the strike for regional trains.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Thermal expansion is also favored by the absorption of heat by the deep ocean, a growing phenomenon, reports NASA. To all this are added events such as El Niño, which redistributes large masses of hot water in the central and eastern Pacific, contributing to the vertical transfer of heat to the ocean. The risks of increasingly high seas The satellite data of NASA certify that the annual rate of raising the sea level has grown by more than double since 1993, adding 10 cm in total. The Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organization Celeste Saul has warned that "due to the flowing of sea level, the ocean is going from being a friend of all time to a growing threat". A NASA study published in September provides that the sea level in the Pacific islands will increase by at least 15 cm in the next three decades. Raising is defined as irreversible and "will occur independently of the fact that greenhouse gas emissions change in the coming years". Research indicates that the well -being and safety of insular nations are also threatened. This can lead to social disorders, displaces and migrations, as well as disagreement on maritime boundaries and ocean resources".

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://gizmodo.com/magas-tesla-embrace-means-ev-politics-will-never-be-the-same-again-2000576747'>MAGA’s Tesla Embrace Means EV Politics Will Never Be the Same Again</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 13:35:56 <p>
President Donald Trump, the same man who once said that people promoting electric vehicles should “ROT IN HELL,” bought his own EV this week. Tesla has lost more than half of its value since December as sales have plummeted worldwide. Liberal Tesla drivers have slapped stickers on their cars that read “I bought this before Elon went crazy.” Here were the two biggest characters in MAGA politics promoting a technology that’s been largely rejected by their right-wing base. Other prominent Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, quickly moved to defend Tesla against vandalism that Trump is labeling “domestic terrorism.” Tesla’s sudden shift from Democratic status symbol to Republican icon has some thinking the controversy around Musk could lead to a bipartisan embrace of EVs. “He’s uniquely positioned to and has the power to really shape this debate and help bridge the divide here,” said Joe Sacks, executive director of the American EV Jobs Alliance, a nonprofit trying to prevent “silly partisan politics” from stopping a manufacturing boom for electric vehicles. According to polling the alliance conducted after the November election, Republicans have warmed up to Musk, with 82 percent of those polled saying that Musk is a good ambassador for EVs. They are typically tradition-minded people who like big cars, not small cars with new technology they’ve never used before, said Marc Hetherington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and co-author of the book Prius Or Pickup? “Conservatives don’t have the sensibility that fits with electric vehicles at all,” he said. “So I don’t think that you’re going to see a spike in Tesla sales among conservatives.” “I think Elon made a bet that I think he’s secretly regretting, that Republicans would come out of the woodwork and say, ‘Yes, we’re going to support you,’” Edwards said. If they came around to any electric vehicle, however, it might be a Tesla. One of the primary things Republicans care about when it comes to buying a car is that it looks fast and goes fast, and Tesla has seen more Republican buyers for that reason, Edwards said. “Tesla was able to finally give Democratic buyers what they were looking for — a Prius-like image of being thoughtful, combined with the fun and excitement of a real luxury sports car,” Edwards said. That started to change as Musk became a magnet for political controversy, starting with his takeover of Twitter in 2022. Of course, there are ways to depolarize electric vehicles that don’t rely on cues from Trump or Musk. Sacks recommends talking about the attributes of electric vehicles: their ability to accelerate faster and brake more crisply, as well as help people save money for every mile they drive, since there’s no need to buy gas. When people have friends or family who own an EV, that also helps break down the cultural divide, he said. In a way, you could see Trump becoming a salesman for electric vehicles as an example of that very phenomenon, with his self-described “first buddy” convincing him to come around. Just two years ago, Trump complained that EVs needed a charge every 15 minutes and would kill American jobs. But, after Musk endorsed his presidential campaign last summer and donated $288 million, Trump softened his tone, saying that he was in favor of “a very small slice” of cars being electric. “I have to be, you know,” Trump said, “because Elon endorsed me very strongly.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Alphabet is spinning out laser-based Internet company Taara from its “moonshot” incubator, hoping to turbocharge the start-up that provides high-bandwidth services to hard-to-reach areas in competition with Elon Musk’s Starlink network of satellites. Taara is the latest project to spring from X—Alphabet’s experimental hub that produced AI lab Google Brain and Waymo’s self-driving cars—and has its origins in a concept called Loon. However, its lasers found a second life on Taara’s towers under engineer Mahesh Krishnaswamy. The technology works by firing a beam of light the width of a pencil from one traffic light-sized terminal to another, using a system of sensors, optics, and mirrors to fix it on a 1.5 inch receiver. Alphabet says the system can transmit data at 20 gigabits per second over 20 km, extending traditional fibre-optics networks with minimal construction and lower costs. Based in Sunnyvale near Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California, Taara has two dozen staff and is hiring aggressively. The start-up has secured backing from Series X Capital, and Alphabet will retain a minority stake, but the company refused to disclose any details about its seed funding or financial targets. “We’ve realized over time that for a good number of the things we create, there’s a lot of benefit to landing just outside of the Alphabet membrane,” said Eric “Astro” Teller, X’s captain of moonshots. Taara already operates in 12 countries including India and parts of Africa. It also supplements overloaded mobile phone networks at events such as the Coachella music festival in California.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

One of the things that Nvidia does not exactly encourage its partners among add-in-board (AIB) manufacturers to do is to 'factory overclock' memory on graphics cards featuring its GPUs. However, it looks like MSI's Alexei 'Unwinder' has managed to unlock this possibility for GDDR7 memory on GeForce RTX 50-series products, as noticed by VideoCardz. A new unofficial update for MSI Afterburner enables RTX 50-series GPU owners to push their memory overclocking limits by an additional 3 GT/s, achieving data transfer rates of up to 36 GT/s. While some may say that a mere 10% overclock — especially in the case of the GeForce RTX 5090 that has a wide memory interface and barely needs that extra bandwidth — is not a big deal, this is not as simple as it sounds. GDDR7 memory ICs available today from Micron, Samsung, and SK hynix are rated for an up to 28 GT/s — 32 GT/s (Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung have GDDR7, but the latter does not disclose its specs). Nvidia recommends reducing data transfer rates to 28 GT/s (except for RTX 5080, which is set to 30 GT/s), though the chips can handle higher speeds, which is where Unwinder's achievement represents a breakthrough as it 'unlocks' available capabilities of the memory chips. The new update involves replacing a specific database file and is compatible only with MSI Afterburner version 4.6.6 Beta 5 Build 16555. Some users have instead turned to GPU Tweak III, Asus's software, which supports both AMD and Nvidia GPUs and avoids known bugs present in MSI Afterburner. Ultimately, both MSI Afterburner and GPU Tweak III can now support GDDR7 memory overclocking on GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards. With the modified database, pushing speeds beyond 32 GT/s should now be achievable without issues.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A hot potato: Google recently expanded availability of its Gemini 2.0 Flash model to more developers, and it didn't take long for folks to unearth its new capabilities. Social media is abuzz with Gemini 2.0 Flash's ability to remove watermarks from licensed work, a practice that is deemed illegal by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Such images litter stock photography services although in many cases, an identifying logo, text, or pattern is used to discourage unauthorized use. Eventually, programs and online services emerged that automated the process although results could vary wildly. New skill unlocked: Gemini 2 Flash model is really awesome at removing watermarks in images! Early examples of Gemini 2.0 Flash's capabilities shared online, however, are among the most impressive we have seen to date from an automated service. Not every instance is flawless, but many are very passable. Some are now wondering if they are too good, and if Google will end up removing the feature over fear that it might attract a lawsuit from a major player like Getty Images, which recently purchased rival stock media provider Shutterstock for $3.7 billion. For example, OpenAI's GPT-4o and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet will flat out refuse to remove certain watermarks from images when asked. One would think that designation would give Google time to make any necessary changes without facing too much trouble in court.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Amber Midthunder isn’t sure if she’ll return to the Predator franchise any time soon. Sarah Michelle Gellar discusses how quickly the Buffy revival is coming together. Plus, get another new look at The Toxic Avenger, and try not to be too surprised: Jonathan Frakes teases that there’s going to be a starship in Star Trek: Starfleet Academy. During a recent interview with Omelete (via Screen Rant), Joe Russo described Doomsday and Infinity War as “a new beginning” for the MCU. The greatest thing that ever happened is we got to, you know, get immersed in you know a 20 movie arc and and see an ending to that arc. What’s compelling about these two new Avengers movies is they’re a beginning. And then who knows where we’ll go from there. Maybe it’ll be another 5 years but I think we just needed that time and perspective to figure out where it needed to go next, and the only thing that brought us back was the right story. We can’t explain that as it’s part of the story. Meanwhile, Amber Midthunder told Collider she “doesn’t know” if Naru will ever return to the Predator franchise following Prey. He obviously has Badlands coming out this year, so I’m really excited to see that. Whatever Dan does, I will always be his fan. Fangoria has a new poster for the upcoming Toxic Avenger remake, finally seeing release this August. Deadline also reports a TV series based on Philip K. Dick’s The Variable Man is now in development from Humans creators, Jonathan Brackley and Sam Vincent. The “grounded sci-fi project” is said to concern “a cold war during which sides calculate their chances of winning with advanced tech.” During a recent appearance at this year’s Indiana Comic Convention (via Screen Rant), Jonathan Frakes stated Starfleet Academy is aimed at “hardcore Star Trek fans” and boasts “the most massive set of any Star Trek” series, “ever.” But it has the most massive set of any Star Trek ever. I have been known—I’ve had a bad experience with oversharing, and I hope that wasn’t an overshare, but it’s fabulous. Meanwhile, Sarah Michelle Gellar told People the new Buffy series is “progressing probably faster” than she’d originally anticipated. We’ve set up our offices, which means things are progressing probably faster than I’d anticipated. But it’s going to be a process, I think.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. The picture above does not contain two different gaming handhelds. Instead, this halo device for Qualcomm’s just-announced Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 gaming chips — which I’ll tell you about in a sec — is a single transforming device with swing out gamepads and screens. Hold it horizontally like a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, flip out its secondary screen, then rotate its twin hinged gamepads for a more squared-off Nintendo DS-like experience: Me, I’m busy imagining the satisfying and/or horrifying sounds it might make as its triple joints swing into action! Before you get your hopes up, the OneXPlayer OneXSugar is unlikely to become a machine aimed at Windows games too. For one thing, we’re looking at nice but modest gains of 30 percent more CPU performance and 28 percent more GPU performance than the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 announced in 2023. It doesn’t contain the Oryon CPU core that powers both Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite for phones or its Snapdragon X Elite for laptops, nor the Adreno X1 or Adreno 830 GPUs that respectively feature in those chips. And while Qualcomm Snapdragon gaming lead Micah Knapp told journalists that the company might launch support for other operating systems “over time,” it’s “really focused on the Android side” as of today. That’s because China is such a huge market for Android gaming, the company hints. That China interest is certainly helping produce some incredible looking devices. When Qualcomm first announced its last handheld gaming chips, the best it could show off was a dull batarang-shaped reference design. Knapp tells me that his company doesn’t need to subsidize the development of Qualcomm handhelds, either. “People have accepted this is where things are going to happen, and now they’re just aggressively moving into the space,” he says.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Facing questions about RDNA 4 supply, AMD Japan's Marketing Manager Yoshiaki Sato claimed (machine translation) that Radeon has boosted its market share in the country to 45% with RDNA 4, the highest it's ever been. Of course, this generation, retailers are interpreting the 'suggested' part in MSRP quite literally. The session was joined by popular influencers who praised AMD's Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs for low temperatures but also expressed a desire for more I/O on the motherboards. Afterward, Ms. Saki Suzuki and Mr. Sato from AMD gathered at a roundtable, side-by-side with board representatives from ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, PowerColor and Sapphire. This was later followed up by an important statistic, with Mr. Sato reporting a 45% retail market share for Radeon GPUs. "We're the opposition party, so let's aim for 70%," said Mr. Sato, though such high ambitions require a reliable and steady supply chain. These comments are recorded in this video, starting from four hours, seven and a half minutes. We presume it refers to the share of Radeon GPUs sold in Japan since earlier this month, when RDNA 4 hit shelves. If AMD manages to offer RDNA 4 at MSRP, whether it be by ramping up production or offering rebates, we could probably see this number tick up. At least that's what AMD hoped to achieve this generation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"Most prefectures have a system in place for public high school entrance exams in a single application system, meaning that one student can only apply to one public high school, but there is a major problem from the perspective of fairness." The person who raised this issue was former Digital Minister Kono Taro. "Under a single-person system, students who are worried about their family's financial strength will have no choice if they fail to try a difficult school, but have no choice but to attend a private school, which creates unfair and inefficient situations, such as students who are forced to take a safe place or who do not attend cram schools fail to get enough information about their exams and fail to accurately grasp what level they will pass," says Kono. "A system called the acceptance hold algorithm (DA) method, which is currently proposed by Kojima Takehito, Noda Toshiya, and Keio University's Nakamuro Makiko, should be introduced in public high school entrance exams." With this algorithm, students submit a list of schools they want to attend, starting from their first choice. The algorithm has a proven track record in public high school entrance exams in New York, and is said to be a theoretically excellent method. Kono also said, "There is almost no cost other than system development, and it can be easily implemented thanks to advances in digitalization." Toyama Prefecture Governor Nitta Hachiro also posted a post from Mr. Kono. "I also wanted to introduce a multiple application system for prefectural high schools, but I found the algorithms implemented in the United States to be extremely complicated and thought it would be difficult in one prefecture. I would be grateful if the Digital Agency could work on it," he sent a positive message.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

EU tech leaders want to move away from relying on foreign-owned infrastructure EU companies want common standards and less red tape Several major European tech companies are pushing for greater action from the European Union to reduce the bloc’s reliance on foreign-owned infrastructure by buying and building locally. In an open letter to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the EU’s digital chief, Henna Virkkunen, around 100 organizations called for greater adoption of EU-grown apps, platforms, AI models, chips, computing, storage, and connectivity. Companies such as Airbus, Element, OVHCloud, Murena, Nextcloud, and Proton have all put their mark on moving towards EU digital sovereignty. A paper [PDF] published in January 2025 by a number of prominent business heads and tech experts has given some foresight to how a “Euro stack” would work: “The objective is to reduce Europe’s current total dependency on non-European actors for service to European citizens, businesses, and institutions, to enhance security, create redundancy and resilience, improve opportunities for innovation and digital competitiveness while establishing European governance rules.” Essentially, the European Union has become overly reliant on foreign-owned infrastructure - especially US Big Tech - and if nothing is done soon, EU countries will become subservient to foreign tech companies. Prioritizing areas where Europe can already deliver will be key to shifting resources fast to European suppliers, creating value and market in a virtuous circle.” Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors Among suggestions made on how to achieve a Euro stack are plans for the development of common standards to help EU companies compete and defend against US hyperscalers, establishing a ‘Sovereign Infrastructure Fund’ to publicly fund new digital infrastructure in the EU, and promoting innovation by cutting through the burdensome red tape of EU lawmakers.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The implementation period is from March 17th to 24th. Some sections of the business communication bus operating in the Haneda Airport Development Area will be operated by autonomous "Level 2" driving assistance vehicles. This will verify whether drivers can automate and save on manpower such as riding confirmation and guidance, which are additional tasks other than driving that are currently responsible for other than driving.

The vehicle used is the Tier Four's "Minibus." The process involves booking a ride using an application exclusively for JAL Group employees, and verifying the identity using facial recognition before boarding. In addition to using a facial recognition riding system that utilizes NEC's facial recognition technology, the company will also be verifying real-time driving conditions using a remote monitoring system, safety checks both inside and outside the bus, and "learning media transmission control technology" that supports advanced remote monitoring through AI.

Aspects that did not escape critics, who have underlined, first of all, the fact that the United States are not currently in war, less than less with Venezuela.

Yet the latest and supposedly greatest from Cadillac needed to weigh so very much to achieve a class-leading range target of 460 miles (740 km), thanks to a 205 kWh battery pack. The Escalade IQ shares a modular General Motors (formerly Ultium) chassis and battery pack with the gargantuan Hummer EV, and even more hardware with the Silverado and Sierra pickup truck siblings. And the new IQ certainly puts down plenty of instantaneously available grunt, and despite its mass, it can punch out a 0–60 time in under five seconds with the Velocity Max button pushed, thanks to dual motors rated at 750 hp (560 kW) and 786 lb-ft (1,065 Nm). Three rows of seats will comfortably seat seven adults, and a forthcoming EQL variant stretches just over 4 inches longer with a higher roofline to create even more space in the third row. We know by now that electrification fits well into the super-luxe ethos, because silent and smooth propulsion works better for shorter lifestyle drives. Specifically, the Escalade IQ rides on the same battery cradle, same suspension components, same 24-inch wheel size, and same Michelin Primacy LTX tires as the Silverado EV RST First Edition—a behemoth of a pickup truck that many journalists panned due to the baffling decision by General Motors to spec the largest wheels ever sold on a production vehicle. Even slightly smaller 22-inch wheels, as I can attest after driving a Silverado EV LT, help to reduce the crashy and clunky reverberations that ruined any semblance of passenger serenity.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.theverge.com/news/631053/microsoft-windows-11-update-uninstall-copilot'>Microsoft accidentally wipes out Copilot in latest Windows 11 update</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 11:57:26 <p>

Microsoft’s Copilot app for Windows is being “unintentionally uninstalled” on some Windows 11 devices thanks to the latest monthly Windows update. The Patch Tuesday updates that started rolling out on March 11th have led to Copilot being unpinned from the taskbar and uninstalled.

“We’re aware of an issue with the Microsoft Copilot app affecting some devices,” admits Microsoft in a support document for the March update to Windows 11. Microsoft says it’s working on a fix for the issue, and that affected users can simply reinstall the Copilot app from the Microsoft Store and manually pin it to the taskbar in the meantime.

While this is clearly a bug with the latest Windows update, some Windows 11 users who aren’t interested in Copilot will undoubtedly see it as a feature instead. Microsoft is in the middle of rolling out a native version of its Copilot for Windows app, nearly a year after turning it into a basic web app. The new Copilot app has an improved UI and is also getting a press-to-talk hotkey so you can talk to Microsoft’s AI assistant like you used to be able to do with Cortana in Windows 10.

Microsoft is also working on additional updates to Copilot that it’s planning to unveil at a special 50th anniversary event on April 4th. Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman will be on stage next month to announce new Copilot features, amid rumors that Microsoft is developing its own in-house AI reasoning models to compete with OpenAI.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://wired.com/story/how-do-i-find-a-mattress/'>How Do I Find a Mattress?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 11:31:00 <p>
They contour to the body, providing pressure relief and good motion absorption. Although not always, you can find many cheap mattresses primarily made of foam, but these can be heavy, not provide enough support for back sleepers or those with pain, and can be a hot sleep since there isn’t much airflow with the dense foams. Spring or coil: Often thought of as an old-school mattress style, this bed has a coil-based support system and is generally on the budget side. Springs often lack pressure relief, and aren’t recommended for sleepers with pain. Like memory foam, latex contours to the body, but because of its density, it isn’t the coolest option and they tend to be heavier. The only all-latex organic mattress I’ve tested is the pricey Essentia Tatami Organic Mattress, which was comfortable and not too hot because of drilled air holes (which isn’t always the case), but it was super unstructured (floppy and couldn’t stand on its side without buckling), dense, and heavy (nearly 100 pounds). They combine the best elements of different beds—an innerspring support beneath a top foam for comfort (and often cooling). The top layers are super-comfy foam or latex, with coils (often individually wrapped) underneath for structure. All of my favorite mattresses have been hybrid—I find that the combination of top gel memory foams and wrapped coils beneath also help with airflow and have a cooler sleep. Plus, they can vastly vary on firmness to comfortably contour sleepers in most positions, and have a huge range in price (mid-$300s to thousands). Along with stomach sleepers, side sleepers need a little more give to their mattresses, with enough give to let your shoulder and hips sink to give spinal alignment, but not too much so that your spine (and limbs) are unsupported. If the bed is too firm or uses springs only, the less-distributed side weight can become a really painful position on a harder surface, even leading to limbs falling asleep (any side sleeper who has camped knows the feeling). Most often a hybrid mattress, using a combination of several layers of foam followed by coils or springs that let pressure points like hips and shoulders sink into the bed, work best. That’s why figuring out the best mattress for side sleepers is a bit like the Goldilocks parable—not too firm or too soft, but just right.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

TensorWave, a cloud-platform for AI workloads powered by AMD's MI Instinct accelerators, is kicking off the Beyond CUDA Summit starting today. Attendees can expect to see demonstrations, hot takes, panels, and expert opinions from influential leaders in the AI field including computer architect icons like Jim Keller and Raja Koduri. Nvidia realized the potential of parallel computing on its GPUs early on and developed a proprietary platform dubbed CUDA, which is now the de facto standard for GPU-accelerated computing. Through continuous efforts, optimizations, and the sudden rise of AI which coincidentally is powered by GPUs, Nvidia has positioned itself as a leading solution provider. In fact, 90% of Nvidia's revenue is now driven by its data-center offerings, with CUDA being a central selling point. This creates a vendor lock-in situation, where CUDA (software) effectively confines the industry to Nvidia's hardware, limiting innovation and competition. The industry is shifting gears to a more open-source and hardware-agnostic future, but that's easier said than done. We have OpenCL, ROCm, oneAPI, and Vulkan as alternatives, however, each trails Nvidia in one or many aspects. Even now, ROCm only supports a small selection of modern GPUs while CUDA maintains compatibility with hardware dating back to 2006. AMD's latest RDNA 4 GPUs are still not officially supported by ROCm. Participants have the opportunity to win an AMD Instinct MI210 GPU with 64GB of HBM2e memory.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://japan.cnet.com/article/35230568/'>What are the release date, price, and specs for the "Pixel 9a"? Summary of past rumors</a></h2><b>Source:</b> cnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 11:17:00 <p>
There are rumors that the "Pixel 9a" will be released in March. Previous A-Series devices have been released in conjunction with the developer conference "Google I/O" held every May, but this time it seems likely that it will be faster. In response to this trend, the lower-priced model, the Pixel 9a, may also be released earlier, and according to Android Headlines, the most likely time will be mid-March. The 256GB version is reportedly worth $599 (approximately 89,000 yen). It is often advantageous to keep prices unchanged in a budget-oriented model. Considering that Apple's iPhone 16e is in a less wallet-friendly price range starting at $599, the Pixel 9a may have an advantage if it is lower than this. What will happen to the Pixel 9a design? According to leak information, the biggest change seems to be that there is no camera bar, which is a distinctive feature of the Pixel. According to Android Headlines, the Pixel 9a's wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle cameras seem to be almost flat on the back. The renderings published by Sudhanshu Ambhore on social media X also feature a more minimalist camera design, with two lenses being placed conservatively on the left side of the back. Google Pixel 9a renders thread (without watermark) pic.twitter.com/WpFU6MTeBe — Sudhanshu Ambhore (@Sudhanshu1414) February 17, 2025 Since pixel count is not everything, Google will explain that it has strengthened its camera in a different way this time (I personally think a lot of AI-based enhancements will be mentioned). According to the rendering, there are also new colors. The Pixel 9a is said to be in the lineup of porcelain (white), obsidian (black), peony (pink), and iris (purple). The volume buttons also seem to be modest. While this will keep prices down, you may not be able to use the Pixel 9's flagship feature, "satellite SOS" (requires a 5400 modem). According to Android Headlines, the Pixel 9a's battery capacity is 5100mAh. If it is true that it will be thinner than the previous model, improving battery life will be even more appreciated. It is unclear how true these rumors will become, but they may be revealed surprisingly soon.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.wired.it/article/cuore-di-titanio-sperimentazione-come-funziona/'>How the Titanium heart works with which a man lived for over 100 days</a></h2><b>Source:</b> wired&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 11:04:24 <p>
He returned home with a titanium heart, waiting for an organ transplant. It is an Australian man, about 40 years old and with a severe heart failure, which has become the first person in the world to be able to leave the hospital with a similar device and to live with it for over 100 days. To date, in fact, no other patient had succeeded and this, therefore, could open the way to a potential swab solution for people with heart failure waiting for a heart donor. The heart of Titanium, called Bivacor Total Artificial Heart (TAH), was invented by the biomedical engineer Daniel Timms, founder of the Australian-Stantenese company who takes its name from this device, which we remember to be still in the experimentation phase. Unlike other devices, which have many parts that often spoil themselves, Bivacor has no valves or mechanical bearings has only a mobile part, and therefore, it could be less subject to problems of mechanical wear. As the doctors of St Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Australia, where the operations were performed, the patient lived with the heart of Titanium for more than three months (from November 2024) until he was subjected to surgery to receive a donated human heart has been performed. The patient, experts know, is taking back well and this last goal could help research better understand how people can live with this device in the real world and if, in the future, it can be used as a temporary measure. "This revolutionary procedure, performed at the end of last year, marks a new era in heart transplant and offers new hopes for patients with heart failure," commented the experts. According to some cardiologists, as reported by Nature, the heart of titanium could even become a permanent option for people not suitable for transplants due to age or other health conditions. The last Australian patient is part of the US experimentation, led by Joseph Rogers, a cardiologist specialized in cardiac failure and president of the Texas Heart Institute of Houston, in which five patients between forty and sixty years received a previous version of the bivacor last year.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Back when EV enthusiasm was higher, there were fits and starts of vehicle-to-home concepts and products. If EVs and their ginormous batteries are expensive, resource-intensive purchases, the thinking went, maybe we should get something more out of them than just groceries and school pick-ups. Maybe we could find other things for that huge battery to do during the 95 percent of time it spends parked in or near our homes. An EV powering your whole home, or even pushing power back to the grid, is something higher-end EVs might do at some point with some utilities. I have a Chevy Bolt, an EV that does not have even a three-prong 110 V plug on it, let alone power-your-home potential. If I wanted to keep the essentials running during an outage, it seemed like I needed to buy a fuel-based generator—or one of those big portable power stations. Inverters take the direct current available from your vehicle's 12V battery—the lead-acid brick inside almost every car—and turns it into alternating current suitable for standard plugs. Inverters designed for car batteries have been around a long time, opening up both novel and emergency uses. It's by no means a whole-home solution—my kit maker, EV Extend, recommends drawing just 1,000 watts of continuous power so as not to drain the battery too far or damage the electronics. But it's certainly better than having only flashlights, USB battery packs, and the power utility's website open on your phone.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Hitachi (Hitachi) announced that it has developed a "deep insight estimation technology" to deal with supply chain disruptions caused by natural disasters and pandemics. This technology utilizes the generated AI to estimate the manufacturing bases of suppliers with high accuracy, allowing for quick responses when risks occur. A verification within the Hitachi Group confirmed that manufacturing base information can be estimated with an accuracy of over 85%. This technology can significantly reduce the huge amount of information collected and narrowing down by hand when a risk occurs, such as an earthquake or a typhoon. For example, in the event of an earthquake, it is possible to quickly identify manufacturing bases in areas with high shaking, and take measures such as increasing inventory and securing alternative sources. The generated AI is then used to extract information that can be a manufacturing base from open data such as the official company website, ISO authentication information, and map information. According to Hitachi, the risks of impacting supply chains, such as natural disasters, pandemics and geopolitical conflicts, have increased in recent years. In particular, in manufacturing, which has a large number of suppliers, risk management and strengthening resilience are important issues. The company is working in collaboration with the University of Tokyo Digital Observership Research Promotion Agency to visualize procurement risks by capturing risks that will affect manufacturing. Furthermore, we will promote the social implementation of risk management systems/services through collaboration with government and partners.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In this demonstration experiment, footage of security cameras installed inside and at various Tokyu Railway stations is analyzed using the AI ​​security system "AI Security asilla," developed by Ajira, to detect abnormal behavior such as troubles and falls. This reduces the burden on security guards and allows for efficient and effective security systems to be established. Using the patented "discomfort detection," AI autonomously learns its actions from the images of each camera, and detects movements that are different from normal as "discomfort." AI constantly monitors the video, allowing users to detect and notify small movements that people may miss. The existing camera can be used as is, which reduces initial costs. A single server can process up to 50 camera images, allowing for low-cost operation even in large-scale facilities. Since it is completed within a local network, the risk of video leakage to the outside can be reduced. Azira has complied with the Personal Information Protection Act and related guidelines and has formulated a basic policy regarding the acquisition, use and storage of data. In principle, information obtained through AI Security Asilla is only images with posture and facial information removed, and does not include information that can identify a specific individual.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Baidu, the Chinese company that holds the most used search engine in the country, joins the frenetic artificial intelligence race that also affects China. According to Reuters reported, yesterday the company announced the launch of two new models to: Ernie 4.5, the latest version of the model released about two years ago, and Ernie X1, the first Baidu model to be equipped with a reasoning capacity. On the occasion of the announcement, the company specified the characteristics of the new models arriving on the market, designed to compete in the best way with Deepseek, the Chinese startup that in recent months has fueled the race of the sector companies to the development of models to the advanced.

To use Baidu's words, therefore, Ernie 4.5 stands out for "an excellent skill of multimodal understanding", "a more advanced linguistic capacity" than its predecessor and "understanding, generation, logic and memory" understanding "capacity". To this is also added a "high QE" - emotional quotient, the ability to discern emotions and similar - which allows it to understand the satirical memes and cartoons that circulate on the net. As for Ernie X1, however, the company has kept us to clarify that it is the first model equipped with a reasoning capacity capable of using the tools in an independent way. Compared to its predecessors, in fact, it boasts "greater understanding, planning, reflection and evolution", which makes it capable of offering "performance equal to Deepseek R1, at a halved price".

In short, with this announcement Baidu returns to get noticed two years after the launch of his Ernie Bot, one of the first models to the launched by a Chinese company.

Before he received his termination notice, he says, Copeland had just spent several months training the only dog stationed in Florida capable of detecting the Giant African land snail, an invasive mollusk that poses a significant threat to Florida agriculture. “We have dogs for spotted and lantern flies, Asian longhorn beetles,” he says, referring to two other non-native species. Teams devoted to inspecting plant and food imports have been hit especially hard by the recent cuts, including the Plant Protection and Quarantine program, which has lost hundreds of staffers alone. “It’s causing problems left and right,” says one current USDA worker, who like other federal employees in this story asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “These aren’t your average people,” says Mike Lahar, the regulatory affairs manager at US customs broker behemoth Deringer.

There is growing concern about Chinese-made artificial intelligence (AI) models like DeepSeek, but there is a new study that suggests that the anxiety may be overstated, at least when it comes to data privacy. In fact, some popular US-based AI chatbots may collect user personal information more than DeepSeek. Data released in February 2025 by well-known VPN provider Surfshark has revealed that Google Gemini is the most data-intensive AI chat app. In contrast, DeepSeek ranked fifth out of the 10 popular apps surveyed. The research team analyzed detailed privacy-related information about Apple's top popular chatbots, ChatGPT, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok, Jasper, Poe, Claude, and Pi. We then compared the types of data that each app collects, such as whether it collects data associated with users and whether it contains third-party advertisers in the app. This survey led to the determination that Google Gemini collects much more personal information than its competitors. In particular, Copilot, Poe and Jasper collect data to track users. This means that user data collected from the app is associated with third-party data for the purposes of targeting ads and ad metrics.

Taara’s current tech involves firing a narrow beam of light from one traffic light-sized terminal to another, with transmission of up to 20 gigabits per second over 20km (almost 12.5 miles) distances. The terminals can be mounted on towers, and are quicker and cheaper to install than laying fiber — especially when you need a signal to reach an island, cross a river, or arrive at some otherwise hard-to-reach location. Last month the company announced that it has condensed its tech into a much more compact chip, which it expects to launch in a product in 2026. “We can offer 10, if not 100 times more bandwidth to an end user than a typical Starlink antenna, and do it for a fraction of the cost,” founder Mahesh Krishnaswamy told Wired. Taara itself has its origins in another X project, Loon, which imagined distributing data by shooting lasers around a network of 20-mile-high balloons. Believe it or not, that proved unfeasible in the end, and Loon was wound down in 2021 — just three years after it too “graduated” from Alphabet’s moonshot program. Loon’s lasers were repurposed into Taara’s towers by Krishnaswamy, though the tech also found a third home in Aalyria, another spin-off that focuses on coordinating satellite and airborne mesh networks, and has its own Tightbeam project that sounds similar to Taara.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

When adolescence was announced on Netflix I thought, very superficially (now I realize it) that it was a thriller with the typical boy à la macaulay culkin in the innocence of the devil. The reassuring diabolical child of the films so exaggerated that he cannot look like any of the teenagers we know, including our children. The fact that it was a British series and that Stephen Graham had been half had to make me rise, is true, but I continued in my blessed ignorance until the moment of the miniseries exit on the platform. He was perfectly right and I will focus on the second part of the sentence, that is, that the series is a breathless nightmare, from the first moment he does not discounts at the last moment, he leaves no spiral. Many (including me) have hoped for one of those saving finals that arrange everything and make us go to sleep peacefully. This is not the case, from the first episode we know very well that there is no escape. Jamie (Owen Cooper, of an impressive skill) killed Katie, his schoolmate. We still don't know the reason, but he did it, the rehearsals are overwhelming, they show us, we are there in the police station sitting together with Jamie and his father. The painful alternation between the moments in which the boy makes us an immense tenderness and those in which he is very afraid, the banality of evil in the gaze and gestures of a thirteen year old with a beautiful face and a voice that in some moments still brings traces of childhood (and this is truly a stab to the heart for anyone who has had to do with that strange and commented phase in which in the adolescent, the child was, the child who was, the child who was a few years old. A 'normal' boy completely devoid of tools to manage emotion, with very serious consequences.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

According to reports doing rounds on social media, the model’s image generation feature — rolled out last week as part of an expansion in Google’s developer-facing AI Studio — can not only strip watermarks but also fill in the resulting gaps with surprising accuracy. Social media platforms like X and Reddit have buzzed with user demonstrations of Gemini’s capabilities. Unlike competitors such as Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet or OpenAI’s GPT-4o — which explicitly refuse such tasks, with Claude labeling watermark removal “unethical and potentially illegal” — Gemini 2.0 Flash operates with few guardrails, amplifying its controversial appeal. Under U.S. copyright law, removing watermarks without consent is generally illegal, barring rare exceptions, as outlined by legal experts. This has left copyright holders wary, especially given the tool’s potential to undermine protections for photographers, artists, and media companies. Google has yet to comment on the backlash, with inquiries sent outside normal business hours unanswered as of March 16, 2025. In late 2023, OpenAI faced scrutiny when its DALL-E 3 model was found generating near-exact replicas of copyrighted artwork, prompting lawsuits from artists alleging intellectual property theft. Midjourney has also faced criticism of its own, and so have social media platforms like Instagram. These incidents highlight a recurring theme: as AI tools grow more powerful, their developers struggle to balance innovation with responsibility. For now, the feature remains accessible in Google’s experimental sandbox, but its implications could ripple far beyond.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This allows for rich text messages to be exchanged with Android. However, these messages were not encrypted and there was a security risk. Apple said that it will support end-to-end encryption of RCS messages with its upcoming iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS updates. This means that rich text messages exchanged between Apple and Android users are automatically protected by the latest industry standards. On March 14th, the industry group GSM Association (GSMA) announced a new RCS specification that includes end-to-end encryption. According to GSMA, by adding security features such as SIM-based authentication, end-to-end encryption helps maintain the privacy of RCS messages and protects against threats such as fraud and fraud. Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer said in a statement cited in media such as The Verge: "End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since its inception. In December 2024, the Federal Investigation Agency (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommended that mobile users use messaging apps that have encryption enabled by default. This is due to cyberattacks from telecommunications companies such as AT&T, Verizon and Lumen Technologies. iMessage, Apple's standard messaging service, has long been able to encrypt text messages. On the other hand, Google's messaging app also has the ability to encrypt text as standard, but this is also effective only among Android users.

The analysis results of the 2024 DX Awareness Survey - IT Modernization Edition, published by PwC Consulting in December 2024 showed that only 41% of companies responded that "DX results are as expected or even greater." In other words, more than half of the companies have not yet achieved sufficient results. The aforementioned investigation also highlights the reality that Japanese companies are trying to advance DX, but "we are so busy with our daily work that we can't find time." IT development and operation is still being carried out by a lot of manual work By utilizing automation technology, the efficiency of standard operations and the reduction of mistakes will be improved, creating an environment where IT staff can focus on more sophisticated and strategic issues. Unlike traditional on-premises, the cloud can technically create new environments and change resources in just a few minutes. When we explore the reasons for this, there are steps such as accepting applications, confirming parameters, checking consistency with internal security standards, checking settings and preparing work, building them, and finally, testing whether the settings are set as designed, and each step takes 2-3 days. The current situation is that what could normally be provided in just a few minutes has been spent incredible amounts of time by going through these steps. To overcome this situation, it is necessary to move away from manual work in infrastructure construction and operational work and promote automation as much as possible. In this case, the base template is prepared in advance with settings that follow the company's internal security standards and authority policies, and tests are automated, making it possible to provide an environment that complies with the company's internal regulations at an early stage and without human intervention. CI/CD is becoming more familiar with application development, but by converting IaC in the infrastructure field, it also incorporates the CI/CD style, and like applications, tests are automatically performed when environment changes, and it is automatically provisioned at a time when quality is guaranteed. CI/CD reduces the number of manual tasks that were performed during conventional system updates, from checking the extent of impact to running tests and releasing to production environments. In this way, by utilizing IaC and CI/CD, we can expect not only to automate environment construction and operational operations, but also to significantly reduce lead times. In addition, automation will increase the number of work that can be handled per person, and even if new uses or changes are increased in the future, it will be possible to handle it with minimal personnel.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

There aren’t many cars that are expected to sell out before anyone has even seen the interior, but the Renault 5 Turbo 3E could well be one of them. Three years on from the concept launch at the Paris Motorshow in 2022, the anticipated hyper-hatchback and the electric reboot of the iconic Renault 5 Turbo and Turbo 2 has now been revealed—at least partly. At a brand-hosted event at Renault HQ near Paris, the new hot hatch’s exterior was unveiled for the first time outside of renders, and, as seems to be increasingly the case with production versions of EV concepts, it looks every bit as bonkers as suggested—complete with the striking yellow and black livery of the 1982 Renault 5 Turbo rally model. Renault has said this is its most powerful, most advanced car yet, going as far as to label it the world's first electric mini-supercar. With its prominent bumper and rear wing extensions, the design inspiration the compact hot-hatch has taken from its namesake is clear, but it also borrows several elements from the Renault 5 E-Tech electric, including the rear lights and wing mirrors. Unlike that car, though, the Turbo 5 3E is exclusively rear-wheel drive and is built on a new platform that moves the windscreen back and extends the wheelbase out, giving it the width of a supercar in the length of a city car. It uses rear in-wheel motors that, Renault says, will bring the Turbo 5 3E in line with the performance of supercars like the Ferrari Roma and McLaren Artura, delivering every bit of torque to the car’s 20-inch wheels immediately, with no loss and no lag time. This car will not only be fast, it is apparently going to be a drifter’s dream. The specs are impressive: 540 hp, a maximum speed of 168 mph, and 0–60 mph in 3.5 seconds, all helped by a lightweight, carbon fiber body. Renault says the 5 Turbo 3E will be capable of DC fast charging up to 350 kW with an 800-volt architecture, which should take 15 minutes to charge from 15 to 80 percent with the right charger.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On the contrary: With 94 percent, less than half of the IT and digital areas are female in almost all German companies. Another 9 percent of the respondents are currently planning internal goals for more women in IT and digital professions, another 13 percent discuss it. On the other hand, such goals for 38 percent of companies are not an issue. As reasons to have not yet anchored any goals, most of these companies state that they do not have enough qualified applicants (68 percent) or other priorities (61 percent). “Women bring new perspectives and other experiences in companies. This diversity not only strengthens technological innovation and competitiveness. Winning more women for IT and digital professions is also a question of participation and equal participation in digitization, ”said Bitkom managing director Bernhard Rohleder. In order to gain more women especially for IT and digital professions, a majority of 60 percent of companies use targeted recruiting measures, the survey continued. Cooperations with universities and schools that already maintain 24 percent of companies are most widespread to win women for IT and digital professions. At the same time, half (50 percent) also says that a male-shaped culture in IT and digital professions is shocking women. For example, on the one hand, over two thirds (69 percent) of companies say that IT and digital professions have to be more attractive for women, but on the other hand, 39 percent also believe that men are more suitable for IT and digital professions. “Anyone who hangs up such a misconception must not be surprised about the shortage of skilled workers. 52 percent observe hurdles when it comes to transition, for example, employment agencies would less often recommend an IT-specific further training.

Initiatives to build new, independent search indexes have started — such as Brave Search or the new partnership between Qwant and Ecosia — but building a search index is a big project and it will take a lot of time to get the quality of these new products to where Google and Bing are now. All of the biggest map software apps are owned by big tech companies, as are most big AI models and LLM services, instant messaging apps, operating systems, browsers, social media platforms — and a lot more. The main problems with current alternatives are that firstly, they’re too small. Secondly, many are built on existing infrastructure from companies like Microsoft and Google. Availability, affordability, and convenience are always pushing us into the hands of American big tech companies. If the EU decides that its people and its organizations need to have access to homegrown alternatives — you can bet those alternatives will be available worldwide. That means more tech for everyone, and with the strict data laws in the EU, we would finally have a choice between selling our data and not selling it (instead of the choice we have now, which is just deciding who to sell it to).</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Open source software used by more than 23,000 organizations, some of them in large enterprises, was compromised with credential-stealing code after attackers gained unauthorized access to a maintainer account, in the latest open source supply-chain attack to roil the Internet.

The corrupted package, tj-actions/changed-files, is part of tj-actions, a collection of files that's used by more than 23,000 organizations. Tj-actions is one of many GitHub Actions, a form of platform for streamlining software available on the open source developer platform. Actions are a core means of implementing what's known as CI/CD, short for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery).

Scraping server memory at scale

On Friday or earlier, the source code for all versions of tj-actions/changed-files received unauthorized updates that changed the "tags" developers use to reference specific code versions. The tags pointed to a publicly available file that copies the internal memory of severs running it, searches for credentials, and writes them to a log. In the aftermath, many publicly accessible repositories running tj-actions ended up displaying their most sensitive credentials in logs anyone could view.

"The scary part of actions is that they can often modify the source code of the repository that is using them and access any secret variables associated with a workflow," HD Moore, founder and CEO of runZero and an expert in open source security, said in an interview. "The most paranoid use of actions is to audit all of the source code, then pin the specific commit hash instead of the tag into the ... the workflow, but this is a hassle."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The rise of generative AI has been a fairly messy process, especially from fair usage ethics and copyright perspective. Multiple users on X and Reddit have shared demonstrations of how Google’s latest Gemini 2.0 series AI model can remove watermarks from copyright-protected images. Notably, it’s not only erasing those banner-style watermarks, but also fairly complex overlays with design and stylized text elements. Gemini flash does remove watermark nicely :) pic.twitter.com/1Dz9Nlw1iU — Ajitesh (@ajiteshleo) March 17, 2025 The model in question is the Gemini 2.0 Flash, which was released earlier this year and got a reasoning upgrade, as well. Trying to do so returns a message like this: It is important to respect the copyright laws and intellectual property rights. Digital Trends successfully removed watermarks from a variety of images using the Gemini 2.0 Flash (Image Generation) Experimental model. We strongly recommend that you don’t replicate these steps. It is a violation of local copyright laws and any usage of AI-modified material without due consent could land you in legal trouble. Moreover, it is a deeply unethical act, which is also why artists and authors are fighting in court over companies using their work to train AI models without duly compensating them or seeking their explicit nod. The output image, however, has its own Gemini watermark, which itself can be removed with a simple crop. There are a few minor differences in the final image produced by Gemini after its watermark removal process, such as slightly different color temperatures and fuzzy surface details in photorealistic shots. The degree of variation is not too deep, and any person with even basic skills in image editing can fix it and achieve results similar to the original copyright-protected image. In 2023, Google signed a pledge — alongside fellow AI companies including Meta, Anthropic, Amazon, and OpenAI — to implement a watermarking system in AI-generated material. Earlier this year, Google added a system called SynthID digital watermarking for all photos that have been touched up using the AI Reimagine tool in the Photos app. The watermark is not visible and can’t be seen by human eyes, but machines can detect and verify their AI origins. I tried removing the watermark from the set of images with other AI models, but Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT explicitly rejected the request, citing copyright laws and fair usage policies. The tool was tested on images belonging to well-known stock photography databases across a wide range of categories such as food, nature, and fashion. The whole multi-stage system relied on detection, matting, reconstruction, decomposition, and blend factoring techniques. The idea was to stir a debate and improve watermark security. With Gemini, we are looking at a tool accessible to everyone without any coding or technical know-how required. Aside from violating local laws, it takes away from the hard work of artists and photographers, who are already facing an uphill battle because their material was used to train AI without their knowledge or paying them for it. But it’s not just the court battles that are of concern. Generative AI tools are being adopted widely, at the cost of human workers losing their livelihoods. We are not entirely sure whether Gemini removing watermarks from copyright-protected images is a bug. However, we do hope it’s a misstep and that the underlying image editing framework is fixed to ensure that it can even block workarounds. Digital Trends has reached out to Google for comments and will update this story when we hear back.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

And we’re making it easy for you to follow along. Here’s how to watch the Nvidia GTC 2025 keynote online, along with many other sessions, talks, and panels. Well, Nvidia typically reserves a big chunk of the conference for GPU-related debuts. A new, upgraded iteration of the company’s Blackwell chip lineup seems likely. During Nvidia’s most recent earnings call, Huang confirmed that the upcoming Blackwell B300 series, codenamed Blackwell Ultra, is slated for release in the second half of this year. In addition to higher computing performance, Blackwell Ultra cards pack more memory (288GB), an attractive feature for customers looking to run and train memory-hungry AI models. Rubin, Nvidia’s next-gen GPU series, is almost certain to get a mention at GTC alongside Blackwell Ultra. Huang said during the aforementioned Nvidia earnings call that he’d talk about post-Rubin products at GTC, as well. Beyond GPUs, Nvidia may illuminate its approach to recent quantum computing advancements. One thing’s for sure: Nvidia could use a win. Early Blackwell cards reportedly suffered from severe overheating issues, causing customers to cut their orders. U.S. export controls and fears of tariffs have massively depressed Nvidia’s stock price in recent months. Huang has asserted that DeepSeek’s rise to prominence will in fact be a net positive for Nvidia because it’ll accelerate the broader adoption of AI technology. But Huang is reportedly feeling impatient to see AI applications that matter beyond the tech industry.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Scores of European tech leaders have joined the call for the EU to become less reliant on overseas tech and pursue a strategy of independence, saying the bloc was in an “acute moment of crisis”. Aerospace giant Airbus, cloud storage firm Cubbit and lobby groups such as the European AI Forum and the European Startup Network are among the 100 or so signatories of an open letter to European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen. Signatories of the letter have called on the EU to create a sovereign infrastructure fund to galvanise investment in tech across the bloc, as part of a series of demands. The issue has become more pronounced amid faltering relations between the US and EU after a broadside by US vice president JD Vance, who questioned European values. The 2024 Draghi report highlighted that the EU needs more coordinated industrial policy, more rapid decisions and massive investment if it wants to keep pace economically with the US and China. "Europe needs to recover the initiative and become more technologically independent across all layers of its critical digital infrastructure: from logical Infrastructure - applications, platforms, media, AI frameworks and models - to physical infrastructure - chips, computing, storage and connectivity. "Europe’s current multiple dependencies create security and reliability risks, compromise our sovereignty and hurt our growth." "To support Europe in this acute moment of crisis for our security and strategic autonomy, the Commission must urgently form and convene working groups with industry to transform its tech sovereignty ambition into concrete actions." As well as a call for an EU sovereign infrastructure fund, the letter also calls for the EU to prioritise services with strong adoption projects, such as those in cybersecurity and prioritising “result-oriented projects”. Signatories of the letter back the EuroStack initiative, which is championing EU digital sovereignty and calling for Europe to play a bigger role in digital supply chains.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In a letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sent on March 14, 2025, the EuroStack Initiative stresses that the continent can no longer afford to rely on non-European technologies. The group, which includes major tech companies, industry associations, and civil society organizations, is calling for a drastic overhaul of Europe’s digital policy. The core of their proposal is clear: Europe must reduce its reliance on foreign tech providers and invest in local solutions. “It has been clear for some time that Europe cannot regulate itself out of its laggard position. It needs to take proactive industrial action: it has enormous talent, capabilities, assets and business record in the digital space, but the legacy of our structural fragmentation (as described Even with the positive announcements at the Paris AI Action Summit, Europe will lose out on digital innovation and productivity growth without sweeping and urgent change – our reliance on non-European technologies will become almost complete in less than three years at current rates.” A key component of the coalition’s proposal is the establishment of a “Buy European” procurement policy, which would ensure that public sector spending supports European technology providers. This policy would aim to create demand for European-made digital solutions and encourage local innovation. The proposal for a Sovereign Infrastructure Fund is key in this regard. This fund would facilitate public and private investment in critical digital infrastructure, particularly in sectors such as chip manufacturing and quantum computing, which require significant capital. This fund would target high-risk, high-reward areas, with the aim of creating a robust and competitive European tech industry that can stand on its own. “What business needs is a pragmatic industrial policy strategy to reduce our dependencies in critical technologies, while focusing on selected initiatives to overcome Europe’s structural challenges – fragmentation, suppression of local demand, focus on research rather than productization, lack of adequate capital – to promote productivity growth and security. The ambitious initiative addresses Europe’s fragmented digital ecosystem by proposing a federated approach where resources from various industries are pooled together to create scalable, secure, and interoperable solutions. According to the initiative’s vision, Europe must focus on building a robust digital stack—ranging from data storage and cloud computing to higher-level applications such as AI and cybersecurity. By doing so, Europe can reduce its reliance on foreign technologies, particularly in critical sectors that underpin national security and economic stability. While EuroStack is focused on developing local infrastructure, it also remains open to collaboration with non-European companies. The coalition’s letter calls for stronger safeguards to protect European data and prevent foreign interference in critical sectors. One of the key proposals is the establishment of a certification scheme for sovereign cloud services that comply with European standards for data protection and cybersecurity. As Europe faces increasing geopolitical risks, the coalition believes that developing sovereign cloud services and other essential infrastructure is necessary to ensure the continent’s security. EuroStack’s proposal to pool resources from diverse industries aims to address this fragmentation and create a cohesive digital infrastructure that can support Europe’s future needs. Despite these challenges, the coalition remains confident that Europe can regain control over its digital future. By fostering investment in local tech solutions, creating demand through procurement policies, and prioritizing European-led infrastructure, the coalition believes that Europe can reduce its reliance on foreign technologies and ensure its digital sovereignty.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

I wonder how much corporate espionage there is? Like if you work in a high-touch, high-dollar sales business — enterprise software, investment banking, etc. — much of your time will be spent pitching new customers who are choosing between you and your competitors, or pitching customers who currently work with your competitors, or trying to retain customers who are thinking of switching to your competitors. If you knew what your competitors were up to, that would help. You could get to the customer first and offer a discount. You could see what your competitor says about the features of its own product, and try to build those features into your product. So, you know, find a salesperson at your competitor and recruit her. Not to quit your competitor and come work for you, but to stay at your competitor and spy for you. You give her quarterly bags of cash; she looks at your competitor’s pipeline and keeps you up to date on who it is pitching and what it is saying. Obviously this is not legal advice — it seems problematic in all sorts of ways — but surely people try it from time to time?</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Spy accusations inflame an H.R. rivalry

One of the most bitter rivalries in the world of H.R. service providers just took a turn that wouldn’t be out of place in a spy thriller.

Rippling on Monday sued Deel, accusing its competitor of hiring a mole in its Dublin office to comb through Rippling’s trade secrets, a scheme that reached its rival’s highest ranks, DealBook’s Michael de la Merced reports. Rippling said it had uncovered the defector through a “honeypot” trap — a Slack channel set up specifically for the ruse that was mentioned in a letter to top Deel executives.

“We’re all for healthy competition, but we won’t tolerate when a competitor breaks the law,” Vanessa Wu, Rippling’s general counsel, said in a statement. A Deel spokeswoman said in a statement, “Weeks after Rippling is accused of violating sanctions law in Russia and seeding falsehoods about Deel, Rippling is trying to shift the narrative with these sensationalized claims. We deny all legal wrongdoing and look forward to asserting our counterclaims.”

The back story: Both companies have turned the seemingly humdrum business of human resources into multibillion-dollar operations. Rippling was most recently valued at $13.5 billion, according to the data provider Pitchbook, while Deel was valued at more than $12 billion. Aggressiveness also runs in their DNA, especially at Rippling, whose co-founder and C.E.O., Parker Conrad, is known for an especially hard-charging managerial style.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Social media users have discovered a controversial application of Google's new AI model, Gemini 2.0 Flash. Apparently, it is capable of removing watermarks from images, including those from Getty Images, Shutterstock, and other popular photo stocks. Last week, Google expanded access to the image creation feature in the Gemini 2.0 Flash model, which allows not only creating, but also editing graphic content. However, this feature seems to have weak protection against misuse. Gemini 2.0 Flash does not hesitate to create images of celebrities and copyrighted characters and, as already mentioned, to remove watermarks. All the user has to do is select Gemini 2.0 Flash (Image Generation) Experimental option in the model select, upload a picture to the chatbot and enter a prompt similar to "remove watermark from image." However, it does not always do this correctly: it has difficulty with translucent marks and watermarks that cover a large part of the image. Below is an example where the word 'Getty' was replaced with 'Geck' during processing. Other AI-based tools have similar capabilities, but Gemini 2.0 Flash is particularly adept at this and is also available for free. Nevertheless, AI models by Google's competitors, such as Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4o, refuse to remove watermarks, claiming it is a copyright violation to do so without the owner's consent.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In Brief

Texas software developer Davis Lu faces up to 10 years in prison after a federal jury convicted him of “causing intentional damage” to his former employer’s network.

According to the Justice Department, Lu, 55, began sabotaging his employer’s systems after a 2018 corporate restructuring left Lu with reduced responsibilities and system access.

Lu is accused of creating and implementing a “kill switch” that would lock out all of the company’s employees from the network if Lu’s credentials were ever deactivated. Prosecutors say Lu named the kill switch code “IsDLEnabledinAD,” referring to whether Lu’s account is enabled in the company’s Active Directory.

When Lu left the company on September 9, 2019, the kill switch activated, causing widespread system disruptions affecting thousands of employees globally. The Justice Department said Lu caused the company “hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses.”

Marko Elez, a DOGE staffer working at the U.S. Treasury, emailed a spreadsheet with unencrypted personally identifiable information to two Trump administration officials prior to his resignation in early February after racist social media posts linked to Elez surfaced online. Details of the security lapse emerged in a court filing on Friday containing testimony by David Ambrose, the chief security and privacy officer at the Treasury’s Bureau of Fiscal Services, the division of the Treasury that disburses some trillions of dollars in federal funds to American households every year. A coalition of U.S. attorneys general brought the lawsuit in an effort to block the Trump administration’s team of DOGE cost-cutters from accessing highly sensitive personal and financial data on millions of Americans held by the Treasury unit where Elez was posted. Per the court filing on Friday, Ambrose said the Treasury conducted a forensic analysis of Elez’s department-issued laptop following his resignation, which included a review of his Treasury email account revealing the security lapse. The filing did not say exactly what data was shared, but described the personal information as including a name (such as a person or entity), the type of transaction, and an amount of money.

Despite growing concern, Google has yet to release an official statement addressing Gemini 2.0 Flash’s watermark removal capabilities. SynthID embeds imperceptible digital markers that remain intact even after common image manipulations, helping creators and platforms verify content authenticity. Notably, SynthID itself has limitations, as researchers have shown that sophisticated watermarking techniques can be bypassed or altered without significantly degrading image quality. The issue of watermarking is a persistent challenge in AI development. The model’s ability to remove watermarks and generatively fill gaps raises questions about the effectiveness of AI safeguards and Google’s strategy for preventing misuse across its AI products. These refusal mechanisms are designed to curb misuse and uphold ethical boundaries. Under U.S. copyright law, removing watermarks from copyrighted content without the owner’s consent is generally prohibited, barring rare exceptions. Beyond legal considerations, the broader tech community is reacting with unease. Discussions on platforms like Reddit have highlighted not only Gemini’s technical prowess but also the ethical dilemmas it presents. As some users pointed out that while the AI effectively removes watermarks, the resulting images occasionally exhibit subtle alterations—such as color changes and unnatural textures—that could undermine their authenticity. The absence of consistent safeguards across AI models highlights an urgent need for clearer guidelines and more robust protections.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Creating a startup that competes with your former employer can be risky. Flexport is suing the pair alleging that they stole thousands of its documents along with its source code to create their own rival startup, Freightmate AI. Both startups use technology to automate complex logistics and shipping processes. Flexport claims that Zhao took steps to hide his tracks like using Incognito Mode on his browser to copy-paste a list of over 1,000 Flexport customers. The suit alleges that Zhao also downloaded Flexport’s source code from Github onto his USB drive. Freightmate admitted to being in possession of some files from Flexport but said the files were “inadvertently retained” and not accessed or used by Freightmate, according to the suit. Flexport claims recent growth touted by Freightmate would have been “virtually impossible” without information it insists was stolen. It is suing for unspecified damages and an injunction from the court, which could be used to stop Freightmate from using the allegedly stolen data. It most recently raised a $260 million round provided by Shopify at an undisclosed valuation in 2023. Freightmate is based near Seattle and raised a $5 million seed round in January 2025 led by Washington state VC firm Fuse Capital.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/yc-backed-reactwise-is-applying-ai-to-speed-up-drug-manufacturing/'>YC-backed ReactWise is applying AI to speed up drug manufacturing</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techcrunch&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 00:00:00 <p>
This is where ReactWise is offering to step in with its “AI copilot for chemical process optimization,” which it says accelerates by 30x the standard trial-and-error-based process of figuring out the best method for making a drug. “Making drugs is really like cooking,” said co-founder and CEO Alexander Pomberger (pictured above left, with co-founder and CTO Daniel Wigh) in a call with TechCrunch. The startup’s machine learning AI models can still deliver major savings by reducing how much iteration is required to get past this bit of the drug development chain. “The inspiration for this was: I’m a chemist by training, I worked in Big Pharma, and I saw how tedious and trial-and-error driven the whole industry is,” he said, adding that the business is essentially consolidating five years of academic research — his doctorate focused on “the automation of chemical synthesis driven by robotic workflow and AI” — into what he bills as “a simple software.” Underpinning ReactWise’s product are “thousands” of reactions that the startup has performed in its labs in order to capture data-points to feed its AI-driven predictions. Pomberger says the startup used a “high throughput screening” method in its lab, which allowed it to screen 300 reactions at a time, enabling it to speed up the process of capturing all this training data for its AI. It’s working toward spanning 20,000 chemical data points to “cover the most important reactions.” So far it’s focused on manufacturing processes for “small molecule drugs,” which Pomberger said can be used in medicines targeting all sorts of diseases. But he suggested that the technology could be applied in other disciplines, too, noting that the company is also working with two material manufacturers in polymer drug delivery development. ReactWise’s automation play also includes software that can interface with robotic lab equipment to further dial up precision manufacturing of drugs. The U.K. startup, which was founded in July 2024, has 12 pilot trials of its software up and running with pharma companies. ReactWise is disclosing full details of its pre-seed raise, which totals $3.4 million, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch. The rest of the funding (around $1.5 million) is coming from unnamed venture capitalists and angel investors, who ReactWise says are “committed to advancing AI-driven, sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing.” While ReactWise is focusing, fairly narrowly, on a specific part of the drug development chain, Pomberger said acceleration here can make a meaningful difference in shrinking the time it takes to get new pharmaceuticals to patients. Simultaneously, other startups are applying AI to different aspects of drug development, including identifying interesting chemicals in the first place, so there’s likely to be compounding effects as more automation innovations get folded in. But when it comes to drug manufacturing, specifically, Pomberger argues that ReactWise is ahead of the pack. The startup competes with legacy software using statistical approaches, such as JMP. He also said that there are a few others applying AI to speed up drug manufacturing, but said that ReactWise’s access to high-quality datasets on chemical reactions gives it the competitive edge. “But, from our side of things, we offer these pretrained models — and those are extremely powerful because they fundamentally understand chemistry. And the idea is then to really have a client just say: ‘This is my reaction of interest, hit start, and we already give them process recommendations from the very first day, based on all the pre-work that we did in our laboratory.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The first satellite of the Google-backed FireSat constellation successfully made it to orbit over the weekend, kicking off what promises to be a new era in wildfire detection and monitoring. The constellation will keep a close eye on wildfires. When fully operational, the constellation’s more than 50 satellites will be able to image nearly all of Earth’s surface once every 20 minutes. The initial phase will consist of just three satellites, and it will revisit every point on the globe twice per day when it’s operational in 2026. The first satellite was built by Muon Space and launched aboard SpaceX’s Transporter 13 mission on March 14 from Vandenberg Space Force Base. The sensor suite consists of six-band multispectral infrared cameras, which are tuned to detect wildfires from a distance. Most wildfire tracking today uses aerial photography via airplanes or low-resolution satellite imagery that’s been repurposed for the task. The former is expensive, limiting how frequently it can be updated, while the latter suffers from low resolution and sensors not specifically tuned to wildfire detection. The FireSate constellation is designed to solve both of those problems. Its produces five-meter resolution imagery, and when the constellation is flying its full complement, it’ll provide firefighters with near real-time updates on a fire’s whereabouts and behavior.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

TikTok is introducing a new “Security Checkup” tool that allows users to quickly review and update their account’s security settings from a single screen, the company announced on Monday. The feature is similar to Security Checkup tools offered by TikTok rival Instagram and tech giant Google. Security Checkup offers users a step-by-step guide through the social network’s security features. The tool encourages users to enable more security features to make their accounts safer. Users can link their phone number and email address to the app to ensure that they have a backup login method in case they lose access to their account. Users can also enable two-step verification to add an extra layer of security when they access their account from an unfamiliar device. In addition, Security Checkup stresses the importance of regularly checking to see which devices are logged into the account and to remove any that are no longer in use or that the user doesn’t recognize. The tool will also suggest that users enable device-based authentication methods like Face ID or Touch Unlock for a secure and fast login experience. TikTok notes that it proactively monitors for unusual behavior and flags it in the “Security and permissions” settings for users to review. Despite the uncertainty, the company has been continuously updating its app with new features, like new teen safety features, along with an updated desktop experience designed to take on YouTube.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Security researchers have observed hackers linked to the notorious LockBit gang exploiting a pair of Fortinet firewall vulnerabilities to deploy ransomware on several company networks. In a report published last week, security researchers at Forescout Research said a group it’s tracking dubbed “Mora_001” is exploiting the Fortinet firewalls, which sit on the edge of a company’s network and act as digital gatekeepers, to break in and deploy a custom ransomware strain they call “SuperBlack.” One of the vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2024-55591, has been exploited in cyberattacks to breach the corporate networks of Fortinet customers since December 2024. Forescout says a second bug, tracked as CVE-2025-24472, is also being exploited by Mora_001 in attacks. Sai Molige, senior manager of threat hunting at Forescout, told TechCrunch that the cybersecurity firm has “investigated three events in different companies, but we believe there could be others.” In one confirmed intrusion, Forescout said it observed the attacker “selectively” encrypting file servers containing sensitive data. “The encryption was initiated only after data exfiltration, aligning with recent trends among ransomware operators who prioritize data theft over pure disruption,” said Molige. “This connection could indicate that Mora_001 is either a current affiliate with unique operational methods or an associate group sharing communication channels,” Molige said. Stefan Hostetler, head of threat intelligence at cybersecurity firm Arctic Wolf, which previously observed exploitation of CVE-2024-55591, tells TechCrunch that Forescout’s findings suggest hackers are “going after the remaining organizations who were unable to apply the patch or harden their firewall configurations when the vulnerability was originally disclosed.” Hostetler says the ransom note used in these attacks bears similarities to that of other groups, such as the now-defunct ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware gang.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bumble is finally catching up with competitor Tinder with a new ID verification feature as dating app users urge for more safety measures. In addition to ID verification, the company also released three more features, including a feature that flags inappropriate messages in chat before users hit send and the ability to share date details with friends. Bumble also launched a “Discover” page dedicated to helping users find matches with similar interests. Bumble’s ID verification badge comes as AI makes it harder to figure out which dating profiles are real or fake. Rival Tinder expanded its identity verification program last year to the U.S., U.K., Brazil, and Mexico. Additionally, a new “Share Date” feature allows Bumble users to share their date details — such as the person they’re meeting, the time, and location — with people they trust. If plans change, they can update their friends directly in the app. Tinder launched a “Share My Date” feature in April 2024. Another feature focused on safety, “Review Before You Send,” targets the messaging section, where users frequently encounter inappropriate messages. Similar to Tinder’s “Explore” page, users can explore different categories to find people with shared dating intentions, similar interests, and communities.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In Brief

As duties under the U.K.’s Online Safety Act (OSA) related to tackling illegal content came into force Monday, the internet watchdog, Ofcom, said it has launched a new enforcement program focused on online storage and file-sharing services.

The regulator said its evidence shows that file-sharing and file-storage services are “particularly susceptible” to being used for the sharing of image-based child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The enforcement programme will assess safety measures they put in place that are aimed at preventing offenders from disseminating CSAM on their services.

Ofcom added that it has written to “a number” of these services, without naming any of those involved. It has put them on notice that “formal information requests” will soon be sent regarding the measures they have already implemented or plan to implement to tackle CSAM. It will ask them to submit illegal harm risk assessments.

Failure to comply with the OSA could lead to major penalties — of up to 10% of global annual turnover.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

It’s only been around six months since Snap released the fifth generation of Spectacles, its AR glasses for developers, and the company is already enhancing its latest pair with new Lenses and platform features. Snap announced on Monday that it’s launching the ability to create Spectacles-focused Lenses that tap GPS, new hand-tracking capabilities, and more. Now, developers can build Lenses using GPS, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), compass heading, and custom locations, allowing them to access geo-location data and create things like AR walking courses. The update is primarily aimed at improving location-based experiences on Spectacles. Snap showcased a few examples that utilize the new capabilities, such as NavigatAR from Utopia Labs, which directs users with Snap Map Tiles by displaying glowing arrows to assist wearers in reaching their destinations. Other new platform features for Spectacles include the aforementioned hand-tracking capabilities, which detect grab gestures and when a user has a phone in their hands. Snap also now lets developers easily add a leaderboard to their Lenses for competition-focused experiences. Spectacles are currently accessible only through Snap’s developer program, which costs $99 per month. However, Snap recently introduced a 50% discount for educators and students, indicating that its long-term goal is to bring AR experiences to the masses while also helping it compete with tech giants like Apple, Google, and Meta. Alongside today’s announcement, Snap unveiled a series of challenges that will award $20,000 to Spectacles-owning developers who create the top 10 best Lenses each month.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/17/openai-to-start-testing-chatgpt-connectors-for-google-drive-and-slack/'>OpenAI to start testing ChatGPT connectors for Google Drive and Slack</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techcrunch&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 00:00:00 <p>
“This will allow employees using ChatGPT to easily make use of internal information similar to how they can use world knowledge via web search,” reads the document. ChatGPT Connectors could convince wary company executives to change their position — and present a formidable challenge to AI-powered enterprise search platforms like Glean. ChatGPT Connectors, which is launching in beta for select ChatGPT Team users, is powered by a version of OpenAI’s GPT-4o model that can refine its responses based on “internal [company] knowledge,” according to the document. The custom GPT-4o model searches and “reads” internal information possibly relevant to a query. To create a search index, OpenAI syncs an encrypted copy of company files and conversations on ChatGPT’s servers, per the document. “When appropriate, the model will directly respond with a list of relevant results.” Perhaps to assure customers that ChatGPT won’t leak their private data, the document highlights that Slack and Google Drive permissions are “fully respected” and “kept continuously up to date.” For example, ChatGPT Connector syncs Slack private channel memberships and Drive file permissions as well as directory information. Employees won’t be able to discover content via ChatGPT that they can’t access in Google Drive or Slack, according to the OpenAI document, and admins will have the ability to choose which Slack channels and Google Drive files are synced. There are technical limits to what ChatGPT Connector can access, as well. Images in Google Drive files (e.g. Google Docs, Google Slides, PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and plain text) aren’t supported, according to the document, which noted that ChatGPT Connector can only “read” — not analyze — data in Sheets and Excel workbooks. Companies that wish to participate in the ChatGPT Connector beta are being asked to provide OpenAI with 100 documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and/or Slack channel conversations. “No data synced from Google Drive or Slack will be used for training,” the document reads.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
