Bruno Mars is one of the few figures in pop nearly everyone can agree on. He’s mastered mass appeal with easy-to-enjoy songs, undisputed vocal talent, and overflowing charisma. His four-quadrant, feel-good R&B hits — among them “Just the Way You Are,” “Uptown Funk!”, “That’s What I Like,” and Silk Sonic’s “Leave the Door Open” — are like nice watches: always reliable, stylish yet classic.

But the past six months have exceeded even Mars’s standards, which already included multiple Diamond-selling singles, three Record of the Year Grammys, and one of the longest-running No. 1s in Hot 100 history. His 2024 duet with Lady Gaga, “Die With a Smile,” has been the top-streamed song on Spotify for a record 148 non-consecutive days and counting. It also debuted atop the Billboard Global 200 chart and stayed for eight weeks — only to be interrupted by another Mars duet, “APT.,” with Blackpink’s Rosé. That song allowed Mars to conquer Asia’s often-siloed markets — earning his first No. 1s in South Korea and Japan — and broke the record for most weeks atop the Global Excl. U.S. chart. Between both tracks, Mars closed 2024 as the top artist on the Global 200. By November, he had become Spotify’s top-streamed artist for the first time, dethroning the Weeknd.

The most surprising aspect of Mars’s latest career boost is how counterintuitive his approach has been. On “Smile” and “APT.,” we hear less of him than ever. Rather than putting Mars in the spotlight with his tried-and-true throwback formula, these songs take the lead of their collaborators: “Smile” is a vintage rock ballad recalling Gaga’s late 2010s work on Joanne and A Star Is Born, while “APT.” is a K-pop track interpolating Toni Basil’s “Mickey.” A funk-inflected rap song like Mars’s latest single, “Fat Juicy & Wet,” is more well-trod territory for him, but even there, Sexyy Red is the raunchy ringleader.

What isn’t new for Mars is having a collaborative streak. We may think of him as a front-and-center showman, dancing, belting, and cheesing it up for the cameras. But Mars has prized teamwork throughout his career. He got his start in the production group the Smeezingtons, working with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine to shepherd hits by Flo Rida and Cee Lo Green. Mars’s breakout as a singer came from singing the hook on songs for rappers B.o.B. and Travie McCoy. His biggest hit, “Uptown Funk!”, was for someone else’s album. Even recently, he chose to follow the runaway success of 24K Magic by working with his friend Anderson .Paak in Silk Sonic.

Bankable stars didn’t always need to collaborate with their peers to succeed. But as streaming continues to segment music consumption, the biggest artists are expanding their footprints by working with artists outside their genre, to get on more playlists and make their songs feel like marquee events. Mars’s own collaborator Lady Gaga has found considerable success on this path. Even Taylor Swift has been collaborating more widely than ever, featuring multiple guests on her recent albums and re-recorded vault tracks. But these team-ups can feel forced or calculated, like Swift’s “Karma” remix with Ice Spice, where the rapper sounded completely out of place. Mars’s collaborations have been the opposite. He’s game to sing in Korean on “APT.” or to commit to Gaga’s bit by covering “California Dreamin’” at the Grammys.

We’ve seen singers use duets to saturate the market as recently as last year, when Post Malone had features on Beyoncé and Swift’s albums, along with his own No. 1 country song, “I Had Some Help,” with Morgan Wallen. But those songs weren’t so disparate from Post’s usual output — Beyoncé’s “Levii’s Jeans” was another straight-up country song in line with his (and her) recent genre pivot, while Swift’s “Fortnight” fell in line with Malone’s pop ballads. That makes Mars’s feat both improbable and impressive. He managed to pull off two completely different-sounding hits: an adult-contemporary rock anthem and a peppy K-pop drinking song. But it’s also a challenge built for Mars. Everything he does look smooth, and that hasn’t stopped yet.",vulture

Is been Four year's since Torrey Peters published her critically acclaimed debut, detrition, baby. That Book Was, By Design, A Conventional Literary Novel, One That Explored Questions of Transition Through a Clever, and Ultimatelly Brutal, Reimagining of the Marriage plot. Peters's New Book, Stag Dance, Feels Like A Radical Departure From That Approach-And In A Way, A Radical Return to It, SINCE THE THREE STORES COLLECTED ALONGSIDE THE TITULAR NEW NOVEL WERE WERE Originally Self-Public. The Book's Cast Includes Boarding-School Jocks, Fetishists in Full-Body Rubber Suits, Lonely Lumberjacks Going Courting in the Depths of Winter. What it does not include, for the most part, is actual trans people, in the modern, Glaad-Approved Sense. This is a bit of genius. Peters has discovered a Great Secret That Eludes Many Marginalized Writers, Obscured from Them by Publishers, Critics, and the Pall Of Their Own Anxiety: Sometimes the Best Way to Write About Your Experience is to Stop Assuming You Know What Your Exper I recently spoke with Peters at her book launch at the beach in New York, where she delved into her new experiments with style, The Limitations of the Trans-Cis Binary, and What Old-Timey Loggers Called Chewing Tobacco.

Torrey Peters: My First Public Interaction with You, Andrea, was a little bit of a tiff. Harron Walker Wrote a Profile of Me and in the Course of Talking To Me, I did not Understand the Concept of ""On the Record."" At the time, Andrea's incredible essay ""on Liking Women"" had just come out, and I was probly a bit jealous. I was like, this young upstart wrote a better essay than me. In Started Complaining About it, and it was all on the record. And then Harron published it. Not only did she publish it, but being a good reporter, she called Andrea and Said, “This is what Torrey Said about you. What do you think about that? ”

Andrea responded very eloquently and I think correctly. I stewed about it. I was like, I know who Andrea thinks she is to talk back to me. I have self-pubished one novella! And then I was like, going to show her you can't talk to me that way. But it was a period in my life where I was having a breakup, so I got distracted. And slowly, Andrea Started Writing More and More Pieces. I was like, well, three are pretty good pieces. SOON SHE WON A PULITZER. And I was like, Thank good in got distracted.

But on Always Been Curious What would've Happened Had I Actually roof on Andrea Long Chu. So I was think you should start out by showing me a little bit of what you got. Just roast me for a bit. Show me what I was missing.

Just Roast You?

Just Lay Into Me!

In Mean, I don't want to roast you. You Clearly have a big presentation in the morning. You look like you really scored at women's warehouse.

In did, in did.

I do want to know, if you are here, who is working security at Dylan Mulvaney's Book Launch?

Come on. I can take it.

You look like the surprise guest at a Business-Casual Gender-Reveal Party.

Is a boy.

Okay. Okay. That's Enough…

So so happy that was a review of my suit and not my book.

The Book is genuinely so, so good - seriously. And I don't have that Opinion about a lot of things. Not even as a critic, just as a reader. It was Honestly So Great to Read. Let's do talk about the book. I have all these questions about time and temporality, but the most surface-level version of that is: there is new stuff, and there's old stuff in this collection. DO WONDERING HOW IT ALL CAME TARETHER AND WHAT IT'S LIKE HAVE MATERIAL THAT PREDATES DetRansition, Baby Sitting Alongside The New Stuff.

The First Piece in the Collection is Called Infect Your Friends and Loved Ones, Which I Originally Self-Pubished in 2015. And it was a little funny to go back to it, because the energy at the time was was sort of punk. It was like, well, The Publishing Industry is not going to publish my work. I don't care. Just going to self-Publish. And so, The Original Publication was Full of Typos. There Were Sentences that did not totally work. At the time I was like, I want that. I Wanted People to Pick Up This Book and Say, “You don't need an IMMACULATE PAGE IN ORDER TO Move Readers. You just need the energy. "" And so it was funny to look at it in the context of this book. In thought that I would rewrite and update it, but when I found it, I was like, ""I can not capture that Energy Anymore."" Not the person who was willing to take risks. Not the person who is willing to leave mistakes on the page just to make a point. And so, I was like, I Actually Can't Edit This.

And then Stag Dance, The Main Story in the Book, Is Complely Written in This Weird Lumberjack Slang. The story of a bunch of loggers, who would work these long winter camps and, when they got lonely, they'd put on a dance, and some of the men would dance as women. They would cut out a little brown Fabric Triangle and they Paste the triangle upside down over their crotch. Anyone who showed up with that little triangle played the role of a woman and danced with all of the other men in these isolated camps in the west. And they actually did this everywhere; Soldiers Did It, Railroad Workers Did It, Miners Did It - It was Fairly Common in the West.

But in some way that narrative was a reaction to detrrans, baby. There was so much pressure. It was like, “you wrote this comedy of manners. How are you going to follow it up? ” And I was like, “You know what no one wants? A Logger Dance Discussing the Various Ways to Cut Down a Tree. "" And in a weird way, that totally freed me. I could say whatever in Wanted. I got to reinvent a lot of what I was feeling in the Logger Language. And so it seat strange with infect your friends and loved ones, but for me, that resonance produced something really interesting.

There is a kind of tenderness to the voice in stag dance; The Narrator, Babe Bunyan, Repeats Certain Phrase and Offers these little Clarifications to the Reader. Part of What You Experience Reading It is, like, ""Who Talks like this?"" And that is, for my money, a better representation of the trans experience than just, like, here are some trans characters talking to each other about being trans. One of the things in would be interesting in hearing you talk about is, one, the decision to write about non-trans or SLIGHTLY trans characters but also the decision to explore these strange genre places, wheres more about litt bits of Language and Feel.

Part of it was that the Language was so unfamiliar. I found this dictionary of Logger Slang from 1941 that was compiled by the Children of Loggers. An egg is a cackleberry; Chewing Tobacco is Scandihoovian Dynamite. And I was like, I just Want to Write these weird words.

In a lot of way, trying to write about the feelings that I have in these words made the feelings new to me. A phrase like gender dysphoria, when I say it now, Feels so overdemined. Just clunks. Babe Bunyan, in the novel, Says, ""Mirrors do not and litigate me."" I was like, that is how it feels. And I would never have said that if I was not pretending to be a logger to myself.

Very Interested in Having My Characters Not Know Things. Partly because of the time; Babe Bunyan Can't Know Anything. But Also for Instance, The Second Story, ""The Chaser,"" Takes Place at a Boarding School. And in that story there's a kind of soccer-playing-bridge type, who starts hooking up with his roommate, who's femme. And neither one of them know exactly what's going on. If you know me as an Author, you would probly say, “All right, this robbie character is probly a pre-transition trans girl,“ But the character don't know that. And so it opens up a whole thing. For me, Oftentimes Transness is about knowing things about what's going on with your feelings.

It is something that comes through with a number of different characters in the book. I think you have said that you are less interesting in the binary between and women and more interesting in the binary between whatever a trans person is and what cis person is - that a cis woman who like pretty dresses in her 20s, and work in her 50 Non-Trivial Way. It seems like a lot of what the book is trying to do, in my mind, is create a kind of space for freedom between the present, five years from now, ten years from now, and also five minutes from now - that gender is something to have been life.

In the story the masks, there's a sissy who's into online sissy culture and she goes to vegas, where two people want to take her under their wings. One is a trans woman, Who's Probably Very Into Respectability Politics and the “Corract” Way to be a woman. And the other person is totally on the fetishist level; He Wears A Full-Body Silicone Woman Suit. And that person, in think, husband, a very compelling case for doing it his way, which is basic, like, he's a doctor and he gets to go dress up and have great, wild, fetishistic sex, then go back to bector and being respected. His way of doing things is cheek of appealing - Keep Everything and have Great Sex. WHO WOULDN'T WANT IT? And meanwhile, this idea that you have to transition and you have to tell everybody that you do this thing - it did not look that appealing in the story. And I think there is this open question of what the sissy will choose: The fetishist could be the future, could be the past. The Life of A Trans Woman Could Be The Future, Could Be The Past. And that moment of inderminacy in time is something that really interesting me.

Well, part of the reason that something like that is important is that we do not know who is trans. And the Attempt to give a boundary to that, we are learning, is not actually a good thing. Is an extremely bad and dangerous thing. We're Already Seeing the Weaponization of Certainty Against Trans People. But then the question becomes, ""If community can be found in a group of people, then how do you think about it?"" How do you constitute that kind of thing? Is it more of an ethic or a sensitivity or a way of being?

Something Trying to Do is See Trans Less as an Identity and More of an Invitation. And a lot of these stories are invitations to a reader to identify with these characters who are probly not like them. Is about Taking Away The Markers of What It Means to Be Trans, and Instead Looking at the Emotional Building Blocks of This Experience, which are often Pretty Universal Things, Like the Difference Between How You're Seen and How You Want To Be Seen.

All the things that the soccer bro in the chaser is experiencing are actually the same things that the trans character is experience - a fear of “what am in going to lose if in husband this decision? What's The Difference Between How People Want to See Me and How I Want to Be Seen? ” So I think the way I want to approach ethics and politics is through the door of emotion, where people can be like, ""oh yeah, in kind of get that."" Then they have the abilities to THINK THROUGH AND DISCER all kinds of stuff, because they feld something first. Four Characters in the book actively identify as trans and the rest are just people going through weird feelings, which is all of us, which means that there's an affinity and a solidarity for all of us who have weird feeling.

And notable, I think at the Least Three of the Four Actively Trans-Identifying Characters Sort of Won Not Shut Up About It. They are constantly trying to assert a sense of what it means that they are trans. There is something particular about the kind of identity formation that is involved that Kind of Act of will or Language. Then when we're think about these sort of limal characters who may never even cross the threshold into transness, there is this sense that is something, inso as it exist, just exists in their heads. So, there's a problem. On the one hand, you want it to feel intuitive. On the other, there's such a demand to intellectualize it or make it available through Language. I have no idea what the resolution between these things is, but there is a particular kind of problems in the trans case, in that asserting consciousness is part of the identity.

In Kind of Feel Like the Party Line Around Trans Stuff is, like, you Declare Yourself a Thing, you come up with a Language for it, then you are that thing. But in fact, what babe bunyan runs into - which I feld very free to do in logger slang, and which feld more fraught to approach in contemporary language - is that declaring one's gene ends up bee a negotiation with all these peoples. And that because is a negotiation with all these people around you, not the same for every single person. And that Depending on How Much Money You Have, The Body You Were Born With, How You Were Raised, One Person's Transition May Be Much Easier.

The Idea That Language is all that you need to do this actually produced a lot of misery for people, because if the idea is you decate that you are trans and everybody goes, ""Yeah, that's great, thy, you have,"" Then you walk throgh lif. “Well, I did it. I have the Language, I have this thing, and yet I am Constantly Rejected. "" And I think that is unfair, and really hard to talk about, because it produces jealousies even within the trans community. And that's not something like like I could talk about in a contemporary sort of story, but I Could Create a Mythic Lumberjack Who Can Talk About that Kind of Stuff and Be Frustrated Over That Unfairness. And for me, the fact that you are constantly negotiating with people who no negotiating on the same term or language is one of the most frustrating things about my experience - but is also the experience of anybody.",vulture
https://vulture.com,‘Black Bag’ Director Steven Soderbergh’s Secret Ingredient,https://www.vulture.com/article/black-bag-director-steven-soderberghs-secret-ingredient.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 07:00:11 GMT","Photo: Claudette Barius/Focus Features

Steven Soderbergh’s work ethic is so legendary that there’s a joke about it: “In the time it took me to say this, he made another movie.”

Since his feature-filmmaking debut 36 years ago with sex, lies and videotape, Soderbergh has has worked on 33 movies and eight TV series as a director and another 41 as a producer and been one of a handful of directors in Oscars history to be nominated for Best Picture and Director in the same calendar year (in 2001, for Erin Brockovich and Traffic; the latter won in both categories). This year is already shaping up to be a productivity all-timer. He’s released two films as director in seven weeks: the ghost story Presence, which opened in January, and Black Bag, an espionage drama about two married spies (Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender) that opened Friday. When I asked him a week ago what movie would be next, he said, “We just wrapped one on Thursday.” That would be The Christophers, “a dark comedy about the estranged children of a once-famous artist who hire a forger to complete his unfinished works so they can be discovered and sold after his death.” He hopes to premiere it this fall.

Soderbergh is also remarkable for his creative restlessness. In every project where he’s a hands-on filmmaker, he tries to create not just another IMDB credit but a challenge. He loves unconventional casting (he built The Girlfriend Experience around porn star Sasha Grey, Haywire around mixed martial artist Gina Carano, and Bubble around a group of Ohio factory workers) and lives to subvert genre expectations (Presence is a ghost story told from the point of view of a ghost, while Black Bag is a dialogue-driven spy thriller with almost no violence, focusing on a marriage). He was one of the earliest A-list filmmakers to embrace video over film (Full Frontal was his first, shot with a low-resolution “prosumer” camera) and he’s been a high-profile beta tester for new digital cameras ever since (his 2008 biopic Che was the first feature shot with the Red One camera, which immediately became an industry standard). Sometimes Soderbergh sets very tight parameters for production, mainly because he’s curious to see the result: every scene in Presence is done in one take, while his 2003 HBO political series K Street consists of 10 episodes that were conceived, shot, edited, and premiered within seven-day spans.

And although Soderbergh is not opposed to using multiple cameras to shoot a scene, especially ones with stunts or lots of performers, he prefers to work solo, operating his own camera (usually handheld) and trying to see how much information he can pack into a shot without needing to cut to something else, because he likes being close to the actors and doesn’t want to make extra work for his editor (Steven Soderbergh). “My default mode is to try to ask myself, how few shots can I do this in?” he says. “It’s a process of distillation.”

In one of the other times that we’ve talked, you said that for you, the pleasures of filmmaking were “in the process.” What are the process pleasures of Black Bag?

It was great to come off something like Presence, in which the editing is restricted to stringing together single shots with a little bit of black in between, and return to a more editorially complex, montage-friendly story — and, in this case, sequences that required a really granular approach to the shots and the editing: two dinner-table scenes.

I was going to ask you about those. I’ve heard that any scene with a lot of characters around a table is a logistical nightmare to shoot, and you have two long ones.

I was saying to somebody the other day, no screenwriting class or book would advise you to put two 12-page dinner-table scenes in your script — and more than that! — so that you kind of end up thinking about them as the action sequences of the film. Which they are: I really had to think of them like that. And that meant they needed the same kind of visual attention and thought that you would give to a traditional action sequence. I thought that there had to be a way to keep this interesting for the audience and develop strategies visually so that there could be an escalation in each scene that matched the gear shifts indicated in the text, but not in a way that was distracting or annoying to the audience. The goal was to create versions of those dinner-table scenes that — contrary to what is typical when you talk about ten-to-12-page dialogue scenes — would make people immediately go, Can I watch that scene again? Right now?

Your first feature, sex, lies and videotape had a number of very important scenes unfolding around tables. And, like Black Bag, it was focused on relationships and sexual honesty.

You can absolutely draw a thematic line from that first film to this film. I’m still interested in people in rooms, talking. I’m still convinced this is where events begin. Big events, small events: two people in a room is usually how they start, and so I’m endlessly fascinated by it and not scared of it.

There was a project at one point that was notoriously unmade, and remains notoriously unmade, that was pretty much a person in a hotel room for the whole movie. I was speaking to the actor that was involved in developing it. He said, “Are you worried that the whole movie is just set in this hotel suite with this one character?” I said, “It’s not a problem for me.” I didn’t get the job, but the thing never got made, so … [Shrugs.] Well!

And of course you’ve done a filmed stage monologue, Spalding Gray’s Gray’s Anatomy, which was essentially that sort of movie.

Yes. It’s all in the process. How do you shoot it, you know? And while you’re trying to come up with ways to keep it from being predictable visually as you shoot it, you also have to be secure in the text and in the actors, because at the end of the day, if the script is good and you cast it properly, it should work, so you don’t want to overdo it and start creating visual tricks because you’re insecure that people are going to get bored. Right?

Speaking of text: I wanted to talk to you about your collaborations with screenwriter David Koepp, with whom you’ve done four features. Like you, he seems to enjoy working in every genre. This one seems like a throwback to other films he’s been involved in, notably the first Mission: Impossible, though of course that was a very different kind of spy movie. Whose idea was Black Bag?

It was David’s idea. He’d been noodling with this idea for a while, and we’d been talking about it for a while: making something like Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf. I kept harping on it and prodding him for years to essentially write his own version of that play. And I think what he ended up doing was adding that notion to something he was already working on. Finally, during Presence, David said, “I think I have that time, and I think I figured it out, and now I’m going to sit down and really write this.” We would keep in touch. In one of our conversations, I said, “How’s it going?” And David said, “It’s going great! I wrote a 12-page dinner scene today.” And I said, “Well, God help the person who’s got to direct that.” And then, three months later, I was that person — and there were two dinner-table scenes!

Before this interview I rewatched your 1996 experimental feature Schizopolis. In that movie, there are three principal actors, each of whom plays two characters. One of the actors is you. It’s your only lead performance. You’ve got doppelgängers all over the place in that movie, and tons of deception, and it reminded me that deception in your work is intertwined with performance and/or acting, whether the project is Black Bag, sex, lies and videotape, Schizopolis, Out of Sight, The Girlfriend Experience, The Informant! or even Ocean’s 12, in which Julia Roberts’s character impersonates Julia Roberts.

[Laughs.] Right.

All of that made me think back to another one of our conversations, where you talked about what an important developmental milestone it was to become your own cinematographer, as well as camera operator, and dive into scenes with the cast. So I wonder: Isn’t every Steven Soderbergh movie Schizopolis? Like, you’re still acting, but you’re acting behind the camera, with the camera, through the camera? And is it possible that you’re sort of performing a heist movie, an espionage movie, a ghost story?

Yeah, absolutely. What you just said makes me think of two things. One is the fact that most conflict has its source in some form of betrayal, whether it’s an interpersonal betrayal, an ideological betrayal. The drama begins when some understanding is fractured: an understanding between two people or two companies, or between an institution and a person within an institution. There’s been some contract, whether spoken or unspoken, and it’s been violated, and this is what is creating the drama. And so betrayal, to me, is a real core for a story, a foundation for almost any conflict that you can imagine.

The other thing you’ve made me think of is the performative aspect of our lives — the fact that we all indulge, I think, in presenting a version of ourselves to the world that we want to align with our idea of ourselves. When you combine that with the ultimate and very frustrating unknowability of another person — the fact that, try as you might, and as much time as you may spend with someone, another person is ultimately unknowable to you — it’s a really scary prospect, at least if you’re invested in any serious way.

I do know this: The first family that lived in a cave, when they saw the second family that lived in a cave, started discussing why the other family’s cave was bigger.

But at the same time, I think it’s very necessary for each of us to retain a part of ourselves that is just for ourselves and believe that there’s nothing inherently wrong with that. I mean, of course there are bad versions of that, but I also want aspects of my life that are mine, something that’s just my own. I respect that in other people. For instance, there’s no scenario in which I would ever snoop through my wife’s laptop, phone, journal, or what have you. I would never in a million years do that. I want her to have something that belongs to her, that she doesn’t have to share with me. I don’t have a big belief in that kind of privacy where you have to share everything.

You just made me think of the classic moment in The Limey when Luis Guzmán and Terence Stamp are at the party at Peter Fonda’s mansion, standing on a pool that extends out into a canyon like a precipice, and Stamp says, “What are we standing on?” and Guzmán says, “Trust.”

Exactly, yeah! Trust. Trust is important and necessary to have in order to maintain some kind of order to our lives, and in our society. But the bottom line is people lie. There’s a line from the movie version of Graham Greene’s Fallen Idol where the kid asks Ralph Richardson why people lie, and he says, “Well, it’s because they want something and they think telling the truth won’t get it for them.” This is all around us!

Even in a pandemic thriller like Contagion, trust is integral to the story, not just at an institutional level, but a personal one: If you think you might have a contagious disease, you’re supposed to tell somebody.

Yeah, yeah — and that’s exactly what happened to a friend of mine recently. It’s still happening, I think, with COVID, even though it’s now been kind of integrated into our lives five years after the start of the pandemic. I still know people who are having these debates with themselves and with other people now: Do I have to tell somebody whether I feel sick? I think most people now, when they start to feel something that feels like it might be COVID, are not immediately running out and getting COVID tests.

Right. A lot of them are telling themselves, Oh, it’s probably just a cold because confirming it’s COVID means they’d have to miss work and lose money.

I think that’s right. It’s a human thing, unfortunately. The development of language allowed that sort of deception to flourish. Before humans could talk, I think it was a lot harder to pull off a lie. Once we started talking, language was the fuel that let us really start making shit up.

You’ve just made me envision a movie about cave people trying to lie to each other without language. What would that look like?

I don’t know, but I do know this: The first family that lived in a cave, when they saw the second family that lived in a cave, started discussing why the other family’s cave was bigger.

I’m very interested in the fact that we’re still unable to pinpoint the exact time when the part of our brain that creates and processes language came about, and why it came about. Was it a random mutation? Was it diet related, because we started eating different things? We still don’t know exactly when this phase transition took place. I read somewhere that at some point, a couple hundred thousand years ago, a version of us emerged that’s more or less what we think of as “ourselves” now. I’m talking about the versions of humanoid creatures that would eventually turn into Homo sapiens: At one point it was determined, by tracing DNA back, that this group consisted of about 3,000 people. It’s ridiculous how small that number is. Three thousand people! That’s how close we came to not being able to have this Zoom call.

Human civilization was a rounding error?

Oh, completely. It’s wild to think that we came that close to not being us. But I wonder, you know, is there another version of a renaissance in our thinking, in our behavior, to be had? Or is this it? We kind of tapped out in terms of our ability to improve ourselves and stop killing each other at an increasingly rapid clip. We clearly indulge, and have always indulged, in a fantasy that a new piece of technology is going to save us or provide a moment of transcendence, and it never works out that way. What ends up happening is we very rapidly figure out the worst possible use for a new piece of technology. Bad ideas scale faster than good ideas.

Severus, the top-secret device that drives the action in Black Bag, is a perfect example of what you’re talking about.

Yes. And it’s also kind of the MacGuffin of the movie — a Trojan horse for David to explore what he really wanted to explore, which is what happens if you are in a relationship in which part of the construct is a “Get Out of Jail Free” card that you can wield at any moment.

Right. The idea that in espionage, there are unsavory but officially sanctioned things, including having sex with a target to make your cover story convincing, that you can’t tell your partner about, and they have to be okay with it, and they also have to trust that when you engage in that kind of activity you’re “working,” as opposed to stepping out on your partner.

And how does that arrangement work? Can it work? Also interesting: There’s a successful marriage in this milieu, George and Kathryn. That fact is annoying to other people in their world, to such an extent that the happy couple becomes a target for being framed. I thought that it was fascinating that people in this world could be activated by their envy of that kind of relationship and moved to do some really unsavory things in order to sabotage it.

Back to the idea of a betrayal as the inciting incident of a story: In the very first scene, George’s colleague Meachum (played by Gustaf Skarsgård) warns George that his wife might be part of a group of traitorous moles within the agency. This piece of information is delivered in a nightclub, a Dionysian space where the whole point is to lose your inhibitions.

Oh, absolutely. I liked that idea. But the movie used to open differently. It used to open with George and Meachum on a bench near the Thames. It was a more traditional “spies meet on a bench” scene. But by the time we got to the wrap party for the shoot, I was already pitching David a different version of that opening scene that would feel a little less genteel, and that would also play directly to the theme of the movie: What if George has to go fish this guy out of a club where he shouldn’t be hanging out in order to get this information that he needs about a possible mole within the agency? And David immediately sparked to that. He said, “Oh, that makes much more sense. It’s more interesting visually, and it does play right to the core of the movie, which is that this guy [Meachum] is really taking advantage of the lacuna that they’ve all agreed exists in these relationships.”

A new opening like that is the result of being able to see scenes, and the movie itself, very, very quickly, either while we’re shooting or shortly after we finish shooting, so that I can immediately put into play anything that needs to be redone or any new material that needs to be shot. We were recalibrating and reshooting things while we were shooting. We ended up doing two days of additional photography — spread out over a couple months, because of actors’ schedules — to really go after story -clarification points, because in a movie like this, the way in which you release information to the audience is everything. You’ve got to maintain this balance where they’re kind of reaching for it and it feels like they can grab it, but they can’t quite. If it’s too far away and feel like they can’t reach it at all, they get frustrated and tap out. And if they’re ahead of you, that’s a disaster, right?

So there were a couple scenes that we went back and sort of reworked to either add some information that we thought was critical at that point or remove a piece of information that we felt was tipping our hand too early. It was only through screening the film for people, whether it’s for friends or at two test screenings with strangers, that you can figure this stuff out, because it’s really hard to predict what information will land and what won’t.

Luckily, you as a storyteller have your own “Get Out of Jail Free” card, which is: If the audience can see where the movie is going in a general sense, it’s okay, as long as they can’t predict the exact path.

Yeah — it’s got to be that combination of surprising and inevitable, right? It has to make sense, but they shouldn’t be able to fully predict what’s going to happen or how. This is something that David’s very good at.

Since we’re talking about your collaboration with David Koepp, I wanted to jump over to Presence. That film also has a direct connection with Schizopolis in that you’re the lead actor. Only this time, we never see your face or hear your voice. How are the choices you make in a unique situation like Presence different from the choices you would make when you’re shooting something that is, I guess you would say, third person, such as Black Bag?

I’m used to having, obviously, a fairly intimate relationship with my cast, because it’s me operating the camera. But Presence was next level in terms of my physical relationship to them. It was real choreography. I was aware of the fact that the audience’s ability to understand what’s happening is built upon the choices that the presence makes, as far as what to look at and when. That’s how we’re learning what it wants. That’s one of the two questions you’re asking yourself while you’re watching the film: Who is it, and what does it want? And I’m trying to keep giving you some answers to those questions by what I’m choosing to look at and what I’m choosing to emphasize.

That was a really fun challenge that was new to me as a director. I had a level of performance anxiety as the director and the camera operator that I’d never had before, because, given the professional skill set of the cast, if there was a take that was no good, it was because I made a mistake, not them. And that would happen, especially on some of the longer takes. The most common mistake was me predicting or anticipating movement on the part of an actor in a way that, if you didn’t actually know they were going to make that move, you would have reacted differently. I’m specifically talking about the lag time in a pan when an actor moves from one place to another. There were a couple takes that I ruined because your natural instincts as a camera operator are to anticipate a movement and try to keep the composition perfect.

And be in the right spot before it happens?

Yeah. And there were times where I went, “Fuck — I forgot that I gotta build in the lag that comes with not knowing what’s happening.” That was a common occurrence.

And I guess that’s just acting, right?

Exactly. But it was a new sensation for me. And then there was also the fear of falling on those stairs, which were very serious stairs! But it was exhilarating in the sense that there was no Plan B. My belief that it would work was based on the fact that I knew every other approach would have been worse — that there was no other way to put this idea across; that it has to be this way.

You once told me that a continuous, first-person viewpoint, which drives virtual reality experiences and a lot of videogames, is at cross-purposes with the idea of visual storytelling, because you need to understand how a character is reacting to events. How did you justify the continuous first-person in Presence, then?

When I see first person [filming techniques], in which we’re aware that this perspective is supposed to represent a human being in the corporeal world that is seeing all this stuff, I feel like there’s a primal desire to see a reverse angle and look into the eyes of the character who’s experiencing the story. That’s a very strong impulse, and it’s why, whenever I watch material that’s done in that fashion, after a certain point I start to disengage, because I don’t feel connected to the lead character or characters who are experiencing the events. I felt that problem would be mitigated in Presence because this was a character who wasn’t visible to us, and that meant there was nothing to cut to. You didn’t have the desire to see a reverse angle of the character’s face, because you knew there was nothing there.

That’s still a big departure for you. You’ve got some very effective first person shots in your movies, but they never go unanswered by reverse shots of the character who’s doing the looking. In The Limey, which is about time and memory, you always give us closeups of Terence Stamp’s character so that we can see how he feels about whatever he’s remembering. You gave up that option in Presence.

And that’s why the movie is as brief as it is. David and I talked about this: there were only so many variations to this gimmick before you’ve got to let people know what’s happening. We really felt like if you added stuff to make it any longer, you would’ve had to start adding elements that would have felt inorganic.

In a different way, the same was true for Black Bag. It’s a fairly short film — dense, but short. David and I talked about that, because in order for the movie to be any more complex, you’ve got to start adding another layer of plot, maybe some more characters. And neither of us felt like that was necessary or correct to do. David’s script came in at 106 pages.

That’s short for a feature-film script today. Your feature films tend to be short. Isn’t Traffic the longest, unless you count Che, which is really two films?

Exactly: Traffic is the longest. It’s hard for me to imagine, at this point, making a movie that’s more than two hours long. I like the idea that if somebody wants to watch something I directed for a second time, there’ll never be the impediment of, “Oh, but it’s long!” Sometimes my wife and I have that conversation: If it’s a certain hour of the night and we think about watching something, we’re like, “Yeah, but it’s, like, two hours and 17 minutes. We’re not going to make it.” I would rather my work be on a list of movies that are, like, 96 minutes. I am increasingly attracted to things that are distilled.

Correction: A previous version of this article mistook the name of the film Soderbergh directed Sasha Grey in.

https://vulture.com,Take a Seat at The Wedding Banquet,https://www.vulture.com/article/wedding-banquet-movie-remake.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 19:50:54 GMT","Take a seat in theaters, that is. Photo: Bleecker Street

Boy meets boy. Girl meets girl. Boy and boy and girl and girl are all friends, but when boy needs a green card, boy proposes to … girl? That’s the plot of the upcoming adaptation of the Taiwanese classic The Wedding Banquet, directed by Fire Island’s Andrew Ahn, who collaborated on the screenplay with one of the original film’s writers, James Schamus. That’s a lot to keep — pardon — straight. No worries; all the information we have about the movie is laid out below.

Is there a trailer?

The trailer for The Wedding Banquet has a lot to explain. The “comedy of errors” plot is twisty and complicated, with six major characters to introduce, but it can’t seem too twisty or else the audience won’t get that this is a light comedy. Luckily, there’s some handy title cards, like “Lee wants a baby with Angela” and “Min wants to stay with Chris,” along with a few choice lines, such as “I don’t even want to be an American! The trains are so slow and I never know what to tip!” to help everybody out.

Who’s in the cast?

The movie revolves around Min (Han Gi-Chan), a gay Korean man who wants to live in America with his boyfriend, Chris (Bowen Yang), but needs a green card. His Korean grandmother (Youn Yuh-Jung, fresh off an Oscar for Minari) can’t know he’s gay, so he proposes to his friend Lee (Kelly Marie Tran), who wants to have a baby with her girlfriend, Angela (Lily Gladstone). Min’s grandmother visits and hilarity ensues. Also in the cast is Joan Chen (Dídi), who plays Lee’s overly supportive mother to confirmed scene-stealing effect.

Wait … it’s a remake?

The original version of The Wedding Banquet came out (haha) in 1993. Directed by Ang Lee, the film’s various comedic machinations surrounding marriage play a little differently in an era when gay marriage was not legal. The original movie is incredibly beloved — it received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, and in 2023 it was selected by the Library of Congress to join the National Film Registry.

What do reviews say?

The movie already premiered at the Sundance Film Festival this past winter. “Even though we can foretell just about everything that will happen in The Wedding Banquet — every plot twist, every screwball complication — we don’t much mind, because the comedy is so brisk and good-natured,” Vulture film critic Bilge Ebiri wrote of the movie. He also added that its sincere moments are “sturdy and heartfelt.”

When is the release date?

The Wedding Banquet will be released in theaters on April 18 — the perfect time to start pre-pre-gaming Pride Month.",vulture

To quote Future, “Mask off.” Orville Peck will debut as the Emcee in the current Broadway production of Cabaret on March 31, answering the question amateur dramaturges everywhere want to know: Does the mask stay on? “The mask is part of my expression personally as an artist and a very big personal part of me,” Peck told the New York Times on March 17. “But I’m here to play this role and to bring respect and integrity and hopefully a good performance to it. It’s not about me. I’m not trying to make it the Orville Peck show.” Peck has been building up mystique since he released his first song, “Big Sky,” in 2018.

Neil Young actually did take a look at his life and he’s a lot like … Robert Smith. Encouraged by the loud advocacy of the Cure’s front man, Young will no longer be selling Ticketmaster “platinum tickets” to fans. Writing about the decision on his website, Young referred to a 2024 interview with Smith, who at the time criticized “fucking stupid or lying” musicians who allowed dynamic pricing — a demand-driven payment structure — to be utilized for their concerts. “It’s this story that really helped me to realize that I have a choice to make and can make a difference for my music loving friends. My management and agent have always tried to cover my back on the road, getting me the best deals they could,” he explained. “They have tried to protect me and my fans from the scalpers who buy the best tickets and resell them at huge increases for their own profits.” Young now acknowledges, despite this attempt to dissuade scalpers, attendees were still unfairly stuck with a higher cost. “The money went to me,” he added. “That did not feel right.” If only other artists would take a similar antidote.",vulture
https://vulture.com,The Best Anime Streaming Services of All,https://www.vulture.com/article/best-anime-streaming-services.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","Streamliner At your service.

From the moment Astro Boy first aired on NBC in 1963, anime has been a part of American TV-watching habits, whether audiences knew they were watching anime, or thought it was just another cartoon. But we’re long past the times where anime shows were reedited and repackaged into entirely new shows like Robotech and Voltron. And, for the most part, we’ve moved beyond the dark days of groan-inducing censorship and mistranslations, even if the differences still persist.

These days, however, anime is so popular that it’s become a part of nearly every major streaming service’s offering. You can usually watch the latest episodes of your favorite show mere hours after their initial Japanese broadcast, whether at niche, dedicated streaming services or at the larger players acquiring major simulcast licenses and financing original productions. That being said, as streaming companies have come to understand the business opportunities that hoards of anime fans represent, corporate mergers have led to the end of streamers like VRV and Funimation. Despite closures like those, each platform usually has its own set of exclusive titles, meaning anime fans have more choices to make than ever before if they want to catch their favorite shows.

That’s where we come in. The list below breaks down the many streaming services offering anime shows and movies, and we’ve split it up between the many services specifically made for anime fans and the general streamers that feature large anime hubs and libraries. Here’s what each one has to offer.

Streaming options tailored for anime lovers

What Netflix is to streaming, Crunchyroll is to anime streaming. This is where you go if you want the single biggest library of titles, where you find both Jujutsu Kaisen and Solo Leveling streaming right next to Planetes, Ping Pong the Animation, and the original Dragon Ball. Every new season brings dozens of new and returning anime, most of them streaming exclusively on this platform, giving you more anime than you can possibly watch. This includes some of the best anime of 2024, like Yatagarasu: The Raven Does Not Choose Its Master, as well as every episode of One Piece and some of the most exciting series we’ve already seen in 2025.

Want Crunchyroll?

Even if anime hits like Attack on Titan and Dan Da Dan can be found on other platforms, Crunchyroll’s biggest strength is its library of exclusives, one that also boasts original productions like Shenmue: The Animation.

Availability and support: Crunchyroll is available on consoles (including the Nintendo Switch, which doesn’t offer many streaming services), mobile devices, Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, and Amazon Fire. The app is also available on Samsung, Philips, and LG Smart TVs as well as the Apple Vision Pro. Crunchyroll is also a rare streamer with subtitles and dubbing in multiple languages available worldwide (not just geo-locked to your location) including Spanish, German, Russian, and Arabic.

Cost: The service has an ad-supported free tier, but it is severely limited. If you want to watch the entire Crunchyroll catalogue, including new episodes, you need a premium subscription. The premium plans start at $8 a month and go up to $15 a month for multiple devices, offline viewing, and more.

If you’re looking for somewhat more mature anime, HIDIVE is the service for you. Rather than prioritizing titles about high-schoolers with superpowers, this streamer prides itself in a more focused library that offers edgier shows like Dororo and the original When They Cry, or outright disturbing yet intriguing titles like Elfen Lied and Made in Abyss. It even has classic shows like earlier Lupin the Third and Princess Tutu.

Want HIDIVE?

And for those not looking forward to straight mature content, HIDIVE’s other specialization is its library of shojo anime that’s aimed at teenage girls. Even if shows like Dragon Ball are missing here, you will find K-On!, the great Oshi No Ko, and even Hideaki Anno’s first masterpiece, Gunbuster. In a way, HIDIVE is the Nintendo to Crunchyroll’s Xbox. The app is somewhat lackluster and offers no offline viewing, but many titles offer subtitles in multiple languages.

Availability and support: The app is available on mobile, Chromecast, Apple TV, Android TV, Roku, and Xbox One (sorry, PlayStation gamers).

Cost: The HIDIVE subscription is one of the cheaper ones at $6 a month or $60 a year.

If you yearn for the good ol’ days, this is the anime streamer for you. RetroCrush focuses not on buzzy new titles, but rather the bloody, sexy, often subversive anime from the time the medium was an underground obsession for American fans. That means entries like Ninja Scroll and Great Teacher Onizuka, but also the notoriously unhinged English dub of Ghost Stories and Aim for the Ace!. It’s a great place to discover shows like Lady Oscar: The Rose of Versailles and the original Astro Boy — classics known for their influence on future generations.

Want RetroCrush?

What RetroCrush lacks in fancy aesthetics or wider platform support, it compensates for with a “randomize” button that replaces hours of deciding what to watch with just the click of a button — kind of like channel surfing, but for anime. Likewise, the service’s many themed collections offer the kind of curation bigger streamers don’t have.

Availability and support: RetroCrush is only available on mobile, web browser, Roku, and Amazon Fire TV.

Cost: The service is free, but if you want an ad-free experience or some of the most premium titles, a subscription is $5 a month or $50 a year.

The mainstream services great for watching anime

Hulu’s anime hub, home to new simulcast anime like Attack on Titan and classic films like Akira. Photo: Hulu

Do you really need someone to pitch you on Netflix? Of course you don’t, but what may actually surprise you is that Netflix has a pretty great anime library that includes both modern classics like Hunter x Hunter and recent hits like Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End. Still, where Netflix shines the most is in its library of exclusives — both original productions and acquisitions.

Want Netflix?

Like Crunchyroll, Netflix has joined the seasonal simulcast game, becoming the only place you can stream new episodes of the masterpiece that is Orb: On the Movements of the Earth, as well as the Ranma 1/2 remake. Through the streamer’s partnership with NipponTV, this is also the one place to stream Naoki Urasawa’s phenomenal Monster. You can also stream the hugely influential Neon Genesis Evangelion exclusively on Netflix. Then you have the original productions. Since the debut of Devilman Crybaby, Netflix sort of revived the model of ‘80s “original video animation” (or “OVA”) which saw plenty of short auteur-driven anime not limited by budget, rating system or censorship. From the masterclass of storytelling that is Pluto, to the delightful Pokémon Concierge, Netflix constantly releases stunning new shows that push the medium forward while also producing some stunning collaborations with impressive studios like Scott Pilgrim Takes Off and Cyberpunk Edgerunners.

The biggest downside to Netflix’s model used to be the so-called “Netflix jail,” where new episodes of a show would take months to be released outside of Japan, but that thankfully seems to be a thing of the past. Nowadays, we get shows like Delicious in Dungeon not only getting new episodes out the same day as Japan, but even same-day dubs alongside the subbed version. Netflix seems to be Crunchyroll’s biggest competitor, and has now become a must-have streaming service for anime fans — alongside everyone else.

Availability and support: Netflix is widely supported and works on most devices.

Cost: Netflix’s price starts at $8 per month for the ad-supported plan, with the 4K plan setting you back $25 per month.

Hulu is a great option for those who are either new to the medium or don’t want to commit to a dedicated streaming service just for anime. The streamer has a good collection of popular modern shows like Blue Lock, Attack on Titan, My Hero Academia, and Dragon Ball Daima but also older titles like Inuyasha and the original Ranma 1/2. It boasts an impressive collection of anime essentials, with a taste of every genre and era of the medium.

Want Hulu?

Hulu now has exclusive titles too, joining the anime streaming wars with shows like Undead Unluck, the hilarious Power Rangers parody Go! Go! Loser Ranger!, and the Bleach revival Thousand-Year Blood War. The big problem with Hulu is that the service often suffers from subtitling issues as well as big delays like Netflix used to. Internationally, all Hulu anime are available on Disney+.

Availability and support: Hulu works on most devices (including the Nintendo Switch), but it only offers English subtitles.

Cost: A Hulu subscription starts at $10 a month (or $100 for a year) for the ad-supported plan, or $19 /month with no ads.

Sadly, following Sony’s acquisition of Crunchyroll, Max has all but removed its anime library. What is still there, however, is not to be ignored easily. There’s the fact that Max has the exclusive streaming rights to the Studio Ghibli collection, which is worth the subscription price alone. Additionally, Max has exclusive titles in the form of Adult Swim anime productions like “what if John Wick was an anime ninja?” Ninja Kamui, as well as the upcoming Lazarus by Cowboy Bebop creator Shinichiro Watanabe.

Availability and support: Max only offers subtitles in English, but it is available on all major devices.

Cost: The ad-supported plan is $10 a month or $100 for a year, while the ad-free plan starts at $17 a month or $170 a year.

Prime Video is a bit of a dark horse in the anime-streaming race as it doesn’t offer nearly as many titles as other services, but there are still some great shows to discover, from Banana Fish to Dororo. The real draw of this service, however, is the fact that Prime Video has the exclusive streaming rights to the Rebuild of Evangelion movies, and Hideaki Anno’s latest masterpiece Evangelion 3.0+1.0: Thrice Upon a Time.

Want Amazon Prime?

Availability and support: Amazon Prime Video is available on most major devices, but its language support can vary by title.

Cost: Prime Video will set you back $9 a month, while Amazon Prime costs $139 a year and includes plenty of other perks alongside your Prime Video membership.

A service that is completely free yet has a great selection of old and new anime, Tubi should not be overlooked when it comes to anime streaming. This ad-supported service includes classic movies like Akira, Paprika, and the fantastic anthology Memories (featuring shorts from the directors of Akira, Wolf’s Rain, and Perfect Blue). When it comes to TV shows, Tubi offers a variety of titles from Cardcaptor Sakura and Ouran High School Host Club to Yu-Gi-Oh! and Digimon Tri. As a rare exclusive, you can watch the 2022 movie Blue Thermal here. Even if Tubi may not necessarily make for the best single source of anime, it is both a great introduction to the medium and a free additional service to have in your anime journey.

Want Tubi?

Availability and support: Tubi works on most devices, despite its less-refined interface compared to most paid streaming apps. One aspect where it stands out from other services, even anime-centric ones is that it has a Spanish dub for several of their shows, including Knights of the Zodiac (a show that is infinitely superior in Spanish over English).

Cost: Nada, zip, zero, zilch.

South by Southwest may have begun as an independent music festival, but in the past few years, movies and tech have definitively overtaken the convention’s original focus. But, contrary to reports, SXSW won’t be cutting music entirely from its schedule. The Austin festival is paring back its schedule for 2026, from nine days to seven. (It will run March 12 to 18.) This means there won’t be a dedicated music weekend that used to close the festival. But, a spokesperson confirmed to the Austin American-Statesman that music events “will take place throughout the entire event.” 2026 festival passes are currently on sale, including a music option.

That’s not to say SXSW’s music arm is in a good spot going into 2026. The Statesman noted that the 2025 festival featured 1,015 acts — down from around 1,200 in 2024 and 2,000-plus at the mid-2010s peak. And this year’s flagship showcases reportedly failed to sell out. Per the Statesman, the festival used free RSVPs to fill showcases by artists like ascendant pop star Benson Boone, while other artists like country breakout Megan Moroney couldn’t even sell out the 2,750-capacity ACL Live with those free passes. This also comes after more than 60 artists dropped out of the 2024 festival over its ties to the military-industrial complex. The 2025 festival cut ties with the U.S. Army and defense contractors.",vulture
https://vulture.com,Which ‘The White Lotus’ Character Is Which Bravoleb?,https://www.vulture.com/article/white-lotus-season-3-characters-bravo-reality-tv-counterparts.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:06:01 GMT","This column originally appeared in Brian Moylan’s newsletter, The Housewives Institute Bulletin. Sign up here to be the first to read the next edition. Obviously the Tres Amigas, right? Not so fast… Photo: Fabio Lovino/HBO

It should surprise no one that Mike White, the creator, writer, and director of The White Lotus, is a fan of reality TV, considering he appeared on both The Amazing Race and Survivor. But we had no idea he was a huge Bravo fan. Sam Nivola, the actor who plays the youngest member of the Ratliff family, recently told People that White advised him and his co-stars to watch Southern Charm because that was his model for the family, or at least their accents. Well, now that you mention it, there are some striking similarities between many of this season’s characters and your favorite Bravolebs. Let’s break down the cast’s reality-docusoap counterparts.

• The Ratliff Family (Jason Isaacs, Parker Posey, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Sarah Catherine Hook, and Sam Nivola): They’re from the South, which is the obvious Southern Charm connection, but their dynamic brings a different Bravo family to mind: An eternally disengaged mother, a business-minded absent father who is oddly angry, a shockingly hot older son, a twink-y younger son questioning his sexuality, and a daughter who is barely there — are we sure this isn’t Meredith Marks and her clan? (I mean, have you seen her oldest?)

• Kate, Laurie, and Jaclyn (Leslie Bibb, Carrie Coon, and Michelle Monaghan): You thought I was going to say these three would be the Tres Amigas because they seem to be a trio, but one of them is always on the outs. But, no, I think they were inspired by a different threesome. One of them has gotten famous, the other two are resentful for it, but they also both talk shit about each other to the famous one. Yes, the famous one is Stassi Schroeder, and the other two are Katie Maloney Schwartz Maloney and Kristen Doute. These three are the Witches of WeHo.

• Rick and Chelsea (Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood): He is a stressed-out older man worried about how much everything costs and seems to be into some shady shit. She appears slightly bothered by her man at all times and feels free to spend money she knows she doesn’t have. If you just switch their accents, it’s PK and Dorit Kemsley.

• Sritala Hollinger (Lek Patravadi): She’s a little past her prime, thinks she is far more talented than she actually is, and keeps everyone waiting while she gets her glam done. She even has a random white dude following her around hyping her up all the time. What’s Karen Huger doing in Thailand? Isn’t she supposed to be in prison?

Kanye West just dropped one of the most problematic songs you could imagine. It’s got Ye himself. It’s got Diddy. And it’s got Kanye’s daughter North West — despite protests from her mom, Kim Kardashian. Kanye posted the song, called “Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine,” on X, where he claimed it was “by Puff Daddy,” on March 15. It starts with Sean “Diddy” Combs, currently jailed on federal sex-crimes charges, telling Kanye on the phone how it “meant so much” that the rapper took care of Diddy’s kids. “Yeah, absolutely, I love you so much, man,” Kanye replies. “It’s like, you raised me.” Then, the full track comes in, which also features Diddy’s 26-year-old son, rapper Christian “King” Combs, and an alleged newly signed Yeezy artist, Jasmine Williams.

North raps a short verse, where she repeats the line, “When you see me shinin’, then you see the light.” Before he dropped the song, West posted screenshots of texts with Kardashian, his ex-wife, discussing their daughter and the process of trademarking her name. “I sent paperwork over so she wouldn’t be in the Diddy song,” Kardashian apparently writes. “To protect her.” Kanye then threatens, “Amend it or I’m going to war,” adding, “You’re going to have to kill me.” He wrote on X that the screenshot “shows that I’m not playing.”

Kanye has since deleted both the song and the text screenshot. Per TMZ, Kardashian had demanded a cease and desist on the song before he posted it, and Kanye said he wouldn’t drop it. “She’s called everyone she could to keep this song from coming out,” TMZ reported. Kardashian has not responded to the song or Kanye’s latest X antics.",vulture
https://vulture.com,The White Lotus Has More Brotherly Love to Give,https://www.vulture.com/article/white-lotus-brothers-kiss.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:03:58 GMT","Intimate spoilers for The White Lotus season three episode five follow.

After weeks of the weirdest “Will they?/Won’t they?” on television, Mike White’s two favorite sons finally Lock-ied lips, even if they haven’t had Sex-on … yet. Actually, they kissed twice. Toward the end of White Lotus season three episode five, Lochlan (Sam Nivola) and Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), in the throes of a non-specific high, end up back in a room with Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood), who they’ve been attempting to flirt with for several episodes now. Lochlan whispers to Saxon and Chloe and Chelsea (not sisters) kiss. Saxon gets Lochlan and Chloe (not siblings) to kiss. Finally, with minor cajoling from the girls, Lochlan walks over to Saxon and gives him a peck on the lips. Then, a real kiss. There was definitely no tongue but lots of effort.

“Well obviously they’re not brothers by blood, so that made it easier,” Le Bon said of the filming process in a March 16 Vulture interview. “I think for Patrick it was really difficult. For Sam, he was kind of like, It’s whatever, let’s just do it well one time and it will be over. You know? Because if you don’t do it well the first time, then you have to do it over and over again. But Patrick’s reaction in the episode is his genuine reaction. We all thought he was going to throw up. And Sam was like, ‘It’s fine, it’s just a kiss, calm down!’”

Online, the reaction ranged from amazement to horror to horny to disappointment that the incest stopped with a kiss. It really shouldn’t have been a surprise — before the season even began, a profile of White Lotus creator Mike White in The New Yorker promised that, “The new season includes a hint of incest, or perhaps more than a hint.” As in, there is still more to come. A March 17 profile of Schwarzenegger in the New York Times promised that his role required “nudity and at least one disturbing sex scene.” At least!",vulture

Let us rejoice: John Mulaney, Richard Kind, and Saymo are gracing our screens in tandem again. Everybody’s Live With John Mulaney, the follow-up to Mulaney’s 2024 live talk show, Everybody’s in L.A, has begun its 12-week run. Despite the chaos and unpredictability baked into the show’s format, one thing we know to expect is an unlikely mishmash of guests. “This will be the one place where you could see Arnold Schwarzenegger sitting next to Nikki Glaser sitting next to a family therapist with music by Mannequin Pussy,” the comedian joked during Netflix’s Next on Netflix event in January. With the show finally hitting our screens, we don’t have to deal in hypotheticals any longer. Below, everything we know so far, including a trailer and this week’s special guests.

Who are the guests going live?

March 12: Michael Keaton, Joan Baez, Fred Armisen, personal finance columnist Jessica Roy, and music from Cypress Hill.

March 19: Nick Kroll, Ben Stiller, Quinta Brunson, cruise industry expert Anne Kalosh, and music from Kim Gordon and Kim Deal

Let’s see the trailer.

The scene opens on Mulaney standing in a ground-level parking lot, barely visible in the sights of an aerial drone camera. “Let me know when you’re tight enough that I should say the line,” he says as the drone camera slowly creeps in. “Is someone going to cue me … I just want to be tight enough that saying the line makes sense.” Because, if we learned anything from the first iteration of this show, “making sense” is undeniably one of its creative priorities.

What else did Mulaney say at Next on Netflix?

Aside from revealing that the show would be less L.A.-centric than its predecessor and that his two beloved sidekicks would be returning, the comedian gave an address light on details but heavy on jokes. “We will be live globally with no delay,” he said. “We will never be relevant. We will never be your source for news. We will always be reckless. Netflix will always provide us with data that we will ignore.” Elsewhere, he joked that “there is absolutely nothing new” about the show’s conceit, but that he is simply “taking a lot of elements other people have already done and doing them out of order so” it feels fresh by default. “Not since Harry and Meghan has Netflix given more money to someone without a specific plan,” he said.

Will this be the show’s last season?

Not unless something goes terribly wrong. Netflix was apparently so enthused by Mulaney’s pitch that they gave Everybody’s Live a two-season order.

https://vulture.com,"Neil Young’s Lost Albums, Ranked",https://www.vulture.com/article/neil-young-lost-albums-ranked-best-to-worst.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 09:00:18 GMT","Photo: Gijsbert Hanekroot/Redferns

In the 2002 Neil Young biography Shakey, Young’s late friend and longtime producer David Briggs shared an insight into the singer’s prolific mid-’70s period that has since been enshrined in the halls of Neil lore. “He’d turn to me and go, ‘Guess I’ll turn on the tap’ — and then out came ‘Powderfinger,’ ‘Pocahontas,’ ‘Out of the Blue,’ and ‘Ride My Llama,’” Briggs said. “I’m not talkin’ about sittin’ down with a pen and paper, I’m talkin’ about pickin’ up a guitar, lookin’ me in the face, and in 20 minutes — ‘Pocahontas.’”

Like all good rock-and-roll mythmaking, Briggs’s version of events doesn’t entirely hold up to scrutiny; Shakey clarifies elsewhere that Young started toying with “Powderfinger” in the late ’60s, and it wouldn’t exactly come as a shock to learn that the free-associative final verse on “Pocahontas” about the Astrodome and Marlon Brando was written in a drug-adjacent fit of inspiration. Still, Briggs’s overall point stands. In the span of a few short years, so many songs poured out of Young that it’s taken him decades to release them all.

Since 2017, as an offshoot of the Neil Young Archives, Young has debuted a steady stream of so-called “lost” albums — completed records that he intended to drop when he made them but ultimately decided to shelve for one reason or another. (The most recent one, Oceanside Countryside, came out this month.) Predictably, most of these stem from that hyperproductive stretch of the ’70s, when the singer amassed so much material that he found himself cutting albums left and right, trying to find the best home for each song. In most cases, he succeeded, so the lost albums are full of alternate takes on songs that ended up elsewhere, in addition to the occasional unreleased gem or abandoned curio. While that means the lost records don’t contain too many songs Neil-heads haven’t already heard in one form or another, they do provide a window into how Young chiseled a defining era of his career out of a massive slab of raw music.

“What if” scenarios and alternate timelines abound on these projects, but how do they work as actual albums? I’ve tried to assess that below, but first, some ground rules: I’ve included only the projects that were conceived as studio albums, completed, and then shelved. This means no Early Daze — the compilation that Young recently put out of his early-career studio sessions with Crazy Horse. (Though that’s worth a listen.) And Young has to have put the record out as a stand-alone release, so no albums like 1982’s Island in the Sun or 1987’s Summer Songs, which are only available, for now, in a recent $240 Neil Young Archives box set. Feel free to send me one, Neil.

5. Toast (recorded in 2001, released in 2022)

For a guy whose catalogue has plenty of earnest, devastatingly romantic tunes, Young can still be cagey about what parts of himself he chooses to put out there — a quality that might explain why there are two records on this list that he initially buried because he felt they were too sad. The first is Toast, a collection he recorded with Crazy Horse shortly before scrapping it in favor of 2002’s Are You Passionate?, an R&B genre experiment on which he swapped out the Horse for ’60s soul legends Booker T. & the M.G.’s. Four of the seven songs on Toast wound up on Are You Passionate?, but it’s shocking how little of their usual fast-and-loose, dive-bar-band energy the Crazy Horse boys manage to inject into those songs, often sounding instead like they’re doing an (impressive!) impression of an M.G.’s-era R&B band. The breakup ballads are just idiosyncratic enough to remain uniquely Neil, but the album peaks with the more traditional Horse rockers, like the ten-minute, surf-rock-tinged “Gateway of Love.” If the intermittently successful genre-experimenting of Are You Passionate? gives that album a unique hook, Toast is a replacement-level entry into the latter-day Crazy Horse canon.

4. Oceanside Countryside (recorded in 1977, released in 2025)

By 1978, casual fans who threw on Harvest at dinner parties had likely all but given up on Young ever returning to the radio-ready folk sound of “Heart of Gold.” But after his detour into downer classics like Tonight’s the Night, Young was ready to throw those folks some red meat. The result was Comes a Time, an upbeat country-folk record that quickly outsold all six albums since Harvest. Oceanside Countryside comes from that same vein (even sharing a few songs with Comes a Time) and has a compelling formal conceit: The first five tracks were recorded solo in Florida and Malibu and thus comprise the “Oceanside” half, while Young recorded the more hoedown-friendly “Countryside” songs on the B-side with a full band in Nashville. It’s a fun format, and when the fiddle kicks in on “Field of Opportunity” at the start of the B-side, it gives the album a necessary jolt of energy. That said, there’s not much that’s new here, and while I’ve tried to judge the albums on this list in a vacuum, it’s hard not to think while listening to Oceanside Countryside that Young made the right choice putting out Comes a Time instead.

3. Hitchhiker (recorded in 1976, released in 2017)

At the risk of mistaking mysticism for scientific truth, I think it’s safe to say Neil Young is connected to the moon. Between 1975 and 1977, he spent many a full moon holed up in a studio with Briggs at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, attempting to record songs at the same breakneck speed he was writing them. On one such night in August 1976, Young recorded ten in a row under the simplest of conditions — just himself, a guitar, a harmonica, and the occasional break for weed, beer, or coke. The final product was Hitchhiker, an unvarnished little collection of some of Young’s best songs, made all the more intimate by the occasional missed chord or offhanded moments like the giggle at the beginning of “Hawaii.” You could argue that Hitchhiker is more of a performance than an album, but its stripped-down simplicity is also the ultimate stress test for the songs, recasting “Powderfinger,” for instance, as an undeniable folk standard. My only gripe is that it may have technically been recorded under a waning gibbous.

2. Chrome Dreams (recorded 1974–77, released in 2023)

When Neil played the then-unreleased Chrome Dreams for Carole King in 1977, she laughed at him, saying it was hardly a proper album, and that Young played solo on too many songs. Listening to it now, you can see what she meant. At times, the album is as stripped-down and rough around the edges as Hitchhiker — on the self-recorded “Will to Love,” for example, you can even hear a fireplace crackling in the background. Young opted not to release the album, and most of its songs wound up in other forms on other projects. But Chrome Dreams also took on a life of its own, circulating widely as a bootleg for decades before eventually getting a proper release in 2023. (In 2007, Young called a totally unrelated album Chrome Dreams II — meaning the sequel technically got released first.) Despite the semantics of King’s critique, Chrome Dreams carries a strange power that makes it more coherent in retrospect. Many of the songs here wound up as the centerpieces of the albums they eventually landed on (e.g., “Like a Hurricane” on American Stars ’N Bars), so listening to Chrome Dreams feels a bit like bearing witness to Young’s universe before its Big Bang, seeing all the pieces in one place before they scattered to their eventual homes. It all worked out how it was supposed to in the end. Thanks, Carole.

1. Homegrown (recorded 1974–75, released in 2020)

The other record on this list that Young shelved because it felt too raw, Homegrown was intended to be the follow-up to 1974’s On the Beach, until Young decided to put out the dingier Tonight’s the Night instead. When he finally released Homegrown in 2020, Young called it the missing link between Harvest and Comes a Time, presumably because it represents a partial return to the soft-folk sound of his most popular music. But Homegrown is a little stranger than that suggests, chronicling the collapse of Young’s relationship to the actress Carrie Snodgress with uncomfortable specificity. For instance, it’s hard to imagine how anyone could hide away a great song for almost 50 years that features Levon Helm on the drums, until you hear “Separate Ways,” the devastatingly intimate Homegrown opener about co-parenting amid a breakup (“Sharin’ our little boy / Who grew from joy back then”). “Try,” a casually indelible little folk tune with Emmylou Harris singing backup, sounds on its face like any number of lilting, romantic Neil songs from the early ’70s. But it, too, is intimately ensnared in Young’s relationship with Snodgress, with its best line — “I’d like to take a chance / But shit, Mary, I can’t dance” — referring to something her then-recently deceased mother used to say.

The rest of Homegrown plays out like a tour through Young’s different personas at the time, shuffling through rootsy Americana (“Love Is a Rose”) and grungy rockers (“Vacancy”), with a delicate love song or two (“Kansas”) along the way. It probably would’ve satisfied a broader audience than Tonight’s the Night in 1975, but emerging in the throes of 2020, it felt like a small miracle. If Young’s taught us again and again throughout his career that he’ll never give you exactly what you want when you want it, just know he’ll get around to it eventually.",vulture

This article is updated regularly as Oscar contenders enter theaters and streaming services.

The Oscars came and went! On March 2, the Academy awarded the best films, performances, and craft of 2024 in a madcap broadcast hosted by Conan O’Brien. There were some surprises, some snubs, some sermons, and a sweep of five categories by Best Picture winner Anora, which ceded ground on only one of its nominations. In the afterglow of all the accolades you may be wondering: Where can I see all these movies? With so many streaming services and companies taking different paths to bring their A-list projects to viewers, it can be overwhelming work to simply track down these acclaimed titles. If you need to catch up, we’re here to help with detailed information on the streaming availability of every single feature nominee. Don’t plan on leaving the house anytime soon.

The Awards Chatter: The second-most nominated film of this year’s Oscars got to double digits because of its remarkable ensemble and technical achievements. The epic drama starring Adrien Brody as a Hungarian architect in postwar America started its run at Venice, where it won the Silver Lion, and went through waves of critics groups (it won Best Picture at Chicago, for example). It was a big winner at the Globes, taking home Best Picture (Drama), Actor, and Director. It may not have won quite as many on Oscars night, but it did give Brody his moment (or a few).

It only got one Golden Globe nomination, but it was a biggie: Best Picture. And it continued that odd trend at the Oscars, getting only two nods, including the big one, though it didn’t win any.

This list was originally published on March 15, 2019. It has been updated to include additional episodes. Lucky you.

St. Patrick’s Day is a holiday unlike any other. While the core meaning of a lot of Christian holidays is lost over time, giving way to feasts of capitalism and overindulging, St. Patrick’s Day has kinda always been a little about that. Historically, one aspect of the celebrations was that the Lent restrictions on alcohol would be lifted for the day. Now, many revelers take that to the furthest degree, spending the day wearing green, drinking themselves into oblivion, and not spending too much time thinking about Saint Patrick or the meaning of Irish identity. Its closest relative is Halloween, another holiday rooted in tomfoolery and chaos that unites and divides us in equal measure.

These days, the meaning of the holiday is that chaos. But if you’d rather watch the wild antics from afar than head to your local pub and drain it of cheap, we’ve got your solution — 11 of the best St. Patrick’s Day TV episodes, many of which feature magic and hedonism to enjoy vicariously.

It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, “Charlie Catches a Leprechaun” (Season 11, Episode 8)

Despite its bar’s namesake (Paddy’s Pub), somehow Sunny got to season 11 before having a St. Patrick’s Day episode. In an otherwise pretty weak season, “Charlie Catches a Leprechaun” makes the most of Charlie’s endearing childlike curiosity and gullibility while Dennis tries to streamline the bar with a booze-selling wagon. After a man is caught pickpocketing, he tells Charlie he’s a leprechaun and Charlie believes him; setting glue traps to catch him, and going on a wild goose chase all over town with Mac to track him. Leaning into the more magical, whimsical aspects of the holiday, this episode sees the gang at their best instead of relying on tired tropes of drunkenness.

Bob’s Burgers, “Flat-Top O’ the Morning to Ya” (Season 10, Episode 16)

Bob’s Burgers loves a holiday episode, but this is the first and only dedicated to St. Patrick’s Day. Here Linda and Teddy get a little too in the festive spirit. It starts innocently enough with an Irish-themed breakfast, but Bob is keen to keep things classy (and not green) in the restaurant. While Bob goes on his own side quest, Linda and Teddy egg each other on, starting out with dyeing some beer green and moving on to coloring … everything — ketchup, mustard, fries, burgers. But their enthusiasm doesn’t quite rub off on the customers, who’d rather not chow down green meat. In the end, they take it to the streets, bringing back all the drunk and hungry revelers to eat as many on-theme burgers as their hearts desire.

Available to stream on Hulu

The Afterparty, “High School” (Season 1, Episode 5)

Innovative murder-mystery comedy The Afterparty sees a group of ex-classmates under suspicion for the murder of an old friend. Everyone is a suspect, and there’s a lot of buildup to finding out what happened at a fateful St. Patrick’s Day party 15 years prior — especially when Chelsea (Ilana Glazer) makes a mysterious reference to an incident that made the entire school ostracize her. Diving into St. Patrick’s Day 2006, we see Walt (Jamie Demetriou) observing everything from his fly-on-the-wall-position at a house rager straight out of a teen movie: early-aughts fashion choices, lots of alcohol, and a painful reminder of the horrors of the high-school rumor mill. Bonus points if you can spot Walt lurking in the background of every shot.

Sabrina the Teenage Witch, “Salem, the Boy” (Season 3, Episode 17)

St. Patrick’s Day (and Irish culture) is often associated with magic, gold, and leprechauns. In “Salem, the Boy,” Sabrina the Teenage Witch leans into that association, with Roland returning as a leprechaun. He gives Sabrina three golden coupons that grant her wishes; which, as we know, never goes well. She turns Salem into a man, but his essence is placed into a boy at school, leading to his attempts to take over the world. It’s a silly, fun episode with no real stakes but lots of ridiculousness and capers all round — perfect for the holiday.

How I Met Your Mother, “No Tomorrow” (Season 3, Episode 12)

In “No Tomorrow,” the How I Met Your Mother gang gives into the green hedonism of St Patrick’s Day after attempting to stay at home and have a board-game night. When Barney convinces Ted that the day has no consequences, Ted goes hog wild on behaving badly and finds that his bad deeds actually reward him: For one night only, he can live consequence-free, just like Barney. While Ted doesn’t feel too pleased with himself afterward, there is a lesson in here that every St. Paddy’s Day reveler seems to hope to be true: that your behavior on that night is, if not inconsequential, then forgivable.

Cheers, “Bar Wars VII: The Naked Prey” (Season 11, Episode 19)

Naturally, more than one show on this list takes place in a bar. In Cheers, the original bar-based comedy, they took the St Patrick’s Day episode hijinks as far as they could reasonably take them. In the episode, the bar is in an annual battle for sales against Gary’s Olde Towne Tavern — and loses. As in the Sunny episode, the stakes are more about business and pride than having wild, raucous fun — partly because, well, running a bar over St. Patrick’s Day probably isn’t that much fun, but it definitely brings in a lot of money. Catch this episode of Cheers and then spare a thought (and a big tip) for your local bartender if you go out this weekend.

30 Rock, “St Patrick’s Day” (Season 6, Episode 12)

30 Rock has special episodes for every holiday you could think of (shout out to “Leap Day”), and St. Patrick’s Day is no exception. Here, Liz’s hatred for the holiday, and a particular Irish American (her ex-boyfriend Dennis Duffy), comes to a head. She attempts to stay inside and avoid the revelry — something you might be trying to do, reader, even if it isn’t always possible. When Dennis shows up at her apartment claiming to be married, Liz tries to deal with it, all in her Liz Lemon way. Elsewhere, Jenna and Tracy each fight to be lead host of the St Patrick’s Day parade. It’s a perfect 30 Rock episode, full of arguments, megalomania, and general disdain, all heightened by the holiday.

Charmed, “Lucky Charmed” (Season 5, Episode 17)

Magic is a theme in a few of these episodes, but perhaps none more so than in Charmed. In “Lucky Charmed,” a less fun St. Paddy’s Day episode than others on the list, leprechauns get their turn to be more of a sympathetic force than a tricksy, difficult, troublesome one. A demon is out killing leprechauns and stealing their magic, so the Charmed Ones, as always, step in to help. The girls battle the evil magic and attempt to reverse the leprechauns’ legendary bad luck, proving St. Patrick’s Day doesn’t always have to go as badly as it has in the past.

The Office, “St Patrick’s Day” (Season 6, Episode 19)

Luckily, the holiday falls on a weekend this year, which means those so inclined can get in their partying without worrying about work. Not so in this classic episode of The Office, in which Dunder Mifflin’s employees are all stuck at work after being made to stay later by Jo. Eventually, Michael is forced to be direct with Jo and tell her he’s letting the employees leave. She relents, and we have a happy ending, as the employees get to enjoy their St. Patrick’s Day in a bar, as it was intended by St. Patrick himself.

Available to stream on Peacock

Home Improvement, “Desperately Seeking Willow” (Season 7, Episode 19)

St. Patrick’s Day should be a time for hedonism and letting loose, but in this Home Improvement episode, Wilson’s visiting niece, Willow, has a bit too much fun, failing to return home from the club and scaring everyone into sending out a search party. Meanwhile, there’s a St. Patrick’s Day celebration on Tool Time. It’s a holiday episode within a holiday episode — Tim and Al wear lots of green, the set is dressed in Guinness merch, there’s Irish-themed improvement projects, and Tim opens with an attempt at an offensive limerick. It’s an episode that proves that all you really need to celebrate holiday (even on a Tuesday) is to get into the spirit, which might just mean painting your toolbox green. Also don’t get lost.

2 Broke Girls, “And the Kilt Trip” (Season 3, Episode 19)

As with many festive and outgoing holidays, a lot of us more introverted types might find ourselves grudgingly trying to join the fun even if it’s not quite our bag. That’s what happens in 2 Broke Girls’ “And the Kilt Trip” when, seeking to fit in with Max and her other friends, Caroline joins everyone to get crazy at the St. Patrick’s Day parade. Surprise: She has a not-so-great time, and instead longs to enjoy her own old holiday traditions at the Plaza Hotel.

The Academy isn’t wasting any more time deciding: Conan O’Brien is coming back to host the Oscars for the second year in the row. In a joint statement, Academy CEO Bill Kramer and president Janet Yang said they are “thrilled” to bring O’Brien back, as well as returning executive producers Raj Kapoor and Katy Mullan and returning producers Jeff Ross and Mike Sweeney. “This year, they produced a hugely entertaining and visually stunning show that celebrated our nominees and the global film community in the most beautiful and impactful way,” the statement said. “Conan was the perfect host — skillfully guiding us through the evening with humor, warmth, and reverence. It is an honor to be working with them again.”

O’Brien didn’t bother reciprocating with any compliments about the Academy in his statement, instead opting to explain, “The only reason I’m hosting the Oscars next year is that I want to hear Adrien Brody finish his speech.” Whether we get a sequel to those record-breaking thank-yous or not, the 2026 Oscars will take place on March 15, 2026, and air live out of the Dolby Theatre on ABC at 7 p.m. ET. Conan, if you’re reading this, we’d like to remind you that there’s someone we’d like to see you bring onstage.",vulture
https://vulture.com,The Righteous Gemstones Recap: Wasting Away in Margaritaville,https://www.vulture.com/article/the-righteous-gemstones-recap-season-4-episode-2.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 02:43:49 GMT","The Righteous Gemstones You Hurled Me Into the Very Heart of the Seas Season 4 Episode 2 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Jake Giles Netter/HBO

There’s no better song choice to close this emotionally turbulent and spectacularly vulgar episode than Pet Shop Boys’ “It’s a Sin,” a synth-pop classic from 1987 that at once serves the disco-era grotesquerie of the Aimee-Leigh Give-A-Thon inside the Gemstone megachurch and underlines Eli Gemstone’s late-life urge to sow his wild oats. Though Pet Shop Boys singer Neil Tennant had not yet come out of the closet in 1987, “It’s a Sin” references the shame-based repression of his Catholic-school education: “For everything I long to do / No matter when or where or who / Has one thing in common, too.” Then comes the chorus.

It’s funny to think about any kind of repression being an issue in the Gemstone family, which generally allows itself to indulge in the sins (and the language) it condemns on Sundays, but when considering the idea of their father taking up with another woman, Jesse, Kelvin, and Judy are as grossed out as they would have been as schoolchildren. “Could you even imagine if Daddy met someone new?” says Kelvin. “Yucky ducks!” Even though the children find plenty of evidence that their dad has been drinking and carousing on a boat in the Florida Keys, the thought of Eli taking up with someone other than their dead mother is so impossible that they accept his explanation that he uses a bra to catch fish. “All your dick juices are gone,” says Judy, “’cause Mama’s got ’em in a jar up in heaven.”

Eli is indeed wasting away in Margaritaville, doing his own variation on the South Florida cliché of a divorced or widowed gray-hair tomcatting around the marina. However, as difficult as it may be to call a show as bluntly comedic as The Righteous Gemstones “nuanced,” the way Eli handles his one-night stand the morning after sets him apart. For one, it’s not really a one-night stand: The two have been seeing each other for long enough for his lover to want something more from their relationship, suggesting that Eli needed a few dates to justify the sin most men in his situation would commit after a single boozy night at the cantina. He’s even enough of a gentleman to break it off with her gently, frying up a couple of sunny-side-up eggs to see her off in the morning. It’s a torment for him to admit he doesn’t like her. (Credit John Goodman for stretching his jaw a bit at the line, “We 69’d for 40 minutes straight!”)

The Gemstone kids pick up on the obvious signs their father has turned into a seafaring layabout — the long hair, the quarter-filled tequila bottle, the general unkempt bachelor quality of the boat — but they can’t begin to perceive what Eli is going through, much less understand him as a man still capable of love and sex. They just need him to come back for the telethon for their mom, because the church needs as many revenue streams open as possible without him around. The fact that they’re even producing this splashy telethon around their dead mother is a sign that the Gemstone business still has to lean heavily on its past because Eli’s unholy trinity of failchildren are having trouble holding the congregation on their own.

Not that they aren’t trying, mind. Kelvin and Keefe are thrilled by the early returns for Prism, an effort to broaden Kelvin’s hip youth pastor schtick into a more inclusive place for Christians. Keefe presses for Kelvin to make their relationship more public and even suggests getting married, but Kelvin wants to dance a two-step where everyone probably knows about their relationship but they aren’t up front about it. He likens their partnership to Siegfried and Roy in that audiences knew “they were licking each other’s wieners” but wouldn’t stick around for the white tigers if they made it explicit.

For his part, Jesse and his family are out hawking high-tech worship kiosks called Prayer Pods for people who want a space at the mall or the airport to access Gemstone sermons and hymns (and episodes of Bible Bonkers) at times of spiritual need, like when they’re waiting for their wives to finish shopping. The pods look like a cross between a modern airport work booth and the teleportation device in The Fly, but it’s currently seeming more like a containment unit for Jesse’s son’s farts. The prominent credit-card swiper offers 15 minutes for the high price of $15, and the show follows up on the Gemstones’ mercenary shamelessness later when someone working the telethon phone bank asks for a donor’s routing number.

Eli’s return to the church for the event — prompted mainly by his grown children egging him with the word “pussy” — brings an authentic feeling to the whole shameless affair. It also brings a visitor in Lori Milsap, Aimee’s best friend, played by Megan Mullally, an actress whose brassiness on comedies like Party Down and Parks and Recreation fits in perfectly here. Having discounted their father’s libido earlier, the kids don’t notice that Eli and Lori have a connection, and their old man still has enough game to follow through on it. That’s one of the standout pieces of this episode: Eli has a gentle charisma his children lack, which serves him onstage and backstage. (Lori hearing Eli say, “Time surely has been kind to you” in that lacquered Goodman voice seems to get her at the knees.)

The episode ends with the Pet Shop Boys song playing as it juxtaposes two transcendent moments: Eli and Lori’s first kiss, and Jesse Gemstone ascending to the rafters with his jet-pack. Who’s the real sinner here?

Uncut Gemstones

• Between this show and The White Lotus, HBO was already giving you all the Walton Goggins you could handle, but this episode gives you that much more. As lowbrow laughs go, there’s nothing funnier than full-frontal male nudity, and there’s certainly no funnier moment than Baby Billy dropping his drawers in front of the Gemstones in the dressing room after their rehearsal goes awry. “Behold, look at this. That’s my privates right there.” Indeed so.

• The Judy Gemstone filth level remains amplified. After witnessing the spectacle of BJ doing a core-strength workout on the stripper pole, she unleashes her carnal desires: “Watching you work that pole’s got me slick, boy. ’Bout to start finger dancin’ on my snapdragz. Talkin’ bout my clitty cat.”

• The Kelvin Gemstone Bible: “Let’s get rid of that yucky stuff and focus on the good stuff.”

• Jesse’s resentment over his father becoming a mentor figure for Gideon comes out in typically childlike form: “Go be butt buddies with your granddaddy. See if I care.”

• The wardrobe choices on the show are always a treat, but let’s give a special mention to the red velvet tracksuit that Jesse wears to his jet-pack lesson. It really bunches up nicely in the harness.

• “I’m Tyler Perry and you ain’t. You’re more like Luke Perry: dead.” Woof. That’s a tough line.",vulture

A link to each category will lead to lists of the ever-changing contenders, plus reporting on what shows are playing well with voters, TV Academy rules changes, interviews with potential nominees, and more.

The State of the Race

As the TV season winds down, it is time to begin the conversation around which shows will win at the 2025 Emmys. (It is!)

The Television Academy will be looking to honor programs that aired between June 1, 2025 and May 31, 2025, a period of time still reeling from the widespread contraction of work in the industry, as well as the wildfires that devastated Los Angeles in January.

However, unlike last year, which was jam-packed with two Emmys ceremonies, but was short on returning series, the Outstanding Drama Series race alone has Emmy winners like “Severance,” “The White Lotus,” “The Last of Us,” “Squid Game,” and “The Handmaid’s Tale” all back in contention for more awards.

Similarly, “Hacks,” “The Bear,” “Abbott Elementary,” and “Only Murders in the Building” are all back in the Outstanding Comedy Series race, which has gotten more and more competitive by the year.

Looking at the winter awards season, there have not been too many new shows to break through besides limited series “The Penguin” on HBO, but as we have seen before with a project like “Baby Reindeer,” there is still room for more shows to surprise and delight us by the time the first round of Emmys voting wraps on Monday, June 23, and nominations are announced on Tuesday, July 15.



For more insight on the shows and stars we expect to be contenders this Emmys season, see the individual prediction pages listed below.

The multi-disciplinary event is so massive — covering everything from film and TV to music, virtual reality, comedy, and tech— that it often feels impossible to sift through everything on the schedule. But IndieWire was on the ground throughout the film and TV portion of the festival, and we’ve selected 15 film and TV projects that are worthy of your continued attention.

From star-studded headliners like Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s Hollywood satire “The Studio” and Christopher Landon’s latest horror effort “Drop” to small independent films, the festival offered an excellent slate of narrative and documentary projects for film and TV lovers of all stripes. Several of our favorites came from first-time directors, including Jing Ai Ng’s art crime thriller “Forge” and Matthew Shear’s neurotic story of missed connections “Fantasy Life.” There were also plenty of thrilling documentaries, from Michael Bay’s high-flying parkour saga “We Are Storror” to the reptile extermination film “The Python Hunt.”

SXSW enjoys a unique spot on the festival calendar, allowing it to help some films build on their momentum after playing Sundance and giving other films a platform before they reemerge on the fall festival circuit. And you never know when a SXSW film could establish itself as a player in next year’s awards race — just look back to “Everything Everywhere All at Once” as proof of what’s possible.

https://indiewire.com,"‘Novocaine’ Grossed Awfully Low for No. 1 at the Box Office, but There’s Been Worse",https://www.indiewire.com/news/box-office/novocaine-no-1-box-office-analysis-1235104330/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 18:18:22 GMT","Good thing “Novocaine” can’t feel pain, because this one hurts. Paramount’s “Novocaine” hit No. 1 at the domestic box office this weekend despite grossing just $8.7 million. That’s the lowest total for a movie to top the box office this year in a given weekend, and it led a dismally weak weekend on the whole at the domestic box office, in which the Top 10 earned just a cumulative $45.2 million, the worst of 2025 thus far.

It will come as a surprise to no one that the box office has been bleak since the pandemic, but you don’t even have to go back that far to find a weekend that had a worse No. 1. For that we look to February 9-11 2024 when the No. 1 movie in America was Universal’s “Argylle” in its second weekend in theaters, earning just $6.2 million. The biggest new release that weekend was Focus Features’ “Lisa Frankenstein,” which bombed to $3.6 million and yet was No. 2 for the weekend.

“Novocaine,” however, was a new release, whereas “Argylle” was in its second weekend, and the same goes for the $6.9 million that the “Mean Girls” musical made in its second weekend also in 2024. Among new releases, February 10-12 2023, had “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” open to only $8.3 million, beating out “Avatar: The Way of Water” in its ninth weekend in theaters. “The Invitation” in August 26-28 2022 was just a $6.8 million opening for No. 1. According to Comscore, since the start of 2021, six films have opened below “Novocaine’s” $8.7 million and hit No. 1, those being “Raya and the Last Dragon,” “Wrath of Man,” “Magic Mike’s Last Dance,” “The New Mutants,” “Nobody,” and “The Invitation.”

But “The Invitation” arrived in the last weekend of August when a lot of movies are dumped in a traditionally slow weekend at the box office, and February can be forgiven for the same reason. “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” opened during Super Bowl weekend and ended up adding over 1,500 screens in Week 2, mitigating its second weekend drop.

“Novocaine” — and everything else that opened behind it — has less of an excuse. It was a wide release with 3,365 screens and opened in the middle of March when kids are starting to go on Spring Break and when more tentpoles are generally arriving. If you want to be optimistic, you can say that four of the Top 6 were original films, not sequels or based on an existing franchise. That includes “Mickey 17,” which had a steep 60 percent drop in Week 2 ($7.51 million), Steven Soderbergh’s “Black Bag” ($7.5 million), and “The Last Supper” ($2.8 million). A24’s horror film “Opus” didn’t crack the Top 10 with just over $1 million grossed, and though it’s hardly an original film, “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Toons Movie” is the first fully-animated Looney Tunes movie to hit theaters. It made $3.17 million. Not too shabby for a movie that Warner Bros. canceled and sold.

The good news for “Novocaine” is that it will almost certainly still make a profit. The film was produced for just $18 million, pretty rare for a studio film, and got a B Cinemascore, so word of mouth should help this movie heading into Week 2.

But if audiences aren’t showing up for a slate as diverse as this one, what will bring them to movie theaters? The way “Captain America: Brave New World” is shaping up, it’s on pace to finish below the $476 million grossed by “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Adult audiences haven’t given the time of day to a Soderbergh spy movie with Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender, a new Bong Joon Ho sci-fi head-trip, or a Marvel tentpole.

Next weekend is Disney’s “Snow White,” which has been hounded by people angry at it on both sides of the political spectrum. The next major IP project after that is WB’s “The Minecraft Movie” opening April 4. If those don’t hit, then unlike “Novocaine,” everyone will be feeling the pain.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Trump Killed Voice of America. The Voice of Documentary Filmmakers and Public Media May Be Next,https://www.indiewire.com/features/commentary/trump-voice-of-america-whats-next-docs-public-media-1235104135/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","In the Trump Administration’s latest attack on free speech and public media, the President signed an executive order March 15 that effectively shut down the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America as well as a host of other international broadcasting entities such as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. In an interview with NPR, Grant Turner, the former CFO at the USAGM, called the firings “Bloody Saturday” for the agency and its networks.

This has heightened anxieties for diverse documentary filmmakers and organizations that already were threatened by the authoritarian political administration. Much of their work and distribution is tied to publicly funded media; one prominent documentary nonprofit that supports creators of color estimates 80 percent of their projects connect to public media in some way.

“We are caught in this terrible place with what’s been happening on the commercial side with streaming companies focusing on true crime above everything else, and the existential threat on the public media side,” said one documentary industry insider.

Many in the documentary field are specifically concerned about the upcoming Congressional Oversight DOGE subcommittee hearing on federal funding of public media tentatively scheduled for March 26, where presidents and CEOs of NPR and PBS, Katherine Maher and Paula Kerger, respectively, have been called to testify. The hearing will be chaired by Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has accused both NPR and PBS of producing “systemically biased” content. (The most-watched show on PBS is “Antiques Roadshow.“)

“There are a lot of people in the PBS system who are afraid about what they can program, and that definitely affects the films we produce,” said one documentary funder, whose work centers on underrepresented filmmakers. “I worry that PBS organizations are going to really shy away from anything that is political, but I don’t know where that line is drawn. It’s probably true that they’ll stay away from trans experiences and Palestinian stories, but is climate change going to be okay? Is police brutality?”

While the President’s anti-DEIA and “gender ideology” orders continue to be litigated in the courts, there remain plenty of examples of “anticipatory obedience,” said documentary filmmaker Razi Jafri. “That’s so much of what’s going on right now, with nonprofits and organizations making adjustments without being told to yet.”

However, documentary industry veteran Chris Hastings, who was the editor-in-chief of WGBH’s WORLD channel and is now the president and CEO of WXXI in Rochester, New York, said public television stations remain independent and should not have to cave to federal mandates. “We don’t make editorial decisions because a funder tells us to,” he said.

“We’re not owned by NPR or PBS,” he said. “We’re in partnership with them, but we’re a nonprofit. We have a community advisory board, a board of trustees, and most public media stations are the same way. And that’s the beauty of the system. These community-based stations are serving local audiences, and it’s the audience who owns it, and it’s their local donations that help sustain the station along with national investment from the federal government. My hope is that, whatever changes are happening in D.C., the mission can sustain; the money can fluctuate, but the mission needs to stay the same.”

If the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is entirely defunded, Hastings is clear. “It doesn’t mean we have to shut down. It would be a huge cut, and we would have to evaluate our services. But for those people feeling the squeeze, we just need to make sure we keep capturing the truth. We need to keep rolling the tape.”

Many documentary organizations supporting marginalized groups are trying to lay low for now. But they also recognize “that we can’t just run and hide,” said another executive director. “We have to stick together and figure out the money part. But some people aren’t going to make it, and there is going to be some genuine hardship.”

Arts nonprofits and documentary filmmakers are closely following the shifting guidelines around anti-DEIA directives for federal funding organizations such as the National Endowment of the Arts and the National Endowment of the Humanities. NEA spokespeople recently held public information sessions that suggested its grants are open to applicants from diverse groups, such as American Indian or Hispanic-serving institutions, for example. Organizations must also sign a kind of anti-DEI loyalty pledge, an “assurance of compliance,” which ensures applicants “will not operate any programs promoting ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI) that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws, in accordance with Executive Order No. 14173.”

Since many expect federal funding for public media to be fully cut or severely diminished, philanthropic and private donors have been given increased attention to fill the gap. Some larger institutions, such as the MacArthur Foundation, the Barr Foundation, and the Kresge Foundation, have doubled down on funding and commitments to DEI, while others have stayed muted.

A leader in the nonfiction nonprofit sector said it’s too early to tell what major philanthropists might do, although one of their funders is now giving less to all their grantees.

“Will people step back from film and head to frontline orgs more?” they said. “What will happen to the stock market and economy? Funders stepped up during COVID. Will that happen again? I’m definitely concerned, and I know others are, too.”

While some suggest that U.S.-based documentary filmmakers might seek funding help overseas in international co-productions, veteran documentary producer and consultant Louise Rosen is quick to shut down the idea.

“There are rumblings of funding cutbacks in many countries,” she said. “Under such circumstances, international support for U.S. projects seems unlikely and potentially highly controversial. The funding priority must be to homegrown productions. And besides, because of our historic lack of federal and regional indie film funding, with few exceptions, US makers have never really had much to reciprocate with nor have they actively cultivated those relationships.”

Rosen, formerly interim director of the International Documentary Association, acknowledges that international colleagues in the documentary world know that most American documentary filmmakers do not support the current Administration. She said, “There is some resentment not dissimilar to the feeling many here have towards the Democratic party… ‘How did you let this happen?’ So I won’t be surprised by implicit or explicit boycotting of U.S. films.”

https://indiewire.com,How the Adorable Creepers Became the Driving Force of Bong Joon Ho’s ‘Mickey 17’,https://www.indiewire.com/features/craft/mickey-17-vfx-interview-the-creepers-bong-joon-ho-1235102806/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 20:00:00 GMT","Bong Joon Ho loves a critter. The director continues his embrace of adorable animated creatures in “Mickey 17,” his sci-fi film about Robert Pattinson’s “expendable,” reprinted protagonist, who befriends the strange Creepers on the ice planet Niflheim. They are under attack by fascist Mark Ruffalo, who has come to colonize their planet.

The early design of the Creepers evolved considerably between Bong and creature artist Hee Chul Jang (“Okja” and “Snowpiercer”). First, they were insect-like, then they were flat like skatefish. But when thinking about 3D animation, the flatness didn’t translate well and looked bad. So the Creepers took on elements of rhino, walrus, millipede, and squid while retaining the inspect-quality of a caterpillar.

The Creepers come in three sizes: the giant, furry mama queen, the smaller juniors, and the cute babies, both of whom roll around and follow the mama. The challenge was obtaining the right look, functionality, and performance in animation (a collaboration between DNEG and Framestore). Dan Glass, who served as production VFX supervisor (“Okja”), helped achieve a workable model for animation with early tests that made them bigger and bulkier. The added weight improved how they moved.

“There’s a certain amount of Bong’s storytelling which leaves the origins to mystery, but they’re essentially vegetarian, peace-loving animals,” Glass told IndieWire. “ We used references from rhino, for the skin and the texture. Obviously insects and early, primitive sea fish and the way they open up, and insect legs from millipedes. And the fur, especially in the snow, was referenced from bison, and the way that the snow kind of patches and lingers in there.”

Understanding weight and movement was especially important. How do they roll or scurry about? “We did tests as a centipede, we did tests that were quadrupeds, which was adopted for the juniors because when they’re doing their big circle around the ship, the actual leg motion is more like a quadruped,” Glass said. “Their legs gather in groups at the front and at the back so they can kind of gallop. It became important for them to move quickly. If you’ve got a lot of legs, you don’t typically move very fast.”

What Glass enjoyed most was making the Creepers appear scary and threatening at first, but then revealing how kind and adorable they really are. Bong, who meticulously storyboards everything, encouraged individual bits of business that were hand-animated (Framestore handled the interior scenes while DNEG oversaw environments and crowd animation).

“In South Korea, people love to watch movies over and over again,” added Glass, “so Bong is very keen to put things in that you see only on the second or third time.”

For example, in the ship’s situation room, there is a shot that pans to the main monitor, which shows the mama dropping back down to her regular position. On the left is a junior that still has the “zipper” effect of its mandibles closing and opening, and, for a moment, a baby Creeper is revealed inside it. Blink and you miss it.

Bong’s dry wit is on display when the Creepers encounter the wounded Mickey 17 stranded in their ice cave and drag him out rather than eat him. “As one of the juniors jumps onto the mama and rolls off, he kind of tumbles and comes up to look at him,” Glass said. “They regularly bump into others and go flying, so that’s another thing if you watch and re-watch, you’ll see these little clumsy incidents happening a lot of the time.”

However, when they’re up on the crevasse and the mama slips and falls, Glass discussed with Bong if they were being too playful. “Because isn’t that meant to be when they’re sort of horrifying?” he said. But Bong liked that there was an edge of playfulness already.”

The end battle between the Ruffalo-led colonists and the Creepers was the only time that the director turned from storyboard to previs to plan it out. This was shot at Cardington in the U.K. (first converted for use on “Batman Begins,” which Glass supervised), where the team built out the ice planet with white screens. This was much better for matching cinematographer Darius Khondji’s lighting.

For on-set interaction with the actors, the VFX team went old school with the help of Stitches and Glue. They made a puppet-like stand-in for a baby with a 3D-printed face that was the proper weight to hold, and something larger and more creative for the mama. There was a 3D foam printout for the head on top of a pole and a lightweight scaffold structure for the back. This was operated by three puppeteers. It was like a Chinese dragon without the overlay, but was very versatile to move around.

They also used space hoppers and yoga balls for the smaller Creepers. “We always wanted to find a way to get a space hopper,” said Glass. “They’re basically the right height and space hoppers have ears you can hold, so that’d be easy. I thought they’d be good because you can cart them around, and just pop them where you need to. But, as Robert was between these things, he got all these yoga balls rolling across, and he had to literally weave between them.”

The final animation of the Creepers, who swarm the ship by the thousands to retrieve their baby held captive, is a joy to behold. “We obviously built a number of model variations, just in size, and then some texture on top of that,” said Glass. “But the biggest thing that I worked hard on with the team was to give them all animation variants.

The mama has one bit where she has to move quickly, right at the end, to get the baby. But, with a lot of legs, there was no way that would work so they trimmed a few. “It worked, but it’s still a bit of a cheat with half-sliding,” added Glass.

“But when you’ve got a crowd of that size, texture, and geometry variation quickly just merges,” he continued. “All too often with those kinds of large crowds, you can see the run cycles, and they’re just on repeat. And we put a lot of care into making sure that you never felt a repeated run cycle, which is quite a challenge. Every shot, even in the crowd, has a bunch of individual animations. As they’re talking about their mama, there’ll be one that sort of stops and puts their head up, looks around, and then drops down. This adds some individuality.”",indiewire

https://indiewire.com,‘Bonjour Tristesse’ Trailer: Chloë Sevigny Disrupts a Holiday in Twisted Coming of Age Adaptation,https://www.indiewire.com/news/trailers/bonjour-tristesse-trailer-chloe-sevigny-1235104337/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 18:29:34 GMT","The melancholy of coming of age is captured in the whimsically dark “Bonjour Tristesse,” based on Françoise Sagan’s 1954 novella whose title translates to “Hello, Sadness.”

“Palm Trees and Power Lines” standout star Lily McInerny plays 18-year-old Cécile who is vacationing with her father Raymond (Claes Bang) and his lover Elsa (Naïlia Harzoune). However, their summer takes a twisted turn when Anne (Chloë Sevigny), a friend of Cécile’s late mother, drives down from Paris to pay the family a visit.

As the synopsis teases, “Cécile’s world is threatened and, desperate to regain control, she sets in motion a plan to drive Anne away with tragic consequences. The three embark on an incredible journey of deceit, lust, compassion, and unconditional love against the backdrop of an unforgettable French summer.” Aliocha Schneider also stars.

“Bonjour Tristesse” is writer/director Durga Chew-Bose’s directorial debut; the film premiered at 2024 TIFF.

The IndieWire review compared the cold lushness of “Bonjour Tristesse” to a “memory,” with Kate Erbland writing, “It’s as if we’re trapped in a photo album of whatever Cécile happens to remember from that summer, a mish-mash of delightfully hazy moments and stilted, mannered lines. [Director] Chew-Bose leans heavily on not just the look of this season, all gorgeous light and perfect framing, but also its sounds. Butter scraping a piece of toast. A knife cutting cleanly through an apple. A smacking kiss. It doesn’t feel quite real, nor does it feel connected on a scene by scene basis. It’s whatever has drifted into Cécile’s mind, which we come to suspect is quite empty.”

The review continues, “Chew-Bose’s power lies in her patience, as her script isn’t at all afraid to lull her audience into a state of not quite boredom, but at least ennui (the French! again!) before oh-so-gently steering us into a much more shocking, and ultimately satisfying space. While much of the film seems to be filtered through the haze of memory (and, later, regret), the emotions at its heart slowly click into place over the course of the film. The lessons, too.”

The film is produced by Babe Nation Films’ Lindsay Tapscott and Katie Bird Nolan, and Elevation Pictures.

“Bonjour Tristesse” premieres May 2 in select theaters from Greenwich Entertainment. Check out the trailer below.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,"‘Baby Invasion’ Trailer: Harmony Korine Harnesses AI for an Unsettling, Infant-Faced First-Person Shooter Game",https://www.indiewire.com/news/trailers/baby-invasion-trailer-harmony-korine-1235104333/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 17:43:43 GMT","Harmony Korine‘s multimedia design collective EDGLRD may be a fresh-faced company, but the director is taking it one step further by using baby faces for AI avatars in his latest feature, “Baby Invasion.”

The ultra-realistic, multiplayer FPS game (which is also billed as a film) follows a group of mercenaries using baby faces as avatars to conceal their identity. The official synopsis reads: “Tasked with entering mansions of the rich and powerful, players must explore every rabbit hole before time runs out. As players navigate this dark web-leaked game, the boundaries between the digital and the real world blur.”

“Baby Invasion” made its world premiere out of competition at the 2024 Venice Film Festival, where IndieWire film editor Ryan Lattanzio wrote in the review that Korine’s pioneering vision purposefully subverts any audience expectations.

“Harmony Korine is going to do whatever the hell he wants, and in the case of his disturbing and anti-audience movie ‘Baby Invasion,’ he turns the trigger-junkie protagonist at the top of a video game into the eyes and ears of a motion picture,” Lattanzio wrote, “if that’s what you call this disquieting and sickeningly compelling new project, framed from the perspective of an assassin pillaging shiny happy McMansions in Florida. […] ‘Baby Invasion’ has a clear focus: It’s to make you, the viewer, feel bad, and often wanting to beg to the screen, ‘Please god let this end,’ or perhaps more aptly, ‘end me.’ Here is a filmmaker who, these days, resents his own audience. Here is a movie for no one.”

Lattanzio continued, “‘Baby Invasion’ is not interested at all in what you think about it. This film does not care if you watch it, react to it, or even if you are alive or dead. Its disregard for the audience is gutsy on Korine’s part, a filmmaker who has long not just pushed buttons, but shoved them down your stupid throat and then smashed your trash head against the wall while daring you to look away even when you physically can’t, as much as you might crave to.”

Korine’s divisive “Aggro Dr1ft” was the first EDGLRD release; it too debuted at Venice during the 2023 festival.

“[If] you’re not messing with the form a little bit, then what’s the point?” Korine told IndieWire of both “Aggro Dr1ft” and “Baby Invasion,” adding, “We’re making films now in gaming engines and working on a movie now that takes place in your living room, or in your bedroom. A horror film where the characters pop out of the closet. We’re at a place now where the level of tech is really starting to parallel my dreams. And this idea of world creation, and even what comes after linear cinema is exciting. You try and imagine ‘How do you deconstruct it, how do you mess with it? How do you create mini worlds?’ But doing a lot of that in rooms with our coders and VFX and artificial intelligence. It does tell a story, but it’s really meant to wash over you. It’s closer to ‘How do you create a digital hypnosis or a tech drug?'”

https://indiewire.com,"In ‘The White Lotus’ Episode 5, Things Get Predictably Messy at the Full Moon Party",https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/shows/the-white-lotus-season-3-episode-5-review-1235103593/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 02:00:00 GMT","[Editor’s note: This review contains spoilers for “The White Lotus” Season 3, Episode 5, “Full Moon Party.”]

In “The White Lotus” Season 3, Episode 5, Lochlan (Sam Nivola) poses an existential question to brother Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger): What if this life is all a trial, a chance to become better people?

Saxon dismisses him quickly, underestimating little Lochy as usual. Because if life is a test, he’s not only expecting but hoping to fail. Saxon’s entire blustering persona — finance bro, unlicensed sexpert, protein aficionado — could be put into evidence for his misunderstanding of life’s value, and he’s not exactly equipped to have that kind of epiphany, least of all during a cross-faded full moon party that gets out of his control.

After a slow start, “The White Lotus” delivers Mike White‘s version of an action-packed episode with this fifth installment, and it’s the most interesting hour by far for Schwarzenegger’s character. Despite all the fronting, Saxon isn’t taken seriously by most of his nuclear family, which probably extends to a lot of people elsewhere in his life. His attachment to Lochy is entirely contingent upon the younger brother hanging on his every word and twisted idea — or at least putting on a convincing show of it. Lochlan’s “One day, I’m gonna take you down” is so disquieting, dismissed no sooner than it’s uttered, but definitely worth noting. He plays the baby brother card strategically, and no one ever suspects him. When he takes the drugs, he follows up by telling Saxon, “Don’t be mad.” Not “Please don’t be mad,” and not a question: a statement. A command.

So while Saxon thinks the full moon party is his chance to take control and finally be the respected older brother, the sexy desirable guy, he’s at Lochlan’s mercy, which is terribly fascinating. There’s a moment on the beach when Lochy ruffles his brother’s hair, and Saxon closes his eyes almost as if Lochlan’s a lover. Whether this came from Schwarzenegger or White, it’s masterful. Saxon has spent so long projecting who he wants to be that he probably can’t tell how much of it is real. His deluded swagger masks deep insecurity, and if the audience sees through it, we can bet that people in his life do, too. He’s constantly talking and bragging about sex but not necessarily having any (and pointing the finger of involuntary celibacy at his sister). All of this comes through in that hair ruffle, a rare moment of authenticity for him. He’s rightfully uncomfortable when Lochlan kisses him later, but Saxon has been projecting some weird sexual shit on his siblings this entire time.

‘The White Lotus’ Fabio Lovino/HBO

Somewhere off the White Lotus property, Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan), Laurie (Carrie Coon), and Kate (Leslie Bibb) are having a night to remember (or to forget, if I counted right). Kate embraces the Cancun energy until she can’t anymore, but by then, the other two are trying to set a new record. Jaclyn is dying to act out. When she thinks the girls at the club recognize and are whispering about her, she responds by dancing even more suggestively (with a man who it turns out they know). This is just a blip of bedlam to tease what she gets into back at the villa, sleeping with Valentin (Arnas Fedaravicius) after constantly nudging Laurie toward him — including just a few minutes prior, when he and his friends left!

But let’s not skip ahead, because the trio truly have a night for the books. Jaclyn is on her solitary sojourn into mayhem, while Kate maybe gets a reality check that she doesn’t want this. And then there’s Laurie, who will never voice or even acknowledge her inner desire to be the focal point of the group, but relishes the opportunity. Just look at that light in Coon’s eyes when Jaclyn says, “You guys look amazing!” This woman has been begging for a compliment since Episode 1! She’s got Valentin’s attention and the girls’ approval; she takes that extra shot at the table and eats up the cheers it receives; and she’s so loose and comfortable back at the resort that she takes her top off.

Everything about the night is expertly directed by White and edited by Scott Turner. By the time Kate sits horrorstruck by the pool watching her friends swim and scream and flirt with strangers, it’s put together in such a way that she could be shockingly witnessing the events of the full moon party in tandem. There’s unease in every shot, cut, and beat of music. Cinematographer Ben Kutchins catches a chilling glimpse of Laurie’s top floating forgotten through the pool water.

But the episode ends with Timothy (Jason Isaacs) in more danger than anyone else. He writes a note to his family and holds a gun to his head before Victoria (Parker Posey) interrupts, and White closes out on the man alone and praying for guidance.

Superlatives

Most likely to die: Sorry to be boring, but it just does NOT look good for my girl Belinda (Natasha Rothwell).

Horniest: Lochlan, I fear.

Least likely to die: Tim, because he was about to and he didn’t. If the next few episodes are a prolonged journey to his suicide, I will be having words with White.

Most sus: Greg (Jon Gries) was not in this episode, so we’ll go with Jaclyn for obsessing over Laurie and Valentin and then sleeping with him herself.

Best line reading: Rothwell for “I mean, he killed his wife.” Since this is a new one, honorable mentions from previous weeks include “How wonderful for you, how wonderful for you,” (Morgana O’Reilly as Pam), “Whatchu dreamin’ bout, Pornchai?” (Rothwell again), and “Sawadee never” from the one and only Walton Goggins.

Watch the trailer for the film below.

Co-written by the original film’s scribe James Schamus and also starring Han Gi-Chan, Joan Chen, and Oscar-winner Yuh-Jung Youn, the official synopsis for the film reads, “‘The Wedding Banquet’ follows a chosen family of four friends each struggling to navigate their adulthood responsibilities and relationships. Angela (Tran) and her partner Lee (Gladstone) have had repeated unsuccessful IVF treatments, and the financial strain is worsening. Min (Han) and his commitment-phobic boyfriend, Chris (Yang), can’t agree on taking their relationship to the next level, but Min’s student visa is running out. In an attempt to solve the friend group’s ever-growing problems, Min proposes marriage to Angela to secure his green card in exchange for funding Lee’s IVF treatment. When Min’s skeptical grandmother makes a surprise visit and insists on an extravagant wedding, the friends’ commitment to their scheme — and to one another — begins to waiver.”

“The Wedding Banquet” had its premiere at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. In our review of the film, IndieWire said, “The story begins conventionally, churning out exposition to introduce the foursome. And for a while, each couple scarcely amounts to more than a broad stroke and a conflict. Lee is a charmer eager for her in vitro fertilization treatments to result in pregnancy, while the crankier Angela worries that her strained relationship with her mother (Chen) might impact her own parenting skills. The rudderless Chris and trust-fund endowed Min, meanwhile, are navigating Chris’s reluctance to commit to a marriage that would allow Min, who’s in danger of losing his green card, to stay in the country.”

Speaking to IndieWire at Sundance, Gladstone shared that she was able to influence not only how her character is presented but even her name. Originally supposed to be called Liz, Gladstone got Ahn to change it to Lee to honor the Indigenous community in the film’s setting of Seattle.

“I decided that, because it takes place in Seattle, [and] there is a significantly underrepresented tribal entity fighting for federal recognition, that is Chief Seattle’s [Si’ahl’s] nation, Duwamish,” the actress said. “Aren’t currently federally recognized as a tribe, they’ve been trying to be … for some time. So, art is transcendence, it’s how we shape societies, it was important for me to make my character Duwamish. A Duwamish person on Duwamish land has not really been seen in cinema before.”

https://indiewire.com,Jenna Ortega Probably Won’t Return to the MCU After Her ‘Iron Man 3’ Experience: ‘I Count That and Then I Move On’,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/jenna-ortega-iron-man-3-role-1235104293/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:23:24 GMT","Jenna Ortega isn’t looking to join the MCU any time soon — especially after an uncredited role in “Iron Man 3.”

The “Wednesday” actress told ET in the video here that she has been there, done that when it comes to the MCU, even if her role in the 2013 franchise installment was uncredited.

“I did it once,” Ortega said when asked if she would want to be in a Marvel film. “It was one of my first jobs I ever did. They took all my lines out. I’m in ‘Iron Man 3.’ I take up the frame. I have one leg. And I’m the vice president’s daughter.”

She added of the experience, “They even took my name away. I count that, and then I move on.”

Ortega’s “Death of a Unicorn” co-star and MCU “Ant-Man” actor Paul Rudd seemed flummoxed at how Ortega was uncredited in her bit part. Rudd, who was interviewed alongside Ortega, cited how “lucky” Marvel would be if Ortega led one of their films.

“Marvel is very good at laying those bread crumbs and so it might very well be that you come back,” Rudd said to Ortega. “They are going to create something for you because they should be so lucky to have Jenna Ortega in their franchise.”

In the meantime, Ortega is focusing more on her scream queen status than any possible superhero roles. Ortega told Collider that “Wednesday” Season 2 is like Tim Burton’s version of “Full Metal Jacket,” with other references including “Carrie,” “Prom Night,” and Burton’s own “Beetlejuice.” (Ortega also starred in its 2024 sequel “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.”)

“Visually, I can say we have some of the most fun we’ve ever had,” Ortega said of collaborating with director Burton again for “Wednesday” Season 2. “I feel like we kind of had a little bit more trust, and therefore, we felt like we could do bigger, more elaborate sequences, which is nice.”

https://indiewire.com,Gaspar Noé to Serve on Jury of Runway AI Film Festival,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/gaspar-noe-runway-ai-film-festival-1235104053/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","Gaspar Noé has never been a filmmaker who shied away from controversy, and he’s ready to wade into what might be the most divisive topic in Hollywood: AI.

The Runway AI Film Festival has announced that Noé will serve on the jury panel of its upcoming third edition. The annual festival, which will be held in June 2025 with events in both New York and Los Angeles, celebrates short films composed of generative AI. The event has grown quickly since its inception in 2023, receiving 300 submissions for its first festival and 3,000 in its second year. Noé will serve on a Jury Panel that also includes Tribeca Enterprises CEO Jane Rosenthal, IMAX Head of Post and Image Capture Bruce Markoe, and Lionsgate Senior Vice President of Visual Effects Brianna Domont, among others.

“I am both very happy and proud to have been invited to join the jury for Runway’s 3rd annual AI Film Festival,” Noé said in a statement provided to IndieWire. “Discovering the work that’s been made with this new technology is fascinating. I am always beyond curious to see how young filmmakers are now reinventing the art of visual storytelling with these incredible tools.”

“Gaspar’s work is legendary, and having him join the AIFF jury is an honor,” Runway Studios head Jamie Umpherson added. “At Runway, we’re constantly pushing the boundaries of storytelling and creativity, something Gaspar has always done with his films. His eye for talent and embrace of new technologies fits perfectly with AIFF’s ethos.”

In addition to his new AI gig, Noé is also hoping to dip his toes into some new genres of filmmaking. In a November 2024 interview with Variety, the filmmaker explained that he’d be open to making a children’s movie in the near future.

“The main film genres that really would interest me for a future project are documentary, war film, and horror. Probably I should even try to mix those three genres,” Noé said. “I also would like to do a movie with young children, or a movie for children.”",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,The Original ‘Looney Tunes’ Cartoons No Longer on Max,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/looney-tunes-cartoons-removed-max-1235104278/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:47:24 GMT","The original “Looney Tunes” has been removed from the streaming platform Max.

Since March 16, the “Looney Tunes” cartoon shorts series (1930-1969) has been pulled by the Warner Bros. Discovery streamer. The iconic Warner Bros. cartoon franchise has already been chipped away at by conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery after the corporate merger: “Looney Tunes” live-action hybrid film “Coyote vs. Acme” was scrapped by WBD in 2023 before the film was set to start streaming on Max, taking a $30 million tax write-off instead. WBD later announced that it had no plans to ever release the $70 million movie, and instead, the film was made available to be sold to another interested studio. The film was not picked up elsewhere. WBD’s decision followed the similarly scrapped films “Batgirl” and animated feature “Scoob! Holiday Haunt.”

A source close to WBD explained that the company has been publicly trying to step away from children’s programming, such as “Looney Tunes” and “Sesame Street” (which was not renewed on the platform), due to low viewership on Max. Instead, Max is prioritizing adult and family content.

WBD did, however, recently succeed in selling another “Looney Tunes” film, “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.” Indie distributor Ketchup Entertainment acquired the critically acclaimed feature, which then made history as the first fully animated feature-length “Looney Tunes” film to ever be released in theaters. The film was originally commissioned for HBO Max.

There are other “Looney Tunes” still on Max, though, via Deadline: “Looney Tunes Cartoons” (2020), most of the first two seasons of “New Looney Tunes” (2015), “Baby Looney Tunes” (2002), “Tiny Toons Looniversity” and its spinoff “Tiny Toons Looniversity: Spring Break” (2023), “The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries” (1995), and ” Bugs Bunny Builders” (2022). The podcast “Looney Tunes Presents: Bugs and Daffy’s Thanksgiving Road Trip” is also on Max.

Meanwhile, there is still a push for “Coyote vs. Acme” to be distributed in some capacity. Will Forte, who starred in the shelved movie, said it was “fucking bullshit” that “Coyote vs. Acme” will not be viewed by audiences. “It deserves so much better than it got,” Forte told MovieWeb. “I can’t tell you possibly why the decision was made to not release it. But it makes my blood boil. […] I don’t want people to forget what [Warner Bros.] did to this.”

The film was directed by David Green and written by Oscar-nominated “May December” scribe Samy Burch; James Gunn produced the feature and also received a story credit. John Cena and Lana Condor co-starred with Forte.

Forte previously took to Instagram in early 2024 to say that he “fucking hate[d]” that the film was scrapped. “Super funny throughout, visually stunning, sweet, sincere, and emotionally resonant in a very earned way. As the credits rolled, I just sat there thinking how lucky I was to be part of something so special,” Forte wrote at the time. “That quickly turned to confusion and frustration. This was the movie they’re not going to release?”",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,"SXSW Says Its Music Fest Will Continue in 2026, and Even Have One More Night of Showcases Than Before, Despite Second Weekend Being Dropped",https://variety.com/2025/music/news/sxsw-says-music-festival-will-continue-1236339587/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 19:39:04 GMT","After some confusion in news media and social apps about what will be happening with the music part of South by Southwest in 2026, the festival is clarifying the status of SXSW Music. According to spokespeople, the show will very much go on next year, albeit with some differences that may take a moment for longtime festivalgoers to wrap their heads around.

The first distinction from this and other past years is that the second weekend of SXSW, which has been devoted exclusively to its music offerings, has been dropped. But reports that this means an end to SXSW Music are not correct. Festival spokespeople say that they are moving up all the music showcases to be completely concurrent with the film/TV part of the festival that has become more dominant over the years.

And in fact, they maintain, there is a way of looking at it as being as much of an expansion as a contraction, because there will now be music showcases spread across seven nights instead of six.

Popular on Variety

How that will play out next year, with the music part of the multi-discipline festival happening simultaneously with the bigger draw that the film festival has become, remain to be seen. But the word for now is that the bell is not tolling for SXSW Music.

A statement provided Monday to Variety from Lillian Park, VP of communications for SXSW, laid out the thinking for the whole of the festival going into 2026, a couple of days after the ’25 edition wrapped up.

“We are really excited about the plans for SXSW 2026. With the Austin Convention Center closing down for three years, we believe it’s a great opportunity to put new ideas into action,” the statement said.

“A shorter SX gives attendees more of a chance to be here for the entire run. With the Conference, Film & TV Festival, and Music Festival all taking place concurrently over seven days, everyone will have the chance to experience the whole of SXSW,” it continued.

“This gives music fans an opportunity to enjoy seven nights of showcases instead of the six we’ve had for several years. It also allows us to continue the work the Music Festival programmers have done over the last decade in paring down the numbers of showcasing artists while spreading the shows out over a greater part of the event. This creates a more curated experience for attendees and artists while retaining the discovery that the music festival is known for.”

In conclusion, the SXSW statement said, “We also know that post-pandemic attendees want more personalized experiences, and we’re excited to explore new ways to bring people together.”

Just to make things perfectly clear, the spokesperson included an updated graphic for 2026 that illustrates how the three traditionally distinct parts of SXSW will now all happen across the same board at the same time, from March 12 through March 18 of next year:

Confusion began to spread Sunday after SXSW released its dates for 2026 and the traditional all-music second weekend of the festival was notably missing. Nevertheless, the festival site also showed that music-only passes for next year had already gone on sale… at a much lower cost than the asking price for film/TV-only passes.

Attendance for SXSW’s music offerings has declined over the years from its 2000s-era peak, although many bands and indie labels still consider it a vital stop. The festival used to host more than 2000 acts over a period of a few days, but has leveled off to closer to 1000. Only 2026 will tell whether the experience becomes even “more curated,” as the statement puts it, even with performances being spread over seven nights instead of six.

Penske Media, the parent company of Variety, has held a 50% interest in the festival since 2021.",indiewire

Kramer, who began his career in the UTA mailroom, will succeed Zimmer as CEO on June 1.

Zimmer had been CEO since 2012, and a stalwart agent for a lot longer. He has been grooming the well-respected Kramer for this ascension for some time. As CEO, Kramer will oversee all strategic planning and operations of the company’s global business. Zimmer will partner with Kramer to support UTA’s long-standing planned succession process in the role of Executive Chairman through year’s end. He will continue to serve on the company’s board of directors, which is headed by Paul Wachter.

Said Wachter: “We are thrilled to announce David as UTA’s next CEO. He is stepping into this role at an exciting time of growth, with UTA at the center of some of the most pivotal cultural moments across media, sports, and entertainment. We are confident that his leadership and client-centric approach will position the Company for continued success. I’ve known Jeremy and UTA for almost 30 years and have been impressed with Jeremy’s entrepreneurial nature and vision. It’s been remarkable how much the Company has grown and succeeded over that period. Jeremy’s years of dedicated service have left a strong and dynamic foundation for the Company’s future.”

Watch on Deadline

Zimmer has led the agency’s evolution from boutique literary agency into a much broader global enterprise with expansion into music, sports, publishing, fashion and beauty, creators, and brand advisory. While CAA and WME have long been regarded as the biggest agencies, UTA has positioned itself as a solid No. 3, and has kept pace with the expansion of those others through a combination of organic growth and 19 strategic acquisitions. That includes two major music agencies, publishing firm Fletcher & Company, UK talent and literary agency Curtis Brown Group, and global football agency ROOF. UTA’s partnership with Klutch Sports has grown to represent professional athletes across the NBA, WNBA, MLB, and NFL. In addition, UTA was the first agency to launch a creator group, dedicated to digital talent and podcasting. To power that growth, UTA has gone through three rounds of outside institutional investment.

“These 35 years at UTA have been so incredibly rewarding,” said Zimmer. “While transition is never easy, this particular moment feels very right. David has been my chosen successor for many years and I’m certain that he will continue to uphold our great culture, support our amazing colleagues, and honor the privilege of serving our clients.”

Zimmer outlined his own plans in an email to staff that Deadline obtained, and it is evident that retirement isn’t in his immediate plans:

“I’m proud to announce that David Kramer will be the CEO of UTA beginning in June,” Zimmer wrote. “After helping to ensure a smooth transition, I will be moving on professionally. It has always been my hope and plan for David to succeed me and seeing that vision come to life is incredibly gratifying.

“The fact that I am ready for my next challenge doesn’t obviate how hard it will be to not walk in every morning to a place I love. I will miss the deep sense of pride and belonging I have felt as part of the UTA family for the last 35 years.

“I know that the time is right, the company is well positioned for its next phase of growth. We have successfully navigated both transformative and tumultuous times, and much of that is with David’s steady influence. I have been an agent for 45 years, and it’s now or never to see what else I will do. I’ve always been a builder, and I want to take the time to create something meaningful in this next chapter of my career.

“For the next several months I will be completely available to help transition divisions and relationships to the colleagues who will assume new responsibilities. I will also be available for lunches, laughs, and any sort of questions or concerns that I can be of help with.

“Let’s be honest, the chances that I’m going to start an aluminum company in Alaska or a cement company in Cleveland are pretty slim. So this is not goodbye. I will remain on the board, and I will always be a friend, a supporter, and a fiercely loyal champion of this great company we’ve built together and that I love.

“Special thanks to my fellow board members for all the good times and support. My fellow founders — Jim Berkus and Peter Benedek, who have been great friends and wonderful mentors, even when I was a terrible mentee. I love you guys.

“And most of all, my deepest love and gratitude to UTA — to our extraordinary clients, our incredible colleagues, and the unwavering culture of believing in and fighting for artists’ dreams. UTA will always be part of me.”

In the agency’s announcement, Kramer said he was “honored to serve as the next CEO of this incredible Company and work with our talented team of agents and executives who, unlike any other, prioritize clients above all else, and share a commitment to delivering tailored, impactful opportunities. Thanks to Jeremy’s vision and leadership, UTA has not only grown, but evolved into a more diversified, dynamic company, expanding into new areas, while strengthening our core business. Our complementary businesses are positioned to take advantage of an everchanging environment and I look forward to building on our momentum to advance the UTA platform.”

Kramer has been the agency’s president since 2022. He worked his way up from the bottom, ending his mailroom stint with a promotion to agent in the motion picture department. In addition to representing a strong list of writer-director-producer clients, he distinguished himself as a strong strategic thinker who has guided the agency’s day-to-day business and helped shape its strategic growth in the filmed entertainment group, which includes motion picture literary, television literary, talent, production arts, and independent film, as well as the comedy touring and publishing divisions. Along the way, he has been a driver in the agency’s strategic growth including helping to bring strategic investor EQT to UTA and leading UTA’s acquisition of top UK literary and talent agency Curtis Brown Group.

O’Donnell will play Captain Don Sharpe, “a rugged fire captain and rodeo rider who runs Nashville’s busiest firehouse with his beloved son,” according to the official character breakdown. “Don’s a devoted husband and family man but he has his secrets.”

The man is no stranger to network procedurals: He previously played Special Agent in Charge Grisha “G” Callen on aforementioned NCIS: LA. 9-1-1: Nashville marks his first series-regular gig since the CBS procedural wrapped its 14-season run in 2023. Additional TV credits include Bupkis and Grey’s Anatomy.

9-1-1: Nashville is being executive-produced by Ryan Murphy, Tim Minear, former 9-1-1: Lone Star showrunner Rashad Raisani, Brad Falchuk and Angela Bassett. No further casting has been announced as of press time.

9-1-1: Nashville — Everything We Know View List

ABC handed the Music City-set offshoot a series order in February. Minear previously explained to TVLine that there were two reasons why Nashville was chosen: “One, I think that it’s a really interesting city with its own personality,” he said. “It’s very unlike Austin. We did kind of a red state 9-1-1 [with Lone Star], but Austin is a very blue town. Nashville felt even a little bit more Southern. It also has the country music industry, and it just felt like it could be a fun place to set a piece of the franchise.”

The second reason is a bit more practical. “Quite frankly, Tennessee is very production-friendly,” Minear explained. “That also factored into our reasoning. There are some states that you think would be fantastic places to set the show, but it’s just not cost effective to do it.”

He also chaired the committee that put them in.

North Carolina was one of a few teams “on the bubble” heading into Sunday night’s selection show. The Tar Heels finished the year 22-13, but were 1-12 in “Quad 1” contests, their most difficult games. When the final conference title games had ended on Sunday, ESPN’s bracket expert had UNC on the outside looking in.

Instead, the Tar Heels were the last team selected for the 68-team field. They face fellow No. 11 seed San Diego State in the First Four on Tuesday.

It’s a win for the school, for the ACC and also for Cunningham. For having a team make the field, North Carolina’s AD will receive one twelfth of his annual base salary, which is $814,868, according to his contract. That $67,905 bonus is for “overload duties, work and responsibilities related to” the NCAA Tournament, the contract says. Cunningham made the same when the North Carolina women’s team received a No. 3 seed.

When Cunningham signed that deal, he was in the middle of a five-year term to serve on the NCAA’s Division I men’s basketball committee, which selects the field of 68. That process includes a stated policy of having the AD of any school (or commissioner) leave the room when his or her teams are being discussed, and to abstain from any voting.

In a televised interview Sunday night on CBS, Cunningham said he recused himself for all discussions involving the Tar Heels.

“Obviously, I’m going to defer that” to committee vice chair Keith Gill, Cunningham said. “But all the policies and procedures were followed and Keith can address exactly how North Carolina was discussed because I was not in the room for any of that.”

Gill, who is commissioner of the Sun Belt Conference, then said that he “managed all the conversation that we had about North Carolina,” and confirmed that UNC was the final team selected for the field. Had Memphis lost to UAB in the American title game on Sunday, UNC would not have made the bracket.

West Virginia governor Patrick Morrisey, who said Monday that he would consider legal action against the NCAA over WVU’s exclusion from the tournament, hinted at Cunningham’s conflict of interest. In a post on X, Morrisey wrote: “There’s clearly some home cookin’ going on in North Carolina.”

A representative for UNC didn’t respond to questions about the bonus or the potential conflict. A representative for the NCAA didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on whether committee members are compensated.

The 12-person committee is a mix of conference commissioners and athletic directors. The only others whose teams received at-large bids were Alabama AD Greg Byrne and West Coast Conference commissioner Stu Jackson.

Cunningham’s five-year deal, signed in 2022, pays him $814,868 per year with a hefty amount of additional compensation, including a $110,409 retention bonus every three months. In addition to the bonus for making the men’s basketball tournament, Cunningham is in line to make more if the men’s team makes a run. He’ll make $50,000 if they reach the Sweet 16, $75,000 if they make the Final Four, or $100,000 if they win a national title.

UNC head coach Hubert Davis also received a bonus for making the tournament. According to his contract, which started last July, he will receive $100,000 for playing in Tuesday’s game. The school also receives payment via the ACC through the tournament’s complex “units” payout system.",indiewire

Schwarzenegger also looked dapper in a tuxedo. He grabbed Champion’s leg, and she wowed in a white bridal corset and satin shorts.

“Katie says, ‘I wish we could have seen Haley reading a letter from Lucas just to hear what was going on in their lives. We don’t hear from Lucas until the last season. What would y’all imagine Lucas, Peyton and Sawyer are up to?’” Lenz, 43, read aloud during the fan question segment of her and Bush’s “Drama Queens” podcast.

Lenz and Bush — who played Haley and Brooke respectively — drew a blank about what happened to the duo’s characters.

“I don’t even remember where they moved,” Lenz said. “Where did they go?”

Related: Hilarie Burton Morgan Wasn't Asked Back for 'One Tree Hill' Season 7 Hilarie Burton Morgan is recalling how she and One Tree Hill costar Chad Michael Murray found out they weren’t returning for season 7 of the long-running series – and fans are surprised by her candid admission. During the Sunday, May 19, episode of her “Drama Queens” podcast, Burton Morgan, 41, told cohosts and former costars […]

Murray and Burton Morgan played love interests, Lucas and Peyton. In season 6, they got married and welcomed a daughter named Sawyer. At the end of the season, the family of three left Tree Hill behind and drove off into the sunset. However, the show never explained why.

“I don’t know why they left and where they moved,” Lenz shared. “Did Lucas get [a job?] ‘Cause he can write from anywhere.”

While Bush was unsure of the exact storyline, she believed that it might have had something to do with their characters going across the country.

“I feel like I remember a West Coast thing or that they wanted to travel while he wrote his next novel,” she said. “This is the problem, they didn’t give us enough to make [sense] of where our friends went.”

Lenz echoed similar sentiments stating she had “no idea” what happened.

“Who knows? Did they start a new life in Maine or in Napa? Are they renting a trailer just driving around the country? Did they move to Europe?” she theorized. “Where are they?”

Which Is the Best Teen Drama of All Time?

Bush brought up that texting was coming into play at the time, so it would have been easy to keep Murray and Burton Morgan’s characters in the show’s universe.

“I know we brought this up with the powers that be at the time, but I feel like it was more of personal beef than anything that made sense for our characters, which is unfortunate,” she claimed. “I used to ask and be like, ‘Why can’t Brooke be getting text messages from Peyton? Why can’t you see them texting? Like why am I not getting photo updates of this baby?’ It feels really weird.”

Lenz agreed it was strange for the show to not bring up Lucas or Peyton again especially when One Tree Hill’s “world was built around” their relationship.

“It’s like trying to prove that the show could go on without them and it did, but it could have made more sense,” she said. “And [it] would have been more nice to just have their presence still around in some way.”

Murray, Burton Morgan, Bush and Lenz all starred on One Tree Hill when it premiered in 2003. Murray and Burton Morgan exited the series after six seasons. It was reported at the time that Murray’s departure was due to contract negotiations and a desire to pursue other projects. Burton Morgan, for her part, left to pursue other opportunities. In May 2024, Burton Morgan revealed that neither herself nor Murray were offered season 7 contracts.

Following Murray and Burton Morgan’s exits, One Tree Hill continued for an additional three seasons. Before the show wrapped up in 2012, Murray made a brief return in season 9.",usmagazine
https://usmagazine.com,Gene Hackman's Will Does Not Mean His Kids Are Disinherited: Expert,https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/gene-hackmans-will-does-not-mean-his-kids-are-disinherited-expert/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 20:26:20 GMT","The late Gene Hackman only named late wife Betsy Arakawa in his will, which has raised some major questions about his three kids.

“We have no reason to believe that they were disinherited from the trust,” attorney Allison E. Zinn, who specializes in trust and estate litigation, told Us Weekly exclusively. “Not yet anyway.”

Us confirmed last week that Hackman’s will, which hadn’t been updated since June 2005, left his entire estate to late wife and successor trustee Arakawa. Some reports have speculated that because Hackman’s three children — Christopher, 65, Elizabeth, 62, and Leslie, 58 — were not listed as beneficiaries (they are noted as next of kin), they will not inherit any of his fortune. That is not accurate, at least according to Zinn, who does not represent any party in this matter.

“A lot of people, kind of, have this situation wrong. His will leaves his estate to Betsy as trustee of the Gene Hackman trust. So, it doesn’t just leave it to her as an individual. It leaves it to a trust,” Zinn explained to Us. “When you leave something to a trust, it goes into the name of the trustee, and it’s administered in accordance with the terms of the trust. As far as I know, the trust document has not been made public.”

Related: Gene Hackman's Estate Asks to Block Release of Investigation Records The estate of actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, is seeking to keep sensitive images from the investigation into their deaths out of the public eye. Multiple outlets reported that a legal petition was filed at the First Judicial Court in Santa Fe County on Tuesday, March 11, to prevent the Santa Fe […]

Essentially, Hackman’s trust could leave some or all of his $80 million fortune to his three children. (Hackman shared his kids with late ex-wife Faye Maltese.)

“It’s possible that [Arakawa] would’ve been a beneficiary when he died and then when she passed away, his children could be the heirs,” Zinn continued. “But we don’t know that as we sit here. Everything that’s in his estate is going to go to that trust.”

Zinn explained that she doesn’t see “any issues” at the moment with Hackman’s will.

“I don’t know why the kids would want to challenge the will because it doesn’t affect them, other than to leave his entire estate to the trust,” she explained. “The real question is who are the [trust’s] beneficiaries?”

She noted that since they are listed as next of kin, they will be notified of all court proceedings related to Hackman’s estate.

Us confirmed on February 27 that Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 64, were found dead at their Santa Fe home. Their causes of death have since been revealed with authorities confirming that Arakawa died first from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Hackman died a week later, on February 18, from hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with Alzheimer’s disease as a significant contributing factor.

Related: Medical Examiner: Gene Hackman Might Not Have Known Wife Betsy Had Died New details about the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were revealed in a Friday, March 7, press conference. “Mr. Hackman probably died around February 18,” Dr. Heather Jarrell, chief medical examiner for the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, explained. “Based on the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that […]

It was initially reported by New Mexico medical examiner Dr. Heather Jarrell that Arakawa died on February 11, but the date of her death has since been called into question.

“Mrs. Hackman didn’t die on February 11 because she called my clinic on February 12,” Dr. Josiah Child told the Daily Mail in an interview published on Sunday, March 16. “She’d called me a couple of weeks before her death to ask about getting an echocardiogram for her husband.”

Dr. Child, who runs Cloudberry Health in Santa Fe, claimed that Arakawa made an appointment to come in later that day.

“We made her an appointment but she never showed up,” he alleged. “She did not show any symptoms of respiratory distress. The appointment wasn’t for anything related to hantavirus. We tried calling her a couple of times with no reply.”

“I have had a lot of time to reflect and realize that life is short and precious,” Cauthen, 39, said in an emotional statement shared via Instagram on Friday, March 14.

The country music star’s representatives originally announced on February 6 that Cauthen was “leaving the road” immediately in order to prioritize his “mental and physical health.” Cauthen remained silent on social media for over a month before releasing a video detailing his recent health problems.

“I know I’ve kind of been blacked out, you know, not really present online. Just know that it’s been for the right reasons,” he insisted.

The Sons of Fathers member opened up about the lengthy process of receiving a cancer diagnosis, revealing he had first battled pneumonia for weeks. Cauthen recalled “taking a bunch of steroids” to try to get through his tour, but woke up one night to find he was “blue in [his] lips and white in [his] face.”

“It scared the hell out of me,” he admitted.

At that point, Cauthen canceled the remaining dates on his Black on Black tour so he could undergo a full battery of medical tests back home in Texas.

The singer shared with his fans that he has a treatment plan in place and a positive prognosis, vowing […]

“I kinda shook myself, you know, and listened to myself for the first time in a long time,” Cauthen said.

A few weeks after getting off the road, Cauthen had “a bunch of scans done” at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, where he was initially told most of his tests came back “clear.” Doctors found “one little hot spot” that needed further examination, but upon review, they discovered a mass in his thyroid.

“They told me that it is papillary carcinoma and that it’s cancer,” Cauthen confirmed. “Looking back at it all, slowing down and taking some time to get healthy and getting off the road, actually probably ended up saving my life.”

He went on: “I have had a lot of time to reflect and realize that life is short and precious. Just know that I thank you so much for unwavering support through it all.”

Cauthen vowed that he will “tour again” and “sing on stage again,” adding: “I’m not done, by any means. I’ll have new music.”

“I’ll keep on writing and keep on doing what I know I need to do,” he promised. “I know that I’m a vessel on stage and that God has me here for a reason.”

Paul’s wife, Elizabeth Cauthen, shared a photo of the couple kissing via Instagram on Friday, March 14 in the wake of his public diagnosis confirmation, along with an empowering message: “There ain’t nothing we can’t beat as long as we’ve got each other.”

The singer also received an outpouring of support from the country music community, including “Pay Gap” artist Margo Price who wrote via Instagram: “Sending you all the love and prayers. Love you so much brother Paul.”

Elle King also offered supportive words: “We love you Paul.”

The “Cocaine Country Dancing” musician was only five shows into his Black On Black Tour when his spokesperson confirmed he was stepping away from the stage in February.

“We all love Paul very much and we are very happy and relieved that he has made this decision to put himself first,” his representatives said at the time. “It is obviously necessary to cancel all of his shows for the foreseeable future and each venue will be able to provide information on cancellations and refunds.

Manager Dave Roberts said on Monday, March 17, that Betts, 32, would not play in the two-game Tokyo Series against the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday, March 18, and Wednesday, March 19. (Miguel Rojas will start in Betts’ place.)

The short stop is reportedly feeling better but has lost nearly 15 pounds and is trying to stay hydrated and gain strength back. Roberts noted that Betts may fly to the U.S. before the team to rest for the domestic opener on March 27.

“The thing is when you lose a lot of weight, when you’re dehydrated, that’s what opens a person up to soft-tissue injuries,” Roberts said, per MLB. “We’re very mindful of that. So to take the next week, call it, to build him back up, his strength, do some baseball activities to get ready for the home opener.”

Betts began suffering from symptoms at the MLB team’s spring training home in Arizona the day before they left for Japan. While Betts boarded the plane, Roberts said that the athlete wouldn’t have traveled if the team knew how long he’d be recuperating. Betts reportedly tried to workout on Sunday, March 16, but quickly became tired.

Betts previously gushed in January that he had an “awesome” time during a separate trip to Tokyo, Japan, for a baseball camp with kids. “Had a great time in Japan!” he captioned his Instagram post at the time. “All the experiences were a blast but nothing compares to spending time with kids and seeing them have fun enjoying the game we all love!

During a recent episode of her “Are You a Charlotte?” podcast, Davis, 59, recounted the scene during a discussion with Christine Taylor, who pointed out that Davis’ character, Charlotte, was the one who actually gave the slip its now-famous moniker.

“[You] nam[ed] it the naked dress,” Taylor, 53, said, to which Davis replied, “I know! It kind of is.”

Davis also added: “And then Miranda says, ‘It’s tits on toast,’ which is also kind of hysterical and pretty accurate.”

Related: Carrie Bradshaw’s Most Iconic ‘Sex and the City’ Outfits Sex and the City fans love to say that New York City is the show’s fifth main character, and if that’s true, then fashion is the sixth. Legendary stylist Patricia Field served as the show’s costume designer, earning an Emmy for her work on the series in 2002. Sarah Jessica Parker, who played leading lady […]

Lest you forget, episode 6 of season 1 opens with Carrie dressed in a beige slip mini — an itty-bitty dress by DKNY with transparent spaghetti straps and a dangerously low back.

The sex columnist is posing for a photo shoot for her new ad, which will later be plastered on the side of an M11 bus. Of the shoot, Carrie says: “I had misgivings, which were somewhat nullified when they told me I could keep the dress.”

Weeks later, Carrie wears the dress again, this time to her first-ever date with Mr. Big. Ever the supportive friends, Charlotte, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) are there for Carrie’s send-off. Naturally, they debate whether Carrie is going to sleep with Big in it.

That’s when Charlotte coined the term. “Let’s just say it, it’s the naked dress,” she says, before warning Carrie that she shouldn’t sleep with Big if she’s serious about dating him. (Even Miranda agrees.)

Related: Carrie! Charlotte! Miranda! ‘SATC’ Cast Has Red Carpet Reunion Calling all Sex and the City fans! Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda (also known as Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon) took a break from filming their HBO spinoff series to hit the red carpet — and, fittingly, looked the part of their fabulous onscreen counterparts. While the iconic trio has been busy shooting […]

In the podcast, Davis gave props to a line delivered by Samantha: “Then Samantha says, and [this is] very, very smart, ‘You can still get dumped on your first date or your 10th date whenever you have sex,’” she recalled. “And this is a good point, Samantha.”

Though Carrie throws a fur coat on top of it, Mr. Big simply calls it an “interesting dress” when he sees her — and, spoiler alert, the two ultimately end up in bed together. Of Mr. Big’s reaction, Davis and Taylor both shared a similar thought when looking back on the scene today: “Ew, that’s, like, so smug!” Taylor said.

But back to the episode: It all goes downhill from there, and Carrie assumes Big is ashamed to be seen with her in public. She even pins it on the outfit: “I don’t blame myself, I blame the dress.”

However, the infamous dress found a life outside of the show. Parker, now 59, donned the same DKNY dress for the 1997 VH1 Vogue Fashion Awards in New York City, which took place at Madison Square Garden.

Related: Carrie Bradshaw’s Iconic ‘SATC’ Tutu Sells for Astonishing Amount of Cash HBO We couldn’t help but wonder how much a Sex and the City fan would be willing to pay for Carrie Bradshaw’s iconic tutu — and now the answer has arrived. After the tutu worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in the SATC opening credits went up for auction last month, it recently sold for $52,000. […]

Adding her own touch to the look, she wore the itty-bitty slip and styled her hair in a classically ’90s updo. She grounded it with near-identical nude strappy sandals, like her character’s Manolo Blahnik shoes from the series.

The naked dress not only drives the episode’s entire plot, it’s essentially its own character. Even today, as Davis’ latest podcast episode proves, it is still one of the most iconic and talked-about garments on Sex and the City. It paved the way for other women to make similar sexy statements on the red carpet.

As Taylor said of Carrie’s look, “She [looked] like a million dollars.” From the pared-down silhouette to the lack of jewelry and the nude sandals, the barely-there dress was peak ’90s minimalism — and you can’t put a price on that.",usmagazine

After sparking romance rumors in January 2023, Hudson confirmed her relationship with Belichick in October 2024. The couple made their first red carpet appearance that December during a gala at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.

Hudson has continued to share her relationship with Belichick on social media — and has also jumped to her boyfriend’s defense when online commentators often make jokes about their age difference.

“Let’s take a deeper dive into the hot topic of the day… ‘LOVE’…,” she wrote via Instagram in February alongside a photo of her and Belichick. “‘What constitutes love?’ or ‘what makes someone worthy of loving?’ are questions that require a deep analysis and could possibly enable one to understand the romances that they may not understand nor relate to.”

The cheerleader noted that “with such a limited character count” she couldn’t go into full details, but she would “exclaim a few basic concepts.”

“There is no objective criteria for what constitutes someone’s worthiness of love,” she wrote. “We do not need to justify ‘why’ we love a particular person. The ways in which we develop our biological preferences are deeply personal in which we owe no justification nor explanation. Love does not discriminate against sex, skin-color, religion, age or ability. Love does not fluctuate along with someone’s body weight.”

Hudson goes on to list that love “does not lie within a perfect complexion” and “is not as deep as one’s pockets.”

“Love does not look the same every time you see it. People and relationships, like everything else, are impermanent; even though love is eternal,” she concluded her post. “Love is not to be judged. It is never okay to harass or abuse a person based upon who they love.”

“Hey everybody, so, I guess you could say our family has been through something pretty traumatic over the weekend,” Lowe, 41, said in a Monday, March 17, Instagram post. “I’ve debated on whether or not we should share this publicly, but I just figured you guys are going to ask questions and probably see things, so I might as well get out ahead of it.”

Giudici, 38, appeared beside Lowe in the video, appearing visibly emotional as she wiped tears from her eyes.

“On Thursday, I was having some friends of mine over to barbecue. Catherine took the kids to the mall, and we’re just barbecuing here on my patio, and it was a really nice night, so I had the doors and windows open, and some of the smoke from the barbecue started to drift inside, and our smoke alarm started going off,” Lowe recalled. “So I grab a dish rag and I’m going over to waft the smoke away from the smoke alarm, because the siren was insanely loud. And as I’m holding the dish rag, Moose comes up and, like, bites it and kind of nips my finger really aggressively, which is something that he does not do. So, you know, I kind of gave him a, ‘No Moose.’”

Lowe explained that Moose began biting his feet so hard that the dog “put holes” in his shoes.

“At this point again, there’s so much chaos going on with the alarm going off, I give him like a very stern like, ‘Moose. No. No.’ And it was right about that moment where he shows his teeth at me and just attacks me, and I don’t mean like bite and run off like a lot of dogs do when they’re scared or defensive. I mean, attacks me, and I feel him just kind of ripping into the flesh of my arm,” Lowe recalled. “And at this point, I am doing everything I possibly can just to fend this dog off.”

Lowe noted that he was “bleeding badly” but was able to get the dog into the backyard.

“He comes back through the door and attacks me for a second time, and not trying to be dramatic, but I honestly just felt like I am fighting for my life here against a dog,” he said. “Not just a dog. My dog, right? Like, he’s my dog. We’ve only had him for a little under three months, but like he’s my dog.”

There is no stronger bond than that of a human and their pup — and Chris Evans and his dog, Dodger, are prime examples of this dynamic. The Avengers star first met his sweet mixed-breed boxer around the time he was filming his 2017’s Gifted. He shared a video of their initial introduction […]

Lowe looked down at his arm and claimed that the cut was “so deep” that blood was “squirting” for a couple feet.

“My first thought is, ‘I think that dog may have nicked an artery.’ And we have the video, which — the video is way too violent. I’m not going to share that, but you hear me saying, ‘This is serious. You got to get me to a hospital. Call Catherine.’ And I thank God that my friends were there, because they were able to rush me to the ER.”

Now at the ER, Lowe received stitches in “five or six different places” on his arm. When he returns to his home, Lowe’s friends corralled Moose into the backyard and had cleaned up the “literal pool” of blood in his home.

The next morning, Lowe knew he couldn’t keep Moose in the house due to his young children’s safety. While he began researching “the best plan of action,” Lowe’s parents came to the house to take the children. (Lowe and Giudici, who tied the knot in 2014, welcomed sons Samuel and Isaiah and daughter Mia in 2016, 2018 and 2019, respectively.)

“I’m waiting in the front yard for my parents to show up with the kids. They show up, and we’re getting the kids in the car so that they can go with them, and the next thing I know, I hear a ‘No, no, no, no.’ And it’s Catherine from inside the house,” Lowe said. “And I look at the front door because I’m standing in the front yard, and I see Moose running out the front door.”

Lowe explained that the pair have double doors that blew open from wind, leading Moose to get out.

“Going through a dog attack is pretty darn traumatic,” Lowe said. “Having to relive it less than 12 hours later, seeing that dog running straight at you is a feeling that I don’t think I ever want to experience again. Not to mention my arm was just useless because it was all stitched up and having a hard time moving it. And so there’s a split second where I’m looking at him and I’m just praying, like, ‘Please let it be the friendly Moose that I know.’”

However, Moose “made a beeline” at Lowe and began attacking him again.

“Just again, feeling ripping into my flesh. And again, I’m not trying to exaggerate, I certainly don’t want to come across as, like, a victim or anything like that. I’m just telling you how it happened,” Lowe said. “And so I’m able to wrestle him to the ground. And this dog is so strong, he’s so explosive, but I’m able to wrestle him to the ground. I’ve got a hold of his collar, but I know that he’s ripped my arm open, and I just know, like I’m fighting for my life here, like I feel like if this dog gets up, he is going to kill me.”

While his family called 911 and a neighbor took the couple’s kids into their home, Lowe said he laid on Moose for 10 minutes.

“It took everything I had to control this dog. And like I’m 220 pounds. If it were anyone else, he would have killed my children or my wife, but I was able to hold him for 10 minutes until the cops came, and then the cops had a hard time getting control of him.”

Lowe returned to the ER to receive more stitches.

“We’ve been really transparent over the years on social media. Like I said, you guys I’m sure would ask questions about Moose, or where is Moose or why are your arms disfigured?” Lowe said. “So I just wanted to let you guys know what had happened. But overall, I’m super thankful it was me.”

Lowe noted that it wasn’t Moose’s “fault,” claiming that the dog “experienced a lot of trauma” before the family adopted him, leading him to flip a switch into “an absolute killer.”

“We miss our dog as weird as that sounds. He was a really, really good dog,” Lowe concluded. “And we miss him.”

“Our family has been through it the last few days but we’ll be okay. Thank you to everyone for the support,” Lowe captioned the post. “We’re very grateful.”

The couple welcomed Moose into their family in January. “Everyone, please welcome Moose! 🐾,” Lowe and Giudici wrote in a joint Instagram post at the time. “Santa and Daddy took the kids’ requests for a dog for Christmas into consideration. We are happy to add this 7 year old (we think) rescue boxer into our zoo. We hope he loves us as much as we have already grown to love him.”

They continued, “*Banjo was not his original name, it was the name given to him by the shelter that he didn’t respond to. We tried to call out common boxer names to see if any were ones he responded to and Moose was something we all thought he liked ❤️.”

https://usmagazine.com,Justin Baldoni’s Lawyer Addresses Possible Blake Lively Settlement,https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-baldonis-lawyer-addresses-possible-blake-lively-settlement/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 17:34:47 GMT","Justin Baldoni’s attorney, Bryan Freedman, is responding to predictions that his client’s legal battle with Blake Lively will be settled before trial.

While appearing on the March 12 episode of “The Town” podcast, host and former lawyer Matthew Belloni asked Freedman how long the case can go on for.

“I do not believe there will be a trial in this case,” Belloni, who is a founding member of the Puck newsletter, predicted. “I just think that the potential for the circus and the damage to both sides here will ultimately win out and you guys will settle. So if that’s the case, why not just settle now? What is the number? What would it require for this to go away?”

From Freedman’s perspective, he’s not sure if “circus” is the right word to describe the case.

Related: ‘It Ends With Us‘ Legal Battle Is Getting the Documentary Treatment Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni’s legal drama is getting the documentary treatment. England’s ITN Productions is behind a new 90-minute documentary titled He Said, She Said: Blake Lively vs Justin Baldoni, which is set to air on the U.K.’s Channel 5 on Monday, March 17. “Produced by ITN’s transatlantic team this special is a timely […]

“You keep referring to it as a circus and I get it. You see a lot of cases. You see a lot of things, but the reality is this is not a circus when you go through an experience like this,” he explained. “I’ve represented a lot of people in the worst moments of their career, the worst moments of their life. Justin has been destroyed by this.”

Freedman said the allegations are “a really serious thing” and it’s important that the truth is revealed.

“In this day and age, the only way that you can truly get back is to prove your innocence and that’s what we’re actively working to [do],” he shared. “That may only be able to be done in a courtroom.”

Baldoni’s life has been put under the microscope ever since Lively, 37, filed a legal complaint against him in December 2024, accusing him of sexual harassment during the filming of their movie It Ends With Us. The actress also claimed that Baldoni, 41, attempted to launch a smear campaign against her.

Baldoni denied Lively’s allegations and filed his own lawsuit against the Gossip Girl alum, her publicist, and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, in January.

He is seeking $400 million in damages after accusing the trio of civil extortion, defamation, false light invasion of privacy and other claims. Lively and Reynolds, 48, deny his claims while Lively’s publicist has asked to be removed from Baldoni’s lawsuit.

Before Baldoni and Lively’s trial is expected to begin in May 2026, Baldoni and his team launched a website with the URL of “thelawsuitinfo.com” to allow the public to access an “Amended Complaint” and “Timeline of Relevant Events.”

“The website is actually a culmination of public pleadings that are publicly accessible and had been filed and they are easily accessible,” Freedman shared with Belloni. “It’s a place where you can find things.”

Freedman supported the website after The New York Times broke the news that Lively was planning to sue Baldoni.

“The minute The New York Times story came out, Justin was done for all intents and purposes,” Freedman claimed. “The court of public opinion was against him. There was no side that he had in this. There were no facts that were on his side. … It was really important to come out with real, true facts.”

The New York Times has since stood by its reporting of the Lively and Baldoni case. The publication has also filed a motion to dismiss Baldoni’s claims against them.",usmagazine

“Mrs. Hackman didn’t die on February 11 because she called my clinic on February 12,” Dr. Josiah Child told the Daily Mail in an interview published Sunday, March 16.

Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their Santa Fe, New Mexico, home on February 26. After an investigation, authorities announced on March 7 that Arakawa died at age 64 due to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Meanwhile, Hackman, who was 95, is believed to have died about a week later due to hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with Alzheimer’s disease as a significant contributing factor.

Arakawa was planning a heart scan for her husband prior to their deaths. “She’d called me a couple of weeks before her death to ask about getting an echocardiogram for her husband,” Dr. Child claimed. “She was not a patient of mine, but one of my patients recommended Cloudberry to her. She made an appointment for herself for February 12. It was for something unrelated to anything respiratory.”

Us Weekly confirmed on February 27 that Hackman, Arakawa and one of their dogs were found dead at their Santa Fe home the previous day. The Academy Award winner was 95 while his wife was 64. Hackman’s family later […]

Dr. Child, who runs Cloudberry Health in Santa Fe, said she canceled her appointment on February 10. She explained that Hackman was sick. “She called back on the morning of February 12 and spoke to one of our doctors who told her to come in that afternoon,” he explained.

However, Arakawa never arrived, and the team never heard from her again. “We made her an appointment but she never showed up,” Dr. Child alleged. “She did not show any symptoms of respiratory distress. The appointment wasn’t for anything related to hantavirus. We tried calling her a couple of times with no reply.”

Officials stated that they were estimating Arakawa’s time of death based on the information they had. Security footage showed her running errands on February 11 and returning home.

Dr. Heather Jarrell, chief medical examiner for the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, explained at a March 7 press conference: “Based on the circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that Mrs. Hackman died first, likely around February 11.”

The medical examiner said it was difficult to say whether a heart attack caused Hackman’s death but noted he’d had many heart attacks and heart procedures over the years. Dr. Jarrell added that Hackman’s Alzheimer’s disease was severe: “I can tell you that he was in an advanced state of Alzheimer’s and it’s quite possible that he was not aware she was deceased.”

Hackman, who is survived by three adult children, left his $80 million estate to Arakawa in his will. It is unclear what will happen to the estate.",usmagazine

“Today we have a guest that I’ve been following on Instagram for a couple years now,” Shepard, 50, said on the Monday, March 17, episode of the “Armchair Expert” podcast, before talking to cohost Monica Padman. “This is fun because you were on the fence about Andrew, about some of his comedy. And before he came, I said, ‘Come on in. We’d love to have you, but there’ll be some pushback.’ So this was a very unique and fun episode. You guys got to really hash it out.”

Shepard explained that this episode was “really political” despite the podcast typically trying to “avoid politics.”

“I was like, ‘There’s no way we do this without going all in,’” Shepard recalled. “For me, it was very fun because we never do it. And also in the middle of it, I was like, ‘Yeah, this is why we never do it.’ Because we’re getting very granular about this policy or that and this year and whatever. But I thought it was thrilling to sit kind of on the sidelines and watch the whole thing.”

Kimmel began poking fun at Rodgers, who played for the Green Bay Packers for 18 seasons before joining the New York Jets in April 2023, after the NFL player came under fire for being dishonest […]

In the episode, Schulz’s unfiltered humor was on full display. While discussing his new Netflix comedy special, Life, which addresses his journey to fatherhood with wife Emma, Padman asked Schulz about his joke about special needs children.

“I can say it because they’re my embryos,” Schulz, 41, said of the R-word adding, “If I have r—— embryos, I can call them whatever I want. They’re mine.”

Padman pointed out that Schulz doesn’t have a child who has special needs, and could cross paths with an upset parent who saw the joke at his daughter’s school.

When Padman asked whether he would “care” about a viewer being upset, Schulz replied, “Well it depends how they feel about it. If they see it and they’re like, hey, that really hurt me and made me feel really uncomfortable. Then in that personal interaction, I’ll feel bad that somebody was hurt by it, a person. … I don’t feel bad about people telling me to feel bad on behalf of people that we don’t even know if they feel bad.”

Elsewhere in the podcast, the trio began discussing trans rights.

“There’s a thing that people don’t say, which is, ‘Should they compete against [cis] women?’ … No. But we can also say, ‘It sucks for them. That is so unfortunate that you’re in that situation,’” Schulz said, to which Shepard replied, “Let’s make a category. I actually am supportive of their right to compete, and I acknowledge that they’re a woman. I want that right for them, but not at the expense of 20 other people.”

Schulz noted that “there’s not even a room on Twitter for the little bit of empathy in the middle” when discussing these issues.

“So it seems so rigid and harsh, and we’re getting things in 180 characters, or whatever the character limit is, there’s room to be like, ‘Man it sucks as that person.’ Because I do believe that there are trends with things. So I think that there are some young kids that are probably identifying as trans that might not actually be not only trans. … And then there are people who are trans. My guess is that competing in the Olympics is not even the top 100 of the things that those people care about. … And now they’re the talking point of every show, and they’re just out here going, ‘I’m just trying to be a barista at this thing and everybody who comes up wants to ask me if I should be a swimmer.’ And you’re like, ‘I don’t give a f— about swimming.’”

For Schulz, he “loves” having conversations with people who share different views than him because his opinions “get sharper.”

“I’m like, ‘Oh, I’m hitting this too bluntly and I’m ostracizing all these people. I would do that with the trans athlete thing. I didn’t have space for how much it must suck to be a trans person and not having anywhere to go, and just acknowledging that makes my opinion way more digestible.”

Schulz also addressed his friendship — or lack thereof — with Shepard’s friend Jimmy Kimmel, whom he recalled was having a back-and-forth interaction with Aaron Rodgers. (Kimmel and Rodger’s feud dates back to 2021, but was reignited in 2024 when the NFL player insinuated that the late night host should be worried about the names on Jeffrey Epstein’s list. Kimmel slammed the allegations and threatened to take legal action. Rogers later said he wasn’t “accusing” Kimmel of being on the list.)

“I felt like he started with jokes, and then Aaron had a joke, and then I think Jimmy got some real life circumstances that affected him. I think he got some death threats and that kind of s—,” Schulz explained. “There’s a lot of crazy people out there. Then he made it not about jokes. I was like, ‘Yo, you opened the door with jokes.’ He responded with jokes. And then you were like, ‘What you’re doing is dangerous.’”

Schulz continued, “Jimmy is always someone who I’ve looked at and admired. He has iconic TV shows, comedy history. That to me, I felt a little let down. You clown this guy on national TV, on one of the biggest shows, he clipped you back. To me, I’m like, ‘That doesn’t seem fair.’”

Schulz may not also have a fan in Shepard’s wife, Kristen Bell. Shepard recalled the couple, who tied the knot in 2013, attending Schulz’s show — and one joke that didn’t land.

“I had Kristen on board, she was on the Andrew Schulz f—- train. And then this joke about abortion, you lost her,” Shepard recalled, to which Schulz replied, “Yeah, it wasn’t a good joke. … It didn’t have the silliness of the joke.”

Schulz explained that the idea behind the joke was “how many abortions is too many” for one person. “If it goes to, like, 20, I think that there has to be an intervention where it’s like, ‘Alright, we gotta do something here.’ The idea is the beginning of a joke. Making it silly is a joke,” Schulz said, to which Shepard explained Bell took issue with men not being included in the joke.

As they continued to discuss his controversial humor, Shepard said the first time he became “scared” for Schulz was during an alleged feud with Kendrick Lamar.

“He put out an album, and he had a line in it. He was like, ‘Don’t ever let no white comedian talk about no black woman, that’s law,’” Schulz said, claiming he “got confirmation” the line in Lamar’s “Wacced Out Murals” was about him. “I didn’t respond for weeks. I had to shoot my special, I didn’t really care. That wasn’t even the thing that bothered me about the line.”

Schulz continued, “The next line is, ‘And to the n—– that coon, the n—– that bein’ groomed, slide on both of them.’ … So slide is like assault or kill. I’m thinking, and the world is thinking, he’s talking about Charlamagne and Alex Media, the two Black dudes that are on the show. So once you tell people to kill my friends, you get whatever I give you.”

Schulz noted that Lamar said a “stupid thing” to him, adding, “you don’t tell your fans to kill two of my friends or slide or assault or whatever it is, even if it’s not serious, you’re putting that energy out there. So don’t be surprised if you get some energy back.”

Schulz, who responded to the song, recalled people making the reply “racism so fast.” Schulz claimed that his response was “fair” after Lamar allegedly suggested for his “fans to kill my friends.”

The reality star and the rapper, who tied the knot in 2014, share four children: North (born in June 2013), Saint (born in December 2015), Chicago (born in January 2018) and Psalm (born in May 2019).

Two months after Kardashian filed for divorce, she and West both filed for joint custody of their brood. When they settled their split in November 2022, the former couple agreed to share legal and physical custody with “equal access” to the kids. West was also required to pay Kardashian $200,000 a month for child support and is responsible for 50 percent of their children’s educational and security expenses.

Tension has grown between the exes over the years, with West claiming in October 2022 that the Kardashian-Jenner family barred him from attending Chicago’s birthday party earlier in the year.

Kim’s sister Khloé Kardashian came to her defense via Instagram at the time. “Ye, I love you. I don’t want to do this on social media but YOU keep bringing it here,” she commented on West’s since-deleted Instagram post. “You are the father of my nieces and nephews and I’m trying to be respectful but please STOP tearing Kimberly down and using our family when you want to deflect. Again with the birthday narrative. Enough already. We all know the truth and in my opinion, everyone’s tired of it.”

“That is such a typical Elliot thing,” coshowrunner Alexandra Clarke told TVLine on Monday, March 17, referring to the season finale cliffhanger. “He needs his perfect moment.”

During the March 7 finale, Elliot (Evan Williams) and Kat (Chyler Leigh) had a heart-to-heart about their relationship after his ex-wife, Emma Baker (Miranda Millar), and her lover from the 1800s, Thomas Coyle (Kris Holden-Ried), briefly derailed their modern-day romance.

“Let’s just love each other as we are,” Elliot told Kat before kissing her, after they both confessed to messing up in the past.

As they pulled apart, Kat noticed that Elliot’s father had returned his family ring. The diamond had belonged to his mother and ancestor Susanna Augustine (Watson Rose), whom Kat became close with during her time traveling to the 1800s.

“I will find the perfect moment,” Elliot revealed when asked if he was proposing. Kat kissed him in celebration, noting, “I know it’s going to be perfect.”

Clarke, meanwhile, teased that she loved the moment between Elliot and Kat, calling it “spontaneous.” However, Elliot’s desire to be “perfect” is what kept it from being a full-blown proposal.

“Them acknowledging to just start loving each other as they are, not as they were, is such an important thing for these two characters to say to one another,” Clarke explained. “Because if you really do think about it, they have been in love with their past versions, versus who they are right now, which isn’t perfect.”

She noted the characters are “flawed” and they have “burdens and trauma” which have postponed their romance more than once.

“To kind of acknowledge that and say, ‘I want to start loving you as you are now, clean slate,’ is a big thing for these two characters,” Clarke revealed.

Although Kat choosing Elliot in the present during season 3 meant leaving Thomas in the past — literally — Clarke said both types of love were important for Kat.

“The love [between] Thomas and Kat, it’s fleeting and it’s intense and it’s dangerous and it’s passionate and it’s this crazing, boiling thing,” the showrunner explained.

When it comes to Elliot, who has loved Kat since they were kids, there is a “constant.” Clarke noted, “It’s slow, it’s easy, it’s familiar and it’s safe.”

It’s just like, ‘Oh, come on!’ But that’s who they are,” Conkie told TVLine, referring to Kat and Elliot self-sabotaging on several occasions before the finale. “Who knows if they’re meant to be together, because every time they get close, something happens that makes them think they’re not perfect for each other or whatever, and I don’t know.”

Leigh, meanwhile, exclusively told Us Weekly in January that Kat and Elliot have a “Ross and Rachel” from Friends style dynamic.

“You got to have that little bit [of] back and forth. [Plus], when they live in such a fantastical world — something that is so hard to really wrap your mind around — all of a sudden, we have these characters in a place where it’s like, ‘Oh, well what do we do in real life?’” the actress said. “If one adventure seemingly ends, where do we go from here? So it’s a lot of those reality check moments that I think we don’t see what that in-between with Kat and Elliot looks like.”

While Kat and Elliot’s engagement status is on pause, fans will get to see what’s next for their love story when season 4 premieres. The show was renewed by Hallmark Channel earlier this month, but a release date for the next installment has not been announced.

Ever since the Bravo show premiered in 2006, realtors — including Josh Flagg, Josh Altman and Tracy Tutor — have allowed cameras to follow their lives as they list and sell multi-million dollar homes throughout the greater Los Angeles area.

In March 2025, however, news broke that Million Dollar Listing LA is pressing pause on the series ahead of season 16. While the show is not canceled, it’s unclear when filming will resume.

As Bravo figures out what’s next for the franchise, many agents continue to host their own open houses, get into bidding wars and work their hardest to score a deal at various agencies.

Related: MDL's Josh Altman Calls TV the ‘Greatest Marketing Tool’ for Real Estate Josh Altman had nothing but praise for reality TV after Million Dollar Listing helped his career as a real estate agent. “It’s how you use the machine of television. From day one, I was very careful about everything that I did, because I realized that if you use television correctly, it can be the greatest […]

Keep reading to see what your favorite Million Dollar Listing LA stars are up to now:

Tracy Tutor

In January 2025, Tutor announced she was leaving Douglas Elliman and taking her expertise to rival agency Compass.

“My brand has always been rooted in innovation and growth, and joining Compass aligns with my vision for the future of my business,” Tutor shared in a statement at the time. “This partnership will not only enhance my ability to serve clients in California and Texas but also enable me to expand my reach into new markets, elevate my team’s capabilities, and continue setting the standard in the luxury real estate industry.”

The best-selling author also addressed speculation that she would consider joining The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. “You know, I’ve been asked that a lot,” she said on a March 2025 episode of Jeff Lewis Live. “I mean, I would like to come for a few people on that show.”

Josh Flagg

The best-selling author of The Deal continues to be a top-selling agent in Beverly Hills while working with Compass.

Flagg works with many exclusive clients, including A-List celebrities and high-net-worth individuals. He also represents some of the city’s most notable builders, developers, business managers and attorneys.

He remains “besties” with his longtime Million Dollar Listing LA costars, including Tutor.

Josh and Heather Altman

At the end of season 15 of Million Dollar Listing LA, both Josh and Heather celebrated the opening of their new Orange County office while also vowing to prioritize family time with their two children.

In October 2024, the couple took that promise one step further when they announced their departure from the Bravo show.

“This has been something that has kind of been coming up over the past 24 months,” Josh told Us Weekly. “We can always go out there and sell houses. We can always go out there and do all these things, but we’ll never get the time back when our kids are this age.”

Both Josh and Heather remain with Douglas Elliman and continue to sell million-dollar properties in and around Southern California.

Fredrik Eklund

Although he only appeared on Million Dollar Listing LA for one full season, Eklund made quite the splash on the West Coast.

He continues to work at The Eklund and Gomes Team, which includes 97 agents in 13 offices around the world.

In September 2024, Deadline reported that Eklund was developing a new show with Evolution Media, the production company behind Vanderpump Rules and The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

James Harris and David Parnes

Million Dollar Listing LA’s dynamic duo continue to work together and sell multi-million dollar mansions. The founders of Bond Street Partners joined Carolwood Estates in February 2024 after more than a decade at The Agency.

“Reflecting on the past decade, we are humbled by the incredible growth, meaningful relationships and numerous milestones we have shared together,” the duo said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter at the time. “We express our sincere appreciation to The Agency’s leadership team and staff for their guidance, mentorship and camaraderie throughout our journey. As we look forward, we are excited to embark on this new chapter with Carolwood, a move that aligns us with like-minded professionals dedicated to excellence and client-centric service.”

Madison Hildebrand

After appearing on 10 seasons of Million Dollar Listing LA, Hildebrand stepped away from the cameras to continue focusing on The Malibu Life.

“Sharing my life, career, relationships and challenges over the past six years has been an unbelievable journey,” he shared with Bravo in June 2014, “and I loved every minute of it.”

The Malibu Life team represents a shared enthusiasm towards people, bespoke properties and the Southern California lifestyle. The team is part of the Compass family and continues to excel in Malibu and other Los Angeles-area communities.",usmagazine

“Yeah, he’s pretty pumped, but he’s always really cool,” Pratt, 45, continued.

Pratt was surprised by his son’s response to the movie.

“At the end, he goes, ‘Yeah, you made me cry.’ He goes, ‘I actually cried. I’ve never cried in the movie, I cried,’” Pratt shared with Entertainment Tonight.

“And so that was really sweet,” Pratt continued. “He’s the kind of kid where he’s not going to tell me that he’s excited, but I know he’s excited, you know.”

Without giving anything away, Pratt said his son cried because of the end of the film.

“There’s this, like, a moment at the end of the movie that that made him sad,” he teased.

In an interview with the Christian Post earlier this month, Pratt said he made a deal with God when Jack was born prematurely, weighing on 3 pounds, 10 ounces.

“He had all of these issues going on,” Pratt told the publication. “I prayed hard to God. I was in a season of transition spiritually at that time and didn’t quite fully understand. I made a deal with God again: ‘I’m sorry, God, here I am again, asking for your grace again.’”

In the image, Caselotti wore her hair in tight curls up to her shoulders.

In her selfie, Zegler wore her dark hair in a bob up to her chin, styled with a red Jennifer Behr bow, along with a gray, off-the-shoulder top. She also included a black-and-white video of the late actress, who passed in 1997 at the age of 80, emulating Caselotti, down to the tight, shoulder-length curls, the red ribbon in her hair and, of course, the delicate hand placement.

Zegler also shared a black-and-white image of Caselotti as well as a drawing of Snow White, both with ribbons in their hair.

Also in attendance was Gal Gadot, who portrays the reboot’s Evil Queen, as well as members of the film’s creative team: Marc Platt, Marc Webb, Jared LeBoff, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.

In the years leading up to the film’s release, Zegler has been the center of significant backlash involving the film, beginning in June 2021 when some fans questioned her casting as Snow White since she is Latina. She also drew criticism after a September 2022 interview with Variety where she referred to the original 1937 Snow White as “dated.”

“She’s not going to be saved by the prince and she’s not going to be dreaming about true love,” Zegler said of her character in a September 2022 Extra interview. “She’s dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be and the leader that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless, fair, brave and true.”

Late last year, Zegler shared that the backlash for the film ultimately made her sad.

“In all honesty, it made me sad that it was taken in such a way because I believe that women can do anything,” Zegler told Variety in October 2024. “But I also believe that they can do everything.”

“I would never want to box someone in and say, ‘If you want love, then you can’t work.’ Or ‘If you want to work, then you can’t have a family.’ It’s not true,” she said. “It’s never been true. It can be very upsetting when things get taken out of context or jokes don’t land.”

The latest legal war was set off after Kanye agreed in a mediation Friday not to release a previously recorded song in which their daughter North raps. The track -- ""Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine"" -- also includes a phone convo between Diddy and Kanye.

Thing is ... Kim was vehemently opposed to letting North participate in any way ... and according to their divorce settlement, they both have equal say in making decisions for their kids.

Play video content FEBRUARY 2024

Sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ, the divorce settlement provides for the event there's a conflict -- Kim and Kanye must first go to a private judge to try and hash out an agreement. Kim was there for the mediation with her lawyer, Disso Queen Laura Wasser, and his lawyer, Patrick DeCarolis, and they did reach an agreement ... North would not appear on any version of the song if it was released.

But agreements don't seem to matter with Kanye, and he released the song with North's voice over the weekend. Kanye posted to X last night ... ""THE MAN MAKES THE FINAL DECISION.""

So, here's what Kim is weighing ... Kanye rarely sees his kids, so physical custody is not an issue. In fact, Kim wants their kids to have a relationship with their dad and has almost always facilitated that. One recent exception ... when Kanye held an event where he urged participants to wear swastika shirts. She did not feel it was appropriate for her kids to attend that event.

As for legal custody, he's not that involved in decision-making, but still -- Kanye has made it clear he's not about to follow the rules of the road. So our sources say Kim is seriously considering going to court to ask a judge to strip him of joint legal custody.",tmz

The ""Baywatch"" star ventured out Friday in Calabasas ... going on a walk with a friend and keeping a low profile.

David wore a black T-shirt, black pants, and kept his mug tucked under a plain blue baseball cap ... walking down the sidewalk in sneakers.

We hadn't seen 72-year-old David since we broke the story earlier this month of his ex-wife Pamela Bach's death ... she tragically died at 62 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

David and Pamela were married from 1989 to 2006, and they had two children before a nasty divorce ... with disputes about monthly child support payments extending into 2017.

Chanel said in a statement, ""Ketamine is an extremely dangerous drug that is becoming more and more prevalent in the UK. If we can help raise awareness of the dangers of this drug and help people who may be dealing with ketamine addiction then something positive will come from this complete tragedy.""

11:58 AM PT -- Drake's lead attorney Mike Gottlieb tells TMZ ... “UMG wants to pretend that this is about a rap battle in order to distract its shareholders, artists and the public from a simple truth: a greedy company is finally being held responsible for profiting from dangerous misinformation that has already resulted in multiple acts of violence. This motion is a desperate ploy by UMG to avoid accountability, but we have every confidence that this case will proceed and continue to uncover UMG’s long history of endangering, abusing and taking advantage of its artists.”

Drake's trying to have his cake and eat it too ... according to his music label UMG, which says his whole lawsuit over ""Not Like Us"" is really just sour grapes because Kendrick Lamar buried him in their rap beef.

Play video content TMZ.com

Universal Music Group filed docs Monday in federal court, calling out Drake for his part in the diss track battle that surrounded the release of ""Not Like Us."" According to the label, ""Drake encouraged the feud. For example, when he felt that Lamar was taking too long to respond, Drake released a second recording in which he goaded Lamar to continue the public rap battle.""

Play video content Apple Music/NFL

Remember, Drake is suing his label for releasing the track, claiming it did so knowing its ""certified pedophile"" line was false and defamatory.

But, in the docs, obtained by TMZ Hip Hop, UMG points out both Drake and Lamar released a total of 9 blistering songs attacking each other -- and, ""Drake has been pleased to use UMG's platform to promote tracks leveling similarly incendiary attacks at Lamar.""

UMG says Drake's insults included claims Kendrick is a domestic abuser, and Kendrick's biz partner is the real father of the rapper's son. The label says Drake's only suing ""after losing the rap battle.""

Drake's own label says his lawsuit ""disregards the other Drake and Lamar diss tracks that surrounded 'Not Like Us' as well as the conventions of the diss track genre, and, thus, critically ignores the context of the dispute.""

Translation: Ya live by the sword, ya die by the sword, Drake!

UMG flat-out denies ""Not Like Us"" is defamatory, especially considering the context of the rap war that was raging between both rappers -- who are both UMG artists -- and, it wants a judge to dismiss the whole lawsuit.
