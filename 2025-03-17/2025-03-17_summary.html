With advances made via land, sea and air, Turkiye forges an independent path. Cuban medical missions provide crucial support to several Caribbean healthcare systems, especially in times of crisis. Observers say Trump wants to pull off a ‘reverse Nixon' by deepening ties with Russia, but is that even possible? The president has escalated his rhetoric against Iran, in the wake of a weekend of US attacks on Houthi sites in Yemen. Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>

Syrian security forces inspect vehicles at a checkpoint, following a recent wave of violence between Syrian security forces and gunmen loyal to former President Bashar Assad, as well as subsequent sectarian attacks, in Latakia, in Syria's coastal region, Tuesday, March 11, 2025. Some factions allied with the new government launched sectarian revenge attacks — primarily targeting Assad's Alawite minority sect — that monitoring groups say killed hundreds of civilians over several days. More than half will be used to help people in Syria, with other funding supporting Syrians and communities elsewhere. Jobs and cash for work programs are needed so that Syrians can start to make a living. Associated Press writers Geir Moulson in Berlin and Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this report.</p>

“It has been established that through a series of intermediaries … the organisers of these crimes are in Russia and this is connected to military intelligence and security forces,” Urbelis said. “More than one supermarket has been set on fire, and not just supermarkets,” Urbelis said when asked about whether the arson was linked to similar cases in neighbouring Poland. “Unfortunately, we have evidence that in Poland, and not only in Poland, there are several organised groups that plan and carry out acts of sabotage,” he added. Commenting on Lithuania's findings, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said it was “exceptionally perfidious” for Russia to hire Ukrainians as perpetrators of sabotage acts. Such is the nature of this state,” he added, referring to potential talks on war-torn Ukraine's fate.</p>

The US district judge James E Boasberg has scheduled a hearing for Monday afternoon to demand an explanation about why his Saturday order order temporarily blocking the deportation flights had apparently been ignored. “As the supreme court has repeatedly made clear – federal courts generally have no jurisdiction over the president's conduct of foreign affairs, his authorities under the Alien Enemies Act, and his core Article II powers to remove foreign alien terrorists from US soil and repel a declared invasion. “A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrying foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from US soil.” On Monday morning, Boasberg scheduled a 4pm hearing for the Trump administration to explain if they defied his order. A federal judge had reportedly ordered the government to provide the court with 48 hours' notice before deporting Alawieh, but she was reportedly put on a flight to Paris anyway.</p>

US president says consequences of any future attacks by Yemen's Tehran-backed rebels will be ‘dire' The US president, Donald Trump, has declared he will hold Iran directly responsible for any future attacks by Yemen's Tehran-backed Houthi rebels, who have targeted US and other foreign ships in the Red Sea. Trump's comments further escalate his administration's new campaign targeting the rebels. Airstrikes killed at least 53 people this weekend and appear poised to continue. Describing the Houthis as “sinister mobsters and thugs”, Trump warned any attack by the group would be met with “great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there”.</p>

PARIS (AP) — Hey, America: Give the Statue of Liberty back to France. So says a French politician who is making headlines in his country for suggesting that the U.S. is no longer worthy of the monument that was a gift from France nearly 140 years ago. French-U.S. relations would have to drop off a cliff before Glucksmann found support from French President Emmanuel Macron's government. Macron has let his prime minister, François Bayrou, play the role of being a more critical voice. Glucksmann's party has been even more critical, posting accusations on its website that Trump is wielding power in an “authoritarian” manner and is “preparing to deliver Ukraine on a silver platter” to Russia.</p>

Raphaël Glucksmann quips that US should give back 19th-century gift from France over Trump's approach to Ukraine Trump's White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, then responded to Raphaël Glucksmann on Monday by calling him an “unnamed low-level French politician” and saying the US would keep the statue. “So, it will be just fine here at home,” Glucksmann said. Glucksmann said France could be in a position to benefit if any of the fired workers emigrated. “If you want to fire your best researchers, if you want to fire all the people who, through their freedom and their sense of innovations, their taste for doubt and research, have made your country the world's leading power, then we're going to welcome them,” said Glucksmann.</p>

The biggest destination remains the US but many of Europe's Jewish communities have also received a significant demographic boost, with some that have been shrinking for decades due to an elderly population and a low birthrate now growing again. The researchers used new government statistics to establish a definitive figure for Germany's Israeli and Israeli-connected Jewish population after decades of only rough estimates. It's more about music, food and love of Israel as a second home for Jewish people than religion,” said Garmy, 31. Many of the arrivals from Israel are well educated, relatively young and have children in their new homes. A recent editorial in the Yedioth Ahronoth daily newspaper was entitled: “It's no wonder people are leaving Israel”.</p>

In a social media post on Sunday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova likened Sunak's position to historical acts of piracy. The assets are mostly EU, US, and British government bonds held in a Brussels-based securities depository. Last month, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that Europe should move from freezing Russian assets to actively seizing them. In response, Moscow accused London of violating international law and warned that it will have to give the money back. The US launched negotiations last month to broker peace in Ukraine, with President Donald Trump indicating that sanctions against Moscow could be lifted if a settlement is achieved.</p>

It also proposed bringing in subsidies for childcare (a financial burden cited by young adults as discouraging them from having children), unlocking earnings potential for homeowners, promoting “emerging” markets such as AI-powered products and encouraging snow and ice tourism. “By connecting consumer spending to broader social goals like elderly care improvement, childcare support and work-life balance, the plan embeds consumption growth within China's wider development objectives, signalling that consumption is being positioned not just as an economic target but as a means to enhance quality of life,” said a report in the official state media outlet, Xinhua. The plan came amid mixed domestic economic data from Beijing, as reports showed retail spending was up compared with last year, but unemployment had hit its highest level in two years and house prices had fallen in almost all medium and large cities. “The foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough,” it said. The country is facing a protracted trade war with the US, as Donald Trump flags further expanding tariffs on Chinese exports, and potentially putting pressure on other countries to place their own levies.</p>

North Macedonia's government ordered a sweeping three-day inspection to be carried out at all nightclubs and cabarets across the country, starting Monday. Former economy minister Khreshnik Beteshi was being questioned at a police station in Skopje, his lawyer Elenko Milanov told reporters. Neighboring and nearby countries — Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey — along with a number of others have already accepted some 50 patients with the most serious injuries, while several countries are also sending medical teams to North Macedonia, officials said. Beti Delovska, an economist from Skopje, said North Macedonia has never experienced a tragedy like this, with dozens of young people vanishing in minutes. She noted that many young people with bright futures had already left the nation, in search of opportunities elsewhere.</p>

Nitrogen causes death by depriving the body of oxygen, essentially causing suffocation in a phenomenon known as hypoxia. Those guidelines have been adopted into Louisiana state law, which specifically outlaws gassing as a method of euthanasia in cats and dogs.

An announcement by the justice department was expected later on Monday. The decision follows weeks of tension between Donald Trump and Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, amid efforts by Washington to broker an end to the three-year war between Russia and Ukraine. After Trump berated Zelenskyy publicly in the White House, the US suspended military assistance and intelligence sharing to Ukraine, although they were subsequently restored after Kyiv supported American calls for a ceasefire. The justice department also said it was reducing the work of its war crimes accountability team, set up by Garland in 2022 to hold Russia accountable for atrocities committed following its invasion of Ukraine. Garland said at the time that “there is no hiding place for war criminals” and vowed that the department would “pursue every avenue of accountability for those who commit war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine”.</p>

US President Donald Trump ordered a “powerful military action” against the militants on Saturday, over what he described as an “unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism.” Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz claimed the strikes “hit multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.” Additional strikes were reported by local Houthi-affiliated media on Sunday night. The group has launched numerous strikes on international shipping they believe to be linked to Israel since late 2023, in a campaign staged in solidarity with the Palestinians. The Houthis have also repeatedly conducted long-range ballistic missile and drone strikes on Israel, as well as on Western military vessels deployed into the region.</p>

While the evidence for how Covid has shaped social attitudes requires careful interpretation, research data can offer some insights. And 58% would “almost never” trust any politician to tell the truth when they are in a tight corner. There has long been evidence, for example, of disillusionment and increased social atomisation, Duffy says. Conspiratorial thoughts around vaccines have proved remarkably enduring: in January 2021, as the vaccine rollout began in Britain, 75% of UK adults told YouGov it was definitely or probably false that vaccines had harmful effects that were not being disclosed. But it's not dissimilar to lots of the other infrastructures we put in around Covid [that have since been dismantled].</p>

Human intellectual abilities such as reasoning and problem-solving are diminishing, possibly due to increased exposure to visual media, the Financial Times (FT) has reported. The reported trend comes amid a rise in artificial intelligence (AI) which, by some estimates, may surpass human IQ in a matter of years. While active, intentional use of digital technologies can often be beneficial, being passively exposed to infinite content on social media coupled with frequent context-switching has been shown to negatively impact attention span, memory, and self-regulation. Human intellectual capabilities, such as critical thinking, have also been impacted by generative AI, according to recent research by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University. AI could become smarter than humans in the next three years, tech billionaire Elon Musk warned in December, shortly after his AI company, xAI, launched its first image generation model, Aurora.</p>

It would make it an offence to hold or attend events that violate Hungary's contentious “child protection” legislation, which prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to under-18s. Pride organisers have called the prime minister Viktor Orbán's drive to ban the event a restriction of fundamental freedoms of speech and assembly. The government portrays itself as a champion of traditional family values and a defender of Christian civilisation from what it calls “gender madness”, and says its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda”. Aside from banning the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality in content available to minors – including in television, films, advertisements and literature – it also prohibits the mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programmes, and forbids the public depiction of “gender deviating from sex at birth”. In a speech in February, Orbán hinted that his government would take steps to ban Budapest Pride, which attracts thousands of participants and celebrates the history of the LGBTQ+ movement while asserting the equal rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.</p>

Members and supporters of Hungary's LGBTQ community march through Budapest, amid an increasingly hostile environment for sexual minorities led by the country's right-wing government, on Saturday, July 23, 2022. The bill would make it an offense to hold or attend events that violate Hungary's contentious “child protection” legislation, which prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors under 18. The proposal is the latest step against LGBTQ+ people taken by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose government has passed legislation that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities. The government portrays itself as a champion of traditional family values and a defender of Christian civilization from what it calls “gender madness,” and argues its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda.” Aside from banning the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality in content available to minors — including in television, films, advertisements and literature — it also prohibits the mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programs, and forbids the public depiction of “gender deviating from sex at birth.”</p>

Tensions across the two countries' porous border have been brewing since Syria's new Islamist leaders ousted Bashar al-Assad, a key ally of Hezbollah and Tehran, in December. The spasm of violence had largely died down by dawn Monday but put on display how thinly spread Lebanon's army is at a time when it is also being tasked with enforcing the conditions of a ceasefire with Israel by ensuring that Hezbollah no longer operates in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah denied the accusations, saying in a statement it “has no connection to any events taking place within Syrian territory.” Lebanese media reported that three armed men entered Lebanon first, resulting in clashes with local tribespeople who believed they were under attack. Al Arabiya, a Saudi-owned regional news outlet, said its cameraman and several other journalists sustained minor injuries reporting on the clashes.</p>

The treasurer will say ‘we deserve better as a long-term partner and ally' in major economic address on Tuesday one week before delivering budget Slamming the US president Donald Trump's tariffs as “self-defeating and self-sabotaging”, Chalmers in his speech will point to fresh OECD warnings that the world economy will grow more slowly as a result of American trade aggression. “Our response to this will not be a race to the bottom on tariffs, because more and higher tariffs would harm, not help, our workers, businesses, industries and economy.” “It's clear the rules that underpinned global economic engagement for more than 40 years are being rewritten,” Chalmers will say. December's mid-year fiscal update estimated a deficit of $26.9bn for 2024-25, although economists anticipate it will be smaller.</p>

The EU must cut its reliance on US-made weapons and prioritize European alternatives, French President Emmanuel Macron has said. In an interview with French media published on Saturday, Macron argued that the bloc's rearmament efforts would be more effective if member states stopped “buying American” and instead turned to the EU's military industrial complex. “Faced with unpredictable powers, we simply need to be less dependent on them. Macron said he plans to discuss his proposals with incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the coming days. SIPRI researcher Pieter Wezeman noted that while Europe has taken steps to boost its defense industry, reliance on American arms remains deeply rooted.</p>

The commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, conceded last week that a recession was possible, but suggested this would be “worth it”. As shown in recent polling, how a person views the economy under Trump depends on their political party. It's a sudden flip from how Republicans and Democrats viewed the economy last year while Joe Biden was president. Trump's insistence on tariffs comes in defiance of growing concerns that the policies could ultimately lead to a recession. “But there's growing concern that tariffs could have a lasting and unknowable impact on the economy, regardless of whether they're walked back soon or not.”</p>

Rwandan President Paul Kagame has highlighted Belgium's role in dividing the region during colonial rule, which led to families being separated across borders. Speaking at the Presidential Citizen Outreach event at BK Arena in Kigali on Sunday, he said, “one of the misfortunes we have is having been colonized by a small country, similar in size to Rwanda, which partitioned Rwanda to match its own size.” The president claimed that Western nations are enforcing sanctions on Kigali under Belgium's influence. When resources are limited, we rely on relentless will and courage to defend ourselves,” Kagame said. He called on the people of Rwanda to be resilient in the face of external challenges, reinforce national unity, and uphold peaceful relations with other nations grounded in mutual respect.</p>

Palestinian experts working with British archaeologists estimate that more than two-thirds of heritage, cultural and archaeological sites in Gaza have been damaged, often very badly. Close to Pasha Palace is Hamam al-Samara, a 700-year-old bath house that was among the most important of Gaza's monuments. A recent report by Palestinian conservation experts in the occupied West Bank and UK-based archaeologists estimated that just protecting historical sites from further damage in Gaza – if the current ceasefire holds – will cost about $33m and take up to 18 months. Others look to cities such as Dubai for inspiration, with a focus on towering hotels and malls, not heritage. It was expanded over the centuries and rebuilt once after being almost destroyed by British artillery targeting an Ottoman ammunition dump there.</p>

The "stagnators" are countries that remained static or made minimal progress in their rule of law indicators. The "sliders" are model democracies like Belgium, France, Germany and Sweden, demonstrating isolated but troubling declines in certain areas. Poland, meanwhile, is considered a "cautionary tale" as the new government has attempted to restore judicial independence and media pluralism without achieving major progress, illustrating that addressing the compromised independence of institutions is a highly challenging and fragile endeavour.

US President Donald Trump warned on Monday afternoon that Iran will be held responsible and face “dire” consequences for any further attacks by Yemen's Houthis. An Israeli air strike killed three Palestinian men – all from the same family – in Gaza on Monday as they tried to gather firewood, medics said. His comments come as US officials say airstrikes launched against Houthis will continue indefinitely, after a first round on Saturday killed at least 53 people and injured almost 100 more. The US president has suggested that Tehran's nuclear capabilities – which now reportedly include enough near-bomb-grade fuel to produce about six weapons - were reaching a critical point. Amid these growing tensions, it has been confirmed that Iran's deputy foreign minister, Kazem Gharibabadi, will meet UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi at the agency's headquarters in Vienna later today.</p>

An Indian historian, who has lived in UK for over a decade, is facing deportation after the Home Office ruled she had exceeded the permitted number of days abroad while conducting research in India, according to a report in The Guardian. Under UK immigration rules, applicants for ILR based on long residency must not have spent more than 548 days abroad over a ten-year period. Dutta, whose research required access to historical archives in India, was away for 691 days. “These research trips were not optional but essential to fulfilling her academic and institutional obligations,” Naga Kandiah, her legal representative at MTC Solicitors told The Guardian. “Had she not undertaken these trips, she would not have been able to complete her thesis or meet the academic requirements of her institutions.”</p>

These comments come days after the Houthis claimed a second attack on American ships in 24 hours, calling both "retaliation for deadly US strikes". Washington, D.C. has vowed to keep striking Yemen until the rebels stop attacking Red Sea shipping, with President Donald Trump warning he will use "overwhelming lethal force". A day before the two sat down to talk, Mr Trump had announced a new reciprocal tariff policy for US trade partners, among whom he had named India, China, and Brazil as countries that levy "tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them" and called this "very unfair".</p>

Canada and the European Union have already vowed retaliatory tariffs, deepening fears of an economic standoff. Economists have warned that tariffs could raise costs for consumers and strain global trade relations, to which Belfort said, "I think the only people who are panicking are probably, you know, on CNBC trying to make everyone panic."

The organisers of a marathon in southern Taiwan issued an apology on Sunday after winners were mistakenly awarded Type 95 automatic rifles-firearms used by China's People's Liberation Army- as prizes, per Taipei Times. The Fongshan Marathon, organized by Hsu's office, took place in Kaohsiung's Fongshan District, with routes passing through three normally restricted military schools: the Military Academy, the Fongshan Army Infantry School, and the Chung Cheng Armed Forces Preparatory School. "Due to the co-organizer's oversight, the trophies were mistakenly modelled after rifles not used by Taiwan's armed forces," he said, adding that steps have been taken to retrieve and replace them as soon as possible. The event's co-organizer, the Kaohsiung City Fongshan Jogging Association, clarified that the rifle-shaped design was chosen purely for its aesthetics and relevance to the military, dismissing any suggestion that it was linked to "united front" efforts. The manufacturer has been instructed to produce new trophies, and event staff will reach out to winners once the replacements are ready.</p>

The number of jobs advertised last month was more than 1.5m a slight increase on January, although newly posted job opportunities in February were 10% lower. The REC chief executive, Neil Carberry, said: “Firms have been working hard to find growth in the face of rising costs since the budget, and it is reassuring that some are now feeling more ready to hire.” Construction firms have reported low levels of activity in recent months in response to uncertainty about the outlook for housing and commercial building projects. However, plans by the government to boost housing starts, lower interest rates and rising property prices have meant firms are now hoping to increase capacity and hire more workers. He said a sustained recovery in IT recruitment was still yet to arrive, “but there are still opportunities for such workers with 30,000 job postings for programmers and software development professionals and nearly 12,000 for IT business analysts, architects and systems designers”.</p>

Trump says negotiators have already discussed ‘dividing up certain assets' and that he will talk to Putin on Tuesday The US president also said that negotiators had already talked about “dividing up certain assets”, including power stations. He said: “I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. Witkoff told CNN that discussions with Putin over several hours last week had been “positive” and “solution-based”. Russia's deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, also on Sunday said that any long-lasting peace treaty on Ukraine must meet Moscow's demands and foreign troops deployed to Ukraine as peacekeepers would be considered by Russia to be combatants.</p>

Thinktank says unauthorised absence is ‘a leading cause' of performance gap between disadvantaged pupils and peers “Without a broader system of support, it is extremely difficult for schools to drive meaningful change in attendance rates.” Di'Iasio said that “for some families, school seems to have become – at least in part – optional”, and said fines for taking unauthorised termtime holidays were failing to halt that trend. “Far from solving the problem, fines often deepen tensions between schools and parents. Getting more pupils attending school regularly is a top priority for the government.”</p>

Researchers said that potato-sized nodules could be producing enough electrical current to split seawater into hydrogen and oxygen, a process known as electrolysis. This cast doubt on the long-established view that life was made possible when organisms started producing oxygen via photosynthesis, which requires sunlight, about 2.7 billion years ago. Environmentalists said the presence of dark oxygen showed just how little is known about life at these extreme depths, and supported their case that deep-sea mining posed unacceptable ecological risks. So, now the scientific community needs to conduct similar experiments etc, and either prove or disprove it." Olivier Rouxel, a geochemistry researcher at Ifremer, the French national institute for ocean science and technology, told AFP there was "absolutely no consensus on these results".</p>

President Donald Trump's administration on Sunday began mass layoffs at Voice of America and other US-funded media, making clear its intent to gut outlets long seen as critical for US influence. Contractors make up much of VOA's workforce and dominate staffing in the non-English language services, although recent figures were not immediately available. Many contractors are not US citizens, meaning they likely depend on their soon-to-disappear jobs for visas to stay in the United States. Trump signed an executive order Friday targeting VOA's parent US Agency for Global Media in his latest sweeping cuts to the federal government. Other US-funded outlets being gutted include Radio Farda, a Persian-language broadcaster blocked by Iran's government, and Alhurra, an Arabic-language network established after the Iraq invasion in the face of highly critical coverage by Qatar-based Al-Jazeera.</p>

From an interior courtyard, near a statue of Pope John Paul II, they sent up chants in Italian of “torna da noi!” — “return to us!” Eyes were peeled on the windows above, but the pope never showed. Our bodies are weak but, even like this, nothing can prevent us from loving, praying, giving ourselves, being for each other, in faith, shining signs of hope.” Instead, it has issued surprisingly detailed reports on his health and described several meetings between the pope and senior clerics, as well as one early in his stay with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. In a medical update Saturday, the Vatican said his condition was improving to the point where doctors have gradually begun reducing ventilation, though Francis remains on high-flow oxygen as he undergoes respiratory and physical therapy. During his health crisis, the Vatican has sought to portray a pope who, even from his hospital bed, has remained at work, taking several significant steps and furthering a slow-moving process of church reform.</p>

National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Sunday held bilateral talks with US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and chaired a conclave of top global intelligence czars focusing on boosting cooperation in confronting various security challenges including terrorism and threats posed by emerging technologies. The deliberations were held behind closed doors and there was no official word on them. In retaliation, New Delhi also expelled Canadian Charge d'Affaires Stewart Wheeler and five other diplomats. It is Ms Gabbard's second foreign trip after assuming charge as the director of national intelligence.

President Donald Trump on Saturday vowed to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks, and warned that Tehran would be held “fully accountable” for their actions. Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, on Sunday told ABC that the strikes “actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.” He didn't identify them or give evidence. If it continues its aggression, we will move to additional escalation options.” The Houthis have targeted U.S. warships and shot down American drones flying over Yemen. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide updated information on operations, said that beginning at about midnight local time in Yemen, the Houthis fired 11 drones and at least one missile over about 12 hours.</p>

NASA said in a statement that it will provide live coverage of the agency's SpaceX Crew-9 return to Earth from the ISS, beginning with Dragon spacecraft hatch closure preparations at 10:45 pm EDT Monday, March 17 (around 8:30 am on March 18 in India). NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will also return on the Dragon capsule. The slated journey will mark the end of an ordeal for Wilmore and Williams that has seen them stuck for nine months after what was meant to have been a days-long roundtrip.</p>

The United States has escalated its strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis, with President Donald Trump vowing on Saturday to use ‘overwhelming lethal force' against the rebels who have attacked international ships in the Red Sea in ‘solidarity' with Gaza.

Multiple US strikes in Yemen's capital Sanaa and other areas have resulted in numerous casualties with the militants also vowing escalation as they face one of the most extensive attacks since the war in Gaza began in October 2023. Here is the conflict in 10 points.

US District Judge James E Boasberg was hearing a suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, which preemptively sued Donald Trump late Friday, saying five Venezuelan men being held at an immigration detention centre in Texas were at “imminent risk of removal” under the Alien Enemies Act. The act, which has been invoked only three times in US history, deports people suspected to be illegal immigrants without an opportunity to be heard before an immigration or federal court judge. On Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt asserted that the administration was not flouting court orders. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele reacted to Boasberg's ruling in a post on social media platform X. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who negotiated the deal with El Salvador, wrote on X, “We sent over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua, which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars.”</p>

Speaking to French media ahead of an online summit that the U.K. hosted on Saturday, Macron said the French-British blueprint doesn't aim to deploy a “mass” of soldiers in Ukraine and instead envisages stationing troop contingents in key locations. Their missions could include providing training and supporting Ukrainian defenses, to demonstrate long-term support for Kyiv, the reports quoted Macron as saying. Le Parisien cited Macron as saying that Moscow's agreement wasn't needed for such deployment. Many more countries were involved this time than the previous meeting on March 2.</p>

But they have since evolved into a “nationwide wave against government malpractice, systemic corruption, and weak institutional oversight,” said Strahinja Subotic, who took part in Saturday's protests and works as a senior researcher at the European Policy Center think tank. But the protests continued, as critics pushed for investigators to add corruption charges. Although the protest movement has been informally led by students, it has grown to include other sectors of society, and “a lot of people are supporting them,” said Engjellushe Morina, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank. “This annoys people because … they can sense that he's not serious about these changes,” she said. Earlier this month, Donald Trump Jr. visited Serbia and interviewed Vucic, who called the protest movement an “imported revolution.”</p>

Rachel Reeves will meet UK regulators on Monday after calling for more action to restrict red tape and spur economic growth. Citing the long battle over a covering for HS2 through ancient woodland, dubbed the bat tunnel, Reeves said wrangling between environmental regulators, councils and government departments needed to stop or time and cost overruns would persist. One proposal will be to make it easier for private sector contractors to obtain environmental permits, with just one agency in charge of the system, and permits being scrapped for low-risk or temporary projects. Reeves said: “Today we are taking further action to free businesses from the shackles of regulation. Since taking office, Reeves has made clear government agencies must support her efforts to expand investment and grow the economy.</p>

The County Kerry town of Dingle boasted one of Ireland's “earliest” St Patrick's Day parades, which kicked off at 6 am local time on Monday, March 17.

Footage from politician Michael Healy-Rae shows Dingle's fife and drum band marching through the town before the sun had risen on Monday morning.

According to national news reports, the tradition stems from restrictions banning gatherings between sunrise and sunset imposed by British authorities in the 1870s.

The parade route included a stop at St Mary's Church for mass, finishing at 7:30 am. Credit: Michael Healy-Rae via Storyful</p>

Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account. "But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years." Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.

The proposal came in a joint court filing on Friday from Musk, Altman, OpenAI, and other named defendants, including Microsoft (MSFT). A judge has ultimate discretion over whether to grant the joint request, though the California federal district court judge overseeing this case, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, is likely to agree on a date that both sides want. The defendants have called Musk's allegations "false" and claimed he has no legal basis for blocking OpenAI's for-profit conversion. Musk named LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Microsoft executive Dee Templeton as defendants, claiming they illegally served as directors of both OpenAI and Microsoft at a time when the two companies were competing in the AI market. While Gonzales Rogers said some of Musk's claims would be fast-tracked for trial, she denied his request for an injunction that would have temporarily blocked the defendants from carrying out plans to turn the artificial intelligence charity into a for-profit business — and from transferring any material assets owned by OpenAI or its subsidiaries, including intellectual property.</p>

Netflix stock has struggled in recent sessions as a broader market sell-off continues to slam high-flying tech names. As a reminder, the company will no longer reveal subscriber data beginning in its 2025 reporting cycle. Management said it decided to raise prices, as its content "has never been better," with more movies and TV shows expected throughout 2025. In 2024, Netflix posted a record-breaking year, which included revenue growth of 16% as operating margins surged 600 basis points to nearly 27% — that's about 300 basis points higher than its guidance at the outset of the year.

Among all UK workers, 10 per cent are currently actively considering leaving work for an extended period, with a further 20 per cent having considered leaving in the last year, data from PwC revealed. As well as the cost to individuals, businesses are understandably concerned about the direct impact on productivity and financial performance,” said Marco Amitrano, senior partner of PwC UK. Despite mass fears around inactivity, employers were reluctant to fix the problem themselves, with 57 per cent revealing they would be worried to recruit someone who had been inactive. Despite stating they were considering more support, the survey found a clear mismatch on what employers were planning to offer, as they highlighted benefits such as company car schemes rather than culture or health support. “If we are serious about reducing economic inactivity and contributing to the government's ambition of economic growth, then we need joined-up action not only helping people back into work, but more importantly stemming the flow of people out of the work,” added Katie Johnston, local and devolved government leader at PwC.</p>

Bitcoin bulls appear ready to make a run at the 200-day SMA, which could pull BTC price toward $92,000 and reinvigorate altcoins. Bitcoin (BTC) has largely stayed above $80,000 since March 11, indicating that the bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy. CryptoQuant contributor ShayanBTC said that investors who purchased Bitcoin between three and six months ago are showing an accumulation pattern. If they succeed, it will signal that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. Dogecoin (DOGE) has been gradually rising toward the 20-day EMA ($0.19), which is an important near-term resistance to watch out for.</p>

ETH price failed to rebound from its recent sell-off, and matters could get worse if the altcoin falls under $1,900. Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), continues to consolidate under $2,000, which some traders view as a psychological level. Ether price slipped below this range on March 10, and the altcoin continues to trade at its lowest value since October 2023. This indicates that ETH's price has a strong support level between $1,900 and $1,843, which can potentially act as the bullish reversal zone. Given the high ETH accumulation and fewer profitable addresses, these factors may act as bullish signals.</p>

Its gains have averaged at around 56% during such rebounds, ̛including rallies that extended beyond the 90%-return mark. If history repeats, Bitcoin could see another parabolic rise by July or August, aligning with previous stochastic RSI bullish crosses that delivered outsized returns. The 50-week EMA wave has served as a strong accumulation zone for traders since October 2023.

Starting with high upfront capital requirements, rigid regulations and protracted settlement processes, these challenges deter all but the most well-funded or persistent buyers. The key advantage of RWA tokenization is that it enables liquidity in an otherwise illiquid market — allowing tokens to be traded 24/7 across a global network — while enhancing transparency, security and efficiency. However, potential adopters still face concerns about regulatory compliance, technological complexity and data authenticity — challenges that go well beyond simply digitizing a property deed. Meanwhile, Mantra Token Service (MTS) includes features like freezing, seizing or burning tokens — vital for aligning onchain activity with real-world legal mandates. The emphasis on simplicity empowers experienced investors and newcomers to participate in real estate tokenization without feeling overwhelmed by technical details or cumbersome red tape.</p>

UK Royal Court of Appeal Judge Christopher Nugee knocked back Howells' application, stating that there was no “real prospect of success” and there was “no other compelling reason” as to why it should be heard, according to a March 13 filing shared with Cointelegraph. Nugee's decision follows an earlier dismissal on Jan. 9 from High Court Judge Andrew Keyser, who similarly said there was “no realistic prospect” of Howells' case succeeding at a full trial.

Howells also appears to be running out of time, as the Docksway landfill is reportedly set to shut down sometime during the UK's 2025-2026 financial year, BBC News reported on Feb. 9.</p>

After spending more than nine months in space, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finally coming home. NASA is targeting a Tuesday evening (March 18) splashdown for the returning astronauts, if weather conditions remain favorable. Wilmore and Williams arrived at the ISS in June as part of Boeing's first Starliner Crew Test Flight. But a number of issues with Boeing's spacecraft — including five helium leaks and five failures of its reaction control system (RCS) thrusters — led to the mission being abandoned and the duo's time in space extended from eight days to nearly 300. To mitigate them, the astronauts have been doing two hours of resistance and endurance training every day.</p>

Just like the mountains, lakes on Earth can be ancient, or more than 1 million years old. Rift lakes form when two continental plates start moving away from each other, creating a chasm. "As a result, that site never fills in," Edlund said, which is why rift lakes can last so long. These organisms pull dissolved silica from the water and turn it into biologically produced glass, which encases them. "When we look at the diatoms in Lake Baikal, they just blow your mind," Edlund said.</p>

The Cincinnati Bengals are one of only two teams in the NFL that don't have a general manager, but it seems like they might have one now: Joe Burrow. As for Higgins, he landed a four-year, $115 million deal that makes him highest paid No. Fair or not, the Bengals have a reputation around the NFL for being cheap and that was fully on display last year when both Higgins and Chase were each trying to negotiate a new deal. Two months later, the star QB showed up to Super Bowl week in New Orleans and while he was there, he sent a very clear message to the Bengals' front office: Get my guys under contract. When you're paying your starting quarterback and his two favorite receivers an average of $124 million per year, that means you have to save money in other spots on the roster and you do that by drafting smart and finding low-cost free agents who can have an instant impact.</p>

The Cincinnati Bengals may be able to have their cake and eat it, too. Less than 24 hours after word came down the franchise  is inking historic extensions with receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, it now appears Cincinnati may also be keeping another familiar face in town. If the Bengals do end up finding a way to keep Hendrickson aboard, it would be an almost unfathomable development. Similar to Chase and Higgins, however, it'll likely cost a pretty penny. Hendrickson, 30, is coming off a tremendous season where he led the NFL with 17.5 sacks.</p>

But, again, let's go back to West Virginia: Selection committee chair Bubba Cunningham noted Tucker DeVries' injury as something that was taken into account. That would make sense if DeVries' injury was a recent thing, and the team looked very different without him. The Wildcats have legitimate NIL resources and, obviously, a tremendous track record of success, just not under Neptune.</p>

That distinction was held shortly by Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett, who recently signed a four-year, $160 million extension. Teammates since 2021, Chase and Higgins have become arguably the NFL's top receiving duo over that span. Along with Chase and Higgins, the Bengals also recently granted one of Burrow's other wishes by re-signing tight end Mike Gesicki to a three-year, $25.5 million deal. The NFL's leader with 17.5 sacks last season, Hendrickson wants to remain in Cincinnati, but he is also looking for a significant pay raise. It'll be interesting to see if the Bengals can work similar magic with Hendrickson as they did for Chase and Higgins.</p>

Since Crosby signed an extension earlier this month that put him at a $35.5 million average annual salary, two players have since surpassed that mark over the next two weeks. With Chase joining Garrett in the $40 million non-quarterback club, Chase's deal will certainly impact other non-quarterbacks whose agents are popping bottles while negotiating extensions for their superstar clients. Wide receivers still dominate the highest-paid non-quarterbacks list based on average per year salary, as eight of them are in the top-12 with Hill, Metcalf and Aiyuk tied for 10th. He broke Jefferson's mark set last offseason, but remains in third among non-quarterbacks behind Garrett and Bosa. These two charts hammer home why Garrett's deal set sthe barometer for Watt, Parsons, Hendrickson, and other pass rushers seeking extensions.</p>

Some speculation has been making the rounds that North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham, who also serves as selection committee chair, had a role in making sure his team received a bid. Decisions like this invite such speculation, but the committee has very strict rules about members not being allowed to discuss or vote on their own team or teams in their conference. That rule is strictly enforced, so it's highly unlikely Cunningham swayed any decision-making in this case. That is especially true of the predictive metrics, which primarily try to predict scoring margins. Also, there are teams in the bracket seeded nowhere near their predicative metric rankings.</p>

Since 2011, a total of 13 teams seeded seventh or worse have crashed the season's final weekend, including 11th-seeded NC State last year. Sure, that was under John Calipari, but new head coach Mark Pope has won a grand total of zero games in the Big Dance and has twice been beaten in the first round as a top six seed. That's fairly remarkable considering we're talking about just two 11 or 12 seeds every single year having the opportunity to make this happen. That has the potential to be a bit longer than those interested schools would like. That didn't happen, and now the Zags are set to face Georgia in an 8/9 contest on Thursday.</p>

Dallas Mavericks fans are still in mourning (well, sports mourning, anyway) over the already infamous trade that sent franchise cornerstone Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers for a package centered around Anthony Davis. Things went downhill for Dallas immediately after the deal, as Davis was injured in his first game and has yet to return, while star guard Kyrie Irving was lost for the season due to a torn ACL in early March. As a result, the Mavericks have absolutely cratered, going 1-6 since Irving's injury and falling from No. "We get paid a lot of money just to play basketball, so for us, we have little things like that that may be distracting and what not -- it shouldn't affect us.

Rep.

"President Trump and Elon Musk blew up the continuing resolution last December that would have extended these telehealth authorities by two years," Khanna told us via email. Permanently extending telehealth for medical care under Medicare could cost taxpayers about $25 billion over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. Congress made Medicare coverage of behavioral health services delivered remotelypermanent in December 2020, but left other telehealth benefits hanging on by a string. "Now, once again, we've got another deadline where, if Congress doesn't act, our flexibilities go away," said Kyle Zebley, senior vice president of public policy for the American Telemedicine Association.</p>

Increasing research highlights postbiotics' beneficial mechanisms, primarily their ability to modulate protective actions against pathogens, fortify epithelial barriers, and regulate immune responses. As scientific understanding deepens, postbiotics stand poised to complement probiotics significantly, marking a transformative shift towards comprehensive, preventive healthcare strategies and innovative therapeutic applications.1 For example, poultry-fed diets enriched with postbiotics demonstrate increased body weight gain, improved feed conversion rates, and healthier gut morphology compared to control groups.2,3 They promote the growth of beneficial gut microbiota, directly compete with pathogenic bacteria for adhesion sites, and enhance mucosal defense mechanisms through antimicrobial peptides. They offer benefits like modulating immune responses, enhancing gut barrier integrity, and exerting anti-inflammatory effects without the risks associated with administering live microorganisms, especially in immunocompromised individuals.5</p>

Nivola acknowledged that Lochlan “gets really f—ed up and does something terrible” as a result. My character's big turning point is that moment at the end of episode 5,” he continued. But I think as is the case with The White Lotus, it's like these crazy actions and sort of heightened reality coming from really real emotions that are actually really relatable to your everyday guy.” Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</p>

For Schulz, he “loves” having conversations with people who share different views than him because his opinions “get sharper.” As they continued to discuss his controversial humor, Shepard said the first time he became “scared” for Schulz was during an alleged feud with Kendrick Lamar.
