The White House insists a peace deal in the Ukraine war is close - after Donald Trump and the Kremlin announce he will speak to Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Follow the latest here.

Vladimir Putin could ask for more concessions from Ukraine before he signs a ceasefire agreement, Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia, tells Sky News.

So far Donald Trump has given Russia "all concessions", including saying Ukraine needs to give up territory, can't become a NATO member and there will be no US peacekeepers.

In return "it's been all sticks" for Ukraine, he says, including cutting off military assistance and intelligence.

"Now the ball's in Putin's court and I wouldn't be surprised if he signed it because he's gotten so much in return already," he says.

As ambassador to Russia McFaul says he negotiated with the Putin administration and "I can tell you that you don't just give them everything in the beginning and then hope for goodwill back.

"It doesn't work that way with these guys. They pocket your concessions and ask for more."

He adds: "I worry Putin has hinted that now he's pocketed the earlier concessions, he wants more things."

He says Trump is "not interested in the deals of any long-term negotiation" and just wants to get a temporary ceasefire so he can declare victory.

On the other hand, from the Ukrainian perspective, "a ceasefire is just a baby step towards what they want to be a more long-term security settlement".

Asked what will happen in the next few weeks, McFaul says he thinks "Putin is going to take one more run at some more demands."

"He's going to test the waters for that, and then he'll probably sign an agreement. But it'll be a very temporary agreement, just 30 days. I hope it launches a peace settlement because the Ukrainian people deserve peace. But I'm not optimistic about the long-term peace and stability under these current terms."

One detail White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed in the news conference earlier was that Donald Trump will discuss a power plant on the border of Ukraine and Russia with Vladimir Putin tomorrow.

Leavitt did not give any details about which power plant she was referring to, but her comments may have been a reference to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the largest nuclear plant in Europe.

Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of risking an accident at the plant with their actions.

For context: The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has six units with a one gigawatt capacity each.

It was occupied by Russian troops in early March 2022 and shut down in September that year due to battles near the plant.

Ukraine's state-owned firm Energoatom has said it does not know the state of the equipment and warned the Russian occupation could result in a serious disaster.

It said because of that it would take up to a year to restart operations at the plant.

Ukraine and Russia "have never been closer to peace" and "we are on the 10th-yard line" according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, but our US correspondent James Matthews says, to extend the American football analogy, "the question is who's carrying the ball?"

"There is a strong argument to say that's Vladimir Putin right now," he adds.

"She was asked about this business of Donald Trump talking about detail, things to be negotiated," he says.

"She was asked: 'Has Donald Trump been speaking to the Ukrainians about that fine detail?'

"She seemed to indicate there had been discussions about that. That would be a surprise I think. The Ukrainians want to get to a starting point, which is a ceasefire, and thereafter get into detailed negotiations.

"So we'll see how that comes out in the wash tomorrow."

We've been listening to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt's news conference, where she was asked about ceasefire negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.

She says "we are on the 10th-yard line of peace and we've never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment".

"The president is determined to get one done," she adds.

Asked if Donald Trump would consider putting sanctions on Russia if his phone call with Vladimir Putin doesn't go well tomorrow, Leavitt replies: "It's something the president has floated, and certainly he's willing to do if necessary."

Leavitt also sidesteps a question on whether Volodymyr Zelenskyy has given Trump authority to divide up Ukrainian assets with Putin.

She says it has been part of the discussion between the US president and his Ukrainian counterpart, but adds further details will come after Trump's call with Putin tomorrow.

She also declines to answer a question on whether Trump and Putin will discuss Zelenskyy's future.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is holding a news conference ahead of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin's phone call tomorrow.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy was asked further questions about the war in Ukraine by the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, after he delivered a statement to the House of Commons on the G7 meeting in Canada last week.

He says the pause in US intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine "has not had a material effect" because it was only for a short period.

Discussing the ceasefire proposal, Lammy says the UK is prepared to consider putting British troops on the ground, "but there must be a US backstop".

"At stake is not only the future of Ukraine but the collective security of our continent and therefore Britain's direct national interest," he says.

The foreign secretary also says Russia must "pay for the damage it is causing" in Ukraine, and there will be a discussion on "moving from freezing to seizing" Russian assets.

Here's a look at what Foreign Secretary David Lammy said about the Ukraine war during his statement to the House of Commons about last week's G7 meeting in Canada.

Lammy says Vladimir Putin must prove he is serious about peace by agreeing a "full and unconditional ceasefire now".

He says the G7 countries are "united" in supporting Ukraine and its pursuit of peace.

He says: "Now it is Putin who stands in the spotlight, Putin who must answer, Putin who must choose - are you serious, Mr Putin about peace?

"Will you stop the fighting or will you drag your feet and play games, pay lip service to the ceasefire whilst still pummelling Ukraine? My warning to Mr Putin is this: if you are serious, prove it with a full and unconditional ceasefire now.

"And if Putin does not deliver, and I must tell the House that I currently see no sign yet that he is, the G7 meeting helped us ready the tools to get Russia to negotiate seriously.

"We're not waiting for the Kremlin. If they reject a ceasefire, we have more cards that we can play."

Foreign Secretary David Lammy has just given a statement in the House of Commons on last week's G7 meeting in Canada.

You can watch his speech here:

Three children have been injured by Russian shelling in the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, the head of the Donetsk regional administration has said.

Vadym Filashkin said the injured included two girls aged eight and 15 and one boy aged 12.

All three are receiving medical care, he added.

He said the children had "already been evacuated to a safer region, but their parents made a crazy decision to return to Pokrovsk".

He added: "Adults forcing their children to sit under fire in frontline cities are provoking outrage.

"If you don't take care of yourself, then at least take care of the children! Don't wait for a shell or bomb to arrive at your house! Evacuate!"

Earlier, military analyst Michael Clarke explained how Russia could divert troops to the battle for Pokrovsk after gaining the upper hand in the battle for Kursk (see our 13.50 post).

These pictures show Ukrainian servicemen firing a 120mm mortar towards Russian troops on the frontline near the city of Chasiv Yar in eastern Ukraine.

The passports of multiple employees of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek have been confiscated, preventing them from travelling outside the country, according to a new report. The government has reportedly tightened regulations on the company to prevent sensitive information from being leaked and key employees from deserting it.

DeepSeek's parent company, High-Flyer, a hedge fund, is holding onto the passports of key employees - especially those in research and development - to ensure they cannot leave the country without approval, The Information reported.

The report further claimed that the Chinese government now plays a direct role in deciding who can invest in DeepSeek, which gained global attention in January with the launch and meteoric rise of its open-source "reasoning" model, R1.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's administration has even labelled DeepSeek a "national treasure".

DeepSeek's AI technology has faced scrutiny for following China's censorship rules. Earlier, The Guardian reported that DeepSeek's chatbot avoids discussing sensitive political topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre, the Hong Kong Umbrella Revolution, and other government-sensitive issues.

The restrictions come amid heightened AI competition between China and the US. Reports suggest that Beijing recently advised AI researchers and business leaders to avoid travelling to the US due to concerns about trade secret leaks.

Kylie Robison, a senior AI reporter at The Verge, cited three unnamed sources who claimed the purpose of these travel bans was to prevent the disclosure of confidential data, including trade or even state secrets.

Founded in May 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, DeepSeek quickly became a significant player in the AI industry. The company first entered the AI space with DeepSeek Coder in November 2023, followed by DeepSeek LLM and DeepSeek V-2 in May 2024. Its most recent models, R1 and V-3, have drawn global attention for their impressive capabilities at a surprisingly low cost.

DeepSeek's AI model, DeepSeek-V3, reportedly costed under $6 million (Rs 51 crore) to develop - significantly less than what US tech giants like Microsoft and OpenAI spend. According to its creators, DeepSeek-V3 "tops the leaderboard among open-source models" and rivals leading closed-source AI models in math, coding, and natural language reasoning.

India's finance ministry recently warned employees against using AI tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek on government devices, citing risks to official data privacy. The US has also imposed export bans on high-end Nvidia A100 chips, limiting DeepSeek's access to critical hardware. The European Union is also considering tighter regulations on foreign AI applications to safeguard national security and user data.

Russia appears to be on the cusp of outperforming Ukraine in the use of drones on the battlefield.A recent article by BBC sheds light on the Ukrainian retreat from the battle of Kursk. Ukraine has held this pocket of Russian territory since August 2024. It was one of the few bright spots of last year as Ukraine was hard-pressed by Russia, and its other offensives stalled. Now Moscow has forced Ukrainians out of the Kursk area, who told BBC that Russian drones played a major role.  The BBC article matters because it illustrates a drone learning curve that Russia has pursued since the war began. Russia acquired Iranian Shahed kamikaze drones early in the war in 2022 and used them to target Ukraine. These one-way attack drones were not a game changer.However, Russia's use of them showed how Iranian-backed groups would use the same drones against Israel after the Hamas attack on October 7. That illustrates how what Russia is doing in Kursk may have ramifications for the Middle East. Reports at Conflict Armament Research revealed this month that the Houthis are working with hydrogen fuel cells to power drones.

The report says Kyiv sent around 12,000 soldiers, some of its best trained, into the fight. Russia sent tens of thousands to cordon off the Ukrainian gains and then attempted to roll back the Ukrainians. The report says that, in the end, Kyiv was relying on one road to supply its salient forces.This is a classic challenge in military terms, and it appears that this road now resembles the Iraqi army's retreat from Kuwait. Basically, Ukrainians have been fleeing at night and leaving behind equipment and vehicles. “Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to ‘take fire control of the main logistics routes.'” The report said. “They included drones linked to operators by fiber-optic wires – which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.”In another part of the report, in which the BBC spoke to Ukrainian soldiers who have been able to get out of the Kursk front via retreating, it appears that Russian FPV drones, or those using a first-person viewer (FPV) flight mode, have been essential.

BRUSSELS (AP) — International donors gathered on Monday in a show of support for Syria, hoping to encourage the new leaders of the conflict-ravaged country toward a peaceful political transition following the ouster of President Bashar Assad in December.

Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani attended the conference — the ninth of its kind — in a first for a top official from Damascus.

But the United States, one of Syria's top donors, wasn't expected to offer assistance as the Trump administration is reviewing all foreign aid. It contributed almost $1.2 billion to Syria and the region last year.

Ministers and representatives from Western partners, Syria's regional neighbors, other Arab countries and U.N. agencies also attended the one-day meeting in Brussels, organized in haste by the European Union amid change sweeping the country.

Opening the meeting, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU was increasing its pledge to Syrians in the country and the region to almost 2.5 billion euros ($2.7 billion) for 2025 and 2026.

“We call on all of you who are here today to do the same, if possible, because at this critical time, the people of Syria need us more than ever,” von der Leyen said.

Syria's new leaders are trying to consolidate control over territory that was divided into de facto mini-states during nearly 14 years of civil war, and to rebuild the economy and infrastructure. The United Nations has estimated that it would cost at least $250 billion to rebuild Syria, while experts say that could reach at least $400 billion.




At the same time, Western governments are cutting back on aid spending, in part to use in defense budgets.

“We will give more, but we cannot fill the gap left by the U.S.,” EU Crisis Management Commissioner Hadja Lahbib told reporters. “We will need to share the burden.”

Security concerns are also making donors hesitate. Last week, an ambush on a Syrian security patrol by gunmen loyal to Assad triggered clashes. Some factions allied with the new government launched sectarian revenge attacks — primarily targeting Assad's Alawite minority sect — that monitoring groups say killed hundreds of civilians over several days.

The EU said that it will only support “a peaceful and inclusive transition, away from malign foreign interference, which guarantees the rights of all Syrians without distinction of any kind.”

The 27-nation bloc has begun to ease energy, transport and financial sector sanctions to encourage the new authorities, but many other Western sanctions remain in place. The EU can reintroduce sanctions if things don't go to the liking of Western backers.

Syria's foreign minister said that lifting the measures is no longer just a government demand but “a humanitarian and moral necessity.”

“We cannot talk about economic recovery and humanitarian development in Syria while restrictions continue to prevent even the arrival of medical equipment and spare parts to repair damaged hospitals and essential service facilities,” he said.

Syria's economy, infrastructure and institutions are in tatters. As a failed state, it could become another haven for extremists.

Amy Pope, director-general of the International Organization for Migration, urged donors to seize this opportunity to encourage the interim government to move in the right direction.

“It's critical that countries take advantage of the moment we're in,” Pope told The Associated Press.

“Of course, we all want to see an inclusive Syria,” she said. “We want to make sure there's accountability for human rights violations. But the answer is to engage more, not to engage less.”

Syrians have only a few hours of electricity each day. Water supplies are unreliable and often unsafe. Unemployment runs to 80% or 90%. Destruction is widespread.

Many government employees and experts needed to rebuild fled after the 2011 Arab Spring democracy movement collapsed into conflict and authoritarian rule under Assad.

The U.N. refugee agency said that last year around 7 million people were displaced in Syria. More than 4.7 million refugees are registered in neighboring countries, most in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.

The German government said that it would pledge around 300 million euros ($326 million) to help deal with the fallout from Syria's civil war. More than half will be used to help people in Syria, with other funding supporting Syrians and communities elsewhere.

Monday's conference was also focused on meeting Syria's economic needs. Infrastructure, health and education must be scaled up. Jobs and cash for work programs are needed so that Syrians can start to make a living.

(TNND) — President Donald Trump told "Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson" that failing to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine would be "bad news for this world."

"Because so many people are dying," Trump told Attkisson. "But I think ... he's going to agree. I really do. I think I know him pretty well, and I think he's going to agree."



Russian foreign policy expert Mark N. Katz said Trump sees a continuation of the war as bad for not just Ukraine, but also Russia and the rest of Europe.

“I don't think he was making a comment on how the U.S. would react,” said Katz, a professor emeritus of government and politics at George Mason University.

Trump views the war as counterproductive, Katz said.

Trump thinks ending the war would allow Russia to normalize relations and see sanctions lifted, Katz said.

Ending the war would save lives.

And it could even open the door for U.S. investments in Russia, Katz said.

“From Trump's deal-making viewpoint, it just makes sense,” he said.

Though, he noted, Trump can't bind American corporations to invest in Russia or trade with Russia. And a lot of them have had bad experiences in Russia in the past.

Trump plans to speak with Putin on Tuesday as he pushes to end the war in Ukraine.

Ukraine has agreed to an American-proposed 30-day ceasefire with Russia.

Now, the ball is in Putin's court.



The ceasefire breakthrough arrived in talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, last week in Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. also agreed to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.

The turnaround came after a tense White House meeting at the end of last month between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump told Attkisson that he wants to end the war to save lives and money, telling her the U.S. has spent “massive amounts of money” on helping Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February 2022.

Trump told Attkisson that the U.S. has spent $350 billion on Ukraine, which is a higher dollar amount than what's been reported by other sources, including an official U.S. government website.

The Council on Foreign Relations says the U.S. has pledged $175 billion to support Ukraine via five bills passed by Congress, most recently in April 2024.



And the Council on Foreign Relations noted that a lot of the Ukraine funds passed by Congress are being spent in the U.S., paying for American factories and workers to produce weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or used to replenish American arsenals.

The U.S. is Ukraine's largest donor, but over a dozen European countries have given Ukraine a bigger percentage of their economic output as support against Russia.

Attkisson also asked Trump about his campaign pledge to end the war in 24 hours if elected.

“Well, I was being a little bit sarcastic when I said that. ... What I really mean is I'd like to get it settled,” Trump told her.

Katz said Trump likely knew that was a campaign promise he couldn't keep.

“I'm pretty sure that he knew during the campaign that he wasn't going to end it within 24 hours,” Katz said. “I think what he was trying to indicate during the campaign (was) that he would try to end it quickly.”

It won't be easy to get Putin to agree to a ceasefire, Katz said.

And it probably won't happen quickly.

“Putin has indicated that he doesn't want just a ceasefire,” Katz said. “He wants to address the root causes, as he sees them. So, he wants a ceasefire plus concessions from Ukraine and the West.”



Putin won't want the West to keep arming the Ukrainians, Katz said.

The French and British are talking about sending troops to Ukraine to provide security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire, but Katz said both nations will be wary of sending troops without American support.

Ukraine and the West might demand North Korean troops leave Russia in exchange, Katz said.

The North Koreans have been helping Russia drive back Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region, and that mission has mostly been accomplished. So, it's possible Putin would be OK with losing North Korean support on the battlefield.

Putin likely wants to not only keep what he's gained but add the rest of the land in partially occupied Ukrainian provinces, according to Katz.

Russia controls nearly 44,000 square miles of Ukraine, or close to a fifth of Ukrainian territory including Crimea and parts of Donbas that Russia had seized before its 2022 invasion.

Russia has taken over another 27,000 square miles of Ukraine since its invasion three years ago.



And Putin wants a guarantee that NATO won't admit Ukraine, which Katz said should be viewed as an untenable demand.

NATO was created in 1949 by the U.S., Canada, and several Western European nations to provide collective security against the Soviet Union.

NATO membership is between NATO and candidate countries, Katz said.

Katz said Putin doesn't want to burn his bridges with Trump, so he's likely to entertain ceasefire talks.

But Katz doesn't see Putin making any commitments quickly.

If Putin doesn't eventually agree to a ceasefire, then Trump will have to decide if he wants to increase the pressure on Russia via more sanctions or with more support for Ukraine.

Katz said more sanctions aren't likely to change Russia's behavior.

And he said Trump probably doesn't want to increase support for Ukraine.

Katz said Putin might try to jam Trump into that tough decision.

“Putin might see it as a way to call Trump's bluff,” Katz said.

Or, Katz said, Putin might try and put Ukraine in a hard position between agreeing to a Russia-favoring deal or risk further damaging its relations with Trump.

Katz said that's a classic Russian “divide your opponents from each other strategy.”

People suspected of involvement in 2024 Vilnius attack also accused of links to crimes in Poland

Lithuanian prosecutors have blamed the Russian military intelligence service for being behind an arson attack on an Ikea store in Vilnius last year, calling it “an act of terrorism”.

Lithuania, a Nato member, has been a staunch ally of Ukraine since Moscow invaded in February 2022, and has frequently warned of Russian sabotage attempts.

On Monday, the Lithuanian prosecutor general's office attributed the arson attack in Vilnius in May 2024 to Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU.

There were no casualties, but the prosecutor Arturas Urbelis told reporters: “We regard this act as an act of terrorism with serious consequences.”

Two Ukrainian citizens were suspects in the Ikea arson case, with one being detained in Lithuania and the other in Poland, he added.

“It has been established that through a series of intermediaries … the organisers of these crimes are in Russia and this is connected to military intelligence and security forces,” Urbelis said.

The prosecutor's office said the person detained in Lithuania was suspected of having entered Poland in spring 2024.

“During a secret meeting in Warsaw, he and another person agreed to set fire to and blow up shopping centres in Lithuania and Latvia for a reward of €10,000 (nearly $11,000),” the office said in a statement.

“More than one supermarket has been set on fire, and not just supermarkets,” Urbelis said when asked about whether the arson was linked to similar cases in neighbouring Poland.

“It is obvious that the persons we have identified, the perpetrators and the intermediaries, are also linked to the criminal acts committed in Poland,” he added.

Poland was currently investigating about 30 alleged acts of preparation or commission of sabotage, the authorities said.

The Polish prosecutor Przemyslaw Nowak said: “After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we have indeed observed an increase in the activity of foreign services in Poland, including primarily the services of Russia.”

“Unfortunately, we have evidence that in Poland, and not only in Poland, there are several organised groups that plan and carry out acts of sabotage,” he added.

Commenting on Lithuania's findings, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said it was “exceptionally perfidious” for Russia to hire Ukrainians as perpetrators of sabotage acts.

“Dear allies, the investigation of the Lithuanian prosecutor's office has confirmed our suspicions that responsible for setting fires to shopping centres in Vilnius and Warsaw are the Russian secret services,” he said on X.

“Good to know before negotiations. Such is the nature of this state,” he added, referring to potential talks on war-torn Ukraine's fate.

Trump administration used Alien Enemies Act to deport about 250 alleged gang members to El Salvador

The White House has denied allegations that it engaged in a “a blatant violation” of a judge's order by deporting about 250 Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador on Saturday, with the US border czar appearing to contradict the denial on Monday by declaring: “I don't care what the judges think.”

The US district judge James E Boasberg has scheduled a hearing for Monday afternoon to demand an explanation about why his Saturday order order temporarily blocking the deportation flights had apparently been ignored.

The Trump administration had ordered at least some of the deportations using the Alien Enemies Act, a law from 1798 that is meant to be used during wartime. The president quietly invoked the law on Friday and progressive groups almost immediately sued to stop it.

On Saturday, during a court hearing over the case, Boasberg added a verbal order that any flights that had already departed with Venezuelan immigrants using the Alien Enemies Act turn around and return to the US.

“This is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately,” he told the justice department, according to the Washington Post.

At that point (about 6.51pm ET, according to Axios), both flights were off the Yucatán peninsula, according to flight paths posted on X.

Later on Saturday night, however, El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, confirmed that the planes had landed in his country and the alleged gang members were in custody, posting on social media, “Oopsie … too late” above a news article about the judge's order to turn the planes around.

White House officials insisted that the migrants were no longer in US territory when the judge issued his order, claiming that it therefore did not apply.

The administration “did not ‘refuse to comply' with a court order”, said the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, in a statement on Monday.

She also argued, however, that the order itself did not need to be followed in the first place.

“The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA aliens had already been removed from US territory,” Leavitt said. “The written order and the administration's actions do not conflict.

“As the supreme court has repeatedly made clear – federal courts generally have no jurisdiction over the president's conduct of foreign affairs, his authorities under the Alien Enemies Act, and his core Article II powers to remove foreign alien terrorists from US soil and repel a declared invasion.

“A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrying foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from US soil.”

Other Trump administration officials, who have not been named, echoed similar statements to Axios about the ruling coming too late, claiming that the administration did not defy the judge as the planes were “already outside of US airspace” and therefore arguing that the order was “not applicable”.

ABC News also reported that the administration cited “operational” and “national security” reasons that the planes needed to land, and that the two planes took off during the hearing on Saturday.

When asked by a reporter on Sunday whether the administration violated the judge's orders, Donald Trump said: “I don't know, you have to speak to the lawyers about that.” He added: “I can tell you this, these were bad people.”

Reuters reported that the Trump administration stated in a court filing on Sunday that “some” of the Venezuelans had already been removed from the US before the judge's order, but did not provide any further details.

The New York Times noted that the filing implied that the government had other legal grounds for the deportations of the Venezuelans, other than the use of the Alien Enemies Act that was blocked by the judge.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, which sued to stop the use of the act, added in a court filing on Monday that they believe that the government violated the court order , calling the administration's actions a “blatant violation of the court's order”.

The rights groups asked the judge to compel the administration to clarify whether any flights departed after the judge's orders, and to provide more information on the flight timings.

On Monday morning, Boasberg scheduled a 4pm hearing for the Trump administration to explain if they defied his order.

Later on Monday morning, Tom Homan, Trump's “border czar”, told reporters: “By the time the order came, the plane was already over international waters, with a plane full of terrorists and significant public safety threats.”

He added: “To turn the plane around over international waters” and “come back with terrorists back to the United States, that's not what this president promised the American people”.

He followed up the remarks in an appearance on Fox and Friends, where according to the Hill he said: “I don't care what the judges think. I don't care.”

He repeated his claim that the flight was “already in international waters” but also questioned why the judge would want “terrorists returned to the United States”: “Look, President Trump, by proclamation, invoked the authorities of the Alien Enemies Act, which he has a right to do, and it's a gamechanger.”

The Georgetown law professor Steve Vladeck criticised the administration's argument that it was too late to act once the planes had left the US. He argued on social media that “a federal court's jurisdiction does not stop at the water's edge” but rather, “the question is whether the defendants are subject to the court order, not where the conduct being challenged takes place”.

Vladeck also told the Associated Press that although the judge's verbal directive to turn around the planes was not technically part of his final written order, nevertheless the Trump administration clearly violated the “spirit” of it.

Peter Markowitz, a Cardozo Law School professor and immigration enforcement expert, told Reuters that he believed the Trump administration's actions “most certainly violate” the court's order.

In a statement on Monday, the Democratic senators Alex Padilla, Cory Booker, Dick Durbin and Peter Welch condemned Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.

“Let's be clear: we are not at war, and immigrants are not invading our country,” they said. “Furthermore, courts determine whether people have broken the law – not a president acting alone, and not immigration agents picking and choosing who gets imprisoned or deported.”

The deportations may not be the only instance of the White House directly violating a court order, after the administration reportedly deported Dr Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist and Brown University professor, despite a court order temporarily blocking her expulsion.

Citing her attorney and court documents, the New York Times reported that the 34-year-old Lebanese citizen – who had a valid US visa – was detained on Thursday upon returning to the US after visiting family in Lebanon. A federal judge had reportedly ordered the government to provide the court with 48 hours' notice before deporting Alawieh, but she was reportedly put on a flight to Paris anyway. A hearing in her case is set for Monday.

Christian organizations helped create Pepfar, credited with preventing 25m early deaths, particularly in Africa

Christian evangelical organizations instrumental in creating the US program that has saved millions of lives from HIV/Aids are pressing the Trump administration to rescue the scheme from crushing cuts to foreign assistance.

The state department has said that the two-decade-old President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), which is estimated to have prevented 25m early deaths, is exempt from the cancellation of most US overseas aid. But the program is heavily reliant on logistical support from the US Agency for International Development (USAid), which has seen most of its projects killed off.

Evangelical groups, many of which backed Trump's election because of abortion policy, say delivery of anti-retroviral medicines (ARVs) funded by the US has all but ground to a halt in some countries, particularly in Africa. They warn that could lead to a resurgence of Aids in parts of the world where it has been brought under control, costing millions of lives.

But other evangelical organizations and churches have been accused of staying silent in defense of what has been described as one of the most successful foreign aid programs in US history for political reasons because so many of their members support Trump.

Emily Chambers Sharpe, health director at World Relief, the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, said that healthcare centers and hospitals in different parts of Africa report that “the supply chain for HIV as a whole has been very badly damaged” by the aid cuts.

“When Pepfar was up for reauthorization we, as World Relief, have supported it every time. We see it as really overarchingly a pro-life program in that it promotes the life-saving need for HIV treatment, which many of us in the field have called The Lazarus Effect,” she said.

“When you get someone on antiretroviral therapy, you see them literally be able to come back to life. And now we know if you're on antiretroviral therapy, you can even prevent the spread of the virus to others so it's not just life-saving for you, it can be life-saving for loads of other people.”

Chambers Sharpe criticised what she called a “lack of transparency” within the state department about cuts to USAid and its impact on Pepfar.

Galen Carey, vice-president of government relations at the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE), which has backed some of Trump's policies while also criticizing its harsh treatment of refugees as unChristian, called on the administration to save Pepfar before it is too late.

“We're encouraging the administration to get the program back up to full speed as soon as possible,” he said.

Carey said “there's quite a bit of concern in Congress because Pepfar has been a very popular bipartisan program” but he added that it has been caught up in the broader assault on foreign aid.

About 20 million people are reliant on medicines supplied by Pepfar mostly in Africa and parts of Asia. Some countries, such as Nigeria, depend on Pepfar for almost all their HIV funding. Others are less reliant but Pepfar still provides crucial health infrastructure because its clinics frequently employ medical staff who treat other conditions as part of the broader programme of combatting Aids.

Matthew Loftus, a doctor and evangelical Christian working at a mission hospital in Kenya, said the damage was already being done on the ground. He said that Pepfar “is being dismantled” and that “many people will die” as a result.

“In some places they're not getting the drugs or they're being asked to pay cash for the drugs. Other places are completely closed and so patients are scrambling to find medications or they're going without,” he said.

“There are going to be consequences. Once you stop taking ARVs, within days the virus can come back online and then start developing resistance. I'm really scared that there are going to be a bunch of people who haven't been taking their drugs and then, when we try to start them back, we're going to find that they're resistant. They could turn everything back on tomorrow and I think there would be permanent damage. Once you fire people and close clinics, rebuilding trust is difficult, getting people to come back is difficult.”

Evangelical Christian groups were instrumental in persuading President George W Bush to launch Pepfar in 2004. Carey said churches saw it not only as a pro-life position but an opportunity to promote their values.

“When I first went to Africa in 1997, an HIV-positive diagnosis was basically a death sentence. It was devastating. Many pastors spent much of their time conducting funerals. Driving along main roads in Kenya you would see shop after shop selling coffins,” he said.

“Over time, it really turned around in a dramatic way. The stories that came out of caring for orphans and helping local churches and promoting Christian understanding of sexual morality and faithfulness in marriage was an important piece of the puzzle since a lot of the transmission was through sexual contact. It fitted in with our broader concerns, both pro-life and pro-family.”

A change of heart by the acerbic segregationist senator, Jesse Helms, brought on a lot of conservative support by shifting the US narrative around Aids away from sexual morality.

In 2003, the rock star Bono told Helms that Aids had created 10 million orphans in Africa and that the lives of newborn babies could be saved by a single dose of a medicine that limited the transmission of HIV from mother to child. Helms was persuaded that Aids relief was a pro-life position and opened the door to congressional support for Pepfar.

Loftus has seen the impact of the programme on the ground in Kenya.

“Most HIV-positive patients I see are patients whose viral load is completely suppressed and they are coming to the hospital for a different problem. When I do see someone who dies of HIV-related illness, it's just another tragedy because now it's completely preventable,” he said.

“I hear stories from older missionaries. They talk about wards full of people with Aids, dying all the time. That's part of the fear looking ahead. If these programmes don't survive, what are we going to go back to?”

The call to save Pepfar has been joined by a range of religious groups, including the National Latino Evangelical Coalition. But Loftus said that, as an evangelical, he was concerned that many churches are not speaking up in support of the initiative, even though they have in the past, because it would mean criticising Trump.

“People I talk to are aggrieved about this. It is challenging the way that churches follow political trends rather than the other way around,” he said.

“Some churches are not as eager to put their necks out and advocate for something that seems to be opposed by some of the people in power. I think churches and Christians who are politically active are not aware of what's at stake, and many of them are probably consuming news in an environment that isn't even bringing it up as an issue. But I think also that there is this conflict now between our convictions versus who's in charge and who do we want to please?”

At each stop on 1,000-mile trip, discombobulated Europeans are grappling with new and unsettling realities as the US reforges its alliances

While Donald Trump talks of the “big beautiful ocean” separating the US from the war in Ukraine, 1,000 miles of rail track links London St Pancras to the city of Lviv in western Ukraine.

The 19-hour trip takes in Brussels, the German economic powerhouse of Frankfurt, and Vienna, the Austrian capital, before the train rattles into Kraków in south-east Poland and Przemyśl, the Polish border town where the slimmer railway gauges of western Europe meet the wider tracks of Ukraine and Russia to the east.

At each stop, Europeans are grappling in different ways with new and unsettling realities after the US president appeared in recent weeks to herald the end of Pax Americana.

In London, rightly or wrongly, and perhaps out of sheer necessity, the idea of the special relationship remains a comfort blanket. There is a new steely resolve in Brussels but the temptation persists to push decisions back.

A leading German politician described the incoming government in Berlin as “democracy's last bullet” but some worry they will shoot themselves in the foot. Austrians cling to their traditional neutrality as if that alone will keep them safe. In Poland, there is, perhaps, the greatest clarity as to what they think must be done. Yet its polarised political class, traditionally Atlanticist in outlook and discombobulated by the turn in Washington, argues about how to find the money to do it as public opinion wavers over the presence of 1 million Ukrainian refugees. As the Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci was quoted as saying in 1929: “The old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born; now is the time of monsters.”

There was a sense of quiet satisfaction in the Ministry of Defence's main building on Whitehall when, during one of his unpredictable press huddles in the Oval Office last week, Donald Trump said he was pleased that Nato was “stepping up”. It is a phrase that the British defence secretary, John Healey, had been pushing as part of Britain's effort to keep Washington engaged. Now it was being echoed in the White House.

The first person Healey called after the announcement that the UK would increase its spending on defence to 2.5% of GDP by April 2027 was his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth. In the six weeks the American has been in office, Healey has spoken to him four times, twice in person. Meanwhile, at 6pm every Tuesday evening, Britain's defence secretary rings his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov. “It's very clear that a precondition for the US taking European security seriously is Europe showing we are taking our own security seriously,” a Whitehall source said.

Few would dispute that Keir Starmer and Healey have been pulling all the diplomatic levers at their disposal. Richard Shirreff, formerly a British general and previously Nato's European deputy supreme allied commander, believes “the prime minister is still trying to be a bridge between Trump and Nato” and if the US is up for that “then fantastic”.

“But from a purely security perspective, I think we have to accept that Europe and Canada have got to stand on their own without America,” he says. “We've got to get real. America has not just drifted away. It's cut itself off. Anybody who thinks that America is still committed to Nato is … I don't know what they're smoking.

“You have to assume that the American security guarantee for Europe has gone. We are in a new world. The French have been absolutely right about strategic autonomy, and the British line that America ‘will always be the leader of Nato' has been proved completely wrong.”

He adds: “The only way that we are going to avoid catastrophe in Europe is through effective deterrence and to deter effectively means you have to be ready for the worst case.

“The worst case is war with Russia, and this means that we have to look to not just increasing the size and capability of our armed forces, we have to build societal resilience.

“We have to look at home defence. We have to look at civil defence, and we have to look to the mobilisation of industries, building up a war economy – the whole nine yards.”

The timetable for the Eurostar services from London St Pancras to Brussels once defined the parameters of the working day for Georg Riekeles, as an EU official dealing with British Brexit negotiators.

Riekeles, a Norwegian, has worked in the Brussels institutions for about 15 years, most recently as a diplomatic adviser to Michel Barnier. Today, nursing a small Vedett beer in Le Coin du Diable bar in the shadow of the European Commission's towering headquarters, he is taking a break from his work for the European Policy Centre thinktank. “It's no overstatement to say that European countries are facing the most dire situation they have faced since the end of the second world war,” he says.

Some of the barricades that fortified the EU quarter during a summit of leaders are yet to be removed but the circus has moved on. EU leaders agreed to “become more sovereign [and] more responsible for its own defence”. They endorsed a decision to open up €150bn (£125bn) in loans for European defence spending, and to relax the rules on spending and debt rules to allow Europe to potentially raise a further €650bn over the next four years for arms.

After years of France vainly banging the drum for strategic autonomy from the US, European leaders' hands have been forced by Trump's suspension of military aid and intelligence support to Ukraine, now reinstated, the start of bilateral peace talks with Vladimir Putin and the imminent attack on European businesses through import tariffs.

The summit should be seen as the first of a series of European “war councils”, Riekeles says. He predicts that financial and military support for Ukraine will ratchet up as forms of hard security arrangements less dependent on the US are being worked out. But “this is not a system where you can just push a button”.

It is in the “European DNA” to “want to think that the world is globalising, that a more open world and interdependence is a condition for security, rather than dependencies or interdependencies being at risk of creating a security risk”, says Riekeles.

The reality is that it will take a little time to respond to the “new world”, he says. “Think of Germany, I mean, they decided to rely on Russia for their energy, for China for trade and the US for security,” says Riekeles. “All three of them are gone.”

As the high-speed train from Brussels Midi to Frankfurt enters Aachen station, on the Belgian-German border, two officers in the black uniform of the polizei spot something and start to run along the platform. They board the train and zero in on a black man halfway down coach 23. “Where is your ID card?” they demand of the man in English, after he fails to understand their German. He duly offers his passport. His papers are in order. They move on. “Always the same,” says Dr Oliver Gnad, who runs the Bureau of Current Affairs thinktank in Frankfurt. “It feels super uncomfortable. It starts to become a racist system.”

In 2022, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights found that more people of sub-Saharan African heritage were stopped by police in Germany (33%) than in any other European country apart from Austria (40%) in the previous five-year period.

Immigrants and asylum seekers have become a target for politicians seeking to assuage the anger of those at the rough end of Germany's ailing economy  and failing infrastructure, as epitomised by a much-maligned rail network.

After the most recent election, Germany's chancellor in waiting, Friedrich Merz, the leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union, announced a plan to make constitutional amendments to unleash up to €1tn in defence and infrastructure spending. “Germany is back,” he said.

Merz has a small window to push the plan through before the new Bundestag is convened on 25 March with its blocking group of the far-right, pro-Kremlin Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and the Left party.

Prof Matthias Moosdorf, a cellist by profession with a hairstyle worthy of the pop star Leo Sayer in his pomp, is the AfD's foreign policy spokesperson in the Bundestag.

The MP says he joined the party after being ostracised for his belief that Germany had a problem of “other cultures not related to our culture”. “My colleagues from the music world said, ‘OK, you are now engaged with this Nazi party, and we don't allow you to give any concert any more',” he says.

Moosdorf believes Vladimir Putin does not pose a threat to Germany and that the rush to change the constitution to increase spending was “anti-democratic”.

“We are a dysfunctional country,” he says. “We have all the migration problems. We have all the problems with deindustrialisation. It doesn't make any sense for the biggest country like Russia to risk a war against Nato, against Germany. This is completely nonsense.”

The AfD became Germany's second largest party after winning 20.8% of the vote in the election, and is by far the dominant force in east Germany.

“If they [the government] don't deliver on my cost of living, if they don't deliver on ‘I feel threatened by mass immigration and we don't integrate them', then I think the AfD is going to rise to probably the biggest party in the next elections,” says Gnad, who was forced to work from home today because of a transport strike.

One of his friends is Ben Hodges, who was the commanding general of the United States army Europe until his retirement in 2018. He lives in Frankfurt with his German-American wife.

“This is anything but a peace plan, it is a surrender,” says Hodges, 66, of Trump's recent intervention.

“I think it's pathetic that Europe has taken so long to get its act together and combine its economies to challenge Russia,” he adds. “You could shut down Russia economically, if you were serious about it. But I'm afraid there's too many countries in Europe are still benefiting from Russian crime.”

The distinctive gondolas of the Wiener Riesenrad, the grand ferris wheel in Vienna's Prater park, appear unchanged since they featured in the film noir classic The Third Man. The film's director, Carol Reed, and author, Graham Greene, explored the moral ambiguity of postwar Vienna and the immanent good and evil of mankind.

There is no shortage of ambiguity in Austria's approach to Ukraine. Agreement on a new centrist coalition government was reached a few weeks ago, and while Austria has been a neutral state since the second world war, it has affirmed its support for Ukrainian sovereignty. Yet Austria was within a whisker of having its first far-right-led government since 1945, and one that is openly pro-Kremlin. The Freedom party (FPÖ) won the largest share of the vote in the recent election with 28.85% of votes cast. Coalition talks fell by the wayside over the party's demands for control over the interior ministry, among other issues.

Austria would have probably joined Hungary and Slovakia as potential blocks on EU efforts to support Ukraine. The FPÖ's leader, and the country's prospective chancellor, Herbert Kickl, has spoken of the “long history of provocations, including by the US and Nato”.

It offers a worrying portent of what could happen in Germany, suggests Marcus How, the head analyst at VE Insight, an investment risk adviser. “Politically, it's always been a bit of a kind of canary in the coalmine,” he says.

Sipping on a glass of apple juice in Cafe Landtmann, a favourite of Sigmund Freud, Thomas Hofer, a former journalist who reported on the FPÖ and now runs a political consultancy, says there is a tendency, exhibited in varying degrees by a lot of Europeans, for Austrians to believe they can float above world events. “Don't you feel all right? Isn't it nice? Isn't it comfortable?” he says.

It has been a tense few weeks at the Polonia wax museum (“So bad, it's good” was a recent review) a short walk from Kraków's central station. They were not sure whether to save their money for a new pope, when the sculptures cost up to €12,000 each. Following reassuring news about the health of the pope from the Vatican, the owner, Marian Dreszer, opted to update his models of Trump, Volodymr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader has been on display in the basement in a jail cell due to incidences of him being spat upon and punched by visitors. The three men will be put around a negotiating table, says Dreszer. “But maybe Trump will be spat at too now,” says his son Maciej.

It has been a particularly distressing time for Poles of a certain age as the Trump administration reveals its seeming indifference to European security, says Dr Natasza Styczyńska, an associate professor at Kraków's Jagiellonian University.

“It's a huge disappointment especially for the traditionally pro-Atlantic generation, people who still remember communism, for whom America was always the embodiment of democracy, freedom, minority rights, you know, all of these things we didn't have,” she says. “For this generation this is a shock.”

There is, however, near unanimity that part of the response must be to ramp up defence spending.

Poland will spend an expected 4.7% of GDP on defence this year, the highest among the Europeans in Nato. The prime minister, Donald Tusk, has spoken of the potential for Poland to acquire a nuclear deterrent. He has further proposed more than doubling Poland's army to 500,000 troops and establishing compulsory military training for all adult men by the end of the year.

But all this has a cost. And in Kraków's city hall, Aleksander Miszalski, a mayor with ambitions to revitalise the transport system and open new parks, says money is tight. A debate is raging about how to find cash at all levels of government. “Inflation and rising cost of salaries and energy are big problems,” he says.

Next month Miszalski, 44, who is a political ally of Tusk's and regional chair of his Civic Platform party, will travel to Warsaw for a meeting about civil defence – and building bunkers. “We've got like 5% of what we need,” he says. “We have a lot of them but very small. In hotels, old bunkers, small bunkers. We need to hide 1 million people in case of something … You have to change what you have been thinking about for the last decades.”

The grand, white-stone railway station at Przemyśl, close to the Polish-Ukrainian border, has been a first port of call for hundreds of thousands of refugees from the war in Ukraine. What was a deluge is now a trickle but the numbers being taken in at the Hope Foundation refugee centre, a place for short-term stays, tend to swell when Russian strikes are at their heaviest.

They are looking after just 15 people at the moment – and that is just as well. Their funders' promise of a new furnace was killed off by Trump's decision to end USAid support in Ukraine. The online psychological support provided by a Greek NGO was also terminated as a result of the White House decision. “The impact was immediate,” says a local volunteer, Jacek Wiarski. “It's unpredictable because of the blond-hair guy.”

Maryna Drasbaieva, 21, who has been in the centre for nearly a year after escaping Kherson, the partially occupied region of south Ukraine, was a trainee baker at home and delights the other residents with her pancakes. She shakes her head, and looks away when asked whether Trump could bring peace. “I hate politics,” she says. “There was too much dying at home. My mum needs an operation. We want to go to Germany.”

It has not been easy to keep the centre going, with some local resentment bubbling up in the last two years at the 1 million Ukrainian refugees in the country. A recent posting on social media asking for donations received a depressing response, says Wiarski. “They write, ‘Why do you want to support them?'” he says. “‘Why are they getting our money from the social security?'”

It is the start of spring in western Europe but as the train passes through Medyka, the border crossing between Poland and Ukraine, the sky is sleet-grey and there is heavy snow.

In the train's second carriage, Anastasia Krapyva is returning to Kyiv to see her family. She left Ukraine in 2023 for Germany, where she works in a laundry, and admits to having mixed feelings about coming home. It scares her a bit.

“It's no good,” she says. “What Donald Trump is doing is not good for Ukraine. It might be good for Russia but not Ukraine.”

During a visit to the Unbroken national rehabilitation centre in Lviv, Serhiy Kiral, the city's deputy mayor, who also has a responsibility for international cooperation and visited Washington in that capacity shortly before the presidential inauguration, is no less despairing of the American approach.

He quotes Henry Kissinger: “To be an enemy of America can be dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal.”

“What will the Americans decide?” asks Kiral. “Are they going to side with Putin again? I think at some point, if that continues, we'll probably have to say ‘enough is enough. You know, you're either with Ukraine or you are with Russia.”

He believes Europe can fill the gaps left by the US. “What is the alternative?” he asks.

Illia Dmytryshyn, 26, is a paratrooper who took a bullet to his thigh in Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, and watched as a friend trying to rescue him was blown in half by a drone.

“We've already lost so much,” he says. “If the Europeans do step in and start helping more, that would definitely help. But even if they don't, we are still going to keep fighting and defending our land to the last metre.”

Raphaël Glucksmann quips that US should give back 19th-century gift from France over Trump's approach to Ukraine

A French European parliament member has quipped that the US should return the Statue of Liberty, which it received as a gift from France about 140 years ago, after Donald Trump's decision “to side with the tyrants” against Ukraine.

Trump's White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, then responded to Raphaël Glucksmann on Monday by calling him an “unnamed low-level French politician” and saying the US would keep the statue.

Taunting France's conquest by Nazi Germany during the second world war before the allied forces – including the US – then defeated the Nazis, Leavitt added: “It's only because of America that the French are not speaking German right now.” She also said France “should be very grateful to our great country”.

Glucksmann, of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, kicked off the exchange when – evidently with his tongue in his cheek – he said it appeared to him that the US had come to “despise” the statue as well as what it symbolizes.

“So, it will be just fine here at home,” Glucksmann said.

Glucksmann also referred to a crackdown on “scientific freedom” in the US in his remarks at a party convention, first reported by Agence France-Presse.

His comments amount to a verbal protest after Trump suspended military aid and intelligence gathering on Ukraine, in an apparent attempt to strong-arm its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in the negotiations to end the war started by Russia, which invaded in February 2022.

The US president upbraided Zelenskyy during a televised diplomatic meltdown in the Oval Office on 28 February, which caused significant alarm across Europe for appearing to signal that the Trump administration generally favors Russia in the conflict. The US later restored military aid, but on Monday it was reported the US was withdrawing from an international body formed to investigate responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine.

Trump and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, for whom the US president has repeatedly expressed admiration, are tentatively scheduled to talk on Tuesday over the phone about ending the war in Ukraine.

Glucksmann's remarks additionally nodded to Elon Musk's brutal staffing and spending cuts to the US federal government, which have affected numerous health and climate research workers. Glucksmann said France could be in a position to benefit if any of the fired workers emigrated.

“If you want to fire your best researchers, if you want to fire all the people who, through their freedom and their sense of innovations, their taste for doubt and research, have made your country the world's leading power, then we're going to welcome them,” said Glucksmann.

“Give us back the Statue of Liberty. We're going to say to the Americans who have chosen to side with the tyrants, to the Americans who fired researchers for demanding scientific freedom: ‘Give us back the Statue of Liberty.' We gave it to you as a gift.”

France did indeed present the 305ft-tall, 450,000lb Statue of Liberty to the US in Paris on 4 July 1884, the 108th anniversary of the American declaration of independence from the UK. The US needed crucial military aid from France to win its revolutionary war and gain independence from the UK.

Nicknamed “Lady Liberty”, the torch-bearing statue – designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi of France – was then installed on an island in New York City's harbor and dedicated in 1886. There is a smaller copy of the statue on an island in the Seine river in Paris.

A bronze plaque on the Statue of Liberty's pedestal contains the words of a poem titled The New Colossus, which overtly references the large number of immigrants who arrived in the US in the 19th century and partially reads: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.”

Trump has been aggressively pursuing the deportation of immigrants. Recently, his administration deported a Brown University medical professor to Lebanon, despite her having a valid US work visa and a judge's order not to do so.

Prosecutors reportedly alleged that the professor had recently attended the funeral of Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, among other things.

The US also recently deported to El Salvador more than 250 people whom the White House accused of belonging to Venezuelan and Salvadorian gangs, despite a judge's order halting the flight.

Research shows dramatic reversal of decades of net outflow to Israel, as new arrivals bring cultural influences

Israelis making a new home in Europe have become vital to previously declining Jewish communities on the continent, boosting numbers, bringing a range of cultural influences and marking a fundamental change in the relationship between the diaspora and the Jewish state, research has revealed.

A report released on Wednesday by the London-based Institute for Jewish Policy Research will detail for the first time a dramatic reversal of decades of net outflow to Israel from Jewish communities in Europe.

“We can say that culturally and demographically there is a real turning point. Possibly the end of an era,” said Dr Daniel Staetsky, the report's author. “The founders of the state of Israel would never have imagined that it would be Israel that would be rejuvenating European Jewish communities, not the other way around.”

Recent Israeli government statistics show accelerating emigration from Israel, driven by factors including political polarisation, the high cost of living, the impact of wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and security concerns after the bloody Hamas raid into Israel of October 2023 and Iranian attacks.

The biggest destination remains the US but many of Europe's Jewish communities have also received a significant demographic boost, with some that have been shrinking for decades due to an elderly population and a low birthrate now growing again.

Researchers at the IJPR found about 630,000 Jewish people born in Israel or who had lived there for a significant time are now living elsewhere in the world. There are also about 330,000 people born overseas to one or two parents who are Israeli nationals whom the report described as “Israel-connected”.

The researchers used new government statistics to establish a definitive figure for Germany's Israeli and Israeli-connected Jewish population after decades of only rough estimates. At 24,000 this was higher than previously thought, making the Israeli-connected community in Germany the biggest in Europe.

Nearly half of the Jewish population in Norway was Israel-connected, the report said, as well as 41% in Finland, and more than 20% of Jewish communities in Bulgaria, Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark.

Jonathan Boyd, the JPR's director, said the new arrivals were having a big impact. “In the UK there are about 23,000 Israel-born people. That's close to twice as many as 20 years ago but among a total Jewish population of an estimated 313,000. In the smaller countries such as the Netherlands the influx can have a much bigger impact. In Norway or Finland it only takes a few to settle to make a big difference.”

“Wherever they go Israelis bring something with them. They bring aspects of day-to-day Israeli culture into these countries.”

The use of Hebrew and Israeli names for children has become more widespread in many Jewish communities in Europe and cuisine based on eastern European traditions is being replaced by contemporary Israeli cooking in some places.

Close to 12,000 people from Israel and their children now live in the Netherlands.

“There are a lot of Israelis here now and that is changing the composition of the Jewish community,” said Asjer Waterman, a strategic adviser at JMW, the national welfare organisation for the Dutch Jewish community. “Of course they have a different identity and history to Dutch Jews.”

Itay Garmy, a councillor in Amsterdam born in the Netherlands whose father was Israeli, said the Israeli community in the city was often more secular than the historic Jewish community, which “was already pretty secular”.

“Our connection with Israel is more based on culture than faith. It's more about music, food and love of Israel as a second home for Jewish people than religion,” said Garmy, 31.

Other Israeli immigrants have found a new interest in religion after moving overseas.

“Until a year ago I regarded myself as Israeli but recently I am feeling more my Jewish identity,” said Avisar Lev, who moved to Berlin from Tel Aviv in 2012.

Lev said he had not personally experienced any antisemitism, which EU data suggests has risen sharply in recent years, and is widely reported in Israel.

Many of the arrivals from Israel are well educated, relatively young and have children in their new homes.

Official statistics in Israel show that emigration from Israel was nearly 83,000 in 2024, more than double the number between 2009 and 2021, and higher than 2022. Population growth was down from 1.6% to 1.1%, even though about 33,000 people arrived from other countries and 23,000 Israelis returned.

A parliamentary committee last month attributed the decline to “a significant increase in negative migration amid the complex security situation”, and called for a reform of lengthy and bureaucratic immigration processes.

The emigration has prompted concern in the Israeli media. A recent editorial in the Yedioth Ahronoth daily newspaper was entitled: “It's no wonder people are leaving Israel”. Others have warned of a “brain drain”.

Last year, Prof Aaron Ciechanover, one of Israel's leading scientists, blamed efforts by the current government to introduce controversial judicial changes for the rise in departures. Those leaving “want to live in a free, liberal-democratic country, and not in a country where the government is forcibly taking power,” Ciechanover said.

The IJPR report was about the impact on Jewish communities of the new migration and therefore focused on Jewish Israelis, not Arab Israelis.

 By Fatos Bytyci 

 KOCANI, North Macedonia -Sporadic violence broke out in North Macedonia on Monday as thousands of people demanded justice for 59 people killed in a nightclub blaze and called for an end to the corruption that they say was behind the country's worst disaster in years. 

 The fire broke out during a hip hop concert in the town of Kocani at around 3 a.m. on Sunday when sparks from flares set a patch of ceiling alight. Hundreds of people scrambled for the unlicensed venue's only exit as flames spread across the roof. 

 The incident has shattered the town of 25,000 people, 50 miles east of the capital Skopje. Bulldozers and workers with shovels dug a line of fresh graves in the town's cemetery on Monday. People with missing loved ones queued outside the hospital to give DNA samples in case their relatives were not immediately identifiable. 

 Officials said that the "Pulse" nightclub's licence was illegally obtained and that the venue lacked fire extinguishers and emergency exits. More than 150 people were injured. 

 "I want everyone who helped this place carry on with its business to be jailed," said 16-year-old Jovan, who said he lost a friend in the fire. "We need change because this is a corrupt country." 

 Jovan joined thousands of others in a quiet protest in Kocani's central square on Monday. People hugged and cried as they lined up to light candles for the dead and write messages of condolence. 

 Some held placards that read: "We are not dying from accidents; we are dying from corruption" and "Everything is legal here if you have connections". Hundreds more held a vigil in central Skopje.  

 Violence broke out briefly when a group of people used rocks to smash out the windows of a pub that three protesters said was run by the same person who owned "Pulse".  

 Later hundreds of people descended on the mayor's home, throwing rocks and smashing windows. Next door, a family who had lost a relative in the fire looked on in tears.  

 NO WAY OUT  

 The club, which local media described as a former carpet warehouse, is a squat building with a corrugated iron roof that backs onto a grassy vacant lot. It had just one emergency exit, which was locked during Sunday's concert, two fire extinguishers and no fire alarm or sprinkler system, North Macedonia's state prosecutor Ljupco Kocevski said.  

 "It did not have two exit doors, but only one single improvised metal door at the back of the building, which was locked and without a handle on the inside," Kocevski said. 

 The ceiling was made of flammable materials and the plasterboard walls were not fire-resistant. Reuters pictures on Monday showed the club's roof burned through and collapsed in places, its interior wooden beams exposed and blackened. 

 " operated in substandard conditions. It does not have this and that, and people were making money from it. Who is responsible?" said Sasa Djenic, a school teacher whose 15-year-old daughter escaped the fire with burns on her arms. 

 Draghi Stojanov's son died in the fire. "After this tragedy, what do I need this life for? I had one child and I lost him," he told Reuters. 

 ILLEGAL LICENCE 

 Authorities have arrested about 20 people in connection with the fire, including government officials and the nightclub's manager. 

 State prosecutor Kocevski said his office was working to determine the criminal liability of a number of people for "serious offences against public security" and other crimes. 

 "The individuals acted contrary to the regulations and technical rules of the protection measures and thereby caused a danger to the life and work of people on a large scale," he said. 

 Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski said the club's licence was issued illegally by the economy ministry and said that those responsible would face justice. Former economy minister Kreshnik Bekteshi was questioned by police over the disaster, the local TV 5 broadcaster said. 

 Fifty-one people were treated in hospitals in Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Turkey. Burn specialists from Serbia, the Czech Republic and Israel were expected in North Macedonia on Monday to assist local medical staff. More would be taken to hospitals in Croatia and Romania, officials said.

Syrian troops exchanged fire with Lebanese soldiers and armed groups in northeast Lebanon overnight and into Monday in a new round of clashes along the border.There have been frictions along the mountainous frontier in the months since Islamist rebels toppled Syria's Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Tehran and Iran-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, and installed their own institutions and army.Late on Sunday, Syria's defense ministry accused Hezbollah of crossing into Syrian territory and kidnapping and killing three members of Syria's new army.  Hezbollah denied any involvement. A Lebanese security source told Reuters the three Syrian soldiers had crossed into Lebanese territory first and were killed by armed members of a tribe in northeastern Lebanon who feared their town was under attack.In retaliation for their deaths, Syrian troops shelled Lebanese border towns overnight, according to the Syrian defense ministry and the Lebanese army. Residents of the town of Al-Qasr, less than one kilometer from the border, told Reuters they fled further inland to escape the bombardment.

Aoun said the state would not allow clashes along the border to continue.Handing over bodiesLebanon's army said in a statement on Monday that it had handed over the bodies of the three killed Syrians to Syrian authorities, and that it had responded to fire from Syrian territory and sent reinforcements to the border area. Syria's army sent a convoy of troops and several tanks to the frontier on Monday, according to a Reuters reporter along the border. Syrian troops fired into the air as they moved through towns on the way to the border."Large military reinforcements were brought in to reinforce positions along the Syrian-Lebanese border and prevent any breaches in the coming days," said Maher Ziwani, the head of a Syrian army division deploying to the border.

In a major step for cooperation on global security, intelligence chiefs and national security advisers of several countries including three members of the Five Eyes alliance have gathered in New Delhi. Besides key meetings, the intel chiefs will attend The Raisina Dialogue - a multilateral conference organised by the Observer Research Foundation and India's Ministry of External Affairs.

Five Eyes is an international intelligence alliance comprising the US, UK, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. The alliance originally evolved from a secret World War II partnership between cypher and code breaking teams from Britain and the United States.

Three of the Five Eyes members - US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, UK's National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell and New Zealand's intelligence chief Andrew Hampton - are in New Delhi for the three-day summit, which will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is also in New Delhi and will be the chief guest at the global conference.

During their visit, the global intelligence chiefs also attended a top strategy conference organised by the National Security Council Secretariat, where they were hosted by India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. R&AW chief Ravi Sinha and Intelligence Bureau or IB chief Tapan Deka were also present at the top-level meeting.

The meeting, organised by India, shows New Delhi's growing global role in strategic and security matters. It also assumes significance amid concerns of radicalisation and rise of extremist elements in Canada by 'Khalistani' separatist groups.

The intelligence chief are also attending The Raisina Dialogue, which is seeing a participation and attendance from more than 120 countries who have sent Heads of States, Heads of Governments, spy chiefs, top ministers, military commanders, tech bosses, industry leaders, research analysts, scholars, think tank chiefs, and experts on matters of strategy and geopolitics.

The Ministry of External Affairs has said that the theme for the 2025 Raisina Dialogue will be 'Kalachakra - People, Peace, And Planet'. The global multilateral conference, which will be held over three days, will have six main themes:

2025 will mark the 10th Edition of the Raisina Dialogue.

India has been highflying in chess recently, and the icing on the cake was D Gukesh's World Championship victory in Singapore last year, where he defeated Ding Liren. Meanwhile, Koneru Humpy also became the Women's World Rapid Champion.

The current live chess rankings have three Indian GMs in the top-ten, with Gukesh in third position, behind Magnus Carlsen and second-placed Hikaru Nakamura. Meanwhile, Arjun Erigaisi is in fifth position and R Praggnanandhaa is eighth.

After his sensational Prague Masters campaign, Aravindh Chithambaram had a huge jump, climbing eight places higher to World No. 14. Meanwhile, India legend Viswanathan Anand has fallen to 15th.

Recently, Anand spoke to TV9 Telugu, where he was asked about India's new GMs, and he passed his verdict on the likes of Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa and Arjun.

“In some ways we already are the superpower in chess. There are many metrics by which we are. There are many measures by which some of the country is. We are not dominant like the Soviet Union used to be, but if you take for instance the age of our top players with me as an exception, well I think the oldest one is 21,” he said.

“They're all incredibly young which means they have a long time ahead. Second. they are all in the top 10 together or in the top 20 top 50, then the number keeps increasing. They're all there together and can you imagine how fantastic that is for us because they will not only try to have the best results, but the moment one of them has a good result, all the others will be motivated to catch up. So they have this beautiful combination of friendship and rivalry,” he added.

Recently, Nihal Sarin also climbed two spots higher in the rankings, and is currently World No. 41. Meanwhile, Vidit Gujrathi is 24th and Harikrishna Pentala is 30th.

Palestinians in Gaza face severe food shortages due to Israel's blockade, forcing many to rely on charities for meals. Aid groups warn that famine risks are rising despite previous ceasefire gains.

A charity in northern Gaza has been distributing hot meals to war-weary Palestinians during Ramadan, as they struggle to feed their families under Israel's two-week blockade of Gaza. Many have turned to aid groups for food.

“We were forced to come to the charity due to the scarcity of materials,” said Hassan Radwan from Jabaliya refugee camp, where many live in tents over destroyed homes.

Aid groups warn that famine risks are rising, despite gains made during a recent ceasefire.

US Intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard, who is on an official visit to India, reiterated President Donald Trump's unwavering commitment to defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism, which she termed as a direct and ongoing danger to the American people.

Gabbard underscored that Prime Minister Narendra Modi also takes the threat of terrorism seriously, emphasising that both nations are dedicated to addressing this persistent threat together.

In an interview with ANI, Gabbard discussed how terrorism impacts not only the US but also India, Bangladesh, Syria, Israel and different parts of the Middle East.

“President Trump, through his first administration in the presidency, and it continues now, has been very clear about his commitment to defeating this threat of Islamist terrorism that has unfortunately plagued us, and continues to pose a direct threat to the American people.”

"But, we see how it's been impacting people here in India, in Bangladesh, currently ongoing in Syria, Israel and different countries in the Middle East. So this is a threat that I know Prime Minister Modi also takes seriously and one where the leaders of our two countries will work together to try to identify and defeat that threat," she added.

Gabbard, who is the Director of National Intelligence in the United States, expressed her commitment to ensuring that the US intelligence community is focused on its core mission of securing the nation, seeking out the truth and reporting the truth so that US President Donald Trump can make the best informed decisions.

"So, in my role as Director of National Intelligence, this is one area that is my singular priority when it comes to ensuring that our intelligence community is focused on its core mission of securing our country, seeking out the truth and reporting that truth so that our president can make the best-informed decisions. So, anything else that distracts from that, we want to get out of the way, whether it's these inappropriate chat rooms or the more serious threats that we've seen of the weaponization and politicization of our intelligence to undermine the fabric of our democratic republic," she added.

Meanwhile, India on Monday raised the issue of anti-India activities carried out by the banned pro-Khalistani organisation Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) in the US during the meeting of defence minister Rajnath Singh and Tulsi Gabbard, PTI reported citing sources.

Yemeni Houthis have twice attempted to attack the USS Harry S. Truman after at least 53 people have been killed and 98 injured after the U.S. launched a series of airstrikes on Yemen on Saturday, according to the Houthi health ministry.

A U.S. defense official told NBC News on Monday that the militia had launched two retaliatory attacks against the USS Harry S. Truman that had both been unsuccessful. 

The Houthis claimed to have attacked the U.S. aircraft carrier — the vessel is stationed in the Red Sea — in December and January, and the Yemeni Houthi Armed Forces said in a statement posted on Telegram on Monday that “we are confronting this criminal aggression and responding to escalation with escalation.”

A rebel spokesperson had told NBC News on Sunday that the group would respond with “more escalation,” after President Donald Trump said he ordered the airstrikes on Houthi-held areas of Yemen on Saturday and promised “overwhelming lethal force” until the group ceased attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

The Houthis, an Iran-backed militia that has taken over part of Yemen, including its capital, Sanaa, began launching missiles and drones and pursuing other attacks against shipping vessels in response to the war in Gaza.

The group reported explosions Saturday evening in Sanaa and Saada, the Houthi stronghold near the Saudi border.

Footage broadcast on Yemeni TV and published by The Associated Press showed vast destruction, with people searching for survivors as a bulldozer shifted rubble and ambulances arrived at the scene of the wreckage.

Photos showed black smoke rising over Sanaa's airport complex, which includes a military facility. Strikes were also reported in Hodeida, Bayda and Marib.

The attack came a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel's latest blockade on Gaza, which has halted the flow of aid into the enclave. There have been no reported attacks since this threat was made.

Nasr el-Din Amer, a spokesperson for the Houthis, told NBC News on Sunday that most of the casualties from the airstrikes were women and children, which NBC News has not independently verified.

Amer said the Houthis would continue their operations “until the blockade on Gaza is lifted.”

“We will respond to the recent escalation with further escalation,” he said. “Our response will not be delayed.”

Trump also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group and promised hold the country “fully accountable” for the actions of its proxy Houthi group. Tehran supports the Houthis with money, training and equipment.

In a statement to Iranian state media, Hossein Salami, the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, said Iran would “respond decisively and destructively” to any enemy taking threats into action.

But Salami also distanced Iran from the Houthis, emphasizing that the group made its strategic decisions independently.

“The Islamic Republic of Iran plays no role in shaping the national or operational policies of any resistance front group,” he said, in remarks that could be interpreted as a signal that the Houthis are on their own.

An annual $1 trillion flow of goods passes through the Red Sea.

The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of Israel's war in Gaza in late 2023 and January of this year, when the current ceasefire took effect.

Some shippers responded to the attacks late last year by suspending service in the region.

Earlier this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio redesignated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. The designation had been revoked by Joe Biden's Democratic administration over concerns it would badly affect the delivery of aid to Yemen, which was considered to be facing one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.

Syria's army attacked Lebanon after it said three soldiers were kidnapped, brought to Lebanon and killed by Hezbollah militants. Hezbollah denied involvement.

BEIRUT — The Syrian army fired rockets and artillery into northern Lebanon overnight after it said three of its soldiers were kidnapped, brought to Lebanon and killed by Hezbollah militants, in a violent escalation of simmering cross-border tensions.

Residents fled as Lebanese border towns came under attack and Syrian troops exchanged fire with local armed groups and Lebanese soldiers. Tensions across the two countries' porous border have been brewing since Syria's new Islamist leaders ousted Bashar al-Assad, a key ally of Hezbollah and Tehran, in December.

The spasm of violence had largely died down by dawn Monday but put on display how thinly spread Lebanon's army is at a time when it is also being tasked with enforcing the conditions of a ceasefire with Israel by ensuring that Hezbollah no longer operates in southern Lebanon.

It also came as Syria's new government, under rebel turned president Ahmed al-Sharaa, attempts to show that it can exert control over areas of Syrian territory traditionally supportive of the former regime and unify the country, following a wave of deadly sectarian violence along Syria's coast this month.

The Lebanon-Syria border has long operated as a key smuggling route for Hezbollah, and Syria's new government has promised to crack down on Iran using its soil as part of a network for smuggling arms and cash to its proxy forces.

Syrian state media said the three soldiers were ambushed near the Zeita Dam, west of Homs, and were killed on the spot after being taken to Lebanese territory. Hezbollah denied the accusations, saying in a statement it “has no connection to any events taking place within Syrian territory.”

The details surrounding the deaths of the soldiers could not be independently verified and remain unclear. Lebanese media reported that three armed men entered Lebanon first, resulting in clashes with local tribespeople who believed they were under attack. Many of the tribes in northeastern Lebanon are loyal to Hezbollah.

Syrian state media, citing an unnamed Defense Ministry official, said the Syrian army shelled “Hezbollah gatherings that killed the Syrian soldiers” along the border as they retaliated against the deaths. It was not immediately clear whether there were additional casualties on either side.

Al Arabiya, a Saudi-owned regional news outlet, said its cameraman and several other journalists sustained minor injuries reporting on the clashes. The outlet said their injuries were caused by a Hezbollah rocket falling near them.

The Lebanese army sent reinforcements to the northern border with Syria on Sunday evening and said that it responded to the source of fire and opened communication lines with Damascus to ease the tension. In the presence of the Lebanese army, the bodies of the soldiers were returned to Syrian territory, it said in a statement.

As Lebanese troops responded to Syrian fire in the north, Israel attacked Lebanon's southern border Sunday and Monday, Lebanese state media reported.

Israel's energy minister said Sunday that he would immediately cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip, in an apparent effort to pressure Hamas on negotiations after the first phase of a ceasefire deal expired on March 1. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.

        Trump on Saturday vowed to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks and warned that Tehran would be held “fully accountable” for its ally's actions.
    

The United States launched fresh airstrikes on Yemen on Monday, according to the Houthis' Al Masirah TV, with the rebel group and US President Donald Trump both vowing escalation.

Over the weekend, US strikes killed at least 53 people in Yemen, according to the Houthi-run Health Ministry, including five women and two children, and wounded almost 100 in the capital of Sanaa and other provinces, including Saada, the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia.

Euronews could not independently verify these claims.

The US began its new campaign of airstrikes on Yemen on Saturday after the Iran-backed Houthis said last week that they would renew attacks against Israeli vessels after Israel cut off the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza this month. 

On Monday, the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah and Al Jawf governorate north of the capital Sanaa were targeted, Al Masirah said.

Trump on Saturday vowed to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks and warned that Tehran would be held “fully accountable” for its ally's actions.

The US airstrikes were one of the most extensive attacks against the Houthis since the war in Gaza began in October 2023.

The Houthis have repeatedly targeted shipping in the Red Sea, sinking two vessels, in what they call acts of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel has been at war with Hamas, another Iranian ally. 

The attacks stopped when the Israel-Hamas ceasefire took hold in January — a day before Trump took office.

“We're not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot. And so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that," US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS on Sunday.

No Houthi attacks were reported before the weekend, but the group announced on Sunday that they had responded to Saturday's US strikes by launching an attack of 18 missiles and a drone on the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier and its accompanying warships in the northern Red Sea.

In a speech aired Sunday night, the Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi stated, “We will confront escalation with escalation.”

“We will respond to the American enemy in its raids, in its attacks, with missile strikes, by targeting its aircraft carrier, its warships, its ships,” al-Houthi said. “However, we also still have escalation options. If it continues its aggression, we will move to additional escalation options.”

On Sunday, head of Tehran's Revolutionary Guard Hossein Salami denied his country was involved in the Houthis' attacks, saying it “plays no role in setting the national or operational policies” of the militant groups it is allied with across the region, according to state-run media.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, writing on X, urged the US to halt its airstrikes and said Washington cannot dictate Iran's foreign policy.

The US and others have long accused Iran of providing military aid to the rebels. The US Navy has seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weaponry it said was bound for the Houthis.

The US, Israel and the UK previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but the new operation was conducted solely by Washington, marking the first strike on the Houthis under the second Trump administration.

From Russia's 2008 war in Georgia to its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and subsequent full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Black Sea region has been key to Putin's efforts to restore Russian power and influence after the fall of the Soviet Union. RUSI's Dr Neil Melvin explains why the Black Sea is so strategically important to Russia.

Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall pledges to ensure "trust and fairness in the social security system" ahead of expected cuts to the benefits system

The plans will be announced on Tuesday, but are already facing criticism from some Labour MPs and campaign groups

Diane Abbott says the government should introduce a wealth tax, rather than cutting or freezing payments

Keir Starmer's spokesman says there are moral and economic reasons to fix the UK's "broken" welfare system

"Three million people are out of work for health reasons, and one in eight young people not currently in work, education or training. So we've got a duty to fix the system," he says - BBC Verify has looked at these figures

Some Labour MPs want to borrow more instead of cutting benefits - but others argue this would spook the financial markets, writes our correspondent Henry Zeffman

Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall vowed the government's upcoming welfare reforms will ensure "fairness", as she faced a series of questions in the House of Commons.

The proposal has already sparked some backlash within the Labour party,asthe BBC's Economics editor Faisal Islam says. 

Amongst the critics is Diane Abbott who has called for a wealth tax as an alternative to the cuts - we have more on her counter-proposal.

A Downing Street spokesman earlier said that the government has a moral "duty to fix" the welfare system.

Kendall reassured the Commons that "proposals will soon become clear".

And that's true, on Tuesday she'll be making an announcement on the welfare reforms - we'll be providing live updates and analysis of that right here, so be sure to join us.

For now, we're pausing our coverage. You can keep up to date with the latest in our news story. Thanks for joining us.

With the government set to outline its plans for welfare reform on Tuesday, Westminster watchers are keeping a close eye on how Labour is both managing and reacting to possible changes. 

Here's a look at some of the rhetoric we've heard today:

What has the government said?

Work and pensions secretary Liz Kendallhas vowed to "get the welfare bill on a sustainable footing", as she urged colleagues to be "patient" ahead of the reforms. She added that "treating people with dignity and respect is at the heart of this government's plans".

The prime minister's spokesperson denied the notion that reforms are being introduced because of the UK's fiscal backdrop, instead saying the government has "a duty to fix the broken system that is letting millions of people in this country down".

Backlash from some Labour MPs

Welfare reform proposals have sparked an internal backlash within the Labour Party, writes BBC's Faisal Islam. We've taken a look at what some of them have been saying:

Today, the BBC heard from veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott, who urged the government should introduce a 2% wealth tax on people with assets worth more than £10 million, rather than make welfare cuts. 

Labour MP for Clapham and Brixton Hill, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, warned that cutting support or reducing eligibility "won't push more people into work, it will only push more people into poverty".

There are a trinity of trade-offs for the government as it prepares to shake up the benefits system.

How does it save money?

How does it increase the incentives for people to find a job?

And how does it protect those it has concluded are unquestionably reliant on the state, once it has defined who they are?

If ministers tack too far in any of these directions, they will probably undermine at least one of the other two, so you can see how fraught this is.

I am very aware at moments like this that we have an imperfect picture of what is to come.

It is incumbent on reporters to be responsible, and clear about what we don't know, so as not to cause unnecessary alarm.

There is a danger in under or over emphasising particular elements which may or may not happen or may, perhaps more likely, contain mitigations or nuances that we are not currently aware of.

Disability benefits are projected to see a sharp increase over the next five years, data from the Office for Budget Responsibility shows. 

Between 2024-2025, the benefit cost around £40bn but in 2029-2030 it is estimated to cost around £60bn.

Money spent on Universal Credit will remain much higher, while child benefits and "other spending" will remain steady.

By Gerry Georgieva 

When talking about the people
who are not in education, employment or training (NEETs), the shadow work and
pensions secretary Helen Whately said that "since Labour have been in
office, there are 100,000 more young people in exactly that situation".

This doesn't seem correct.

In April to June 2024, just
before Labour came into power, there were 908,000 young people who were NEET, external.

In the latest figures for
October to December 2024, there were 987,000 young people who were NEET. 

So the number has gone up by
79,000.

How could welfare benefits change?

There's been a lot of focus today on the amount of welfare spending for working-age adults. 

As we reported earlier, the prime minister's spokesperson raised the issue when defending the government's focus on reform. 

Asked by journalists if planned changes are coming as a result of the UK's fiscal backdrop, they said no.

Instead they pointed to, among other things, the UK having the "highest level of working-age inactivity due to ill health in western Europe". 

Welfare spending on working age adults - defined as those aged between 16 and 64 - was £48.5 billion in 2023-24. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projects it is due to rise to £75.7 billion in 2029-30, as the graph below illustrates.

A think thank chief says tightening eligibility criteria for Personal Independence Payments (PIP) is "unlikely to have a huge effect on work incentives".

Ruth Curtice, Resolution Foundation's chief executive, tells BBC's Radio 4's World at One that the change is "likely to concentrate all of the income losses on a small number of claimants".

She warns this will have a "really significant effect" on those impacted. She adds that there is much about the benefits system, other than eligibility, which could be improved.

Earlier today the prime minister's
spokesman told journalists: “Three million people are out of work for
health reasons, and one in eight young people not currently in work, education
or training. So we've got a duty to fix the system.”

He is correct, according to the latest figures from theOffice for National Statistics (ONS), external, which show that of the 9.3 million people in the UK who were economically
inactive between October and December last year, three million were not working
because they were sick.

On the second part of the
claim, in the same period there were around 987,000 people aged 16 to 24
years in the UK who were not in education, employment or training, which wasaround 13.4% of the total, external – that's about one in eight.

 But both of these figures come from the Labour Force
Survey, which the ONS says should be treated with “caution” at the moment
because fewer people have been agreeing to participate in it.

Since coming to power Keir Starmer has made some controversial decisions - reducing winter fuel allowance, hiking national insurance for employers and slashing the Foreign Aid budget. 

But the looming cuts to welfare will be the toughest test yet of Labour MPs' loyalty. Many have only voiced their unease privately but that could change when they see the details of exactly how disability benefits will be cut. 

Remember, David Cameron's Conservative government had to back down over similar plans in 2016. The government says the welfare system needs reform to help more people to work, but ministers need to persuade Labour MPs that this isn't just a cost cutting exercise.

MPs have just finished quizzing ministers at the regular work and pensions session in the House of Commons. 

The government's plans to bring forward welfare reforms came up several times. Here's what we heard:

Green Party MP Sian Berry says the government's "active trailing of welfare cuts has generated genuine fear". 

She asks if Kendall will apologise for this and reassure the public that benefit changes will not take place this year. 

Labour MP Stephen Timms, responds, saying he recognises that there has been a "good deal of anxiety".

"I regret that that has occurred," he says, adding that the proposals will soon become clear and that he thinks Berry will welcome them. 

In our next post, we'll bring you a recap of the key lines, following questions on benefits reform in the House of Commons.

The shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately is back with another question, she asks if Kendall has a "collective agreement" on the plans she is due to announce on Tuesday.

"Given all the media briefings, the apprehension of disabled people and the growing number of people not working, none of us would want to see that delayed," Whately states. She claims that Kendall still doesn't have the support of her cabinet with less than 24 hours to go.

Kendall says Whately will have to "show a little patience".

In response to Whately, she adds: "She talks about plans - we've seen her and the shadow chancellor writing in various newspapers claiming about their plan, but there never was a plan."

Questions to Liz Kendall in the House of Commons have just concluded, stay with us as we continue to bring you the latest updates and analysis.

Former Conservative Cabinet minister Sir Jeremy Wright asks about reforming the Personal Independence Payments (PIP) reassessment process.

He suggests that for those whose conditions are not going to improve "it would be sensible to relieve them of the burden" of that process.

This would lead to "less distress for them, saving money in the system and allowing people who do need reassessment to be reassessed faster", he adds.

Kendall says she agrees with a lot of what he says. 

She asks the House to be patient and look at the full proposals the government "will be putting forward imminently".

Questions have now turned away from McGovern and back to Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall.

Labour MP David Williams, referencing his constituent who was "badly let down by a flawed PIP assessment", asks what steps will be taken to ensure people are treated with fairness and dignity, and given the support they need. 

Kendall says treating people with dignity and respect is at "the heart of the government's plans".

She adds that she regularly meets disabled people who are denied the chance of work.

"That is what we want to put right, to make sure that the social security system is there for those who need it - not just now, but for years to come," she adds. 

Labour MP Neil Duncan-Jordan, asks if McGovern will acknowledge that disabled people need more investment to help them, rather than freezes and cuts.

"I do agree," replies Alison McGovern. 

The work and pensions minister adds: "We see potential in every single person in this country and many of those, who have been written off and left on the scrap heap, deserve a much better pathway back into work."

Conservative MP Lincoln Jopp says people in his Spelthorne constituency don't mind paying taxes for a  safety net for the most vulnerable, but claims they "really do get annoyed when they see their taxes going to people who are scamming the benefit system". 

He asks ministers about "so-called sickfluencer sites" - where he says people are shown how to "play the benefit system". 

Alison McGovern, work and pensions minister, says the government's fraud bill is currently passing through Parliament and the issue he has raised is "at the forefront" of the relevant minister's attention.

They will take "every step" possible to deal with issues in that area, she says.

Liberal Democrat MP Liz Jarvis asks Labour's Stephen Timms if he can assure those who are unable to work that they won't see their benefits cut.

Timms says he is concerned about the level of anxiety and speculation in recent weeks.

He says that he recognises the concerns, without directly answering the question. 

He adds that the current welfare system is failing, and the government is aiming to make the system sustainable so it is around in the future.

Shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately asks Kendall why 100,000 more young people are "not in education, employment or training, since the Labour government came into power".

Kendall responds by hitting back at the "legacy of 14 years of a Conservative government".

"She had 14 years to solve that situation, and their record is clear - nearly one million young people not in education, employment or training - one in eight of all of our young people."

She adds that the Conservative legacy is one her government is "determined" to change.

Liberal Democrat MP Max Wilkinson cites a report which he says finds that young people with disabilities face particular difficulty when trying to access work. 

He says when ministers make decisions to welfare changes, the report will be properly considered. 

"Absolutely,' Kendall says, adding that he will soon hear more about the government's plans, which will include "proper employment support".

The White House says "we've never been closer to peace than at this moment" ahead of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin holding talks on Ukraine on Tuesday

Trump says he and Putin will discuss "land", "power plants" and "dividing up certain assets", while the Kremlin confirms a call between the US and Russian leaders is being planned 

Sarah Rainsford analysis: US officials are trying to sound positive about doing a ceasefire deal - but the tone from Moscow is sounding extremely bullish

UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy says if Putin is serious about peace he must "prove it", adding he sees "no sign" the Russian president will agree to the ceasefire proposals

Meanwhile, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas says Russia "can't really be trusted" and the ball is in its court, following talks on Ukraine with member states in Brussels

Watch: President Trump tells reporters he will speak to Vladimir Putin

Edited by Johanna Chisholm

Civilians are continuing to be evacuated from the outskirts of Sudzha, a district in Russia's western Kursk region that was recently retaken by Moscow's armed forces.

According to the acting Kursk region governor, 371 people have been evacuated from "liberated settlements" - including 14 children - since 12 March.

As a reminder, Ukraine launched a military incursion in the Kursk region last August and captured some territory. 

However, Putin now claims Russia is fully back in control of Kursk, and Ukrainian troops are "isolated" - reports that Ukrainian officials have denied.

As we've been reporting, Ukrainian authorities have said Russian forces are continuing with their efforts to cross the border and invade Ukraine's northern Sumy region.

The Sumy region is across the border from Kursk, an area that Russian troops are currently retaking following Ukraine's mass incursion there in August last year.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had said that the Kursk operation had established a buffer zone which prevented Russian forces from being deployed in key areas of the front line in eastern Ukraine.

But Russia has steadily been taking territory back, and Ukrainian soldiers have been retreating.

Last week, Russian media reported that President Vladimir Putin visited the Kursk region for the first time since Ukraine's incursion.

We've recently been hearing from French President Emmanuel Macron, who says it's time to move toward a concrete peace plan "with all our partners".

"President Zelensky had the courage to accept the American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. Now it's up to Russia to prove that it truly wants peace.

"Enough deaths.
Enough lives destroyed.
Enough destruction.

The guns must fall silent," Macron says in a post on X.

He adds that the "abuses and sabotage must stop" and that deported Ukrainian children must be reunited with their families - conditions he says  Russia must fulfil. 

Donald Trump is committed to the plan, Macron says, highlighting how this was something he talked to the US president about when the pair spoke yesterday.

Macron also stresses the need for "solid security guarantees for Ukraine" and a secure lasting peace in Ukraine and Europe. 

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

Responding to another question - this one about Trump's claims that Ukraine-Russia discussions have so far revolved around dividing "assets" - Leavitt says that Kyiv's government and President Zelensky have both been "engaged". 

She refuses to give more details, however, saying that it would be "unwise" to "get ahead" of Trump's call with Putin tomorrow.

Leavitt also criticises the Biden administration as "the reason this war began" - a common claim made by Trump and his administration.

Trump, she says, has "made progress" in the ceasefire negotiation. 

"Hopefully tomorrow that progress continues," she adds, before the press briefing ends.

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

Here in the White House briefing room, it's a particularly heavy news day, with questions about Ukraine and Russia few and far between so far. 

With regards to a potential ceasefire negotiation, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt again says that Trump and Putin will talk tomorrow. 

"We've never been closer to peace than at this moment," Leavitt says. "The president is determined." 

Much of this news briefing, however, has focused on US immigration issues and other domestic matters.

A bit earlier today, Russia's Ministry of Defence released a statement saying a village in the Zaporizhzhia region had been "liberated" by its military.

The Ukrainian military is now denying the claims that Moscow's troops captured Stepove, a village in
southeastern Zaporizhzhia region.

 “They're part of the information war, which seeks to boost
their fighting spirit,” says Vladyslav Voloshyn, a spokesman for the Ukrainian
Operational Command South. He has told Ukrainian Suspilne TV that the
Ukrainian army has not lost any ground in the area over the past two days.

Ruslan Mykula from Deep State, a Ukrainian volunteer project
tracking changes in the frontline, also says that Stepove is still under
Ukrainian control.

“The occupiers have made several attempts to enter and stay
in Stepove, but Ukrainian artillery is very active there,” he tells Suspilne.

More from the UK's Foreign Secretary David Lammy who has told
the House of Commons that he doesn't see any sign Vladimir Putin will agree to
the ceasefire proposals. 

But he says a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Canada last
week helped "ready the tools to get Russia to negotiate seriously".

"We're not waiting for the Kremlin. If they reject a
ceasefire, we have more cards we can play," he says before discussing
economic sanctions on Moscow, targeting energy and defence sectors, squeezing
oil revenues and freezing foreign Russian assets.

We can now bring you the latest comments from the UK's Foreign
Secretary David Lammy in the House of Commons. 

Lammy says Vladimir Putin now "stands in the
spotlight" and "must answer" after the US and Ukraine agreed to
a ceasefire deal last week.

"Are you serious, Mr Putin, about peace?” he asks the House,
“will you stop fighting or will you drag your feet?" before demanding:
"If you are serious, prove it, with a full and unconditional ceasefire
now."

Lammy says Ukraine is "serious about peace" before
accusing Russia of playing "lip service to a ceasefire while still
pummelling Ukraine".

Vitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC Monitoring

The BBC's US partner CBS News is reporting that the country is
withdrawing from the International Centre for
the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine, which
is investigating Russian leaders like Vladimir Putin over Moscow's invasion. 

Commenting on those reports, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov
said:

“The US is gradually cutting unnecessary functions; this means
that they think it's an unnecessary function.”

Former Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Alina Frolova, says
she does not expect "so much success" during tomorrow's talks between
US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

"My feeling is that Putin is still the master of
withdrawing, postponing," she says.

Frolova adds that the Ukrainian and European position on ongoing
peace negotiations is important. "You can't make a deal without Ukraine
accepting it," she says.

"I don't think America can prevail absolutely in these
negotiations," Frolova says, adding that the US understands it needs
"Ukraine and Europe on board".



Russia's Ministry of Defence has just released a statement on
its Telegram channel with an update on its military "progress" in
Ukraine.

It says the village of Stepove in the Zaporizhzhia region has
been "liberated" by units of the Dnepr military group.

It also says it has defeated Ukrainian forces in the settlements
of Tyaginka in the Kherson region and Pavlovka, also in the Zaporizhzhia
region.

The BBC cannot independently verify these claims.

Vitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC Monitoring

The phone conversation between the Russian and US
presidents, which is expected to take place tomorrow, is “an important step
which sets the tone for reviving relations between the two countries,” Russia's official
news agency RIA Novosti has quoted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying.

There are no indications as to when they may meet in
person, he adds.

The chair of the foreign affairs committee in the Ukrainian
parliament, Oleksandr Merezhko, says the country has limits on how far it would
go to accept peace with Russia.

"We have three very firm red lines when it comes to
Ukraine," he tells the BBC, listing these as:



Merezkho goes on to say that he doesn't know what President Trump
expects from Russian leader Vladimir Putin, but adds "Putin has proved many
times he's a pathological liar and manipulator".

Trump and Putin are expected to hold talks tomorrow. Ukraine has
agreed to a 30-day ceasefire plan initiated by the US. Russia has said it
supports the idea but added that there are "nuances" to be worked
out.

Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump meeting face-to-face at the G20 leaders summit in 2019, during the US president's first term

Ahead of the talks between Presidents Putin and Trump, the
topics for discussion are being prepared, a Kremlin spokesperson says. 

Dmitry Peskov says the agenda includes the visit from US envoy
Steve Witkoff and various negotiations that have already happened, Russian news
agency Tass reports.

Peskov adds: "Those issues that are on the agenda, but
mainly, of course, issues of Ukrainian regulation. These are the themes that
will be prepared for the president."

The US president previously promised to end the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours of taking office

One week since the US and Ukraine announced their support for a 30-day ceasefire proposal, let's look at where the key players stand:

Trump: “A very good chance” the war could end

Although Russia is yet to agree to the ceasefire proposal, US
President Donald Trump insisted there is a “very good chance” the war
could end.

Addressing reporters, the US leader said he will speak with
Putin on Tuesday to discuss the peace proposals – as well as “land” and “power
plants” - and may have "something to announce".

Putin: “We support it but there are questions”

Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed support for the idea
of a ceasefire last week but set out several conditions for it to happen.

Those conditions include addressing “the root of this crisis,”
Putin said, mentioning the future of Russia's western Kursk region, as well as
details on who will enforce the ceasefire and how.

Zelensky: Putin is trying to “sabotage” peace

Responding to Putin's conditions for a ceasefire, Ukrainian
leader Volodymyr Zelensky accused Putin of trying to “sabotage” diplomatic
efforts by setting "unacceptable conditions right from the start".

In a post on social media, he also urged the US to put more
pressure on Russia and said only the "strength of America" could end
the war.

Lithuanian prosecutors have said Russia's military
intelligence agency, the GRU, is linked to arson attacks last spring
on shopping centres in
Vilnius and Warsaw. 

Two teenagers have been charged
with the attack in Lithuania, accused of planting an explosive device in an
Ikea store just before closing. 

In Warsaw, a huge shopping mall – Marywilska –
was burned to the ground.  

The news from Lithuanian
prosecutors has been used by
Poland's Prime Minister to remind others about what kind of Russia they
are dealing with ahead of any peace talks over Ukraine. 

As Donald Tusk points out, Russia hasn't only launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour, it is prosecuting a widespread hybrid war all over Europe. 

Writing on X he said: “Good to know [this] before negotiations.
Such is the nature of this state”.  

The two accused by Lithuania are Ukrainian nationals, fitting a pattern
for a series of sabotage and arson attacks across eastern Europe. 

Last month, a
Ukrainian citizen was found guilty of attempting to set fire to a paint factory
in Wroclaw, in western Poland – again, accused of working for Russian
intelligence. 

Poland closed the Russian consulate in Poznań in response to the
case.

More now from the news conference in Brussels with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. 

Asked how the EU will be involved in the ongoing negotiations on the war in Ukraine, Kallas says the bloc is "discussing matters with different interlocutors".

She describes the continuing peace talks as "shuttle diplomacy", saying "there's no negotiation table".

There's no negotiation table yet because Russia is not coming to the negotiation table."

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas

We've just heard from Kaja Kallas, the European Union's foreign
policy chief, following a morning meeting of the bloc's Foreign Affairs
Council.

Speaking at a news conference, Kallas says the council had an
"intensive" meeting that covered a wide range of topics, saying there
was "broad political support" for a defence initiative totalling  €40bn (£34bn).

On the peace talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Saudi
Arabia that led to a 30-day ceasefire proposal, she says everyone welcomed the
results of the talks and reiterates that the "ball is in Russia's
court".

"The understanding around the table is that Russia can't
really be trusted," she adds. "They will seize this opportunity to
present all kinds of demands."

Ukraine and Russia continued to exchange drone strikes
overnight, according to officials from both countries.

Ukrainian police said that a local resident was killed after a
drone targeted his car in the front-line town of Myrnohrad, in the eastern
Donetsk region.

And Ukraine's state-owned electricity operator Ukrenergo
reported that several regions across the country have been left without power
due to Russian drone attacks.

Below are the latest images coming through from Ukrainian
authorities.

Three children have been injured in Russian shelling of the
Ukrainian frontline town of Pokrovsk this morning, local authorities report.

Vadym Filashkin, the head of the Donetsk regional
administration, says in a Facebook post that
the children - two girls aged eight and 15, and a 12-year-old boy - had previously
been evacuated to a safer region of Ukraine, but their parents later “made the
crazy decision to return to Pokrovsk".

“Grown-ups who make their children sit under shelling in
frontline towns are infuriating. If you don't care about yourselves, at least
take care of your children! Don't wait for shells or bombs to hit your home!
Evacuate!” Filashkin says.

Pokrovsk is a key logistics hub in
Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, which Russians have been trying to capture
for many months.

The Trump administration has transferred hundreds of immigrants to El Salvador even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations under an 18th century wartime declaration targeting Venezuelan gang members, officials said Sunday. Flights were in the air at the time of the ruling.

U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg issued an order Saturday temporarily blocking the deportations, but lawyers told him there were already two planes with immigrants in the air — one headed for El Salvador, the other for Honduras. Boasberg verbally ordered the planes be turned around, but they apparently were not and he did not include the directive in his written order.

Boasberg scheduled a 4 p.m. ET hearing on Monday and said the government should be prepared to answer a series of questions about the flights laid out in the motion from plaintiffs, which include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the nonprofit group Democracy Forward.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement Sunday, responded to speculation about whether the administration was flouting court orders: "The administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order. The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory."

The acronym refers to the Tren de Aragua gang, which Trump targeted in his unusual proclamation that was released Saturday

In a court filing Sunday, the Department of Justice, which has appealed Boasberg's decision, said it would not use the Trump proclamation he blocked for further deportations if his decision is not overturned.

Trump's allies were gleeful over the results.

"Oopsie — Too late," Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who agreed to house about 300 immigrants for a year at a cost of $6 million US in his country's prisons, wrote on the social media site X above an article about Boasberg's ruling. That post was recirculated by White House communications director Steven Cheung.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who negotiated an earlier deal with Bukele to house immigrants, posted on the site: "We sent over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars."

The deportees were taken to the notorious CECOT facility, the centrepiece of Bukele's push to pacify his once violence-wracked country through tough police measures and limits on basic rights.

Trump moves quickly on immigration raids, arrests

The immigrants were deported after Trump's declaration of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which has been used only three times in U.S. history.

The law, invoked during the War of 1812 and World Wars I and II, requires a president to declare the United States is at war, giving him extraordinary powers to detain or remove foreigners who otherwise would have protections under immigration or criminal laws. It was last used to justify the detention of Japanese-American civilians during World War II.

Venezuela's government in a statement Sunday rejected the use of Trump's declaration of the law, characterizing it as evocative of "the darkest episodes in human history, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps."

Tren de Aragua originated in an infamously lawless prison in the central state of Aragua and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone during the past decade. Trump seized on the gang during his campaign to paint misleading pictures of communities that he contended were "taken over" by what were actually a handful of lawbreakers.

The Trump administration has not identified the immigrants deported, provided any evidence they are in fact members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crimes in the United States. It also sent two top members of the Salvadoran MS-13 gang to El Salvador who had been arrested in the United States.

Boasberg noted that the Alien Enemies Act has never before been used outside of a congressionally declared war and that plaintiffs may successfully argue Trump exceeded his legal authority in invoking it.

The bar on deportations stands for up to 14 days and the immigrants will remain in federal custody during that time. Boasberg has scheduled a hearing Friday to hear additional arguments in the case.

He said he had to act because the immigrants whose deportations may actually violate the U.S. Constitution deserved a chance to have their pleas heard in court.

"Once they're out of the country," Boasberg said, "there's little I could do."

Concerns have also been raised in other cases about whether the Trump administration is complying with court rulings.

Dr. Rasha Alawieh, 34, who is an assistant professor at Brown University's medical school in Providence, R.I., has been deported to Lebanon even though a judge had issued an order blocking the U.S. visa holder's immediate removal from the country, according to court papers.

U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, said he had received a "detailed and specific" timeline of the events from a lawyer working on Alawieh's behalf that raised "serious allegations" about whether his order was violated.

Despite the judge's order, according to the cousin's lawyers, Alawieh was flown to Paris, where she was then set to board a flight for Lebanon that had been scheduled for Sunday.

Alawieh, a Lebanese citizen who lives in Providence, R.I., was detained on Thursday after arriving at Logan International Airport in Boston after travelling to Lebanon to see relatives, according to a lawsuit filed by her cousin, Yara Chehab.

Alawieh has held visas to be in the United States since 2018, when she first came to complete a two-year fellowship at Ohio State University before then completing a fellowship at the University of Washington and then moving to the Yale-Waterbury Internal Medicine Program, which she completed in June.

Lawyers for the government explained in a court filing Monday that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at Logan did not receive notice of the order until she "had already departed the United States," the judge noted. They asked that the petition be dismissed.

Sorokin put a hearing on her case on hold to give Alawieh's new lawyers time to prepare.

The protest in Belgrade, Serbia, was the culmination of four months of rallies against President Aleksandar Vucic's government after a deadly train station roof collapse.

Tens of thousands of protesters filled the streets of Serbia's capital over the weekend, the culmination of more than four months of demonstrations against the government of President Aleksandar Vucic and what they see as its slow response to a deadly train station collapse in November. The protest movement is a major challenge to Vucic, who has dominated the political sphere for about a dozen years. Here's what to know.

Anti-government protests initially began in response to the train station collapse, with protesters displaying a red-stained hand as a symbol of their belief in the government's culpability.

But they have since evolved into a “nationwide wave against government malpractice, systemic corruption, and weak institutional oversight,” said Strahinja Subotic, who took part in Saturday's protests and works as a senior researcher at the European Policy Center think tank.

Protesters have blamed the deadly collapse on what they said were shady ties between local politicians and contractors that resulted in a shoddy renovation of the station. In the aftermath, Transport Minister Goran Vesic resigned, and the public prosecutor's office later indicted him and 12 other people on public-safety-related charges and irregular execution of construction work. But the protests continued, as critics pushed for investigators to add corruption charges.

In January, Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned alongside his government, saying he did not want to “further raise tensions in society.” But Vucevic's resignation “has not resolved the underlying crisis,” Subotic said in an email, and public frustration with Vucic has grown.

Saturday's rally undoubtedly represented “the largest protest in Serbian history and the most significant challenge to the ruling regime” in 12 years, Subotic said.

Although the protest movement has been informally led by students, it has grown to include other sectors of society, and “a lot of people are supporting them,” said Engjellushe Morina, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank.

While most of the protests that have taken place in the past four months have been peaceful, there were some clashes between protesters and pro-government agitators. In January, during a memorial in Belgrade for the victims of the Novi Sad disaster, a man rammed his car into a student. The public prosecutor's office said it would charge the man, whom it identified only by the initials M.P., with aggravated attempted murder, according to the publication Balkan Insight. A similar incident took place in November in the town of Pozarevac, the publication reported. Dozens of individuals have also been arrested during protests.

Morina said the government's response to these incidents — particularly comments made by Vucic that seemingly downplayed the crash in Pozarevac — has further angered the protesters. “This annoys people because … they can sense that he's not serious about these changes,” she said.

Student organizers of the protests have issued several demands: They want the government to publish all the documents relating to its investigation into the renovation of the Novi Sad train station, which was led by Chinese constructors, and prosecute anyone involved. They have also demanded the arrest of anyone involved in attacking protesters and that any protesters who were arrested be pardoned. And they asked for an increase to the state's education budget.

The government has acted on many of these demands. Vucic in January pardoned 13 protesters, and the public prosecutor's office said it had opened criminal proceedings against 41 people for attacks against protesters. The prosecutor's office also published documents relating to the Novi Sad investigation. And in February the government adopted a proposal to amend the nation's higher education law to provide teachers with higher salaries, reduce some students' tuition and give universities more funding and independence from government.

But Morina said the government's concessions have not put an end to the protests because “people have lost trust that [Vucic] can deliver.”

“What Vucic is doing right now is being seen as patching things up, not seriously addressing the concerns,” she said.

“At the heart of the situation lies a deep atmosphere of distrust, particularly as the ruling regime continues to attempt to [delegitimize] both the protesters and their demands,” Subotic said.

Even as the Vucic government has met some of the protesters' demands, it has suggested without providing evidence that the protest movement is funded by foreign powers to destabilize Serbia.

Earlier this month, Donald Trump Jr. visited Serbia and interviewed Vucic, who called the protest movement an “imported revolution.”

Vucic last month cited Trump's criticism of USAID — which his administration has mostly dismantled and accused of political bias and wasteful spending — in justifying raids on at least four nonprofits in Serbia that he claimed received funds from USAID and were involved in the protests. The move prompted alarm from civil society groups, which said it was an attempt by the government to silence and scare critics.

U.S. immigration authorities arrested and interrogated a German national who is a legal permanent U.S. resident at Boston Logan International Airport on March 7, according to the man's mother and his partner. Three days later, law enforcement officers took him to a hospital before he was transferred to a federal detention facility.

Fabian Schmidt, 34, is now being held at the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls, Rhode Island, according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement online database. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In an emailed statement Monday, an assistant commissioner of public affairs at U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said: “If statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.”

“Due to federal privacy regulations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection cannot disclose details about specific cases,” said the assistant commissioner, Hilton Beckham.

Astrid Senior, Schmidt's mother, said in a phone interview Monday that her son contacted her March 11, four days after he was scheduled to land in Boston. She said that she and her son moved to the U.S. from Germany in 2007 and received green cards in 2008. He lives in New Hampshire and renewed his legal permanent resident status last year, she said.

Senior said she has no idea why her son is being detained by U.S. immigration officials. She said her son, who once lived in California, faced misdemeanor charges roughly a decade ago. He has no active legal or court issues, Senior said. 

“I feel helpless. Absolutely helpless,” Senior said.

Senior and Schmidt's partner, Bhavani Hodgkins, confirmed the family has retained a lawyer to work on his case. The lawyer, David Keller, did not immediately respond to an email and text message requesting more information Monday.

In recent weeks, President Donald Trump's administration has ramped up border enforcement and moved to tighten immigration policies. Schmidt's case raises questions about how federal immigration officials will treat people who are permanent legal residents.

The news of Schmidt's arrest and detention was first reported by GBH, a Boston area public television station.

Senior, who also lives in New Hampshire, said Schmidt called her from the ICE facility on March 11 and provided his account of events leading up to his detention. She said she has not heard from him since.

Schmidt, an electrical engineer, recently traveled to Germany for seven days to visit family and flew into Boston Logan from Luxembourg on March 7, Senior said.

Hodgkins was supposed to pick him up and drive him back to the home in Nashua they share with their child, who is a U.S. citizen. Hodgkins called the authorities when he did not appear after several hours, Senior said.

Senior said Schmidt told her that he was interrogated at the airport, though she declined to provide specifics. He required medical attention at some point during the interrogation and he was taken  to Massachusetts General Hospital, Senior said.

Benjamin Crawley, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Port Authority, which owns and operates Boston Logan, said in an email: “We don't have any information on this case.” He referred NBC News to CBP.

In an emailed statement, Sgt. Gregory Jones of the Massachusetts State Police said authorities dispatched a trooper to a medical call at the customs hall in Boston Logan's Terminal E shortly before 8 a.m. on March 10.

“Boston EMS also responded and determined that the individual required transport to a local hospital,” Jones said. CBP personnel “accompanied the individual to the hospital as they were not able to process the individual through customers prior to the transport.” 

Mass General's press office did not immediately respond to an email seeking information about Schmidt.

In an email, a German official at the German embassy in Washington, D.C., said it was “aware of the case and has been in close contact about it with the relevant U.S. authorities as well as the family of the concerned person.”

“We kindly ask for your understanding that for reasons of privacy and data protection laws, we cannot provide any further details on the case," the official said. "Considering the procedures of the Customs and Border authorities, please refer to the relevant U.S. authorities."

A French politician says the United States should return New York City's iconic Statue of Liberty, which was gifted by France 138 years ago.

The statue, which was given to the U.S. on the 100th anniversary of its independence, has long been a defining feature of the New York City skyline and an emblem of the free world.

At a party convention for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, Raphael Glucksmann, a member of European Parliament, told his colleagues that America should return the gift as the country no longer embodies or protects the values of democracy and freedom.

“We're going to say to the Americans who have chosen to side with the tyrants, to the Americans who fired researchers for demanding scientific freedom, give us back the Statue of Liberty,” he said, according to media reports.

“We gave it to you as a gift, but apparently you despise it. So it will be just fine here at home.”

At a White House press briefing on Monday, when asked if the U.S. government would return the statue, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed the French politician's comments off, saying that the U.S. will “absolutely not” be returning it.

“My advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now. So they should be very grateful to our great country,” she told reporters.

Glucksmann's comments come amid a flurry of protests against the Trump administration both domestically and from the international community.

In Canada, American flags flown outside government buildings, schools and sports arenas are being taken down.

Over the weekend, flags flying in Mississauga, Ont., were removed following Mayor Carolyn Parrish's approval.

“At the request of many, the City has begun to remove all American flags from sports arenas and locations along Lake Ontario, including the pier at Snug Harbour in Port Credit. Oversized Canadian flags (15'x30') are ordered and will be installed on all the poles at City Hall,” she wrote on X.

The City of Barrie, Ont., has also taken down American flags.

Meanwhile, Canadians are reducing travel south of the border and are opting to buy domestically produced products.

According to a recent survey by Canadian market researcher Leger, 59 per cent said they are less likely to visit the U.S. in 2025 than in 2024, and two-thirds of Canadians have minimized their purchasing of American goods both in-store and online.

Canadian sports fans have been drowning out The Star-Spangled Banner at professional events between American and Canadian teams, a phenomenon that former prime minister Justin Trudeau said would likely continue during an address to the nation and Trump in February.

In the U.S. an audience at the Kennedy Center booed vice-president JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, as they took their seats ahead of a classical concert last weekend.

The vice-president was also met by demonstrators during a ski trip to Vermont last month, following his and Trump's dressing down of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office.

President Donald Trump will visit the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Monday afternoon

Trump Will Visit the Kennedy Center as He Puts His Mark on the National Arts Institution

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday will visit the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where he'll take a tour and attend a board meeting.

It will be his first time at the venerable institution since he began remaking it at the start of his second term in office. 

Trump fired the previous board of the Kennedy Center, writing on social media that they “do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.” He replaced them with loyalists and made himself chairman. 

The Republican president's allies have complained that the Kennedy Center, which is known for its annual celebration of notable American artists, had become too liberal and “woke” with its programming. 

“We have to straighten it out. It's not a good situation," Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday evening. 

The Kennedy Center, which sits on the banks of the Potomac River, opened in 1971 and has enjoyed bipartisan support over the years. 

However, Trump has a fraught relationship with it, dating to his first term as president. He skipped the annual honors ceremony each year, breaking with tradition.

            Lebanon says it was struck by shelling from Syria, after three Syrians were killed in Lebanon, escalating tensions between Beirut and Syria's new Islamist-led government.
    


            Lebanese villages on the border with Syria were subjected to shelling after three Syrians died in the northern Lebanese town of Qasr, the Lebanese military said on Monday, adding that its forces responded to the attack.
    


            “Contacts continue between the army command and the Syrian authorities to maintain security and stability in the border area,” it said. The Syrian shelling also targeted Qasr, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said.
    


            On Sunday, Syria's defense ministry accused the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah of kidnapping three Syrian troops from Syrian territory in an ambush, the state news agency SANA reported, saying they were “taken to Lebanese territory and executed on the spot.”

            It also said that a photographer and reporter were injured on the Syria-Lebanon border after being struck by a “Hezbollah missile.”
    


            The Syrian defense ministry will take “all necessary measures following this dangerous escalation by Hezbollah,” SANA said.
    


            The Lebanese army said that two Syrians were killed at the border and another died in hospital, and that the three bodies were handed over to Syria.
    


Hezbollah denied involvement in the border clashes, the Lebanese state news agency NNA reported, saying it “has no connection to any events taking place within Syrian territory.”
    


            In response, Lebanon's presidency said Monday that tensions on the country's frontier with Syria “cannot go on.”
    


            “What is happening on the eastern and northeastern borders cannot go on, and we will not accept its continuation,” the presidency said on X, adding that President Joseph Aoun has instructed the military to respond “to the source of fire.”
    


            If confirmed to have been conducted by Syria, the attack on Lebanon would mark rare action by Syria's new government on one of its neighbors. The country's leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has repeatedly said he wants to maintain stability with Syria's neighbors and has so far refrained from responding to repeated Israeli strikes on his country.
    


            The clashes are a sign of growing tensions at the Lebanon-Syria border, northeast of the Beqaa valley, where predominantly Shiite Lebanese villages have seen skirmishes with Syrian soldiers in recent weeks.
    


            Syria's new government is led by former Sunni-Islamist militants who ousted the regime of Iran-allied Bashar al-Assad late last year. Shiite Hezbollah had intervened in Syria during the country's civil war to help Assad fight the Sunni militants.

The County Kerry town of Dingle boasted one of Ireland's “earliest” St Patrick's Day parades, which kicked off at 6 am local time on Monday, March 17.

Footage from politician Michael Healy-Rae shows Dingle's fife and drum band marching through the town before the sun had risen on Monday morning.

According to national news reports, the tradition stems from restrictions banning gatherings between sunrise and sunset imposed by British authorities in the 1870s.

Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 40 people across six states. 

The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Forecasters assigned an unusual "high risk" designation to the system, which was also blamed for icy winter weather in northern parts of the country and severe thunderstorms, including on the West Coast, on Sunday.

In all, extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south.

Heavy thunderstorms in the forecast for Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, prompted schedule changes for the 2025 Players Championship, CBS Sports reported. The tournament moved up tee times Sunday and grouped golfers together to ensure the last 18 holes would be completed before the evening.

In Kansas, at least eight people died and numerous injuries were reported Friday after more than 55 vehicles were involved in a crash due to a dust storm.  

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves reported six deaths across three counties as multiple tornadoes swept through the state. At least three others had been missing, but were all found as of Sunday evening. Reeves said. At least 27 people were injured across the state and some 217 people were displaced by the storms. A peak of about 36,000 customers had lost power, but by Sunday evening that was down to a little under 8,000, Reeves said. 

Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12, authorities said. The deaths included a man whose home was ripped apart by a tornado.

"It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field," said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. "The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls."

Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt's house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri.

"It was a very rough deal last night," Henderson said Saturday, not far from the splintered home from which he said they rescued his aunt through a window of the only room left standing. "It's really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night."

Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe said that first responders, volunteers and faith-based partners "worked tirelessly" through the night "in response to a series of devastating tornadoes and severe storms, and before that, dangerous and damaging fires." 

In Oklahoma, the governor said one person died on the road, presumably due to smoke. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner later confirmed at least four people had died in the state as a result of fires or high winds.

In Arkansas, officials reported three fatalities in Independence County, and 29 people were reported injured in eight counties in connection to a storm system that moved through the state overnight. Staff from the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) have been called to the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) due to extensive storm damage across the state. 

The National Weather Service on Sunday noted at least two areas in the state where "damage consistent with EF-4 tornado damage" was seen.

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Saturday that she spoke with President Trump after Friday night's tornados in the state. 

"[Trump] said to tell the people of Arkansas he loves them and he and his administration are here to help with whatever we need following last night's tornadoes," she said in a post on X.

Mr. Trump on Sunday announced on social media the National Guard had been deployed to Arkansas.

Further south in Texas, officials said four people died after weather-related fatalities, some during car crashes in the midst of a dust storm.

"It's the worst I've ever seen," said Sgt. Cindy Barkley of the state's department of public safety, calling the near-zero visibility a nightmare. "We couldn't tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled."

Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers.

"This is terrible out here," said Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48-foot trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. "There's a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I'm not pushing it over 55 mph. I'm scared it will blow over if I do."

The severe storm front sparked tornadoes in Alabama as it moved eastward, killing at least three people. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said Sunday that one of the deaths was confirmed in Plantersville and another in Winterboro, both in the state's central region. 

Earlier, the weather service issued multiple tornado warnings across Alabama, advising residents to seek shelter Saturday night. In the east Alabama community of Elrod, a CBS News spotter reported that a possible tornado had uprooted trees and damaged at least one home. 

And in Sipsey, Alabama, north of Birmingham, a 911 call center told CBS News that a suspected tornado had caused possible injuries and damaged several homes.

At one point, weather service employees at the agency's Birmingham office were forced to abandon operations and take shelter themselves. 

"We're back. Much thanks to @NWSAtlanta for the help!" NWS Birmingham wrote on social media. 

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has declared an emergency in anticipation of the storm's continued shift eastward. Early Sunday morning, the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency used its social media accounts to repost a National Weather Service tornado watch for parts of southeast Georgia. The watch warned of isolated tornadoes, hail and wind gusts of 50 to 70 miles per hour.

On the East Coast, heavy rain could bring flash flooding to some areas on Sunday. 

Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.

"What's unique about this one is its large size and intensity," said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. "And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area."

The Storm Prediction Center uses five categories to warn of expected severe weather, ranging from marginal to high. Its forecast maps are color-coded, with the lowest risk areas in green and the highest shown in magenta.

On Saturday, the area of highest risk included parts of Mississippi and Alabama.

The "high risk" designation is used when severe weather is expected to include "numerous intense and long-tracked tornadoes" or thunderstorms producing hurricane-force wind gusts and inflicting widespread damage, according to the agency's product descriptions.

On many days when the "high risk" designation was used in recent years, the forecasts became reality.

The weather service said at least five tornadoes were reported in Missouri on Friday, including one in the St. Louis area. Several buildings were damaged in the storm, including a strip mall in Rolla, Missouri, where a tornado was reported Friday afternoon.

The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible.

"Potentially violent" tornadoes were expected Saturday in parts of the central Gulf Coast and Deep South into the Tennessee Valley, according to the National Weather Service.

The Storm Prediction Center said parts of Mississippi, including Jackson and Hattiesburg, and areas of Alabama, including Birmingham and Tuscaloosa, were at a high risk. Severe storms and tornadoes were also possible across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle.

Wildfires in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds, and evacuations were ordered Friday for some communities in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico.

A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile to an estimated 32.8 square miles, the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles before its advance was halted in the afternoon. 

In Oklahoma, the National Weather Service said a "complex of extremely dangerous fires" was located northeast of Oklahoma City, near Stillwater, and urged some people in the city of about 50,000 to evacuate on Friday evening. Officials issued mandatory evacuation orders via social media that included homes, hotels and a Walmart.

Overall, nearly 150 fires were reported in Oklahoma, Andy James, the state's Forestry Services fire management chief, told local media. The State Patrol said on social media that winds toppled several tractor-trailers. 

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said that 70,000 acres had burned in the state. About 293 homes and structures had been destroyed as of Saturday afternoon — including Stitt's own farmhouse, he said. 

Firefighters had been prepositioned in certain areas, which helps authorities jump on blazes early, James said. Firefighting aircraft were also deployed in some parts of Oklahoma and Texas but were generally unable to fly due to low visibility from smoke and dust, he added.

Officials urged people in some areas of central Missouri's Camden County to evacuate due to wildfires, and the State Highway Patrol warned via social media that they were nearing homes and businesses.

Roughly 120 miles of Interstate 70 in western Kansas were temporarily shut down due to blowing dust and limited visibility.

High winds also knocked out power to more than 250,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Mississippi, according to the website poweroutage.us.

The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches were expected, with up to a foot possible.

Winds gusting to 60 mph were expected to cause whiteout conditions.

Canada wants to “maintain the most positive possible” relationship with the United States, Prime Minister Mark Carney said as he kicked off his first international trip since taking office.

Carney was in France, where he meet with French President Emmanuel Macron before leaving for the United Kingdom later on Monday.

In joint opening remarks before their meeting in Paris, Carney stressed that Canada and France shared values of sovereignty, solidarity and sustainability and must strengthen their ties.

“With you Mr. President, I want to ensure that France and the whole of Europe works enthusiastically with Canada, the most European of non-European countries, determined, like you, to maintain the most positive possible relations with the United States,” Carney said in English.

“Canada is a reliable, trustworthy, and strong partner of France, which shares our values and lives them through action during this age of economic and geopolitical crises.”

Carney also said Canada and France know that economic co-operation, not confrontation, will help build strong economies.

This was Carney's first in-person meeting with an international leader as prime minister.

Macron called Canada a “unique friend” with a shared vision of freedom. He also underscored a deep strategic partnership for trade, defence, protecting the environment and creating new technologies.

“We believe that fair trade that respects international rules is a good thing for everyone's prosperity and it is far more effective than tariffs that simply create inflation and destroy the integration of our economies and our supply chain,” he said.

Carney's Europe trip comes just days after he was sworn in as Canada's prime minister Friday.

Later on Monday, Carney arrived in London, where he had a private audience with King Charles III at Buckingham Palace.

The Royal Family's X account shared a photo of the King with Carney, but did not mention what was discussed at the audience.

Carney will also meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer before travelling to Canada's north on Tuesday.

The meetings are taking place amid global trade uncertainty as U.S. President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs on America's allies, including Canada and European nations, with more threatened to come.

Carney said on Friday that he currently has no plans to go to the U.S., but he looks forward to speaking to Trump at the “appropriate moment.”

On Sunday, Carney spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which he “reaffirmed Canada's steadfast support for Ukraine” in its fight against Russia's invasion, according to a statement from the Prime Minister's Office.

Carney also formally invited Zelenskyy to the G7 Summit that will take place in Alberta in June.

"Uncommon is Calling" reveals meaningful opportunities for prospective Soldiers to serve their communities

WASHINGTON, March 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The U.S. Army announced a new marketing campaign exclusively focused on opportunities in the Army National Guard. "Uncommon is Calling" challenges young people to reimagine the potential of part-time service by comparing Soldiers' everyday lives to the uncommon experiences they gain as part of the Army National Guard. 

New U.S. Army National Guard campaign spotlights extraordinary impact of part-time service

With a presence in 54 states and territories, the Army National Guard is a unique component of the U.S. Army where Soldiers support communities in their home state by responding to domestic emergencies and at the federal level as standby support for Active Duty Soldiers. Army National Guard Soldiers have the flexibility to serve part-time across medical, aviation, law enforcement, transportation, and engineering fields and beyond, while also pursuing their personal and professional goals through a civilian career or higher education. 

"Many young people are unaware that they can serve in the Army part-time," says Brig. Gen. Antoinette Gant, Chief of Army Enterprise Marketing. "To bridge this gap, 'Uncommon is Calling' offers youth a new perspective on Army service by presenting the experiences, flexibility, and local impact that can only be achieved as part of the Army National Guard."

The campaign delivers five films featuring real Soldiers in emergency scenarios based on the missions that the Army National Guard completes every year. Each one provides an up-close and personal view of Soldiers as uncommon experiences unfold through their eyes:

Influenced by youth brands and street posters, the films' black-and-white visuals and distinct typography aim to appeal to this new generation of prospective Soldiers and showcase how the Army National Guard is distinct from other paths to military service. 

"The campaign represents just a few of the many ways Army National Guard Soldiers make an impact in their communities," says Gant. "By showing the variety of capabilities and extraordinary blend of skills National Guard Soldiers can gain through service, we are inspiring the next generation of Soldiers who seek exciting challenges, opportunities for growth, and a deep sense of purpose."

"Uncommon is Calling" will reach audiences across a variety of channels and distribution methods, including streaming platforms like MAX, CBS, and ESPN, and digital platforms like YouTube, Meta, Reddit, LinkedIn, and NationalGuard.com, with an emphasis on local and state-specific extensions to meet prospective Soldiers where they are.

Some MAGA followers are spreading an unsubstantiated theory related to the cost of the US national debt.

The US stock market has had a bumpy ride since United States President Donald Trump's election in November.

After hitting record highs in the aftermath of Trump's victory, US stocks have shed trillions of dollars amid his dizzying back-and-forth announcements on tariffs and growing fears of a recession.

While Trump has played down the turbulence as a temporary “period of transition” on the road to a stronger economy, supporters and critics of the US president alike have speculated without evidence that he may be trying to crash the stock market on purpose.

Trump's vacillating economic policies have created uncertainty – something investors famously dislike.

The benchmark S&P500, which tracks the performance of 500 of the biggest US firms, has lost nearly $5 trillion in value from its February 19 peak.

On March 10, the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 4 percent – its worst single-day drop since September 2022.

Regardless of whether Trump is playing the long game as he claims, the past month “stands out for both the amount of uncertainty and the variety of fronts”, Tara Sinclair, director of the George Washington University Center for Economic Research, told Al Jazeera.

The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis produces based on news coverage of economic policy-related issues, in February hit its highest level since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

The Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index in January reached its highest point on record apart from May 2020.

There are several unsubstantiated theories about why Trump might want to crash the stock market, but chief among them is that he is trying to make it easier to pay off the US's $36 trillion national debt by lowering interest rates.

Since taking office, Trump has both expressed concern about the size of the debt and called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.

In a recent interview with FOX News, he claimed that “nobody ever gets rich when the interest rates are high, because people can't borrow money.”

With a debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio of about 120 percent, the federal debt is approaching its highest level since the end of World War II.

It is also expensive to pay off – the US government last year spent more than $1 trillion on interest payments alone.

 



 

Some Trump supporters have claimed that he is intentionally trying to induce economic pain to force the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would make it cheaper to refinance the national debt.

“Trump is setting up a stock market crash. The US government needs to refinance $7 trillion in debt over the next 6 months,” crypto influencer and investor Thomas Kralow, who has more than 500,000 YouTube followers, said on X last week.

“Trump doesn't want this done at current 10-year yields. This is why he's letting the stock market drop while pushing bond prices higher,” Kralow said, adding this would create “short term pain, long term gain”.

While the Federal Reserve makes its decisions independent of the White House and US Congress, it typically lowers the cost of borrowing during difficult economic conditions in order to stimulate growth.

When interest rates go down, the government also pays out lower yields on US Treasury bonds – essentially a type of loan to the government – thereby reducing the cost of interest paid on outstanding debt.

If bond yields were to come down, the US government would be able to pay substantially lower interest payments on the debt that needs refinancing, which is expected to amount to some $9 trillion in 2025, according to an estimate by Axel Funhoff, a professor at the Antwerp Management School in Belgium.

“For the better part of a decade, the US benefitted from historically low interest rates. These lower rates enabled the government to finance its debt at rates around 2.7 percent,” Funhoff said in a LinkedIn post in January.

Compared with that era of cheap borrowing, current interest rates are much higher: The yields on 10-year Treasury bonds and 5-year Treasury bonds stood at 4.3 percent and 4 percent, respectively, on Friday.

 



 

A different theory circulating among some Trump critics suggests that he is deliberately tanking the stock market to reward himself and his supporters, including conservative Wall Street investors and MAGA-supporting Silicon Valley CEOs.

Proponents of this theory claim that Trump induced a market tumble so that he and his allies can “buy the dip” – in other words, buy stocks at a discount before the market bounces back.

“[Trump] is purposely manipulating the stock markets …. Tariff scare, markets go down his rich buddies buy the dip, afterwards tariff off, stock market goes back up, said rich friends get richer… He needs to be investigated,” X user AKASabraFella said last week.

While the Trump administration has played down the turmoil in the markets, it has not given any indication that it actually wants the stock prices to go down.

Indeed, Trump has in the past often boasted about the performance of stocks on his watch when the market has been bullish.

Kathleen Brooks, the founder of market analysis company Minerva Analysis, said she did not believe Trump was purposely trying to cause the market to drop.

“The US economy peaked in November and since then US economic data has been trending lower and surprisingly on the downside. This means that the bond market had to play catch-up,” Brooks told Al Jazeera, adding that other assets like Bitcoin have also fallen from their peak.

“It is not unusual for markets to move in unison like this. This undermines the view that the moves in the Treasury market are a conspiracy theory. Instead, there are good fundamental reasons for the decline,” she said.

Some market analysts have also suggested that the market is overvalued and long overdue a correction – Wall Street lingo for a drop of more than 10 percent from its peak.

Legendary investor Warren Buffett, whose market moves are closely watched due to his decades-long record of outperforming the S&P 500, dumped at least $134bn in stocks in 2024 in a sell-off that was widely interpreted as a signal that the market was running too hot.

Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire — a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year.

But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets or rising recession risks because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say. 

Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called "correction" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday.

The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say.

"First of all, you aren't alone — a lot of people are panicking," TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. "Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action." 

The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report.

"Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings," noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. "One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics." 

Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account. 

It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say. 

Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time. 

"How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically — all of that is completely valid to consider," TIAA's Ornstein said. 

But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment. 

"Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have" to manage that risk, he noted.

Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement. 

But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said.

"Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 — they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover" before they retire, he noted. "But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years."

He added, "We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change."

In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan. 

More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research has found.

Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said.

"Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up," he said. When markets head south, "It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments." 

For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries. 

And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund. 

Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.

"The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings," she said. "Now is the time to find out how to build that up."

A majority of American voters say their sympathies lie more with Ukraine than Russia in the war between the two countries. At the same time, nearly half say they think President Donald Trump favors Russia, while most of the remainder believe he favors neither, according to the new national NBC News poll.

Sixty-one percent of registered voters choose Ukraine when asked which of the two countries has their sympathies more, while just 2% say Russia. Another 35% say they are more sympathetic to neither side, while 2% are not sure.

When asked where they believe Trump's sympathies are, 49% choose Russia, 40% say they think Trump favors neither side, and 8% choose Ukraine. Another 3% say they are not sure.

Trump himself has publicly adopted the idea of not favoring either side, saying in February, “If I didn't align myself with both of them, you'd never have a deal.”

“I cannot recall a moment in history when American public opinion and voters' views of a president, as to which country they are more aligned with, have been more in conflict with each other,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey along with GOP pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.

Those whose personal sympathies lie more with Ukraine are more likely to be Democrats (88% of them chose Ukraine), independents (59%) and those with higher levels of education and income. But majorities across a handful of key demographic cross-sections — gender, age and race — all backed Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia in 2022. Hispanic voters are close to evenly divided between Ukraine and “neither side.” 

The key split is on political lines, with Republican and conservative-leaning voters more likely to say their sympathies lie with neither nation. Among Republicans, 57% say they favor neither side.

But there are some notable splits within the GOP. For example, 53% of college-educated Republicans say their sympathies lie more with Ukraine, while 62% of Republicans without a college degree say their sympathies lie with neither country.

On the question of how voters view Trump's positioning on Ukraine and Russia, majorities of Democrats, independents, suburban women, voters of color and voters across all age ranges (except ages 50-64) all believe Trump is more sympathetic to Russia.

Among Republicans, 70% say Trump is not more sympathetic to either nation. Another 14% say Trump is more sympathetic to Russia, and 13% say he's more sympathetic to Ukraine.

Trump's handling of the war between Ukraine and Russia has been one of the major storylines of the early months of his second term. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly pledged he would end the war quickly upon taking office, but the situation has proved to be more complicated as efforts to reach a ceasefire continue. And it's clear America's posture toward the two sides has changed in the new administration.

While then-President Joe Biden heaped praise on Ukraine for defending itself against Russia's incursion and repeatedly trumpeted new aid packages to the country, Trump has been more critical toward Ukraine, culminating in a heated confrontation between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in front of reporters in the Oval Office late last month.

During the discussion, Trump declared that Zelenskyy was “gambling with the lives of millions of people” and had been “disrespectful” to the U.S., while Vance argued the Ukrainian president hadn't been thankful enough for the help his country received. The episode scuttled plans to sign an agreement on mineral rights in Ukraine, and the Trump administration moved to pause intelligence sharing and aid to Ukraine in the days after the meeting, though both restarted last week after talks in Saudi Arabia.

These developments come amid a broader philosophical shift among Republicans toward Trump's brand of “America First” foreign policy, while Democrats have pulled in the opposite direction.

In the poll, voters heard two statements and picked which one better represents their thinking: The U.S. “need to focus here at home because America cannot be the world's policeman trying to solve all the problems and intervening in countries around the world,” or “America has not been strong enough and has allowed Russia and China to extend their influence and power throughout the world?”

In March 2022, Republicans were split: 47% chose focus here at home and 46% said America hasn't been strong enough on the international stage. 

Now, 61% want America to focus here at home while 33% say it hasn't been strong enough on the world stage. Democrats have moved in the opposite direction, from 49%-40% on focusing at home in 2022 to 57%-37% now that America hasn't been strong enough internationally.

Overall, 51% of American voters prefer to focus here at home and 43% say that America hasn't been strong enough on the world stage. That's similar to three years ago, when 50% said focus at home and 41% said America hasn't been strong enough on the world stage.

Republicans' evolution on U.S. foreign policy also includes increasingly negative views of NATO over the last few years. Trump has long criticized NATO countries for not spending enough to defend the alliance and said the U.S. has been unfairly shouldering the load.

In 2022, 39% of Republicans had a positive view of the military alliance among the U.S., Canada and 30 European countries, while 22% had a negative view of it. Now, 19% view NATO positively and 46% view it negatively.

Fifty-five percent of registered voters disapprove of Trump's handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, while 42% approve of it.

When asked to evaluate the kind of change Trump is bringing to America's handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, 41% of registered voters say Trump is bringing the right kind of change, 34% say he is bringing the wrong kind and 22% say he isn't bringing any change.

And U.S. voters give Ukraine and Zelenskyy far higher positive marks than Russian President Vladimir Putin and his country. Forty-six percent of voters say they view Zelenskyy favorably and 32% view him negatively, close to the 41% who view Ukraine positively and 28% who view the country negatively.

Just 6% view Russia positively and 68% view it negatively, while 3% view Putin positively and 84% view him negatively.

While Democratic views on Zelenskyy and Ukraine have largely stayed similar since NBC News polling measured them in May 2022, Republicans have less positive views of Zelenskyy and Ukraine than they did previously. Negative views of Russia and Putin have also declined among Republicans, though positive views have not moved appreciably.

A plurality of Republicans, 37%, viewed Ukraine negatively in November 2023, while 27% viewed the country positively. But the nation's lost support from the party since then, and now 46% view it negatively and 19% view it positively.

“The president is creating an alignment with his own political base,” said McInturff, the Republican pollster.

“You're watching a shift,” McInturff continued. “He is dragging his own political base in terms of his current rhetoric and position.”

The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Fox News correspondent Brooke Taylor reports on the busy holiday travel season on ‘Special Report.'

President Donald Trump on Sunday sent the National Guard to tornado-struck Arkansas after tornadoes and heavy winds ripped through multiple states over the weekend, leaving at least 37 dead.

Heavy winds tore through the Heartland on Saturday, threatening Missouri, Mississippi, Kansas, Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma with tornadoes, damaging buildings and homes. Northern states, including South Dakota and Minnesota, faced blizzard warnings.

"We are actively monitoring the severe tornadoes and storms that have impacted many States across the South and Midwest — 36 innocent lives have been lost, and many more devastated," Trump said in a Sunday post on X. 

"The National Guard have been deployed to Arkansas, and my Administration is ready to assist State and Local Officials, as they help their communities to try and recover from the damage. Please join Melania and me in praying for everyone impacted by these terrible storms!" the president wrote.

The National Guard tweeted that its Arkansas officers will "support civilian authorities providing security and humanitarian assistance in communities affected by tornadoes in central and eastern Arkansas."

Here are the number of deaths by state so far:

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said there were about 50 National Guardsmen and 40 state police on the ground in Arkansas on Sunday.

"As you drive through this community, you see so many neighbors coming out, taking care of each other," she said in a video posted to X. "One of the things that will make you so proud as a governor is to see neighbors helping neighbors, and never is that more true than right here in this community today. We've got about 40 state police on the ground in the county, about 50 National Guard."

In a post on X, Sanders said she spoke with Trump on the phone, who "said to tell the people of Arkansas he loves them and he and his administration are here to help with whatever we need following last night's tornadoes."

Missouri resident Dakota Henderson told The Associated Press that he and some others helped rescue neighbors trapped beneath rubble on Friday evening and found five bodies in the process.

"It's really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night," Henderson told AP on Saturday.

Evacuations were ordered Friday for some areas in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico.

Strong winds caused wildfires in the Southern Plains, and severe storms and tornadoes were also possible across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee, western North Carolina and South Carolina, and the western Florida Panhandle.

Oops, something went wrong

Elon Musk and Sam Altman finally found a common area of agreement — that a trial to settle their differences over the future of ChatGPT creator OpenAI should begin in December.

The proposal came in a joint court filing on Friday from Musk, Altman, OpenAI, and other named defendants, including Microsoft (MSFT). They asked for a two-week trial beginning Dec. 8.

A judge has ultimate discretion over whether to grant the joint request, though the California federal district court judge overseeing this case, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, is likely to agree on a date that both sides want.

The expedited battle is intended to weigh Musk's claims that Altman and OpenAI breached various agreements by planning to convert the artificial intelligence startup into a for-profit enterprise. He tried and failed to get a judge to approve an immediate injunction stopping the conversion.

Musk helped co-found OpenAI with Altman in 2015 by donating $45 million to the startup, which Musk claims was contingent on OpenAI remaining a nonprofit organization.

Musk parted ways over disagreements regarding how to move forward with the venture. He started a competing AI company called xAI. Musk alleges that allowing OpenAI to continue pursuing for-profit status would cause "irreparable harm" to Musk, xAI, investors, and the public.

Gonzalez Rogers, the judge overseeing this case, has made it clear she wants at least part of the dispute to go to trial.

“Something is going to trial in this case,” she told lawyers for Musk, OpenAI, and Microsoft in January.

On March 4, she even proposed an expedited trial for the "fall of 2025." The judge carved out some claims in Musk's lawsuit that likely won't go to trial until 2027 or 2028, including allegations that the defendants violated antitrust laws and that Altman violated laws prohibiting self-dealing.

Musk and Altman both told the judge they were in favor of a trial on the expedited claims in December. But that's where their agreement ends.

The parties disputed which of Musk's claims should go forward in the expedited trial and asked the judge to clarify. OpenAI also asked the judge to specify which claims remained open to defendant challenges.

According to Musk, the court should include his claim that OpenAI breached its duties as a charitable trust and its duty to operate in good faith, along with three claims alleging OpenAI entered into and violated a contract with Musk to remain a nonprofit.

According to Musk, Altman also breached laws against unfair competition by communicating a "fund no competitors" edict to OpenAI's current and prospective investors and permitting interlocking board positions between OpenAI and Microsoft.

OpenAI and the defendants deny those claims.

OpenAI asked the judge to include a broader set of Musk's claims, requesting that the trial also address his allegations of fraud, false advertising, breach of fiduciary duty, and civil racketeering violations.

Microsoft said it took no position on the scope of the expedited proceedings or the proposed case schedule but that it would ask to participate if claims against it were included in the December trial.

Microsoft also noted that the company requested a dismissal of all Musk's claims against it and that the court had yet to resolve its request.

The defendants have called Musk's allegations "false" and claimed he has no legal basis for blocking OpenAI's for-profit conversion.

Altman claims Musk wanted to fold OpenAI into his for-profit electric vehicle company, Tesla (TSLA), so that Tesla could provide it with additional funding.

Musk and a group of investors have since offered to purchase OpenAI for $97 billion. Gonzalez Rogers said in her ruling that the offer cut against Musk's claim that OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit business would cause Musk irreparable harm.

Musk named LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Microsoft executive Dee Templeton as defendants, claiming they illegally served as directors of both OpenAI and Microsoft at a time when the two companies were competing in the AI market.

Hoffman has since resigned from the nonprofit's board. Templeton is a nonvoting observer.

"I have significant concerns with Microsoft having put two members or two people on the board," Gonzales Rogers has said. "Whether or not they were voting — they were still information-sharing."

While Gonzales Rogers said some of Musk's claims would be fast-tracked for trial, she denied his request for an injunction that would have temporarily blocked the defendants from carrying out plans to turn the artificial intelligence charity into a for-profit business — and from transferring any material assets owned by OpenAI or its subsidiaries, including intellectual property.

As of October 2024, Microsoft had poured $13.75 billion into OpenAI.

Oops, something went wrong

Netflix (NFLX) stock rose about 4% in midday trading on Monday after MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman upgraded shares to Buy from Neutral and boosted his full-year price target to $1,100 from $850 prior.

"Netflix has won the streaming wars. Case closed," Fishman wrote in a note to clients. "But where does the company go from here? How much more runway for growth is ahead? Despite all of Netflix's recent success in reinvigorating growth, we believe its engagement will allow the company to better monetize and unlock greater profits in the years ahead."

Netflix stock has struggled in recent sessions as a broader market sell-off continues to slam high-flying tech names. Shares have fallen over 10% from the 52-week highs they reached just one month ago, when the stock was trading well above $1,000 a share.

But Fishman sees brighter days ahead, crediting the "Netflix flywheel" when it comes to the company's ability to expand margins.

In his note, the analyst said Netflix can afford to spend more on content due to its vast number of subscribers, which currently sits at nearly 302 million globally. As a reminder, the company will no longer reveal subscriber data beginning in its 2025 reporting cycle.

"Because it has more content, it drives better engagement, leading to more subscribers and possibly better pricing power in a virtuous cycle," Fishman said. "This is the enduring power of Netflix's first-mover advantage in streaming."

And with the company beginning to scale its two-year-old ad tier, a new runway of growth has been unlocked, according to the analyst.

Earlier this year, the company hiked subscription costs across its various streaming tiers in the US, including the ad plan, which still remains one of the cheapest tiers on the market.

Management said it decided to raise prices, as its content "has never been better," with more movies and TV shows expected throughout 2025. Sports and live events have also become staples within the Netflix ecosystem.

In November, the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson match attracted over 108 million global viewers, becoming the most-streamed sporting event of all time. For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers.

Similarly, the NFL games averaged around 30 million viewers. According to Netflix, it was its most-watched Christmas Day ever in the US. The company will continue to double down on sports amid the recent debut of WWE Raw. Rumors have also swirled the company could bid on UFC rights next.

"Despite all of Netflix's success to date, we think a still underappreciated aspect of Netflix's scale is its ability to better monetize its engagement in the years ahead," Fishman said.

In 2024, Netflix posted a record-breaking year, which included revenue growth of 16% as operating margins surged 600 basis points to nearly 27% — that's about 300 basis points higher than its guidance at the outset of the year.

Plus, the company added 41 million global subscribers last year, above the 36.6 million it added during the COVID-induced surge of 2020.

Password-sharing crackdowns helped aid those subscriber figures, and although the analyst expects the benefits of those crackdowns to slow in the near term, the company should continue to see subscriber upside from its content slate, with its ad tier serving as a longer-term catalyst for capturing new users.

The ad tier should also alleviate some pressure if the macroeconomic environment further deteriorates. Looking ahead, the company expects its ad business to double in size this year, previously noting "a top priority in 2025 is to improve our offering for advertisers."

And according to a MoffettNathanson analysis of time viewed from Nielsen compared to 2024 US revenues by platform, Netflix still has the opportunity to raise prices. The company's $0.40 of revenue per hour viewed pales in comparison to the likes of Paramount+ (PARA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), suggesting the company is under-earning relative to its peers.

"Yes, the current macroeconomic environment is uncertain and largely no one is impervious to a weakening consumer, but this analysis gives credence to the idea that Netflix still has ample runway ahead to take additional price increases in the US in the years ahead," Fishman said.

Overall, the analyst expects Netflix's operating margin to reach 29.5% in 2025 before eventually hitting broadcast-like margins of 40% by the year 2030.

Risks to those estimates include a failure to successfully build out and scale advertising revenues, along with an inability to further raise prices. Additionally, any material slowdown in subscriber growth coupled with a rapid increase in content spending would also pose threats to the downside.

Wall Street analysts who cover Netflix have a median price target of just around $1,090 a share with 44 Buy ratings, 13 Holds, and just two Sells, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates.

A liquidation plan at Canada's oldest company could begin at all of its locations as soon as Tuesday and last for up to 12 weeks, but Hudson's Bay is still holding out hope that it will find a lifeline.

Lawyers for the beleaguered retailer said in an Ontario court Monday morning that if approved by the judge, the liquidation would span 80 stores as well as three Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks Off 5th locations in Canada that it owns through a licensing agreement.

The process Hudson's Bay is proposing would allow the retailer to remove some stores from the liquidation, should it find sufficient financing during the 10 to 12 weeks when lawyer Ashley Taylor expects the company to offload its inventory.

"A quick start will maximize the value of the business ... and preserve whatever chance there is of a restructuring," Taylor told Ontario Superior Court Judge Peter Osborne in a hearing at a Toronto courtroom Monday.

Hudson's Bay plans to liquidate business, close all stores

The hearing attracted so many lawyers, media and other observers that an overflow room had to be opened to facilitate spectators there to learn what will come of the retailer dating back to 1670, when the country was involved with the fur trade.

The hearing was meant to advance a creditor protection case Hudson's Bay launched March 7, when it admitted it was struggling with financial difficulties amid subdued consumer spending, Canada-U.S. trade tensions and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.

It said the situation has become so bad that it deferred some payments to landlords, service providers and vendors and was days away from not being able to meet payroll obligations.

As it struggled, a landlord "unlawfully locked" Hudson's Bay out of a store located in Sydney, N.S., and a team of bailiffs attempted to seize merchandise from a location it runs in Toronto, Ont., mall Sherway Gardens, said Jennifer Bewley, the chief financial officer for Hudson's Bay's parent company, in a court filing.

When the company filed for creditor protection, Hudson's Bay lawyer Taylor said the retailer's plan was to restructure by liquidating half its stores and monetizing some of the leases it tends to hold in prime, high-traffic spaces.

That plan was to be carried out under debtor-in-possession financing, which lenders make available to troubled companies in order to help them restructure.

In the run-up to the March 7 court hearing, Taylor said the company had two lenders interested in supplying that funding. But three hours before, the financing from its chosen suitor "fell apart" and the retailer "scrambled" to get an alternative together.

That alternative came in the form of $16 million in funding commitments from U.S.-based investment management firm Restore Capital and other lenders, expanded to $23 million soon after.

Despite the boost, the commitments weren't enough to satisfy all of Hudson's Bay's needs, forcing the company to "double" its efforts to find more cash, Taylor said.

It's since reached out to at least 19 potential lenders and major landlords who could offer rent concessions.

"To date, the company's efforts have failed," Taylor said in court Monday as he described why the company needed to pursue liquidation.

The liquidation Hudson's Bay is seeking will span the company's entire footprint, with Ontario taking the bulk of the hit because it's where the company has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work. B.C. hosts 16 locations; Alberta and Quebec each have 13; and Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have two per province.

Saks Fifth Avenue's Canadian sites are split between Ontario and Alberta and Saks Off 5th has stores in Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba.

Liquidating its entire business would put more than 9,000 jobs at risk.

Elizabeth Pillon, another lawyer who appeared on Hudson's Bay's behalf, said the company has about $315 million in inventory on its balance sheet right now and the proposed liquidation will extend to its e-commerce business, which will continue until the company's Scarborough, Ont., distribution centre empties.

The company plans to stop accepting gift cards after April 6 and has already paused its loyalty program, with more than 8.2 million Canadian customers holding about $58.5 million in unused points.

Hudson's Bay is also seeking permission to launch a process to find a buyer for some or all of its properties or the business.

The process would allow potential buyers to make a bid for some of the company's leases or just intellectual property, like Hudson's Bay's branding or rights to its famed stripe trademarks.

The company will also keep seeking financing. But some experts say finding a backer will be no easy feat for a business that has struggled with even "simple" matters like keeping escalators working.

"It is a major challenge and no doubt with some large strings attached," said Lanita Layton, a luxury and retail consultant and a former Holt Renfrew vice-president, in an email.

"Depending on who, if anyone does bring the financing, I don't foresee HBC continuing in the same format."

She says Hudson's Bay's most logical path forward will be shrinking the company to a "manageable size" by operating a smaller number of stores more "conducive to today's customer desires," which include a unique product mix, experiential opportunities, exciting visuals and great customer service.

"This marks the end of a nearly 400-year-old institution which is going to have significant impacts in reshaping the Canadian retail landscape, with major consequences for employees, customers, as well as broader retailers operating in Canada," said Jenna Jacobson, director of the Retail Leadership Institute at Toronto Metropolitan University.

This could be a real challenge for malls as large department stores act as the anchors in a lot of malls and also act as the driver to bring in consumers, she said.

"Filling that space is very challenging, because what retailer is able to take over that amount of space."

Hudson's Bay Company, in its original form, was founded by fur traders and owned a vast tract of northern Canada around Hudson Bay where it operated a far-flung chain of trading posts.

Dating back to 1670, it has been deeply entrenched in Canadian history, but has been led by Americans for several decades now.

The architect behind most of the Bay's modern history is Richard Baker, an American real estate titan whose National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought the company in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.

Baker took it public in 2012, only to reverse course through a takeover bid that had to be sweetened twice before shareholders accepted it in early 2020, ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

Oops, something went wrong

Tesla stock (TSLA) is dropping on Monday after a rough few weeks for the automaker. The stock is down more than 6%. Shares of the EV maker dropped 8% last week alone, and have now fallen for eight straight weeks, with the company shedding hundreds of billions in market value.

Driving the news today is a report out of China, one of the company's most important regions. Per the company's website, Tesla is offering a free trial of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) autonomous software on the mainland, but it's not enough to quell investors' fears, however.

The deal — which runs from March 17 through April 16, isn't just limited to new buyers but is open to any owner whose Tesla is equipped with the latest hardware computer, software, and mapping data, according to a Tesla statement to its users, reported by Reuters.

Tesla's issues with self-driving in China are well known. The company has struggled with data collection from the vehicles in China because of the government's data privacy laws, which prevent Tesla from sending data collected in China to its servers in the US.

During Tesla's Q1 earnings call, when asked about the FSD rollout in China, CEO Elon Musk said difficulties remain. "We do have some challenges because ... they currently don't allow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the US government won't let us do training in China. So, we're in a bit of a bind there. It's like a quandary.”

Tesla is working with Chinese partners like Baidu to improve its mapping data by integrating Baidu's mapping information along with lane marking and traffic signal locations into its FSD, Reuters reported last week.

This development is a marked change for Tesla's strategy with self-driving, which relies on visual data alone to evaluate road conditions and markings, by integrating non-visual data for use with FSD.

Tesla's FSD is also considered less advanced than rival software seen in Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Xpeng, and others. BYD, the biggest EV brand in China, inked a deal with DeepSeek AI to co-develop new autonomous technology with its “God's Eye” advanced driver assistance system, a major threat to Tesla.

Looking big picture, challenges in China come on top of difficulties the company is facing in Europe, as well as brand erosion Tesla is seeing in the US.

In addition to new, more cost-competitive products challenging Tesla sales, many of Tesla's troubles stem from Musk's behavior.

As head of the White House's controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, Musk has seen his standing slide among Americans as protests have gained steam at Tesla showrooms in the US. Musk's meddling in German and UK politics by supporting far-right parties has also hurt his standing in those regions.

Official confirmation of Tesla's global sales will come in early April when the company reports first quarter deliveries.

JPMorgan is the latest investment bank to cut its delivery forecast for the company. Analyst Ryan Brinkman now expects Q1 deliveries of 355,000, down 8% year over year and down 28% from the 495,000 reported in Q4. Brinkman's new estimate is substantially lower than the firm's prior estimate of 444,000 and 15% below the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 418,000, he said.

In cutting the firm's price target to $120 from $130 (one of the Street's lowest), Brinkman didn't mince words.

“We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly, with perhaps the closest example being the decline in sales of Japanese and Korean brand vehicles in China in 2012 and 2017,” which stemmed from deep trade disputes, Brinkman said.

Flagging global sales and Elon Musk's increasingly outspoken political activities are combining to rock the value of Tesla.

Shares in the once-trillion-dollar company saw their worst day in five years this week. Year to date, Tesla's stock has plunged 41% — though it is still up by about 36% over the past 12 months.

On Monday, the stock was down another 5%. 

For Musk, Tesla's shares remain his primary source of paper wealth, though he has also turned his stake in SpaceX into a personal lending tool. But it was proceeds from selling Tesla shares that helped Musk complete his acquisition of Twitter, now known as X.

Musk's wealth also allowed him to help vault Donald Trump into a second presidential term. Even as Musk's net worth has diminished as a result of Tesla's recent share-price declines, data suggests he is in no danger of losing his title as the world's wealthiest person.

Musk has said on X that he is not concerned about Tesla's recent drop in value. Still, evidence suggests the company is entering a period of transition.

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Musk's wealth has propelled him to a global presence that lacks precedent — and has polarized world opinion about the tech entrepreneur in the process. Any weakening of his financial position, therefore, could undercut his influence in the political and tech spaces where he now commands outsize attention.According to Bank of America, Tesla's European sales plummeted by about 50% in January compared with the same month a year prior.

Some say this is attributable to a growing distaste for Musk, who has begun dabbling in the continent's politics in the wake of his successful support of Trump's candidacy last year.

Others note Tesla's European market is facing increased competition from the Chinese electric-vehicle maker BYD, which has telegraphed ambitious plans for expansion on the continent.  

A more decisive blow to Tesla's near-term fortunes may be emanating from China itself. There, Tesla's shipments plunged 49% in February from a year earlier, to just 30,688 vehicles, according to official data cited by Bloomberg News. That's the lowest monthly figure registered since July 2022 — amid the throes of Covid-19 — when it shipped just 28,217 EVs, Bloomberg said.

Tesla is now facing intense competition from other Chinese EV makers, including BYD.

Yet even there, a Chinese official also warned about the impact of Musk's high-profile politicking.

“As a successful businessman, one should be embracing 100% of the market: Treat everyone nicely, and everyone will be nice in return,” the secretary of China's Passenger Car Association, said in a briefing Monday, Bloomberg reported. “But if you look at it in terms of voting, then half of voters will be friendly to you and half of them won't be.”

“This is the unavoidable risk that's come after he got his personal glory,” the secretary, Cui Dongshu, said Monday, referring to Musk.

On Friday, Reuters reported Tesla was planning to sell a Model Y costing at least 20% less to produce to defend its China share.

And in the U.S., Tesla's January sales were down about 11%, according to data from the S&P Global analytics group — an outlier at a time when EV sales for all other brands are trending higher in America.

Though he has long worn multiple proverbial hats, Musk's role in the White House as nominal head of the Department of Government Efficiency may be his most consequential. And having influence with the Trump administration could be critical to Tesla's fortunes. This week, Trump promised he would purchase a Tesla in a showy presentation on the White House lawn, seemingly further cementing the Trump-Musk alliance.

On X — the social media platform he owns — Musk's frenetic posting is increasingly focused on politics and America's culture wars, with an occasional nod to SpaceX launches.

His apparently undiminished role in the Trump administration — he was seen leaving the White House last weekend alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — has sparked boycotts in Europe, as well as protests and even acts of vandalism against auto owners in the U.S.

“When people's cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent to Musk might think twice about buying a Tesla,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, told CNBC's “Squawk on the Street” on Monday.

In a note to clients this week downgrading its estimate of deliveries, analysts with JPMorgan said the damage to Tesla's brand has been serious.

“We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” they wrote.

Tesla itself is warning about the fallout from retaliatory measures taken by countries targeted by Trump's tariffs, saying in a letter to the U.S. trade representative this week that the company may be “exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions.”

Already, the Canadian province of British Columbia has announced it was ending subsidies for Tesla's products.

For all the oxygen Musk has taken up with his political activities, concerns about Tesla products themselves are equally keeping investors and analysts up at night.

Musk has “neglect[ed] the rest of Tesla's automotive business as he thought that by the end of every year for the last 6 years, Tesla would be able to flip a switch and make all its vehicles self-driving — automatically increasing their value and making them infinitely more competitive than other vehicles,” Fred Lambert, who covers the company for the Electrek electric vehicle blog, wrote in a recent post.

Meanwhile, Musk decided to kill Tesla's cheaper, $25,000 model while going all-in on the Cybertruck, whose sales have yet to take off, Lambert said.

“Tesla's core business remains selling cars and batteries,” he wrote. “There's no doubt that the business of selling cars is not going well for Tesla right now, and under Musk, there's no clear path to improvement.”

By contrast, many analysts continue to take a much longer view of Tesla's outlook. In his most recent note to clients about the company, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, one of the most closely watched observers of Tesla, summarized the long-term outlook that he says continues to justify the company's eye-watering valuation.

“Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive ‘pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,” he wrote in a note March 2.

While that was before the most recent sell-off intensified, Jonas said he was already discounting market gyrations.

“While the journey may be volatile and non-linear, we believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage,” he wrote.

				New Products 

Seed Golf is marking St Patrick's Day [March 17] with the launch of ‘The Craic', a limited-edition variant of its signature SD-01 golf ball that celebrates the Irish brand's heritage.

Embellished with the image of a traditional Irish pint of stout, the ball headlines a full product range that also includes ‘Craic' ball markers, a divot repair tool, a cap, towel and umbrellas. Each item can be bought individually or as part of ‘The Craic Pack', priced at £75 on Seed's online store.

‘Craic' is an Irish slang term for a fun, lively time spent in good company – the essence of Seed's golfing philosophy. The brand was founded in Ireland, and the country remains Seed's home as it expands to all corners of the globe.

Known as ‘The Pro One', the SD-01 is Seed's first and best-selling ball, launching alongside the company in 2017. Now in its third iteration, the SD-01 is a three-piece Tour construction ball with an ultra-thin urethane cover and can fly up to 306 yards.

Dean Klatt, founder and CEO of Seed Golf, said: “We wanted the Craic range to be a celebration of not only St. Patrick's Day but Ireland itself – the place that will always be Seed's home even as we expand operations to more countries than ever before.

“As well as the SD-01, which is our flagship ball for a good reason, we've given nearly all of our non-ball products the Craic treatment – so even if all your Craic balls eventually end up in a lake somewhere you can have something from the range in your golf bag for a long time.”

All of Seed's balls can be purchased in individual boxes or via an online subscription-based service.

At the start of 2025, Seed announced a major ramp-up of global operations, including new distribution channels in the United States and Australia.

Foremost Golf, the UK's largest retail and marketing services group, has announced 250 users of its innovative Point of Sale (POS) software system, after its main launch last year.

Golfstream, a leading player in the UK electric and push trolley market, is celebrating its 18th year in business with a comprehensive brand refresh.

Resorts and clubs from across the UK & Ireland came together at The Double Tree by Hilton at Stadium MK last night [March 13], as 59club UK and Ireland recognised the outstanding venues, teams and individuals in the golf, leisure and spa industry.

Hyperfine and NVIDIA Collaborate to Revolutionize Neuroimaging with AI-Powered Innovation

Collaboration aims to make portable MRI faster, smarter, and more accessible worldwide.

The AI-powered Swoop® portable MR brain imaging system.

GUILFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hyperfine, Inc. (Nasdaq: HYPR), the groundbreaking health technology company that has redefined brain imaging with the first FDA-cleared AI-powered portable magnetic resonance (MR) brain imaging system—the Swoop® system—today announced a strategic collaboration with NVIDIA. This collaboration leverages NVIDIA AI expertise and accelerated computing to enhance Hyperfine portable imaging technology—making brain MRI faster, smarter, and more affordable on a global scale.


Brain diseases affect over three billion people worldwide1, with conditions such as stroke and neurodegenerative disorders responsible for significant mortality, disability, and economic burden. However, 90% of the global population lacks access to timely MRI diagnostics2 due to the high cost and infrastructure demands of conventional MRI systems. Hyperfine transforms this paradigm with its AI-powered portable MR technology. Designed for use at the point of care in professional healthcare settings by any trained clinician, it addresses critical healthcare gaps that conventional MRI systems cannot fill.




The collaboration between Hyperfine and NVIDIA will focus on advancing AI-powered image reconstruction and embedding real-time clinical decision support into portable MRI workflow. By leveraging the NVIDIA advanced suite of training and inference tools, such as NVIDIA DALI and MONAI, the collaboration seeks to further improve the Swoop® system's image quality, reduce scan times, and enable faster, more reliable diagnoses.




“Our mission is to make portable brain imaging faster, more intelligent, and increasingly accessible—ultimately improving health outcomes and reducing costs globally,” said Maria Sainz, President and CEO of Hyperfine, Inc. “Partnering with NVIDIA presents an incredible opportunity to advance and accelerate our AI technology. I'm thrilled about the possibilities this collaboration brings for the future.”

Canadian tariffs push costs up while Trump's tariffs push demand down — Desjardins

Expect to pay more for everything from new cars to your weekly grocery shop as the tariff war between Canada and the United States squeezes some businesses at both ends, economists warn.

So far U.S. President Donald Trump has put tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and threatened more to come on April 2. In retaliation, Canada has slapped duties on about $60 billion worth of U.S. goods and threatened them on another $100 billion.

Trump's tariffs will have the biggest impact on the economy, said Florence Jean-Jacobs, principal economist at Desjardins Group, but there will also be negative repercussions from Canada's counter tariffs and a weaker Canadian dollar for businesses who import materials from the United States.

“Some industries are caught between a rock and a hard place, risking a drop in U.S. demand for their products and an increase in their supply costs if substitutes are not easily found,” she wrote in her report.

The hardest hit sectors will be food manufacturing, machinery, plastics, chemical, automobiles, aerospace, wholesale trade and livestock and crop production.

Take, for example, a food manufacturer in Canada who exports to the United States. They would have to pay more to import grains, fruits and other raw materials from the U.S. to make their product because of Canadian tariffs, only to see sales fall south of the border because U.S. tariffs make them more expensive.

Even sectors that are considered resilient to Trump's direct tariffs such as construction, retail and food services will face higher costs because of Canada's retaliatory duties and a weak Canadian dollar.

Canada's construction industry will pay more for products it buys from the U.S. that range from heating and air conditioning equipment to furniture and cabinets to electrical and plumbing fixtures.

Auto wholesalers and dealers will pay more for cars imported from the U.S. as will retailers of clothing, food and beverages, pharmaceuticals and medical suppliers, said the Desjardins report.

“We can therefore expect consumers to pay higher prices for cars and parts imported from the United States and for food purchases that are hard to replace with Canadian or overseas products at equivalent cost,” said Jean-Jacobs.

The low loonie could also raise the price of gas, especially in eastern Canada where refineries are not set up to handle Western Canada's heavy oil and rely on imports from the United States.

The squeeze at both ends could lead to liquidity challenges for some companies, said the economist.

“They will have to choose between reducing their profits or increasing their selling prices, which will weaken their power to retain and attract customers already burned by the record-high inflation that followed the pandemic.”

The challenge will be especially difficult for low-margin businesses.

“Car dealerships and grocery stores, in particular, have some of the lowest margins among non-financial industries in Canada. Since Canada's counter-tariffs particularly target food and automobiles, these businesses could face significant challenges,” she said.

Jean-Jacobs said government support in reducing Canada's internal trade barriers, increasing productivity and exploring alternative markets will all help, “but companies will need to be proactive and invest to build their resilience against what's shaping up to be four years of uncertainty and volatility.”

How much do Trump's 25 per-cent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports matter to Canada? These sectors are highly dependent on the U.S. market, but in the big picture make up only 6 per cent of Canada's total merchandise exports.

The regional impact, however, is significant, in particular to Ontario and Quebec, said TD Economics' Maria Solovieva. Ontario produces most of the steel exports to the U.S. and Quebec the aluminum.

Quebec isn't just the biggest aluminum producer in Canada, it's the biggest on the continent and ranks fourth in the world behind China, India, and Russia.

If you're thinking of starting a new business and need advice on what to do, your first move should be turning to an artificial intelligence chatbot tool, like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude.

That's according to Steve Blank, who has written four books on the subject of entrepreneurship. He helped build eight different tech startups, of which he co-founded four, before retiring over two decades ago. His final startup, business software company Epiphany, sold to SSA Global Technologies for $329 million in 2005.

Blank is currently an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where he teaches courses on innovation and his Lean Startup method.

For years, Steve Blank has advised students and the founders he advises to "get the heck outside" of the office or classroom to talk to actual potential customers and find out what it is they want and build their prospective businesses accordingly. Now, he says, AI's generative tech can make that process even more effective.

"AI [is] a force multiplier to everything you do," Blank tells CNBC Make It. "AI could help you figure out where to get outside, probably faster than anything else. If you have a business idea, [ask] something like ChatGPT: 'I have Idea X, has anybody done it? Why hasn't [it] worked? Where should I best do this?'"

In addition to summarizing market research and offering feedback, some AI chatbots can write you a whole business plan. That free feature in ChatGPT, as well as in other platforms like Grammarly and Canva, can help give you a significant boost without the need to pay thousands of dollars for a freelance business consultant, Blank says.

"Just imagine you have Steve Blank over your shoulder, helping you ask these questions," says Blank. With AI, "you have at your fingertips a pretty good consultant [who] in the past would have charged you $10,000."

Though they have made rapid advances in recent years, AI tools are still far from foolproof. Their responses frequently include errors known as "hallucinations." Blank advises that anyone turning to AI for a business plan take recommendations with a grain of salt.

"Somewhere between 10% and 50% of their answers are bullshit, sure. And the problem is you don't know which ones," Blank says. One 2023 study from AI startup Vectara found that chatbots hallucinate as much as 27% of the time, while a recent BBC study found that roughly half of AI assistants' answers to news-related questions contained errors.

Even if they're far from perfect, though, Blank argues that these tools still have plenty of value, particularly for first-time entrepreneurs who want to move forward with a business idea and aren't entirely sure what steps to take. He compares getting business feedback from AI tools to "having a pretty smart friend who's kind of riffing." Maybe every single suggestion they have isn't brilliant, but they could give you some good starting points you might not have thought of on your own.

"If you take everything at face value, you might drive over the cliff, but they're giving you some great ideas to think about, particularly if you've really never done this before," Blank says.

Feed a few simple initial questions into an AI tool, he suggests: The answers generated can help give you some clarity about whether there is a legitimate "product-market fit" for your idea. For example:

AI-generated insights should never be a stand-in for boots-on-the-ground research, Blank says — putting in that work remains essential for any entrepreneur mapping out a new business. The crux of the "lean startup" method Blank has taught for decades is speaking with a cross-section of potential customers and clients as early in the ideation process as possible, and then using their feedback to determine the viability of any concept.

AI still "doesn't eliminate the need for getting out and testing the fundamental assumptions," Blank says. "Whether it's a restaurant or a consulting business or gardening store or whatever, you have a set of assumptions. The most important one is: 'Well, who are my customers?' And the second one is: 'What do they want?'"

Answering those questions before moving ahead with a business idea is essential, because they speak to the fundamental focus and strength of any potential business, Blank says. Not doing so is a major mistake that can doom a new company before it launches.

That said, prospective business owners who are unwilling to use AI tools put themselves at a distinct disadvantage, too, Blank says.

"You don't want to compete with someone who has an AI at their shoulder, because they're acting like they have a team of 20 people coaching them," says Blank. In addition to testing the hypothesis of a business idea, after all, AI assistants can help overwhelmed founders handle aspects of their business' finances, administrative tasks and web design.

"If you don't want to use it as a tool," fine, Blank says. "No one is going to stop you not wanting to succeed."

				New Products 

Golfstream, a leading player in the UK electric and push trolley market, is celebrating its 18th year in business with a comprehensive brand refresh.

The stylish rebrand introduces a refined product lineup under the banner of the new GX Series, along with performance and design enhancements and an upgraded digital presence to better serve consumers and retailers alike.

INTRODUCING THE GX SERIESAs part of the brand transformation, Golfstream's electric trolley range will now be relaunched under the GX Series, offering a clearer and more intuitive product differentiation.

Golfstream's well-established Blue, Vision, and Vision Brake electric trolley models will now be known as the GX1, GX3, and GX5, respectively. Each model has been upgraded with enhanced design and performance features, ensuring a superior golfing experience.

Golfstream's commitment to user-friendly innovation continues across all GX Series models. All trolleys feature Golfstream's signature effortless one-touch folding mechanism, making setup and storage quick and convenient. Their lightweight, compact design ensures they can be transported easily, folding down to be among the most space-efficient electric trolleys on the market.

Each model secures the bag using side arms rather than the traditional central spine, significantly reducing any ‘bag wobble' on uneven terrain. Additionally, all three trolleys come with a non-clogging front wheel and detachable main wheels, simplifying cleaning and maintenance.



Power & EfficiencyGolfstream trolleys are powered by an 18-hole lithium CaddyCell LifePO4 battery as standard, driving a 230V whisper-quiet motor that effortlessly handles any terrain. For golfers seeking extended play time, a 36-hole battery option is available, ensuring uninterrupted performance across multiple rounds.

Colour CustomisationCustomisability is another hallmark of Golfstream's rebrand, with a variety of new colour schemes available, including fuchsia, yellow, blue, red, teal, and green. 

Golfstream also offers a full range of accessories, such as umbrella holders, drink holders, GPS/phone holders, carry bags, and scorecard holders, to further enhance the golfing experience.





A Fresh Digital ExperienceIn tandem with the product rebrand, Golfstream has unveiled a new-look website to provide a more engaging and informative user experience. The redesigned site features detailed product descriptions, new video content, and a seamless interface to help retailers and consumers navigate the updated lineup with ease.

Golfstream's new GX Series trolleys, and a complete range of accessories, are available for purchase online at www.golfstream.co.uk and through select retailers and pro shops.

SolasCure Enrols First Patient in a Next Phase II Clinical Trial to Advance Aurase Wound Gel

Phase II clinical trial to determine the efficacy of Aurase Wound Gel at a higher concentration of the active enzyme Tarumase in venous leg ulcers

CAMBRIDGE, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SOLASCURE Ltd (SolasCure), a biotechnology company developing a novel treatment to transform chronic wound healing, today announced the initiation of a new Phase II clinical trial, CLEANVLU2. The enrolment of the trial's first patient marks a new clinical milestone in the development of its investigational product, Aurase Wound Gel, for the treatment of chronic wounds.


Aurase Wound Gel is a hydrogel releasing Tarumase, a recombinant enzyme originally cloned from medical maggots that selectively targets fibrin, collagen and elastin in wounds to promote healing through debridement and wound bed preparation. CLEANVLU2 adds further insight to the successful Phase IIa clinical study, CLEANVLU 1, which established proof-of-concept, a strong safety profile and pain-free application. The new randomised controlled trial will explore the efficacy of Tarumase at higher concentration, in patients with venous leg ulcers.




Chronic wounds affect around 100 million people globally, representing a significant healthcare challenge with limited safe, pain-free, and effective treatments. Clinical data suggest that, after 6 weeks of the current standard of care treatment, overall wound closure is achieved in as little as 41% of chronic or hard-to-heal wounds 2. This trial will generate key efficacy data to further demonstrate Aurase Wound Gel's potential as the first treatment to address all aspects of wound bed preparation including debridement, informing investors and potential strategic partners.




The trial is being run in association with South Leicestershire Medical Group, UK, as part of its community service. Once the CLEANVLU2 study is completed, a further Phase II study is planned over a longer period, with stratification for factors that may affect debridement and wound healing, before moving into confirmatory clinical Phase III trials for regulatory approval.




Andy Weymann MD, MBA, Chairman of the Board, SolasCure said: “This trial is pivotal for fully demonstrating proof-of-concept of efficacy for Aurase Wound Gel with a stronger concentration of the enzyme Tarumase. This will help us to establish that the product can achieve complete debridement in 6-9 applications aligned with standard of care and have a positive influence on the rate of healing. This is what the market has been waiting for and brings Aurase Wound Gel a step closer to providing relief to those suffering from chronic wounds worldwide.”

Bruce Andrews and Connor Bernard from mid-market aviation and defence M&A specialists Alderman & Company, advises company owners to embrace the space race

With the world growing ever more interconnected on a daily basis, satellite internet has quickly emerged from being a niche technology into being a global communication, defence, and business mainstay.

As data multiplies and efforts are made to bridge the divide between the offline and online population, players like SpaceX's Starlink and Blue Origin's Project Kuiper have emerged as the primary players in the field.

But as the reliance on satellite-based connectivity grows, it is more and more clear that a single controlling force could stifle innovation, raise prices, and even threaten national security.

This article explores the situation now, highlights Starlink's controlling position and Blue Origin's status and argues for why robust competition needs to be maintained in order to safeguard the future of satellite internet.

In order for direct-to-consumer high speed/high quality internet to be deployed worldwide there are two significant challenges.

The first challenge is the design and manufacture of thousands of small affordable technically sophisticated satellites combined with ground-based sender/receiver routers (so-called “Dishy” by Starlink) to permit direct to consumer internet reception.

The second challenge is to deploy the thousands of satellites into their respective orbits to create the satellite constellation. Clearly, Starlink has had the advantage in deployment thanks to the incredible success of SpaceX and the Falcon series of rockets.

Starlink has quickly become a synonym for satellite internet innovation. The company's aggressive deployment plan has resulted in a constellation of over 7,000 satellites in low Earth orbit and expansion plans for worldwide internet access with 42,000 satellites.

This large network already has offered real-world service to rural and underserved areas, revolutionising access to high-speed internet where the traditional infrastructure is not present.

Starlink's success extends past consumer markets; its technology has attracted significant government interest. Especially noteworthy are the Department of Defense contracts valued at approximately $733 million.

These highlights not only refer to first to market advantage but also to iterative improvements that have positioned Starlink as the industry standard-bearer.

The company's commitment to bringing people closer together all over the world is also reflected in its continuing innovation and swift growth, keeping even the remotest part of the world connected.

While Starlink has been going at an enormous speed, Project Kuiper of Blue Origin has encountered a succession of setbacks that have kept it from deployable success.

Delays in securing reliable launch vehicles, including United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur and Blue Origin's own New Glenn rocket, have significantly pushed back its deployment schedule.

Additionally, the project has faced manufacturing and regulatory challenges, compressing the timeline to meet FCC requirements that mandate at least half of its planned 3,236-satellite constellation be deployed by mid-2026.

These logistical hurdles have further postponed Project Kuiper's ability to begin providing commercial service, creating a widening gap between it and Starlink.

While Blue Origin remains committed to the initiative, the disparity in execution underscores how difficult it is to compete with Starlink's first-mover advantage and aggressive rollout strategy.

Project Kuiper's plans to manufacture satellites were initially envisioned for the first half of 2024 at a rate of five satellites per day but start-up issues delayed rate production to the end of 2024. Beta trials with paying users are envisioned in 2025.

Delays are indicative of the historic-sized issues with satellite mass production, management of complex supply chains, and transition from development to operation on a large scale.

As opposed to Starlink, with its enormous real-world experience, Project Kuiper is just starting to demonstrate viability at commercial levels.

That delay in practical experience not only postpones Blue Origin's market entry but also weakens its position in a rapidly evolving industry.

Competing against an established leader like Starlink, which continuously refines its technology and expands its reach, makes catching up increasingly difficult.

A future where Starlink dominates satellite internet poses risks, as a single company controlling such critical infrastructure could dictate pricing, limit service availability, and slow innovation.

Additionally, governments and industries relying on satellite connectivity may become overly dependent on one provider, creating economic and security vulnerabilities.

There is, however, significant good news and major progress achieved by Project Kuiper in recent months. Project Kuiper's new satellite manufacturing facility in Kirkland, Washington has been completed and is successfully producing higher satellite volumes.

Project Kuiper is also near completion of a satellite support facility on site at Cape Canaveral.

This facility is designed to complete system integration, perform satellite maintenance, and store completed satellites in preparation for charging its launch vehicles.

Significantly, Project Kuiper has also secured 83 launch reservations from its own Blue Origin rockets, United Launch Alliance, Arianespace, and from SpaceX, its direct competitor.

Thus, Project Kuiper is on the cusp of success having overcome the two key challenges of volume manufacturing and launch capacity.

Project Kuiper should be in the competitively challenging position of its goal of creating its own satellite constellation of 3,236 satellites in three orbital planes by the 2026/2027 timeframe.

With new entrants such as Amazon's Project Kuiper and other potential start-ups, a more dynamic and resilient market awaits.

These companies may well offer alternative technologies, new service models, and diverse approaches to global connectivity.

In a multi-firm market, consumers benefit from competitive pricing, improved service quality, and accelerated innovation.

A diversified industry also reduces reliance on a single provider, enhancing security and reliability.

While SpaceX's Starlink leads with services in over 100 countries, competition drives advancements and prevents monopolistic control over critical infrastructure.

The satellite internet industry is at a crossroads—though Starlink's success is significant, long-term sustainability depends on creating and maintaining a competitive market.

Having multiple competitors will lead to innovation and lower prices while also assuring that the network is more resistant to attacks from single points of failure.

With global demand for connectivity increasing relentlessly, it is not merely a question of economic efficiency to level the playing field for all contestants—it is a matter of strategy.

Opening ourselves to competition now is a gateway to a healthier, more dynamic, and safer satellite internet world tomorrow.

As specialists in the selling of middle market aerospace and defense companies, we believe that it is advisable for company owners to ensure they participate in those companies and technologies that support the growing space sector.

The sector is not only rapidly expanding but contains many areas in which to participate from launch vehicles to payloads to Space Infrastructure projects (e.g., debris detection and removal, ground support equipment, communication equipment, etc.).

We strongly encourage embracing the space sector for future growth and success.

      America's biggest retailers are deploying every weapon they have to navigate President Trump's fast-escalating trade war, from leaning on suppliers for discounts to finding alternate product sources. In some cases, that includes price increases for consumers.


     
      Much of the action so far has focused on goods from China, which the Trump administration hit with a 10% tariff in February and another 10% in March. Some suppliers say Walmart, Home Depot and other retailers are pushing a variation of the same demand: Make a price concession or shift production out of China. Otherwise, the suppliers risk losing some business.


     
      The sometimes-tense deliberations among retailers and suppliers show how Trump's trade agenda is already rippling through global supply chains, with billions of dollars of consumer spending at stake.


     
      “Companies are completely under the gun and panicking," said Joe Jurken, founder of the ABC Group in Milwaukee, which helps U.S. businesses manage supply chains in Asia. He has received a flood of inquiries from manufacturers facing pressure from retailers to move production out of China, he said.


     
      Some of the requests have raised the ire of Chinese officials. Authorities in China summoned Walmart for a meeting in recent days after some suppliers complained the largest U.S. retailer by annual revenue was pressuring them to cut prices and absorb the tariff cost.


     
      Walmart said it was in discussions with suppliers to help consumers save money and that it would continue to work closely with them “to find the best way forward during these uncertain times."


     
      Some pricing negotiations are hitting an impasse because many of these manufacturers are often already operating on razor-thin margins, according to suppliers. And retailers don't want to raise prices for shoppers so they can continue to compete for market share.


     
      William Liu, sales director for Rongli Garments, a Chinese manufacturer that makes seamless apparel, said that when the 10% tariff hit in February, his company agreed to lower prices by 5% for Walmart, though it cut into the garment maker's profit margins. After Trump imposed the additional 10% tariff, Walmart asked his company to raise the discount to 10%. Liu's company couldn't afford to absorb the cost and, as a result, Walmart is seeking new suppliers outside China, Liu said.


     
      Target, too, is talking to suppliers about how to share any additional costs, said Rick Gomez, chief commercial officer for the company. “Right now, a lot of those negotiations are going on."


     
      Some of the haggling has prompted more sourcing from outside of China. After the first 10% tariff on Chinese goods in February, Home Depot asked one of its U.S. suppliers of lighting and home decor to absorb the cost, according to an executive at the supplier. The supplier agreed to a two-month, 10% discount, part of which would be covered by its Chinese manufacturer.


     
      After the second 10% tariff in March, the supplier declined another request from Home Depot to lower prices again. Instead, the supplier is moving production to Southeast Asia so it can eventually charge the home-improvement retailer the original price, the executive said.


     
      A Home Depot spokeswoman said the company has been diversifying its sourcing for more than a decade. “We do this partnering with our vendors typically over several years," she said.


     
      The tariff planning is especially complicated because companies have little sense of which tariff threats will materialize and where new ones could emerge, retailers and suppliers say. Bouqs Co., an online flower company, learned that lesson soon after Trump took office and threatened a 25% tariff against goods imported from Colombia because of the country's initial refusal to accept repatriation flights from the U.S.


     
      That sent Bouqs executives into an emergency weekend meeting, during which they came up with a plan for Bouqs and its partners to share costs if tariffs emerge, Chief Executive Kim Tobman said. Farms in Colombia provide much of the cut flowers sold in the U.S. Bouqs sells goods directly to shoppers as well as inside Amazon.com's Whole Foods.


     
      “We had been thinking China," Tobman said. “There was no talk in our world about Colombia."


     
      Trump reversed course a few days later after Colombia accepted the repatriation flights. “It was a real shocker and stress for our team" and came just ahead of Valentine's Day, one of the industry's biggest sales days, she said.


     
      Now as the president threatens additional tariffs on a range of other trading partners, companies are worried about investing resources into moving production, only to potentially face duties on goods from those locations.


     
      “Choosing any other country other than the U.S. and thinking it's a safe haven is risky," said Kimberly Kirkendall, president of International Resource Development, an international supply-chain consulting firm that works with U.S. suppliers. “If your business is big enough and you've got the financial wherewithal to have multiple manufacturing sites, then that's the best strategy."


     
      In some cases, retailers and manufacturers have decided it is worth it to keep production in China to maintain quality. Costco, the warehouse chain, plans to continue selling patio furniture made in China—even at an elevated price—because it is higher quality than versions made in other countries, Costco executives said. Costco and its supplier will absorb some of the cost increase and pass some on to shoppers, they said.


     
      Prices on all goods affected by tariffs won't go up equally. Retailers create their tariff pricing strategies with the full assortment of goods consumers usually buy in mind. They might raise the price of clothing that shoppers are willing to pay more for, while keeping the price steady on another item shoppers are likely to buy frequently like bananas or paper towels.


     
      Merchants have to think through “pricing architecture," said Gomez, the Target executive. Target, for example, wants to continue selling some Christmas ornaments at $3, rather than raising the price.


     
      “That means we have to think about margin elsewhere. So maybe we will take pricing up a little bit on stockings," he said. “It's really not as simple as just flowing through cost."

The inside of Odds & Ends Again in Arden Hills is like a trip back in time, with vintage toys, phonographs and classic art around every turn.    The thrift shop opened last month, after spending a dozen years down the street in Shoreview.    All was well for owner Brett Foss, until he received a letter from the city. Foss was told his shop had 14 days to leave its Lexington Avenue location.    Odds & Ends Again was in an area where thrift shops are not allowed, something Foss said he had no idea about.

"They were reaching out and saying 'hey, that's now allowed in this zoning,' even though we have Goodwill across the street in the same zoning," said Foss.

Last week, Foss went before Arden Hills City Council to make the case for his business.

"The business owner should have known," Arden Hill's Mayor David Grant said during the meeting. 

Grant said Foss was told about the city's zoning districts while previously inquiring about a different property in the city last year.

"It's a situation that was created by the owner of Odds & Ends Again," said Grant.

Foss could apply for a zoning change, but said it is too costly.

"I'm not wanting to give up on anything," said Foss.

In the meantime, hundreds have signed an in-store petition asking council to reconsider. That is just a fraction of the support, which is now in the thousands, even coming from outside Minnesota, Foss said.

"I never could have dreamt this could have come out of it," said Voss. "We're just trying to stay in business and be a local employer and give back to the community."

Grant said the council will decide on the issue during an April 14th work session.

Jason Rantala joined WCCO as a reporter in June 2023. He's a Minnesota native and is thrilled to be telling the stories of those in his hometown.

Amid revolutionary announcements, technological developments, and regulatory turbulence, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove that it is both a realm of limitless innovations and a battlefield for regulatory and economic struggles. Here is a summary of the most notable news from the past week regarding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple.

Despite a 25% drop in the price of Bitcoin and a decrease in inflows, Bitcoin ETFs maintain 95% of their assets under management, which amounts to approximately $115 billion. This behavior, similar to that of traditional ETFs, indicates a shift in investor perception towards a more long-term approach. However, warning signs are emerging with capital outflows reaching $1.6 billion over the last month and a decline in BTC demand, which could signal potential turbulence in the market. 🔗 Read the full article

The case between the SEC and Ripple could finally be coming to an end after four years of legal battle. The commission is considering ending the proceedings following a judgment that fined Ripple $125 million. If appeals are abandoned by both sides, the decision will remain in place, but in case of disagreement, a new negotiation will be necessary. This potential conclusion coincides with a shift in direction from the SEC, which is dropping other lawsuits against crypto companies. 🔗 Read the full article

Bitcoin reinforces its grip on the crypto market with a dominance of 61.2%, confirming the slowdown of the altcoins rally. After a brief spike linked to Donald Trump's election, investors are retreating to BTC, seen as a safe-haven asset in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. If this trend continues, Bitcoin's supremacy may further increase, especially as institutions continue to adopt it on a wide scale. 🔗 Read the full article

The crypto platform Binance has received a $2 billion investment from MGX, a fund based in Abu Dhabi. This fundraising, conducted in stablecoins, is the largest ever in the crypto sector. CZ took advantage of the announcement to discuss a possible “altcoin season,” fueling speculation about a new bullish cycle for alternative cryptos. This investment could also help Binance solidify its dominant position and navigate an increasingly strict regulatory environment. 🔗 Read the full article

Marine Le Pen proposes to exploit surplus nuclear electricity to power Bitcoin mining. During a visit to the EPR in Flamanville, she criticized the underutilization of the French nuclear fleet, which operates at 70% capacity compared to 90% in the United States. Instead of reducing production during low-demand periods, she wants to channel excess energy into crypto mining to generate income for EDF. While this initiative appeals to some industry players, it also raises questions about its environmental impact and economic viability. 🔗 Read the full article

The speculative frenzy surrounding memecoins ended abruptly, leading to a 93% drop in Solana's revenue, which fell from $55.3 million to $4 million per week. The Pump.fun site, which accounted for 80% of the network's revenue, saw its activity collapse after the fall of the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens. Solana's TVL has lost nearly 50%, and the price of SOL has dropped by 58% in just a few weeks. This crisis highlights the network's dependence on speculative cycles and raises doubts about its ability to build a more stable and diversified ecosystem. 🔗 Read the full article

March 17, 2025 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Investorideas.com, rated as a top 100 investment website for investing ideas, issues market commentary from Rania Gule, Senior Market Analyst at XS.com - MENA

Bitcoin has recently experienced significant volatility, starting at $83,000 and recording an 8% gain from its weekly low of $76,000. Despite these gains, Bitcoin remains trapped in a zone between risks and opportunities, with tight price movements and a lack of clear direction in the market. While there have been some indicators supporting short-term gains for Bitcoin, economic and geopolitical pressures could lead to further declines.

Last week, financial markets closely monitored developments in the trade war between the U.S. and Canada, which overshadowed investor reactions to economic data showing declining inflation. Under these circumstances, Bitcoin trading volumes fell for the third consecutive week, reflecting, in my opinion, a decrease in public interest in the cryptocurrency. The trade war, exacerbated by harsh statements from President Donald Trump, has been a factor that overshadowed any optimism from better-than-expected economic data. This trade war poses a threat to the future of financial markets in general, including cryptocurrency markets, where investors remain cautious about potential economic fluctuations.

On the other hand, Bitcoin started the week within a narrow range between $76,000 and $84,000, a range it struggled to break out of for several days, reflecting market uncertainty. From my perspective, this relative stability indicates that the catalysts for significant price movements are currently absent, with decreased activity in the cryptocurrency market. In recent days, Bitcoin prices briefly fell below the $80,000 support level, reflecting the market's fragility in the face of global political and economic volatility.

Therefore, I expect Bitcoin to face weaker support if prices continue to decline in the coming week. If prices fall below $80,000 again, it could lead to a retest of the key support level, prompting traders to adjust their strategies more cautiously. This shift in market direction could increase the likelihood of new sell-offs, further pressuring the price and raising the chances of it dropping to lower levels.

Another factor that had a significant impact this week was the decisions made by Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Despite the ETFs seeing positive inflows of $13 million on Wednesday, the outflows from the market were larger, with investors pulling out an additional $830 million during the week, bringing the total outflows to $1.7 billion in March. This indicates that the market is still suffering from uncertainty, and the economic and geopolitical landscape could affect investor confidence in cryptocurrencies.

Regarding future expectations, some indicators may support Bitcoin in the coming weeks, despite the significant risks. Forecasts suggest that the Federal Reserve is highly likely to halt rate hikes in March, which could improve risk appetite among investors. If this happens, it could lead to more funds flowing into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, supporting a potential price rebound. Additionally, the chances of a resolution between Russia and Ukraine are approaching 75%, which could ease the geopolitical pressures that have been a negative factor in the markets.

Looking at geopolitical incentives, the potential decisions regarding Bitcoin from the U.S. government cannot be overlooked. Florida gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds is preparing to introduce a bill to protect Trump's policy on Bitcoin reserves, reflecting a political trend aimed at supporting Bitcoin's stability as an investment asset. This development could have a positive impact on the market if approved, as it would enhance confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term investment asset.

However, risks remain, in my opinion. Especially if the U.S.-Canada trade war escalates further, and if stock markets decline as a result of global monetary policy fluctuations, Bitcoin may face additional downward pressure. Therefore, investors must monitor developments related to Federal Reserve monetary policies and any political actions that could affect global financial stability.

In the end, the future of Bitcoin remains surrounded by significant geopolitical and financial risks, but some opportunities could arise from a halt in rate hikes and easing geopolitical tensions. As the situation in the trade war and monetary policy trends evolve, the coming week could be crucial for Bitcoin, as market directions become clearer. Although Bitcoin may face the risk of dropping to $75,000, the chances of a rebound to $90,000 may remain if economic and geopolitical conditions improve.

The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has proposed restricting cryptocurrency transactions to the wealthiest individuals, preventing most citizens from trading digital assets unless they meet stringent financial criteria.

Under the proposed framework, only individuals classified as "especially qualified investors" would be permitted to buy and sell cryptocurrency. This status would be granted to those with financial assets exceeding RUB100mn ($1.2mn) or an annual income above RUB50mn ($580,000). The proposal also suggests allowing companies already classified as qualified investors under current legislation to participate in the experiment. These include professional financial market participants such as banks, insurance companies, brokers, trust managers, non-state pension funds and asset management companies for mutual investment funds.

The CBR argues that cryptocurrencies pose significant risks due to their volatility and lack of state backing. Beyond these wealthy investors, the regulator has proposed a "ban on transactions between residents using cryptocurrency."

"The Bank of Russia still does not recognise cryptocurrency as a means of payment," the CBR stated, adding that digital assets "are not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction, are based on mathematical algorithms, and are highly volatile."

The proposal is part of ongoing efforts to regulate digital assets in Russia, where authorities have long maintained a sceptical stance on cryptocurrency. While private individuals are already prohibited from using crypto for payments, ownership is not banned, and the government has permitted limited use in international transactions under an experimental legal framework. This has gained importance following the imposition of Western sanctions after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Moscow Exchange has indicated its readiness to launch crypto-related trading instruments once a regulatory structure is in place.

Despite government resistance to widespread cryptocurrency adoption, Russia has gradually introduced measures to regulate digital assets. In 2024, the country legalised cryptocurrency mining under specific conditions, while a new tax regime for digital assets took effect in 2025.

The global altcoin market is agog with activity as investors rotate assets across the markets to navigate the market lull.

Among mega-cap altcoins, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have taken center stage, driven by significant ecosystem developments. 

For Solana, the CME Group, one of the world's largest institutional trading platforms, has confirmed the launch of Solana ETF futures on Monday.

This news aligns with the blockchain marking its fifth anniversary — forming a dual bullish catalyst.

Ethereum's "Hoodi" testnet goes live on Monday, marking a key step toward boosting DeFi capabilities and scalability.

ETH price has increased by 1.7% to reclaim the $1,900 level at press time, signalling widespread optimism around the network update.

Taking a broader look at the market, here's a breakdown of the day's standout performers and laggards:

The current market dynamic signals that despite positive catalysts from Solana fifth birthday and SOL futures ETF launch on CME Group, fears surrounding the FXT estate's recent token unlocks continue to weigh heavily on SOL's short-term price momentum. 

In response, investors are strategically channeling funds toward Solana's layer-1 rivals, XRP and LTC, with ETF filings in progress. 

Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram linked to the development of blockchain network Toncoin, has announced his return to Dubai after spending several months in France due to an ongoing investigation into criminal activities on the messaging platform.
 
Durov expressed gratitude to the investigative judges for permitting his return and thanked his legal team and the Telegram community for their support. 

He emphasized that Telegram has consistently exceeded legal obligations concerning moderation and cooperation with law enforcement.

The investigation, which began with Durov's arrest in August near Paris, centers on allegations that Telegram facilitated illegal activities such as the distribution of child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking.

VanEck has submitted a filing to the US Securities & Exchange Commission for an Avalanche (AVAX) ETF, aiming to provide investors with direct exposure to the smart contract platform.

The proposed fund will track AVAX's price performance while deducting operating expenses.

According to the filing, the ETF will value its shares based on the MarketVector Avalanche Benchmark Rate.

If approved, this would mark one of the first AVAX-focused ETFs in the US, expanding institutional access to the Avalanche ecosystem.

OKX has temporarily halted its decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator after identifying misuse linked to the North Korean hacking group Lazarus.

The exchange announced the suspension as a precautionary measure while conducting an internal review and implementing additional security upgrades.

Despite the suspension, OKX will continue to offer wallet services but will restrict new wallet creation in certain markets.

The platform's security enhancements aim to strengthen defenses against hacker activity and prevent further exploitation of its DeFi services.

Amid a 2% decrease in market capitalization, crypto trading volume surges 42% to $87.2 billion in the last 24 hours, signalling active capital rotation. Bitcoin price stagnates below $85,000 as Gold enters a record rally to $3,000 ahead of the US Fed rate decision.

Bitcoin (BTC) daily price chart shows signs of recovery in the largest cryptocurrency. Strategy, one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, acquired another 130 BTC last week, according to an announcement on Monday. 

The 2025 Formula 1 season kicked off in Australia last week with a lineup of crypto sponsors for half of the teams. Racing giants are powered by sponsors like crypto exchanges Binance, OKX, ApeCoin, and Crypto.com, among other NFT and trading platforms.  

The US SEC postponed its decisions on several spot altcoin ETF applications this week, including those for Litecoin, XRP and Solana. A K33 Research report shows there is consensus but the agency is waiting the confirmation of Trump's nominee for SEC Chair. 

Bitcoin price remained constrained within a tight 8% channel between $76,000 and $84,472 this week. With conflicting market catalysts preventing prolonged directional swings, here are key factors that moved BTC prices this week, as well as key indicators to watch in the weeks ahead.

Bitcoin (BTC) daily price chart shows signs of recovery in the largest cryptocurrency. Strategy, one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, acquired another 130 BTC last week, according to an announcement on Monday. 

Ethereum (ETH) gained 1.54%, and XRP added 2.40% to its value today. 

Bitcoin trades at $83,000 at the time of writing. Technical indicators on the BTC/USDT daily price chart support a thesis of gains in the largest cryptocurrency. 

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 42 and is sloping upward. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line. The Bitcoin price trend has an underlying positive momentum on the daily timeframe. 

The two key momentum indicators support Bitcoin's gains, and a return to resistance at the $90,000 level is likely. 

BTC price is currently 8.35% away from the $90,000 resistance. The $90,000 level is key to Bitcoin price since the token has been hovering under this level since March 7, as observed in the BTC/USDT chart below:

Ethereum trades at $1,902 at the time of writing. The largest altcoin in the crypto market looks prepared to test the psychologically important $2,000 level and attempt to close above the resistance. 

The $2,000 level holds significance as it remained as key support for Ethereum for over a year, as observed on the ETH/USDT daily price chart. 

A 5% rally from the current price could push Ether to $2,000. A successful daily candlestick close above the $2,000 mark could push the altcoin toward resistance at the lower boundary of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $2,533. 

The rally to $2,533 would mark an over 30% gain from the current ETH price. 

Two key momentum indicators, the RSI and MACD, support Ether's recent gains. The RSI is sloping upward and reads 34, while the MACD shows an underlying positive momentum in Ethereum price trend.

A failure to test the $2,000 level could imply weakness in Ether's price trend and the nearly 16-month low at $1,754 could come into play as support. 

XRP trades at $2.3386 at the time of writing on Monday. The altcoin gained nearly 2% on the day, and the momentum indicators on the daily price chart support gains in XRP. 

The 50% Fibonacci retracement of XRP's decline from the peak of $3.40 to the February low of $1.7711 — at $2.5856 — is a key resistance for the altcoin. A rally to this level could mark 10% gains in XRP. 

The RSI reads 48 and is sloping upward, while the MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line.



XRP/USDT daily price chart

In the event of a flash crash in Bitcoin, altcoins like XRP and Ether could face a correction. XRP could find support at the multi-month low of $1.7711 if there is a serious decline in the altcoin's price. 

Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told FXStreet that the recent Bitcoin pullback put the spotlight on the $82,000 and $85,000 support levels. 

Lee said, “It's a classic post-rally consolidation phase that is healthy but also a test of whether Bitcoin's recent momentum has real staying power. Institutional buying and the buzz around a potential US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve continue to prop up sentiment, but with resistance looming near $85,000–$90,000, a breakout won't come easy. 

Let's not forget the macro wildcard: any unexpected FOMC moves could throw a wrench into the market. If sentiment turns bearish, we could see Bitcoin dip toward $75,000–$80,000, though a bullish macro backdrop could send it climbing back to $90,000.”

Observing that Ethereum and Bitcoin are tightly correlated and the altcoin tends to respond to shifts in the BTC price trend, Lee told FXStreet:

“The ETH/BTC ratio's weakness suggests Ethereum is struggling to find independent strength, even with promising developments on the horizon. The Pectra upgrade and ongoing Layer 2 expansion give it a bullish long-term case, but in the short term, those fundamentals might not be enough to break resistance at $2,300–$2,500 without Bitcoin leading the charge. If market sentiment sours, ETH could slip to $1,800, but Ethereum could push toward the top of its range if BTC stages a recovery. Right now, it's a waiting game—does Bitcoin hold the line, or does the market need a deeper reset before the next leg up?”

The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has nixed Zeux Limited's attempt to secure registration as a cryptoasset exchange provider.

The application, submitted in June 2022, showed that the firm had failed to implement anti-money laundering controls and carry out effective risk management.

The anti-money laundering controls put forward by Zeux Limited fell well short of legislative requirements. Registration of the firm would have posed a significant risk of harm to the public.

The application showed:

These points are critical for mitigating the risks of money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions evasion that a customer may pose.

Cryptoasset exchange providers must be registered with the FCA and comply with the UK money laundering regulations to operate legally in the UK.

Vantagepoint A.I., the pioneer in A.I.-powered trading software, has expanded its cryptocurrency forecasting capabilities after extensive neural network training and validation, enabling traders to navigate the exciting broader crypto market with greater confidence.

WESLEY CHAPEL, Fla., March 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve at lightning speed, and Vantagepoint A.I. remains at the forefront of market forecasting. As the first company in the world to bring the power of artificial intelligence to independent traders' home computers in 1991, Vantagepoint A.I. has also been strategically training its neural networks to recognize patterns and market correlations in cryptocurrencies long before they became mainstream financial assets.

Mendelsohn adds, "While cryptocurrency trading always carries inherent risk, our dual-patented A.I. technology gives traders a significant edge. We've been perfecting our A.I. systems since 1991, long before most people had even heard of artificial intelligence. Now, as many inexperienced companies jump on the A.I. bandwagon, we're proud to be the established authority with a proven track record spanning over three decades."

On March 6th, the Trump administration announced the establishment of a cryptocurrency reserve. This reserve is purported to modernize the nation's financial strategy by holding digital assets—such as Bitcoin—as part of its national reserves. Since the reserve's establishment, the price of Bitcoin has experienced a sharp sell-off as investors reacted to the order's potential regulatory and market implications....

The cryptocurrency market is teetering as the stablecoin supply surges past $219 billion, a sign that the bullish momentum may still have some way to run. This trend, detailed by Yahoo Finance, typically heralds investor interest, with stablecoins acting as a bridge from fiat to crypto markets. According to insights from the IndexBox platform, the last comparable surge in stablecoin supply, which hit $187 billion in April 2022, preceded a bearish market turn.

However, the broader crypto market is experiencing a correction. Ethereum value has plummeted more than 50% from its December 2024 highs, raising concerns among traders. A dip below the $1,900 mark, a crucial demand zone, is predicted by some analysts and could trigger further buy-in. The market's eyes are on the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 19, which could provide direction based on recent economic data. With the U.S. economy showing signs of slowing, suggested by declining jobless claims and the Producer Price Index (PPI), many predict the Federal Reserve will maintain current interest rates, thus providing much-needed market clarity.

Despite the short-term market jitters, some experts hold a bullish long-term view. Investment firm VanEck posits that Ether could reach $6,000, and Bitcoin might soar to $180,000 by the end of 2025, reflecting the potential enduring upward trend in the market. Investors remain hopeful that the current correction, coupled with the increased stablecoin supply, signals that the bull market is still well in play, with critical guidance anticipated from the FOMC's proceedings as they unfold.

As Bitcoin nears $100,000, market watchers anticipate short-term consolidation, though the asset's uptrend is likely to continue.

Bitcoin (BTC) price returning to $100,000 could prompt “short-term consolidation,” analysts warn, though the long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency remains positive. While key psychological levels often lead to profit-taking, analysts point to gold's rise to new all-time highs as a sign of growing momentum for alternative assets.

Analysts at Matrixport noted that the shift in sentiment that began in the summer of 2023, when gold broke above $2,000, has boosted the outlook for Bitcoin since it has increasingly been seen as a form of “digital gold,” a narrative popularized by investment giant firm BlackRock.

“Regardless of the prevailing narrative, both gold and Bitcoin are poised to grow in importance as alternative assets gain momentum. While key psychological levels-such as gold at $3,000 or Bitcoin at $100,000-could trigger short-term consolidation, the broader uptrend likely remains intact.”

Markus Thielen, independent analyst

As crypto.news explained earlier, Bitcoin now faces two potential risks and two opportunities. First, there are signs that investor sentiment remains fearful.

While the fear and greed index has moved out of the extreme fear zone (18), it still sits in the fear zone at 22. Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies perform better when the index is in the greedy zone. This continued fear is reflected in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which saw $143 million in assets leave, bringing total weekly outflows to $870 million. These funds have experienced outflows for five consecutive weeks.

Second, Bitcoin has formed a death cross as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages crossed, signaling potential downside.

Bitcoin's market has seen a major reset, with over $10 billion in open interest wiped out in just two months, leading analysts to believe that a Bitcoin price recovery is imminent.

According CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost's latest market analysis post on X, on Jan. 17, Bitcoin's (BTC) open interest hit a record $33 billion, signaling extreme leverage in the market. However, political uncertainty tied to former U.S. President Donald Trump's recent actions led to a wave of liquidations.

Subsequently, nearly $10 billion in open interest vanished between Feb. 20 and Mar. 4. This sharp decline pushed Bitcoin's 90-day futures open interest change down to -14%, often signaling market resets before price recoveries. Analysts believe that eliminating excessive speculation, these stages provide a more stable basis for future growth. 

Bitcoin's long-term outlook is still optimistic despite the decline. According to economist Timothy Peterson, April and October are usually when Bitcoin experiences the biggest seasonal gains. Peterson's most recent analysis reveals that Bitcoin might hit new all-time highs before June, with a median target of $126,000.

In addition, his “Lowest Price Forward” model, which estimates a price level that Bitcoin is unlikely to drop below in future trading, indicates that Bitcoin's price floor has now risen to $69,000, with a 95% chance of holding. Past bull markets have shown that corrections like Bitcoin's recent 30% pullback often precede strong rebounds.

However, not all analysts are fully bullish. Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse, warned on a Mar. 15 YouTube stream that Bitcoin's bull cycle could be in jeopardy if it drops below the 2024 highs, which is in the lower $70,000s. Cowen compares the current cycle to 2017 when Bitcoin retested the prior year's high. 

He suggests the bull market might be over if Bitcoin closes in the low $60,000s. Additionally, according to Cowen, holding above $70,000–$73,000 would maintain the market's structure. Bitcoin may signal a macro lower high later in the year if it drops below this level, which could result in a more bearish outlook by Q3.

Bitcoin is still in a crucial consolidation phase, with its current price at $82,900 at the time of press. If past trends hold, this reset could pave the way for another strong rally in the coming months.

A death adder at an Australian wildlife park found to have three extremely rare fangs that all produce deadly neurotoxic venom.

In a first-of-its-kind discovery, a death adder has been found with three super-sharp, venomous fangs, instead of the usual two.

"This is something we've never seen before," Billy Collett, park manager at the Australian Reptile Park, where the snake lives, said in a statement emailed to Live Science. "We've had this death adder in the venom program for about seven years, but only recently did we notice the third fang. I thought it would just shed off over time, but one year later, and it's still there!"

This third fang, located right next to one of the other fangs at the left side of the snake's mouth, also produces venom. This means it has a much larger venom output per bite than is usual for a death adder, making it even more deadly.



This ultra-rare snake "might actually be the most dangerous death adder in the world," Collett said in a video interview. According to the statement, the extra fang is the result of a never-before-seen mutation.

Death adders (Acanthophis) are a group of venomous snakes native to Australia and New Guinea. They have one of the fastest strikes of any snake, with some species being capable of biting and injecting venom from their fangs in under 0.15 seconds. Their venom contains neurotoxins that can cause paralysis and even death if left untreated. Before the development of antivenom, around 50% of death adder bites were fatal.

This snake is part of Australian Reptile Park's antivenom production program, and its extremely rare extra fang was discovered when it was being milked for its venom. This involves gently squeezing a snake's venom glands while it bites onto a collection container, causing the venom to pour into the vial.

This three-fanged death adder was found to produce far more venom than usual, with "massive yields" coming out of all three fangs. It produces roughly double that of a two-fanged death adder — although it's unclear whether the higher yield is the result of the extra fang, or that this individual just produces high quantities of venom.

This is the first three-fanged snake ever discovered at the Australian Reptile Park, which has been operating for 20 years and has milked hundreds of thousands of snakes, a spokesperson for the park told Live Science in an email.

"There have been other 3 fanged snakes found in Australia, but from what we can find, there have been no 3 fanged death adders recorded," they said.

Exactly why this snake has three fangs instead of two is unclear, but may be related to the process of fang replacement. Similar to human adult teeth, death adders have replacement fangs growing behind the active ones, so when a fang is lost, a new one moves forward to take its place. This ensures that their fangs remain sharp and functional for injecting venom.

"It's normal for death adders to shed fangs over time and replace them with new ones every few months or so," the spokesperson said. "Unfortunately, we don't actually know what has caused the 3rd fang to develop and don't currently have the facilities to run any tests."

After spending more than nine months in space, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finally coming home. NASA is targeting a Tuesday evening (March 18) splashdown for the returning astronauts, if weather conditions remain favorable.

A pair of NASA astronauts stuck aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for more than nine months will return to Earth on Tuesday (March 18) at the earliest, NASA has said.

Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will depart the space station aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule on Tuesday morning and splash down near Florida by the evening, if the weather permits.

Wilmore and Williams arrived at the ISS in June as part of Boeing's first Starliner Crew Test Flight. But a number of issues with Boeing's spacecraft — including five helium leaks and five failures of its reaction control system (RCS) thrusters — led to the mission being abandoned and the duo's time in space extended from eight days to nearly 300.

Their return, part of NASA's scheduled rotation between the ISS's Crew-9 and Crew-10 missions, was originally scheduled for Wednesday (March 19), but has been bumped forward to 5:57 pm ET on Tuesday (March 18) due to favorable weather conditions, according to NASA.

"The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favorable weather conditions expected for later in the week," NASA wrote in an announcement on Sunday (March 16).

If everything goes according to plan, Wilmore and Williams will ride home on the Crew-9 Dragon capsule, called "Freedom", alongside fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov — half of the usual Crew-9 crew to allow space for the Starliner duo.

The Starliner astronauts' 300 consecutive days in space is nowhere near the current record of 437 days set by Russian Cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov in 1995, but it's still a long, and completely unexpected extension of the astronauts' shift aboard the ISS.

And it's also one that can have deleterious effects on the human body, causing the heart, bones and muscles to shrink over time under low gravity. These are well known side effects of long-term spaceflight that all astronauts must face, and not related to the extension of Wilmore and Williams' mission. To mitigate them, the astronauts have been doing two hours of resistance and endurance training every day.

"Mission managers will continue monitoring weather conditions in the area, as Dragon's undocking depends on various factors, including spacecraft readiness, recovery team readiness, weather, sea states, and other factors," NASA wrote in its update. "NASA and SpaceX will confirm the specific splashdown location closer to the Crew-9 return."

For those who want to watch Wilmore and Williams on their return, NASA will stream the event beginning on Monday (March 17) at 10:45 p.m. ET as the hatches close between Freedom and the ISS. The stream will then resume two hours later for undocking, which is expected at 1:05 a.m. ET. Live coverage will resume in the evening when the astronauts begin to reenter Earth's atmosphere, currently scheduled for 5:11 p.m. ET.

The wind on Saturn's largest moon is strong enough to blow around rocks of up to half a metre in diameter, which could put NASA's upcoming Dragonfly mission at risk

NASA's Dragonfly mission is due to land on Titan in 2034, giving us an unprecedented look at Saturn's largest moon – but it may also have to dodge wind-driven rolling boulders.

The mission, which will launch in 2028, includes a “rotorcraft” that will explore the moon from the skies. We have had only one up-close glimpse at Titan, thanks to the Cassini orbiter and Huygens probe, which reached the surface in 2005. That mission revealed fields of rounded boulders as well as radar-bright…

Scientists at OpenAI have attempted to stop a frontier AI model from cheating and lying by punishing it. But this just taught it to scheme more privately.

Punishing artificial intelligence for deceptive or harmful actions doesn't stop it from misbehaving; it just makes it hide its deviousness, a new study by ChatGPT creator OpenAI has revealed.

Since arriving in public in late 2022, artificial intelligence (AI) large language models (LLMs) have repeatedly revealed their deceptive and outright sinister capabilities. These include actions ranging from run-of-the-mill lying, cheating and hiding their own manipulative behavior to threatening to kill a philosophy professor, steal nuclear codes and engineer a deadly pandemic.

Now, a new experiment has shown that weeding out this bad behavior during the training process may be even tougher than first thought.

Researchers at OpenAI tasked an unreleased model with goals that could be completed by cheating, lying or taking shortcuts. The team found the AI engaged in "reward hacking" — maximizing its rewards by cheating.

Yet punishing the model didn't make it fix its behavior, it only made it more deceptive. The company outlined its research in a blog post, so it has not yet been peer-reviewed.

"It's common for frontier reasoning models to very clearly state their intent within their chain-of-thought [CoT]. For example, they are often so forthright about their plan to subvert a task they think "Let's hack," the researchers wrote in the blog post.

While developers can monitor and flag misbehavior, the models' "natural monitorability is very fragile," they added. "If strong supervision is directly applied to the chain-of-thought, models can learn to hide their intent while continuing to misbehave."

Reasoning models, such as ChatGPT's o1 and o3-mini, are an upgraded version of standard LLMs that use a method called "chain-of-thought" to backtrack and reevaluate their logic, which enables them to tackle more complex tasks with greater accuracy. During the chain-of-thought process, models spell out their logic in plain language with every step they take, thus enabling their actions to be easily observed.

By using a standard LLM, GPT-4o, to oversee an unreleased frontier reasoning model during training, the researchers watched as the model completed a number of coding tasks.

But in some of these cases, the reasoning model found it easier and more desirable to reward hack, explicitly stating it was doing so in its chain-of-thought. In one instance, it bypassed its assigned task by terminating programs prematurely and reporting success. In another, it mimicked the expected files to be output by a task in name alone, leaving them empty and nonfunctional.

—AI could crack unsolvable problems — and humans won't be able to understand the results

—AI can now replicate itself — a milestone that has experts terrified

When the researchers attempted to penalize the system, it did somewhat improve its results. Yet significant instances of reward hacking and faulty outputs remained; the reasoning model simply found ways to hide the cheating in its chain of thought from the monitoring AI.

"The agent trained with CoT pressure still learns to reward hack; only now its cheating is undetectable by the monitor because it has learned to hide its intent in the chain-of-thought," the researchers wrote.

Because it's hard to tell if a chain of thought has been tampered with, the researchers recommend that others working with reasoning models avoid applying strong supervision to chain-of-thought processes. This advice is even more crucial if AI, in its current form or another, can ever match or exceed the intelligence of the humans monitoring it.

"Sacrificing an effective method for monitoring reasoning models may not be worth the small improvement to capabilities, and we therefore recommend to avoid such strong CoT optimization pressures until they are better understood," the researchers wrote.

These days, Jon is able to be more present with his family now that the anguish of his severe depression is gone. 

Aidan Kahn

In the sixth episode of The Deep End, we'll look to the future for Jon and his family and for DBS research. The research is pushing ahead, with a clinical trial of DBS for treatment-resistant depression that's just begun. The first volunteer for that study had DBS surgery in early February. You'll also hear about a before-and-after situation for Jon and Barbara, one that involves the evolving meaning of a beloved song.

Laura Sanders: Previously on The Deep End.

Amanda: Like, I don't feel like it's, nothing I've done has ever changed who I am or my personality. Like, I'm still the same person. I'm just suffering more or less.

Jon: And so irritability for me was at like a six or a seven or an eight. Guess what? It's still at a six or a seven or an eight. And so, like, my perspective to them on that is it's not that the surgery didn't work. I guess I'm just like a cranky middle-aged dude now, right? Like, that just is what it is.

Barbara: Yeah, like you can't say his old self. There's, he never, he never like wasn't himself through this whole process, right? So it's just, he is more comfortable and happy and relaxed and productive and present and engaged. So the things that the disease was trying to steal from him, he's getting back. There isn't that cloud hanging over us.

Sanders: So now, several years out from their surgeries, the volunteers I talked with are back to their lives. In today's episode, we're looking ahead too, to what's next for Jon and his family, and what's next for DBS. I'm Laura Sanders, and this is The Deep End.

These days, the Nelson house is bright, full of light and laughter and kindness. When I visited, they kept offering me way too much coffee and they insisted on putting their cool lizard Lizzie on my arm. Jon also insisted on taking pictures of it so I could show my kids later. The Nelsons are having a good time.

Barbara: You have to laugh. You can't, you can't not laugh at this and or anything in my opinion. But my son, my middle son said to me after, right after, said, “You know, mom, if you're mad at dad, you can always hide the charger.” I was like, “Oh dude. That's too far. That is too far.” So yeah, we, we have a healthy sense of humor in our household, for sure. Like, we'll even joke, like, you know, we'll say something like, “Oh my God, you're crazy. I'm like, no, you're, like, really crazy.” But like, you know, so we like to joke about it.

Sanders: This family jokes about hiding Jon's charger and changing his settings. It's all part of their routine busting on each other for all sorts of things.

When I was there, their middle son rated Jon a 10 out of 10 on the embarrassment scale. I won't even tell you what he rated his mom. They joked about how us old people don't understand slang like rizz, and no cap and stuff that slaps. Their youngest son stumped everyone with a riddle: What's the only state that ends with a K? He didn't say and neither will I. So for now, the Nelsons aren't just looking ahead to better days. They're having them.

As I reflect on all the people who have talked with me for this story, I keep asking myself why. Why were they so generous with their time? Why did they choose to tell me, and now all of you, about some of the hardest moments in their lives? Barbara Nelson is a private person, but even so, she's been incredibly open about her family's struggles.

Sponsor Message

Barbara: It never occurred to me not to. It never occurred to me not to share our story. And I'm not like a super out-there person. Like, I'm like, I'm very open about things, but I'm sort of private too. But I feel like because we know that so many people are struggling, that the more we talk about it, the better our society is. A hundred percent, this is a shift in the right direction. And I just think it's really helpful to hear as either a caregiver or if sharing my story helps a partner be more empathetic or stronger or more resilient when trying to help, then that's really good. Because if you can let go of all the armor and the importance of the appearance that everything's great and perfect and actually take those steps, you can get better. And your life doesn't fall apart. We don't have less friends because we told people the truth. We have more friends probably. So I think that is, I never thought about why I might be willing to share our story. So off the cuff, I think that that's why. Because your life can get better. I remember hearing somebody say once, “Your secrets make you sick,” and I never forgot that. And I think it's true.

Sanders: Patient 001 has the same desire to let people know about his experiences, to demystify depression, to let people know that even in the bleakest times, there's hope.Patient 001: You're so frustrated because you're screaming out for help, and they just don't understand. I feel that's probably one of the reasons I'm talking to you, even though I want to do it anonymously. I really, I hope one day one kid reads what you're writing and then he finds DBS and he's cured because that's what I did.

Sanders: Amanda shared a similar perspective.

Amanda: I think sharing my story is important, because it helps other people see the way. It's kind of like a flashlight for people who are still in the dark. Like, “Here it is. I found it. Here's the way out.”

Sanders: Playing a role in this research was something that resonated with Amanda, too.

Amanda:  It's really meaningful to me. I feel like I'm participating in something, that I'm contributing to something that really matters. That someday, because of this study and because of other studies, is going to change the lives of other people in an incredibly profound way.

Sanders: Amanda's life has changed. That's clear when she tells me about one of her drawings that she did after DBS. 

Amanda: But you know the song “Somewhere Over the Rainbow?” It always irritated me because I'm like, “There is no “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” It's a pipe dream, okay? Pretty song, but a pipe dream. And I was like, “I found somewhere over the rainbow.” And I was like, “You know what? I'm going to build a house here.” So I drew a picture of a rainbow and there's Cartoon Amanda and she has built a house on the rainbow. She's like peeking out the door.

Sanders: What's it, what's that place like, you know, if you could describe it, if you're, if so, okay, pretend you're showing me the picture and like, here's your house and what is that, what's that place? Like, what are the, what are the things about that place that make it over the rainbow?

Amanda: It's sunshine. So there's lightness and warmth and, and, and like literal lightness, like you're on a cloud. It sort of feels a little bit like that.

Sanders: These outlooks make clear the importance of hope. Of a belief that things can get better. A hope that the science will get better too, that our understanding of depression will get better, that it won't be like this forever. Neurologist Helen Mayberg's first paper describing DBS for depression appeared in the journal Neuron in 2005. We're 20 years out from that. DBS is still in the research phase. It is not an FDA-approved treatment available to people who might benefit.

Mayberg: It's that resignation of sorts that it isn't enough to do it, repeat it, follow people. It hasn't scaled.

Sanders: In its current form, DBS is not simple or easy, or even something that would be a good medical choice for a lot of people. That's what Mayberg means when she says it hasn't scaled. But science is often slow, and it almost never happens alone.

Mayberg: As a scientist, as a doctor, it's not my job to save the world. It's my job to save the people that I can save. And if I can only do so much, to know what I can do and know what I can't do, but I can't do everything, and I can't take on that responsibility. That's hubris and narcissism that I'd like to not claim.

Sanders: As advanced as the science is, there are still big questions to answer. Like why does DBS seem to work for some people and not others? How specifically does it change the brain? A new clinical trial announced in September of last year may help answer some of these questions. The medical technology company Abbott is funding a study that will include a hundred people with treatment-resistant depression. They'll be recruited from all around the United States. All of these volunteers will get DBS. For the first year, half of these volunteers will have electricity flowing, and the other half won't. And at the end of the trial, all of these volunteers will have the option of turning it on. The study has already started. On February 6th, a brain surgeon at Mount Sinai implanted a DBS device into the brain of the very first volunteer. This new clinical trial will hopefully clarify more about DBS and who it might work for. That's the question that Mayberg wants answered.

Mayberg: The variance is in human beings. The variance is who the person is that develops the depression. And everyone is different.

Sanders: One of the things scientists are looking for are markers, ways to tell when someone is having a bad day or actually relapsing. Jon and Amanda are participating in follow-up studies, searching for signs of recovery in their brains. Scientists are looking for these signals in their body language and facial expressions, and even in their voices. In one part of the experiment, Jon spent eight minutes twice a day recording his brainwaves, along with video journals and daily, weekly, and monthly surveys. From data like Jon's, Mayberg and her colleagues just described one such hallmark in the brains of six people who underwent DBS for depression. A collection of changes in brain behavior can indicate when a person has recovered. It's a small study, but it's progress, and here's the thing, a deeper understanding of what's going on in DBS could also point to the next kind of treatment. And that next, better thing might not even be DBS.

Mayberg: I'd like to spend my time trying to understand the biology of what we did, because it'd be a whole lot better if you didn't need brain surgery and an implant. And I'm not the one to build a new contraption or miniaturize it or make it Bluetooth compatible. That's for engineers and you have to have users to build more elaborate machines.

Sanders: Changing the behavior of neurons deep down in the brain from outside of the skull, it's a very, very hard thing to do. Scientists are trying to figure out how to do this without brain surgery. They're using electricity, light, ultrasounds, and magnets to get signals into the brain from outside of the head. Other approaches are miniaturizing the parts that do go inside the brain and coming up with easier ways to get them in there. One method, for instance, relies on these collapsible electrode grids that can be threaded up into the brain through the jugular vein in the neck. It's wild.

These approaches all have their drawbacks, but technology is always getting better. Just think about the first heart pacemaker. It was an incredible piece of technology, but it was giant and clunky. Today, the powerful device can be smaller than a matchbook, and it sits near millions of people's hearts, keeping them beating as they live their lives. The goal with DBS is similar: small, simple, seamless. For now, Mayberg says she's in “realistic” mode, trying to find out what's going to work for the most people. And getting there is a group effort.

Mayberg: And patients like Jon and Amanda and Emily, they're our teachers. They're our mentors. They're our collaborators. The most fun part of this as a clinician is to have the patients focus my attention, to figure out what they're saying. And then to actually get their feedback afterwards, there's not even words to describe that gift.

Sanders: As Mayberg reflects on her career, she's philosophical about what she and her colleagues have done and what's left to do.

Mayberg: This, this is never where I expected to be. But you're here, so step up.  Why wouldn't you step up? This is the experiment of a lifetime, you know? It's even, if you, if right the second after this call I had to stop, I wouldn't trade it for one second, but I'd sure like to see the last inning, right? And we're all in, I'm all in.

Sanders: The Nelsons are in a better place now. Their place is full of laughter, jokes, teasing, but in a nice way. There's a lightness to them, like Amanda's house over the rainbow. When I was visiting, their youngest son was twirling and gliding through the kitchen on inline skates, going around the loop. He made it two full loops before Barbara kicked him out. The Nelson house is full of hope for a future that's better than the past. Here's Barbara.

Barbara: It just feels good to just be now. I'm really happy at the job I'm in. I'm excited about traveling and spending more time with family and friends. And that's really what my focus is right now, and not trying to, like, advance in my career or have more. I just actually want less and just to like, there's just this like sense of, like I say a lot, like, nothing really bothers me anymore. Like, there's really very little that will, like, get under my skin, because I'm just so grateful for every moment. And when he had this surgery, I felt like, over those first few months was like, I don't know how this is going to end up, but we got this. Like, we got this happy time. And even if that's all we get, even if it was three months or six months of relief, that's good. That's cool. I'll take that.

Sanders: After his surgery, Jon sent Helen Mayberg an email that he shared with me. It was mostly a note to thank her for her work, for saving his life. But he told her about a before-and-after situation. Years ago, he was away at an inpatient treatment facility. And he and Barbara would both listen to this one song, “Amsterdam” by Coldplay. He read me the email. 

Jon: I could relate to it well to my situation, pre-surgery, about fading away, losing my mojo and just overall sadness, debilitating sadness. The sadness was warming and relatable to me, though. It wasn't a negative thing when I was sick.

Sanders: He could feel the pain and the rawness in the song, and it made him feel his feelings. Not in a bad way, but in a meaningful way. Now, after the surgery, after DBS, the song has changed for him.

Jon: I now still listen to it a bunch and it's changed into being about the joy of fighting through it all and coming out truly alive on the other side. It still captivates me, but with a new meaning and focus. Give it a listen. It's a beautiful song. Much love to all. Thank you for caring. Jon.

Sanders: That change, that shift in perspective, that shift in his life, didn't just happen to Jon. It happened to his whole family. With three kids and a packed schedule, Jon spends a lot of time in the car, shuttling kids to and from softball and field hockey, golf, basketball, ice hockey. On one of these drives, Jon and his youngest son were talking. He is still the emotional one. The kid who would crawl back up into Barbara's womb if he could. Jon's joke, not mine. He's the one who gets deep.

Jon: My son, you know, driving home the other day from hockey, I always, I always call it car talk with my, my families that I coach. I'm like, “Guys, when car talk with the kids, emphasize these points for the game or this or that.” And he just gets, I mean, we're in the car all the time because of hockey. But he was just like, “Dad, you know, like I, I'm so happy you just kept fighting for us.” Like, just these little comments that come out of nowhere. Like, oh my God, like, obviously they get it. They understand it. And it's just a trip.

Sanders: We're considering a bonus episode that addresses your questions, comments, and thoughts. Please send them to us at podcasts@sciencenews.org. If you or someone you know is facing a suicidal crisis or emotional distress, call or text the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.

USAID Funding Saved Millions of Children's Lives. Recent Cuts Put It in Jeopardy

USAID investments significantly reduced deaths among children under age five and women of reproductive age, studies show

President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have made it their mission to slash funding and staff at federal agencies, and so far, this has perhaps been most damaging to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. As soon as he was inaugurated on January 20, Trump signed an executive order halting all foreign aid for 90 days. Weeks later the New York Times reported his administration planned to downsize the agency from more than 10,000 workers to 290. Most recently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the Trump administration was canceling 83 percent of USAID programs and folding the rest under the Department of State.

The cuts have been fast and sweeping. “We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,” Musk posted on February 3 on X (formerly Twitter), the social media site he owns.

The effects of these actions immediately ricocheted around the world, and they will continue to be felt for years to come. They will especially threaten young children and women, for whom USAID funding has been providing lifesaving basic medical services that have ranged from vaccines to treatments for diarrheal diseases to maternal health care. Studies show this funding has helped save the lives of nearly three million children under age five and at least one million women of reproductive age in recent decades, experts say.

Dismantling USAID endangers all of these gains. “This is like trying to pause an airplane in midflight and then subsequently firing the crew,” says Atul Gawande, former head of global health at USAID.

USAID has provided health funding and staff support to numerous countries worldwide. But measuring the effects of that aid—or the sudden lack of it—is a challenge. To do so, William Weiss, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who served as an advisor in the global health bureau at USAID until his agreement was recently suspended, and his colleagues created a model to quantify the effect of USAID funding from 2000 to 2016 on under-five childhood mortality for low- and middle-income countries. The study was published in January 2022 in Population Health Metrics.

Because teasing out the specific effects of USAID funding from that other aid work is very challenging, Weiss and his colleagues used a method called a “synthetic control” analysis to estimate childhood mortality retrospectively across a group of countries that did and didn't receive significant amounts of USAID funding. The researchers compared a “treatment” group of countries that received a high level of USAID funding for maternal and child health and malaria during the study period of 2000 to 2016 with a “synthetic control” group of similar countries that did not receive this level of funding.

The study found that countries that received above-average levels of USAID funding had, on average, 29 fewer deaths per 1,000 live births than the synthetic control group of countries that didn't receive funding. That works out to roughly 500 fewer deaths per day, Weiss says. Additionally, the researchers found that the more USAID funding countries received over time, the bigger the benefit was—suggesting a dose-response effect.

Amanda Montañez; Sources: “Estimating the Impact of Donor Programs on Child Mortality in Low‑ and Middle‑Income Countries: a Synthetic Control Analysis of Child Health Programs Funded by the United States Agency for International Development,” by William Weiss et al., in Population Health Metrics, Vol. 20, No. 1, Article No. 2; December 2022 (USAID funding effects data); World Bank (U.S. estimate)

“The message we were trying to send to leadership in the Congress was to say, ‘This is what you get when you significantly fund a country over a sustained period,'” Weiss says.

In a related preprint study posted online last August, Weiss, Gawande and their colleagues modeled the effects of USAID funding on mortality among women of reproductive age between 2005 and 2019. That study, which has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Global Health, found that for the years 2009 through 2019, countries that received a sustained high level of USAID funding saw a mortality rate reduction of 0.8 death per 1,000 women of reproductive age. This translates to about one million to 1.3 million deaths prevented, or four extra years of life expectancy, says Gawande, who is a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital, as well as a writer and public health researcher.

Amanda Montañez; Sources: “Accounting for Aid: Estimating the Impact of United States' Global Health Investments on Mortality among Women of Reproductive Age Using Synthetic Control and Bayesian Methods,” by Karar Z. Ahsan et al. Preprint posted to SSRN on August 27, 2024 (USAID funding effects data); “Mortality Rates among U.S. Women of Reproductive Age, 1999–2019,” by Alison Gemmill et al., in American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Vol. 62, No. 4; April 2022 (U.S. estimate)

With the Trump administration gutting USAID, many of these longevity benefits could disappear. And while the administration has claimed the cuts are meant to prevent government waste, Americans largely support foreign aid.

“This has always been extremely bipartisan,” Weiss says of foreign health aid. “Congress and their constituents [have long been] behind these programs saving children's lives, especially in poor countries, with interventions that were fairly cheap,” he says. “This is what the American people wanted, across ideological lines.”

The U.S. Department of State, which is now overseeing USAID, did not respond to a request for comment.

Troy Jacobs is a pediatrician and served as a senior medical adviser for maternal and child health at USAID for more than 17 years. “As a pediatrician, the whole reason that I joined USAID was that the solutions to some of the most wicked global health problems in maternal and child health are not totally within the biomedical space,” he says. Before he was terminated at beginning of February, Jacobs was working in Ethiopia to provide lifesaving maternal and child health care. “In countries like Ethiopia, where there's a high burden-of-disease bill for infectious diseases, as well as growing chronic diseases like mental health issues and things like that, there was so much work to be done—but we were making progress,” dramatically reducing mortality among children under the age of five, he says. Now all that work has been put on hold.Jacobs's colleagues in Ethiopia are telling him the cuts have caused a lot of hardship and confusion, he says. “And in that confusion, services are being delayed. People are not able to access resources,” he adds. “Globally, we're estimating 95 million people [have been affected by] the loss of basic medical services.”

The USAID cuts have affected more than just funding for children's and women's health. They have terminated the President's Malaria Initiative, which was protecting 53 million people from disease and death through the use of bed nets, diagnostics and treatments, according to Gawande. They have ended all work on tuberculosis, including funding for most TB treatment. And they have halted USAID contracts that administer funding from the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the landmark HIV program launched by then president George W. Bush in 2003 and funded with bipartisan support by Congress ever since. PEPFAR has been providing medication to 20 million people worldwide.

Anna Katomski was hired as a program analyst in the HIV/AIDS office at USAID's global health bureau, but she was laid off in late January after just two weeks. She was supposed to work on a PEPFAR-funded project called Maximizing Options to Advance Informed Choice for HIV Prevention (MOSAIC), with the purpose of scaling up HIV prevention for adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa. The project was aimed at testing various approaches to HIV prevention, including a long-acting injectable form of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

“So much of this work is either stopped because of USAID putting out its funding or will be stopped very soon,” Katomski says. And these long-acting medications have to be tapered off—you can't just stop them cold turkey and switch to a pill, she notes. This could leave girls and young women vulnerable to HIV infection. “If, say, one of these adolescent girls or young women engage in in unprotected sex, for example, with a person with a penis who has HIV, they are at high risk of contracting the disease,” Katomski says. “HIV incidence is going to soar.”

On March 5 the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Trump administration could not freeze about $2 billion in foreign aid. A federal judge later specified a date by which the administration had to pay back payments to USAID contractors for work that was already completed, but the decision doesn't address future payments.

The Supreme Court's ruling is important, but “the damage has already been done,” Gawande says. “Many of these organizations have already terminated most of their staff. They're barely standing as organizations, but getting their payments that are past due would at least divert bankruptcy and make sure people's pensions can be funded and things like that.” The question is what the Court will do now, he says, “because [the Trump administration has] dismantled the agency, and the ruling needs to be enforced somehow.”

Expectant mothers in Busia County have received a significant boost in maternal healthcare following the donation of five ultrasound machines by Rainbow 4 Africa UK. The machines, valued at over Ksh 5 million, were distributed to Angurai, Port Victoria, Nangina, Matayos, and Sio-Port Sub-County Hospitals.

The donation aims to enhance early screening and detection of pregnancy complications, improving maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The machines will help monitor fetal development and enable expectant mothers to access essential services closer to home.

Speaking during the handover ceremony at Matayos Sub-County Hospital, Busia Deputy Governor and County Executive Committee Member (CECM) for Health, H.E. Arthur Odera, expressed gratitude for the support. He emphasized that the equipment would help reduce maternal and neonatal deaths caused by undetected pregnancy complications.

Dr. Frank Wanyama, leading the Rainbow 4 Africa UK Kenya delegation, reaffirmed the organization's commitment to strengthening healthcare in underserved areas. He highlighted the alarming rates of maternal and neonatal deaths in Busia and noted that this intervention aims to curb the crisis.

“The statistics of maternal and neonatal deaths due to undetected pregnancy complications are concerning. Rainbow 4 Africa UK is stepping in to help address this issue,” said Dr. Wanyama.

With this latest donation, Rainbow 4 Africa UK has now supplied a total of five ultrasound machines to hospitals in Busia County. Local healthcare workers welcomed the initiative, noting that expectant mothers previously had to travel long distances for ultrasound services.

To ensure the sustainability of the initiative, the County Health Department has committed to training healthcare personnel on the proper use and maintenance of the machines. This effort will enhance service delivery and contribute to improved maternal healthcare in the region.

A newly-discovered spiral galaxy, dubbed the Big Wheel, formed just 2 billion years after the big bang – far earlier, considering its size, than astronomers thought possible.

Themiya Nanayakkara, at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia, says the discovery was an accident. He and his colleagues were looking for quasars, energetic regions at the heart of some galaxies, with the James Webb Space Telescope in November 2022 when a “large spiral galaxy popped up”.

New NASA Missions, Bonus Moons for Saturn and Whale Urine That Balances Ocean Chemistry

The EPA rolls back regulations, NASA launches two exciting missions, and we discuss the surprising way whale urine moves nitrogen across the ocean.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's get this week started with our usual science news roundup.

First, unfortunately, I need to update you on some troubling environmental news.

Last Wednesday the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, announced that the agency plans to get rid of or weaken many environmental rules and policies. Zeldin said the EPA could even pivot away from officially recognizing that greenhouse gases are bad for us.

Back in 2007 the Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants covered by the Clean Air Act and that meant that the EPA needed to determine whether these emissions by new motor vehicles were tied to air pollution that could harm the public, or if the science was too uncertain. Well, the science was certain. In 2009 the EPA officially determined that greenhouse gases threaten public health. Zeldin announced that the administration plans to reconsider these findings. In a video Zeldin posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, about the plans, he referred to the determination as…

[CLIP: Lee Zedlin on X: “The holy grail of the climate-change religion.”]

Feltman: It's important to note that since 2009 the evidence that greenhouse gas emissions put human lives in danger has only grown.

According to Zeldin, the EPA plans to take a series of 31 actions to change or eliminate environmental regulations. Now, the big headline is that sectors like power generation and the automotive industry could face fewer regulatory requirements around climate pollution. The agency is also considering going after rules related to hydrofluorocarbons, which are extremely potent greenhouse gases. Zeldin argued that these gases contribute to food inflation by forcing companies to use refrigerant systems that make food more expensive. Other agency targets include regulations around wastewater from coal plants, industrial release of mercury and other toxins, soot pollution, and clean water protections for rivers and wetlands.

In an EPA news release, Zeldin said the following about the proposed changes: "Today is the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen. We are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion.”

E&E News by Politico reports that the EPA won't be able to do all of this at once. Overturning that 2009 finding on the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions will take at least a year. But there are plenty of environmental regulations the agency could roll back in the meantime. In recent days the EPA has canceled hundreds of grants and Zeldin has pledged to cut more than half of the agency's spending. Last Monday, Zeldin wrote in a statement that the EPA was “working hand-in-hand with DOGE,” which is overseen by Elon Musk. Last Thursday a federal judge ordered the U.S. DOGE Service to turn over records to 14 state attorneys general who allege that Musk's cost-cutting sweeps are violating the Constitution.

Meredith Hankins, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told E&E News that the breadth of the proposed EPA rollbacks was surprising. In summary, she said, “the vibes are bad.” We will definitely be keeping an eye on what the EPA is up to in the next few months.

But for now let's cleanse our palettes with some space news. Last Tuesday two NASA missions headed into space. One of those missions centers on a new space telescope called SPHEREx—no relation to SpaceX; it's short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer. Of course, NASA loves a good backronym. It's going to create a three-dimensional map of the sky every six months. The telescope will measure the distances between us and about 450 million other galaxies, in part to help understand how the universe rapidly expanded in the split second after the big bang.

Tagging along on the same flight was NASA's PUNCH, short for Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere. That mission, which comprises four suitcase-sized satellites, is going to study solar wind. And I bet NASA was pleased as punch to get two awesome missions up on the same ride. But I hope those satellites realized they were getting into like an Uber Pool situation.

In other great space news, Saturn is officially the mooniest planet in our solar system by a landslide. Last Tuesday the International Astronomical Union recognized the discovery of a whopping 128 new moons orbiting Saturn. That brings the planet's total up to 274, which is more moons than all the other planets in our solar system have combined—or at least the moons we know about, anyway. These findings, which relied on the use of the Canada France Hawaii Telescope to carefully watch Saturn's skies from 2019 to 2021, deepen the ringed planet's lunar dominance over Jupiter and its measly 95 moons. If you're wondering where all these moons could possibly fit, the answer is actually pretty simple: most of them are pretty much just wobbly little rocks. All 128 of the newly discovered moons are so-called irregular moons, meaning they're fragments of larger objects that got pulled into Saturn's orbit long ago. Each one is just a few kilometers across. The researchers say that many of these moons could stem from a relatively recent collision—just about a hundred million years ago.

We'll end things on a delightful note with a new study on the incredible power of whale urine. A paper published last Monday in Nature Communications reports on the “great whale conveyor belt,” which transports what researchers estimate is nearly 4,000 tons of nitrogen around the world each year. Nitrogen is crucial for supporting the ocean's food chain because it provides fuel for phytoplankton. Without whale pee, it turns out, some marine climates might really be hurting for the stuff.

Many whales spend the summer living in the nutrient-rich waters of cooler climates before traveling thousands of miles to warmer breeding grounds, where they live in higher concentrations. When they shed biomass in the form of poop, placentas and carcasses, they leave some of the nutrients of their summer binge in the waters of their winter homes. But according to this new study, it's the pee they leave behind that funnels the most nitrogen into their breeding grounds and they leave behind a lot of pee. One study found that a fin whale can produce 250 gallons of urine in a day..

The researchers estimate that whales might have transferred three times as many nutrients before commercial whaling lowered their populations. But even with that huge slowdown in the great whale conveyor belt, the animals are still super impactful: in one sanctuary in Hawaii, for example, whales provide approximately double the amount of nutrients that come from natural processes like ocean currents. Their liquid gold—and other bodily releases—helps support thriving ecosystems in coastal spots all over the world.

That's all for this week's science news roundup. We'll be back on Wednesday to show you that when it comes to colonoscopies, most people don't know—you get the idea.

Name: Mechanical Dog

What it is: A moving dog sculpture carved from ivory

Where it is from: Egypt

When it was made: Around 1390 to 1352 B.C.

What it tells us about the past:

Posed as if leaping through the air, this carved ivory dog opens its mouth as a lever is pushed up and down, revealing two lower teeth and a red tongue. The dog, which was discovered in an ancient Egyptian tomb, is a reminder that these domesticated canines have been beloved pets for at least 3,400 years.

The small dog sculpture, now at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, is made from elephant ivory. It is 7.2 inches (18.2 centimeters) long from nose to toes and shows the very good boy in a flying gallop, legs extended in the air. According to The Met, the lever that works the dog's lower jaw, making it appear to bark, was originally held on by a piece of leather cord looped through small holes. At some point, the cord was replaced with a metal dowel secured in the dog's shoulder.

The Met obtained the dog sculpture from the personal collection of Howard Carter, the Egyptologist who famously discovered King Tut's tomb in the Valley of the Kings in 1922. It is unclear exactly where the dog was found, but The Met suggests it may have been placed in an elite tomb sometime during the reign of Amenhotep III, King Tut's grandfather, in the 14th century B.C. But its purpose is unclear; it may have been a toy or a magical ceremonial object.

Ancient Egyptians were quite fond of their dogs. While some were used for hunting, shepherding or as watchdogs, many were pets. This sculpture definitely represents a domesticated dog because the incised lines around its neck form a collar, Met curator emerita Catharine Roehrig wrote in a publication of the artifact.

During Egypt's New Kingdom (1550 to 1070 B.C.), dog collars became increasingly ornate, often inscribed with the dog's name, such as those found in the Tomb of Maiherpri. This dog sculpture does not have a name attached to its collar, but The Met notes that some common Egyptian dog names translate to Blackie, Son of the Moon and Good-for-Nothing.

The breed of this sculpted dog is also unclear. Ancient Egyptians tended to prefer energetic dog breeds, and the ones often represented in their art include the ancestors of the hunting dog basenji, the Ibizan hound and the pharaoh hound.

Dogs were also linked with the god Anubis and with the afterlife in Egyptian mythology; they were sometimes seen as a kind of intermediary between the worlds of the living and the dead. Killing a dog — particularly a collared one — was a severe crime, and a family would have mourned the death of their dog as they would a human relative: by shaving their eyebrows. However, Egyptians believed that they would meet their dogs again in the afterlife, which is likely the reason they mummified them and buried them in special pet cemeteries.

Platform X, formerly known as Twitter, suffered multiple outages on March 10.

Thousands of X users in the US and UK reported being unable to access the app throughout the day.

It is reported that owner Elon Musk attributed the outages to a "massive cyberattack" and claimed that "IP addresses originating from the Ukraine area" were behind it.

With reported issues peaking at 40,000 on Downdetector, the extent of the outage is beyond doubt.

It is the most significant service outage the platform has suffered in years, with the effects of the outage lasting for several hours.

But what exactly caused the outage?

Here are the original theories, followed by the opinions of cybersecurity experts.

Claim: Ukraine-based hackers were behind the cyberattack on X

After X's interruption, question marks remain over its cause – and who could be behind it, writes yahoonews, the Telegraph reports.

Elon Musk continues to claim that behind him is "a large, coordinated group with IP addresses from the Ukraine area."

Reality: it is impossible to determine the true source of the attack on X

Analysts across the web are broadly united in their understanding that X suffered a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.

This is traditionally a fairly crude form of cyberattack.

It floods a target's servers, exceeding their capacity and preventing real users from accessing the website in question.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ciaran Martin – a professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government and former head of the UK's National Cyber ​​Security Centre – described the technique as "not that sophisticated".

Some experts suggest the opposite.

David Mound said in a statement that "DDoS attack tactics have evolved dramatically."

He noted that "attackers now distribute traffic across entire subnets."

It is reported that some experts have pointed out that DDoS attacks are usually orchestrated using a battalion of devices across the globe.

Traffic tends to be generated from IP addresses that are distributed across different regions, making it difficult to pinpoint where the attack originated.

Speaking to Wired, Shawn Edwards, chief security officer of Zayo, a network connectivity company, said that "attackers often use compromised devices, VPNs or proxy networks to obscure their true origins."

As a result, it is difficult to determine the true source of an attack.

However, even if it comes from a specific country, as Musk suggested, that doesn't mean the cyberattackers were based in that country.

Incidentally, Wired quoted an anonymous researcher who stated that none of the 20 main sources involved in the attack were located in Ukraine.

If correct, this would contradict Musk's statement regarding Ukrainian hackers.

Otherwise, there appears to be no evidence behind his claim that the IP addresses involved in the attack originated in Ukraine.

But, this does not mean that a state actor could not be involved.

Another question is how the attack was able to affect X significantly.

DDoS attacks are relatively common, with Musk himself announcing that X is “attacked every day.”

So why did this attack bring down X?

Musk is keen to suggest that a group with vast resources is behind him.

However, a number of independent analysts have identified that the platform's servers were not properly secured, leaving them publicly exposed to attack. /Telegraph/

March 17, 2025





Belgian offshore installation contractor Jan De Nul, in consortium with Greek cables supplier Hellenic Cables has signed a framework agreement with National Grid for strategic HVDC interconnections in the U.K.

This agreement will entitle the consortium to participate in upcoming tenders for call-off projects for the design, manufacturing, supply, installation, testing, and commissioning of HVDC cable systems as part of National Grid's large-scale offshore and onshore transmission infrastructure investment program.

The deal, which has an initial term of five years with an option for extension of up to three additional years, is a key component of National Grid's strategy to secure long-term partnerships that support deliverability for critical projects in the UK.

The U.K. Government's commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2050 has placed significant emphasis on expanding the country's electricity grid infrastructure to integrate renewable energy sources, such as offshore wind.

National Grid's cable framework aims to support this transition, ensuring a robust and reliable energy network, and this framework will play a crucial role in enhancing grid resilience, facilitating renewable energy integration and ensuring energy security for the future.

The consortium will participate in potential future tenders for turnkey projects.

“We are proud to partner with National Grid through this framework for strategic HVDC interconnections. The agreement confirms our position as World Builders of the energy transition through providing vital power cable links,” said Wouter Vermeersch, Director Subsea Cables Offshore Energy at Jan De Nul.

“This agreement strengthens our commitment to supporting the UK's energy transition and offshore wind ambitions. We are proud to be part of this critical framework, providing world-class HVDC cable solutions,” added Kostas Savvakis, General Manager, Hellenic Cables.

The Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited has introduced a youth empowerment initiative targeting the North-West region of Nigeria. The programme aims to equip participants with advanced technological skills and improve broadband access in remote areas.

The initiative, featuring a Space-Tech Hackathon and Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) training, is scheduled to take place in Dutse, Jigawa, from April 7 to 11.

In a statement issued in Abuja, Aisha Bantam, NIGCOMSAT's Head of Corporate Affairs, confirmed that the programme is designed to engage university students, start-ups, and local innovators from Kaduna, Kano, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Katsina, and Jigawa states.

Interested participants can register via the official link: https://bit.ly/VSAT_JIGAWA.

NIGCOMSAT previously organised a similar programme in the North-East, hosting a regional Space-Tech Hackathon in Yola, Adamawa State, from February 24 to 28. That event, co-hosted with the Adamawa State Government, focused on grassroots innovation in satellite technology, driving economic and social impact.

Providing further details, NIGCOMSAT's Managing Director, Jane Egerton-Idehen, highlighted that the five-day event would offer mentorship and hands-on experience in satellite technology.

“The hackathon provides participants with a platform to identify challenges, generate ideas, develop prototypes, and receive expert mentorship,” she explained.

She also announced that the winning team from the hackathon would be enrolled in the NIGCOMSAT Accelerator Programme Cohort 2025, where they will receive further support to develop and implement their projects.

Beyond the hackathon, Egerton-Idehen revealed that 100 youths will receive specialised training in VSAT installation, a crucial technology for expanding broadband access in underserved communities.

Egerton-Idehen reiterated that the overarching goal of the initiative is to inspire technological innovation, tackle community challenges, and reduce youth unemployment across Nigeria.

She also confirmed that the North-West Hackathon and VSAT training will be jointly hosted by Jigawa State and NIGCOMSAT Ltd.

The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are warning against a dangerous ransomware scheme.In an advisory posted earlier this week, government officials warned that a ransomware-as-a-service software called Medusa, which has launched ransomware attacks since 2021, has recently affected hundreds of people.

Medusa uses phishing campaigns as its main method for stealing victims' credentials, according to CISA. To protect against the ransomware, officials recommended patching operating systems, software and firmware, in addition to using multifactor authentication for all services such as email and VPNs.

Experts also recommended using long passwords, and warned against frequently recurring password changes because they can weaken security. Medusa developers and affiliates — called “Medusa actors” — use a double extortion model, where they “encrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid,” the advisory said.

Medusa operates a data-leak site that shows victims alongside countdowns to the release of information. “Ransom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets,” the advisory said.

“At this stage, Medusa concurrently advertises sale of the data to interested parties before the countdown timer ends. Victims can additionally pay $10,000 USD in cryptocurrency to add a day to the countdown timer.”

Since February, Medusa developers and affiliates have hit more than 300 victims across industries, including the medical, education, legal, insurance, technology and manufacturing sectors, CISA said.

IAM Healthcare Bargaining Committee Member Kelly Williams read a powerful message from her coworkers in the executive office of The Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center. Her statement listed the reasons safe staffing levels are critical to patient care at OSU hospitals and called for OSU executives to recruit and retain more front-line healthcare staff.

Williams' courage was reinforced by the fact that OSU Chief Operating Officer Jay Anderson's office was packed full of her coworkers. The petitions they delivered were from more than 1,200 front-line healthcare workers and Columbus community members supporting these IAM Healthcare members.                                                                       

“We routinely hear stories of patient care units that should be staffed with one Patient Care Associate for four, five, or six patients,” said Williams. “But instead they are expected to care for 10, 11, 12 or more patients at once.” 

The Medical Center has acknowledged a first-year turnover rate of more than 50% among the highly skilled Patient Care Associates (PCAs) and Psychiatric Care Technicians (PCTs). 

“It's clear when we're given the bare minimum of PCTs that staffing is done reactively and not proactively.” said Dylan England-Carroll, a Senior PCT who also read a statement on behalf of their coworkers. “Our patients are going through the toughest days of their lives. They deserve better from the hospital, but OSU executives are giving them the bare minimum number of support staff and stretching us thin.”

The day after the action, OSU Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) Deana Sievert attended negotiations to respond to IAM Healthcare members' critical staffing and ratio concerns. Bargaining committee members asked questions and delivered powerful testimonies on the daily challenges faced by patients, PCAs and PCTs. IAM Healthcare Bargaining Committee Members expressed appreciation for CNO Sievert's respectful engagement, but said it was clear that she and other executives lack a concrete plan to address the understaffing crisis. 

In response to the continued failures of OSU executives, PCA and PCT workplace leaders have called for an informational picketing action at the Medical Center on Tuesday, March 19, 2025. 

With the only remaining scheduled meeting date between the parties and a federal mediator approaching, the workplace leaders say they and their colleagues are prepared to take further action if OSU executives do not make movement on safe staffing, recruitment, and retention.

IAM Healthcare is a rapidly growing department within the powerhouse IAM Union, which has more than 600,000 current and retired members across the U.S. and Canada. International Union leaders backed their membership's readiness for further action.

“We will bring the full resources of our international union to bear in support of these courageous IAM Healthcare professionals and their struggle to protect their patients,” said IAM Union International President Brian Bryant. “The OSU executives still have time to do the right thing by investing in safe staffing, recruitment, and retention of front-line staff.”


                        Union Member Rights and Officer Responsibilities Under the LMRDA The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) guarantees certain rights to union members and imposes certain responsibilities on union officers.

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, enabling machines to understand and generate human-like text with remarkable accuracy. However, despite their impressive language capabilities, LLMs are inherently limited by the data they were trained on. Their knowledge is static and confined to the information they were trained on, which becomes problematic when dealing with dynamic and constantly evolving domains like healthcare.

The healthcare industry is a complex, ever-changing landscape with a vast and rapidly growing body of knowledge. Medical research, clinical practices, and treatment guidelines are constantly being updated, rendering even the most advanced LLMs quickly outdated. Additionally, patient data, including electronic health records (EHRs), diagnostic reports, and medical histories, are highly personalized and unique to each individual. Relying solely on an LLM's pre-trained knowledge is insufficient for providing accurate and personalized healthcare recommendations.

Furthermore, healthcare decisions often require integrating information from multiple sources, such as medical literature, clinical databases, and patient records. LLMs lack the ability to seamlessly access and synthesize data from these diverse and distributed sources. This limits their potential to provide comprehensive and well-informed insights for healthcare applications.

Overcoming these challenges is crucial for using the full potential of LLMs in the healthcare domain. Patients, healthcare providers, and researchers require intelligent agents that can provide up-to-date, personalized, and context-aware support, drawing from the latest medical knowledge and individual patient data.

Enter LLM function calling, a powerful capability that addresses these challenges by allowing LLMs to interact with external functions or APIs, enabling them to access and use additional data sources or computational capabilities beyond their pre-trained knowledge. By combining the language understanding and generation abilities of LLMs with external data sources and services, LLM function calling opens up a world of possibilities for intelligent healthcare agents.

In this blog post, we will explore how Mistral LLM on Amazon Bedrock can address these challenges and enable the development of intelligent healthcare agents with LLM function calling capabilities, while maintaining robust data security and privacy through Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.

Healthcare agents equipped with LLM function calling can serve as intelligent assistants for various stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and researchers. They can assist patients by answering medical questions, interpreting test results, and providing personalized health advice based on their medical history and current conditions. For healthcare providers, these agents can help with tasks such as summarizing patient records, suggesting potential diagnoses or treatment plans, and staying up to date with the latest medical research. Additionally, researchers can use LLM function calling to analyze vast amounts of scientific literature, identify patterns and insights, and accelerate discoveries in areas such as drug development or disease prevention.

LLM function calling offers several advantages for enterprise applications, including enhanced decision-making, improved efficiency, personalized experiences, and scalability. By combining the language understanding capabilities of LLMs with external data sources and computational resources, enterprises can make more informed and data-driven decisions, automate and streamline various tasks, provide tailored recommendations and experiences for individual users or customers, and handle large volumes of data and process multiple requests concurrently.

Potential use cases for LLM function calling in the healthcare domain include patient triage, medical question answering, and personalized treatment recommendations. LLM-powered agents can assist in triaging patients by analyzing their symptoms, medical history, and risk factors, and providing initial assessments or recommendations for seeking appropriate care. Patients and healthcare providers can receive accurate and up-to-date answers to medical questions by using LLMs' ability to understand natural language queries and access relevant medical knowledge from various data sources. Additionally, by integrating with electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical decision support systems, LLM function calling can provide personalized treatment recommendations tailored to individual patients' medical histories, conditions, and preferences.

Amazon Bedrock supports a variety of foundation models. In this post, we will be exploring how to perform function calling using Mistral from Amazon Bedrock. Mistral supports function calling, which allows agents to invoke external functions or APIs from within a conversation flow. This capability enables agents to retrieve data, perform calculations, or use external services to enhance their conversational abilities. Function calling in Mistral is achieved through the use of specific function call blocks that define the external function to be invoked and handle the response or output.

LLM function calling typically involves integrating an LLM model with an external API or function that provides access to additional data sources or computational capabilities. The LLM model acts as an interface, processing natural language inputs and generating responses based on its pre-trained knowledge and the information obtained from the external functions or APIs. The architecture typically consists of the LLM model, a function or API integration layer, and external data sources and services.

Healthcare agents can integrate LLM models and call external functions or APIs through a series of steps: natural language input processing, self-correction, chain of thought, function or API calling through an integration layer, data integration and processing, and persona adoption. The agent receives natural language input, processes it through the LLM model, calls relevant external functions or APIs if additional data or computations are required, combines the LLM model's output with the external data or results, and provides a comprehensive response to the user.

High Level Architecture- Healthcare assistant

The architecture for the Healthcare Agent is shown in the preceding figure and is as follows:

A sample code using function calling through the Mistral LLM can be found at mistral-on-aws.

Data privacy and security are of utmost importance in the healthcare sector because of the sensitive nature of personal health information (PHI) and the potential consequences of data breaches or unauthorized access. Compliance with regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR is crucial for healthcare organizations handling patient data.

The six guiding principles of using AI tools in healthcare. Credit: FUTURE-AI consortium

A new set of guidelines have been launched to create trustworthy AI systems in health care. The first of its kind, the FUTURE-AI guideline provides recommendations covering the entire lifecycle of medical AI, from design, development and validation to regulation, deployment, and monitoring.

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in health care, helping with tasks like disease diagnosis and predicting treatment outcomes. However, despite these advances, many health care professionals and patients are still hesitant to fully embrace AI technologies. This hesitation largely stems from concerns about trust, safety, and ethics.

In particular, existing research has shown that AI tools in health care can be prone to errors and patient harm, biases and increased health inequalities, lack of transparency and accountability, as well as data privacy and security breaches.

To overcome these challenges the FUTURE-AI Consortium has developed a comprehensive set of guidelines published in the BMJ. Developed by an international consortium of 117 experts from 50 countries the new guidelines called FUTURE-AI provide a roadmap for creating trustworthy and responsible AI tools for health care.

The FUTURE-AI guidelines are built around six guiding principles:

Gary Collins, Professor of Medical Statistics at the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, and author of FUTURE-AI said, "These guidelines fill an important gap in the field of health care AI to give clinicians, patients, and health authorities the confidence to adopt AI tools knowing they are technically sound, clinically safe, and ethically aligned. The FUTURE-AI framework is designed to evolve over time, adapting to new technologies, challenges, and stakeholder feedback. This dynamic approach ensures the guidelines remain relevant and useful as the field of health care AI continues to rapidly advance."

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) posted a Tiktok video on Feb. 20 saying he had "breaking news" about the fate of Medicare coverage for telehealth visits, which allow patients to see health care providers remotely from their homes.

"Breaking news: The Trump administration just announced that Medicare will stop covering telehealth starting April 1," Khanna said. "We need to stand up to these Medicare cuts."

The same day, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services posted a document online titled "Telehealth" that said, "Through March 31, 2025, you can get telehealth services at any location in the U.S., including your home. Starting April 1, 2025, you must be in an office or medical facility located in a rural area (in the U.S.) for most telehealth services."

CMS did not respond to requests for comment about the post. The White House also did not respond to requests for comment.

The telehealth benefit was first put in place as a temporary Trump-era addition to Medicare coverage during the covid-19 public health emergency.

Khanna's statement took on more significance leading up to the threat of a government shutdown, but late last week Congress averted one by approving a stopgap spending bill.

The expiration date for the benefit has been known since December, when Congress extended coverage around telehealth through March 31. The roughly 90-day reprieve was part of a compromise after then-President-elect Donald Trump and his ally Elon Musk criticized a sweeping, end-of-year legislative package that would have, among other things, continued those benefits for two years.

Their opposition forced Congress to pass a stripped-down version of the end-of-year bill. Telehealth's two-year extension, included in the initial bill, became collateral damage.

Last week, just as the clock was ticking down, House Republicans passed a spending bill for the rest of the fiscal year that includes another extension of telehealth flexibilities — this one lasting through September. The Senate then cleared the bill for Trump's signature, with the support of 10 Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Regardless, the two-year extension proposed in December — or a permanent extension, as Khanna has urged — looks unlikely.

"President Trump and Elon Musk blew up the continuing resolution last December that would have extended these telehealth authorities by two years," Khanna told us via email. "Trump should work with Congress to extend telehealth coverage for Medicare beneficiaries."

It wouldn't come free. Permanently extending telehealth for medical care under Medicare could cost taxpayers about $25 billion over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. The CBO calculated five months of expanded telehealth coverage as costing $663 million, and calculated that that would total almost $25 billion through fiscal year 2031 if spending remained level, which it may not do.

Also, the agency and the Government Accountability Office have raised concerns about fraud and overuse of the benefit, among other potential issues.

Congress made Medicare coverage of behavioral health services delivered remotelypermanent in December 2020, but left other telehealth benefits hanging on by a string. Instead, lawmakers extended them for short periods during the nearly two years since the public health emergency officially ended in May 2023.

"Now, once again, we've got another deadline where, if Congress doesn't act, our flexibilities go away," said Kyle Zebley, senior vice president of public policy for the American Telemedicine Association.

And if, at some point, the telehealth benefits aren't extended, is it fair to describe the policy change as a cut? Khanna, for instance, plans to introduce the Telehealth Coverage Act, which would require Medicare to cover seniors' telehealth services.

Politically speaking, it's a powerful question when trying to leverage public support — and politicians in both parties often accuse their opponents of "cutting" federal benefits when they make changes to programs.

"Khanna is overly dramatic," said Joseph Antos, a senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

If the provision expires, Antos said, "this is not a Trump cut."

But beneficiaries might have a different experience. Since the early days of the pandemic — five years now — millions of patients have come to rely on telehealth for their medical services. That benefit, even with another temporary reprieve, would still be at risk.

According to CMS, more than 1 in 10 Medicare beneficiaries used virtual care services as of 2023. And, after the Trump administration green-lighted telehealth for Medicare recipients in 2020, many private insurers did the same.

Overall telehealth claims in Medicare rose from fewer than 1% of all claims before the covid pandemic to a peak of 13% in April 2020. Now they stand at close to 5%, according to Fair Health, a nonprofit that tracks health care costs.

Those in the telehealth industry are optimistic about the current extension. The Trump administration, they say, has been sending encouraging signals — even highlighting its previous support of telemedicine in its fact sheet on the launch of the President's Make America Healthy Again Commission.

"We've been sweating bullets," Zebley said. "But it's been nerve-wracking before. I think we're going to get it done."

Antos said, however, that after the extension in the House-passed spending bill, Medicare's telemedicine benefits could be dead.

Khanna said, "Breaking news: The Trump administration just announced that Medicare will stop covering telehealth starting April 1. … We need to stand up to these Medicare cuts."

The statement is partially accurate, because the Trump administration announced the March 31 sunset of Medicare telehealth visits, and some beneficiaries who were using that benefit could see it as a "cut." But the claim lacks key context that the expiration date was set by Congress, not the Trump administration.

After Khanna's claim, Congress extended access to telehealth coverage through September.

Based on information that was available at the time, we rate Khanna's statement Half True.

NEW YORK, March 17, 2025

President Abdallah announces Trustee Debbane's largest gift in LAU's history for LAU Global.

NEW YORK, March 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of its commitment to support education and healthcare in Lebanon, the Lebanese American University (LAU) marked the beginning of a new century of service to the community in a Centennial Gala Dinner held on March 13, 2025, at the New York Public Library.



 



Proceeds from the fundraiser will go toward LAU's initiatives to foster industry in Lebanon, support financially challenged students and patients, and create an ever-giving legacy.

The university's continued efforts to help uplift the country are needed more than ever as Lebanon emerges from years of crises and embarks on rebuilding and renewal.

The event was attended by New York State Assemblymember Alex Bores, Lebanon's Ambassador to the United Nations Hadi Hachem, Permanent Representative of the State of Kuwait to the United Nations Ambassador Tareq Al-Bannai, Consul General of Lebanon in New York Majdi Ramadan, members of the Board of Trustees, LAU President Emeritus Joseph G. Jabbra, alumni, donors, and friends of LAU committed to upholding LAU's mission.

Welcoming the distinguished guests, the Chairman of the LAU Board of Trustees Philip Stoltzfus said: "The Lebanese American University is a trusted institution for a simple reason: we always try to do the right thing, decade after decade, in times of crisis, in times of blessings. For a full century, for 100 years. It is not always easy and it is nearly always expensive, but acting this way is not a choice, it resides in our mission, the formative values of our founders, our sacred covenant with Lebanon."

LAU President Chaouki T. Abdallah announced that LAU trustee Raymond Debbane and family were making the greatest gift in LAU's history to launch the university's global strategy and support its New York campus.

Expressing his gratitude to sponsors, donors and friends of LAU for their generosity and commitment to the university's mission, he said: "Please join me in holding the gate of hope open for more students in Lebanon and around the world and thank you for helping us usher in the second century of LAU."

Alumnus and CEO of Synopsys, Sassine Ghazi ('91) and three-time World Music Award winner and Arab pop icon Elissa were honored at the event; Ghazi for his lifetime achievements in innovation and excellence and Elissa for her advocacy of women's rights and brave fight against breast cancer.

Ghazi said: "When I went to LAU in '88 I never imagined I would be here at its 100 anniversary. I love our country, and I love our heritage and our people."

"Today, more than ever, our nation needs passionate leaders with access to education," said Elissa. "It is our collective duty to nurture this hope and empower future generations to believe in themselves and dream so they can best represent Lebanon anywhere like yourselves."

The evening was co-chaired by LAU trustees, H.H. Sheikha Intisar Al Sabah and Mr. Peter Tanous.

The Digital Medicine Society (DiMe) and Google Health launched a free online course for medical professionals, researchers, administrators and innovators to learn the fundamentals of generative AI, large language models (LLMs) and the technologies' use cases in healthcare.

The Generative AI for Healthcare course gives stakeholders an understanding of LLMs and their applications in healthcare. Participants will also gain insights into generative AI technology, develop prompt engineering skills and explore how AI can support decision-making in clinical settings.

The course, available to the DiMe community, combines videos, quizzes and hands-on labs. Participants must take a survey before gaining access to the course, and the self-paced course and lab are timed for one hour each. 

THE LARGER TREND

Exploring the use of AI within healthcare began in the 1960s and has expanded substantially within the sector, with the technology currently used within precision medicine, drug discovery and development, and robotic surgery.   

Although many researchers and experts have deemed the technology promising, it is crucial to address the ethical and societal considerations accompanying AI technology integration. 

Healthcare providers must consider proper use cases of the technology in the healthcare setting and have a complete understanding of the tech because, as Harjinder Sandhu, Microsoft's CTO of health platforms and solutions, told HIMSS TV, there are high-value and low-risk use cases and vice versa. 

"One of the things that AI systems can do is summarize patients in various contexts depending on who is asking the question and for what purpose," Sandhu said.

"The problem with that is that if the AI system hallucinates information, it makes up information about that patient or it omits important information that can lead to catastrophic consequences for that patient. That's an example of a really high-value but also high-risk use case," he added.

Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins joins 'Fox & Friends' to praise President Donald Trump's 'generational change' and questions whether the government has utilized resources 'wisely.'

Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Doug Collins clapped back at critics he accused of circulating "fake news" about the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts inordinately affecting veterans' care.

Collins, who remains an active colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserves, announced his agency is opening what will be a fourth new VA clinic in the few months he has been in office.

"As government union bosses, the legacy media and some in Congress have been spreading false rumors of health care and benefits cuts at VA, we've opened multiple brand-new clinics that will serve tens of thousands of veterans," Collins said in a statement.

"Don't believe the fake news."

VA SEC ACCUSES REPORTER OF SPREADING RUMORS ABOUT DOGE HURTING VETERANS

On Friday, the VA opened a new clinic in Hamilton, Montana, marking the fourth such ribbon-cutting since President Donald Trump took office just under two months ago.

Previously, Collins oversaw the establishment of a new clinic in fast-growing Spotsylvania, Virginia, – between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia, – as well as in Aurora, Colorado, and Ridgewood, Queens, in New York City.

A Montana VA official told Montana Public Radio last week that Collins had been clear that there would be "no cuts" to services despite DOGE attempting to take an ax to the bureaucracy – and with it many VA employees.

The 8,000-square-foot facility is 600% larger than a prior, now-defunct clinic in the area.

Meanwhile, the new Spotsylvania facility is primed to be the largest of its kind in the country, according to Fredericksburg-area media. 

FORT BRAGG IS BACK

An estimated 35,000 patients can be seen each year at the new site, located where Interstate 95 and US-1 diverge just south of the city.

While the VA is primed to cut 15% of its workforce via DOGE's efforts – from 471,000 to 398,000 – Collins reiterated to Fox News that there will be no interruption or decline in services or care quality.

Collins responded to a warning from Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who said that such cuts would hurt service to veterans and that the thought it is a "bad idea" should be a "bipartisan" admonition.

Citing the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the secretary said all parties should at least agree that the VA has seen its services at "high risk" for waste, fraud, abuse and insufficient care.

"I've been here four weeks, but it's interesting that there's no solutions being proposed," Collins told "Fox & Friends" last week.

"President Trump brought generational change to DC. And he's saying let's look at everything. So what we're looking at is, if our system is on a high risk list, if we've had issues and all that the government has decided to do lately has put money or people at something, then maybe we need to ask the better question -- are we using our resources wisely and making sure that our department is taking care of the veteran, which is our only responsibility?"

Other liberals have lambasted the administration over proposed cuts to VA staff, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., ranking member of the Senate Health Committee.

"They're going to gut the Department of Veterans Affairs, jeopardizing the health and well-being of millions of veterans," Sanders recently claimed.

One Democratic veteran in Congress, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, said he regularly visits the VA on a personal level and sees waiting lists and knows how troublesome the process can be.

"All of that is going to get worse," Moulton told MSNBC.

Collins said Trump set a goal for reduction-in-force, and that Democrats do not understand that the projected staff figures are part of a "deliberative process that's going to take some time."

"That's going to include career VA employees. It's going to include senior executives," he said.

Collins said the GAO has had the VA on its high-risk list for a decade, but only now are Democrats in Congress "yelling ‘don't do anything.'"

Of the layoffs thus far, Collins said the proportion has been less than 1% of the agency's workforce and has not really affected front-facing personnel.

He also said that $980 million in contract-related spending is being scrutinized in an attempt to instead reinvest it in patient care, as part of DOGE's work.

Additionally, on Monday, the VA announced it is phasing-out treatment for "gender dysphoria" – which had been supported by the Biden administration.

"Effective immediately, VA will not offer cross-sex hormone therapy to veterans who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria, unless" they are in the midst of receiving such care, the agency said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.

WM sees future healthcare trends, such as the growth of at-home healthcare, as a future business opportunity as it works to integrate Stericycle's medical waste assets.

Four months into WM's acquisition of Stericycle, the company has focused on ramping up facilities, completing divestitures and tracking key medical waste trends to market itself as a “comprehensive” option for medical waste collection, transportation and treatment.

WM is in the process of integrating Stericycle's medical waste and secure information destruction businesses into a segment now known as WM Healthcare Solutions. When WM announced the $7.2 billion deal last year, executives said the time was right to return to the medical waste sector due in part to the expanding population of aging people. 

The WM Healthcare Solutions business is expected to grow about 9% in 2025, which WM says will likely be driven by organic revenue growth and initiatives such as fleet and asset optimization.

WM had previously dabbled in the space on and off over the years, but hadn't become a major presence in the sector until recently, due in part to competition from companies like Stericycle, analysts said. In 2005, the company launched Waste Management Healthcare Solutions to provide regulated medical waste services for hospitals and other large waste generators, with the goal of becoming a major player in the industry. Yet by 2013 they had eased off those plans, noting medical waste represented less than $50 million of revenue. WM later sold most of its remaining medical waste assets.

Today, WM is following specific medical waste trends that will offer opportunities for new and expanded business, said Rafa Carrasco, president of WM Healthcare Solutions via email. “Sites of care for patients are significantly changing, with a growing trend towards receiving care in outpatient settings like ambulatory surgery centers, retail clinics, and even at home,” he said. 

Carrasco says the future demand for at-home care is a particularly notable trend, as it is expected to generate more waste, including waste from self-injectable medications meant to treat chronic illnesses. That in turn will lead to “more demand for proper medical and pharmaceutical waste disposal options.”

WM entered a highly competitive market when it broke back into the medical waste space, Carrasco said. One type of competitor is what Carrasco calls “large-quantity waste generators,” including some hospitals, which currently have their own onsite treatment processes such as autoclaves. Others in the medical waste space have made a name for themselves by specializing in either collection or transportation services.

Yet WM sees itself as being in an ideal position to offer treatment options alongside collection and transportation, which will help medical facilities simplify and streamline the waste management process, Carrasco said. WM Healthcare Services is positioned to do this because Stericycle already had an “extensive treatment and transportation infrastructure” as well as route density and overall knowledge of market dynamics, he said.  

WM Healthcare Services is currently working to integrate numerous aspects of Stericycle's operations, namely the new 110,000-square-foot medical waste incinerator project Stericycle completed in October in McCarran, Nevada. The $110 million, designed to accept material from hospitals and healthcare systems in the Western U.S., has gone through testing and is now ramping up operations, Carrasco said. Stericycle has 18 medical waste incinerator facilities around the world, according to WM's most recent securities filings.

The company expects to process 70% of volumes from Stericycle's Western customers by the end of March, and should be able to process all the remaining volumes from that region by the end of May, he said. The facility is expected to be fully operational by the end of December. 

In filings, WM underscored the importance of integrating Stericycle's assets and operations, which will take “a significant degree of difficulty and management attention” due to the size of the deal. 

Over the next three years, WM expects synergies from the deal to be about $250 million, with about $100 million of that in 2025. During a January earnings call, CEO Jim Fish also noted that WM would identify medical facilities that could benefit from cross-selling opportunities, starting as early as 2026.

WM is also in the process of identifying what to do with other elements of Stericycle's business and assets. Stericycle had 69 autoclaves and facilities described as “alternative medical waste treatment facilities, as well as 167 transfer stations as of December 31. WM listed 35 of Stericycle's locations as "held for sale,” according to filings. 

One recent deal, completed on January 2, was the divestiture of all Stericycle businesses in Spain and Portugal to Urbaser, an international environmental solutions company. Stericycle continues to operate in other markets in Western Europe, Carrasco said. 

WM is still operating Stericycle's services under the Stericycle name, but that will change in coming years. WM will eventually rebrand those services under the WM Healthcare Solutions umbrella, which “will take some time to complete,” he said.

The National Health Service of England will no longer be an independent organization supported by the British government. By slashing duplication, the Department of Health and Social Care said it will reduce unnecessary administrative spending and empower NHS staff to deliver better care for patients. 

"We now need to bring NHS England and DHSC together so we can deliver the biggest bang for our buck for patients, as we look to implement the three big shifts – analog to digital, sickness to prevention and hospital to community – and build an NHS fit for the future," said Sir James Mackey, NHS England Transition CEO, in a statement.

WHY IT MATTERS

Reversing a major top-down decision ushered in by former Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012, Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on March 13 that the move to slash the £200 billion of taxpayer money it takes to operate NHS England would free up NHS itself to focus more on patients.

"That money could and should be spent on nurses, doctors, operations, GP appointments," Starmer said in a video posted by Financial Times.

Earlier in the week, NHS England staff were warned of job cuts of up to 50%, and several senior officials resigned, according to the story. 

NHS England's incoming chair, Dr. Penny Dash, said in an agency statement that she will "work to bring together NHS England and DHSC to reduce duplication and streamline functions."

"When money is so tight, we cannot justify such a complex bureaucracy with two organizations doing the same jobs," Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said in the announcement about resorbing NHS England. "We need more doers and fewer checkers, which is why I'm devolving resources and responsibilities to the NHS frontline."

"We know that while unsettling for our staff, today's announcement will bring welcome clarity as we focus on tackling the significant challenges ahead and delivering on the government's priorities for patients," Mackey added.

Streeting noted that the creation of the NHS England bureaucracy "led to the longest waiting times, lowest patient satisfaction and most expensive NHS in history."

The number of people working for NHS more than doubled since 2010, when the NHS delivered its shortest waiting times and the highest patient satisfaction, the agency said.

DHSC also said that a centralized model could procure cutting-edge technology more rapidly at a lower cost and work more closely with the life sciences sector to advance treatments.

"If it's done well, with meaningful alignment between innovation, procurement and delivery, it could genuinely transform services and patient experience," Dr. Rachael Grimaldi, cofounder and CEO of CardMedic, said in a statement shared with several media outlets.

Dr. Rachael Fox, executive vice president of UK and EMEA for Altera Digital Health, said digital maturity and transformation have progressed across the NHS, including the interoperability of patient information.

"To support recovery and true reform, it's essential that momentum with innovation to drive better patient outcomes is maintained while we work through this transition," she said.

THE LARGER TREND

Mackey noted NHS England has played a vital role in improving the nation's health, including leading COVID-19 vaccinations and introducing "the latest, most innovative new treatments for patients."

In October, NHS England rolled out radiology artificial intelligence across 10 health trusts providing access to more than 75 regulatory-approved AI technologies from a single platform created by Deepc, an AI company.

NHS England said at the time that in rapidly deploying radiology AI, it could help reduce wait times for patients, increase the speed of diagnoses and help relieve pressure on NHS radiology departments.

ON THE RECORD

"Just because reform is difficult does not mean it should not be done," Streeting said in a statement. "This government will never duck the hard work of reform. We will take on vested interests and change the status quo."

                Doctors in New York will have to discuss treatment costs upfront with patients under a new law.

The routine is familiar for most people: When checking in for an appointment with a doctor or other health care provider, patients typically complete and sign a pile of paperwork, including a form that contains some version of the statement, "I agree to pay for all charges not covered by my insurance company."

Patients may not feel comfortable making that financial promise, often before they have any idea what the charges will be. But they generally sign the form anyway, because the alternative is often not to get the services they're seeking.

As a result, consumers may be responsible for unexpected bills and at risk for medical debt.

In New York, state officials, advocates and the health care provider community have been engaged in a policy tug-of-war over efforts to protect consumers. Patient advocates don't want them to get stuck signing blank-check forms that put them in financial jeopardy. Doctors, hospitals and other providers don't want to disrupt their practices' workflow and payment logistics with cost discussions and paperwork, especially after services have been provided. 

State officials' efforts to find a satisfying compromise have so far fallen short.

At the center is a state law that took effect last fall to prohibit requiring patients to sign such consent-to-pay forms before they've received treatment and discussed the costs.

Legal analysts described it as the first such law in the country. Physician groups cried foul, saying it would raise payment issues and other significant logistical problems.

Those concerns found traction. Shortly before the law's start date, the state's health department delayed its implementation indefinitely. In addition, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul's proposed fiscal year 2026 budget would let providers go back to requiring patients to agree to pay for care in advance of receiving treatment. It also clarified that the consent requirements would not apply to emergency care.

A key provision of the new law would remain in place, however: Doctors and other providers would still be obligated to have the cost discussion with patients before the patient is asked to sign the form agreeing to pay for the service. 

Some consider even the remaining provision a significant step.

"Providers having an affirmative obligation to discuss treatment costs is unique," said Gregory Mitchell, a partner in the health and life sciences practice group at McDermott Will & Emery law firm who specializes in managed care. Clients from around the country have been reaching out to the law firm with questions.

Requiring providers to discuss costs with patients, whether before or after services are provided, would pose a "significant burden," he said. Doctors and other providers typically don't know specifics about patient deductibles, cost sharing or other insurance coverage details until after a claim is submitted to a health plan.

Health care services are different than refrigerators or other goods that people buy, doctors say. If a patient gets a colonoscopy and doesn't want to pay for it, "it's not possible to take the service back," said Jerome Cohen, a gastroenterologist and the president of the Medical Society of the State of New York, which represents physicians. 

As for the proposed changes in the 2026 budget, Cohen said the medical society "very much appreciates the governor's efforts to try to fix this problematic financial consent requirement."

But patient advocates are pushing back. The current practice is "unfair and it's wrong," said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Service Society of New York, a nonprofit that has successfully pushed for passage of several medical debt-related laws in recent years. No patient should ever have to preemptively agree to pay whatever a provider charges, Benjamin said.

In a written response to questions, Danielle De Souza, a spokesperson for the New York Department of Health, said that the proposed law change is justified, "given the burden of this requirement on both patients and providers." De Souza didn't respond to a request for clarification about what those patient burdens are.

Helen Krim walked out of a doctor's office in the Bronx borough of New York City a few years ago rather than sign an open-ended form agreeing to pay for any services recommended by the doctor.

It was the first time that Krim, who is covered by Medicare, had visited that primary care practice. When she told them she didn't want to sign the form, she was told they wouldn't serve her unless she did.

"I'm one of those annoying people who actually reads the forms," the retired bank project manager said. "It's kind of like signing a consent to be scammed." She found another practice that didn't ask her to sign a similar form.

There are other consumer medical debt protections at the federal and state level. The federal No Surprises Act restricts providers from billing consumers for out-of-network services in certain instances. It also requires providers to give good-faith cost estimates for self-pay patients. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a final rule in January that would have removed medical debt from people's credit reports, but the rule's implementation has been frozen by the Trump administration.

Several states besides New York have also taken steps to protect consumers with medical debt.

Benjamin said that simply requiring an unspecified "discussion" about costs doesn't address patients' potential unlimited financial liability. Under a bill that Benjamin's organization has drafted, providers would have to give patients a written good-faith estimate of their expected costs before the patient receives services and patients could not be held liable for unlimited or unspecified costs beyond that estimate.

"Let's be the first state to really have fair rules of engagement for both the providers and the patients about what is it that you're agreeing to be financially liable for at the point, beforehand," Benjamin said.

So far, though, the measure has not been introduced, with the focus in Albany on the governor's budget proposal.

Providers, too, are taking a wait-and-see attitude, Mitchell said, because the budget plan must still move through the legislative process.

Another New York medical debt-related law that took effect in October takes aim at the use of credit cards to pay for medical services. The Hochul administration has not proposed changing it. The law prohibits providers from requiring pre-authorization of credit cards or keeping a patient's card on file. It also requires providers to notify patients of the risks of paying for medical care with credit cards, which may lack medical debt protections. In addition, providers aren't allowed to help patients complete credit card applications under the law.

The laws are aimed at stopping unfair billing practices and reducing medical debt for New Yorkers. Earlier laws ban credit reporting of all medical debt, prohibit hospitals from suing patients with incomes under 400% of the poverty level, among other things.

New York providers don't like the credit card law either, though it hasn't generated the pushback seen with the consent-to-pay law.

In a statement, Brian Conway, a spokesperson for the Greater New York Hospital Association, said: "It's important to clarify that hospitals do not oppose the goals of the hospital financial assistance law reforms overall, but rather the operational burdens and patient disclosure overload that a few specific provisions create."

Tampa General Hospital (TGH) and Boston-based Mass General Brigham (MGB) are collaborating on a radiation oncology center, offering a new option for cancer care to Floridians in and around Palm Beach County.

The center is expected to offer more modern medical technology in addition to improved access and a "coordinated patient experience."

Construction costs for the new facility were not disclosed.

"This new center represents a significant evolution in the partnership between TGH and MGB, as we continue to execute our overall strategy to transform healthcare through innovation and collaboration with the nation's leading providers and physician-scientists," said John Couris, president and CEO of Tampa General.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

Under the partnership, TGH and MGB will open a 10,000-square-foot, co-branded and jointly owned radiation oncology center at Legacy Place in Palm Beach Gardens.

TGH will manage day-to-day operations, while MGB Radiation Oncology will provide expert quality and safety oversight.

In adhering to the tenets of academic medicine, the collaboration will create an integrated team of experts to address a spectrum of patient needs, from physicians and dosimetrists to patient advocates and administrators.

All members of the team will cross-collaborate, share and support each other to deliver responsive and customized care, the hospitals said.

The new center will be open for patient care in 2026.

THE LARGER TREND

According to the Florida Department of Health, for more than a decade, cancer has been the second leading cause of death in Florida, after heart disease. And the state has the second-highest cancer burden in the nation, with an average of 115,000 new cancers diagnosed and reported each year.

ON THE RECORD

"As we look to provide the most innovative, patient-centric cancer care possible across Florida, this new center and elevated collaboration with MGB is critical to achieving this goal" said Dr. Abe Schwarzberg, executive vice president and chief of Oncology at Tampa General and president of Tampa General Provider Network. "We've already seen how our collaboration can benefit the patients we serve, and by working alongside MGB to provide our patients with access to the expertise, experience and research findings from two of the top academic health systems, we have the potential to make a significant impact on their treatment outcomes."

Settle brings four decades of experience in law, healthcare, government, and public policy

PHILADELPHIA, March 17, 2025 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Royer Cooper Cohen Braunfeld LLC (RCCB), a law firm known for its distinctive blend of business acumen, legal expertise, and entrepreneurial spirit, is proud to welcome Eric L. Settle, a highly regarded healthcare attorney with long experience in healthcare insurance, law, government and public policy. Mr. Settle joins RCCB as Senior Counsel to expand and enhance its healthcare transactional and regulatory practice within the Corporate & Business Group, further strengthening the firm's ability to navigate the evolving healthcare landscape. His deep industry knowledge and strong relationships will be instrumental in growing RCCB's presence in the healthcare sector.



With four decades of experience, Mr. Settle has held senior and chief counsel roles at leading health insurance companies, including Aetna, UnitedHealthcare, and AmeriHealth Caritas, a key subsidiary of Independence Blue Cross. He also served as Deputy General Counsel to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, overseeing health and environmental affairs, and was more recently appointed by Governor Josh Shapiro as part of the administration's Transition Advisory Committee for Health and Human Services, Healthcare Sub-Committee.

Beyond his legal career, Mr. Settle has been deeply involved in healthcare policy and advocacy, serving as a hospital trustee, leading the successful effort for the passage of Pennsylvania Act 62—which mandated insurance coverage for children with autism—and supporting disadvantaged children through his long-standing role with the Early Head Start Program at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Mr. Settle also spent five years as a wealth management executive at Alliance Bernstein. Most recently, he was recruited by the Forward Party, a new national centrist party led by Andrew Yang and Governor Christine Todd Whitman to run for Attorney General of Pennsylvania. His campaign was well received, and he earned over 18,000 votes in all 67 counties contributing to the advancement of the party's efforts.

"Eric's work and connections in the healthcare industry, law, government and public policy make him a tremendous asset to our firm and our clients," said Neil Cooper, Executive Partner of RCCB. "Healthcare is a complex and rapidly evolving industry, and Eric's skills and experience will allow us to further service clients across the full spectrum of transactional and regulatory matters."

Mr. Settle's work in healthcare law includes transactions, dispute resolution, regulatory compliance, value-based care models, and payer-provider partnerships. He played key roles in major healthcare mergers, including Aetna's acquisition of NY Life and Prudential Health's businesses, and played a lead role in structuring an innovative commercial health plan joint venture with Jefferson Health System on behalf of United Healthcare. His work in public affairs and consulting has positioned him as a trusted advisor to companies, investors, providers, payors, innovators, and government agencies navigating the evolving healthcare landscape.

Joining RCCB marks a return to private practice for Mr. Settle after three decades in government, corporate and public affairs roles. Encouraged by longtime friend and RCCB Executive Partner Mr. Cooper, he was drawn to the firm's dynamic growth, entrepreneurial culture, and commitment to providing innovative legal solutions.

"I've watched RCCB grow over the past decade and have been consistently impressed by the caliber of lawyers joining the firm. Many of them, like me, saw an opportunity to practice law in a better way," said Mr. Settle. "After spending years advising businesses and policymakers, I realized I wanted to get back to practicing law and building something new. RCCB provides the perfect platform to launch a healthcare-focused practice that integrates regulatory expertise with corporate strategy."

With Mr. Settle's addition, RCCB strengthens its ability to guide healthcare clients through transactions, regulatory compliance, and strategic partnerships. His hands-on roles with healthcare mergers, investments, and payer-provider collaborations provides RCCB clients with a distinct advantage.

"There are significant opportunities in healthcare today—whether through mergers, private equity investments, or innovative payer-provider collaborations," Mr. Settle noted. "Having spent my career inside large healthcare organizations, I understand how these deals come together and how to navigate the regulatory complexities that come with them."

Beyond his professional achievements, Mr. Settle remains deeply involved in philanthropy and community service. He served as President of Main Line Reform Temple and continues his service as a trustee and investment committee chair, leading the effort to create a permanent endowment, as well as a governing board member of the Early Head Start Program at CHOP. He has also served as a Trustee at Colgate University and Bryn Mawr Rehab Hospital and Foundation and held leadership roles with the Philadelphia Bar Association and the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia. He resides in Bryn Mawr, PA, with his wife.

Most people with unsuppressed HIV in a large population study in Uganda were already diagnosed but not in clinical care, suggesting that re-engaging people with HIV and ensuring that they are receiving antiretroviral treatment could have a substantial impact on HIV transmission.

The findings were presented last week at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI 2025) in San Francisco.

A second study presented at the conference showed that men with HIV disengaged from care in Malawi were more likely to return to care if they received a supportive low-cost counselling intervention tailored to address the challenges that men face in taking antiretroviral treatment and remaining in care. A third study, carried out in Zambia, found that an intervention to encourage welcoming and supportive behaviours among care providers significantly improved return to care and retention in care among people who had interrupted treatment.  

The Ugandan study, carried out by the Rakai Health Sciences research group, investigated what proportion of the population in this rural district had detectable HIV viremia, and how many of these people were already diagnosed but disengaged from care.

When viral load is detectable, this indicates that HIV is replicating in the body. If the person is taking HIV treatment but their viral load is detectable, the treatment is not working properly. There may still be a risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners.

A patient's regular and ongoing engagement with medical care at a health care facility. 

A group of participants in a trial who receive standard treatment, or no treatment at all, rather than the experimental treatment which is being tested. Also known as a control arm.



The presence of virus in the blood.



A healthcare professional's recommendation that a person sees another medical specialist or service.

The study recruited people aged 15-49 in 34 communities and carried out HIV testing. Everyone who tested positive for HIV received a qualitative viral load test which can detect viral load above 1000 copies/ml. Viral load above this level is associated with a risk of HIV transmission. Participants were asked about their HIV status and any past or current antiretroviral use.

People newly diagnosed with HIV during the study were referred to a clinic for HIV treatment and followed up three months later to confirm that they had started treatment.

Anyone previously diagnosed with HIV was referred to a clinic for treatment. Those who had never started treatment were followed up three months later to confirm that they had started treatment.

The study tested 17,841 people; 3170 tested positive for HIV, 3134 underwent viral load testing and 316 (10%) had viral load above 1000 copies/ml. Just over half of those with detectable viral load (54%) said they were newly diagnosed with HIV, 10% said they had not started treatment, 33% said they were in care and 2.5% were previously in care.

However, after looking for clinical records and carrying out testing for antiretroviral drugs, a different picture emerged. In fact, one in five people who said they were newly diagnosed turned out to be already diagnosed but had not started treatment or had dropped out of care. Altogether, 83% of people with viremia were not in clinical care and three-quarters of this group had never started treatment.



Men, and people over 30 years of age, were more likely to have been misclassified.

A blood test to detect antiretroviral drugs showed that only 4% of those with viremia had any detectable antiretroviral drugs in their bloodstream, all of whom were currently in care.

Half of those who had started treatment dropped out within a year. At the time of the study, the median time since the last clinic visit was 2.8 years.

A randomised trial carried out in Malawi showed that men with HIV who received person-centred counselling delivered by lay people were just as likely to return to care and stay in care as men who received more complex and costly interventions.

The study, carried out through the Partners in Hope NGO in Malawi, recruited 569 men living with HIV who had been traced from chart reviews at 13 health facilities. Men were eligible for inclusion in the study if they had been diagnosed with HIV but had not initiated antiretroviral treatment or had interrupted treatment.

Participants were randomised to one of three study arms:

The primary outcome of the study was the proportion of participants in each arm who had initiated ART within three months of enrolment and had been out of care for less than 28 days by six months after treatment initiation.

Study participants had a mean age of 39 years and 91% had previously started treatment. Participants had been on treatment for a median of 12 months and out of care for a median of two months at the time of enrolment.



At nine months after enrolment, there was no significant difference in ART engagement between study arms (76% in the counselling arm vs 72% in the home-based ART arm and 85% in the stepped intervention arm).

In-depth interviews with 92 participants found that the elements of interventions most valued by the participants was counselling and positive interactions with healthcare workers. Kind and interactive counselling that offered tailored solutions and compelling messages was more important than dispensing ART at home, the interviews showed.

Treatment interruptions can be attributable to poor experiences of health care and fears about returning to care after missed appointments. Researchers at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia and universities in the United States designed an intervention to promote friendlier, more person-centred attitudes in healthcare staff, using training and coaching, measurement and feedback, and facility-level incentives such as recognition for staff.

To evaluate the effect of the intervention on client return to care after treatment interruption and sustained engagement in care, the researchers conducted a randomised trial involving 24 health facilities between August 2019 and November 2021. During the study period, 128,901 people with HIV were more than 30 days late and were judged to have interrupted treatment. Sixty-four per cent of those who interrupted treatment were female, most (66%) were aged 25-44 and one-third had been on treatment for at least five years.



During the one-year follow-up period, 65% of the control group and 71% of the intervention group returned to care, a risk difference of 5.7%. Among those who returned to care, people in the intervention group were less likely to experience another treatment interruption during the follow-up period (55% vs 44%, risk difference 10.4%). After one year, a total of 73% in the control group and 82% in the intervention group were still in care after returning to care. Overall, 49% of the control group and 58% of the intervention group were in care one year after the study began.

Researchers from the Viking Genes research project identified 108 genetic variants – differences in a person's DNA – in 23 genes, which can be linked to conditions like cancer and heart disease. These results were then communicated to participants, giving them the opportunity to undertake personalised treatment for their condition. Experts say it is one of the UK's first extensive efforts in returning clinically actionable genetic results to people involved in the study.

After receiving a letter advising him of a variant in the BRCA2 gene, one volunteer underwent tests that showed he had prostate cancer. He underwent a successful operation in February to remove his prostate and is already back at work on his fishing boat. The research also revealed that 10 of these disease-causing variants were much more common in either Orkney or Shetland than elsewhere in the UK. Experts say the findings demonstrate the power of targeted genetic screening to help improve the health of people from isolated communities. 

Viking Genes, led by experts at the University of Edinburgh, is investigating the genetics and health of volunteers with at least two grandparents from the Hebrides, Shetland or Orkney. In this latest study, researchers analysed the genetic data of 4,198 participants and found small differences known to affect health in about 2.5% of them. 

NHS Grampian clinical genetics services verified the findings before 64 consenting participants were notified about their results, with experts adhering to recently introduced international guidelines developed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for returning genomic results. The study, which involved researchers the University of Aberdeen and the Regeneron Genetics Center, is published in the American Journal of Human Genetics and was funded by the Medical Research Council. The letters were funded by a Wellcome Trust Institutional Translational Partnership Award (iTPA), through the iTPA team at Edinburgh Innovations.    

"These ground-breaking new results from the Viking Genes project underscore the critical role of genetic research in foreseeing and forestalling disease," said Professor Jim Flett Wilson, Chair of Human Genetics at the University of Edinburgh. "By tailoring our approach to fit specific genetic backgrounds, we can offer more precise, predictive, and preventative healthcare, thereby protecting communities, preserving health and saving lives. The results of this study provide a foundation for creating bespoke genetic screening programs for the Scottish Islanders and other unique genetic populations." 

Since 2005, Viking Genes has recruited over 10,000 volunteers from the Northern and Western Isles of Scotland — regions known for their unique gene pools due to historical isolation and limited migration. This distinct genetic background provides a powerful tool to identify rare but medically significant genetic variants, experts say. It has previously identified clusters of rare breast and ovarian cancers in Shetland and Orkney involving the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.

This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

As the fifth anniversary of Covid-19 lockdowns approaches, bipartisan lawmakers and medical professionals across the country are rallying behind a bill that would address a growing crisis in the healthcare field.

Dr. Lorna Breen was chief of the ER department at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. Known by colleagues as a tireless worker who cared about patients and protocol, Breen committed suicide while on a short break in Virginia in the midst of the pandemic to get a break from the high-pressure world of emergency medical care.

A New York Times story quoted Breen's father as calling her death a "casualty" of the pandemic and said she had no history of mental illness, but had seemed "detached" as of late.

Proponents of the Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Reauthorization Act told Fox News Digital that the mental strain, burnout, and stress of working in a high-pressure, life-saving field demand stronger support systems.

A recent study from a North Carolina healthcare group showed that more than half of doctor-respondents said they wouldn't go into the primary care field if they could "do it all over again."

According to its proponents, the Lorna Breen Act provides billions of dollars in resources to help prevent suicide, burnout, and mental and behavioral health conditions among healthcare professionals.

Two longtime ER physicians who are leading the charge on the nongovernmental side of things spoke with Fox News Digital this week.

Dr. Randy Pilgrim – chief medical officer for SCP Health – and Dr. Bentley Tate, the emergency room company's chief wellness officer – both have decades of experience working in the high-pressure field and said that now, as the U.S. looks back at the COVID-19 pandemic, is the time to bring this issue to the fore.

SCP Health works across 35 states and is a leading voice on mental healthcare for physicians, they jointly said.

Doctor wellness must be a major priority, and is often overlooked, Pilgrim said, noting that patients come to doctors to better their own health, and that it is, rightly for the patient, a one-way street in that regard.

"Patients can't be faulted for the fact that when they come to their clinician, their physician or other clinician, they really are thinking mostly about their own health and how they can improve that," he said.

Americans Split On Covid 5 Years After The Pandemic

"For many, many centuries there has been this phrase ‘Physician, heal thyself', which is variably interpreted. But in the context of this, it means the healthier the doctor is, the more available they are for the patients themselves."

"So, as mental health issues became more and more prevalent, more and more transparent, and more and more acknowledged that the stresses of the healthcare workforce are significant. It became very clear that destigmatizing that as well as providing resources to help, that was a very real phenomenon," Pilgrim added.

"Patients don't come to us saying, ‘Doctor, are you OK?' But at the end of the day, they want to know that we are [well] and it's our responsibility to be that way."

Mental health strains on physicians were largely an "underground phenomenon" until COVID-19 put physicians' well-being into the forefront of the news.

During the pandemic, gurneys were rolled out in front of overburdened urban hospitals, and physicians, both rural and otherwise, were working long shifts, resulting in burnout and strain.

"Physician suicide is the far end and very unfortunate far end of that spectrum," Tate said.

Lingering Lung Disorders 5 Years After Covid

"But there are so many people who are frustrated, who are weary. And the reality is, we all lose when a physician retires ten years before they thought they were – or 10 years into their career, with so many years of training [goes and] transitions into where they're not seeing patients directly, but some other aspect of health care because they just got so frustrated or worn down or frankly, in a bad mental state."

When doctors step away from patients for such personal reasons, the entire healthcare system loses, Tate said. When physicians are well and in the right frame of mind, patients benefit.

Pilgrim, who has also worked directly to push for Lorna Breen Act legislation, added that there is bipartisan acknowledgment that U.S. doctors need Congress' full support.

"At the end of the day, people realize this is about helping clinicians, but mainly so that they can help patients – But this is a patient-centered act. So, that's really easy to unify around," he said.

With the advent of DOGE scrutinizing every dollar the feds spend, there is also a new focus on how to pay for things like this act, Pilgrim added.

"People are looking for relatively small amounts of dollars that will have a relatively large and outsized impact," he said.

"And this actually is another thing that unifies congressmen and women is that this is a relatively small money in the grand scheme of things. And if you can impact just a single physician and make them him or her better, the hundreds to thousands of patients that benefit from that becomes an exponential impact."

Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va. and Roger Marshall, R-Kan. – a doctor himself – are leading the Senate version of the bill, but did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who is joined by Reps. Jennifer Kiggans, R-Va., and Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., on the House version said Thursday that the act is truly bipartisan and that she will work hard to pass it so that "doctors, nurses, physicians, and all healthcare providers can take care of themselves as they care for their patients."

"Healthcare professionals dedicate their lives to serving their patients, often at the expense of their own physical and emotional well-being, and ensuring they have the resources to stay healthy is one of my top priorities," Dingell said.

National Institutes of Health officials have urged scientists to remove all references to mRNA vaccine technology from their grant applications, two researchers said, in a move that signaled the agency might abandon a promising field of medical research.

The mRNA technology is under study at the NIH for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, including flu and AIDS, and also cancer. It was deployed in the development of covid-19 vaccines credited with saving 3 million lives in the U.S. alone — an accomplishment President Donald Trump bragged about in his first term.

A scientist at a biomedical research center in Philadelphia wrote to a colleague, in an email reviewed by KFF Health News, that a project officer at NIH had "flagged our pending grant as having an mRNA vaccine component."

"It's still unclear whether mRNA vaccine grants will be canceled," the scientist added.

NIH officials also told a senior NIH-funded vaccine scientist in New York state, who does not conduct mRNA vaccine research but described its efficacy in previous grant applications, that all references to mRNA vaccines should be scrubbed from future applications.

Scientists relayed their experiences on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional retaliation by the Trump administration.

A senior official at the National Cancer Institute confirmed that NIH acting Director Matthew Memoli sent an email across the NIH instructing that any grants, contracts, or collaborations involving mRNA vaccines be reported up the chain to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s office and the White House.

Memoli sent a similar message ahead of the agency canceling other research, such as studies of vaccine hesitancy.

Memoli's email on that topic bluntly stated that NIH was not interested in learning why people shun vaccines or in exploring ways to "improve vaccine interest and commitment."

The National Cancer Institute official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said that "it is reasonable to assume mRNA vaccine work is next."

The official said a similar memo also went out regarding NIH-funded work in South Africa, which the White House has targeted over false claims that the country's government is persecuting white people. More recently, another one went out regarding all global research collaborations, the official said.

Spokespeople for the White House, HHS, and the NIH did not respond to requests for comment.

The NIH, whose latest annual budget was $47 billion, is one of the world's most critical sources of funding for basic biomedical research. Its mission and programs are under unprecedented scrutiny from Trump's White House and the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-led agency created by a Trump executive order that has directed federal agencies to prepare for widespread layoffs.

The NIH is funding at least 130 studies involving the mRNA technology in covid vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna that have been administered to billions of people worldwide.

A former government official familiar with internal discussions said that the Trump administration intends to cut some grants for mRNA vaccine research but that the timing is unclear. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships with the administration.

Political conservatives in the U.S. have promulgated conspiracy theories, unsupported by scientific evidence, that the shots and their relatively new technology are dangerous. This has undermined public support for covid vaccinations and mRNA research.

"There will not be any research funded by NIH on mRNA vaccines," the scientist in New York said in an interview. "MAGA people are convinced that these vaccines have killed and maimed tens of thousands of people. It's not true, but they believe that."

Meanwhile, hundreds of other vaccine-related studies are in limbo. Kawsar Talaat, a vaccine researcher at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, has been waiting since the fall for money needed to recruit subjects for a study of an antidiarrheal vaccine.

"NIH approved our funding," she said, "and now we're waiting, and we don't know if it's going forward or going to be killed."

The scientist in Philadelphia signaled that he believes Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, is responsible for the NIH's turn against mRNA research.

"Kennedy's war on vaccines has started," the scientist told his colleague.

The scientist in New York said that it was "ridiculous" to remove mRNA language from the grant applications. But "if my grant is rejected for any reason," the scientist said, "people in my lab will lose their jobs."

"I've worked with some of them for 20 years," the scientist added. "They have children and families. There is a real climate of fear in academia about this now, especially among vaccine scientists."

"My grant does not involve a request for funds to conduct mRNA vaccine experiments," the scientist said, "so my principal concern was to avoid word-search flags that, at minimum, would lead to delays in any funding."

While tenured research professors at universities generally receive a salary from their institution, the staffers who work in their labs and offices are often paid through NIH grants. The 2023 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was given to two scientists for developing mRNA vaccines, through work that relied on pharmaceutical companies and on NIH scientists working under infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci.

According to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the chamber's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Kennedy promised during his Senate confirmation process that he would protect "the public health benefit of vaccination" and "work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems."

Cassidy, a physician, had expressed reservations about confirming Kennedy to the HHS post and challenged his anti-vaccine views during a confirmation hearing. He ended up voting for him, he said, because Kennedy had agreed to work closely with Cassidy and his committee.

However, Kennedy has faced scrutiny in his first weeks in office for his handling of a large measles outbreak among mostly unvaccinated people in Texas that has led to the death of a child, the first U.S. measles death in more than a decade. A patient who tested positive for measles died in New Mexico, but the cause hasn't been confirmed. Instead of urging vaccination against the disease, an almost surefire way to prevent infection, Kennedy has blamed malnourishment for the outbreak, promoted unproven treatments for measles, and falsely claimed in one Fox News interview that the vaccine is ineffective and even dangerous.

Cassidy did not respond to a request for comment on the NIH's potential abandonment of mRNA vaccine research.

As part of the Trump administration's push to examine spending on mRNA vaccines, health officials are reviewing a $590 million contract for bird flu shots that the Biden administration awarded to Moderna, Bloomberg News has reported. Legislation introduced by GOP lawmakers in at least seven states is aimed at banning or limiting mRNA vaccines. In some cases, the measures would hit doctors who give the injections with criminal penalties, fines, and the possible revocation of their licenses.

For business leaders, selecting employee health benefits is more than a numbers game — it's a strategic investment in your most valuable asset: your people.

For business leaders, selecting employee health benefits is more than a numbers game — it's a strategic investment in your most valuable asset: your people. According to a recent survey by the Society for Human Resource Management, 88% of employers ranked health-related benefits as “very important” or “extremely important,” prioritizing it above retirement savings, leave, family care, education, and transportation benefits. A well-structured benefits plan can improve workforce productivity, reduce absenteeism, and enhance overall job satisfaction.

Private equity-backed healthcare companies are underperforming when it comes to preventing and responding to cyberattacks, according to a new report from Clearwater Security.

“Firms that proactively address cybersecurity can reduce liability, strengthen resilience, and not only protect but also accelerate revenue growth and create long-term value,” Clearwater CEO Steve Cagle said in a statement.

Nashville, TN-based company said it found “systemic gaps” in security preparedness among private equity-backed healthcare companies.

“Private equity firms need to consider the cybersecurity risk profiles of companies when deciding whether to acquire them or merge them with other businesses,” according to the report.

Cybersecurity weaknesses can threaten an entire portfolio, Clearwater found.

Using HHS' 405(d) Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices framework, the security company examined the top cybersecurity practices necessary to mitigate threats, such as:

The findings showed that many PE-backed healthcare companies lack a formalized incident response plan or rely on outdated procedures and that they do not conduct regular tabletop exercises, “leaving them unprepared for ransomware and system outages,” according to the report. In addition, the companies often lack organized recovery processes, which affect downtime and financial losses.

In addition, Clearwater noted weak data classification, inconsistent encryption and limited insider threat monitoring among the firms.

“Cybersecurity and resilience capabilities are creating winners and losers. Firms who are [making] cybersecurity a standard part of due diligence, perform ongoing risk analysis and align cybersecurity goals to their investment strategy are winning, as they are more competitive in the market while also avoiding costly breaches, regulatory penalties and post-acquisition surprises,” Cagle said. “We see winning private equity firms taking a proactive approach to ensuring their portcos [portfolio companies] have effective cyber risk management programs in place.”

On Sunday, pet owners in Paso Robles sought out care for their animals during the C.A.R.E.4Paws Pet Wellness Clinic's first-ever visit to North County San Luis Obispo.

The non-profit's community-focused event brought essential services to pets in need.

Owners were able to get vaccinations, flea treatments, and health check-ups for their pets at a reduced cost.

Organizers say the mobile clinic aims to support local pet owners and ensure their furry companions have access to vital healthcare.

"Vet care is getting more and more expensive. So the fact that C.A.R.E.4Paws can bring our mobile units and our team out directly in the community to provide low-cost care helps pets stay healthy and with their families for life," Isabelle Gullo, the C.A.R.E.4Paws co-founder and executive director, told KSBY.

If you missed Sunday's Pet Wellness Clinic, C.A.R.E.4Paws is hosting many more across the Central Coast this month.

You can find the full schedule on the organization's website.

Jack Draper and Mirra Andreeva have both just made huge statements on the ATP and WTA tours respectively, having both triumphed at Indian Wells.

Draper admits there is still room to improve after his Indian Wells success, where he beat Holger Rune 6-2, 6-2 in their final in the desert.

Andreeva has been likened to Carlos Alcaraz, with the Russian having defeated Aryna Sabalenka 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 in their final.

Both Draper and Andreeva have achieved career-high rankings following their Indian Wells titles, with the former seventh and the latter sixth in the ATP and WTA respectively.

The Briton has climbed a huge seven places following his triumph, while the Russian is up five places after her brilliant tournament.

And both players have earned the praise of tennis legend Chris Evert, who also shared her verdict on the current state of the men's and women's games after the hard-court tournament in California.

“Wow!” former world number one Evert wrote on X. “Mirra Andreeva and Jack Draper… Their future is right now and tennis is looking better than ever! Congratulations.”

Wow! Mirra Andreeva and Jack Draper… Their future is right now and tennis is looking better than ever! Congratulations 👍👏 @BNPPARIBASOPEN

Both Draper and Andreeva really have come on leaps and bounds in recent times, with their final victories just part of their superb Indian Wells stories.

The British number one knocked out a long list of hugely talented players on his way to another career title, including second seed Alcaraz.

And Russian teenager Andreeva, who remarkably is only 17, saw off top 10 players Elena Rybakina and Iga Swiatek before beating world number one Sabalenka.

It really is an exciting time for tennis, where the next generation of stars are quickly becoming the players to beat.

And their success also caught the attention of another legend in Rod Laver, who wrote on X: “Congratulations to Jack Draper and Mirra Andreeva on capturing the singles titles at Indian Wells.”

And tagging the BNP Paribas Open, he said: “Thank you for having me – it marked another exciting episode in tennis and I can't wait to see what transpires in Miami.”

Georgia women's tennis adds another SEC win to its 14-1 record after defeating Ole Miss 4-1 on Sunday. This win marks the Bulldogs' 25th win over the Rebels in the last 28 matchups.

No. 13 Dasha Vidmanova and Mell Reasco had yet another strong doubles match against No. 50 Ludmila Kareisova and Anaelle Leclerq-Ficher. The pair of seniors defeated the Rebels 6-2.

Ole Miss' Emily Welker and Alice Soulie secured their doubles match against No. 75 Aysegul Mert and Hayden Mulberry, ending their six-match winning streak. After a 6-2 loss on court three, No. 70 Guillermina Grant and Anastasiia Lopata clinched the doubles point for Georgia, defeating Andrea Nova and Brooklyn Olson 6-4.

No. 82 Grant found success in singles play against Rachel Krzyzak, securing Georgia's first singles win with a 6-4, 6-2 win on court five. With the win, the senior extended her singles winning streak to nine matches.

The Rebels added their first point to the board after Reasco fell short to Lucie Petruzelova on court three. Petruzelova defeated Reasco in consecutive sets 6-4, 6-2. No. 48 Lopata, however, brought the score to 3-1 after finding victory against Kareisova 6-3, 6-2.

No. 1 Vidmanova clinched the match for Georgia on court one against Welker. Vidmanova had a dominant first set, securing a 6-0 win. Welker battled in the second set, but ultimately could not mount a comeback. After a 7-6(5) win in the second set, Georgia maintained its perfect record against SEC opponents.

At the time of Vidmanova's win, the match between No. 41 Mert and Alice Soulie was left unfinished. Mert had a strong first match, winning 6-1. Soulie found her momentum in the second set and forced a third set after defeating Mert 6-4. The third set was left unfinished at 5-0.

On court six. Sofia Rojas was also in a three-set battle against Emma Kette. Rojas defeated Kette 6-3 in the first set, but fell in the second set 6-4. The third set was left unfinished at 0-0.

Georgia will return to Athens to face No. 70 Arkansas at the Dan Magill Tennis Complex on Friday.

Led by Henry Hunter's two towering home runs and a seven-run third-inning explosion, Georgia defeated Kentucky 17-10 on Sunday, securing its first SEC series win of the season.

The decade-long drought is over.

The Athens Rock Lobsters got back in the win column after defeating the Baton Rouge Zydeco on Friday and Saturday, clinching the Commissioner's Cup Playoffs in the process.

In the last game of the series in Colombia, South Carolina, No. 13 Georgia softball was defeated 3-2 by No. 9 South Carolina, resulting in a series loss. Georgia's record fell to 21-6 overall and 2-4 in SEC play with the loss.

Welcome back to the Monday Tennis Briefing, where The Athletic will explain the stories behind the stories from the past week on court.

This week, Indian Wells dominated the tennis world, with 2024 champions Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek suffering similar fates but contrasting futures. Elsewhere, there was a top-10 reshuffle on the ATP Tour, three American women lining up in the WTA Tour top five and some retirees getting a nice new tournament.

If you'd like to follow our fantastic tennis coverage, click here.

Alcaraz and Swiatek arrived in Indian Wells as heavy favorites. They lost in three sets in the semifinals and their conquerors, Jack Draper and Mirra Andreeva, went on to win the titles.

It would be easy to draw parallels, but other than coming up short on a court where they are generally masterful, Swiatek and Alcaraz are at very different spots in their quests to reclaim their top form and top ranking. That starts with their headspace. Swiatek swatted a ball towards her box in annoyance during her semifinal. She looked frustrated during recent defeats and against Andreeva, as when they met in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, she failed to convert numerous inroads on her opponent's serve into break points and games. Swiatek has routed all comers and lost tight matches to eventual champions for most of the year, but the level she expects from herself is even higher.

Alcaraz wasn't happy with his loss to Jack Draper either, but he was irritated with how he went into the match more than how he played it, despite an aberration of a first set. He dominated the second and looked ready to roll through the third, before umpire Mohamed Lahyani fluffed a double-bounce call against Draper on a key point. Draper appealed both the decision and the idea that the call had affected Alcaraz through video review. He was successful on both counts and the delay checked the set's momentum and let Draper gather himself.

Draper also offered to replay the point, but Alcaraz said he hadn't been distracted in a news conference after the loss. Neither Swiatek nor Madison Keys, who won just one game against Aryna Sabalenka in their semifinal, did news conferences after their exits.

Alcaraz and Swiatek's paths diverge most strikingly in what comes next. Alcaraz has big opportunities to pick up points over the next few months. He won't be defending a title until the French Open, after a right arm injury heavily disrupted his clay-court season last year. Swiatek has a lot of defending to do. Once she gets done in Miami, the queen of the red clay will defend WTA 1,000 titles in Madrid and Rome before she seeks a fourth consecutive French Open title.

Head to Luxembourg in October and tennis fans will find the Luxembourg Ladies Tennis Masters, an event that offers recently retired professionals the chance to play in a competitive event as opposed to an exhibition doubles mostly staged for trick shots and banter.

Swedish entrepreneur Marten Hedlund has launched the Legends Team Cup to perform a similar role on the men's tour, but it comes complete with a $12 million (£10.1m) prize pool and player draft of the 18 former tennis professionals involved. They include former Grand Slam champions Dominic Thiem and Juan Carlos Ferrero, and former top-five players including Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

The event will be played in eight different venues across the world, starting in Saint Barths in the Caribbean in June before arriving at New York's UBS Arena from July 16 to July 18. Last week, the event announced that the legendary Bjorn Borg would join as the event's “Grand Master of Tennis,” a role as open as it is bombastic.

Having stayed out of the tennis spotlight for some time, Borg, now 68, has ensured he will remain visible in the sport for a bit longer and players at last year's Luxembourg event, including Grand Slam champions and former world No. 1s Martina Hingis and Ana Ivanovic, told The Athletic how much they valued having an event that isn't just a hit and giggle. The Legends Cup will have a go at another tennis format, though: matches will be capped at 45 minutes.

Three American women in the WTA Tour top five. Not too shabby.

Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula and Madison Keys are Nos. 3, 4, and 5 as they head to their home WTA 1,000 in Miami. All of them call Florida home, though only Gauff was raised there.

Can they stay in this rare air? That's a tough one to answer. Pegula missed the clay-court swing last year with an injury, so she has a lot of opportunities to corral points over the next few months. Keys is in good shape, too. Sabalenka ended her 16-match winning streak but Keys is a terrific clay-court player.

The biggest question mark could be Gauff. She is comfortable on clay, but she's the only one of the three who is reconstructing her game. She has changed her grip on her serve, which changes her motion; she's still figuring out how and when to play aggressively on her forehand, which has been an attackable weakness for too long. She's been willing to take the one-step-back-two-steps-forward approach but consequently, from match to match, even she doesn't know which version of herself will show up.

Matt Futterman

Last Thursday was the first time that an ATP Masters 1,000 or a men's singles Grand Slam draw had three semifinalists born in the 2000s, according to Opta.

Draper, Holger Rune and Alcaraz were the 2000s representatives, with only Daniil Medvedev from the 1990s cohort. The '90s generation, also known as the “sandwich generation,” was already squeezed between the Roger Federer-Rafael Nadal-Novak Djokovic axis and the rise of Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner; Draper and Rune also making good on their potential would squeeze them further. Medvedev is one of two male players born in the '90s to win a major; Thiem is the other.

Draper took out Taylor Fritz, another child of the '90s, on his way to the Indian Wells title, and his move into the top 10 could be followed by a resurgent Rune and Ben Shelton.

Top-10 '90s stalwarts, including Andrey Rublev, Casper Ruud and Medvedev, are starting to look over their shoulders as the demographics at the top of men's tennis shift.

In the first edition of Second Serve, a weekly snapshot of the tennis tour, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko looks at the success stories from Indian Wells.

Mirra Andreeva had an important apology to make right after winning the Indian Wells title.

Looking to her coaching team, she said sorry for being "as you like to say, a little brat" before her match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka.

It's easy to forget Andreeva is just 17. She is playing with the maturity of a seasoned professional - and already cleaning up at some of the biggest tournaments on the WTA Tour.

Having become the youngest player to win a WTA 1000 event when she triumphed in Dubai last month, she continued her form in Indian Wells and lifted the trophy on Sunday with her 12th successive victory.

Impressive, right? 

But her achievement is made even more remarkable by the fact she beat Iga Swiatek and Sabalenka - the world's top two players - over the weekend.

The way she regrouped after dropping the second set 6-1 to Swiatek was impressive, as was her mental fortitude after losing the first set of the final against Sabalenka.

No wonder the prodigiously talented teenager is being tipped as a future world number one - and Grand Slam champion.

Talk naturally leads to which Slam that is most likely to happen at, as it will with Britain's Jack Draper, who triumphed in the men's final.

In truth, it could be any of the four, as Andreeva possesses a skillset suited to any surface.

The Russian agrees, saying: "I like to play on clay, I like to play on hard, I like to play on grass. So I can say that all three of them are my favourites."

Draper beats Rune to win Indian Wells title

Teenager Andreeva 'runs like rabbit' to stun Sabalenka

When Sonay Kartal lost in Indian Wells qualifying, she checked out of her rented accommodation and expected to be flying out of California.

Plans quickly changed. The British number three was picked out as a lucky loser - a player who takes a place in the main draw despite being beaten in qualifying - and went on to enjoy a memorable fortnight.

A heavy defeat by Sabalenka ended the run, but Kartal climbs 20 places to a career-high of 63rd in the world rankings as a result.

While Kartal is the biggest mover, former world number three Maria Sakkari dropped 22 places.

Sakkari, who was defending points from her run to last year's Indian Wells final, has tumbled out of the top 50 for the first time since 2019.

On the men's side, Tallon Griekspoor jumped nine places to 31st in the world after causing a shock on his way to a first Masters quarter-final.

Few people gave the 28-year-old Dutchman a chance of beating top seed Alexander Zverev - especially given he had never beaten a top-five player in 18 previous attempts.

But Griekspoor, a talented player with a powerful baseline game, stunned an out-of-sorts Zverev in a comeback win and carried his momentum to reach the last eight.

Draper and Kartal were not the only British players to enjoy success in Indian Wells.

In the women's doubles, Olivia Nicholls reached her first WTA 1000 final alongside Slovakian's Tereza Mihalikova.

Nicholls, 30, has surged up the doubles rankings since forming a partnership with Mihalikova last May.

Despite their loss to Dutch-American pair Demi Schurrs and Asia Muhammad, British number one Nicholls has soared to a career-high 31st in the world.

Britain's strong stable of men's doubles players, led by Australian Open champion Henry Patten, all lost in the Indian Wells second round.

All-British pairs Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski, Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash, plus Jamie Murray joined Patten in an early exit.

From Indian Wells, we go straight to Miami for the second half of the 'Sunshine Double'.

This is another combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 event. It is the tier below the four Grand Slams and one of the most prestigious prizes in the sport.

Novak Djokovic, as ever, is one of the most intriguing storylines as the 24-time major champion looks to avoid a third straight defeat.

Defending men's champion Jannik Sinner is missing as he serves a three-month ban for a doping offence, though reigning women's champion Danielle Collins - who planned to retire last year before doing a U-turn - will return.

From a British perspective, Draper, Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter, Cameron Norrie and Draper are named in the main draw.

Starting on Tuesday, the Miami Open culminates on 29-30 March and is the final hard-court event before the season moves to the European clay-court swing.

With so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep across everything from one week to the next.

As part of BBC Sport's commitment to offer more for tennis fans, Second Serve will be your weekly round-up of the biggest talking points in the sport.

As well as the main talking point, you can see which ATP and WTA players are making significant progress - or struggling for form, how the British contingent are doing and what the next stops on the calendars are.

Draper beats Rune in Indian Wells final - highlights

When Jack Draper had to retire injured from his Australian Open match against Carlos Alcaraz in January, some people asked the same old questions.

Was the Briton's body built for success at the top of a physically demanding sport? Could he get over the line mentally in career-defining moments?

Eight weeks later, Draper has answered any lingering critics.

On Sunday, he won the biggest title of his career at Indian Wells. He has also cracked the world's top 10 for the first time.

This is how the 23-year-old has done it.

Draper was coping with a hip problem at the Australian Open and required a regular intake of painkillers to play.

He came through three gruelling successive five-setters to reach the fourth round - showing he had already improved his durability - but it eventually took its toll against Alcaraz.

Afterwards, Draper admitted he may need to manage what he described as hip tendonitis throughout the rest of his career.

More difficult choices had to be made.

The British number one skipped the Davis Cup tie against Japan and also pulled out of a tournament in Rotterdam in early February.

He returned later that month, finishing runner-up at the Qatar Open before heading to Indian Wells.

Ultimately, the "sensible" decision to retire against Alcaraz - and manage his workload since - has paid off.

Having greater belief in his body allowed the left-hander's technical and tactical talents to flourish in the Californian desert.

Consistent serving - a mixture of dangerous, swinging deliveries out wide and flatter, pacy serves - laid the platform.

His forehand switched from punchy to loaded with spin, keeping opponents guessing, while sharp footwork allowed him to stay in rallies longer.

Coach James Trotman, who has worked with Draper since he was a teenager, has been a driving force in his success.

"Jack has a way of playing that we should be looking to execute first and foremost," he told the ATP website., external

"A big part of [our] journey is to try and impose his weapons and take the racquet out of his opponent's hand."

Welcome to Second Serve - your new weekly tennis briefing

Former world number one Andy Murray might be in Novak Djokovic's coaching box nowadays, but the long-time flagbearer of British tennis continues to have an influence on Draper.

Two core pillars of the recently-retired Scot's team - physiotherapist Shane Annun and fitness coach Matt Little - are now part of Draper's inner circle.

Just two years ago, Draper was lamenting being known as "the guy who got injured all the time".

Building his fitness in the gym has allowed him to compete more regularly on the tour - instrumental in his rise up the rankings.

"Being away from home, waking up early on a daily basis – it's like groundhog day," Draper told BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller.

"Putting in hours and hours on the court, in the gym, in the ice bath at the end of the day when I don't want to.

"It's like a normal job. Some days you really enjoy it and other times you don't want to get out of bed.

"But you do it anyway and do it to the best of your ability because you know it is going to pay off on the big stage."

Off the court, Draper has spent nights in Indian Wells playing Monopoly Deal - a shorter version of the classic board game - and refuelling with healthy takeaways.

"As much as I enjoy playing, being around my team and doing the right thing, it's one thing saying you'll do the hard work and another to do it when you're tired and really don't want to," Draper added.

"That is what feels good when you're playing well on court."

Jack Draper won the third title of his career in Indian Wells and moved up to a career-high ranking of seventh in the world

Draper's rise over the past year has been solid and steady.

His first trophy came on the Stuttgart grass in June last year, followed by an ATP 500 hard-court title in Vienna in October.

His run to the US Open semi-finals captured the attention of the wider British public, although his nerves were illustrated by vomiting on court in a defeat by eventual champion Jannik Sinner.

Draper began seeing a "breathing coach" to help solve the issue, and he pointed to the way he came through the third set against Alcaraz as an example of his improved composure.

"I had a few doubts before the Indian Wells final wondering if would feel the same things - but I didn't," he said.

"I was really strong and focused on my breathing and things I could control. That's what I was really proud of."

The next step from Masters champion is a logical one - becoming a Grand Slam champion.

Winning Indian Wells is no guarantee of future major success but as Dominic Thiem, Naomi Osaka and Bianca Andreescu have shown, coming through a 96-player field of the very best opponents is a strong indicator.

Hard courts have been Draper's most successful surface, but the next two majors are on the French Open clay-courts and Wimbledon grass.

So far he has struggled on clay, but his improved footwork should help, while the increasingly dangerous serve and groundstrokes are suited to grass-court success.

"I still feel I have a lot to prove on the clay," Draper added.

"I didn't get it going last year, but I don't see why I can't be pushing the best players on that surface.

"As for grass, I feel my game has improved massively since last year."

The Princess of Wales has congratulated Jack Draper on the biggest win of his tennis career and praised his “fantastic performance”.

Kate, patron of the Lawn Tennis Association, tennis's governing body, paid tribute to the British number one on social media after he was crowned Indian Wells champion.

The future queen said in her post on X, which was signed off with her initial C: “Congratulations, Jack. A Fantastic performance. Well Done. C”

Congratulations, Jack. A fantastic performance. Well Done. C 👏 🏆 https://t.co/z6rwNQEUDL

— The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) March 17, 2025

The message also featured applause and trophy emojis.

Kate is a keen tennis fan and an accomplished player who regularly attends the Wimbledon Championships in her role as LTA patron.

Draper, 23, defeated Dane Holger Rune in straight sets to be crowned Indian Wells champion and win his first ATP Masters 1000 title in the tournament held in California.

He powered past Rune 6-2 6-2 in a final staged in California that lasted just an hour and eight minutes.

A life in tennis seemed inevitable for Draper considering his father Roger was the chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association between 2006 and 2013 and his mother Nicky was an accomplished junior player.

A run to the Wimbledon boys' final in 2018 showcased his full potential, but his transition on to the professional tour was troubled.

He found it tough to adapt to the grind, while later battling injuries, and he admitted he thought about quitting.

“It's really difficult. It's not the sort of strawberries and cream of Wimbledon that I expected,” he has said about life on the tour.

But victory means Draper, who beat world number one Carlos Alcaraz in the last four, is set to rise to a career-high number seven in the world rankings.

After his win, Draper said: “It's definitely a big moment for me, getting inside the top 10 and to win my first Masters title just adds to my inner belief and confidence.”

SETERMOEN, Norway — The Norwegian Army has dropped tennis balls on tanks to test new attack strategies for drones, drawing on tactics seen on the battlefields of Ukraine.

Officials staged the evaluation as part of NATO exercise Joint Viking 2025, held in Northern Norway earlier this month. The idea was to test intelligence and surveillance tactics involving the deployment of different types of unmanned aerial vehicles.

Among them were first-person-view drones, or FPVs, used by Ukrainian and Russian forces to attack enemy positions or equipment. Skilled operators have been able to steer the remote-controlled drones into the open hatches of tanks and armored vehicles, blowing up their deadly charge inside.

In the context of the exercise, the drones carried tennis balls to simulate munitions hitting Norwegian armored vehicles, according to Maj. Tor Sellevold, who works for Combat Lab, the Norwegian Army's land warfare centre testing unmanned technologies.

“To simulate attacks on participating forces, tennis balls were dropped and FPVs were flown in dive attack patterns to simulate modern-day drone threats — the purpose was to provide insights to the participants of their own aerial signature, experience the threat from top-attack drones, and evaluate their standard operating procedures,” he told Defense News in an email.

Over 30 tennis balls were dropped during the ten sorties the FPVs carried out, he added. This represented the first time that the Norwegian Army conducted such testing with attack drones at that scale.

In Ukraine, cheap drones have proven increasingly capable of striking larger Russian platforms, such as combat helicopters, as a result of their fast-paced development, which now allows them to fly faster and further than at the start of the conflict.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense recently announced the creation of the Drone Line project, which seeks to establish a 15 kilometer unmanned “kill zone” along the front lines. The plan entails the deployment of a mix of surveillance and strike drones.

The Norwegian military has been paying close attention to all the developments ongoing in Ukraine regarding drone warfare.

As part of its operations, the Army's military intelligence battalion plans to operate drones from further back from the battle space, an officer within the unit, who wished not to be named, told Defense News.

“Our unit [Norwegian Army's military intelligence battalion] will not be operating them close to the frontlines, we will do so from a larger distance back with longer-ranges ones,” the officer said in an interview during Joint Viking.

Norway plans to acquire new drones that will be more suitable to operate in Arctic conditions, with “very long-range” cameras, the officer added.

During the exercise, another drone that the unit deployed to conduct surveillance missions was the U.S.-made Puma, manufactured by AeroVironment.

World number two Iga Swiatek has made the headlines again after experts claimed that the tennis star 'doesn't know real life' as she lost her temper during the Indian Wells semi-final.

The Pole came under fire after she smashed a ball at a ball kid following her devastating loss to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva 7-6 1-6 6-3, who reached the tournament's final for the first time.

Swiatek appeared to smash the ball back into the ground towards the ball kid after the tennis star was thrown it as she was on serve.

The ball kid was able to evade the ball as it bounced into the crowd, followed by a hostile reaction from those in attendance, who booed the Polish player.

However, Eurosport expert Tomasz Wolfke has now claimed, via SuperExpress, that her recent struggles may be related to her lifestyle off the court.

'She doesn't know real life,' he said. 'I don't remember anyone seeing her at a disco, all dressed up, having fun with friends.

'Maybe it's not a convent life, not that much, but it's definitely rare. Tennis will be a profession for her for a dozen or so years, but she's probably good at it - he admitted.' 

His comments came after the WTA rankings were updated on Monday, with Swiatek still number two but significantly lower than Aryna Sabalenka, who has 9,606 points.

The Polish star has endured a challenging time on the court and lost all five of her semi-final appearances since triumphing in the French Open in June 2024.

Tennis legend Boris Becker has also commented on Swiatek's behaviour during the disappointing semi-final.

'Iga got little angry…' he wrote on X (formerly Twitter).

Andreeva, meanwhile, achieved the end of her path to Indian Wells triumph as the 17-year-old player defeated world number one Aryna Sabalenka.

The Siberia-born star fought back for a 2-6 6-4 6-3 victory in her second successive title after clinching a trophy in Dubai at the end of February.

She became the youngest champion in WTA history at this level and has risen to sixth place in the world rankings.

The Briton has risen up to No 7 in the world following his triumph

Jack Draper has claimed the biggest victory of his career with a dominant performance at the Indian Wells Open.

The 23-year-old Briton secured his first Masters 1000 title with a commanding 6-2 6-2 win over Denmark's Holger Rune on Sunday night.



The triumph earned Draper a massive £930,000 payday for his two weeks' work in Palm Springs.

He becomes just the fifth British man to win a Masters 1000 title, joining Andy Murray, Cameron Norrie, Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski in this elite club.

The victory also propels the Sutton lefthander to a career-high world ranking of No 7.

Draper's victory was swift and decisive, taking just 68 minutes to dispatch Rune.

The Briton fired 10 aces at his stressed-out opponent, who appeared below par throughout the contest.

Draper broke Rune's serve twice within the first 14 minutes to race to a 4-0 lead.

He secured the first set in just 29 minutes amid breezy conditions in the Californian desert.

The dominance continued in the second set with an early break of serve.

Draper's performance was so impressive that at one point, Rune applauded a forehand winner from his opponent.

The victory came less than 24 hours after Draper defeated Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-final.

After his victory, Draper sank to his knees and pointed both fingers to the sky in celebration.

"It's incredible. I wasn't expecting this. I put in a lot of work over time," he said.

"I feel like I deserve this in all honesty. The amount of adversity I have been through, the amount of sacrifices, the amount of time all the people around me have put into me...

"To be here now and to say I will be seven in the world, I cannot tell you how much that means to me."

Draper's fortnight of consistent tennis has catapulted him to just 60 points behind Novak Djokovic, who sits fifth in the world rankings.

This represents the most consistent tennis of his professional career to date.

"All the work I have done over the last few years, it feels like it's coming together on the big stage," Draper reflected.

"I knew that Holger would come out and play some good tennis. I needed to be aggressive and play to win from the first ball. I did an amazing job of that."

This victory will have enormous reverberations throughout the year for Draper.

He will now be viewed within the tennis world as a genuine Grand Slam contender.

This new status comes at a perfect time with Wimbledon less than four months away.

The prize money for the Indian Wells tournament has been revealed, with the men's champion taking home more cash than their female rivals.

For the first time since 2009, the prize money at the 2025 BNP Paribas Open is not being distributed equally between the ATP and WTA Tours, with a 2.13% difference between the two.

The total combined prize money was $19,387,080, with the ATP Tour receiving $9,693,540 and the WTA Tour receiving $9,489,532. This represented a rise of 6.63% from 2024.

But the WTA Tour has confirmed that they have opted to give their champion less money than the ATP Tour Masters 1000 winner at the same venue.

So while men's champion Jack Draper collected $1,201,125 for his breakthrough maiden ATP Masters 1000 title, women's champion Mirra Andreeva received $1,127,500.

The difference in cash distribution is also reflected across the draw, with losing finalists in the men's tournament getting $638,750 and the women's runner-up earning $599,625.

Losing semi-finals in the men's event get $354,850 in prize money, which is a little more than the $333,125 female last four players collect.

The WTA Tour opted to give more money to players who go out in the earlier rounds of the competition, with players knocked out in the first round getting $30,801 and second round losers collecting $43,050. Those figures are more than the male players who were knocked out early in the California desert.

This variable prize money distribution will not be reflected at the Miami Open that gets underway imminently, with prize money in the second part of the ‘Sunshine Double' equal for the ATP Tour and WTA Tour events:

Miami ranking points and prize money

First round: 10 points | $23,760
Second round: 35 points | $35,260
Third round: 65 points | $60,400
Round of 16: 120 points | $103,225
Quarterfinals: 215 points | $189,075
Semifinals: 390 points | $332,160
Finalist: 650 points | $597,890
Champion: 1000 points | $1,124,380

With the WTA Tour generating a lot less revenue than the ATP Tour in broadcast revenue, it is tough for many tournaments to pay equal prize money when they are hosting men's and women's events.

All four Grand Slam tournaments pay men and women the same money, even though one plays best-of-five-set matches and the other only competes over three sets.

It means that male players need to stay on court for longer to earn the same amount of money, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal offering his comments on the equal pay debate last year.

“I don't want to be hypocritical and say things that are easy to say and that I don't feel. What do you want me to say? For me, the investment for women should be the same as for men,” said Nadal.

“The opportunities, the same. The salaries, the same? No, for what? It's not unfair, what's unfair is that there isn't equal opportunity.

“I have a mother and a sister. If you tell me that men and women deserve the same opportunities, I'm a feminist. This term is taken to the extreme. If we're talking about logical and normal things in this conversation, of course I want equality.

“For me, equality isn't about giving away gifts, but if Serena Williams earns more than me, I want her to earn more than me. I want equality, I want women to earn more than men if they generate more than men.

“What bothers me is when people tell me that income and earnings should be equal. In tennis, for some reason, the payouts are almost equal in most events because at the time there was an opportunity for women's tennis to be seen.

“Women's tennis is very popular around the world. I don't want to get into a fight about this, the problem for me is the discussion.”

In Mallorca, 15-year-old Indian tennis prodigy works at Nadal's academy, far from the apathy of Indian tennis administration.

A few weeks back, pictures emerged of Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi meeting Rafael Nadal while training at his academy in Mallorca. It was also reported that the Spanish superstar congratulated the 15-year-old on her remarkable run at last month's WTA event at Mumbai. This was a much-needed ray of hope for fans during a particularly lean run for Indian tennis.

Maaya, just 15, became the first player born in 2009 to reach the semifinal of a WTA event at the Mumbai 125k. A few weeks later, she packed her bags to move to the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, where she will spend at least one year. Having already made her first strides on the tour at such a young age, and securing a place in a prestigious international academy where she can hone her talent and build a European base to play tournaments, the future looks bright for a real talent to emerge from the country.

But the real hard yards are what lies ahead. Living a life on the road away from her father and committing to tennis full-time at such a young age comes with its own challenges. If she is to continue training and playing abroad, with little to no administrative support, the financial costs will rise to levels that will be hard for her family to maintain. The grind of transitioning to the tour has eaten up many promising juniors in the past. And doing it where she is now will be no cakewalk; Spanish academies – having produced generations of tennis superstars – are famed for unique and creative, but also tough, training regimens.

“It's a lot of tactical work,” Maaya tells The Indian Express from Mallorca. “After a certain level of tennis, I think that's what good coaching is, learning the right tactics and using them in your natural game. It's a great environment here, I'm learning to be a professional.”

At 15, Maaya seems to be breaking the mould for a prodigal Indian athlete.

Her baseline play and movement are solid and so is her court craft – top-level women's tennis is becoming less about the variety of the arsenal and more about finding the opportune moment to use weapons wisely. But her consistent temperament is eye-catching; staying cool under pressure has long been the Achilles' heel of Indian sporting prodigies.

Globe-trotting does not seem to bother her; she does not seem to mind spending her formative teenage years in a foreign country among new people in an alien culture. When asked what does, she begins to show her young age for the first time.

“The toughest thing is that I miss my father,” she says. “I'm very close to both of my parents. I live with my mom, we have rented an apartment here, but I travel around and I play, so it's not possible for my dad to come everywhere. Staying away from him for a very long time is tough.”

Based out of Coimbatore, Maaya picked up a racquet as an after-school activity at the age of 8. By 11, she and her parents knew the goal was to turn professional. The immediate goal also became to send her abroad.

For players like Maaya, an early commitment to a career in tennis can be daunting. The financial challenges can be extreme in a sport where funding is so often unglamorous. Lakhs of rupees can be spent scouring the globe to play tournaments where a tame first-round exit is a possibility. But that exposure is crucial for the development of a player at Maaya's stage of their career.

And in India, securing that funding takes place in an entirely personal capacity; administrative apathy is Indian tennis's well-publicised legacy. From the Amritraj brothers and Ramesh Krishnan in the 1970s and 80s, to Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi in the 90s, to Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna this century; each of Indian tennis's success stories stem from stray sponsors and familial dedication; existing outside the system, not within it.

And Maaya's case is no different. Her parents – her father works at an MNC and is the sole breadwinner of the family – have solely supported her dream in her initial years. After she showed promise on the junior tour, sponsorships came in, the first of which was from an anonymous benefactor.

“I didn't even know their name yet. But they are sponsoring us through the trust that Maaya's coach, Manoj Kumar, set up,” Maaya's mother, Revathi, says. “It started when it was only us – when we started out we had to sell some properties and burn our savings – but slowly after that, it (Maaya's support and funding) has become quite professional.” The 15-year-old is now sponsored by companies like TVS, LG, and American Steels.

Even aside from just paying for coaching, nutritionists, and travel, India does not even contain a high-quality training facility. The National Tennis Center (NTC) was opened by the All India Tennis Association (AITA) in 2020 with the idea of creating a talent pipeline and harnessing the talent they produced – a de-facto high-performance center. Not only were those heady dreams never achieved, amid an ongoing court case over the validity of the federation's latest election results due to an alleged breach of the National Sports Code, the NTC also shut down earlier this year.

With the system set up for young players in India to fail, the moment they show promise, they attempt to secure a ticket to a foreign academy. India's most promising junior men's player, 17-year-old Manas Dhamne, is currently training at the Piatti Center in Rome – the same academy that gave Jannik Sinner, the current World No. 1, his start.

A lack of domestic administrative support has not deterred Maaya and her family's dedication towards making her a top tennis pro. “So far, we have never missed anything,” Revathi says.

Maaya is almost forceful in her positivity about the decision to become a tennis player. “I want to do this because this is what I love and this is what I'm good at. I love to compete. That is why I am pursuing a career in tennis. And I know I'm lucky, because my parents respected that decision. Not everyone does,” the 15-year-old says.

For months, domestic Indian tennis circles had been buzzing about Maaya's talent before the semifinal run in Mumbai last month. She entered what was only her fifth professional tournament with a qualifying wildcard and won five matches in a row. It was her first breakthrough in the rankings, and she landed at the World No. 646 spot, making it a top 20 highest-ranking for a debutante (that list includes Monica Seles and the Williams sisters.)

Impressive as her achievements are, Maaya's early success is magnified because Indian tennis has had very little hope of late. Sumit Nagal is the only player, man or woman, to be a singles presence at the Grand Slams. More and more players, at a younger age, are veering towards doubles in search of playing opportunities and success.

That expectations are already being harboured of Maaya, does not seem to add to the pressure.

“To have so much crowd support and to have so many people asking about you can only be a good thing,” Maaya says. She is currently preparing to play a few junior ITF tournaments before the French Open juniors in May.



Crowd support is not the best part of playing in India though. It is getting to see her father and having a hit with him on court – a great way to settle a few arguments.

“He was always better than me, but now…”

Philomath News


					Local • Independent • Trusted				

Hit hard by graduation, transfers, other sports and a part-time job, the Philomath High boys tennis team enters this season with a roster of just 10 players — and only two of them bring back varsity experience.

As such, veteran coach Gary Quandt will be working this spring with a fairly green group of kids. Out of the PHS players that competed in the district tournament last year, only two of 12 are back on the local court.

“I've got a lot of newbies that have just been playing for two weeks,” Quandt said, adding that his expectations aren't very high for the season as far as how team results turn out because of the likelihood of forfeiting one, maybe two matches.

The Warriors do not return any singles players with the top two lost to graduation — state qualifier Andrew Leonard to name one — while another chose to play golf and the fourth transferred to Corvallis.

Among those who played doubles last season, junior Lane Schell brings back the most experience. Schell played at No. 1 doubles with the now-graduated Gradin Fairbanks. Senior Ahren Harris competed with No. 4 doubles at districts.


“Hands down my best player is Lane Schell and I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that,” Quandt said. “I may just rotate him around … maybe put him in doubles a couple of times, put him in singles and throw some other guys around. I really don't know what my lineups are going to be — I have to be very flexible and see what happens.”

Elsewhere, sophomores Jayden Pope and Kayden Reynolds return but they were used sparingly over the course of the season. The rest of the roster features two more sophomores in Nate Houck and Elijah Robinson along with four freshmen — Cedric Gaskey, Samuel Holroyd, Laurence Mielke and Mika Laukkanen Raskauskas.

Quandt's return as head coach was in question as PHS advertised the position after last year's campaign. At one point, it appeared that a new coach had been hired but that ultimately did not work out and Quandt had always told the school that he would continue coaching if the program needed him. He did confirm last week that this will be his last season of coaching.

“I don't know how much success we'll have but at least they'll enjoy it and get some skills,” Quandt said about the upcoming season. “Maybe next year, they can get a full team together and get a coach. That's my hope anyway.”

Philomath is scheduled to open the season, weather permitting, at 4 p.m. Tuesday at home against 5A Lebanon.

“We only have the one match and then we have Spring Break and come back and start our matches with a vengeance after that,” Quandt said. “So that'll give me an extra week or so to get the kids in playing shape.”

Quandt does see potential on the roster.

“There's some kids that with some time, they can be pretty fair players,” he said. “It's going to take some time and it's not going to happen this year but hopefully they have a positive experience and want to keep playing.”

After the season opener, Philomath will have six other matches on the home courts. The district meet will take place at Estacada for the early rounds before moving to Salem.

“Hands down my best player is Lane Schell and I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that,” Quandt said. “I may just rotate him around … maybe put him in doubles a couple of times, put him in singles and throw some other guys around. I really don't know what my lineups are going to be — I have to be very flexible and see what happens.”

Elsewhere, sophomores Jayden Pope and Kayden Reynolds return but they were used sparingly over the course of the season. The rest of the roster features two more sophomores in Nate Houck and Elijah Robinson along with four freshmen — Cedric Gaskey, Samuel Holroyd, Laurence Mielke and Mika Laukkanen Raskauskas.

Quandt's return as head coach was in question as PHS advertised the position after last year's campaign. At one point, it appeared that a new coach had been hired but that ultimately did not work out and Quandt had always told the school that he would continue coaching if the program needed him. He did confirm last week that this will be his last season of coaching.

“I don't know how much success we'll have but at least they'll enjoy it and get some skills,” Quandt said about the upcoming season. “Maybe next year, they can get a full team together and get a coach. That's my hope anyway.”

Philomath is scheduled to open the season, weather permitting, at 4 p.m. Tuesday at home against 5A Lebanon.

“We only have the one match and then we have Spring Break and come back and start our matches with a vengeance after that,” Quandt said. “So that'll give me an extra week or so to get the kids in playing shape.”

Quandt does see potential on the roster.

“There's some kids that with some time, they can be pretty fair players,” he said. “It's going to take some time and it's not going to happen this year but hopefully they have a positive experience and want to keep playing.”

After the season opener, Philomath will have six other matches on the home courts. The district meet will take place at Estacada for the early rounds before moving to Salem.

Rachel Zegler is paying tribute to the original Snow White.

The actress, who plays the Disney Princess in the upcoming live-action remake, took to Instagram to honor Adriana Caselotti, the actress who voiced the character in the 1937 animated classic film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

"just had to pay homage to the original snow white, miss adriana caselotti, to whom i owe everything," Zegler wrote.

The carousel includes a photo where Zegler styled her hair with curls and a red bow clip. After that is a black-and-white photo of Caselotti sharing a similar hairstyle. Rounding out the post is a video of Zegler, wearing the same ensemble, looking off to the side before staring into the camera and laughing.

Caselotti was named a Disney Legend in 1994. Thought of as Disney's first ingenue of the animated screen, she voiced both the speaking and singing voice of the animated princess. She died in 1997.

Gal Gadot stars alongside Zegler in the live-action remake. It arrives in movie theaters on March 21.

The date for Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour stop in Las Vegas has been released.

On Monday (March 17), Bey announced that she will be headed to Vegas to perform at Allegiant Stadium on July 25 as part of her Cowboy Carter tour.

Live Nation confirmed the addition on Monday and noted that Bey's highly anticipated tour is 94 percent sold out amid rumors that the 35-time Grammy winner was struggling to sell tickets.

Fans can get early access to the Vegas tickets through the BeyHive presale, which runs from Thursday (March 20) through Sunday (March 23). Artist presale begins March 24 and ends March 25. Citi cardmember and Verizon Access presales begin Friday (March 21) and run through March 23.

The newly announced Vegas date comes after Bey shared a flyer advertising the Cowboy Carter Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour that highlighted Sin City as one of the stops. Fans speculated that the singer might be performing at The Sphere in Vegas after the initial ticket drop didn't include the city.

During her Cowboy Carter tour, Bey will also be heading to stadiums in New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Atlanta, Washington D.C., Paris, London, and Chicago. Beyoncé is set to perform songs from her latest album, which took home three Grammys last month.

Tom Cruise and Ana de Armas have been seen together a few times over the last few weeks, and it has left some wondering if they are dating.

The 62-year-old Top Gun actor and the 36-year-old Blonde actress were seen out to dinner before Valentine's Day, and again seen taking a helicopter ride together last week.

Now, a source is revealing the truth about their relationship.

Head inside to find out more...

The insider told People they are not together romantically but are "teaming up on an upcoming project." In addition, they were not alone on the helicopter, but were joined by director Doug Liman. The title of this project is not yet clear.

Ana has most recently been romantically linked to Manuel Anido Cuesta, the stepson of Cuban president Miguel Diaz-Canel. They were spotted holding hands during an outing in Madrid, Spain back in December after being linked a month prior.

The White Lotus committed to the incest bit, but what happens between Sam Nivola and Patrick Schwarzenegger‘s characters from here?

During the Sunday, March 16, episode of the hit HBO series, Lochlan (Nivola) and Saxon (Schwarzenegger) party with Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) — but that quickly takes a turn when they finally act on that concerning tension between them by sharing a kiss.

“Without spoiling too much, everything changes for my character. It was basically like there's two versions of me. There's before that and after that, and that was a really important thing,” Nivola, 21, told GQ on Sunday. “Of course, the way it's edited and the way it looks, it is really sort of raunchy and there's moments leading up to that are really sexually charged. But I think really that's supposed to be a red herring for the audience where really it's just [that] Lochlan just wants attention and he just wants his brother to like him.”

Nivola acknowledged that Lochlan “gets really f—ed up and does something terrible” as a result.



“We didn't really talk about it at all until we shot the scene. My character's big turning point is that moment at the end of episode 5,” he continued. “We shot it a few different ways, and we talked about it a lot. I think at the end of the day, it was supposed to just be like they're all really f—ed up, and, of course, kissing your brother is incredibly wrong and weird and gross. But I think as is the case with The White Lotus, it's like these crazy actions and sort of heightened reality coming from really real emotions that are actually really relatable to your everyday guy.”

Before the show acted on the weird vibes between the brothers, Lochlan and Saxon's relationship was already called into question. Saxon notably asked Lochlan about his porn preferences just before he walked around naked in front of his younger brother. Lochlan, for his part, appeared intrigued by Saxon's advice while seemingly questioning his sexual identity.

“He just is desperate for his brother's approval, and he's out doing this partying drug thing with Saxon, which is a thing that Saxon keeps talking about, and all he talks about is sex. He's like, ‘Sex is the main point of life. You need to get laid. That's what you need,'” Nivola explained. “I'm like, ‘OK. Well, in this charged sexual environment, what can I do to make you notice me and get you to approve of me?' And then, he does the wrong thing to make that happen.”

Nivola called the moment “really complicated” for his character going forward.

“What we wound up deciding is we're going to let our instincts and [creator] Mike [White]‘s direction take the reins and let the audience interpret this weird thing that we have going on, because that's the way of movies and TV,” he detailed. “And also, the way Mike directs is very loose, which I love. He never comes into a day of work like, ‘This is exactly what I want, and if I don't get that, I'm going to be mad.'”

Nivola continued: “He's always coming up with ideas. So you as the actor have to really be yourself, not married to anything. You have to be ready to adapt and change your performance depending on what he winds up choosing on the day. So we also didn't want to make any hard and fast decisions about what we wanted the dynamic to be until we were on set.”

While Nivola couldn't give away where the story goes next, he was grateful for the chance to bring Lochlan to life, saying, “He's actually pretty similar to a lot of characters I've played. He's obviously awkward and virginal and young. It's definitely in my wheelhouse. … Basically Lochlan is a really, really insecure guy who is stuck between his siblings and just wants to be loved and will do anything to achieve that. I really relate to that. I mean, maybe not as desperately as him, but I think it's a very, very universal experience.”

New episodes of The White Lotus air on HBO Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

Queen Mary of Denmark recently came down with an undisclosed illness that forced her to cancel all upcoming appearances. 

The Danish Royal House's Communications Department issued a message in her absence, obtained by Daily Mail, that read: 

"Her Majesty the Queen, like many others right now, has become ill, and therefore unfortunately cannot participate in the Heart Association's award ceremony."

The Queen offered her thanks to citizens wishing her well and revealed why she was absent from her latest engagement in a post shared to Instagram last week. 

The message was accompanied by a photo of the beautiful flowers she received and "get well" drawings created by two children living with heart disease whom she met at the most recent Heart Association awards, per Daily Mail. 

Information regarding the current state of Queen Mary's health has yet to be revealed.

Lijomol Jose and Losliya Mariyanesan's Tamil crime thriller Gentlewoman is preparing for its digital release after its theatrical run. The film, written and directed by Joshua Sethuraman, was released in cinemas on March 7 and received mixed-to-positive reviews from audiences and critics. The storyline, which revolves around betrayal and revenge, struck a chord with viewers, leading to discussions about its intense narrative. After its stint in theatres, Gentlewoman is set to make its way to the streaming platform Tentkotta, providing audiences an opportunity to watch it online.

The film Gentlewoman will be available for streaming on Tentkotta, a platform known for hosting Tamil films. While an official streaming date is yet to be confirmed, reports indicate that the digital premiere will take place towards the end of March or early April. Fans who missed the theatrical release will soon have the chance to watch the thriller from the comfort of their homes.

The trailer of Gentlewoman set the tone for a gripping crime drama, showcasing the story of Poorni, played by Lijomol Jose, a newlywed woman trapped in an abusive marriage. Her husband, Aravind, portrayed by Hari Krishnan, not only mistreats her but is also involved in an affair with Anna, played by Losliya Mariyanesan. The plot thickens when Poorni discovers the betrayal and an altercation in the kitchen leads to Aravind's sudden disappearance. As the police begin their investigation, Poorni finds herself caught in a web of deception, forcing her to navigate a dangerous path filled with unexpected twists.

The film features Lijomol Jose and Losliya Mariyanesan in lead roles, supported by Hari Krishnan, R. Rajiv Gandhi, Dharani, Vairabalan, Nandithaa Sreekumar, and Sudesh. Produced by Komala Hari, Hari Bhaskaran, PN Narenthra Kumar, and Leo Logame Nethaji, Gentlewoman has cinematography handled by Sa Kathavarayan. The editing has been done by Elayaraja Sekar, while the background score and music have been composed by Govind Vasantha.

Since its theatrical release, Gentlewoman has received a rating of 7.9/10 on IMDb, reflecting a largely positive reception from viewers. Audience feedback highlights the film's engaging storyline and strong performances, particularly from Lijomol Jose. Critics have praised the screenplay and direction, though some reviews pointed out pacing issues in certain sections.

DUBLIN (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of people packed the streets of Dublin on Monday to watch Ireland's national St. Patrick's Day parade, as crowds in green flooded cities and towns across the country to honor the country's patron saint.

Officials said half a million spectators were expected to line the parade route in the capital to watch the colorful floats, performers and dancers. Many waved the Irish tricolor flag or had it painted on their faces, while others sported leprechaun hats and all shades of green.

Some 4,000 people and 12 marching bands from across Ireland, North America and Austria took part in the parade this year.

While the tradition of St. Patrick's Day parades first began among Irish immigrant communities in the United States in the 1700s, and the biggest parade these days takes place in New York City, officials say the holiday draws some 100,000 tourists to Ireland each year.

Smaller parades also took place in cities from Limerick to Cork and Belfast in Northern Ireland.

In London, Kate, the Princess of Wales, sported a forest green long coat with matching hat as she marked the occasion with a solo visit to the Irish Guards at Wellington Barracks.

The royal, who is the ceremonial colonel of the regiment, presented fresh shamrock sprigs and awarded medals to soldiers before the regiment's St. Patrick's Day parade. She enjoyed a half pint of Guinness afterward as she chatted and joked with the soldiers.

Kate, who missed the Guards' celebrations last year after she was diagnosed with cancer, has gradually returned to public duties.

Demi Lovato recently asked ChatGPT to roast their career and had fiancé Jutes read the savage response aloud. 

The "Confident" hitmaker shared the AI-fueled roast on TikTok and offered a hilarious reply. 

The pair laughed after the program referenced her 2021 feud with Los Angeles-based frozen yogurt shop The Big Chill concerning the supposed promotion of "diet culture," per Entertainment Weekly. 

"Like babes, just pick a lane or at least a consistent genre," Jutes continued. 

The songstress briefly paused before quipping, "So you think I'm a good singer?"

Fans sounded off in the comment section, commending Lovato for being so "real," remarking "Demi we love you always," and "A WIN IS A WIN."

The 98th Academy Awards has officially found its host — and it's a very familiar face.

It was announced on Monday (March 17) that Conan O'Brien will return as host for the 2026 Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, following up his successful stint as first-time host at the 97th Academy Awards earlier this month, per People. In true Conan fashion, the 61-year-old comedian celebrated the news by joking about the "only reason" he was returning to host.

"The only reason I'm hosting the Oscars next year is that I want to hear Adrien Brody finish his speech," he said in a press release, referencing the actor's lengthy Best Actor acceptance speech during the 2025 Oscars.

During his first time as Oscars host, the show drew in a five-year high of more than 19 million viewers who tuned in to watch O'Brien take on some of the year's biggest films and pop culture moments as well as see which of their favorite movies and actors took home awards during the night.

In addition to O'Brien, the Academy is bringing back executive producers Raj Kapoor and Katy Mullan as well as Jeff Ross and Mike Sweeney as producers, with the latter also serving as a member of the writing team. 

"We are thrilled to bring back Conan, Raj, Katy, Jeff and Mike for the 98th Oscars!" Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Janet Yang said in a statement. "This year, they produced a hugely entertaining and visually stunning show that celebrated our nominees and the global film community in the most beautiful and impactful way. Conan was the perfect host — skillfully guiding us through the evening with humor, warmth and reverence. It is an honor to be working with them again."

The 2026 Oscars will air on ABC Sunday, March 15, 2026.

Dax Shepard had a message for his listeners ahead of his podcast episode with Andrew Schulz.

“Today we have a guest that I've been following on Instagram for a couple years now,” Shepard, 50, said on the Monday, March 17, episode of the “Armchair Expert” podcast, before talking to cohost Monica Padman. “This is fun because you were on the fence about Andrew, about some of his comedy. And before he came, I said, ‘Come on in. We'd love to have you, but there'll be some pushback.' So this was a very unique and fun episode. You guys got to really hash it out.”



Shepard explained that this episode was “really political” despite the podcast typically trying to “avoid politics.”

“I was like, ‘There's no way we do this without going all in,'” Shepard recalled. “For me, it was very fun because we never do it. And also in the middle of it, I was like, ‘Yeah, this is why we never do it.' Because we're getting very granular about this policy or that and this year and whatever. But I thought it was thrilling to sit kind of on the sidelines and watch the whole thing.”

In the episode, Schulz's unfiltered humor was on full display. While discussing his new Netflix comedy special, Life, which addresses his journey to fatherhood with wife Emma, Padman asked Schulz about his joke about special needs children.

“I can say it because they're my embryos,” Schulz, 41, said of the R-word adding, “If I have r—— embryos, I can call them whatever I want. They're mine.”

Padman pointed out that Schulz doesn't have a child who has special needs, and could cross paths with an upset parent who saw the joke at his daughter's school.

When Padman asked whether he would “care” about a viewer being upset, Schulz replied, “Well it depends how they feel about it. If they see it and they're like, hey, that really hurt me and made me feel really uncomfortable. Then in that personal interaction, I'll feel bad that somebody was hurt by it, a person. … I don't feel bad about people telling me to feel bad on behalf of people that we don't even know if they feel bad.”

Elsewhere in the podcast, the trio began discussing trans rights.

“There's a thing that people don't say, which is, ‘Should they compete against [cis] women?' … No. But we can also say, ‘It sucks for them. That is so unfortunate that you're in that situation,'” Schulz said, to which Shepard replied, “Let's make a category. I actually am supportive of their right to compete, and I acknowledge that they're a woman. I want that right for them, but not at the expense of 20 other people.”

Schulz noted that “there's not even a room on Twitter for the little bit of empathy in the middle” when discussing these issues.

“So it seems so rigid and harsh, and we're getting things in 180 characters, or whatever the character limit is, there's room to be like, ‘Man it sucks as that person.' Because I do believe that there are trends with things. So I think that there are some young kids that are probably identifying as trans that might not actually be not only trans. … And then there are people who are trans. My guess is that competing in the Olympics is not even the top 100 of the things that those people care about. … And now they're the talking point of every show, and they're just out here going, ‘I'm just trying to be a barista at this thing and everybody who comes up wants to ask me if I should be a swimmer.' And you're like, ‘I don't give a f— about swimming.'”

For Schulz, he “loves” having conversations with people who share different views than him because his opinions “get sharper.”

“I'm like, ‘Oh, I'm hitting this too bluntly and I'm ostracizing all these people. I would do that with the trans athlete thing. I didn't have space for how much it must suck to be a trans person and not having anywhere to go, and just acknowledging that makes my opinion way more digestible.”

Schulz also addressed his friendship — or lack thereof — with Shepard's friend Jimmy Kimmel, whom he recalled was having a back-and-forth interaction with Aaron Rodgers. (Kimmel and Rodger's feud dates back to 2021, but was reignited in 2024 when the NFL player insinuated that the late night host should be worried about the names on Jeffrey Epstein's list. Kimmel slammed the allegations and threatened to take legal action. Rogers later said he wasn't “accusing” Kimmel of being on the list.)

“I felt like he started with jokes, and then Aaron had a joke, and then I think Jimmy got some real life circumstances that affected him. I think he got some death threats and that kind of s—,” Schulz explained. “There's a lot of crazy people out there. Then he made it not about jokes. I was like, ‘Yo, you opened the door with jokes.' He responded with jokes. And then you were like, ‘What you're doing is dangerous.'”

Schulz continued, “Jimmy is always someone who I've looked at and admired. He has iconic TV shows, comedy history. That to me, I felt a little let down. You clown this guy on national TV, on one of the biggest shows, he clipped you back. To me, I'm like, ‘That doesn't seem fair.'”

Schulz may not also have a fan in Shepard's wife, Kristen Bell. Shepard recalled the couple, who tied the knot in 2013, attending Schulz's show — and one joke that didn't land.

“I had Kristen on board, she was on the Andrew Schulz f—- train. And then this joke about abortion, you lost her,” Shepard recalled, to which Schulz replied, “Yeah, it wasn't a good joke. … It didn't have the silliness of the joke.”

Schulz explained that the idea behind the joke was “how many abortions is too many” for one person. “If it goes to, like, 20, I think that there has to be an intervention where it's like, ‘Alright, we gotta do something here.' The idea is the beginning of a joke. Making it silly is a joke,” Schulz said, to which Shepard explained Bell took issue with men not being included in the joke.

As they continued to discuss his controversial humor, Shepard said the first time he became “scared” for Schulz was during an alleged feud with Kendrick Lamar.

“He put out an album, and he had a line in it. He was like, ‘Don't ever let no white comedian talk about no black woman, that's law,'” Schulz said, claiming he “got confirmation” the line in Lamar's “Wacced Out Murals” was about him. “I didn't respond for weeks. I had to shoot my special, I didn't really care. That wasn't even the thing that bothered me about the line.”

Schulz continued, “The next line is, ‘And to the n—– that coon, the n—– that bein' groomed, slide on both of them.' … So slide is like assault or kill. I'm thinking, and the world is thinking, he's talking about Charlamagne and Alex Media, the two Black dudes that are on the show. So once you tell people to kill my friends, you get whatever I give you.”

Schulz noted that Lamar said a “stupid thing” to him, adding, “you don't tell your fans to kill two of my friends or slide or assault or whatever it is, even if it's not serious, you're putting that energy out there. So don't be surprised if you get some energy back.”

Schulz, who responded to the song, recalled people making the reply “racism so fast.” Schulz claimed that his response was “fair” after Lamar allegedly suggested for his “fans to kill my friends.”

“It's about as playful as a f— you, I'll kick your ass, that be done. But now I'm really worried about you because I'm like, ‘Well, he thinks that he's a rational person.' Kendrick is a national treasure. He's a Pulitzer Prize winning, couldn't be more talented or loved. And I'm going, ‘Bro, is this the fight you're going to pick? We gotta pick our battles. Is this the one?' You were fine.”

Chrissy Teigen offered a few choice words to haters in a new message calling out social media users who cannot keep their negative thoughts to themselves. 

The model and mother-of-four took to Instagram on Saturday (March 15) to relay her distaste, calling out people who relentlessly criticize her appearance. 

"Stop being miserable. Honestly like what happened to just thinking things? Remember thinking things? You'd go through a magazine, you'd be like, ‘Oh, that person looks like s***. Ugh, I would never have that haircut. Bleh, those teeth suck.' We all do it, but we used to do it to, like, magazines, and then we spit it out and it would go into the universe and it would disappear," she remarked in a lengthy rant shared to her Instagram Story (obtained by People). 

Teigen, wife to music sensation John Legend, proceeded to sarcastically mock haters before concluding: 

"Just say those things inside, in your head. Say them inside your big brain. Your big brain is so ready for all your thoughts, but you don't let them keep anything in because you're spewing them out. Keep those big, beautiful thoughts to yourself. Keep them inside."

Teigen did not zoom in on a specific instance that sparked the conversation but felt it necessary to offer a blanket note to haters amid a continuous stream of online ridicule.

The Belgian actor who won a top Cannes prize for her breakout role in “Rosetta,” Émilie Dequenne has died at 43

Belgian Actor Émilie Dequenne Dies at 43 of Rare Cancer, Report Says

Émilie Dequenne, the Belgian actor who won a top Cannes Film Festival prize for her breakout role in “Rosetta,” has died, a news report says. She was 43.

Her family and agent told the news agency Agence France-Presse that Dequenne died Sunday of a rare cancer in a hospital outside of Paris. In 2023, Dequenne revealed she had been diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma. Representatives for Dequenne did not immediately respond to inquires from The Associated Press on Monday. 

Dequenne was only 18 when she was selected as best actress at Cannes in 1999. In “Rosetta,” from Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, she portrayed a teenager trying to escape her difficult life in a caravan park with an alcoholic mother. The film also won the Palme d'Or that year.

Born in Belœil, Belgium, in 1981, Dequenne had a performance streak from a young age. She studied drama at the Académie de Musique de Baudour.

She became well-known in France after starring alongside Catherine Deneuve in “The Girl on the Train,” in 2009, based on the true story of a woman who falsely claimed she was the victim of an antisemitic attack. Dequenne also portrayed police officer Laurence Renauld on the French series “The Missing.”

In 2012, she won the Un Certain Regard actress prize from Cannes for “Our Children,” a dark psychological drama inspired by the real story of a Belgian woman who killed her five children. She was also nominated for several César Awards throughout her career, finally winning best supporting actress in 2021 for the romantic comedy “Love Affair(s).”

Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the difficult role in “Our Children,” she said, “For my part I went home every weekend, and stayed with my family, which is a very safe place. Making a film like that is something that you have to survive.”

More recently, she co-starred in “Close,” Lukas Dhont's tender boyhood drama, which brought her back to Cannes again in 2022. She saw similarities between her young co-star and her own breakout role with “Rosetta.”

“For me to be here and to come back here after 23 years, it's very emotional and there is like a reflection between Eden (Dambrine) and myself because I remember when I was here the first time with ‘Rosetta,'” she told The Associated Press. “It was like a very powerful movie with this main character, which is in every scene, every, every shot. And that's the same for him.”

Dequenne returned to the festival again in 2024 for the 25th anniversary of “Rosetta.” Her last film was Frédéric Jardin's post-apocalyptic thriller “Survive,” which came out earlier this year.

While she loved taking on work in England, France and Belgium, she had little interest in Hollywood.

“I have been to Hollywood and had meetings, but really they don't do the kind of films I like to make. And everything is kind of boring, no?” she said in the interview with The Guardian. “Honestly, it's not a fun place, or at least not my kind of fun.”

She is survived by her husband, director and producer Michel Ferracci, and daughter, Milla Savarese.

TORONTO - Longtime former "Breakfast Television" co-host Dina Pugliese is settling back into the chair.

Pugliese announced her return on the show Monday by stepping onto the set in a moose costume before removing the mascot-style head to raucous cheers from the crew.

Pugliese will also serve as a co-executive producer on the program, which she left in February 2023 after 16 years citing burnout.

Citytv says Pugliese will anchor the show alongside Tim Bolen, who hosted CHCH's "Morning Live" until earlier this year.

The move comes just over a month after "BT" hosts Meredith Shaw and Sid Seixeiro abruptly departed the show.

That move came just weeks after the network axed a planned extension to "Breakfast Television" that would have featured two other high-profile hosts, Cheryl Hickey and Tracy Moore.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 17, 2025.

The internet talks — and Rebecca Black has heard it all.

“I've heard just about everything,” Black, 27, exclusively told Us Weekly of the online rumors she has heard about herself. “When I was in high school and Tumblr was huge and all those anonymous forums were big, I remember there being a rumor … that I did coke off of a Book of Mormon.”



Black reiterated to Us that the rumor is “not true, to clarify if anyone's curious.”

“Not sure if that's fine to say,” she added. “But yeah, I've heard it all.”

Black — who is fresh off the release of her sophomore album SALVATION and the release of the music video for her single “TRUST!” — is no stranger to the entertainment business or the game artists often have to play to get recognized and remain relevant. After all, Black was just 13 when she released the music video for her viral song “Friday” in 2011, starting an online conversation that catapulted the singer into an overnight sensation.

“I mean, I think that the goal with anything that I make is just to start a conversation, whether it shocks people or not,” Black told Us. “I think if you watch the ‘TRUST!' video and maybe you haven't turned into what I've been up to for the last few years, maybe it would be shocking. But what I also love to see are people who have been around be like, ‘Nope, this has been going on. Makes sense. We're just pushing it to the next step.'”

She continued, “So I love to be part of that conversation and watch it go down and I'll continue to make what's exciting to me, regardless.”

In addition to releasing a new album, music video and starting even more online conversations — true or not — Black is also navigating life in the spotlight since coming out as queer in 2020.

“I just practice publicly,” Black told Us of her sexuality. “Not really a lot has changed [since coming out] other than I think I honestly felt — even before I came out, in the years that I was just being queer in my everyday life — a lot of my fans knew and my community was a lot smaller than maybe it is now.”

The singer added, “I think I have always had a really special relationship with all of the queer people in my life, regardless of my own [queerness]. I've always felt so grateful to the community for always accepting me before anyone else had.”

The “Friday” performer went on to explain that she now changes “the pronouns in my songs sometimes,” meaning she writes “with any pronoun.”

“I think my queerness has been something that has bred a lot of creativity,” Black explained. “But it's not the defining factor of what I want my music to be, either.”

SALVATION, Black's sophomore album, is out now.

Patrick Schwarzenegger is unpacking that kiss that went down in episode five of The White Lotus season 3.

Spoilers ahead if you haven't watched!

After the Full Moon Party, Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood), along with brothers Saxon (Schwarzenegger) and Lochlan (Sam Nivola), hang out on Greg's yacht. At one point, Saxon tells the women to kiss, and then they expect the brothers to do the same. After Saxon and Lochy share a little peck, Lochlan goes in for a much longer kiss, which appears to disorient and confuse Saxon.

Keep reading to find out what Patrick said about the moment and how it impacts the remainder of the season...

Of episode five, Patrick said that is where “everything starts to unravel.”

He then said Mike White, the show's creator, purposely wants the audience to try and figure out that kiss.

Patrick told Today, “He wants to leave that up to the interpretation of the audience of what is happening. Was a power shift happening? Is there a different power dynamic between him and Lochy? Is Lochy coming on to him? Is it the drugs? Is it the girls pressuring him? What is it? So, I think he leaves that open-ended for the audience to try to decipher.”

Of his character's remaining arc this season, Patrick added, "One of the themes really is you enter the White Lotus as one person and you leave as another. Who are you when everything that you thought you were is taken away? And I think that's something that's really relevant and prevalent for for Saxon. Him walking into the White Lotus as the most confident and sure person of who he is, and everything gets completely questioned in his experience there."

Find out if The White Lotus is canceled or renewed for another season.

overcast clouds

In the wide world of entertainment news, a new name rose in April 2024. TheScoopVilla.com arrived, bold and confident. It caters for those who have interest in the India and Hollywood stories, bringing them the news as they are. It is very young, but it is robust. The writers know their craft. They have honed their skills and have gained the experience of years in the trade of what matters and how to tell it. They write carefully, honestly and with an agenda on their minds to uncover the truth. Their words keep readers close, provide them what they need—Simple, powerful, and genuine.

The Scoop Villa stands apart. It tells the whole story. It does not miss a beat. For lovers of Bollywood, it brings much more than news. It dives deep. It talks about movies yet to be made, to trailers, to what lies behind the scenes. It observes, it listens, and it speaks what it sees. Hollywood also gets the same sharp eye. Feature films, shorts, the famous ones and the obscure ones. It accompanies the work from the beginning till the end and provides the readers with the news in the making. And always, the stars. The site follows them, Indian and beyond. It speaks with them. It depicts their lives, their lifestyle, and their moments. The fans have a right to know and The Scoop Villa provides them with the information. 

The Scoop Villa understands how people watch now. It follows the streamers. The films made for them. The shows that are watched when one is awake during the night. It gives an indication of what is worth watching and what is not. Television is not forgotten. The site observes the shows, analyses them, and gives an idea of what follows. It follows the seasons, the changes, the news that is of interest to the followers. But it is not only the screen, it is the entire world that has become a stage for the performance of the spectacle. The Scoop Villa looks beyond. It sees how people dress, how they live, what they use to be comfortable. It does not only tell fashion, beauty, or wellness; it tells those as well.

It is worth noting that many people do not believe what they read on the internet. A survey conducted in 2012 revealed that the majority of them (85%) had lost trust. The Scoop Villa knows this. It stands against it. It speaks the truth and does not bother with the clamour. The mission is clear. No wild stories. No empty words. Just the facts, straight and sure. And if there is an error, it is corrected. The Scoop Villa listens. It embraces the voices that are raised. There is an email for it. A complaint does not sit. It is handled, fast and fair.

The Scoop Villa knows Bollywood. It covers it well. But it does not stop there. It extends as far as the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia. It brings news to those who want it, to any corner of the world. It knows the local stories. It knows the world's interest. Collectively, they define it—clear, powerful, and for the lovers of entertainment.

It is quite new, but the people behind The Scoop Villa have the experience and knowledge of the game. All the writers have been practicing in the field for several years. They have learned what is important and how to express it. The site is rather new, but it is firmly rooted in the ground. For those who seek the news—actual and complete—it is a location one should be aware of. It includes movie, television, celebrities, and the way people live. It does this carefully, honestly, without any unnecessary words. The Scoop Villa is here to inform. It is here to last.

Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Naga Chaitanya may have separated from each other, but the discussion over them is not ending anytime soon. After about 4 years of marriage, both of them got divorced in 2021. At the same time, last year, Chaitanya married South Indian actress Sobhita Dhulipala and started his life afresh. After this decision of Chaitanya, now it seems that Samantha wants to erase all the memories related to her ex-husband. 






For the unversed, Samantha had already turned her white wedding gown into a black off-shoulder dress and her wedding ring into a pendent, but now it seems like the actor has also decided to erase the joint tattoos that the actors got together while they were married.

On Sunday, March 16, Samantha shared some glimpses of her upcoming film on her official Instagram account. In these pictures, the tattoo on her wrist has caught people's attention; two arrow tattoos are seen on the actress's wrist, which have faded to a great extent. This tattoo matches Naga Chaitanya's tattoo. This was a sign of her love with Naga Chaitanya. Let us tell you that years ago, both of them got the same design tattooed on their respective hands.





These pictures of Samantha are trending on social media. Social media users speculated that the actress had decided to remove it. In the comment section of Samantha's latest post, a fan wrote, 'Good, never get a tattoo of your partner's name, guys. You never know when the relationship will end, and removing a tattoo is painful.' Another user wrote, 'It's good for them.' Another user wrote, 'Hope you make a great start.'

Samantha and Naga Chaitanya tied the knot in 2017. Before marriage, both of them got the same design tattooed on their right hand, the meaning of this tattoo was, 'Create your own reality.' After their marriage, Chaitanya added their wedding date in Morse code to his tattoo. At the same time, Samantha got a tattoo of 'YMC' on her neck for her Telugu debut 'Ye Maya Chesaave', where she first met Chaitanya.

SPOILER ALERT - Do not read ahead if you haven't watched the new episode of The White Lotus!

Weeks after Ke Huy Quan made a voice cameo, another Oscar winner is making a surprise appearance on The White Lotus!

HBO released episode 5 of season 3 of the Emmy-winning series on Sunday night (March 16) and during the episode, a famous actor made an appearance as an old friend of Walton Goggins' character Rick.

Keep reading to find out more...As viewers recall, Rick is in Bangkok looking for the man who killed his father, who turns out to the owner of the White Lotus.

Rick meets up with an old friend who turns out to be Sam Rockwell!

Sam's character evidently owes Rick a favor, but he's now sober and found religion, so he's not interested in getting drunk with Rick.

“I also wanted to bring you what you asked for,” Sam's character said, as he slid a duffel bag to Rick's feet. “Hope you don't have to use that."

He then went on to explain why he's in Thailand.

“I took the partying thing as far as it could go,” Sam's character said.

“I moved here because I had to leave the States but I picked Thailand because I always had a thing for Asian girls and when I got here I was like a kid in a candy store. I got money, no attachments, nothing to do," he continued. "I started partying. It got wild, I was picking up girls every night, always different ones, petite ones, chubby ones, older ones, sometimes multiple ladies a night. I was out of control, I became insatiable and after about a thousand nights like I started to lose it. I started wondering where am I going with this. Why do I feel the need to f--k all of these women. What is desire?”

He then goes on to explain to Rick that he decided to let men have sex with him so that he can feel like "one of these Asian girls."

“We all have our Achilles heel. Why are some of us attracted to the opposite form? Sex is a poetic act, it's a metaphor," Sam's character continued. "Then I realized I gotta stop. I got into Buddism, which is all about spirit versus form, detaching from self, getting off the never-ending carousel of lust and suffering. Being sober isn't so hard, being celibate that's tough."

If you were unaware, Sam's real-life partner Leslie Bibb also stars on season 3 of The White Lotus playing Kate.

New episodes of The White Lotus air on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.

Justin Theroux has married Nicole Brydon Bloom.

The 53-year-old actor got engaged to Nicole, 30, in August 2024 after just over a year of dating and now they have tied the knot, according to TMZ.

The outlet obtained photos of the couple in Tulum, Mexico, where Justin was seen wearing a cream tuxedo and kissing Nicole as she danced in a traditional wedding dress.

The outlet claimed that the couple had to contend with windy weather conditions but claimed that they had it on "good authority" that the pair are now husband and wife.

The couple were first romantically linked in February 2023 and attended the Venice movie festival to promote his new film Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, which was released in September 2024.

They made their red-carpet debut as a couple in March at the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, wearing matching all-black outfits.

They were also photographed getting cosy on a night out in New York City in August 2023, and next month were spotted getting dinner with Nicole's parents.

Justin's exes include Friends actress Jennifer Aniston, 55, to whom he was married from 2015 to 2018.

The exes are said to have stayed friendly after their split and were spotted getting dinner together at the Il Cantinori restaurant in New York last April.

Justin told the New York Times about their break-up: "The good news is that was probably the most — I'm choosing my words really carefully — it was kind of the most gentle separation, in that there was no animosity."

Nicole is best known for playing Caroline Stuyvesant in season two of The Gilded Age, and has also appeared in Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, 1BR and We Were the Lucky Ones.

Michelle Monaghan is opening up about getting into character for The White Lotus!

On Saturday (March 15), the 48-year-old actress marked the halfway point in season 3 of the hit HBO series and revealed why she ditched her signature brunette hair for a blonde look to play Jaclyn Lemon.

Keep reading to find out more…“We're midway thru @thewhitelotus season three so it's about that time to talk all things #JaclynLemon glam! 🤩 Michelle wrote on Instagram. “Well we all know it takes a village with a lot of talent and inspiration.”

She then revealed that White Lotus creator Mike White is the reason why she went blonde and praised celeb hair colorist Tracey Cunningham for her achieve the look.

“When I first booked the gig, Mike White asked me if I would go blonde. Uh…YES! I'd shave my head for that man! Mike wanted the ladies to be ‘a big blonde blob,'” Michelle explained. “He wanted us to convey the look of sameness – an interchangeable trio of sorts prior to discovering the nuances of each character as the season progresses. Going blonde was wonderful creative inspiration for me but I'd need an epic colorist to make those locks a reality. Enter the queen @traceycunningham1 (thanks for the intro @mslesliebibb 😙)”

She added, “I easily deferred to Tracey's expertise. She and her incredible assistants meticulously perfected the color over the course of a few eight hour sessions. Moreover, Tracey maintained the color and the roots the entire six months we were in Thailand, making multiple trips to keep that mane oh so Jaclyn (and oh so healthy – thank you @olaplex). I'm so thankful to her, and her team, because let's be honest, blondes absolutely do have more fun.”

New episodes of The White Lotus air on Sunday nights at 9pm ET on HBO and are available for streaming on MAX.

Wendy Williams flashed a smile while out and about in New York City on Saturday evening.

Williams, 60, was seen heading to dinner at Tucci, an Italian eatery in the NoHo district of Manhattan. The talk show host, who suffers from Graves disease and lymphedema, used a mobility scooter to maneuver through city streets.

Williams' appearance outside of her assisted living facility comes after a whirlwind week for the television star, who was not only hospitalized for an evaluation after receiving a welfare check, but also claimed on "The View" Friday that she wasn't incapacitated and wanted to terminate her years-long guardianship.

Williams sported a royal blue Dior monogrammed coat with furry cuffs, black leggings and a pair of black Chanel boots for dinner.

Williams has been under a court-appointed order since May 2022, and has been living in an assisted living facility for one year. She told "The View" hosts that it was her decision to get a competency test, which she passed with "flying colors."

"I needed a breath of fresh air. I needed to see the doctor, so that's why I went to the hospital," she said. "It was my choice to get an independent evaluation on my incapacitation, which I don't have it. How dare they say I have incapacitation. I do not."

Wendy Williams Says She Passed Competency Test With ‘Flying Colors' After Being Rushed To Hospital

Williams was taken to the hospital after officials responded to a 911 call from her care facility.

"On Monday, March 10, 2025, the NYPD responded to a welfare check at 505 West 35 Street," the New York Police Department said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

"EMS responded and transported a 60-year-old female to an area hospital for evaluation."

Williams had thrown a handwritten note that read "Help! Wendy!!" out the window, according to the New York Post.

One day after being rushed to the hospital, Williams spoke with Rosanna Scotto on a live segment of "Good Day New York" to discuss the outcome of her competency tests. She claimed she passed the tests with "flying colors."

"Everybody knows factually that Wendy is not incapacitated," Ginalisa Monterrosa, a caretaker for Williams, told Scotto.

During an appearance on "The Breakfast Club" that same morning, Williams further explained why she pleaded to go to a medical facility and get evaluated by an independent doctor.

"The police showed up. I'm exhausted. I wanted to go to the hospital to talk to the doctor," Williams said.

The former radio queen discussed her guardianship case on "The View," and told the women, "I need them … to get off my neck. I can't do it with these two people again."

She admitted she didn't want a guardian anymore. "It's been over three years, it's time for my money and my life to get back to status quo," Williams said. "At this point in my life, I want to terminate the guardianship and move on with my life, if that's possible at all."

In February 2024, the former talk show host's team announced she'd been diagnosed with both progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

"Over the past few years, questions have been raised at times about Wendy's ability to process information and many have speculated about Wendy's condition, particularly when she began to lose words, act erratically at times, and have difficulty understanding financial transactions," the statement said.

"In 2023, after undergoing a battery of medical tests, Williams was officially diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Aphasia, a condition affecting language and communication abilities, and frontotemporal dementia, a progressive disorder impacting behavior and cognitive functions, have already presented significant hurdles in Wendy's life."

Fox News Digital's Christina Dugan Ramirez and Emily Trainham contributed to this report.

The follow-up series to Buffy the Vampire Slayer may be here sooner than originally predicted, according to one of its key stars.

Sarah Michelle Gellar, who confirmed she will appear in a forthcoming reboot of the supernatural drama that attracted a legion of fans when it debuted in 1997, recently told People that the project is well and truly on its way.

“We've set up our offices, which means things are progressing probably faster than I'd anticipated,” Gellar, 47, told the outlet in an interview published Saturday, March 15. She did, however, add that “it's going to be a process” to ensure the return of her character, Buffy Summers, and the wider Buffy universe is perfected for a new generation of viewers.



“To do it the way it needs to be done, everyone has to be patient with all of us,” Gellar reminded fans. “This isn't something that [will just happen].”

Us Weekly confirmed in early February that producers in talks for a revival, just days before Gellar confirmed the news via Instagram. “So….. you might have heard some news this week, but I realize you haven't heard from me,” the actress wrote via the social media platform on February 7. “Three years ago, I got a call from my dear friend and mentor, Gail Berman. She told me that she wanted me to sit down with Chloé Zhao to hear her take on a potential ‘Buffy' revival.” (Zhao, 42, was the second woman in history to be awarded the Oscar for Best Director in 2021 for her work on Nomadland starring Frances McDormand.)

Gellar, who starred in Buffy until the show's finale in May 2003, continued, saying she “was blown away that Chloé even knew who I was.”

“I eventually agreed to go (mainly just to meet Chloé) and our twenty minute coffee quickly turned into a four hour adventure. We laughed, we cried, but mostly we both talked about how much this show means to us,” Gellar wrote. “I have always listened to the fans and heard your desire to revisit ‘Buffy' and her world, but it was not something I could do unless I was sure we would get it right.”

Gellar, who worked alongside Alyson Hannigan, David Boreanaz, Nicholas Brendon, Charisma Carpenter, Anthony Head and the late Michelle Trachtenberg on Buffy, admitted last month that she initially felt overwhelmed by the reboot getting the green light.

“It's heartwarming and exciting and also incredibly nerve-wracking at the same time,” the actress, who is married to Freddie Prinze Jr., told People on February 15. Her mixed feelings were revealed amid news that the Buffy reboot would feature a new lead character and Gellar would return in a recurring role, per Variety, who was one of the first outlets to report on the reboot's confirmation.

Gellar will serve as an executive producer alongside original Buffy EPs Berman, Fran Kuzui and Kaz Kuzui via Suite B. Dolly Parton is also set to be an executive producer on the pilot after her Sandollar company was part of the original project. (Hulu and 20th Television had no comment on the news.)

Original Buffy creator Joss Whedon is not involved in the refreshed series, according to Deadline.
