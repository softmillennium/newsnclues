Tensions across the countries' porous border have been brewing since Syria's new Islamist leaders ousted Bashar al-Assad, a key ally of both Hezbollah and its patron, Iran, in December. Hezbollah denied the accusations, saying in a statement it “has no connection to any events taking place within Syrian territory.” Lebanese media reported that three armed men entered Lebanon first, resulting in clashes with local tribespeople who believed they were under attack. “They are bombing randomly against civilians in al-Qasr and other border villages,” resident Mohamad Jaffar, 55, said of Syrian forces, adding that the shelling had already caused significant damage. It said that contacts between the Lebanese army command and Syrian authorities were being facilitated to restore calm.</p>

Noaa satellites provide the BoM with timely sea surface temperature (SST) observations, which are crucial for making El Niño and La Niña forecasts. Cuts affecting that SST observation network “would result in gaps not just for Australia, but also the world,” Beggs said. But were Noaa's contribution to stop, “it wouldn't take too many years” before developments in different international models rendered Mom obsolete, she said. Correspondence from a Noaa scientist, seen by Guardian Australia, suggests the GFDL is waiting for confirmation it can continue collaborating with Jakob's centre. “These predictions and the research to improve them is a really international enterprise, in which so far we've openly shared information, models, data, software, tools.</p>

The young woman from Long Plain First Nation was killed in 2022 by Jeremy Skibicki, who was given a life sentence in July 2024 after he was found guilty of first-degree murder over four murders described as “jarring and numbing” by the judge overseeing the case. The discovery came after local officials were forced into a U-turn, launching a large search operation after initially suggesting that it would be too costly to examine the refuse, much of which was buried under tonnes of clay. After meeting with former prime minister Justin Trudeau, she was blunt: “I told him these women need to be found, and they need to come home. It's a horrific situation that they're facing right now, but I'm also the premier and we have to make what are difficult decisions,” she said. Kinew said: “The effort itself is a microcosm of where we're at as a country … people from different walks of life coming together to try to do the right thing for these families.”</p>

Riibe said he was a former lifeguard and swam her into shore. Riibe's parents have accused Dominican officials of detaining him “under irregular conditions” without translators or legal counsel, saying he has been confined to a hotel room with police surveillance for more than a week.

Syrian security forces inspect vehicles at a checkpoint, following a recent wave of violence between Syrian security forces and gunmen loyal to former President Bashar Assad, as well as subsequent sectarian attacks, in Latakia, in Syria's coastal region, Tuesday, March 11, 2025. Some of the money was pledged over multiple years, making it extremely difficult to calculate an amount for 2025. More than half would be used to help people in Syria, with other funding supporting Syrians and communities elsewhere. Some factions allied with the new government launched sectarian revenge attacks — primarily targeting Assad's Alawite minority sect — that monitoring groups say killed hundreds of civilians over several days. Jobs and cash for work programs are needed so that Syrians can start to make a living.</p>

McGregor claimed they had consensual sex and is appealing against the verdict with a hearing in Dublin's high court due later this week. He has been supported by figures including the self-styled misogynist influencer Andrew Tate and anti-immigration campaigners in Ireland whose reach has been turbocharged by Elon Musk retweets.</p>

Robert Preston Morris, 63, turned himself over to officials in Osage county, where he was charged on Thursday with five counts of lewd or indecent acts with a child, Phil Bacharach, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma attorney general's office, told the Associated Press. Court records show an Osage county judge set a $50,000 bond and ordered Morris to surrender his passport. Morris is expected to make an initial appearance before a judge at 10am on 9 May, Bacharach said. Cindy Clemishire, Morris's accuser, said in a statement that she was very grateful to the authorities who have worked to make the indictment possible and was hopeful “justice will ultimately prevail”. “Now, it is time for the legal system to hold him accountable.”</p>

Nitrogen causes death by depriving the body of oxygen, essentially causing suffocation in a phenomenon known as hypoxia. Those guidelines have been adopted into Louisiana state law, which specifically outlaws gassing as a method of euthanasia in cats and dogs. Airgas, Air Products and Matheson Gas all took steps to prevent their nitrogen reaching departments of correction in death penalty states.</p>

Kallas, a former Estonian prime minister, who was born in the Soviet Union, said Radio Free Europe “has been a beacon of democracy”, alluding to it as a source of information in her younger years. She said the outlet's funding had been discussed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday. Ahead of the meeting, the Czech foreign minister, Jan Lipavský, said he wanted to discuss with counterparts “how to at least partially maintain its broadcasting”. RFE has been classed as “an undesirable organisation” in Russia since last February, effectively banning the outlet.</p>

The gay couple could be among the first Italians to be prosecuted under the law, enacted in early December, which extended an outright ban on domestic surrogacy by making it a universal crime that transcends borders, putting them on a par with terrorists, paedophiles and war criminals. Meloni's far-right Brothers of Italy had long campaigned for those who seek surrogacy abroad to be criminalised. The measure is among several socially conservative policies pursued by her government in its quest to promote so-called traditional family values. Baldini believes there could be “a few dozen” children who have been born abroad via surrogacy since the law was enforced. Baldini said a court battle in Italy would probably deter the couple.</p>

"My advice to that unnamed, low level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now, so they should be very grateful to our great country," Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.

The US district judge James E Boasberg has scheduled a hearing for Monday afternoon to demand an explanation about why his Saturday order temporarily blocking the deportation flights had apparently been ignored. “As the supreme court has repeatedly made clear – federal courts generally have no jurisdiction over the president's conduct of foreign affairs, his authorities under the Alien Enemies Act, and his core Article II powers to remove foreign alien terrorists from US soil and repel a declared invasion. On Monday morning, Boasberg scheduled a 4pm hearing for the Trump administration to explain if they defied his order. “Furthermore, courts determine whether people have broken the law – not a president acting alone, and not immigration agents picking and choosing who gets imprisoned or deported.” A federal judge had reportedly ordered the government to provide the court with 48 hours' notice before deporting Alawieh, but she was reportedly put on a flight to Paris anyway.</p>

US president says consequences of any future attacks by Yemen's Tehran-backed rebels will be ‘dire' The US president, Donald Trump, has declared he will hold Iran directly responsible for any future attacks by Yemen's Tehran-backed Houthi rebels, who have targeted US and other foreign ships in the Red Sea. Trump's comments further escalate his administration's new campaign targeting the rebels. Airstrikes killed at least 53 people this weekend and appear poised to continue. Describing the Houthis as “sinister mobsters and thugs”, Trump warned any attack by the group would be met with “great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there”.</p>

French-U.S. relations would have to drop off a cliff before Glucksmann found support from French President Emmanuel Macron's government. Macron has let his prime minister, François Bayrou, play the role of being a more critical voice. Glucksmann's party has been even more critical, posting accusations on its website that Trump is wielding power in an “authoritarian” manner and is “preparing to deliver Ukraine on a silver platter” to Russia. “My advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now,” Leavitt said, apparently referencing the U.S. fight with allied powers to free France from Nazi occupation in World War II and alongside France during World War I. Leavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-Amendment grounds.</p>

North Macedonia's government ordered a sweeping three-day inspection to be carried out at all nightclubs and cabarets across the country, starting Monday. Former economy minister Khreshnik Beteshi was being questioned at a police station in Skopje, his lawyer Elenko Milanov told reporters. Neighboring and nearby countries — Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey — along with a number of others have already accepted some 50 patients with the most serious injuries, while several countries are also sending medical teams to North Macedonia, officials said. Beti Delovska, an economist from Skopje, said North Macedonia has never experienced a tragedy like this, with dozens of young people vanishing in minutes. She noted that many young people with bright futures had already left the nation, in search of opportunities elsewhere.</p>

The biggest destination remains the US but many of Europe's Jewish communities have also received a significant demographic boost, with some that have been shrinking for decades due to an elderly population and a low birthrate now growing again. The researchers used new government statistics to establish a definitive figure for Germany's Israeli and Israeli-connected Jewish population after decades of only rough estimates. It's more about music, food and love of Israel as a second home for Jewish people than religion,” said Garmy, 31. Many of the arrivals from Israel are well educated, relatively young and have children in their new homes.

It also proposed bringing in subsidies for childcare (a financial burden cited by young adults as discouraging them from having children), unlocking earnings potential for homeowners, promoting “emerging” markets such as AI-powered products and encouraging snow and ice tourism. “By connecting consumer spending to broader social goals like elderly care improvement, childcare support and work-life balance, the plan embeds consumption growth within China's wider development objectives, signalling that consumption is being positioned not just as an economic target but as a means to enhance quality of life,” said a report in the official state media outlet, Xinhua. The plan came amid mixed domestic economic data from Beijing, as reports showed retail spending was up compared with last year, but unemployment had hit its highest level in two years and house prices had fallen in almost all medium and large cities. “The foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough,” it said. The country is facing a protracted trade war with the US, as Donald Trump flags further expanding tariffs on Chinese exports, and potentially putting pressure on other countries to place their own levies.</p>

US President Donald Trump ordered a “powerful military action” against the militants on Saturday, over what he described as an “unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism.” Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz claimed the strikes “hit multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.” Additional strikes were reported by local Houthi-affiliated media on Sunday night. The group has launched numerous strikes on international shipping they believe to be linked to Israel since late 2023, in a campaign staged in solidarity with the Palestinians. The Houthis have also repeatedly conducted long-range ballistic missile and drone strikes on Israel, as well as on Western military vessels deployed into the region.</p>

India has been highflying in chess recently, and the icing on the cake was D Gukesh's World Championship victory in Singapore last year, where he defeated Ding Liren. After his sensational Prague Masters campaign, Aravindh Chithambaram had a huge jump, climbing eight places higher to World No. They're all there together and can you imagine how fantastic that is for us because they will not only try to have the best results, but the moment one of them has a good result, all the others will be motivated to catch up. So they have this beautiful combination of friendship and rivalry,” he added. Recently, Nihal Sarin also climbed two spots higher in the rankings, and is currently World No.</p>

While the evidence for how Covid has shaped social attitudes requires careful interpretation, research data can offer some insights. And 58% would “almost never” trust any politician to tell the truth when they are in a tight corner. There has long been evidence, for example, of disillusionment and increased social atomisation, Duffy says. Conspiratorial thoughts around vaccines have proved remarkably enduring: in January 2021, as the vaccine rollout began in Britain, 75% of UK adults told YouGov it was definitely or probably false that vaccines had harmful effects that were not being disclosed. But it's not dissimilar to lots of the other infrastructures we put in around Covid [that have since been dismantled].</p>

Human intellectual abilities such as reasoning and problem-solving are diminishing, possibly due to increased exposure to visual media, the Financial Times (FT) has reported. The reported trend comes amid a rise in artificial intelligence (AI) which, by some estimates, may surpass human IQ in a matter of years. While active, intentional use of digital technologies can often be beneficial, being passively exposed to infinite content on social media coupled with frequent context-switching has been shown to negatively impact attention span, memory, and self-regulation. Human intellectual capabilities, such as critical thinking, have also been impacted by generative AI, according to recent research by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University. AI could become smarter than humans in the next three years, tech billionaire Elon Musk warned in December, shortly after his AI company, xAI, launched its first image generation model, Aurora.</p>

It would make it an offence to hold or attend events that violate Hungary's contentious “child protection” legislation, which prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to under-18s. Pride organisers have called the prime minister Viktor Orbán's drive to ban the event a restriction of fundamental freedoms of speech and assembly. The government portrays itself as a champion of traditional family values and a defender of Christian civilisation from what it calls “gender madness”, and says its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda”. Aside from banning the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality in content available to minors – including in television, films, advertisements and literature – it also prohibits the mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programmes, and forbids the public depiction of “gender deviating from sex at birth”. In a speech in February, Orbán hinted that his government would take steps to ban Budapest Pride, which attracts thousands of participants and celebrates the history of the LGBTQ+ movement while asserting the equal rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.</p>

Members and supporters of Hungary's LGBTQ community march through Budapest, amid an increasingly hostile environment for sexual minorities led by the country's right-wing government, on Saturday, July 23, 2022. The bill would make it an offense to hold or attend events that violate Hungary's contentious “child protection” legislation, which prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors under 18. The proposal is the latest step against LGBTQ+ people taken by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose government has passed legislation that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities. The government portrays itself as a champion of traditional family values and a defender of Christian civilization from what it calls “gender madness,” and argues its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda.” Aside from banning the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality in content available to minors — including in television, films, advertisements and literature — it also prohibits the mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programs, and forbids the public depiction of “gender deviating from sex at birth.”</p>

Ofcom also announced on Monday that it would ask online storage and filesharing services to outline what measures they have in place to prevent paedophiles from distributing child sexual abuse material via their platforms. Any company that does not respond, or appears to have inadequate measures in place, faces an investigation.

In an interview with French media published on Saturday, Macron argued that the bloc's rearmament efforts would be more effective if member states stopped “buying American” and instead turned to the EU's military industrial complex. “Faced with unpredictable powers, we simply need to be less dependent on them. Macron said he plans to discuss his proposals with incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the coming days. SIPRI researcher Pieter Wezeman noted that while Europe has taken steps to boost its defense industry, reliance on American arms remains deeply rooted.</p>

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Monday that Odey had shown “reckless disregard” for the governance of his hedge fund and his conduct proved he was “not a fit and proper person to perform any function related to regulated activities”. The FCA said Odey later tried to obstruct OAM's leadership from taking any action. During that time, it said Odey had used his majority shareholding in OAM to get rid of the existing members of its executive committee, weeks before he was due to appear for a disciplinary hearing over sexual harassment allegations in January 2022.

The commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, conceded last week that a recession was possible, but suggested this would be “worth it”. As shown in recent polling, how a person views the economy under Trump depends on their political party. It's a sudden flip from how Republicans and Democrats viewed the economy last year while Joe Biden was president. Trump's insistence on tariffs comes in defiance of growing concerns that the policies could ultimately lead to a recession. “But there's growing concern that tariffs could have a lasting and unknowable impact on the economy, regardless of whether they're walked back soon or not.”</p>

Rwandan President Paul Kagame has highlighted Belgium's role in dividing the region during colonial rule, which led to families being separated across borders. Speaking at the Presidential Citizen Outreach event at BK Arena in Kigali on Sunday, he said, “one of the misfortunes we have is having been colonized by a small country, similar in size to Rwanda, which partitioned Rwanda to match its own size.” The president claimed that Western nations are enforcing sanctions on Kigali under Belgium's influence. When resources are limited, we rely on relentless will and courage to defend ourselves,” Kagame said. He called on the people of Rwanda to be resilient in the face of external challenges, reinforce national unity, and uphold peaceful relations with other nations grounded in mutual respect.</p>

SpaceX has called reports about its FAA dealings “false”, adding: “Starlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system. There is no effort or intent for Starlink to ‘take over' any existing contract – that's just FUD”, meaning “fear, uncertainty, and doubt”.

Palestinian experts working with British archaeologists estimate that more than two-thirds of heritage, cultural and archaeological sites in Gaza have been damaged, often very badly. Close to Pasha Palace is Hamam al-Samara, a 700-year-old bath house that was among the most important of Gaza's monuments. A recent report by Palestinian conservation experts in the occupied West Bank and UK-based archaeologists estimated that just protecting historical sites from further damage in Gaza – if the current ceasefire holds – will cost about $33m and take up to 18 months. Others look to cities such as Dubai for inspiration, with a focus on towering hotels and malls, not heritage. It was expanded over the centuries and rebuilt once after being almost destroyed by British artillery targeting an Ottoman ammunition dump there.</p>

Some Labour MPs want to borrow more instead of cutting benefits - but others argue this would spook the financial markets, writes our correspondent Henry Zeffman Since coming to power Keir Starmer has made some controversial decisions - reducing winter fuel allowance, hiking national insurance for employers and slashing the foreign aid budget. Liberal Democrat MP Liz Jarvis asks Labour's Stephen Timms if he can assure those who are unable to work that they won't see their benefits cut. Shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately asks Kendall why 100,000 more young people are "not in education, employment or training, since the Labour government came into power".

The organisers of a marathon in southern Taiwan issued an apology on Sunday after winners were mistakenly awarded Type 95 automatic rifles-firearms used by China's People's Liberation Army- as prizes, per Taipei Times. The Fongshan Marathon, organized by Hsu's office, took place in Kaohsiung's Fongshan District, with routes passing through three normally restricted military schools: the Military Academy, the Fongshan Army Infantry School, and the Chung Cheng Armed Forces Preparatory School. "Due to the co-organizer's oversight, the trophies were mistakenly modelled after rifles not used by Taiwan's armed forces," he said, adding that steps have been taken to retrieve and replace them as soon as possible. The event's co-organizer, the Kaohsiung City Fongshan Jogging Association, clarified that the rifle-shaped design was chosen purely for its aesthetics and relevance to the military, dismissing any suggestion that it was linked to "united front" efforts. The manufacturer has been instructed to produce new trophies, and event staff will reach out to winners once the replacements are ready.</p>

Civilians are continuing to be evacuated from the outskirts of Sudzha, a district in Russia's western Kursk region that was recently retaken by Moscow's armed forces. As we've been reporting, Ukrainian authorities have said Russian forces are continuing with their efforts to cross the border and invade Ukraine's northern Sumy region. We've recently been hearing from French President Emmanuel Macron, who says it's time to move toward a concrete peace plan "with all our partners". Former Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Alina Frolova, says she does not expect "so much success" during tomorrow's talks between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. "I don't think America can prevail absolutely in these negotiations," Frolova says, adding that the US understands it needs "Ukraine and Europe on board".</p>

Thinktank says unauthorised absence is ‘a leading cause' of performance gap between disadvantaged pupils and peers “Without a broader system of support, it is extremely difficult for schools to drive meaningful change in attendance rates.” Di'Iasio said that “for some families, school seems to have become – at least in part – optional”, and said fines for taking unauthorised termtime holidays were failing to halt that trend. “Far from solving the problem, fines often deepen tensions between schools and parents. Getting more pupils attending school regularly is a top priority for the government.”</p>

National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Sunday held bilateral talks with US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and chaired a conclave of top global intelligence czars focusing on boosting cooperation in confronting various security challenges including terrorism and threats posed by emerging technologies. The deliberations were held behind closed doors and there was no official word on them. In retaliation, New Delhi also expelled Canadian Charge d'Affaires Stewart Wheeler and five other diplomats.

President Donald Trump on Saturday vowed to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks, and warned that Tehran would be held “fully accountable” for their actions. Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, on Sunday told ABC that the strikes “actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.” He didn't identify them or give evidence. If it continues its aggression, we will move to additional escalation options.” The Houthis have targeted U.S. warships and shot down American drones flying over Yemen. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide updated information on operations, said that beginning at about midnight local time in Yemen, the Houthis fired 11 drones and at least one missile over about 12 hours.</p>

The United States has escalated its strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis, with President Donald Trump vowing on Saturday to use ‘overwhelming lethal force' against the rebels who have attacked international ships in the Red Sea in ‘solidarity' with Gaza.

Multiple US strikes in Yemen's capital Sanaa and other areas have resulted in numerous casualties with the militants also vowing escalation as they face one of the most extensive attacks since the war in Gaza began in October 2023. Here is the conflict in 10 points.

The information, which has resurfaced now, was reported by Business Insider in November 2021. Dubbed the ‘Mount Trumpmore' sculpture, it adds Trump's likeness to those of former presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt. The bronze was also seen in another photo of a Taekwondo master presenting Trump with an honorary certificate. It was presented to Trump by Noem on July 3, 2020, before he spoke at Mount Rushmore as part of a political rally and fireworks display.</p>

US District Judge James E Boasberg was hearing a suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, which preemptively sued Donald Trump late Friday, saying five Venezuelan men being held at an immigration detention centre in Texas were at “imminent risk of removal” under the Alien Enemies Act. The act, which has been invoked only three times in US history, deports people suspected to be illegal immigrants without an opportunity to be heard before an immigration or federal court judge. On Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt asserted that the administration was not flouting court orders. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele reacted to Boasberg's ruling in a post on social media platform X. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who negotiated the deal with El Salvador, wrote on X, “We sent over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua, which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars.”</p>

Speaking to French media ahead of an online summit that the U.K. hosted on Saturday, Macron said the French-British blueprint doesn't aim to deploy a “mass” of soldiers in Ukraine and instead envisages stationing troop contingents in key locations. Their missions could include providing training and supporting Ukrainian defenses, to demonstrate long-term support for Kyiv, the reports quoted Macron as saying. Le Parisien cited Macron as saying that Moscow's agreement wasn't needed for such deployment. Many more countries were involved this time than the previous meeting on March 2.</p>

Citing the long battle over a covering for HS2 through ancient woodland, dubbed the bat tunnel, Reeves said wrangling between environmental regulators, councils and government departments needed to stop or time and cost overruns would persist. One proposal will be to make it easier for private sector contractors to obtain environmental permits, with just one agency in charge of the system, and permits being scrapped for low-risk or temporary projects. Reeves said: “Today we are taking further action to free businesses from the shackles of regulation.

The wartime law previously had only been invoked three times, including against Japanese Americans during World War II. Reuters reported that the administration still carried out removal flights containing more than 200 suspected members of Tren de Aragua. Your trusted source for breaking down the latest news from Washington and beyond, delivered weekdays. But Trump taking this controversial next step – even with a stated goal of protecting Americans – is no surprise, having directly teased his intentions on Inauguration Day. Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas added in a social media post that invoking the wartime law “takes us down a dangerous road.” And long before Trump moved forward with his plan, other politicians denounced even the possibility.</p>

'Outnumbered' co-host Kayleigh McEnany discusses President Donald Trump's high polling numbers as Democrats see favorability drop. U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg made headlines Saturday for granting an emergency restraining order blocking the Trump administration from invoking a 1798 law to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the violent gang Tren de Aragua, for 14 days. His decision drew immediate criticism from Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, who declared in an interview on "Fox & Friends" that, "We are not stopping." Salvadorean President Nayib Bukele posted footage showing hundreds of alleged criminal migrants arriving in Central America. Until recently, Boasberg has largely avoided making headlines, including any public broadsides that may have put him at odds with the Trump administration.</p>

The County Kerry town of Dingle boasted one of Ireland's “earliest” St Patrick's Day parades, which kicked off at 6 am local time on Monday, March 17.

Footage from politician Michael Healy-Rae shows Dingle's fife and drum band marching through the town before the sun had risen on Monday morning.

According to national news reports, the tradition stems from restrictions banning gatherings between sunrise and sunset imposed by British authorities in the 1870s.

The parade route included a stop at St Mary's Church for mass, finishing at 7:30 am. Credit: Michael Healy-Rae via Storyful</p>

Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account. "But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years." Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.

Tesla stock (TSLA) fell nearly 5% Monday, continuing a rough few weeks — and start to 2025 — for the automaker. During Tesla's Q1 earnings call, when asked about the FSD rollout in China, CEO Elon Musk said difficulties remain. Tesla's FSD is also considered less advanced than rival software seen in Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Xpeng, and others. Official confirmation of Tesla's global sales will come in early April when the company reports first quarter deliveries.

The president's louder message about tariffs when compared with taxes was also touched on by Evercore ISI's Sarah Bianchi in a recent research note. The contrast between Bessent's interview this weekend and earlier moments like his confirmation hearing is stark. During that hearing, Bessent called tax cuts the most important issue before him and described getting them done as "pass-fail."

The proposal came in a joint court filing on Friday from Musk, Altman, OpenAI, and other named defendants, including Microsoft (MSFT). A judge has ultimate discretion over whether to grant the joint request, though the California federal district court judge overseeing this case, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, is likely to agree on a date that both sides want. The defendants have called Musk's allegations "false" and claimed he has no legal basis for blocking OpenAI's for-profit conversion. Musk named LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Microsoft executive Dee Templeton as defendants, claiming they illegally served as directors of both OpenAI and Microsoft at a time when the two companies were competing in the AI market. While Gonzales Rogers said some of Musk's claims would be fast-tracked for trial, she denied his request for an injunction that would have temporarily blocked the defendants from carrying out plans to turn the artificial intelligence charity into a for-profit business — and from transferring any material assets owned by OpenAI or its subsidiaries, including intellectual property.</p>

Netflix stock has struggled in recent sessions as a broader market sell-off continues to slam high-flying tech names. As a reminder, the company will no longer reveal subscriber data beginning in its 2025 reporting cycle. Management said it decided to raise prices, as its content "has never been better," with more movies and TV shows expected throughout 2025. In 2024, Netflix posted a record-breaking year, which included revenue growth of 16% as operating margins surged 600 basis points to nearly 27% — that's about 300 basis points higher than its guidance at the outset of the year.

The firm reduced its December 2025 forecast for Brent crude oil by $5 (BZ=F) to $71 per barrel. Meanwhile, some economists have cut their growth forecasts amid a string of disappointing data and uncertainty over Trump's tariff policies. Struyven and his team expect oil demand will grow less than expected, "incorporating slower US GDP growth on higher tariffs." Earlier this month, futures fell after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) surprised Wall Street by announcing it would bump up production in April as a first step toward unwinding its production cuts.

An estimated 11,400 Baby Boomers will reach 65 each day in 2025, representing about one-fifth of the population. “Teaching the next generation about this is part of family legacy,” Pennington said. Noting that her firm sometimes serves clients made up of four or even five generations, she added, “Helping them move through this process as a family is a very rewarding thing for us to be able to do.” When gathering together to talk about wealth transfers, Pennington advised touching on topics with heirs such as their values and experiences, how they develop their relationship with money, and the kinds of things they want to invest in.</p>

"We still think earnings growth is going to be good," Yardeni Research chief markets strategist Eric Wallerstein told Yahoo Finance. To Wallerstein's point, while views on the economic outlook have soured, most economists and equity strategists aren't actually calling for a recession. BlackRock's chief investment and portfolio strategist for the Americas Gargi Chaudhuri told Yahoo Finance her team remains "overweight US equities." He added that this makes him "very comfortable" with his 6,700 year-end target for the S&P 500.

One big four rival told The Sunday Times that in recent weeks, 10 EY partners had contacted them seeking work. EY currently has 894 equity partners and 757 non-equity partners, which jointly own and manage the firm, though the latter group do not share in its profits. “We continually assess the needs of our business and make adjustments when required,” a spokesperson for EY told City AM. EY employs some 20,000 people in the UK and has struggled with a slowdown in consultancy spending, both from private businesses and imminent plans from the government to slash spending on outside consultants. In 2024, the UK Big Four firms made over 900 redundancies, as clients struggling with tighter monetary conditions reduce spending on costly external advisers.</p>

Among all UK workers, 10 per cent are currently actively considering leaving work for an extended period, with a further 20 per cent having considered leaving in the last year, data from PwC revealed. As well as the cost to individuals, businesses are understandably concerned about the direct impact on productivity and financial performance,” said Marco Amitrano, senior partner of PwC UK. Despite mass fears around inactivity, employers were reluctant to fix the problem themselves, with 57 per cent revealing they would be worried to recruit someone who had been inactive. Despite stating they were considering more support, the survey found a clear mismatch on what employers were planning to offer, as they highlighted benefits such as company car schemes rather than culture or health support. “If we are serious about reducing economic inactivity and contributing to the government's ambition of economic growth, then we need joined-up action not only helping people back into work, but more importantly stemming the flow of people out of the work,” added Katie Johnston, local and devolved government leader at PwC.</p>

According to the National Weather Service (NWS), two EF4-strength tornadoes — indicative of "devastating" damage — ripped through Arkansas on Friday. Wind-driven wildfires have also caused extensive damage across Texas and Oklahoma, with the latter reporting more than 130 fires, according to state Governor Kevin Stitt. "As water temperatures continue to increase in the Gulf, warmer air with more moisture can be forced northward into the Southern states ahead of a cold front, providing an extra boost of energy for severe thunderstorms that can produce tornadoes."

After spending more than nine months in space, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finally coming home. NASA is targeting a Tuesday evening (March 18) splashdown for the returning astronauts, if weather conditions remain favorable. Wilmore and Williams arrived at the ISS in June as part of Boeing's first Starliner Crew Test Flight. But a number of issues with Boeing's spacecraft — including five helium leaks and five failures of its reaction control system (RCS) thrusters — led to the mission being abandoned and the duo's time in space extended from eight days to nearly 300. To mitigate them, the astronauts have been doing two hours of resistance and endurance training every day.</p>

Just like the mountains, lakes on Earth can be ancient, or more than 1 million years old. "As a result, that site never fills in," Edlund said, which is why rift lakes can last so long. "Evolution has had so much time to work in that system without being interrupted," he said. These organisms pull dissolved silica from the water and turn it into biologically produced glass, which encases them. "When we look at the diatoms in Lake Baikal, they just blow your mind," Edlund said.</p>

Perhaps more than any player since Kobe Bryant, his style of play has been a lightning rod for controversy. Meanwhile, some incredibly talented writers and analysts have inferred that he is harmful to his own team's chances. He hasn't played 10 or more playoff games since 2016, when Kevin Durant was his teammate on the Oklahoma City Thunder. He's only attempted 18 shots or more thrice as a Nugget, shooting 49.1% from the field in both contests. It doesn't go very well, as his effective field-goal percentage evaporates from 58.5% with Jokic to 43.0% without, falling by a larger margin than that of any other Nuggets' rotation player.</p>

The Show 25 takes all the elements fans have loved in recent years, removed pain points, and left us with a complete package that sports fans wish they had when it comes to NFL, NBA, or NHL games. One of the big new batting features in MLB The Show 25 is a “ambush batting,” which is a wholly bizarre name I have to assume they settled on because nothing else really fit. I lead my team with a .324 batting average, 143 hits, 54 RBIs, and an OPS of .857. This is compounded by a lack of off-field interactions with teammates or management, which has led to the mode feeling rather monotonous. Perhaps the greatest compliment is that I keep wanting to play in spite of this.</p>

But after he had a rather pedestrian 25.6% strikeout rate last season in the minors, I want him to be blowing people away this spring. Weathers got bumped up draft boards last spring thanks to a velo bump, and we're seeing the same thing play out this time around. That didn't happen much last year, as he made just seven starts coming off Tommy John surgery before a hamstring injury more or less wrecked his season. The stuff looks terrific – and his new changeup could be a nice bonus – but mostly, this one was just about Ray being ranked too low. I've never had much interest in drafting Bednar, and that was before manager Derek Shelton refused to name him the closer Sunday.</p>

The Cincinnati Bengals are one of only two teams in the NFL that don't have a general manager, but it seems like they might have one now: Joe Burrow. As for Higgins, he landed a four-year, $115 million deal that makes him highest paid No. Fair or not, the Bengals have a reputation around the NFL for being cheap and that was fully on display last year when both Higgins and Chase were each trying to negotiate a new deal. Two months later, the star QB showed up to Super Bowl week in New Orleans and while he was there, he sent a very clear message to the Bengals' front office: Get my guys under contract. When you're paying your starting quarterback and his two favorite receivers an average of $124 million per year, that means you have to save money in other spots on the roster and you do that by drafting smart and finding low-cost free agents who can have an instant impact.</p>

In fact, more than $7 million remained unclaimed as Rory McIlroy and J.J. Spaun battled for first and second place in a three-hole aggregate playoff on Monday. McIlroy ultimately came through with his second Players Championship title, birding the first hole and never looking back during a chilly and windy affair at TPC Sawgrass. In order to grab that massive check, McIlroy beat Spaun by two strokes across holes No. In doing so, he claimed the $4.5 million prize, nearly double what Spaun will bring home for his second-place finish.

The Cincinnati Bengals may be able to have their cake and eat it, too. Less than 24 hours after word came down the franchise  is inking historic extensions with receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, it now appears Cincinnati may also be keeping another familiar face in town. If the Bengals do end up finding a way to keep Hendrickson aboard, it would be an almost unfathomable development. Similar to Chase and Higgins, however, it'll likely cost a pretty penny. Hendrickson, 30, is coming off a tremendous season where he led the NFL with 17.5 sacks.</p>

That distinction was held shortly by Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett, who recently signed a four-year, $160 million extension. Teammates since 2021, Chase and Higgins have become arguably the NFL's top receiving duo over that span. Along with Chase and Higgins, the Bengals also recently granted one of Burrow's other wishes by re-signing tight end Mike Gesicki to a three-year, $25.5 million deal. The NFL's leader with 17.5 sacks last season, Hendrickson wants to remain in Cincinnati, but he is also looking for a significant pay raise. It'll be interesting to see if the Bengals can work similar magic with Hendrickson as they did for Chase and Higgins.</p>

Since Crosby signed an extension earlier this month that put him at a $35.5 million average annual salary, two players have since surpassed that mark over the next two weeks. With Chase joining Garrett in the $40 million non-quarterback club, Chase's deal will certainly impact other non-quarterbacks whose agents are popping bottles while negotiating extensions for their superstar clients. Wide receivers still dominate the highest-paid non-quarterbacks list based on average per year salary, as eight of them are in the top-12 with Hill, Metcalf and Aiyuk tied for 10th. He broke Jefferson's mark set last offseason, but remains in third among non-quarterbacks behind Garrett and Bosa. These two charts hammer home why Garrett's deal set sthe barometer for Watt, Parsons, Hendrickson, and other pass rushers seeking extensions.</p>

Some speculation has been making the rounds that North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham, who also serves as selection committee chair, had a role in making sure his team received a bid. Decisions like this invite such speculation, but the committee has very strict rules about members not being allowed to discuss or vote on their own team or teams in their conference. That rule is strictly enforced, so it's highly unlikely Cunningham swayed any decision-making in this case. That is especially true of the predictive metrics, which primarily try to predict scoring margins. Also, there are teams in the bracket seeded nowhere near their predicative metric rankings.</p>

Since 2011, a total of 13 teams seeded seventh or worse have crashed the season's final weekend, including 11th-seeded NC State last year. Sure, that was under John Calipari, but new head coach Mark Pope has won a grand total of zero games in the Big Dance and has twice been beaten in the first round as a top six seed. That's fairly remarkable considering we're talking about just two 11 or 12 seeds every single year having the opportunity to make this happen. That has the potential to be a bit longer than those interested schools would like. That didn't happen, and now the Zags are set to face Georgia in an 8/9 contest on Thursday.</p>

Dallas Mavericks fans are still in mourning (well, sports mourning, anyway) over the already infamous trade that sent franchise cornerstone Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers for a package centered around Anthony Davis. Things went downhill for Dallas immediately after the deal, as Davis was injured in his first game and has yet to return, while star guard Kyrie Irving was lost for the season due to a torn ACL in early March. As a result, the Mavericks have absolutely cratered, going 1-6 since Irving's injury and falling from No. "We get paid a lot of money just to play basketball, so for us, we have little things like that that may be distracting and what not -- it shouldn't affect us. Christie's sentiment is one you generally hear from players, saying that fan behavior shouldn't have any bearing on their performance.</p>

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) posted a Tiktok video on Feb. 20 saying he had "breaking news" about the fate of Medicare coverage for telehealth visits, which allow patients to see health care providers remotely from their homes. "President Trump and Elon Musk blew up the continuing resolution last December that would have extended these telehealth authorities by two years," Khanna told us via email. Permanently extending telehealth for medical care under Medicare could cost taxpayers about $25 billion over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. Congress made Medicare coverage of behavioral health services delivered remotelypermanent in December 2020, but left other telehealth benefits hanging on by a string. "Now, once again, we've got another deadline where, if Congress doesn't act, our flexibilities go away," said Kyle Zebley, senior vice president of public policy for the American Telemedicine Association.</p>

The newly built maximum-security facility, which can hold up to 40,000 people, has been accused by human rights groups of mistreating inmates.

Increasing research highlights postbiotics' beneficial mechanisms, primarily their ability to modulate protective actions against pathogens, fortify epithelial barriers, and regulate immune responses. As scientific understanding deepens, postbiotics stand poised to complement probiotics significantly, marking a transformative shift towards comprehensive, preventive healthcare strategies and innovative therapeutic applications.1 For example, poultry-fed diets enriched with postbiotics demonstrate increased body weight gain, improved feed conversion rates, and healthier gut morphology compared to control groups.2,3 They promote the growth of beneficial gut microbiota, directly compete with pathogenic bacteria for adhesion sites, and enhance mucosal defense mechanisms through antimicrobial peptides. They offer benefits like modulating immune responses, enhancing gut barrier integrity, and exerting anti-inflammatory effects without the risks associated with administering live microorganisms, especially in immunocompromised individuals.5</p>

At this point, Rick's face isn't just a meme—it's a mood, perfectly summing up everything The White Lotus fans are feeling after the latest episode: confused, horrified, and oddly supportive.</p>
