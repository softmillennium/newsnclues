Patrick Schwarzenegger left little to the imagination while posing with his fiancée Abby Champion in a sexy new Skims campaign. Schwarzenegger, 31, and Champion, 28, were tapped by Kim Kardashian on Wednesday, March 17, to pose in a wedding shop-inspired photoshoot. She fed him while slaying in a black corset, lace thong and sheer stockings. “💍❤️FOREVER AND EVER ❤️💍,” the duo captioned their joint Instagram announcement on Tuesday, December 26. Schwarzenegger gushed about posing in the campaign with Champion, sharing in a PR statement, “Being part of SKIMS’ Wedding Shop with my fiancée Abby was such a fun experience and made me more excited for our big day.” He continued, “Grooms are usually expected to just show up, but Skims designed with the men in mind also.” Champion agreed that Skims was the right choice to include in their wedding celebration. “Skims is all about making special moments even more meaningful, and with the variety of styles we offer, every couple and bridal party can find something that feels completely authentic to them.” Related: Patrick Schwarzenegger, Fiancee Abby 'Haven't Even Started' Wedding Planning According to Patrick Schwarzenegger, he and fiancée Abby Champion won’t be walking down the aisle anytime soon. “We haven’t even started [wedding planning]!” Schwarzenegger, 30, exclusively told Us Weekly at Emporio Armani’s spring 2024 collection launch party at Socialist in New York City on Wednesday, April 24.

Sophia Bush and Bethany Joy Lenz are not fans of how Chad Michael Murray and Hilarie Burton Morgan’s One Tree Hill characters disappeared from the series following their exit. “Katie says, ‘I wish we could have seen Haley reading a letter from Lucas just to hear what was going on in their lives. What would y’all imagine Lucas, Peyton and Sawyer are up to?’” Lenz, 43, read aloud during the fan question segment of her and Bush’s “Drama Queens” podcast. “I don’t even remember where they moved,” Lenz said. Related: Hilarie Burton Morgan Wasn't Asked Back for 'One Tree Hill' Season 7 Hilarie Burton Morgan is recalling how she and One Tree Hill costar Chad Michael Murray found out they weren’t returning for season 7 of the long-running series – and fans are surprised by her candid admission. During the Sunday, May 19, episode of her “Drama Queens” podcast, Burton Morgan, 41, told cohosts and former costars […] In season 6, they got married and welcomed a daughter named Sawyer. While Bush was unsure of the exact storyline, she believed that it might have had something to do with their characters going across the country. “This is the problem, they didn’t give us enough to make [sense] of where our friends went.” Lenz echoed similar sentiments stating she had “no idea” what happened. Bush brought up that texting was coming into play at the time, so it would have been easy to keep Murray and Burton Morgan’s characters in the show’s universe. “I know we brought this up with the powers that be at the time, but I feel like it was more of personal beef than anything that made sense for our characters, which is unfortunate,” she claimed. Like why am I not getting photo updates of this baby?’ It feels really weird.” Lenz agreed it was strange for the show to not bring up Lucas or Peyton again especially when One Tree Hill’s “world was built around” their relationship. Murray, Burton Morgan, Bush and Lenz all starred on One Tree Hill when it premiered in 2003. Burton Morgan, for her part, left to pursue other opportunities. In May 2024, Burton Morgan revealed that neither herself nor Murray were offered season 7 contracts. Following Murray and Burton Morgan’s exits, One Tree Hill continued for an additional three seasons.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The late Gene Hackman only named late wife Betsy Arakawa in his will, which has raised some major questions about his three kids. “We have no reason to believe that they were disinherited from the trust,” attorney Allison E. Zinn, who specializes in trust and estate litigation, told Us Weekly exclusively. Us confirmed last week that Hackman’s will, which hadn’t been updated since June 2005, left his entire estate to late wife and successor trustee Arakawa. Some reports have speculated that because Hackman’s three children — Christopher, 65, Elizabeth, 62, and Leslie, 58 — were not listed as beneficiaries (they are noted as next of kin), they will not inherit any of his fortune. Related: Gene Hackman's Estate Asks to Block Release of Investigation Records The estate of actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, is seeking to keep sensitive images from the investigation into their deaths out of the public eye. Multiple outlets reported that a legal petition was filed at the First Judicial Court in Santa Fe County on Tuesday, March 11, to prevent the Santa Fe […] “It’s possible that [Arakawa] would’ve been a beneficiary when he died and then when she passed away, his children could be the heirs,” Zinn continued. Zinn explained that she doesn’t see “any issues” at the moment with Hackman’s will. She noted that since they are listed as next of kin, they will be notified of all court proceedings related to Hackman’s estate. Us confirmed on February 27 that Hackman, 95, and Arakawa, 64, were found dead at their Santa Fe home. Their causes of death have since been revealed with authorities confirming that Arakawa died first from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

Singer-songwriter Paul Cauthen confirmed he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer after abruptly canceling his tour. “I have had a lot of time to reflect and realize that life is short and precious,” Cauthen, 39, said in an emotional statement shared via Instagram on Friday, March 14. The country music star’s representatives originally announced on February 6 that Cauthen was “leaving the road” immediately in order to prioritize his “mental and physical health.” Cauthen remained silent on social media for over a month before releasing a video detailing his recent health problems. Just know that it’s been for the right reasons,” he insisted. “[I’ll] go through some rehab time and be right back in the saddle,” Platt, 64, promised via Facebook on Sunday, February 16. A few weeks after getting off the road, Cauthen had “a bunch of scans done” at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, where he was initially told most of his tests came back “clear.” Doctors found “one little hot spot” that needed further examination, but upon review, they discovered a mass in his thyroid. “Last fall I was diagnosed with stomach cancer,” the “Red Solo Cup” crooner wrote via Instagram in June 2022, noting his intentions to take a performance hiatus. Just know that I thank you so much for unwavering support through it all.” Paul’s wife, Elizabeth Cauthen, shared a photo of the couple kissing via Instagram on Friday, March 14 in the wake of his public diagnosis confirmation, along with an empowering message: “There ain’t nothing we can’t beat as long as we’ve got each other.” The “Cocaine Country Dancing” musician was only five shows into his Black On Black Tour when his spokesperson confirmed he was stepping away from the stage in February. “We all love Paul very much and we are very happy and relieved that he has made this decision to put himself first,” his representatives said at the time.

They are under attack by fascist Mark Ruffalo, who has come to colonize their planet. The early design of the Creepers evolved considerably between Bong and creature artist Hee Chul Jang (“Okja” and “Snowpiercer”). But when thinking about 3D animation, the flatness didn’t translate well and looked bad. Dan Glass, who served as production VFX supervisor (“Okja”), helped achieve a workable model for animation with early tests that made them bigger and bulkier. “There’s a certain amount of Bong’s storytelling which leaves the origins to mystery, but they’re essentially vegetarian, peace-loving animals,” Glass told IndieWire. “We did tests as a centipede, we did tests that were quadrupeds, which was adopted for the juniors because when they’re doing their big circle around the ship, the actual leg motion is more like a quadruped,” Glass said. It became important for them to move quickly. What Glass enjoyed most was making the Creepers appear scary and threatening at first, but then revealing how kind and adorable they really are. Bong, who meticulously storyboards everything, encouraged individual bits of business that were hand-animated (Framestore handled the interior scenes while DNEG oversaw environments and crowd animation). “In South Korea, people love to watch movies over and over again,” added Glass, “so Bong is very keen to put things in that you see only on the second or third time.” Bong’s dry wit is on display when the Creepers encounter the wounded Mickey 17 stranded in their ice cave and drag him out rather than eat him. “As one of the juniors jumps onto the mama and rolls off, he kind of tumbles and comes up to look at him,” Glass said. “They regularly bump into others and go flying, so that’s another thing if you watch and re-watch, you’ll see these little clumsy incidents happening a lot of the time.” However, when they’re up on the crevasse and the mama slips and falls, Glass discussed with Bong if they were being too playful. “Because isn’t that meant to be when they’re sort of horrifying?” he said. But Bong liked that there was an edge of playfulness already.” This was much better for matching cinematographer Darius Khondji’s lighting. They also used space hoppers and yoga balls for the smaller Creepers. “They’re basically the right height and space hoppers have ears you can hold, so that’d be easy. I thought they’d be good because you can cart them around, and just pop them where you need to. But, as Robert was between these things, he got all these yoga balls rolling across, and he had to literally weave between them.” “We obviously built a number of model variations, just in size, and then some texture on top of that,” said Glass. “But when you’ve got a crowd of that size, texture, and geometry variation quickly just merges,” he continued. “All too often with those kinds of large crowds, you can see the run cycles, and they’re just on repeat. Every shot, even in the crowd, has a bunch of individual animations. As they’re talking about their mama, there’ll be one that sort of stops and puts their head up, looks around, and then drops down.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

So, you know, I kind of gave him a, ‘No Moose.’” “At this point again, there’s so much chaos going on with the alarm going off, I give him like a very stern like, ‘Moose. “He comes back through the door and attacks me for a second time, and not trying to be dramatic, but I honestly just felt like I am fighting for my life here against a dog,” he said.

I’m not going to share that, but you hear me saying, ‘This is serious. Now at the ER, Lowe received stitches in “five or six different places” on his arm.

Take a seat in theaters, that is. That’s a lot to keep — pardon — straight. The “comedy of errors” plot is twisty and complicated, with six major characters to introduce, but it can’t seem too twisty or else the audience won’t get that this is a light comedy. Luckily, there’s some handy title cards, like “Lee wants a baby with Angela” and “Min wants to stay with Chris,” along with a few choice lines, such as “I don’t even want to be an American! The movie revolves around Min (Han Gi-Chan), a gay Korean man who wants to live in America with his boyfriend, Chris (Bowen Yang), but needs a green card. His Korean grandmother (Youn Yuh-Jung, fresh off an Oscar for Minari) can’t know he’s gay, so he proposes to his friend Lee (Kelly Marie Tran), who wants to have a baby with her girlfriend, Angela (Lily Gladstone). Min’s grandmother visits and hilarity ensues. Also in the cast is Joan Chen (Dídi), who plays Lee’s overly supportive mother to confirmed scene-stealing effect. Directed by Ang Lee, the film’s various comedic machinations surrounding marriage play a little differently in an era when gay marriage was not legal. The original movie is incredibly beloved — it received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, and in 2023 it was selected by the Library of Congress to join the National Film Registry. “Even though we can foretell just about everything that will happen in The Wedding Banquet — every plot twist, every screwball complication — we don’t much mind, because the comedy is so brisk and good-natured,” Vulture film critic Bilge Ebiri wrote of the movie. He also added that its sincere moments are “sturdy and heartfelt.” The Wedding Banquet will be released in theaters on April 18 — the perfect time to start pre-pre-gaming Pride Month.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Kristin Davis recalled a moment from Sex and the City when Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) tries on the now-iconic “naked dress” for her group of friends before heading out for her first official date with Mr. Big (Chris Noth). During a recent episode of her “Are You a Charlotte?” podcast, Davis, 59, recounted the scene during a discussion with Christine Taylor, who pointed out that Davis’ character, Charlotte, was the one who actually gave the slip its now-famous moniker. “[You] nam[ed] it the naked dress,” Taylor, 53, said, to which Davis replied, “I know! Lest you forget, episode 6 of season 1 opens with Carrie dressed in a beige slip mini — an itty-bitty dress by DKNY with transparent spaghetti straps and a dangerously low back. The sex columnist is posing for a photo shoot for her new ad, which will later be plastered on the side of an M11 bus. Weeks later, Carrie wears the dress again, this time to her first-ever date with Mr. Big.

Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda (also known as Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon) took a break from filming their HBO spinoff series to hit the red carpet — and, fittingly, looked the part of their fabulous onscreen counterparts. In the podcast, Davis gave props to a line delivered by Samantha: “Then Samantha says, and [this is] very, very smart, ‘You can still get dumped on your first date or your 10th date whenever you have sex,’” she recalled. Though Carrie throws a fur coat on top of it, Mr. Big simply calls it an “interesting dress” when he sees her — and, spoiler alert, the two ultimately end up in bed together.

According to spokespeople, the show will very much go on next year, albeit with some differences that may take a moment for longtime festivalgoers to wrap their heads around. The first distinction from this and other past years is that the second weekend of SXSW, which has been devoted exclusively to its music offerings, has been dropped. But reports that this means an end to SXSW Music are not correct. And in fact, they maintain, there is a way of looking at it as being as much of an expansion as a contraction, because there will now be music showcases spread across seven nights instead of six. With the Austin Convention Center closing down for three years, we believe it’s a great opportunity to put new ideas into action,” the statement said. In conclusion, the SXSW statement said, “We also know that post-pandemic attendees want more personalized experiences, and we’re excited to explore new ways to bring people together.” Confusion began to spread Sunday after SXSW released its dates for 2026 and the traditional all-music second weekend of the festival was notably missing. Nevertheless, the festival site also showed that music-only passes for next year had already gone on sale… at a much lower cost than the asking price for film/TV-only passes. Attendance for SXSW’s music offerings has declined over the years from its 2000s-era peak, although many bands and indie labels still consider it a vital stop. Only 2026 will tell whether the experience becomes even “more curated,” as the statement puts it, even with performances being spread over seven nights instead of six.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Editor’s note: As Emmys season rolls along, IndieWire will update this page with in-depth Emmy predictions from Awards Editor Marcus Jones. A link to each category will lead to lists of the ever-changing contenders, plus reporting on what shows are playing well with voters, TV Academy rules changes, interviews with potential nominees, and more. The Television Academy will be looking to honor programs that aired between June 1, 2025 and May 31, 2025, a period of time still reeling from the widespread contraction of work in the industry, as well as the wildfires that devastated Los Angeles in January. However, unlike last year, which was jam-packed with two Emmys ceremonies, but was short on returning series, the Outstanding Drama Series race alone has Emmy winners like “Severance,” “The White Lotus,” “The Last of Us,” “Squid Game,” and “The Handmaid’s Tale” all back in contention for more awards.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/bruno-mars-die-with-a-smile-apt.html'>Bruno Mars Found a Way to Get Even Bigger</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 19:09:17 <p>
Bruno Mars is one of the few figures in pop nearly everyone can agree on. He’s mastered mass appeal with easy-to-enjoy songs, undisputed vocal talent, and overflowing charisma. His four-quadrant, feel-good R&B hits — among them “Just the Way You Are,” “Uptown Funk!”, “That’s What I Like,” and Silk Sonic’s “Leave the Door Open” — are like nice watches: always reliable, stylish yet classic. It also debuted atop the Billboard Global 200 chart and stayed for eight weeks — only to be interrupted by another Mars duet, “APT.,” with Blackpink’s Rosé. That song allowed Mars to conquer Asia’s often-siloed markets — earning his first No. The most surprising aspect of Mars’s latest career boost is how counterintuitive his approach has been. What isn’t new for Mars is having a collaborative streak. We may think of him as a front-and-center showman, dancing, belting, and cheesing it up for the cameras. He got his start in the production group the Smeezingtons, working with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine to shepherd hits by Flo Rida and Cee Lo Green. Mars’s breakout as a singer came from singing the hook on songs for rappers B.o.B. His biggest hit, “Uptown Funk!”, was for someone else’s album. Even recently, he chose to follow the runaway success of 24K Magic by working with his friend Anderson .Paak in Silk Sonic. Mars’s own collaborator Lady Gaga has found considerable success on this path. Even Taylor Swift has been collaborating more widely than ever, featuring multiple guests on her recent albums and re-recorded vault tracks. But these team-ups can feel forced or calculated, like Swift’s “Karma” remix with Ice Spice, where the rapper sounded completely out of place. We’ve seen singers use duets to saturate the market as recently as last year, when Post Malone had features on Beyoncé and Swift’s albums, along with his own No. He managed to pull off two completely different-sounding hits: an adult-contemporary rock anthem and a peppy K-pop drinking song. Everything he does look smooth, and that hasn’t stopped yet.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The melancholy of coming of age is captured in the whimsically dark “Bonjour Tristesse,” based on Françoise Sagan’s 1954 novella whose title translates to “Hello, Sadness.” “Palm Trees and Power Lines” standout star Lily McInerny plays 18-year-old Cécile who is vacationing with her father Raymond (Claes Bang) and his lover Elsa (Naïlia Harzoune). As the synopsis teases, “Cécile’s world is threatened and, desperate to regain control, she sets in motion a plan to drive Anne away with tragic consequences. The three embark on an incredible journey of deceit, lust, compassion, and unconditional love against the backdrop of an unforgettable French summer.” Aliocha Schneider also stars. “Bonjour Tristesse” is writer/director Durga Chew-Bose’s directorial debut; the film premiered at 2024 TIFF. The IndieWire review compared the cold lushness of “Bonjour Tristesse” to a “memory,” with Kate Erbland writing, “It’s as if we’re trapped in a photo album of whatever Cécile happens to remember from that summer, a mish-mash of delightfully hazy moments and stilted, mannered lines.

Good thing “Novocaine” can’t feel pain, because this one hurts. 1 at the domestic box office this weekend despite grossing just $8.7 million. It will come as a surprise to no one that the box office has been bleak since the pandemic, but you don’t even have to go back that far to find a weekend that had a worse No. Among new releases, February 10-12 2023, had “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” open to only $8.3 million, beating out “Avatar: The Way of Water” in its ninth weekend in theaters. “The Invitation” in August 26-28 2022 was just a $6.8 million opening for No. According to Comscore, since the start of 2021, six films have opened below “Novocaine’s” $8.7 million and hit No. “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” opened during Super Bowl weekend and ended up adding over 1,500 screens in Week 2, mitigating its second weekend drop. “Novocaine” — and everything else that opened behind it — has less of an excuse. It was a wide release with 3,365 screens and opened in the middle of March when kids are starting to go on Spring Break and when more tentpoles are generally arriving. If you want to be optimistic, you can say that four of the Top 6 were original films, not sequels or based on an existing franchise. Not too shabby for a movie that Warner Bros. canceled and sold. The good news for “Novocaine” is that it will almost certainly still make a profit. The film was produced for just $18 million, pretty rare for a studio film, and got a B Cinemascore, so word of mouth should help this movie heading into Week 2. The way “Captain America: Brave New World” is shaping up, it’s on pace to finish below the $476 million grossed by “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.” Adult audiences haven’t given the time of day to a Soderbergh spy movie with Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender, a new Bong Joon Ho sci-fi head-trip, or a Marvel tentpole. Next weekend is Disney’s “Snow White,” which has been hounded by people angry at it on both sides of the political spectrum. If those don’t hit, then unlike “Novocaine,” everyone will be feeling the pain.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have spoken candidly about coparenting since their February 2021 split — but it hasn’t always gone smoothly. Two months after Kardashian filed for divorce, she and West both filed for joint custody of their brood. When they settled their split in November 2022, the former couple agreed to share legal and physical custody with “equal access” to the kids. West was also required to pay Kardashian $200,000 a month for child support and is responsible for 50 percent of their children’s educational and security expenses. Tension has grown between the exes over the years, with West claiming in October 2022 that the Kardashian-Jenner family barred him from attending Chicago’s birthday party earlier in the year. Kim’s sister Khloé Kardashian came to her defense via Instagram at the time. I don’t want to do this on social media but YOU keep bringing it here,” she commented on West’s since-deleted Instagram post. “You are the father of my nieces and nephews and I’m trying to be respectful but please STOP tearing Kimberly down and using our family when you want to deflect.

Harmony Korine‘s multimedia design collective EDGLRD may be a fresh-faced company, but the director is taking it one step further by using baby faces for AI avatars in his latest feature, “Baby Invasion.” The ultra-realistic, multiplayer FPS game (which is also billed as a film) follows a group of mercenaries using baby faces as avatars to conceal their identity. The official synopsis reads: “Tasked with entering mansions of the rich and powerful, players must explore every rabbit hole before time runs out. “Baby Invasion” made its world premiere out of competition at the 2024 Venice Film Festival, where IndieWire film editor Ryan Lattanzio wrote in the review that Korine’s pioneering vision purposefully subverts any audience expectations. […] ‘Baby Invasion’ has a clear focus: It’s to make you, the viewer, feel bad, and often wanting to beg to the screen, ‘Please god let this end,’ or perhaps more aptly, ‘end me.’ Here is a filmmaker who, these days, resents his own audience. Lattanzio continued, “‘Baby Invasion’ is not interested at all in what you think about it. Its disregard for the audience is gutsy on Korine’s part, a filmmaker who has long not just pushed buttons, but shoved them down your stupid throat and then smashed your trash head against the wall while daring you to look away even when you physically can’t, as much as you might crave to.” “[If] you’re not messing with the form a little bit, then what’s the point?” Korine told IndieWire of both “Aggro Dr1ft” and “Baby Invasion,” adding, “We’re making films now in gaming engines and working on a movie now that takes place in your living room, or in your bedroom. We’re at a place now where the level of tech is really starting to parallel my dreams.

England’s ITN Productions is behind a new 90-minute documentary titled He Said, She Said: Blake Lively vs Justin Baldoni, which is set to air on the U.K.’s Channel 5 on Monday, March 17. “Produced by ITN’s transatlantic team this special is a timely […] You see a lot of things, but the reality is this is not a circus when you go through an experience like this,” he explained. “In this day and age, the only way that you can truly get back is to prove your innocence and that’s what we’re actively working to [do],” he shared. Baldoni’s life has been put under the microscope ever since Lively, 37, filed a legal complaint against him in December 2024, accusing him of sexual harassment during the filming of their movie It Ends With Us. The actress also claimed that Baldoni, 41, attempted to launch a smear campaign against her. Baldoni denied Lively’s allegations and filed his own lawsuit against the Gossip Girl alum, her publicist, and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, in January. Before Baldoni and Lively’s trial is expected to begin in May 2026, Baldoni and his team launched a website with the URL of “thelawsuitinfo.com” to allow the public to access an “Amended Complaint” and “Timeline of Relevant Events.” “The website is actually a culmination of public pleadings that are publicly accessible and had been filed and they are easily accessible,” Freedman shared with Belloni.

AUSTIN, TX—In a drastic new order purportedly aimed at protecting its citizens, Texas state government officials reportedly put into effect a new mandatory six-month quarantine that would apply to anyone who has ever watched Will And Grace. “Anyone who watched Will And Grace, the sitcom that revolutionized the popular depiction of homosexuality in the United States in the mid-to-late 1990’s must undergo a mandatory quarantine period of 183 days,” said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in an official statement announcing the controversial measure aimed at preventing the statewide spread of dangerous references to refreshingly realistic depictions of gay life and sardonic quips from Karen Walker. “We must all take serious precautions to keep ourselves safe from Will And Grace—even a rerun is capable of doing serious damage. Watching merely 10 seconds of an episode of Will And Grace is enough to be irreversibly charmed by Jack McFarland’s free-spirited confidence.” Abbott added that those who have already been placed in quarantine may qualify for early release by finishing at least two seasons of Yellowstone or Blue Bloods.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Neil Young actually did take a look at his life and he’s a lot like … Robert Smith. Encouraged by the loud advocacy of the Cure’s front man, Young will no longer be selling Ticketmaster “platinum tickets” to fans. Writing about the decision on his website, Young referred to a 2024 interview with Smith, who at the time criticized “fucking stupid or lying” musicians who allowed dynamic pricing — a demand-driven payment structure — to be utilized for their concerts. “It’s this story that really helped me to realize that I have a choice to make and can make a difference for my music loving friends. My management and agent have always tried to cover my back on the road, getting me the best deals they could,” he explained. “They have tried to protect me and my fans from the scalpers who buy the best tickets and resell them at huge increases for their own profits.” Young now acknowledges, despite this attempt to dissuade scalpers, attendees were still unfairly stuck with a higher cost. “The money went to me,” he added. “That did not feel right.” If only other artists would take a similar antidote.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Jeremy Zimmer is passing the leadership torch to United Talent Agency president David Kramer. Kramer, who began his career in the UTA mailroom, will succeed Zimmer as CEO on June 1. As CEO, Kramer will oversee all strategic planning and operations of the company’s global business. He will continue to serve on the company’s board of directors, which is headed by Paul Wachter. Said Wachter: “We are thrilled to announce David as UTA’s next CEO. We are confident that his leadership and client-centric approach will position the Company for continued success. It’s been remarkable how much the Company has grown and succeeded over that period. Zimmer has led the agency’s evolution from boutique literary agency into a much broader global enterprise with expansion into music, sports, publishing, fashion and beauty, creators, and brand advisory. UTA’s partnership with Klutch Sports has grown to represent professional athletes across the NBA, WNBA, MLB, and NFL. To power that growth, UTA has gone through three rounds of outside institutional investment. “These 35 years at UTA have been so incredibly rewarding,” said Zimmer. “While transition is never easy, this particular moment feels very right. Zimmer outlined his own plans in an email to staff that Deadline obtained, and it is evident that retirement isn’t in his immediate plans: “I’m proud to announce that David Kramer will be the CEO of UTA beginning in June,” Zimmer wrote. “After helping to ensure a smooth transition, I will be moving on professionally. “The fact that I am ready for my next challenge doesn’t obviate how hard it will be to not walk in every morning to a place I love. “Special thanks to my fellow board members for all the good times and support. In the agency’s announcement, Kramer said he was “honored to serve as the next CEO of this incredible Company and work with our talented team of agents and executives who, unlike any other, prioritize clients above all else, and share a commitment to delivering tailored, impactful opportunities. Thanks to Jeremy’s vision and leadership, UTA has not only grown, but evolved into a more diversified, dynamic company, expanding into new areas, while strengthening our core business. In addition to representing a strong list of writer-director-producer clients, he distinguished himself as a strong strategic thinker who has guided the agency’s day-to-day business and helped shape its strategic growth in the filmed entertainment group, which includes motion picture literary, television literary, talent, production arts, and independent film, as well as the comedy touring and publishing divisions. Along the way, he has been a driver in the agency’s strategic growth including helping to bring strategic investor EQT to UTA and leading UTA’s acquisition of top UK literary and talent agency Curtis Brown Group.

Megan Moroney headlines Rolling Stone’s “Future of Music” showcase. South by Southwest may have begun as an independent music festival, but in the past few years, movies and tech have definitively overtaken the convention’s original focus. But, contrary to reports, SXSW won’t be cutting music entirely from its schedule. The Austin festival is paring back its schedule for 2026, from nine days to seven. This means there won’t be a dedicated music weekend that used to close the festival. But, a spokesperson confirmed to the Austin American-Statesman that music events “will take place throughout the entire event.” 2026 festival passes are currently on sale, including a music option. That’s not to say SXSW’s music arm is in a good spot going into 2026. And this year’s flagship showcases reportedly failed to sell out. Per the Statesman, the festival used free RSVPs to fill showcases by artists like ascendant pop star Benson Boone, while other artists like country breakout Megan Moroney couldn’t even sell out the 2,750-capacity ACL Live with those free passes. This also comes after more than 60 artists dropped out of the 2024 festival over its ties to the military-industrial complex.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This column originally appeared in Brian Moylan’s newsletter, The Housewives Institute Bulletin. It should surprise no one that Mike White, the creator, writer, and director of The White Lotus, is a fan of reality TV, considering he appeared on both The Amazing Race and Survivor. But we had no idea he was a huge Bravo fan. Well, now that you mention it, there are some striking similarities between many of this season’s characters and your favorite Bravolebs. • The Ratliff Family (Jason Isaacs, Parker Posey, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Sarah Catherine Hook, and Sam Nivola): They’re from the South, which is the obvious Southern Charm connection, but their dynamic brings a different Bravo family to mind: An eternally disengaged mother, a business-minded absent father who is oddly angry, a shockingly hot older son, a twink-y younger son questioning his sexuality, and a daughter who is barely there — are we sure this isn’t Meredith Marks and her clan? • Kate, Laurie, and Jaclyn (Leslie Bibb, Carrie Coon, and Michelle Monaghan): You thought I was going to say these three would be the Tres Amigas because they seem to be a trio, but one of them is always on the outs. But, no, I think they were inspired by a different threesome. One of them has gotten famous, the other two are resentful for it, but they also both talk shit about each other to the famous one. Yes, the famous one is Stassi Schroeder, and the other two are Katie Maloney Schwartz Maloney and Kristen Doute. If you just switch their accents, it’s PK and Dorit Kemsley. • Mook and Gaitok (Lalisa Manobal and Tayme Thapthimthong): They both work in hospitality at the same place, he’s been in love with her for years, and she barely seems to notice. This could be Maddi Reese and Joe Bradley from Southern Hospitality. • Greg / “Gary” (Jon Gries): He got rich thanks to his wife, and now he’s left her so he can go bopping around the globe on luxury trips with a bunch of “models.” This has to be Mauricio Umansky. • Valentin (Arnas Fedaravicius): The hot Russian “health mentor” seems like he might be trying to sleep with three women all in the same friend group.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

If hearing him on “Las Culturistas” and seeing him in “Wicked” and on “Saturday Night Live” wasn’t enough, Bowen Yang is headed back to the big screen alongside Academy Award-nominee Lily Gladstone, and Kelly Marie Tran in “The Wedding Banquet.” Yang is also joined by “Fire Island” collaborator Andrew Ahn, who serves as director and co-writer on this remake of the classic 1993 LGBTQ rom-com from Ang Lee. Co-written by the original film’s scribe James Schamus and also starring Han Gi-Chan, Joan Chen, and Oscar-winner Yuh-Jung Youn, the official synopsis for the film reads, “‘The Wedding Banquet’ follows a chosen family of four friends each struggling to navigate their adulthood responsibilities and relationships. Angela (Tran) and her partner Lee (Gladstone) have had repeated unsuccessful IVF treatments, and the financial strain is worsening. Min (Han) and his commitment-phobic boyfriend, Chris (Yang), can’t agree on taking their relationship to the next level, but Min’s student visa is running out. In an attempt to solve the friend group’s ever-growing problems, Min proposes marriage to Angela to secure his green card in exchange for funding Lee’s IVF treatment. The rudderless Chris and trust-fund endowed Min, meanwhile, are navigating Chris’s reluctance to commit to a marriage that would allow Min, who’s in danger of losing his green card, to stay in the country.” Speaking to IndieWire at Sundance, Gladstone shared that she was able to influence not only how her character is presented but even her name. “I decided that, because it takes place in Seattle, [and] there is a significantly underrepresented tribal entity fighting for federal recognition, that is Chief Seattle’s [Si’ahl’s] nation, Duwamish,” the actress said. “Aren’t currently federally recognized as a tribe, they’ve been trying to be … for some time. So, art is transcendence, it’s how we shape societies, it was important for me to make my character Duwamish.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Discovery after the corporate merger: “Looney Tunes” live-action hybrid film “Coyote vs. Acme” was scrapped by WBD in 2023 before the film was set to start streaming on Max, taking a $30 million tax write-off instead.

Kanye posted the song, called “Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine,” on X, where he claimed it was “by Puff Daddy,” on March 15.

Another SXSW has come and gone, bringing premieres of many of the biggest movies and shows coming out later in 2025. The multi-disciplinary event is so massive — covering everything from film and TV to music, virtual reality, comedy, and tech— that it often feels impossible to sift through everything on the schedule. But IndieWire was on the ground throughout the film and TV portion of the festival, and we’ve selected 15 film and TV projects that are worthy of your continued attention.

From star-studded headliners like Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s Hollywood satire “The Studio” and Christopher Landon’s latest horror effort “Drop” to small independent films, the festival offered an excellent slate of narrative and documentary projects for film and TV lovers of all stripes. Several of our favorites came from first-time directors, including Jing Ai Ng’s art crime thriller “Forge” and Matthew Shear’s neurotic story of missed connections “Fantasy Life.” There were also plenty of thrilling documentaries, from Michael Bay’s high-flying parkour saga “We Are Storror” to the reptile extermination film “The Python Hunt.”

SXSW enjoys a unique spot on the festival calendar, allowing it to help some films build on their momentum after playing Sundance and giving other films a platform before they reemerge on the fall festival circuit. And you never know when a SXSW film could establish itself as a player in next year’s awards race — just look back to “Everything Everywhere All at Once” as proof of what’s possible.

The Onion: How do you keep your voice in such great shape after all these years? Gaga: No, as I’ve gotten older and more mature I’ve learned to accept when something is just an irredeemable piece of shit. Gaga: Elvira, Mistress of the Dark and Flik from A Bug’s Life. Gaga: The threat of a 10% tariff on latex. The Onion: Why do you call your fans “little monsters”? Gaga: I find each and every one a threat to my personal safety.

CLEVELAND—Concluding that the rewards simply weren’t worth the risks, local man Tim Fitzpatrick told reporters Monday that he would leave his oversized leprechaun hat at home on St. Patrick’s Day to avoid damaging it. “Obviously, it’d be a dream to live it up at McKiernan’s with this thing on my head, but I’d just hate to see the brim get all bent out of shape,” said the 39-year-old, who cited concerns about wear and tear ruining the crown, emerald velvet fabric, or large golden buckle among his justifications for leaving behind the holiday-themed novelty hat. “I’m just going to wear one of my other smaller leprechaun hats. If someone asks to try one of those on and stretches out the sweatband, they can go wild. Hell, go ahead and steal it. I don’t mind. But not my big leprechaun hat. That’s special.” Fitzpatrick added that he had learned his lesson after a spilled beer forced him to throw out his favorite green-tassel and shamrock-embroidered glitter vest back in 2023.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Gaspar Noé has never been a filmmaker who shied away from controversy, and he’s ready to wade into what might be the most divisive topic in Hollywood: AI. The annual festival, which will be held in June 2025 with events in both New York and Los Angeles, celebrates short films composed of generative AI. Noé will serve on a Jury Panel that also includes Tribeca Enterprises CEO Jane Rosenthal, IMAX Head of Post and Image Capture Bruce Markoe, and Lionsgate Senior Vice President of Visual Effects Brianna Domont, among others. “Discovering the work that’s been made with this new technology is fascinating. I am always beyond curious to see how young filmmakers are now reinventing the art of visual storytelling with these incredible tools.” “At Runway, we’re constantly pushing the boundaries of storytelling and creativity, something Gaspar has always done with his films. His eye for talent and embrace of new technologies fits perfectly with AIFF’s ethos.” In addition to his new AI gig, Noé is also hoping to dip his toes into some new genres of filmmaking. In a November 2024 interview with Variety, the filmmaker explained that he’d be open to making a children’s movie in the near future. Probably I should even try to mix those three genres,” Noé said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Voice of Documentary Filmmakers and Public Media May Be Next</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 13:00:00 <p>
In the Trump Administration’s latest attack on free speech and public media, the President signed an executive order March 15 that effectively shut down the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees Voice of America as well as a host of other international broadcasting entities such as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. This has heightened anxieties for diverse documentary filmmakers and organizations that already were threatened by the authoritarian political administration. Many in the documentary field are specifically concerned about the upcoming Congressional Oversight DOGE subcommittee hearing on federal funding of public media tentatively scheduled for March 26, where presidents and CEOs of NPR and PBS, Katherine Maher and Paula Kerger, respectively, have been called to testify. The hearing will be chaired by Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has accused both NPR and PBS of producing “systemically biased” content. “There are a lot of people in the PBS system who are afraid about what they can program, and that definitely affects the films we produce,” said one documentary funder, whose work centers on underrepresented filmmakers. It’s probably true that they’ll stay away from trans experiences and Palestinian stories, but is climate change going to be okay? While the President’s anti-DEIA and “gender ideology” orders continue to be litigated in the courts, there remain plenty of examples of “anticipatory obedience,” said documentary filmmaker Razi Jafri. “We don’t make editorial decisions because a funder tells us to,” he said. Many documentary organizations supporting marginalized groups are trying to lay low for now. But they also recognize “that we can’t just run and hide,” said another executive director. NEA spokespeople recently held public information sessions that suggested its grants are open to applicants from diverse groups, such as American Indian or Hispanic-serving institutions, for example. Organizations must also sign a kind of anti-DEI loyalty pledge, an “assurance of compliance,” which ensures applicants “will not operate any programs promoting ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI) that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws, in accordance with Executive Order No. Since many expect federal funding for public media to be fully cut or severely diminished, philanthropic and private donors have been given increased attention to fill the gap. A leader in the nonfiction nonprofit sector said it’s too early to tell what major philanthropists might do, although one of their funders is now giving less to all their grantees. “Will people step back from film and head to frontline orgs more?” they said. While some suggest that U.S.-based documentary filmmakers might seek funding help overseas in international co-productions, veteran documentary producer and consultant Louise Rosen is quick to shut down the idea. “Under such circumstances, international support for U.S. projects seems unlikely and potentially highly controversial. And besides, because of our historic lack of federal and regional indie film funding, with few exceptions, US makers have never really had much to reciprocate with nor have they actively cultivated those relationships.” She said, “There is some resentment not dissimilar to the feeling many here have towards the Democratic party… ‘How did you let this happen?’ So I won’t be surprised by implicit or explicit boycotting of U.S. films.” Stay tuned for more IndieWire coverage on how Trump’s anti-DEIA actions will impact fiction storytelling and the private sector.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/best-anime-streaming-services.html'>The Best Anime Streaming Services of All</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 13:00:00 <p>
Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos by Funimation, CrunchyRoll, Hulu and Amazon Prime From the moment Astro Boy first aired on NBC in 1963, anime has been a part of American TV-watching habits, whether audiences knew they were watching anime, or thought it was just another cartoon. But we’re long past the times where anime shows were reedited and repackaged into entirely new shows like Robotech and Voltron. You can usually watch the latest episodes of your favorite show mere hours after their initial Japanese broadcast, whether at niche, dedicated streaming services or at the larger players acquiring major simulcast licenses and financing original productions. That being said, as streaming companies have come to understand the business opportunities that hoards of anime fans represent, corporate mergers have led to the end of streamers like VRV and Funimation. Despite closures like those, each platform usually has its own set of exclusive titles, meaning anime fans have more choices to make than ever before if they want to catch their favorite shows. Crunchyroll, which has titles like Jujutsu Kaisen and a just-announced Nintendo Switch app. This is where you go if you want the single biggest library of titles, where you find both Jujutsu Kaisen and Solo Leveling streaming right next to Planetes, Ping Pong the Animation, and the original Dragon Ball. Every new season brings dozens of new and returning anime, most of them streaming exclusively on this platform, giving you more anime than you can possibly watch. Even if anime hits like Attack on Titan and Dan Da Dan can be found on other platforms, Crunchyroll’s biggest strength is its library of exclusives, one that also boasts original productions like Shenmue: The Animation. Availability and support: Crunchyroll is available on consoles (including the Nintendo Switch, which doesn’t offer many streaming services), mobile devices, Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, and Amazon Fire. Crunchyroll is also a rare streamer with subtitles and dubbing in multiple languages available worldwide (not just geo-locked to your location) including Spanish, German, Russian, and Arabic. Cost: The service has an ad-supported free tier, but it is severely limited. Rather than prioritizing titles about high-schoolers with superpowers, this streamer prides itself in a more focused library that offers edgier shows like Dororo and the original When They Cry, or outright disturbing yet intriguing titles like Elfen Lied and Made in Abyss. It even has classic shows like earlier Lupin the Third and Princess Tutu. And for those not looking forward to straight mature content, HIDIVE’s other specialization is its library of shojo anime that’s aimed at teenage girls. Even if shows like Dragon Ball are missing here, you will find K-On!, the great Oshi No Ko, and even Hideaki Anno’s first masterpiece, Gunbuster. In a way, HIDIVE is the Nintendo to Crunchyroll’s Xbox. The app is somewhat lackluster and offers no offline viewing, but many titles offer subtitles in multiple languages. Availability and support: The app is available on mobile, Chromecast, Apple TV, Android TV, Roku, and Xbox One (sorry, PlayStation gamers). That means entries like Ninja Scroll and Great Teacher Onizuka, but also the notoriously unhinged English dub of Ghost Stories and Aim for the Ace!. It’s a great place to discover shows like Lady Oscar: The Rose of Versailles and the original Astro Boy — classics known for their influence on future generations. What RetroCrush lacks in fancy aesthetics or wider platform support, it compensates for with a “randomize” button that replaces hours of deciding what to watch with just the click of a button — kind of like channel surfing, but for anime. Of course you don’t, but what may actually surprise you is that Netflix has a pretty great anime library that includes both modern classics like Hunter x Hunter and recent hits like Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End. Still, where Netflix shines the most is in its library of exclusives — both original productions and acquisitions. You can also stream the hugely influential Neon Genesis Evangelion exclusively on Netflix. From the masterclass of storytelling that is Pluto, to the delightful Pokémon Concierge, Netflix constantly releases stunning new shows that push the medium forward while also producing some stunning collaborations with impressive studios like Scott Pilgrim Takes Off and Cyberpunk Edgerunners. Nowadays, we get shows like Delicious in Dungeon not only getting new episodes out the same day as Japan, but even same-day dubs alongside the subbed version. Netflix seems to be Crunchyroll’s biggest competitor, and has now become a must-have streaming service for anime fans — alongside everyone else. Cost: Netflix’s price starts at $8 per month for the ad-supported plan, with the 4K plan setting you back $25 per month. The streamer has a good collection of popular modern shows like Blue Lock, Attack on Titan, My Hero Academia, and Dragon Ball Daima but also older titles like Inuyasha and the original Ranma 1/2. Hulu now has exclusive titles too, joining the anime streaming wars with shows like Undead Unluck, the hilarious Power Rangers parody Go! Loser Ranger!, and the Bleach revival Thousand-Year Blood War. The big problem with Hulu is that the service often suffers from subtitling issues as well as big delays like Netflix used to. Availability and support: Hulu works on most devices (including the Nintendo Switch), but it only offers English subtitles. Sadly, following Sony’s acquisition of Crunchyroll, Max has all but removed its anime library. Additionally, Max has exclusive titles in the form of Adult Swim anime productions like “what if John Wick was an anime ninja?” Ninja Kamui, as well as the upcoming Lazarus by Cowboy Bebop creator Shinichiro Watanabe. Availability and support: Max only offers subtitles in English, but it is available on all major devices. Prime Video is a bit of a dark horse in the anime-streaming race as it doesn’t offer nearly as many titles as other services, but there are still some great shows to discover, from Banana Fish to Dororo. A service that is completely free yet has a great selection of old and new anime, Tubi should not be overlooked when it comes to anime streaming. This ad-supported service includes classic movies like Akira, Paprika, and the fantastic anthology Memories (featuring shorts from the directors of Akira, Wolf’s Rain, and Perfect Blue). When it comes to TV shows, Tubi offers a variety of titles from Cardcaptor Sakura and Ouran High School Host Club to Yu-Gi-Oh! As a rare exclusive, you can watch the 2022 movie Blue Thermal here. Even if Tubi may not necessarily make for the best single source of anime, it is both a great introduction to the medium and a free additional service to have in your anime journey. One aspect where it stands out from other services, even anime-centric ones is that it has a Spanish dub for several of their shows, including Knights of the Zodiac (a show that is infinitely superior in Spanish over English).

Intimate spoilers for The White Lotus season three episode five follow. Toward the end of White Lotus season three episode five, Lochlan (Sam Nivola) and Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), in the throes of a non-specific high, end up back in a room with Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood), who they’ve been attempting to flirt with for several episodes now. Saxon gets Lochlan and Chloe (not siblings) to kiss. Finally, with minor cajoling from the girls, Lochlan walks over to Saxon and gives him a peck on the lips. There was definitely no tongue but lots of effort. “Well obviously they’re not brothers by blood, so that made it easier,” Le Bon said of the filming process in a March 16 Vulture interview. Because if you don’t do it well the first time, then you have to do it over and over again. We all thought he was going to throw up. It really shouldn’t have been a surprise — before the season even began, a profile of White Lotus creator Mike White in The New Yorker promised that, “The new season includes a hint of incest, or perhaps more than a hint.” As in, there is still more to come. A March 17 profile of Schwarzenegger in the New York Times promised that his role required “nudity and at least one disturbing sex scene.” At least!</p></b><br/><br/></div>

That Book Was, By Design, A Conventional Literary Novel, One That Explored Questions of Transition Through a Clever, and Ultimatelly Brutal, Reimagining of the Marriage plot. Peters's New Book, Stag Dance, Feels Like A Radical Departure From That Approach-And In A Way, A Radical Return to It, SINCE THE THREE STORES COLLECTED ALONGSIDE THE TITULAR NEW NOVEL WERE WERE Originally Self-Public. The Book's Cast Includes Boarding-School Jocks, Fetishists in Full-Body Rubber Suits, Lonely Lumberjacks Going Courting in the Depths of Winter. Peters has discovered a Great Secret That Eludes Many Marginalized Writers, Obscured from Them by Publishers, Critics, and the Pall Of Their Own Anxiety: Sometimes the Best Way to Write About Your Experience is to Stop Assuming You Know What Your Exper I recently spoke with Peters at her book launch at the beach in New York, where she delved into her new experiments with style, The Limitations of the Trans-Cis Binary, and What Old-Timey Loggers Called Chewing Tobacco. At the time, Andrea's incredible essay "on Liking Women" had just come out, and I was probly a bit jealous. I was like, this young upstart wrote a better essay than me. Not only did she publish it, but being a good reporter, she called Andrea and Said, “This is what Torrey Said about you. Andrea responded very eloquently and I think correctly. But it was a period in my life where I was having a breakup, so I got distracted. I was like, well, three are pretty good pieces. And I was like, Thank good in got distracted. In Mean, I don't want to roast you. You Clearly have a big presentation in the morning. I do want to know, if you are here, who is working security at Dylan Mulvaney's Book Launch? You look like the surprise guest at a Business-Casual Gender-Reveal Party. And I don't have that Opinion about a lot of things. I have all these questions about time and temporality, but the most surface-level version of that is: there is new stuff, and there's old stuff in this collection. DO WONDERING HOW IT ALL CAME TARETHER AND WHAT IT'S LIKE HAVE MATERIAL THAT PREDATES DetRansition, Baby Sitting Alongside The New Stuff. The First Piece in the Collection is Called Infect Your Friends and Loved Ones, Which I Originally Self-Pubished in 2015. It was like, well, The Publishing Industry is not going to publish my work. And so, The Original Publication was Full of Typos. There Were Sentences that did not totally work. I Wanted People to Pick Up This Book and Say, “You don't need an IMMACULATE PAGE IN ORDER TO Move Readers. Not the person who was willing to take risks. And then Stag Dance, The Main Story in the Book, Is Complely Written in This Weird Lumberjack Slang. The story of a bunch of loggers, who would work these long winter camps and, when they got lonely, they'd put on a dance, and some of the men would dance as women. They would cut out a little brown Fabric Triangle and they Paste the triangle upside down over their crotch. Anyone who showed up with that little triangle played the role of a woman and danced with all of the other men in these isolated camps in the west. But in some way that narrative was a reaction to detrrans, baby. It was like, “you wrote this comedy of manners. How are you going to follow it up? ” And I was like, “You know what no one wants? And in a weird way, that totally freed me. And so it seat strange with infect your friends and loved ones, but for me, that resonance produced something really interesting. One of the things in would be interesting in hearing you talk about is, one, the decision to write about non-trans or SLIGHTLY trans characters but also the decision to explore these strange genre places, wheres more about litt bits of Language and Feel. In a lot of way, trying to write about the feelings that I have in these words made the feelings new to me. A phrase like gender dysphoria, when I say it now, Feels so overdemined. Babe Bunyan, in the novel, Says, "Mirrors do not and litigate me." I was like, that is how it feels. And I would never have said that if I was not pretending to be a logger to myself. Very Interested in Having My Characters Not Know Things. Partly because of the time; Babe Bunyan Can't Know Anything. And in that story there's a kind of soccer-playing-bridge type, who starts hooking up with his roommate, who's femme. And neither one of them know exactly what's going on. If you know me as an Author, you would probly say, “All right, this robbie character is probly a pre-transition trans girl,“ But the character don't know that. And so it opens up a whole thing. It is something that comes through with a number of different characters in the book. I think you have said that you are less interesting in the binary between and women and more interesting in the binary between whatever a trans person is and what cis person is - that a cis woman who like pretty dresses in her 20s, and work in her 50 Non-Trivial Way. It seems like a lot of what the book is trying to do, in my mind, is create a kind of space for freedom between the present, five years from now, ten years from now, and also five minutes from now - that gender is something to have been life. In the story the masks, there's a sissy who's into online sissy culture and she goes to vegas, where two people want to take her under their wings. One is a trans woman, Who's Probably Very Into Respectability Politics and the “Corract” Way to be a woman. And that person, in think, husband, a very compelling case for doing it his way, which is basic, like, he's a doctor and he gets to go dress up and have great, wild, fetishistic sex, then go back to bector and being respected. And meanwhile, this idea that you have to transition and you have to tell everybody that you do this thing - it did not look that appealing in the story. And the Attempt to give a boundary to that, we are learning, is not actually a good thing. We're Already Seeing the Weaponization of Certainty Against Trans People. But then the question becomes, "If community can be found in a group of people, then how do you think about it?" How do you constitute that kind of thing? And a lot of these stories are invitations to a reader to identify with these characters who are probly not like them. Is about Taking Away The Markers of What It Means to Be Trans, and Instead Looking at the Emotional Building Blocks of This Experience, which are often Pretty Universal Things, Like the Difference Between How You're Seen and How You Want To Be Seen. What's The Difference Between How People Want to See Me and How I Want to Be Seen? ” So I think the way I want to approach ethics and politics is through the door of emotion, where people can be like, "oh yeah, in kind of get that." Then they have the abilities to THINK THROUGH AND DISCER all kinds of stuff, because they feld something first. Four Characters in the book actively identify as trans and the rest are just people going through weird feelings, which is all of us, which means that there's an affinity and a solidarity for all of us who have weird feeling. And notable, I think at the Least Three of the Four Actively Trans-Identifying Characters Sort of Won Not Shut Up About It. Then when we're think about these sort of limal characters who may never even cross the threshold into transness, there is this sense that is something, inso as it exist, just exists in their heads. On the one hand, you want it to feel intuitive. I have no idea what the resolution between these things is, but there is a particular kind of problems in the trans case, in that asserting consciousness is part of the identity. In Kind of Feel Like the Party Line Around Trans Stuff is, like, you Declare Yourself a Thing, you come up with a Language for it, then you are that thing. But in fact, what babe bunyan runs into - which I feld very free to do in logger slang, and which feld more fraught to approach in contemporary language - is that declaring one's gene ends up bee a negotiation with all these peoples. And that because is a negotiation with all these people around you, not the same for every single person. And I think that is unfair, and really hard to talk about, because it produces jealousies even within the trans community. And that's not something like like I could talk about in a contemporary sort of story, but I Could Create a Mythic Lumberjack Who Can Talk About that Kind of Stuff and Be Frustrated Over That Unfairness.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Let us rejoice: John Mulaney, Richard Kind, and Saymo are gracing our screens in tandem again. Despite the chaos and unpredictability baked into the show’s format, one thing we know to expect is an unlikely mishmash of guests. “This will be the one place where you could see Arnold Schwarzenegger sitting next to Nikki Glaser sitting next to a family therapist with music by Mannequin Pussy,” the comedian joked during Netflix’s Next on Netflix event in January. With the show finally hitting our screens, we don’t have to deal in hypotheticals any longer. Below, everything we know so far, including a trailer and this week’s special guests. March 12: Michael Keaton, Joan Baez, Fred Armisen, personal finance columnist Jessica Roy, and music from Cypress Hill. “Let me know when you’re tight enough that I should say the line,” he says as the drone camera slowly creeps in. “Is someone going to cue me … I just want to be tight enough that saying the line makes sense.” Because, if we learned anything from the first iteration of this show, “making sense” is undeniably one of its creative priorities. Aside from revealing that the show would be less L.A.-centric than its predecessor and that his two beloved sidekicks would be returning, the comedian gave an address light on details but heavy on jokes. “We will be live globally with no delay,” he said. Netflix will always provide us with data that we will ignore.” Elsewhere, he joked that “there is absolutely nothing new” about the show’s conceit, but that he is simply “taking a lot of elements other people have already done and doing them out of order so” it feels fresh by default. “Not since Harry and Meghan has Netflix given more money to someone without a specific plan,” he said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/neil-young-lost-albums-ranked-best-to-worst.html'>Neil Young’s Lost Albums, Ranked</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 09:00:18 <p>
“I’m not talkin’ about sittin’ down with a pen and paper, I’m talkin’ about pickin’ up a guitar, lookin’ me in the face, and in 20 minutes — ‘Pocahontas.’” Like all good rock-and-roll mythmaking, Briggs’s version of events doesn’t entirely hold up to scrutiny; Shakey clarifies elsewhere that Young started toying with “Powderfinger” in the late ’60s, and it wouldn’t exactly come as a shock to learn that the free-associative final verse on “Pocahontas” about the Astrodome and Marlon Brando was written in a drug-adjacent fit of inspiration. Since 2017, as an offshoot of the Neil Young Archives, Young has debuted a steady stream of so-called “lost” albums — completed records that he intended to drop when he made them but ultimately decided to shelve for one reason or another. In most cases, he succeeded, so the lost albums are full of alternate takes on songs that ended up elsewhere, in addition to the occasional unreleased gem or abandoned curio. While that means the lost records don’t contain too many songs Neil-heads haven’t already heard in one form or another, they do provide a window into how Young chiseled a defining era of his career out of a massive slab of raw music. “What if” scenarios and alternate timelines abound on these projects, but how do they work as actual albums? I’ve tried to assess that below, but first, some ground rules: I’ve included only the projects that were conceived as studio albums, completed, and then shelved. This means no Early Daze — the compilation that Young recently put out of his early-career studio sessions with Crazy Horse. And Young has to have put the record out as a stand-alone release, so no albums like 1982’s Island in the Sun or 1987’s Summer Songs, which are only available, for now, in a recent $240 Neil Young Archives box set. For a guy whose catalogue has plenty of earnest, devastatingly romantic tunes, Young can still be cagey about what parts of himself he chooses to put out there — a quality that might explain why there are two records on this list that he initially buried because he felt they were too sad. The first is Toast, a collection he recorded with Crazy Horse shortly before scrapping it in favor of 2002’s Are You Passionate?, an R&B genre experiment on which he swapped out the Horse for ’60s soul legends Booker T. & the M.G.’s. Four of the seven songs on Toast wound up on Are You Passionate?, but it’s shocking how little of their usual fast-and-loose, dive-bar-band energy the Crazy Horse boys manage to inject into those songs, often sounding instead like they’re doing an (impressive!) By 1978, casual fans who threw on Harvest at dinner parties had likely all but given up on Young ever returning to the radio-ready folk sound of “Heart of Gold.” But after his detour into downer classics like Tonight’s the Night, Young was ready to throw those folks some red meat. The result was Comes a Time, an upbeat country-folk record that quickly outsold all six albums since Harvest. Oceanside Countryside comes from that same vein (even sharing a few songs with Comes a Time) and has a compelling formal conceit: The first five tracks were recorded solo in Florida and Malibu and thus comprise the “Oceanside” half, while Young recorded the more hoedown-friendly “Countryside” songs on the B-side with a full band in Nashville. That said, there’s not much that’s new here, and while I’ve tried to judge the albums on this list in a vacuum, it’s hard not to think while listening to Oceanside Countryside that Young made the right choice putting out Comes a Time instead. Between 1975 and 1977, he spent many a full moon holed up in a studio with Briggs at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, attempting to record songs at the same breakneck speed he was writing them. My only gripe is that it may have technically been recorded under a waning gibbous. When Neil played the then-unreleased Chrome Dreams for Carole King in 1977, she laughed at him, saying it was hardly a proper album, and that Young played solo on too many songs. (In 2007, Young called a totally unrelated album Chrome Dreams II — meaning the sequel technically got released first.) Despite the semantics of King’s critique, Chrome Dreams carries a strange power that makes it more coherent in retrospect. Many of the songs here wound up as the centerpieces of the albums they eventually landed on (e.g., “Like a Hurricane” on American Stars ’N Bars), so listening to Chrome Dreams feels a bit like bearing witness to Young’s universe before its Big Bang, seeing all the pieces in one place before they scattered to their eventual homes. When he finally released Homegrown in 2020, Young called it the missing link between Harvest and Comes a Time, presumably because it represents a partial return to the soft-folk sound of his most popular music. For instance, it’s hard to imagine how anyone could hide away a great song for almost 50 years that features Levon Helm on the drums, until you hear “Separate Ways,” the devastatingly intimate Homegrown opener about co-parenting amid a breakup (“Sharin’ our little boy / Who grew from joy back then”). “Try,” a casually indelible little folk tune with Emmylou Harris singing backup, sounds on its face like any number of lilting, romantic Neil songs from the early ’70s. But it, too, is intimately ensnared in Young’s relationship with Snodgress, with its best line — “I’d like to take a chance / But shit, Mary, I can’t dance” — referring to something her then-recently deceased mother used to say. The rest of Homegrown plays out like a tour through Young’s different personas at the time, shuffling through rootsy Americana (“Love Is a Rose”) and grungy rockers (“Vacancy”), with a delicate love song or two (“Kansas”) along the way. It probably would’ve satisfied a broader audience than Tonight’s the Night in 1975, but emerging in the throes of 2020, it felt like a small miracle.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/best-st-patricks-day-tv-episodes-streaming.html'>Best St. Patrick’s Day TV Episodes on Streaming</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 09:00:00 <p>
But if you’d rather watch the wild antics from afar than head to your local pub and drain it of cheap, we’ve got your solution — 11 of the best St. Patrick’s Day TV episodes, many of which feature magic and hedonism to enjoy vicariously. It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, “Charlie Catches a Leprechaun” (Season 11, Episode 8) In an otherwise pretty weak season, “Charlie Catches a Leprechaun” makes the most of Charlie’s endearing childlike curiosity and gullibility while Dennis tries to streamline the bar with a booze-selling wagon. Bob’s Burgers, “Flat-Top O’ the Morning to Ya” (Season 10, Episode 16) Here Linda and Teddy get a little too in the festive spirit. It starts innocently enough with an Irish-themed breakfast, but Bob is keen to keep things classy (and not green) in the restaurant. But their enthusiasm doesn’t quite rub off on the customers, who’d rather not chow down green meat. Bonus points if you can spot Walt lurking in the background of every shot. He gives Sabrina three golden coupons that grant her wishes; which, as we know, never goes well. She turns Salem into a man, but his essence is placed into a boy at school, leading to his attempts to take over the world. It’s a silly, fun episode with no real stakes but lots of ridiculousness and capers all round — perfect for the holiday. In “No Tomorrow,” the How I Met Your Mother gang gives into the green hedonism of St Patrick’s Day after attempting to stay at home and have a board-game night. When Barney convinces Ted that the day has no consequences, Ted goes hog wild on behaving badly and finds that his bad deeds actually reward him: For one night only, he can live consequence-free, just like Barney. While Ted doesn’t feel too pleased with himself afterward, there is a lesson in here that every St. Paddy’s Day reveler seems to hope to be true: that your behavior on that night is, if not inconsequential, then forgivable. Naturally, more than one show on this list takes place in a bar. As in the Sunny episode, the stakes are more about business and pride than having wild, raucous fun — partly because, well, running a bar over St. Patrick’s Day probably isn’t that much fun, but it definitely brings in a lot of money. Catch this episode of Cheers and then spare a thought (and a big tip) for your local bartender if you go out this weekend. Elsewhere, Jenna and Tracy each fight to be lead host of the St Patrick’s Day parade. It’s a perfect 30 Rock episode, full of arguments, megalomania, and general disdain, all heightened by the holiday. A demon is out killing leprechauns and stealing their magic, so the Charmed Ones, as always, step in to help. Luckily, the holiday falls on a weekend this year, which means those so inclined can get in their partying without worrying about work. Not so in this classic episode of The Office, in which Dunder Mifflin’s employees are all stuck at work after being made to stay later by Jo. Eventually, Michael is forced to be direct with Jo and tell her he’s letting the employees leave. She relents, and we have a happy ending, as the employees get to enjoy their St. Patrick’s Day in a bar, as it was intended by St. Patrick himself. St. Patrick’s Day should be a time for hedonism and letting loose, but in this Home Improvement episode, Wilson’s visiting niece, Willow, has a bit too much fun, failing to return home from the club and scaring everyone into sending out a search party. It’s a holiday episode within a holiday episode — Tim and Al wear lots of green, the set is dressed in Guinness merch, there’s Irish-themed improvement projects, and Tim opens with an attempt at an offensive limerick. It’s an episode that proves that all you really need to celebrate holiday (even on a Tuesday) is to get into the spirit, which might just mean painting your toolbox green. As with many festive and outgoing holidays, a lot of us more introverted types might find ourselves grudgingly trying to join the fun even if it’s not quite our bag. That’s what happens in 2 Broke Girls’ “And the Kilt Trip” when, seeking to fit in with Max and her other friends, Caroline joins everyone to get crazy at the St. Patrick’s Day parade. Surprise: She has a not-so-great time, and instead longs to enjoy her own old holiday traditions at the Plaza Hotel.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/2025-oscar-nominated-movies-streaming-watch.html'>How to Watch All of This Year’s Oscar Winners and Nominees</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 09:00:00 <p>
The recently crowned Best Picture winner Anora is finally streaming on Hulu. This article is updated regularly as Oscar contenders enter theaters and streaming services. On March 2, the Academy awarded the best films, performances, and craft of 2024 in a madcap broadcast hosted by Conan O’Brien. There were some surprises, some snubs, some sermons, and a sweep of five categories by Best Picture winner Anora, which ceded ground on only one of its nominations. In the afterglow of all the accolades you may be wondering: Where can I see all these movies? With so many streaming services and companies taking different paths to bring their A-list projects to viewers, it can be overwhelming work to simply track down these acclaimed titles. If you need to catch up, we’re here to help with detailed information on the streaming availability of every single feature nominee. Don’t plan on leaving the house anytime soon. How to Watch the 10 Best Picture Nominees Also nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The Awards Chatter: It started with the Palme d’Or at 2024’s Cannes, a prize won by recent Oscar darlings like Anatomy of a Fall, Triangle of Sadness, and Parasite. The latest from the genius behind Tangerine and The Florida Project brought Sean Baker back into the Oscar fold: Star Mikey Madison won Best Actress while Baker himself personally earned four awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. The Awards Chatter: The second-most nominated film of this year’s Oscars got to double digits because of its remarkable ensemble and technical achievements. The epic drama starring Adrien Brody as a Hungarian architect in postwar America started its run at Venice, where it won the Silver Lion, and went through waves of critics groups (it won Best Picture at Chicago, for example). It was a big winner at the Globes, taking home Best Picture (Drama), Actor, and Director. It may not have won quite as many on Oscars night, but it did give Brody his moment (or a few). The Awards Chatter: The Academy loves biopics, and that didn’t change this year with the nominations for this story of an essential chapter in music history. Timothée Chalamet landed his second nomination for playing Bob Dylan in James Mangold’s acclaimed drama about the folk-music legend, joined by Edward Norton and Monica Barbaro as Pete Seeger and Joan Baez, respectively. The Awards Chatter: This papal drama launched its way through awards season, notching citations from every major group on its way to a bunch of big Oscar nods, including Ralph Fiennes, Isabella Rossellini, and Peter Straughan for Best Adapted Screenplay. It was one of the few Best Picture nominees this year that (mostly) didn’t seem to make some people mad. Fiennes went home Oscar-less yet again this year, but at least the whole cast earned Outstanding Ensemble at the SAGs a week earlier. The Awards Chatter: The first Dune in this series landed ten Oscar nominations, winning six, more than any other film from 2022. Part Two didn’t exactly replicate that success, likely hurt by being released so early in 2024. Still, it found its way across the awards season desert yet again. The Awards Chatter: One of the most divisive films of the year turned out to be an awards-season juggernaut, landing as many Oscar nominations as Oppenheimer did last year and falling one short of tying the all-time record. The Jacques Audiard–directed musical-crime film’s run actually started much earlier, when it won three prizes at Cannes, including a special joint Best Actress award for stars Karla Sofía Gascón, Selena Gomez, Adriana Paz, and Zoe Saldaña. Won for Best International Feature Film. The Awards Chatter: The phenomenal Fernanda Torres was a surprising but deserving winner of the Golden Globe for Best Actress (Drama) for this devastating story of a woman dealing with the disappearance of her husband by the Brazilian government. A deeply personal project for Torres, it co-stars her mother, Fernande Montenegro, herself an Oscar nominee for 1998’s Central Station, which like this film was also directed by Walter Salles. The Awards Chatter: An adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s celebrated novel, this RaMell Ross drama has been a critical darling since its fest-season debuts. Nickel Boys won Best Director at Gotham and the New York Film Critics Circle before landing five Critics Choice nods, including Best Picture, and two Independent Spirit nominations. It only got one Golden Globe nomination, but it was a biggie: Best Picture. And it continued that odd trend at the Oscars, getting only two nods, including the big one, though it didn’t win any. Won for Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling. The Awards Chatter: It’s hard to believe this was the film that broke through the Academy’s blind spot when it comes to horror, but we were happy it did. The Demi Moore–starring film was a stronger-than-predicted performer all year, all the way back to a Best Screenplay win at Cannes in May 2024. It rolled its bloody carcass through the season, including a memorable win for Demi Moore at the Golden Globes. It certainly felt like the Oscars couldn’t ignore her performance in the acting category, right up until the moment she lost. Won for Best Achievement in Costume Design and Best Achievement in Production Design. The Awards Chatter: Was the biggest movie on this list also a major Oscars player? Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo may not have gone home awarded, but the film’s Production Design victory was well-earned, as was Paul Tazewell’s for Best Costume Design: He’s the first Black man to win an Oscar for the category. How to Watch It: Available to rent or own on demand; streaming on Peacock March 21. Nominated for Best Achievement in Visual Effects Fede Alvarez’s hit reboot of one of the most popular franchises of all time notched a visual effects nomination that’s probably more for the creatures than the janky resurrection of a certain character from a past movie. The performances by Sebastian Stan as Donald J. Trump and Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn were too much for the Academy to ignore this twisted origin story of a monster. Nominated for Best Achievement in Visual Effects While news stories touted how much money Paramount lost on this unique Robbie Williams biopic, at least they got an Oscar nomination out of the deal. This is a harrowing true story of a sexual assault investigation in Japan that launched at Sundance almost exactly a year before its Oscar nomination. Nominated for Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling Another Sundance debut, some thought this clever film would have appeared in more categories come Oscars night. The evening may not have gone its way, but viewers will appreciate its canny performances by Sebastian Stan, Adam Pearson, and Renate Reinsve for years to come. This documentary about the life of Elton John features a new song by Sir Elton himself — one so powerful that it became the title of the film and earned a nod for Best Original Song. Also nominated for Best International Feature Film. Gints Zilbalodis’s dialogue-free gem has been one of the most awarded animated films of its era — a streak that culminated with the first Academy Award for a Latvian film. Nominated for Best International Feature Film Though it didn’t ultimately win, the striking black-and-white cinematography made this this dark period piece one of the most visually distinct films of the Oscars set. Nominated for Best Achievement in Costume Design Once viewed as a multi-category juggernaut like the original film, this fell short and notched only one costume design nomination. And it was the highest-grossing animated film ever. Nominated for Best Achievement in Visual Effects Another nomination that felt inevitable, because these Apes films have revolutionized motion-capture performance, and the new one pushed that technology forward yet again. Nominated for Best Achievement in Cinematography Pablo Larraín completed his trilogy of 20th-century women (following Jackie and Spencer) with this story of Maria Callas that missed the categories where many had predicted it — actress for Angelina Jolie and costumes — but did land a nomination in cinematography. This beautiful little gem from the director of Mary & Max pushed out possible contenders from big studios to land a deserved nomination. It proved too powerful to miss, as did the filmmakers’ speech on Oscars night. How to Watch It: In theaters. Robert Eggers and the Academy don’t go hand in hand, but this one’s technical achievements couldn’t be ignored. Despite its losses, Nosferatu’s nominations were another case of a genre film being recognized this year (like The Substance) when it felt like the Academy would have skipped it just a few years ago. The documentary branch does love timeliness, and this story of Ukrainian artists trying to survive during the Russian occupation had an undeniable immediacy this season. How to Watch It: In theaters. After a stellar awards-season run, this one arguably came up short on Oscar nominations morning with nods in just two categories, but Kieran Culkin still eventually won Best Supporting Actor, and that’s not nothing. Nominated for Best International Feature Film The film also had a rich awards-season run before its Oscars night, including wins at the National Board of Review for International Film and for Best Director from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. This telling of the events at the Munich Olympics through the eyes of the newspeople covering it was a regular performer this season, mostly in editing, but it actually missed there for the Academy and dropped in a writing category. This excellent A24 drama tells the true story of prisoners changed by working on a theater production, and it’s building steam over the season, winning Best Actor for Colman Domingo from Gotham and getting multiple nominations for its star and the excellent supporting work from Clarence Maclin. It’s too bad it didn’t win an Oscar, but three nominations — and the film itself — are undeniably a major achievement. How to Watch It: Available to rent or own on demand; streaming on Max March 21. Was this the first Tyler Perry film to be nominated for an Oscar? This was not the kind of standard nonfiction film that the Academy usually nominates, telling the story of American musicians Abbey Lincoln and Max Roach as they protested the murder of Patrice Lumumba with a unique structure and visual language. How to Watch It: Kino Film Collection and on demand. A brave piece of filmmaking, this documentary pulled the curtain back on the Canadian Indian residential school system, speaking to survivors about the horrors they witnessed there. How to Watch It: Hulu and Disney+. Everyone’s favorite cheese-loving inventor and his trusty sidekick were away for far too long but came back in 2024 like an old friend. Arguably underperforming given how beloved it became, this Dreamworks and Universal gem still landed two nods.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Academy isn’t wasting any more time deciding: Conan O’Brien is coming back to host the Oscars for the second year in the row. In a joint statement, Academy CEO Bill Kramer and president Janet Yang said they are “thrilled” to bring O’Brien back, as well as returning executive producers Raj Kapoor and Katy Mullan and returning producers Jeff Ross and Mike Sweeney. “This year, they produced a hugely entertaining and visually stunning show that celebrated our nominees and the global film community in the most beautiful and impactful way,” the statement said. “Conan was the perfect host — skillfully guiding us through the evening with humor, warmth, and reverence. It is an honor to be working with them again.”

O’Brien didn’t bother reciprocating with any compliments about the Academy in his statement, instead opting to explain, “The only reason I’m hosting the Oscars next year is that I want to hear Adrien Brody finish his speech.” Whether we get a sequel to those record-breaking thank-yous or not, the 2026 Oscars will take place on March 15, 2026, and air live out of the Dolby Theatre on ABC at 7 p.m. ET. Conan, if you’re reading this, we’d like to remind you that there’s someone we’d like to see you bring onstage.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/black-bag-director-steven-soderberghs-secret-ingredient.html'>‘Black Bag’ Director Steven Soderbergh’s Secret Ingredient</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 07:00:11 <p>
Steven Soderbergh’s work ethic is so legendary that there’s a joke about it: “In the time it took me to say this, he made another movie.” This year is already shaping up to be a productivity all-timer. He’s released two films as director in seven weeks: the ghost story Presence, which opened in January, and Black Bag, an espionage drama about two married spies (Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender) that opened Friday. When I asked him a week ago what movie would be next, he said, “We just wrapped one on Thursday.” That would be The Christophers, “a dark comedy about the estranged children of a once-famous artist who hire a forger to complete his unfinished works so they can be discovered and sold after his death.” He hopes to premiere it this fall. In every project where he’s a hands-on filmmaker, he tries to create not just another IMDB credit but a challenge. He loves unconventional casting (he built The Girlfriend Experience around porn star Sasha Grey, Haywire around mixed martial artist Gina Carano, and Bubble around a group of Ohio factory workers) and lives to subvert genre expectations (Presence is a ghost story told from the point of view of a ghost, while Black Bag is a dialogue-driven spy thriller with almost no violence, focusing on a marriage). He was one of the earliest A-list filmmakers to embrace video over film (Full Frontal was his first, shot with a low-resolution “prosumer” camera) and he’s been a high-profile beta tester for new digital cameras ever since (his 2008 biopic Che was the first feature shot with the Red One camera, which immediately became an industry standard). Sometimes Soderbergh sets very tight parameters for production, mainly because he’s curious to see the result: every scene in Presence is done in one take, while his 2003 HBO political series K Street consists of 10 episodes that were conceived, shot, edited, and premiered within seven-day spans. It was great to come off something like Presence, in which the editing is restricted to stringing together single shots with a little bit of black in between, and return to a more editorially complex, montage-friendly story — and, in this case, sequences that required a really granular approach to the shots and the editing: two dinner-table scenes. I was saying to somebody the other day, no screenwriting class or book would advise you to put two 12-page dinner-table scenes in your script — and more than that! Which they are: I really had to think of them like that. And that meant they needed the same kind of visual attention and thought that you would give to a traditional action sequence. I thought that there had to be a way to keep this interesting for the audience and develop strategies visually so that there could be an escalation in each scene that matched the gear shifts indicated in the text, but not in a way that was distracting or annoying to the audience. The goal was to create versions of those dinner-table scenes that — contrary to what is typical when you talk about ten-to-12-page dialogue scenes — would make people immediately go, Can I watch that scene again? Your first feature, sex, lies and videotape had a number of very important scenes unfolding around tables. I’m still convinced this is where events begin. Big events, small events: two people in a room is usually how they start, and so I’m endlessly fascinated by it and not scared of it. He said, “Are you worried that the whole movie is just set in this hotel suite with this one character?” I said, “It’s not a problem for me.” I didn’t get the job, but the thing never got made, so … [Shrugs.] And of course you’ve done a filmed stage monologue, Spalding Gray’s Gray’s Anatomy, which was essentially that sort of movie. And while you’re trying to come up with ways to keep it from being predictable visually as you shoot it, you also have to be secure in the text and in the actors, because at the end of the day, if the script is good and you cast it properly, it should work, so you don’t want to overdo it and start creating visual tricks because you’re insecure that people are going to get bored. Soderbergh on set, directing a scene from Black Bag. Speaking of text: I wanted to talk to you about your collaborations with screenwriter David Koepp, with whom you’ve done four features. Like you, he seems to enjoy working in every genre. This one seems like a throwback to other films he’s been involved in, notably the first Mission: Impossible, though of course that was a very different kind of spy movie. He’d been noodling with this idea for a while, and we’d been talking about it for a while: making something like Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf. I kept harping on it and prodding him for years to essentially write his own version of that play. I wrote a 12-page dinner scene today.” And I said, “Well, God help the person who’s got to direct that.” And then, three months later, I was that person — and there were two dinner-table scenes! Before this interview I rewatched your 1996 experimental feature Schizopolis. In that movie, there are three principal actors, each of whom plays two characters. You’ve got doppelgängers all over the place in that movie, and tons of deception, and it reminded me that deception in your work is intertwined with performance and/or acting, whether the project is Black Bag, sex, lies and videotape, Schizopolis, Out of Sight, The Girlfriend Experience, The Informant! All of that made me think back to another one of our conversations, where you talked about what an important developmental milestone it was to become your own cinematographer, as well as camera operator, and dive into scenes with the cast. So I wonder: Isn’t every Steven Soderbergh movie Schizopolis? What you just said makes me think of two things. There’s been some contract, whether spoken or unspoken, and it’s been violated, and this is what is creating the drama. The other thing you’ve made me think of is the performative aspect of our lives — the fact that we all indulge, I think, in presenting a version of ourselves to the world that we want to align with our idea of ourselves. I do know this: The first family that lived in a cave, when they saw the second family that lived in a cave, started discussing why the other family’s cave was bigger. But at the same time, I think it’s very necessary for each of us to retain a part of ourselves that is just for ourselves and believe that there’s nothing inherently wrong with that. For instance, there’s no scenario in which I would ever snoop through my wife’s laptop, phone, journal, or what have you. I would never in a million years do that. You just made me think of the classic moment in The Limey when Luis Guzmán and Terence Stamp are at the party at Peter Fonda’s mansion, standing on a pool that extends out into a canyon like a precipice, and Stamp says, “What are we standing on?” and Guzmán says, “Trust.” There’s a line from the movie version of Graham Greene’s Fallen Idol where the kid asks Ralph Richardson why people lie, and he says, “Well, it’s because they want something and they think telling the truth won’t get it for them.” This is all around us! Even in a pandemic thriller like Contagion, trust is integral to the story, not just at an institutional level, but a personal one: If you think you might have a contagious disease, you’re supposed to tell somebody. It’s still happening, I think, with COVID, even though it’s now been kind of integrated into our lives five years after the start of the pandemic. I think most people now, when they start to feel something that feels like it might be COVID, are not immediately running out and getting COVID tests. A lot of them are telling themselves, Oh, it’s probably just a cold because confirming it’s COVID means they’d have to miss work and lose money. Once we started talking, language was the fuel that let us really start making shit up. I don’t know, but I do know this: The first family that lived in a cave, when they saw the second family that lived in a cave, started discussing why the other family’s cave was bigger. I’m very interested in the fact that we’re still unable to pinpoint the exact time when the part of our brain that creates and processes language came about, and why it came about. Was it diet related, because we started eating different things? We still don’t know exactly when this phase transition took place. I read somewhere that at some point, a couple hundred thousand years ago, a version of us emerged that’s more or less what we think of as “ourselves” now. I’m talking about the versions of humanoid creatures that would eventually turn into Homo sapiens: At one point it was determined, by tracing DNA back, that this group consisted of about 3,000 people. It’s ridiculous how small that number is. But I wonder, you know, is there another version of a renaissance in our thinking, in our behavior, to be had? We kind of tapped out in terms of our ability to improve ourselves and stop killing each other at an increasingly rapid clip. We clearly indulge, and have always indulged, in a fantasy that a new piece of technology is going to save us or provide a moment of transcendence, and it never works out that way. What ends up happening is we very rapidly figure out the worst possible use for a new piece of technology. Severus, the top-secret device that drives the action in Black Bag, is a perfect example of what you’re talking about. And it’s also kind of the MacGuffin of the movie — a Trojan horse for David to explore what he really wanted to explore, which is what happens if you are in a relationship in which part of the construct is a “Get Out of Jail Free” card that you can wield at any moment. The idea that in espionage, there are unsavory but officially sanctioned things, including having sex with a target to make your cover story convincing, that you can’t tell your partner about, and they have to be okay with it, and they also have to trust that when you engage in that kind of activity you’re “working,” as opposed to stepping out on your partner. Also interesting: There’s a successful marriage in this milieu, George and Kathryn. That fact is annoying to other people in their world, to such an extent that the happy couple becomes a target for being framed. I thought that it was fascinating that people in this world could be activated by their envy of that kind of relationship and moved to do some really unsavory things in order to sabotage it. Back to the idea of a betrayal as the inciting incident of a story: In the very first scene, George’s colleague Meachum (played by Gustaf Skarsgård) warns George that his wife might be part of a group of traitorous moles within the agency. This piece of information is delivered in a nightclub, a Dionysian space where the whole point is to lose your inhibitions. It used to open with George and Meachum on a bench near the Thames. But by the time we got to the wrap party for the shoot, I was already pitching David a different version of that opening scene that would feel a little less genteel, and that would also play directly to the theme of the movie: What if George has to go fish this guy out of a club where he shouldn’t be hanging out in order to get this information that he needs about a possible mole within the agency? It’s more interesting visually, and it does play right to the core of the movie, which is that this guy [Meachum] is really taking advantage of the lacuna that they’ve all agreed exists in these relationships.” A new opening like that is the result of being able to see scenes, and the movie itself, very, very quickly, either while we’re shooting or shortly after we finish shooting, so that I can immediately put into play anything that needs to be redone or any new material that needs to be shot. We ended up doing two days of additional photography — spread out over a couple months, because of actors’ schedules — to really go after story -clarification points, because in a movie like this, the way in which you release information to the audience is everything. If it’s too far away and feel like they can’t reach it at all, they get frustrated and tap out. And if they’re ahead of you, that’s a disaster, right? It was only through screening the film for people, whether it’s for friends or at two test screenings with strangers, that you can figure this stuff out, because it’s really hard to predict what information will land and what won’t. Luckily, you as a storyteller have your own “Get Out of Jail Free” card, which is: If the audience can see where the movie is going in a general sense, it’s okay, as long as they can’t predict the exact path. Yeah — it’s got to be that combination of surprising and inevitable, right? This is something that David’s very good at. I’m used to having, obviously, a fairly intimate relationship with my cast, because it’s me operating the camera. But Presence was next level in terms of my physical relationship to them. That’s how we’re learning what it wants. That’s one of the two questions you’re asking yourself while you’re watching the film: Who is it, and what does it want? I had a level of performance anxiety as the director and the camera operator that I’d never had before, because, given the professional skill set of the cast, if there was a take that was no good, it was because I made a mistake, not them. And that would happen, especially on some of the longer takes. The most common mistake was me predicting or anticipating movement on the part of an actor in a way that, if you didn’t actually know they were going to make that move, you would have reacted differently. I’m specifically talking about the lag time in a pan when an actor moves from one place to another. And be in the right spot before it happens? You once told me that a continuous, first-person viewpoint, which drives virtual reality experiences and a lot of videogames, is at cross-purposes with the idea of visual storytelling, because you need to understand how a character is reacting to events. How did you justify the continuous first-person in Presence, then? When I see first person [filming techniques], in which we’re aware that this perspective is supposed to represent a human being in the corporeal world that is seeing all this stuff, I feel like there’s a primal desire to see a reverse angle and look into the eyes of the character who’s experiencing the story. That’s a very strong impulse, and it’s why, whenever I watch material that’s done in that fashion, after a certain point I start to disengage, because I don’t feel connected to the lead character or characters who are experiencing the events. You didn’t have the desire to see a reverse angle of the character’s face, because you knew there was nothing there. You’ve got some very effective first person shots in your movies, but they never go unanswered by reverse shots of the character who’s doing the looking. In The Limey, which is about time and memory, you always give us closeups of Terence Stamp’s character so that we can see how he feels about whatever he’s remembering. David and I talked about this: there were only so many variations to this gimmick before you’ve got to let people know what’s happening. We really felt like if you added stuff to make it any longer, you would’ve had to start adding elements that would have felt inorganic. In a different way, the same was true for Black Bag. David and I talked about that, because in order for the movie to be any more complex, you’ve got to start adding another layer of plot, maybe some more characters. And neither of us felt like that was necessary or correct to do. Isn’t Traffic the longest, unless you count Che, which is really two films? It’s hard for me to imagine, at this point, making a movie that’s more than two hours long. I like the idea that if somebody wants to watch something I directed for a second time, there’ll never be the impediment of, “Oh, but it’s long!” Sometimes my wife and I have that conversation: If it’s a certain hour of the night and we think about watching something, we’re like, “Yeah, but it’s, like, two hours and 17 minutes. We’re not going to make it.” I would rather my work be on a list of movies that are, like, 96 minutes. I am increasingly attracted to things that are distilled.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/the-righteous-gemstones-recap-season-4-episode-2.html'>The Righteous Gemstones Recap: Wasting Away in Margaritaville</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 02:43:49 <p>
There’s no better song choice to close this emotionally turbulent and spectacularly vulgar episode than Pet Shop Boys’ “It’s a Sin,” a synth-pop classic from 1987 that at once serves the disco-era grotesquerie of the Aimee-Leigh Give-A-Thon inside the Gemstone megachurch and underlines Eli Gemstone’s late-life urge to sow his wild oats. Though Pet Shop Boys singer Neil Tennant had not yet come out of the closet in 1987, “It’s a Sin” references the shame-based repression of his Catholic-school education: “For everything I long to do / No matter when or where or who / Has one thing in common, too.” Then comes the chorus. It’s funny to think about any kind of repression being an issue in the Gemstone family, which generally allows itself to indulge in the sins (and the language) it condemns on Sundays, but when considering the idea of their father taking up with another woman, Jesse, Kelvin, and Judy are as grossed out as they would have been as schoolchildren. “Could you even imagine if Daddy met someone new?” says Kelvin. “Yucky ducks!” Even though the children find plenty of evidence that their dad has been drinking and carousing on a boat in the Florida Keys, the thought of Eli taking up with someone other than their dead mother is so impossible that they accept his explanation that he uses a bra to catch fish. Eli is indeed wasting away in Margaritaville, doing his own variation on the South Florida cliché of a divorced or widowed gray-hair tomcatting around the marina. For one, it’s not really a one-night stand: The two have been seeing each other for long enough for his lover to want something more from their relationship, suggesting that Eli needed a few dates to justify the sin most men in his situation would commit after a single boozy night at the cantina. He’s even enough of a gentleman to break it off with her gently, frying up a couple of sunny-side-up eggs to see her off in the morning. It’s a torment for him to admit he doesn’t like her. They just need him to come back for the telethon for their mom, because the church needs as many revenue streams open as possible without him around. The fact that they’re even producing this splashy telethon around their dead mother is a sign that the Gemstone business still has to lean heavily on its past because Eli’s unholy trinity of failchildren are having trouble holding the congregation on their own. Kelvin and Keefe are thrilled by the early returns for Prism, an effort to broaden Kelvin’s hip youth pastor schtick into a more inclusive place for Christians. Keefe presses for Kelvin to make their relationship more public and even suggests getting married, but Kelvin wants to dance a two-step where everyone probably knows about their relationship but they aren’t up front about it. He likens their partnership to Siegfried and Roy in that audiences knew “they were licking each other’s wieners” but wouldn’t stick around for the white tigers if they made it explicit. For his part, Jesse and his family are out hawking high-tech worship kiosks called Prayer Pods for people who want a space at the mall or the airport to access Gemstone sermons and hymns (and episodes of Bible Bonkers) at times of spiritual need, like when they’re waiting for their wives to finish shopping. It also brings a visitor in Lori Milsap, Aimee’s best friend, played by Megan Mullally, an actress whose brassiness on comedies like Party Down and Parks and Recreation fits in perfectly here. Having discounted their father’s libido earlier, the kids don’t notice that Eli and Lori have a connection, and their old man still has enough game to follow through on it. As lowbrow laughs go, there’s nothing funnier than full-frontal male nudity, and there’s certainly no funnier moment than Baby Billy dropping his drawers in front of the Gemstones in the dressing room after their rehearsal goes awry. After witnessing the spectacle of BJ doing a core-strength workout on the stripper pole, she unleashes her carnal desires: “Watching you work that pole’s got me slick, boy. • Jesse’s resentment over his father becoming a mentor figure for Gideon comes out in typically childlike form: “Go be butt buddies with your granddaddy.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

[Editor’s note: This review contains spoilers for “The White Lotus” Season 3, Episode 5, “Full Moon Party.”] In “The White Lotus” Season 3, Episode 5, Lochlan (Sam Nivola) poses an existential question to brother Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger): What if this life is all a trial, a chance to become better people? Because if life is a test, he’s not only expecting but hoping to fail. Despite all the fronting, Saxon isn’t taken seriously by most of his nuclear family, which probably extends to a lot of people elsewhere in his life. His attachment to Lochy is entirely contingent upon the younger brother hanging on his every word and twisted idea — or at least putting on a convincing show of it. Lochlan’s “One day, I’m gonna take you down” is so disquieting, dismissed no sooner than it’s uttered, but definitely worth noting. He plays the baby brother card strategically, and no one ever suspects him. When he takes the drugs, he follows up by telling Saxon, “Don’t be mad.” Not “Please don’t be mad,” and not a question: a statement. Whether this came from Schwarzenegger or White, it’s masterful. He’s rightfully uncomfortable when Lochlan kisses him later, but Saxon has been projecting some weird sexual shit on his siblings this entire time. Somewhere off the White Lotus property, Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan), Laurie (Carrie Coon), and Kate (Leslie Bibb) are having a night to remember (or to forget, if I counted right). When she thinks the girls at the club recognize and are whispering about her, she responds by dancing even more suggestively (with a man who it turns out they know). This is just a blip of bedlam to tease what she gets into back at the villa, sleeping with Valentin (Arnas Fedaravicius) after constantly nudging Laurie toward him — including just a few minutes prior, when he and his friends left! Jaclyn is on her solitary sojourn into mayhem, while Kate maybe gets a reality check that she doesn’t want this. Just look at that light in Coon’s eyes when Jaclyn says, “You guys look amazing!” This woman has been begging for a compliment since Episode 1! There’s unease in every shot, cut, and beat of music. Cinematographer Ben Kutchins catches a chilling glimpse of Laurie’s top floating forgotten through the pool water. But the episode ends with Timothy (Jason Isaacs) in more danger than anyone else. If the next few episodes are a prolonged journey to his suicide, I will be having words with White. Most sus: Greg (Jon Gries) was not in this episode, so we’ll go with Jaclyn for obsessing over Laurie and Valentin and then sleeping with him herself. Best line reading: Rothwell for “I mean, he killed his wife.” Since this is a new one, honorable mentions from previous weeks include “How wonderful for you, how wonderful for you,” (Morgana O’Reilly as Pam), “Whatchu dreamin’ bout, Pornchai?” (Rothwell again), and “Sawadee never” from the one and only Walton Goggins.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

11:58 AM PT -- Drake's lead attorney Mike Gottlieb tells TMZ ... “UMG wants to pretend that this is about a rap battle in order to distract its shareholders, artists and the public from a simple truth: a greedy company is finally being held responsible for profiting from dangerous misinformation that has already resulted in multiple acts of violence. This motion is a desperate ploy by UMG to avoid accountability, but we have every confidence that this case will proceed and continue to uncover UMG’s long history of endangering, abusing and taking advantage of its artists.” Drake's trying to have his cake and eat it too ... according to his music label UMG, which says his whole lawsuit over "Not Like Us" is really just sour grapes because Kendrick Lamar buried him in their rap beef. Universal Music Group filed docs Monday in federal court, calling out Drake for his part in the diss track battle that surrounded the release of "Not Like Us." For example, when he felt that Lamar was taking too long to respond, Drake released a second recording in which he goaded Lamar to continue the public rap battle." Remember, Drake is suing his label for releasing the track, claiming it did so knowing its "certified pedophile" line was false and defamatory. But, in the docs, obtained by TMZ Hip Hop, UMG points out both Drake and Lamar released a total of 9 blistering songs attacking each other -- and, "Drake has been pleased to use UMG's platform to promote tracks leveling similarly incendiary attacks at Lamar." UMG says Drake's insults included claims Kendrick is a domestic abuser, and Kendrick's biz partner is the real father of the rapper's son. Translation: Ya live by the sword, ya die by the sword, Drake! UMG flat-out denies "Not Like Us" is defamatory, especially considering the context of the rap war that was raging between both rappers -- who are both UMG artists -- and, it wants a judge to dismiss the whole lawsuit.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Kim Kardashian is mulling over a big decision ... whether to go to court and ask a judge to strip Kanye West of joint legal custody of their 4 kids, because her ex-husband has flagrantly ignored their custody agreement. The latest legal war was set off after Kanye agreed in a mediation Friday not to release a previously recorded song in which their daughter North raps. The track -- "Lonely Roads Still Go to Sunshine" -- also includes a phone convo between Diddy and Kanye. Thing is ... Kim was vehemently opposed to letting North participate in any way ... and according to their divorce settlement, they both have equal say in making decisions for their kids. Sources with direct knowledge tell TMZ, the divorce settlement provides for the event there's a conflict -- Kim and Kanye must first go to a private judge to try and hash out an agreement. Kim was there for the mediation with her lawyer, Disso Queen Laura Wasser, and his lawyer, Patrick DeCarolis, and they did reach an agreement ... North would not appear on any version of the song if it was released. But agreements don't seem to matter with Kanye, and he released the song with North's voice over the weekend. One recent exception ... when Kanye held an event where he urged participants to wear swastika shirts. She did not feel it was appropriate for her kids to attend that event.

Our law enforcement sources provided new details about the circumstances surrounding his death. We're told Philip Enewally, better known by his YouTube name, collapsed on the ground in front of mailboxes at his L.A. apartment building Friday afternoon.

Our sources say the property manager discovered P2istheName and phoned 911, prompting police and paramedics to respond.

We're told paramedics performed life-saving measures on P2istheName, but they ultimately couldn't revive him and he was pronounced dead at the scene.

We're also told there were no immediate signs of drugs or alcohol ... and, as of now, his death is being treated as from natural causes.

Our sources say the L.A. County Coroner has conducted an autopsy and is awaiting toxicology results.

As you may know ... P2istheName rose to prominence after posting NBA 2K and Fortnite gaming videos, before moving to more general video game content. He posted lots of "Let's Plays" -- walk-throughs of popular video games -- and went on to start his own clothing line, WallyCo.

Cops in Florida say a man stole an ambulance and led law enforcement on a wild car chase through the streets of Tampa ... finishing a can of beer before being dragged out of the driver's seat and thrown in handcuffs ... and it's all on video.

TMZ obtained dashcam footage from Saturday's police pursuit ... and it shows Florida Highway Patrol Troopers pursuing the ambulance as the emergency vehicle runs stop signs, swerves through traffic, drives on the wrong side of the road and nearly crashes into motorists.

When the driver finally pulls over, you see him down a canned drink -- cops say it was a beer -- before officers open the door and throw him to the ground.

We're told the pursuit started around 8:40 PM Saturday after Florida Highway Patrol says they got an alert about a Tampa Fire Rescue ambulance being stolen from HCA South Tampa Hospital.

Police say troopers found the ambulance about 10 minutes after the call came in, and attempted a traffic stop ... but the driver fled in the ambulance.

The U.S. hunting influencer at the center of the #WombatGate mess issued an apology -- but it fell on deaf ears when she went off on the Australian government, calling them hypocrites for letting thousands of animals get killed every year.

Samantha Strable -- AKA Sam Jones on IG -- left the hosts of Australia’s Channel 10 fuming when she bailed on a scheduled interview. Instead, she sent them a pre-recorded video statement, in which she said she regretted pulling the baby wombat away from its mother in the original video last week.

After briefly owning up to her actions, Sam directed people's attention to the government of the nation widely condemning her, claiming officials are funneling millions of Aussie tax dollars into the mass slaughter of native animals.

She slammed the hypocrisy as staggering, saying that while she regrets what she did on video, she refuses to be a scapegoat for a "far greater, far more uncomfortable reality."

Her apology didn’t sit well with the hosts at all -- they called it pathetic and vented it was cowardly to point fingers at the Australian government while hiding behind a pre-recorded video instead of facing them live.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The pair were practically glued together for SKIMS' Wedding Shop shoot, giving them a little preview of what their own wedding night might look like, even though their official wedding date is still TBD.

Abby made it crystal clear she wasn’t just modeling the pieces, revealing she’ll be wearing them for her own wedding and honeymoon -- and Patrick was all in on the collection too, especially with designs for the often-overlooked groom.

Of course, Kim’s a genius -- slyly cashing in on Patrick’s "White Lotus" fame for her big campaign ... where she said their love shone through every shot.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Luigi Mangione says the cops who arrested him at a Pennsylvania McDonald's got a DNA sample with a little trickery ... by offering him a snack.

The accused murderer's legal team is now arguing police violated Luigi's rights when they arrested and questioned him ... and he wants the evidence they collected thrown out ... according to new court documents.

In the docs, obtained by TMZ, Luigi says cops pulled a fast one on him after arresting him at McDonald's in Altoona, PA ... giving him some food and soda at the police station as a means of getting a sample of his DNA.

Luigi's lawyer says the DNA samples are "poisonous fruits" obtained from an illegal search.

What's more, Luigi claims the cops who first approached him at the Golden Arches did not have proper legal justification to detain him ... and he says the officers illegally seized his bag and removed a notebook with his so-called "manifesto" as a way to sway public opinion against him.

Luigi's legal team is asking the court to exclude the evidence police obtained during their search. The documents were filed in his state case in Pennsylvania, where he's charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery, and providing false identification to police.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

He also chaired the committee that put them in. North Carolina was one of a few teams “on the bubble” heading into Sunday night’s selection show. When the final conference title games had ended on Sunday, ESPN’s bracket expert had UNC on the outside looking in. 11 seed San Diego State in the First Four on Tuesday. For having a team make the field, North Carolina’s AD will receive one twelfth of his annual base salary, which is $814,868, according to his contract. That process includes a stated policy of having the AD of any school (or commissioner) leave the room when his or her teams are being discussed, and to abstain from any voting. In a televised interview Sunday night on CBS, Cunningham said he recused himself for all discussions involving the Tar Heels. “But all the policies and procedures were followed and Keith can address exactly how North Carolina was discussed because I was not in the room for any of that.” West Virginia governor Patrick Morrisey, who said Monday that he would consider legal action against the NCAA over WVU’s exclusion from the tournament, hinted at Cunningham’s conflict of interest. A representative for the NCAA didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on whether committee members are compensated. The 12-person committee is a mix of conference commissioners and athletic directors. The only others whose teams received at-large bids were Alabama AD Greg Byrne and West Coast Conference commissioner Stu Jackson. Cunningham’s five-year deal, signed in 2022, pays him $814,868 per year with a hefty amount of additional compensation, including a $110,409 retention bonus every three months. UNC head coach Hubert Davis also received a bonus for making the tournament. According to his contract, which started last July, he will receive $100,000 for playing in Tuesday’s game.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
