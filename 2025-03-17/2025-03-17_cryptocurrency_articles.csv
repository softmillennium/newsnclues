Still, a crypto whale has taken a contrarian stance by raising a leveraged bearish bet on BTC worth millions on Hyperliquid while betting bullish on the MELANIA token.

As of writing, the whale held a short position in BTC perpetual futures worth over $445 million, generating an unrealized gain of $1.3 million. The position employed a 40x leverage and a liquidation price of $86,000, according to data source Hyperliquid and Lookonchain.

The outsized short anticipating a bitcoin price slide made waves on social media X on Sunday as pseudonymous trader CBB invited other market participants for a consortium of bulls aimed at liquidating the whale.

""11 hours ago, @Cbb0fe publicly formed a team to hunt this whale who shorted $BTC with 40x leverage. Just one hour later, the team was in action, driving $BTC above $84,690 in a short period,"" blockchain sleuth Lookonchain said on X.

""The whale was forced to deposit $5M USDC to increase margin and avoid liquidation. But the hunt ultimately failed,"" Lookonchain added.

As of writing, the crypto whale also held a 5x leveraged long position in the MELANIA perpetual futures, anticipating a price rise in the memecoin reportedly marketed by MKT World LLC, a Florida-registered company owned by Melania Trump, the wife of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Hyperliquid cheered the whole episode on X, saying the transparency of trading positions on its platform has redefined trading.

""When a whale shorts $450M+ BTC and wants a public audience, it's only possible on Hyperliquid. When headlines say ""Bitcoin Market on Edge,"" they are equating ""Hyperliquid"" with the ""market."" Anyone can photoshop a PNL screenshot. No one can question a Hyperliquid position, just like no one can question a Bitcoin balance. The decentralized future is here,"" Hyperliquid said.

The platform was in the news last week after an influential whale executed the so-called ""liquidation arbitrage"" by extracting floating profits, leading to a margin shortage. That induced liquidation and transferred the risk to the decentralized exchange's HLP vault.",coindesk

BTC prices quickly rose from $70K to above $80K in early November after pro crypto Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. As a result, very little BTC changed hands between those levels, leaving a so-called ""supply gap,"" as evident from Glassnode's UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) chart.

This metric tracks the price points at which existing bitcoin UTXOs were last moved. Each bar represents the volume of bitcoin that last changed hands within a specific price range. The data is entity-adjusted, meaning it assigns an average purchase price for each entity, categorizing its full balance accordingly.

Bitcoin's rapid surge from the mid-$60K to over $100K following Donald Trump's U.S. election victory left little supply accumulation in the $70K to $80K range, as it traded only for a few days between these levels.

In other words, the total number of traders with acquisition prices between $70K and $80K is likely to be far less than at other levels. So, a move below $80K will likely see very little bargain hunting from holders looking to buy more at their acquisition costs, thus ensuring little support before $73K, the all time high set in March 2024.

Besides, as bitcoin currently consolidates above $80K, approximately 20% of the total supply is currently at a loss—meaning these holdings were purchased above the current price of $83K. These wallets could add to the selling pressure below $80K, leading to a quick slide.

Glassnode data shows that approximately 100,000 BTC have been sold by short-term holders due to the price correction. While the lack of supply and current tepid demand has already contributed to bitcoin’s 30% pullback from its all-time high of $108K.",coindesk

The primary deterrent for the BOK is bitcoin's notorious price instability, where the central bank fears that the wild swings in the crypto market could substantially inflate transaction costs when converting bitcoin to cash, posing a significant risk to its reserves.

The BOK further pointed out that bitcoin fails to meet the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) foreign exchange reserve management standards. The IMF emphasizes the importance of prudently managing liquidity, market, and credit risks — criteria that bitcoin, with its erratic nature, does not satisfy.

However, maintaining a sustained uptick could still be a challenge, especially since President Donald Trump's administration appears to have a higher tolerance for market instability than many expected. Just two months ago, when Trump took office, the crypto market was buzzing with optimism that any turbulence created by tariffs would lead to prompt policy support from the White House.

That optimism seems to have been misplaced. Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said corrections are healthy and normal, a hint that the anticipated ""Trump put"" might take longer to materialize than traders hoped.

More importantly, on NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, Bessent did not rule out the possibility of a recession. This starkly contrasts with government officials' typical attitude of emphasizing ""glass half full"" perspective when the going gets tough.

It could mean Trump isn't ready to back down from his tariff fight just yet, keeping risk assets feeling uneasy. If stock prices continue to fall, it's hard to imagine bitcoin staying resilient for long, especially given the lack of uplifting narratives in the crypto market.

""It's just a guess, but I doubt Trump will reverse course on tariffs and his drive to bring U.S. manufacturing back at these price levels,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, shared in an email. ""I can’t picture a scenario where risk assets crash and crypto remains unaffected, or where the VIX increases and crypto's implied volatility doesn’t follow suit.""

Plus, sentiment is deteriorating on Main Street, which could add to the recent risk aversion in both the crypto and traditional markets. A chart shared on X by Otavio Costa, a macro strategist at Crescat's Capital, highlights a record number of U.S. consumers expecting conditions to worsen over the next year (see Chart of the Day, below).

The focus on macro means traders will follow Wednesday's Fed meeting for cues on the central bank's readiness to deploy stimulus. The bar is low after Chairman Powell said the bank is in a wait-and-watch mode to assess the impact of Trump's policies before cutting rates.

In other news, Aave Labs's Founder, Stani Kulechov, confirmed that the Aave decentralized autonomous organization had reached a clear consensus against introducing a new token for Horizon, an Aave initiative to integrate real-world assets into decentralized finance.

BNB Chain trading volumes flipped those of Ethereum and Solana over weekend.

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) built on BNB Chain racked up over $1.7 billion in trading volume in each of the past three days as newer memecoins created trading opportunities for traders.

The PancakeSwap DEX processed over $1.2 billion of volume in the past 24 hours, helping to boost CAKE token prices by 30%.

The Mubarak (MUBARAK) memecoin emerged as the token gaining the most attention on X, gaining listings on platforms like Binance Alpha and exchanges such as Bitget on Monday.

It was introduced through the BNB Chain-based Four Meme launchpad on March 13, with an initial market cap as low as $6,000. That soared past $100 million on Sunday. The coin has no inherent utility beyond its meme-driven appeal, typical of many tokens in this category, relying instead on community engagement and speculative trading.

Data from DEXTools shows brisk token issuance activity on BNB Chain as of European morning hours Monday, although most new launches fail to break a $10,000 market capitalization or fall to zero as their creators pull liquidity from trading pools.

Meanwhile, BNB Chain's BNB has gained 5% in the past 24 hours amid the renewed demand, beating a broader market fall.

The bitcoin-gold ratio has collapsed to levels last seen in early November. The slide has penetrated the ratio's March 2024 high, flipping it into a resistance level.

The 50-day SMA has peaked and is also trending south, looking to move below the 200-day SMA in a so-called death cross. That would signal a prolonged gold outperformance relative to bitcoin.

""I’ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy, they are normal,” Bessent said Sunday on NBC’s Meet The Press, according to Bloomberg. “I‘m not worried about the markets. Over the long term, if we put good tax policy in place, deregulation and energy security, the markets will do great.”

Bessent's comment contradicts popular belief that the Trump administration will quickly douse any fire stemming from the administration's policy moves, particularly trade tariffs. President Donald Trump also recently clarified his stance, saying he is not looking at the stock market.

Wall Street's tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 entered correction last week, falling over 10% from their February highs predominantly on concerns that Trump's tariffs could slow economic growth while leading to sticky inflation.

Bitcoin (BTC), too, has taken a beating, down nearly 25% from the record highs above $109K in January, according to CoinDesk Indices data, tracking the risk-off on Wall Street and digesting disappointment over the absence of fresh BTC purchases under Trump's strategic digital assets reserve plan.

The risk-off has revved up expectations of policy support from the government or the Federal Reserve (Fed), particularly in the crypto community.

However, Bessent's take suggests that it may take longer to manifest or require more significant market declines before any action is taken. The Treasury secretary said last month that the Trump administration is focused on lowering the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which influences most long-term loans in the economy.

Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues stressed early this month that they are watching to see the “net effects” of Trump's policies on the economy and are not in a hurry to cut rates.

Officials will meet for a rate review this week, with the decision due Wednesday.

Now, it and other memecoins are being proposed as assets for a new slew of cryptocurrency ETFs. In just over a month, the U.S. crypto market went from facing an absurd amount of obstruction to an absurd amount of, well, absurdity.

While I can scarcely imagine a financial advisor telling me, “You’re slightly under-allocated in $TRUMP coin,” the reality is that these new currencies could be valid assets for an ETF. Another view is that they are completely useless.

A more generous view is that they are a form of creative expression. They’re not a symphony by Mozart, sure, but these coins — $BONK, $PENGU — clearly have some cultural value. I can see why some investors, retail and otherwise, would be interested in an ETF of this kind.

This brings us to Solana, which is now essentially the 3rd largest asset in terms of market cap and by far the largest in terms of network usage. Bitcoin, while initially envisioned as a kind of digital cash, has emerged as a digital store of value. And Solana has taken the mantle of a blockchain smart contract with its unique Proof of History having the potential to power all kinds of blockchain based applications. It’s time for a Solana ETF.

Read more: ‘It’s So Early’: How Solana Is Competing With Ethereum for Institutional Interest

The groundwork is there. It took 10 long years and a lawsuit for the Bitcoin ETF to be approved. After more challenges, an Ethereum ETF was also approved — with an asterisk. Every issuer that included providing “staking” rewards in their applications had to strike it. By doing so, the SEC effectively said that the issuers (and the investors) couldn’t participate in the governance of these blockchains, but could invest in them.

As a result, every investor who has bought into an Ethereum ETF since last May has missed the opportunity to earn yield on their asset — yield that comes directly from supporting the security of the blockchain itself. If, instead of ETF shares, these investors bought the same amount of Ethereum and staked it (for example, with Coinbase), they could earn, say, 2-4% APY, in return for letting their ETH be used to keep the blockchain secure. Whatever your politics, and however you feel about cryptocurrencies, the truth is that this puts American investors at a disadvantage. European investors already have ETPs for other currencies, and they also have access to staking rewards through them, too.

And yet, in the U.S., we are still waiting for a Solana ETF of any kind. And it certainly will not include staking to begin with, as the issuers learned from the Ethereum case not to include it. In my view, Europe’s approval of the staking ETPs should set the precedent for a staking ETF in the United States.

As for why that staking ETF should be for Solana, well — the fact that the president’s memecoin was released on Solana is no accident. It is a popular blockchain that can handle billions in transaction volume, even when it is unexpected. Its scalability and power will inevitably be applied to real-world assets in tradfi, and any other number of real-world use cases. Not giving investors access to invest in this technology through their traditional financial accounts is like if we limited investors to invest in Amazon or Google during their initial offerings. This is why a Solana ETF should be quickly approved: to give the broad retail and institutional investors access to the next biggest asset after Bitcoin and Ethereum.

In short: Solana is overdue for an ETF of its own, and I urge the new leadership at the SEC to approve the applications they have inherited from those including Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Bitwise - and even encourage them reintegrate staking rewards into their proposals. (Canary’s application has reached a second stage of SEC review, indicating it could be approved in due course.)

It is still early, so we are yet to see the long term impacts of this administration’s approach to cryptocurrency. But it’s possible that it could push through a new, better framework for crypto-asset products. That would be worth the hype.",coindesk

The company's prediction markets hub will allow customers to bet on event outcomes, the HOOD announced in a press release.

It's another competitor to Polymarket, the world’s largest predictions market, which exploded in popularity last year amid the U.S. presidential election and any number of other high- and lower-profile news events. The rise in popularity triggered intense scrutiny over the platform, which according to an analysis by NBC News, attracted over $3.6 billion in bets just for the presidential election.

Some questioned the identities behind the bets and whether results on the platform may have even swayed the election result in a certain direction. Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan’s New York City apartment was even raided by the FBI, who seized his phone and other electronic devices.

Robinhood said that it has been speaking with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in recent weeks.

“We believe in the power of prediction markets and think they play an important role at the intersection of news, economics, politics, sports, and culture,” said JB Mackenzie, VP & GM of Futures and International at Robinhood.

To kick off the product launch, traders will be able to bet on the potential upper bound of the target fed funds rate in May, as well as the upcoming men’s and women’s College Basketball Tournaments, Robinhood said.

JPMorgan noted that U.S.-listed miners maintained their share of the network hashrate at around 30%.

The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.

The ""average bitcoin price declined ~10%, pressuring mining economics in the period,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote.

The hashprice, a measure of daily mining profitability, was broadly unchanged from the end of last month, the report noted.

Miners earned roughly $48,300 in daily block reward revenue per EH/s in the first two weeks of March, a 11% drop from February, and a 52% decline since last April's halving event, the bank said.

The total market cap of the 14 U.S.-listed miners that the bank tracks slipped 13%, or about $3 billion, from the month previous.

Argo Blockchain (ARGO) outperformed with a 1% gain, while Cipher Mining underperformed with a 25% decline. Only one of the miners in the bank's coverage outperformed bitcoin in the same period, the report added.

Ethena, which offers a yield-bearing USDe token as well as a BUIDL-backed USDtb stablecoin, will migrate its $6 billion DeFi ecosystem to Converge, while Securitize, the transfer agent for BlackRock’s BUIDL token, will bring its suite of tokenized real world assets (RWAs), like the recently-issued Apollo credit fund token, to the new chain.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto Daybook Americas Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

From in the early days of DeFi there has been a concerted effort to expand beyond cryptocurrencies and bring traditional assets on chain as collateral. Today, traditional financial firms are clamouring to get in the tokenization race, so it makes sense for firms like Securitize and Ethena to create an institutional-friendly path to DeFi.

“Tokenization, per se, is just putting your securities on a different ledger, and it produces cost savings and efficiencies, but it doesn't necessarily lead to anything significantly different in terms of what you can do with these assets,” said Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo in an interview. “On the other hand, crypto has been developing very novel ways of using digital assets. If you could actually bring that DeFi innovation back into the RWA space it could make it explode.”

Securitize and Ethena have brought a sturdy firm of initial partners to Converge, including Pendle, Avara (the parent company of Aave Labs), Ethereal, Morpho, and Maple Finance. Custodial services will be provided by Copper, Fireblocks, Komainu, and Zodia, while interoperability will come via LayerZero, Wormhole and oracle support from RedStone.

Looking ahead to what can be built using the Converge blockchain, Ethena founder Guy Young said there will be new products courtesy of Securitize to be housed on the chain, opening up new use cases.

“That might be using this stuff as collateral within tailor-made money markets, or it could be trading of different assets which don't exist on-chain now at real scale, so that might be equities or whatever, going forward,” Young said in an interview. “We think something that's purpose built for this intersection of TradFi and Defi is going to be one of the largest opportunities over the next few years.”

Converge will be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling it to run Ethereum-based smart contracts, dApps, and tools without modification. It will boast performance that is in line with industry-leading blockchains, according to a press release.

Ethena’s native governance token, ENA, will serve as a stakeable asset (via sENA) for Converge, securing the network with a permissioned validator set composed of traditional finance entities and centralized exchanges. Both USDe and USDtb will serve as gas tokens for the network.

Converge is a public open chain with a kind of know-your-customer (KYC) wrapper, which goes beyond mere whitelisting of wallets, Domingo said.

“DeFi today is designed specifically for permissionless and anonymous market participants and freely transactable assets,” Domingo said. “To bring that innovation in a context where the collateral and the asset that you're pledging into the protocol is actually a regulated instrument, there are a bunch of things beyond purely white listing wallets and KYC.”

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

Pectra will go live on Hoodi on March 26, and if all goes well, the long-awaited upgrade will proceed to Etheruem's mainnet roughly 30 days later, according to the network's core developers.

Hoodi was created following faulty Pectra tests on Ethereum’s other testnets, Holesky and Sepolia, which failed to finalize properly due to problems with how they were configured.

Test networks like Holesky, Sepolia, and Hoodi aim to mimic the main Ethereum network — allowing developers the opportunity to test out code changes or major upgrades like Pectra in a low-stakes environment before deploying them to the mainnet.

Originally, the Pectra upgrade would have been activated on Ethereum following those two earlier tests. Because they didn't go smoothly, developers decided to build Hoodi to test the ambitious Pectra upgrade one more time, although the testnet can also be used for future tests.

Hoodi is designed to mimic Ethereum’s mainnet, with the same number of validators on its network. Ethereum core developer Parithosh Jayanthi argued during last week’s Ethereum core developers call that Hoodi would therefore be the testnet for Ethereum staking pools and node operators to test their infrastructure.

Holesky and Sepolia were built for different purposes: Holesky has a bigger validator set than Ethereum’s mainnet, which is supposed to help test out scalability problems, while Sepolia is a closed network just for developers, meant for testing out applications.

Pectra contains a series of upgrades designed to make Ethereum more user-friendly and efficient for developers and end-users. One of the biggest changes includes adding ""smart contract"" capabilities that could give wallets new features, like the ability to pay gas fees in cryptocurrencies other than ether (ETH).

“Razer ID verified by World ID” is a single sign-on mechanism that will verify real human gamers from bots. It's built atop Razer ID, Razer's existing login service, and will help guarantee there's ""a real person behind every Razer ID account,” according to a statement shared by Razer and World.

The collaboration between the two firms comes as artificial intelligence (AI) tools are seeping into every corner of online life — including inside of video games, which have been plagued by non-human AI ""bots"" since long before the rise of Altman's ChatGPT.

According to a study from Echelon Insights that World shared with CoinDesk, roughly 59% of gamers said that they regularly encountered unauthorized, third-party bots in their games. In addition to posing a general nuisance to players, bot accounts often have tactical advantages over real players, which can ruin the competitiveness of some multiplayer games.

“Game developers now have a tool to build dynamic spaces where real players —not bots— dominate the digital landscape,” World said in its statement.

Razer's integration with World Network builds upon World's existing blockchain-based identity solution, which uses iris scans to differentiate real humans from robots online.

The new feature will be integrated first into “TOKYO BEAST,” a blockchain-based game set in a version of Tokyo based 100 years in the future. It's an apt pairing: the game's main premise involves humans coexisting with autonomous androids.

When users log into TOKYO BEAST, they will be prompted to sign in using a World-authenticated Razer ID, ensuring they can play online with real human players only.

“As AI continues to reshape the gaming world, we want to empower gamers and game developers with the tools they need to navigate this transformation safely and confidently,” said Wei-Pin Choo, the chief corporate officer at Razer. “By teaming up with World, we’re ensuring that real players are the heart of every experience, keeping gaming fair, immersive, and designed for humans.”

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

BIPs are the formal method for discussion of proposed changes to Bitcoin. Theoretically, if a BIP gains sufficient widespread support, it will be added to Bitcoin, by way of a soft fork or a routine update to Bitcoin Core. Often, these BIPs are referred to by nicknames and multiple proposals may be included in a soft fork. BIP 119 refers to OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (CTV) while BIP 348 refers to OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK (CSFS).

This article first appeared on Blockspace Media, the leading Bitcoin industry publication dedicated to covering Bitcoin tech, markets, mining, and ordinals. Get Blockspace articles directly in your inbox by clicking here.

Bitcoin’s technical community typically debates these BIPs exhaustively. The Taproot Wizards–a Bitcoin development firm most well known for its Bitcoin NFTs–put out a helpful graphic explaining the confusing and seemingly circular process of these discussions.

In short, the Bitcoin soft fork process requires a rough estimate of support from Bitcoin’s stakeholders, including developers, custodians, investors and miners. The best proxy for this stakeholder support remains Bitcoin miners, who can flag support for an alteration to the codebase by signaling for changes in their mined blocks. Typically, Bitcoin Core asks for 95% of blocks over a period to signal for the change before locking in the update for activation.

Still, there’s no definitive heuristic for defining what “widespread support” looks like, and Bitcoin consensus is a constantly evolving, moving target. Miners are useful for signalling a change only because they are a truly ‘countable’ entity on the Bitcoin network. In other words, it’s difficult to get a say of meat world consensus given Bitcoin’s decentralized structure.

Over the course of February and March, we’ve registered a definite shift as numerous developers gave their explicit support for the two BIPs.

What’s in a proposal?

Over the course of the last few weeks, numerous Western Bitcoin developers tweeted their support for CTV and CSFS – a strong signal that at least the Twitterverse is coming together in favor of certain changes to Bitcoin.

CTV and CSFS allow new ways of writing Bitcoin script. Bitcoin script is Bitcoin’s lower-level programming language used for, among other things, creating and sending transactions. Proposed by former Bitcoin core contributor Jeremy Rubin, CTV has been around for more than half a decade, whereas CSFS was only formalized in November 2024 by Jeremy Rubin and Brandon Black.

These two BIPs would enable “covenants” on Bitcoin. A covenant simply restricts the way a wallet can spend bitcoin in future transactions. Covenants are generally expected to significantly improve the landscape for Bitcoin self-custody, fee management, and enhance existing Bitcoin tech like Lightning, Ark, and contract-based applications.

Additionally, developers consider these two proposals to be “narrowly defined.” In layman's terms, this means, if they are activated, there is a low probability of users exploiting them for something unexpected. The Bitcoin developer community tends to cautiously deliberate any changes to Bitcoin. For example, even though BIP 119 has remained unchanged for nearly half a decade, there was once a time not long ago when CTV was considered far too aggressive for activation.

A long time coming

You may remember that Rubin’s previous campaign for CTV received strong pushback – notably from Bitcoiners with large followings, including Adam Back and Jimmy Song. The criticisms evolved into significant pushback from many in the bitcoin community, finally leading to Rubin taking a step back from Bitcoin all together.

So what changed? Recent advocacy for the OP_CAT opcode (BIP 347) seems to have widened the Overton Window of acceptable Bitcoin proposals, framing CTV & CSFS as the comparatively “conservative” options. It’s important to note that most OP_CAT supporters are also in favor of BIPs 119 and 348 (and most proposals in general).

What can we expect next? For one, more conversation. Developers are expected to gather at a few technical conferences such as OPNEXT in April, BTC++ in July and TABConf in October. Once developers begin to form rough consensus, then the actual activation of the soft fork moves to the miners, community and investors.

However, there isn’t a formalized process for “how to soft fork Bitcoin.” So we’re left with a lot of open questions. For example, will a potential soft fork include just CTV and CSFS? Will OP_CAT – which is often included in this opcode suite – join the conversation? How will an actual soft fork activation happen? And will other stakeholders like Bitcoin miners take note?

Only one thing is clear: you’re going to have to get comfortable with lots of abbreviations.

Bitcoin and Ethereum prices continue to struggle amid a broader market downturn.

“This also marks the 17th straight day of outflows, the longest negative streak since our records began in 2015,” Butterfill noted.

Despite the gloom, year-to-date inflows remain in positive territory at $912 million.

What analysts are however looking at is the sustained price correction. To many, this is likely to dent investor confidence, which is low after tariffs concerns and general jittery outlook across risk asset markets.

Wemix Foundation’s CEO doesn’t believe the hack is the result of Lazarus

Kim Seok-hwan, Wemix Foundation’s CEO, said there was “no attempt” to conceal a $6.2 million hack on it following an announcement four days later.

In a press conference on Monday, Kim denied any intention to conceal the exploit.

On February 28, over 8.65 million WEMIX coins were withdrawn due to a malicious attack on the platform’s Play Bridge Vault. However, the South Korean platform only alerted its investors when an announcement was posted on its homepage on March 4.

At the press conference, Kim said: “The announcement was delayed due to concerns about the possibility of additional attacks and the possibility of market panic due to stolen assets.”

According to Kim, most of the assets had already been sold and the market impact had already happened, adding that there was no guarantee of “additional risk.”

Sophisticated attack

Bowing his head several times at the press conference, Kim acknowledged full responsibility for the delayed announcement.

Explaining what happened, Kim said an unidentified attacker stole the service monitoring authentication key for its non-fungible token (NFT) platform Nile. According to Kim, the attacker planned the hack for two months, creating abnormal transactions and attempting 15 withdrawals.

Of these, two failed, but 13 were successful, resulting in the theft of 8.65 million Wemix.

After learning of the exploit, Kim said they shut down the server and began a detailed analysis. They also filed a complaint against the attacker with the Cyber ​​Investigation Unit of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

Kim believes that the hack was unlikely carried out by Lazarus, the North Korean-backed hacking group.

Latest hack

In recent weeks, several platforms have suffered security breaches, resulting in the theft of various coins.

Last month, Bybit was hacked after those responsible drained $1.4 billion worth of Ethereum from a single wallet. It was later reported that Lazarus was behind the theft.

Days later, Infini suffered a $50 million hack. The attacker in this case had retained the admin rights after working on Infini’s development contract, enabling them to gain access to the funds.

Regarding the Wemix Foundation, Kim said on March 13 that they will buy back 10 billion Korean won (around $7 million) worth of Wemix tokens. The following day, the foundation announced plans to purchase a further 20 million tokens.

During the press conference, Kim said they are working towards fully resuming services on Friday, March 21 after introducing new security measures to their blockchain infrastructure.",coinjournal

Unlike previous promotions that targeted specific trading pairs or user tiers, this new program extends zero maker and taker fees to every pair available in the Binance Wallet. Users will enjoy no trading costs for the six months.

🚀 Enjoy zero trading fees on all swaps in #Binance Wallet for the next 6 months! Start trading now! 🔥 — Binance Wallet (@BinanceWallet) March 17, 2025

Binance’s big move will make trading more accessible, particularly for retail investors and high-frequency traders who rely on cost efficiency to maximize returns.

According to the exchange, the zero-fee trading offer aims to “remove barriers to entry and empower users to engage with the crypto market seamlessly.”

The Binance Wallet, an integrated feature of the platform, allows users to store, manage, and trade assets directly, and this zero-fee structure is expected to drive increased adoption of the wallet service.

By covering all pairs—ranging from major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to emerging altcoins.

This announcement builds on Binance’s history of offering fee incentives, such as its 2022 zero-fee Bitcoin trading program and subsequent promotions for stablecoin pairs like First Digital USD (FDUSD) and True USD (TUSD) stablecoins.

However, the scale of this latest offering—encompassing all pairs within the Binance Wallet—signals an ambitious push to solidify its market dominance amid evolving industry trends.

Traders laud Binance move

Users across the ecosystem have lauded the exchange’s move. Many are pointing to this as a customer-centric approach.

One trader remarked:

“Zero-fee trading for all pairs in the Binance Wallet? This is a game-changer!”

Others echoed similar sentiments, noting that the move could set a new standard in the competitive crypto exchange landscape.

Binance has assured users that standard security and compliance measures will remain in place.

The exchange also cautioned that it reserves the right to amend or cancel the promotion at its discretion, a common practice in its previous fee-related programs.

Binance has encouraged users to monitor official exchange channels for updates or any adjustments to the initiative.",coinjournal

https://coinjournal.net,PepeX set to launch world’s first AI-powered meme launchpad,https://coinjournal.net/news/pepex-set-to-launch-worlds-first-ai-powered-meme-launchpad/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 09:20:08 GMT","PepeX.fun comes to the ecosystem by making fair launches fair again.

The meme launchpad’s PEPX presale goes live on March 24, 2025, with price at $0.02.

An ambitious roadmap and the fact that PepeX could topple Pump.fun has investors excited.

The meme coin world is on the cusp of a major upgrade as the world’s first artificial intelligence-powered launchpad sets for presale launch.

PepeX will blend meme creation with AI to flip the script on a market that has long heaved under the negative effect of manipulation and insider schemes. For investors and the broader community, the era of snipers, rug pulls and failed tokens on Pump.fun is coming to an end.

As Pump.fun hits a snag, the new era begins with PepeX (PEPX) launching its presale on March 24, 2025.

PepeX begins meme coins’ new AI-powered era

No doubt Solana-based Pump.fun has been the king of meme coin creation, launching 7.8 million tokens and raking in half a billion in fees.

However, that’s all just stats for the trenches. A look at what it means for everyday traders only returns a grim story: just 0.4% of traders make profits above $10k. The vast majority lose money as insiders and snipers become overnight millionaires. LIBRA, and recently WOLF – all linked to Hayden Davies – are an example.

This game of rugpulls and manipulation is what PepeX is looking to tear down with its new AI-powered meme coin factory. With anti-sniping protections, transparent bubble maps, and a strict 5% cap on founder allocations, it’s about leveling the playing field for degens.

If a project tanks, founders lose their locked liquidity. This is what gets redistributed to the community. In short, PepeX could be the end of exit scams in the memecoin world.

What gives PepeX an edge?

An AI-powered moonshot engine allows users to create viral meme coins just by uploading an image. It could be a dog, frog, or whatever has the potential to galvanise a community. There’s no devs or such other hassle.

With Pump.fun’s reign crumbling, PepeX is taking over. But rather than favour founders and insiders, the platform’s mechanism will ensure only high-quality projects launch to the public.

PepeX handles everything about the meme coin – branding, marketing, community management, and decentralized exchange listing.

Moreover, PEPX holders will have share in platform fees, which is projected to skyrocket as the meme market cap inches towards the $1 trillion mark.

The PepeX presale and tokenomics

The project’s strapline says it all: “Making fair launches fair again.” Transparent token distribution, standardized smart contracts, and AI-driven tools eliminate friction and open meme coin creation to everyone.

PepeX launches March 24, 2025, with a 90-day presale kicking off at $0.02 per token.

🔴 BREAKING: The WORLD'S FIRST AI powered meme launchpad PepeX, launching presale March 24! A fair, community-driven platform that puts the power back in YOUR hands. No sniping, no shady tokenomics—just pure DeFi and memes. Lock in: https://t.co/tzp4VeZ9yf pic.twitter.com/dfkTQWdFMn — PepeX (@PepeX_fun) March 16, 2025

With a total supply of 5 billion, 2.25 billion or 45% of this will be up for grabs over a 90-day presale period. The PEPX token’s value will rise at increment levels of 5% from stage 1 to the last one – offering early adopters a chance to net unrealized profits of up 311.5% ahead of its market debut.

Excitement around PepeX goes beyond its quest to right Pump.fun wrongs. The community is upbeat on what’s next given the ambitious roadmap. Key highlights include smart contract development, AI agent ecosystem, DEX partnerships and decentralised AI launchpad takeover.

While skepticism abounds about meme coins and new launches, PepeX aims to change this perspective.

https://coinjournal.net,Ourbit Distributes 85% of $BITCH Memecoin to Community Alongside SuperCEX Debut with DEX Integration,https://coinjournal.net/news/ourbit-distributes-85-of-bitch-memecoin-to-community-alongside-supercex-debut-with-dex-integration/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 08:53:12 GMT","Singapore, Singapore, March 13th, 2025, Chainwire

Ourbit, one of the fastest-growing memecoin-focused exchanges of 2024, today announced the launch of Phase 3 of its $BITCH memecoin airdrop campaign. With Phase 1 continuing through March 31 and Phase 2 now completed, Ourbit is allocating 85% of the token’s 1 billion supply directly to community members through this multi-phase airdrop. This airdrop campaign coincides with Ourbit’s debut of the world’s first “SuperCEX,” a hybrid trading model that integrates DEX capabilities with centralized exchange functionality, poised to transcend the boundaries of CeFi and DeFi and reshape how crypto assets are traded.

Prophetic Listings Meets Degen DNA: The Memecoin SuperCEX

While traditional centralized exchanges have kept memecoins at arm’s length, Ourbit has consistently embraced them as a true cultural phenomena that drive expressions of community identity and crypto-native culture. The platform has established itself as a leading hub for memecoin trading because of its comprehensive selection of memecoin trading pairs, industry-leading memecoin liquidity, and its strategic approach – listing tokens like $SPX (up 96x), $VIRTUAL (up 56x), $KOMA (up 49x), and $ACT (up 46x) before their rise.

$BITCH: 85% to the Community, 100% to Degen Energy

From Ourbit’s perspective, memecoins are not simply speculative assets. With $BITCH, Ourbit is acknowledging the central role that memecoins play in onboarding new users to crypto and driving trading volume across the ecosystem. The $BITCH ticker represents the evolution of Ourbit’s beloved iconic “Queen” mascot – the fierce, commanding female figure who has become synonymous with the platform’s degen-first approach to crypto trading. While some centralized exchanges might remain detached observers of memecoin culture, Ourbit understands the unique psychology and motivations of degen traders.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-cnFxSQkhI]

With the total supply of $BITCH being 1 billion, Ourbit is distributing 85% of $BITCH total supply to the community, demonstrating its maximum degen energy. $BITCH represents more than just a token—it serves as a cultural symbol that acknowledges and engages the degen community, which has played a key role in Ourbit’s expansion. This strategic move further solidifies Ourbit’s ambition in forging a new breed of exchange, for the next generation of degen traders.

3-Phase Airdrop: The Ultimate Degen Reward System

The $BITCH airdrop mechanics retroactively reward Ourbit’s early users while incentivizing new user acquisition and high-frequency trading activity for its DEX platform:

Phase 1: February 26th – March 31st, 2025 (ACTIVE)

Retroactive airdrops for Ourbit’s early supporters and users

Existing Ourbit users can visit Ourbit’s dedicated airdrop page at www.ourbit.com/activity/airdrop to check for eligibility for Phase 1 airdrops

Phase 2: March 3rd – March 10th, 2025 (COMPLETED)

Invite & Earn – Users can complete daily tasks and invite others to sign up on Ourbit DEX to accumulate points, with $BITCH distribution determined based on the points earned.

Phase 3: March 13th, 12PM EST (March 14th, 4PM UTC) until all mystery boxes are distributed

Invite & Trade – Mystery box fragments can be obtained through Futures trading, DEX trading, or inviting others to join. These fragments can be used to open mystery boxes, which may contain $BITCH rewards.

Crypto enthusiasts and traders interested in participating in the $BITCH Airdrop Phase 3 can visit www.ourbit.com/activity/airdrop to register for Ourbit’s DEX platform

Redefining Centralized Exchange (CEX) Architecture

Ourbit isn’t stopping with the memecoin launch. The siloed nature of CeFi and DeFi has been a significant barrier to mainstream adoption. Today’s traders shouldn’t have to choose between the speed of centralized platforms and the sovereignty of decentralized protocols. Ourbit has engineered a solution to one of crypto’s most persistent pain points. Its SuperCEX hybrid model is the industry’s first true integration of decentralized exchange (DEX) capabilities into a centralized platform. Ourbit has created the ultimate hassle-free trading experience where it handles all the complexity, so users can focus solely on capitalizing on opportunities.

SuperCEX: Trading Everything On One App

Ourbit’s SuperCEX delivers seamless access to both on-chain and off-chain assets through a single interface, fundamentally transforming how traders discover and access new assets:

No more juggling multiple wallets, exchanges, or Telegram trading bots

AI-curated trading feed for high-potential on-chain asset discovery

Real-time data and smart money tracking

*Currently, Ourbit’s DEX product is in the beta testing phase and only the website version is available, users can expect more upgrades and the app version to be on the way.

With Ourbit – The Future of Trading Is Hybrid

Ourbit is launching more than just a token and a new feature. By combining the $BITCH memecoin with the SuperCEX model, Ourbit creates a practical solution for traders who want access to all types of crypto opportunities in one place. The SuperCEX approach breaks down the walls between centralized and decentralized systems, giving traders what they actually need: maximum degen trading potential unlocked with institutional-grade trading tools.

About OURBIT

Ourbit is the world’s 1st SuperCEX integrating CEX and DEX in one platform, allowing users to trade all on-chain and off-chain assets in just one app. Ourbit delivers the most comprehensive memecoin trading pairs, industry-leading memecoin liquidity, and prophetic listing strategy with a proven track record of identifying explosive gems before other exchanges ($SPX 96X, $VIRTUAL 56X, $KOMA 49X since listed on Ourbit). Founded by ex-founding teams of top-tier exchanges with authentic roots in memecoin ecosystems, Ourbit has earned official endorsements from memecoin projects such as Retardio, HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu and more. With its $BITCH memecoin launch in 2025 Q1, Ourbit SuperCEX combines institutional expertise with degen DNA to empower traders in pursuit of “meme-ionaire” dreams.

""J'ai l'honneur de vous annoncer que tous ensemble, nous nous sommes engagés sur un total de 5,8 milliards d'euros, 4,2 milliards d'euros en dons et 1,6 en prêts"", a déclaré la commissaire européenne pour la Méditerranée Dubravka Suica, au terme de la neuvième édition de cette conférence internationale.Ce chiffre est nettement inférieur à l'engagement pris par cette même conférence l'an dernier, qui avait atteint 7,5 milliards d'euros. Les États-Unis étaient alors, selon l'ONU, le premier fournisseur d'aide internationale à la Syrie, qui soit exsangue de près de 15 ans de guerre civile.Les États-Unis de Donald Trump ont décidé la suspension de leur aide internationale, y compris celle attribuée à la Syrie.""Pendant les 14 dernières années, les États-Unis ont fourni davantage d'assistance pour le peuple syrien que n'importe quelle autre nation, soit plus de 18,3 milliards de dollars"", a rappelé Natasha Franceschi, la représentante américaine à cette conférence.Elle a indiqué que son pays continuerait à fournir une aide, ""conformément aux lois américaines"", mais que Washington s'attendait désormais à ce que les autres pays prennent le relais.

Il ne peut pas revenir. Nous ne ménagerons aucun de nos efforts pour traduire en justice quiconque a perpétré un tel crime, a du sang sur les mains"", a assuré le chef de la diplomatie syrienne, selon une traduction simultanée de son discours prononcé en arabe.Les forces de sécurité, des groupes armés alliés ou des djihadistes étrangers ont été rendus responsables de ces violences qui ont fait, selon une ONG, près de 1.400 morts dans la population civile, principalement au sein de la communauté alaouite, une branche du chiisme, dont est issu l'ancien président Bachar al-Assad.Les Vingt-Sept, qui ont très vite après le 8 décembre décidé de soutenir la transition en Syrie, veulent y voir un phénomène isolé.""Nous condamnons avec force ces attaques, particulièrement celles ciblant les civils.

North America has some of the most impressive classic car museums on the planet.

America has an undying love for the automobile. Looking back at the classic automobile in modern days is how you see art and history combined in one. If you’re looking to see this rich history in person, here are some of the best classic car museums in the country.

Volo Auto Museum

Volo, Illinois

Volo is a family friendly auto museum near Chicago with tons of exhibits to visit. The facility houses some of the most highly-desirable collector cars you can find, and since a lot of them are up for sale, you can take home something to add to your collection. They also have an animatronic dinosaur adventure and host special things around the holidays like Cars and Costumes around Halloween - you’ll never hear ‘I’m bored’ from your kids if you take them here.

America's Car Museum

Tacoma, Washington

If you’re a car collector and find yourself in the northwest, America’s Car Museum guarantees that you will have an unforgettable experience. It has a variety of cars of all generations of automotive production, including some exceptional pre and post war cars. Additionally, its home to one of the most significant North American displays of historic Alfa RomeosIt also has a learning lab to inspire younger generations.

Blackhawk Museum

Danville, California



This museum in California is not just for car people, but has an exceptionally impressive classic car collection on exhibit. Both words priceless and pricey could be used to describe the collection, with quite a few one-of-a-kind pieces. There’s a strong emphasis on luxury and historically significant vehicles from all over the world.

The Henry Ford

Dearborn, Michigan

The Henry Ford sprawls over 25 acres and includes the Henry Ford Museum of Innovation and an immersive experience called the Greenfield Village. The village will put you back in time and allows visitors to feel what it was like during the Detroit boom. Visitors can even ride along in a Model T, a massive draw for automotive enthusiasts.

Lane Motor Museum

Nashville, Tennessee

The Lane Motor Museum is one of the few in North America to highlight European cars. More interestingly, they showcase cars that are not always museum quality, while some very much are. This gives you a true look at the natural aging of some notable and rare classic European cars.

Petersen Automotive Museum

Los Angeles, California

The Petersen is one of the most recognizable names, and they attract some of the most lavish car collections around. One thing about the Petersen, you won’t ever get tired of what you see, but you might also miss some interesting cars if you don’t plan accordingly. Given their location, they also attract some very famous car collectors as well.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Our Toyota Grand Highlander Goes Way Past Empty Before It’s Out of Gas,https://autos.yahoo.com/toyota-grand-highlander-goes-way-200800321.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 20:08:00 GMT","Welcome to Car and Driver's Testing Hub, where we zoom in on the test numbers. We've been pushing vehicles to their limits since 1956 to provide objective data to bolster our subjective impressions (you can see how we test here).



Our long-term Toyota Grand Highlander with the new 362-hp Hybrid Max powertrain has been the subject of an ongoing mystery amongst our staff. One of the most common complaints leveled at the otherwise great three-row SUV is a relative lack of range on road trips. Part of the issue is that most hybrids—this one included—don’t achieve their EPA highway fuel-economy figures when traveling at real-world interstate speeds of 75-plus miles per hour. In our highway fuel-economy test, which we run at a steady 75 mph, the Grand Highlander averaged 24 mpg versus the EPA's 27-mpg figure. But on the real road trips our staff has undertaken, with speeds sometimes higher, and through frigid winter weather with knobbier all-weather Goodyear Assurance WeatherReady 2 tires installed, we often see mpg averages in the low 20s.

Something Strange with the Range

But that doesn’t entirely explain why we are regularly stopping to refuel at increments less than 300 miles, and we’ve never made it more than 400 miles on a tank. Toyota’s published specifications state that it has a 17.2-gallon fuel tank, but our regular fill-ups, even when running dangerously close to zero miles on the indicated trip computer, are in the high 13- to low 14-gallon range. It’s not just us, either, as we've seen plenty of similar discussions on owners' forums.

Michael Simari - Car and Driver

There are two possible explanations: The GH's fuel tank is smaller than the published value, or the trip computer is exceptionally conservative. So, we finally went for broke, pushing through all of our healthy fears of getting stranded and really ran it all the way down. After our GH showed an indicated zero miles of range, we did another 60 miles at near-80-mph highway speeds and then circled our local Shell station for the final three miles until the tank ran dry. During this experiment, we also discovered another interesting feature: Even after the gas tank is empty, the GH lets you drive a little further (0.6 mile in our case) on the remaining energy left in the hybrid system, which allowed us just enough to get to a pump.

What Does Toyota Have to Say?

We pumped 16.498 gallons using our typical ""three-click"" method of three automatic shutoffs separated by a five count in between. But continuing to top off until we saw fuel in the filler neck got the tally to 17.402 gallons, slightly more than the stated capacity.

When we asked Toyota about this, the company responded with a fairly boilerplate statement: ""We are aware of the field concern and we are investigating the matter on how to best address customer concerns."" While we wait for the fix, we now know we can push aside our fears and keep driving well past the point that it indicates empty.

https://finance.yahoo.com,These Guys Drove a Real 1927 Bugatti—and More—over the Alps in Winter!,https://autos.yahoo.com/guys-drove-real-1927-bugatti-193700122.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 19:37:00 GMT","What used to be just one race a year—the revival of the Mille Miglia in Italy—has grown into a number of very fun events all over the world, from Mille Miglia tributes in China, Japan, the UAE, and even Florida, to the Coppa delle Alpi, a re-creation of a winter race over the Alps that started in 1921.

This year, on March 13 in the city of Brescia (traditional start of the Mille Miglia), 40 cars took the green flag and headed north into the ice and snow of the frozen Alps.

The entries included: four Porsche 356s, two Aston Martin DB4s (and a DB2), period-correct entries from Jaguar, Triumph, and Austin Healey, three Ferraris (two from the 1980s and a 348 from 1991), as well as a couple of Fiat 508 Cs.

The goal on the morning of the first day was lunch in the ski resort town of Tirano (it’s a civilized event, after all), followed by a charge over the Swiss border to St. Moritz, which had only weeks before hosted the GP I.C.E. Race.

Next day was back into Italy, then over the Fuorn Pass to Austria and on to the Tyrolean town of Brixen.

Saturday, March 15, may have been the best leg as the cavalcade of classic cars crisscrossed the spectacular Dolomites, topping the Sella Pass then threading the Fassa and the Fiemme valleys. The cars reached the beautiful Lake Serraia and then went on to Baselga di Piné, where the last lunch of the race was hosted. After reaching Trento back in Italy, the race ended with the award ceremony in Ponte di Legno on top of the final pass of the run: Tonale. No doubt named after the Alfa Romeo (or vice versa).

We give you the detailed route in case you want to fly to Italy and rent a car for a week, which we would definitely recommend.

While 40 cars started this year, the fifth running of this commemorative race, the Coppa will accommodate twice that.

“A maximum of 80 cars built up to 1990 will be accepted to the race, which will compete to win one of the 7 guarantees of acceptance to the 1000 Miglia 2026 up for grabs,” read the google-translated statement from event organizers.

So you could potentially qualify for the Mille Miglia, the grandaddy of all great races. Plan now for next year.

All rise for the Judge.

Gran Turismo Omologato, or GTO, is a name that inspires images of pure muscle car dominance on the roads of America. Even bigger than the GTO name alone, arguably, would be the calling of 'The Judge' - a nickname adopted from the “Here Comes the Judge” made famous by Sammy Davis Jr. on the popular comedy television show Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In.

Read about the history of the muscle car here.

The original run of the Pontiac GTO was produced from 1964 to 1974, as an aggressive performance car, with big displacement engines, and unforgettable body-lines. Pontiac intended The Judge to be a more affordable competitor of the Plymouth Road Runner, but ended up making it slightly more expensive than the Mopar.

To celebrate this amazing GTO variant, here are a few grab bag facts that make the Judge awesome.

Initially Only Available In Carousel Red

When you conjure images of The Judge, you're probably picturing one in Carousel Red - other than being striking in this color, it was originally the only color you could get one in. Although the color is called red, most would argue that the famous paint color is a deep orange. After the first thousand cars were made, the GTO was given more color options, but the original is still the most highly coveted.

Convertibles Are The Rarer Version

Back in the 1960s and 1970s, demand for convertible body styles was way down. Gone were the days of dreamy cruises with your sweetheart with the top down in your Tri-Five. This was the main driver of lack of higher production of convertible models, but those low production numbers make cars more desirable today. Since only 108 convertibles were made under the name in 1969, the convertible Judge is the rarest of the trim.

1971 Was Another Rare Circumstance

The 1969 year saw the highest production numbers of The Judge, and the 1971, the last year of the trim, was the lowest production year with only 374 of the cars sold. This is one case, however, when low-production does not necessarily mean more desirability in the collector car market; the 1969 is still the king, and the face-lifted later models seem to have turned more buyers away.

Hurst T-Handle's Were A Staple

It was pretty common to see the Hurst T-Handle shifter on many American muscle cars, and The Judge carried that along. The cars came standard with a three-speed manual transmission, and the T-Handle made sure everyone knew it.

The Judge Logo Was Inspired By Carter's Ink Typography

The hearty logo for The Judge is iconically perfect for the era it was made. Logo designer William Porter drew his inspiration for The Judge logo from a magazine ad showing Carter's India Ink. Porter never specified which ad kicked off his creativity, we're sure glad he saw it!

Dangerous Temper Tantrum: Bay Area Road Rage Shooting Caught On Camera

Dashcam footage recorded by a Tesla shows a road rage shooting go down in California’s Bay Area. It’s a shocking reminder of how getting into it with a stranger on the street can turn into a potentially deadly situation.

A classic muscle car abandoned for almost three decades finally gets cleaned up by professionals.

That footage, which has been blurred to hide any gore, shows two cars stop still partly in the lane of travel on a fairly busy road. As the vehicle in front of the Tesla goes around the two stopped cars, a man in a black Camry gets out and starts walking toward what looks like a silver Camry.

Advertisement Advertisement

As he does, the other driver steps out, immediately firing on the man from the black Camry, who drops to the ground immediately. The Tesla driver swerves to the left, probably to avoid any errant rounds coming in that direction, so we don’t see the shooter drive off.

A report from KTVU states the victim did survive. But we don’t know what kind of condition that man is in now.

Police aren’t saying if they even know who the shooter is or if that man has been arrested. While some people have thoughts about that, we’ve seen enough incidents like this to know there might be more to the story than just the brief footage.

For example, we don’t know if the victim was actually an aggressor and had a weapon in his hand as he approached the other car. He might have had a gun and shot at the other driver. We’ve seen cases like that where the person who’s seemingly the aggressor was simply defending themselves after a violent attack not recorded by a bystander.

What we do know is the Tesla driver had reason to take evasive action. Two out of four shots fired by the one driver hit the roof of the electric car, so it’s lucky two people weren’t shot.

This is why we don’t get into verbal exchanges, honking fights, or any other confrontations with other drivers on the road. You never know what the other person might be capable of doing.

The folks responsible for Norway's Fyllingsdalstunnelen -- a tunnel connecting the Bergen city center to a popular residential neighborhood -- took time and care to perfect the experience of biking or walking inside it. This tunnel only exists because rule dictate that any underground train requires a matching emergency exit tunnel in case of disaster on the tracks. It could just as easily have been a boring and empty tunnel exclusively for emergency vehicles and maintenance workers, but the city decided to make it something more. By filling the tunnel with colorful light, art pieces, rest stops, and vibrancy, as well as climate control, it has become a popular destination in itself, as well as a busy intra-city thoroughfare. The 1.8-mile tunnel already needed to be built in order to comply with statute, so the city chose to make it great, and it only cost an additional 29 million euros.

The city's goal was to reduce the local population's dependency on cars, promoting an ""environmentally friendly, efficient and safe transport system,"" according to a translation by Smithsonian Magazine. The tunnel features directional bike lanes and a path for walkers and joggers crafted from anti-fatigue blue rubber to help make walking the tunnel an even more comfortable experience. The tunnel takes about ten minutes by bike or 40 minutes walking. Google says that driving between Bergen and Fyllingsdal takes around 30 minutes, as you are required to take a longer route around the mountain that the tunnel cuts directly through. Even the train takes around 15 minutes from end to end, so why not hop on a bicycle and get there even faster?

Would You Like To Fyllingsdalstunnelen?

When given the opportunity to make everyday travel cheaper and easier for its citizens, Norway chooses to go above and beyond by making the experience memorable and comfortable. Living in America, it seems unfathomable that we would ever spend any amount of money to make life easier for people who don't have a car, or can't afford one. Not only is the train an important part of daily travel between the suburbs and the city center, but the tunnel that it facilitated has become a part of daily life for countless more Norwegians. A project like this in the U.S. would be exclusively grey cement, farmed out to the cheapest contractor, and reserved only for cars. Norwegians are just built from stronger and more resilient stuff than we are, choosing to ride their bicycles in the winter or up steep hills in order to avoid the hefty cost of car ownership altogether. When government isn't actively hostile to its citizens beautiful things can happen.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Dodge Charger Driver Shockingly Nonchalant After Driving into Backyard Swimming Pool,https://autos.yahoo.com/dodge-charger-driver-shockingly-nonchalant-181500440.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 18:15:00 GMT","The driver of a Dodge Charger was caught on camera last week in the Long Island town of Islip, New York acting shockingly nonchalant after his car went flying into a local family's backyard, leaving extensive damage to the fence and swimming pool.

A wild surveillance video shared by CBS 2 New York captures the moment on March 13 that the speeding muscle car — which, based on the images, appears to either be a Charger SRT 392 Widebody or a Charger SRT Hellcat Widebody — crashes through a fence and does a full end-over-end barrel roll across the backyard, eventually landing with its front end in the pool. After the crash, however, comes the truly odd part: the driver exits the vehicle through the passenger door, retrieves his coat from the back, and calmly walks away from the scene as if nothing happened.

As stunning as the footage of the crash itself is, what happens afterward is even more bewildering. The driver of the car climbs out of the car on the passenger side and apparently begins to walk away, when he seems to realize his possessions are still in the car, so he returns and retrieves his items before slowly walking off with the help of two people who CBS 2 says were in the car behind him.

According to CBS 2, property resident Emely Bisono returned home from shopping to find the Charger in the backyard of her house, where her two children and her mother were at home during the crash. (All of the home's residents were uninjured.) Bisono says the wrecked car smelled of marijuana, and says her pool needs a hazmat cleanup because of the spilled oil and gas, in addition to the physical damage caused to the yard.

One more piece of high strangeness surrounds the events: while the driver walking away from the scene might seem to imply the Charger was stolen, police say that is not the case — and also stated that the car is both properly registered and fully insured. Authorities say the search is on to find the driver.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Renault’s New Electric RWD Hot Hatch Boasts 533 HP and a Rally Handbrake,https://autos.yahoo.com/renault-electric-rwd-hot-hatch-175400406.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 17:54:00 GMT","A few months ago, Renault shared a concept for a performance version of its popular Renault 5 electric hatchback. Despite being shaped like an economy car, that concept sent a claimed output of more than 500 electric horsepower to the rear wheels alone. It almost seemed too good to be true — but it turns out the production version of the R5 Turbo 3E will be even better. Because the one heading for the streets has has 570 horsepower.

Renault

All that power is still going to the car's rear wheels. Renault calls the resulting product a ""mini supercar,"" which seems like an accurate description for an electric hot hatch delivering that kind of force to just one set of drive wheels. Interestingly enough, the power comes from two in-wheel motors, which Renault says will allow for even more immediate torque delivery than a typical EV setup.

The exterior is set apart dramatically from the average Renault by a bulky widebody kit. Since the car only seats two, the hatch uses a conventional two-door setup. The car will be available in a few specs paying tribute to classic Renault rally liveries, but buyers can also opt for their own custom look, too.

Renault

Just as the exterior has been radically modified from a typical R5, the Turbo 3E's interior is unique too. Bucket seats, six-point harnesses, a roll cage, and a vertical handbrake complete the look of a modern Group B homologation special. A digital dashboard displays an analog-looking interface, a reminder that this car is meant to be a cutting edge take on the wild rally cars of the early 1980s.

Advertisement Advertisement

Renault plans to start building the R5 Turbo 3E in 2027, giving the brand a long runway to make this particular dream a reality. When it does arrive, the French company says that the hatch will get over 250 miles of range from its 70-kWh battery. Despite the relatively large battery for a small car like this, the R5 Turbo 3E is still expected to weigh under 3200 pounds.

Renault

Unfortunately, an American production run doesn't seem any more likely now than it did when Renault first revealed the R5 Turbo 3E concept. Renault says that it plans to build 1980 units of the car, all aimed at ""key markets including Europe, the Middle East, Japan, and Australia."" American buyers may be getting a crossover from Renault's sister brand Alpine soon, but the French company's crown jewel seems like it will be reserved for the rest of the world.

The Tesla Cybertruck and Ineos Grenadier 4x4, products of Elon Musk and Sir Jim Ratcliffe respectively, are the latest in a number of high-profile recalls of cas for safety-related faults.

Bentley has had to recall 11,000 Bentayga SUVs because they were a fire risk, while some Aston Martins might dump all their engine oil.

We tend to hear about recalls that affect thousands or even millions of models – such as the Takata airbag concerns that hit 67 million cars – from a wide variety of manufacturers of more humble machinery, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States. But we rarely hear about the high-end brands that are affected.

Bentley recalled 11,000 Bentaygas due to fire risk - James Lipman

Recalls are a fact of motoring life

In 2024, there were 249 recalls on 256 models from 41 brands of car, reported to European Safety Gate, which monitors how manufacturers deal with safety problems. As cars have become more complex, that number is around five times higher than it was in the 1990s.

Advertisement Advertisement

Add motorcycles and commercial vehicles and the increase is even more pronounced. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) figures show 1,025 affected vehicles last year compared with only 92 in 1994. The DVSA says there have already been 35 recall notices issued in 2025, although half of those are either commercial vehicles or two-wheelers.

No car owner is immune from recalls

Even the world’s most expensive motors have had to be recalled. In 2022, Rolls-Royce contacted owners of its £300,000-plus Cullinan and Ghost models because of a concern that the fuel tank feed line may not be fitted correctly. A possible malfunction would doubtless result in failure to proceed.

You don’t realise how prone cars are to potentially catching fire until you start reading through recall notices. Lamborghini’s Urus, the rocket-ship SUV beloved of football players and rappers, was recalled in 2020 because “the integrity of the quick connector of the fuel line in the engine compartment may be compromised”. In English, that means the fuel line to the engine bay might fail. And fuel spraying round a hot engine bay would ruin anyone’s day.

There are currently 19 variants of Lamborghini with recall actions against them, including the Lamborghini Urus

At present, 16 variants of Rolls-Royce and 19 Lamborghinis have recall actions issued against them in the UK, while Ferrari has 55.

Advertisement Advertisement

The Italian firm’s current recalls go all the way back to the mid-1980s 328, which might suffer from collapsing front suspension. New models are also affected. The SF90 Stradale suffers from turbocharger oil delivery pipes that can leak “with a risk of fire”.

Premium brands feature prominently in recalls, too. Figures from the DVSA show that last year, BMW issued 48 recalls, Mercedes-Benz 34 and Volvo 32. BMW’s were mainly for undetected exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) leaks that may cause “thermal activity” in the intake manifold. Presumably too much thermal activity results in an old-fashioned fire.

How are recalls policed?

The DVSA is the department charged with overseeing safety recalls in the UK. This came about after the General Product Safety Regulations came into force in January 2004. These relate to anything that can pose a safety risk, from white goods to toys to cars.

It claims “a producer and/or distributor is required to inform the competent authority of any issues they have with the safety of their products”.

Ferrari has 55 recall actions issued against them, citing a ‘failure due to design and/or construction’

About cars, the regulations add: “A safety-related defect is a failure due to design and/or construction, which is likely to affect the safe operation of the product/aftermarket part without prior warning to the user, and may pose a significant risk to the driver, occupants and others. This defect will be common to a number of products/aftermarket parts that have been sold for use in the United Kingdom.”

Advertisement Advertisement

Information is also swapped between the DVSA and European authorities via the EU’s Safety Gate system. How well does it work? Not very, if recent BBC research is correct that 72 per cent of recalled cars remain on the road without the rectification work being carried out.

What happens during a recall?

Once the car maker has informed the DVSA of a problem, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) can release keeper information to the manufacturer. This enables it to get in touch with all the owners of affected vehicles.

The DVSA stresses: “Care should be taken with the wording to avoid encouraging enthusiastic DIY keepers from taking matters into their own hands.” Rather than amateurs messing about with volatile airbag propellant, for instance, owners are encouraged to take their car to a franchised dealership where the fault can be addressed free of charge, usually by swapping parts.

When is a recall not a recall?

When it’s a technical service bulletin (TSB). These are only carried out by manufacturers, normally under the guise of a service campaign. A TSB is to resolve a non-safety-related problem or performance facet, frequently a software update, that is carried out during the scheduled service. Owners often don’t even know they’ve been done.

EVs can be hit by recalls too

We’re often told that EVs are more reliable and cheaper to service than combustion-engined cars. The latter point is broadly true. However, they are just as likely to be recalled. In November 2024, Kia and Hyundai recalled more than 208,000 EVs because of a problem with driveshafts that could fail under load, leaving drivers powerless and thus helpless.

Tesla, too, has undergone a raft of recalls. The Model 3 has eight actions, the Model S seven, the Model X six and the Model Y two. Problems include the passenger airbag not deploying, loss of power steering assistance, the parking brake not releasing correctly and the bonnet not latching properly.

The Renault Zoe has been recalled for an internal short circuit to its battery and some older (2012-16) Nissan Leafs may suffer from loss of steering control.

Pablo Escobar’s Forgotten Passion: The Story of His Porsche 911 Carrera RSR

Pablo Escobar is remembered as the notorious leader of the Medellín Cartel, one of history’s most powerful and dangerous drug lords. However, beyond his empire of crime, Escobar had a little-known passion—racing cars. Among his most prized vehicles was a 1974 Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0 RSR IROC, a rare classic once driven by Formula 1 World Champion Emerson Fittipaldi.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYAQnvYswaY

Advertisement Advertisement

This Porsche, originally built for the first International Race of Champions (IROC) season, would later find its way into Escobar’s hands. But like everything in his life, its journey was far from ordinary.

A Porsche with a Star-Studded Racing History

Before Escobar, this Porsche had already made a name for itself. The car was first owned by Roger Penske, who entered it into the inaugural IROC season in 1974. It was driven by Emerson Fittipaldi, one of the world’s top racing drivers at the time.

After its IROC career, the car found its way into the hands of John Tunstall, who raced it in IMSA events, including the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring. Then, in a surprising turn, it was sold to Pablo Escobar in Colombia, where it would take on a new life under the drug lord’s ownership.

Escobar’s Love for Racing and the Porsche 911 RSR

Long before Escobar built his drug empire, he was obsessed with speed—not the kind he smuggled, but the kind he could feel behind the wheel. His racing career started in the Copa Renault 4 series in the 1970s, where he competed alongside Colombian drivers like Ricardo “Cuchilla” Londoño.

Advertisement Advertisement

When Escobar acquired the Porsche 911 Carrera RSR, he modified it to look like a Porsche 935 slant-nose, fitting it with Martini Racing livery. He raced it in hill climbs and road races across South America, even betting he could finish within 15 seconds of Londoño in a hill climb event—a bet he won, a moment he reportedly bragged about for years.

However, as his cartel empire grew in the 1980s, Escobar had less time for racing. His illegal fortune funded other drivers, including an unsuccessful attempt to place Londoño in Formula 1.

The Porsche Resurfaces: A Restoration to Its Former Glory

After Escobar’s death in 1993, many of his cars were destroyed by rivals or seized by authorities. However, his Porsche 911 RSR survived. The car was eventually restored to its original 1974 IROC specifications, removing Escobar’s modifications and returning it to its Sahara Beige paint and race decals.

In 2021, the Porsche made headlines again when it was listed for sale, reminding the world of its bizarre and historic journey—from IROC competition to the hands of the world’s most infamous drug lord.

A Classic Porsche with an Unmatched Story

With only 15 examples of the 1974 Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0 RSR IROC ever built, this car was already a rare and valuable piece of racing history. But its connection to Emerson Fittipaldi, Roger Penske, and Pablo Escobar makes it truly one-of-a-kind.

It’s not just a classic Porsche—it’s a car that raced at the top level, became part of a cartel kingpin’s personal collection, and ultimately returned to its rightful place among the world’s most coveted race cars.

That's right, old fashioned train heists are back with more than $4 million worth of goods stolen from a single freight train operator in California over less than two years.

Thieves in California regularly target the Burlington Northern Santa Fe rail operator, which carries freight through the state, reports Business Insider. Groups are reportedly boarding trains with saws, bolt-cutters and other tools to crack open cases of valuable goods like footwear, tools and electronics.

The attacks on freight trains have hit everything from Turtle Beach Stealth Pro headsets to ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" toys, and that's just the goods that authorities have been able to recover. In total, authorities estimate that the BNSF railroad alone had more than $4 million worth of goods swiped from its trains since 2023.

Here's How You Rob A Train

Gangs reportedly target freight trains when they are headed eastbound from California's Interstate 40, reports Outside. Once they're onboard, crews of thieves get to work locating and stealing the goods:

Once thieves know the location of cargo, they board the train when it's stopped. Due to the size of freight trains, security guards can't patrol the entire vehicle, Lewis said. And train drivers are unarmed. Once crooks find the shipping containers, they cut the locks off with grinders or bolt cutters. Then, they toss the cargo to the ground, hide it in the underbrush, and wait for a follow car to pick it up.

Once a haul is stashed away, it's either picked up by a following truck that's being used by the criminals, or it's collected by law enforcement. Officers in California have unearthed stolen goods lining railroads, and placed trackers in some goods loaded onto trains to follow them once they are swiped.

Arrests Have Been Made

Authorities in California have arrested 11 people in connection with robberies on the railways so far this year. In many instances, the groups hitting BNSF trains had ""apparent links"" to Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel, which is an organized-crime group formerly led by drug lord Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán.

With organized crime hitting its trains, BNSF is taking action to protect its staff and reputation. In a statement shared with Outside, the operator said it had ""robust security protocols"" in place on trains it operated.

""We work hard to protect our customers' freight from pickup to delivery and have security measures in place to help ensure these goods arrive safely,"" the company added. ""We are working with federal, state, local, and tribal police departments to coordinate our approach to disrupting criminal activity and arresting offenders.""

Robberies On The Rise

Despite this hardline stance against train robberies, attacks on freight trains in America are on the rise and they aren't just hitting BNSF and its trains in California.

Across the country, BI reports that cargo thefts cost rail operators more than $100 million in 2024 after railroads were hit with more than 65,000 thefts over the 12-month period. Hits on railroads in 2024 were up by around 40 percent compared with 2023, industry groups told the site.

Despite the eye-watering value of goods lost on the railroad, operators like BNSF still bank their fair share. Last year, the operator generated nearly $24 billion in revenue and about $5 billion in net income, adds Business Insider.

The company's dealers in Italy have reportedly received a memo outlining the end of the current gas-powered Giulia and Stelvio nameplates, with production of those fan-favorite models allegedly set to wind down over the course of the year.

According to the alleged memo, which was first posted to the r/AlfaRomeo subreddit and then shared more broadly by MoparInsiders, the Giulia Quadrifoglio will the first model to get the axe, with March 31 being the last date to place orders. That vehicle has already been off the market in the States since the end of model year 2024, but remains on sale in Europe for the time being. The hot version of the Stelvio will reportedly follow suit, with the memo stating order books will close April 30.

Reddit — r/AlfaRomeo

The death of those models will see the end — for now, at least, of the Ferrari-derived 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V-6, which propelled the pair to rival the likes of BMW M and Mercedes-AMG. Sprint, Veloce, and Intensa trims, which feature the brand’s turbocharged 2.0-liter engine, will reportedly no longer be available for order after May 31. After that, customers will only be able to purchase a Stelvio or Giulia with the 2.2-liter turbodiesel engine on offer in Europe.

DW Burnett/Puppyknuckles

Road & Track has reached out to Alfa Romeo for confirmation on the aforementioned timeline. We'll update this story with any statement provided by the automaker.

Of course, we already know there won’t be too long a wait before the new models arrive. MoparInsiders has reported the new Stelvio SUV, which is slated to ride on Stellantis's STLA Large Platform, should debut on June 24 to celebrate the brand’s 115th anniversary. Given the flexible nature of the platform, don’t be surprised to see a variety of powertrain options find their way to the SUV, including traditional combustion, hybrids, and pure electric variants.

Alfa has also confirmed plans to replace the current Giulia, though that model isn’t expected to break cover until 2026 (potentially, however, as a crossover). That said, a similar powertrain lineup would likely be expected for the sedan. No word yet on what the future holds for the Quadrifoglio models, but BMW’s hybridized M5 might be a good hint at what’s to come.

Limited to 1980 units, the Turbo 3E follows from the retro 5 E-Tech but sports exaggerated bodywork and a motorsports-inspired livery.

A pair of electric motors send 536 horsepower to the rear wheels and shoot the hatchback from zero to 62 mph in under 3.5 seconds.

UPDATE 3/17/25: This story has been updated to incorporate new information regarding the Renault 5 3E's production and performance figures.



The Renault 5 E-Tech, an electric hatchback for the European market revealed earlier this year, already sported throwback styling. Its blocky shape references one of the brand's bestsellers, the Renault 5 of the '70s and '80s. But now the French automaker is leaning into the retro theme even further with the Renault 5 Turbo 3E, a dramatic-looking and potent hot hatchback that pays tribute to the Renault 5 Turbo that emerged from rally racing in the '80s.

Renault

While Renault has been cranking out all manner of wild concept cars in recent years—from the R17 restomod to the 5 Diamant—this rear-wheel-drive pocket rocket is going into limited production. Renault previewed the Turbo 3E with a concept car of the same name in 2022, and while the production car lacks the concept's ginormous rear wing, psychedelic color scheme, and cabin-mounted teddy bear (yes, you read that right), the Turbo 3E is still an eye-catching design.

The Turbo 3E sports a yellow-and-black livery that references the colors worn by Renault race cars in the 1980s. Renault also heavily revised the bodywork for this special edition, removing the rear set of doors and installing bulging rear fenders with trim that emulates the original 5 Turbo's chunky air intake. The front fender is similarly beefy and the front end gets a more squared-off appearance with rectangular headlights, a bumper with LED fog lights, and a trio of thin vents. At the rear, a sizable diffuser sits beneath a pair of spoilers, one affixed to the roof and one sprouting from between the taillights.

The Renault 5 Turbo 3E features an electric motor in each of its rear wheels, with the pair producing a combined 536 horsepower. According to Renault, the power is enough to send the Turbo 3E zipping from zero to 62 mph in fewer than 3.5 seconds. The 70 kWh battery runs on an 800-volt architecture and Renault says it can charge from 15 to 80 percent in just 15 minutes. That's good considering owners will likely be needing lots of charging after launching from every red light and stop sign.

The company is only planning to build 1980 examples of the hot hatch, each of which will be numbered. Renault hasn't confirmed the price yet, but it will surely be significantly higher than the roughly $27,000 needed for the standard 5 E-Tech when reservations open.

Here are six car brands that experts say are high quality and low cost for those on a budget.

Nissan, Honda and Toyota

“Nissan, Toyota and Honda are and have been high-quality builds at an affordable price,” Chris Pyle, an auto expert with JustAnswer, wrote in an email. “These manufacturers still offer their lower-cost vehicles with some basic amenities to make the cars affordable, and there are still car owners that do not want or need all the extras cars come with now.”

Pyle also recommended sticking with small and midsize sedans, smaller SUVs, and smaller trucks if you want to stay within budget.

“[Toyotas] may not be the cheapest cars on the market, but they have reasonable price points,” explained Melanie Musson, auto industry expert with CarInsurance.org. “Since they depreciate more slowly than average, owners lose less money over their years of ownership.”

Musson also pointed out that Toyota engines are some of the most reliable and reach higher miles than other vehicles. “While you may not want to depend on an average vehicle with 150,000 to take your family on a road trip, you won’t have to worry about taking a Toyota with that many miles,” she said.

Chevrolet

Chevrolet makes a wide range of vehicles at varying price points. “Some are budget-priced and others aren’t, “Musson said. “But those on a budget will find well-built engines and quality craftsmanship even on the lowest-cost models.

According to Musson, Chevy doesn’t skimp on its entry-level cars, and while entry-level vehicles don’t have all the expensive trim packages, the parts that keep it running and reliable are just as good as those in Chevrolet’s top-tier options.

Kia and Hyundai

Kia and Hyundai are known to be affordable and have decent quality, according to Pyle.

“I would not say they are high quality, but they are good quality,” Pyle said. The most affordable cars may not have all the bells and whistles, but Pyle explained that if you take care of the car, drive it right and maintain it well, they will last a long while without major repairs.

“The high-end models are nice too, but not for those on a budget,” Pyle explained. “I would stay away from the cheapest models, though. They are made cheap to be affordable but are plagued with problems.”

This insane collection of classic cars boasts an insane number of vintage muscle cars!

Classic car collectors have become very verbal about their vast vehicular exploits in recent years because of the rise in social media and the ability to show off the best of the automotive world. This has led to the discovery of some of the most incredible vintage vehicles ever to see the sales floor, and it would appear that a new automotive adventure is made every day. Of course, some of these finds have been pretty crazy, with cars ranging from the early 1900s and even some insane supercars from the modern world. However, very few collections can brag about their quantity as much as this glorious location can with over 1000 vehicles from virtually every year in American automotive history.

Some of the most fantastic cars on the list of extraordinary automobiles in the collection include the various Chevrolet Impalas, a couple of classic Firebirds consisting of the first and second generation, and a Ford Thunderbird, which has been called by the videographer the “Thunderchicken.” Unfortunately, it would appear that incredibly famous vehicles have been put through the wringer quite a few times as they are all covered in decades of dust and dirt which has been caked on in the hot summer sun and then locked onto the body by the frigid cold of winter.

This is generally the case for these vintage vehicles, as they have all been sitting in an open field for an unknown amount of time. These cars are currently for sale except for one Firebird with a houndstooth interior. It appears that this vehicle was made in the 1979-1980 production era, an exciting transition between generations. This Pontiac is not alone because it would appear that the brand is one of the most popular demographics in the collection. This vast collection is a massive stockpile of some of America’s most excellent classic cars within the confines of a truly gigantic piece of land.

Renault/dpa

Renault has announced that the highly anticipated R5 Turbo 3E will come with 547 bhp and be limited to 1,980 examples.

Under the bonnet, there is a 70-kWh lithium-ion battery pack and two electric motors, which the manufacturer claims can take the car over 400 km on a single charge. It boasts 800-volt technology too, allowing the car to be charged at speeds of up to 350 kW, allowing a 15 to 80% top up to be completed in 15 minutes.

In terms of acceleration, the Turbo 3E can do 0-100 km/h in under 3.5 seconds and will reach a top speed of 270 km/h.

Its exterior features deep front bumpers, flared wheel arches and a three-door bodystyle. At the front, there are square-shaped LED headlights and a front splitter. Down the side, large air intakes to help cool the brakes and to channel air around the wheels and under the lights.

Inside, the car is a strict two-seater. The dashboard includes a 10.1-inch driver’s display and a 10.25-inch infotainment screen. There are sports bucket seats with six-point seat belt harnesses, while the seats and dashboard are finished off in Alcantara.

Fabrice Cambolive, chief executive of Renault brand, said: “By creating the new category of electric ‘mini-supercars’ with the Renault 5 Turbo 3E, the Renault brand once again demonstrates the passion and spirit of boldness and innovation that has always driven it. This exuberant, over-excited model promises the best performance and sensations in just four metres of length, which is unprecedented in the market.”

He added: “With this car, Renault continues to make electric vehicles ever more desirable, further extending its ability to provide solutions for every need and every desire.”

Prices are yet to be revealed, but the car will go on sale in 2027 with reservations opening in the next few weeks. The price is expected to be significantly higher than the €24,900 or €38,700 that Renault has charged for previous R5 spin-offs.",yahoo
https://finance.yahoo.com,"GM's Recall of 90,000 Cars for Gearbox Issue Includes Camaros, Blackwings",https://autos.yahoo.com/gms-recall-90-000-cars-165100690.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:51:00 GMT","General Motors has issued a recall notice for more than 90,000 examples of the Chevrolet Camaro and Cadillac's CT4, CT5 and CT6 sedans to fix a transmission fault that could potentially cause the front wheels of the affected vehicles to lock up



The recall, which was announced on March 6, 2025, includes the 2020-2021 Cadillac CT4 and CT5 models — which, in CT4-V Blackwing and CT5-V Blackwing form, are among our favorites of the best four-door sports cars on sale today — the 2019-2020 Cadillac CT6, as well as 2020-2022 Chevrolet Camaros, and is centered around GM's 10-speed automatic transmission. Recall documents explain that a transmission control valve is liable to excess wear, eventually causing a loss of pressure via a fluid leak and then harsh shifting or even front wheel lock-up. Obviously, this potential leads to an increased risk of crashing, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says.

ERIC RYAN ANDERSON

The federal agency estimates that only 1% of the 90,081 units included in the recall will be affected by the issue. However, the fix is an essential one, GM explained in its recall filings. The beginning of the fix includes installing a new transmission control module software that monitors the performance of the valve. The software will lie dormant unless it detects excessive wear 10,000 miles before a potential wheel lock-up condition could occur, at which point it will limit the transmission to fifth gear, locking out the upper range of the 'box. GM says this is because the most likely wheel lock-up condition would be during a downshift from eighth gear.

Advertisement Advertisement

GM first took action around this issue in September 2024 after an internal brand quality manager submitted a report to GM's Speak Up for Safety program. The report claimed that a driver of a 2021 Cadillac CT5 had both front tires lock up while driving before the vehicle went into neutral. This specific model had to have its engine and front differential replaced. The chronology report goes on to say GM had previously investigated the issue but found that the likelihood of such instances was slim enough to prevent a recall. However, after the internal safety report, GM opened an investigation on November 21, 2024, and found 115 field reports by December.

Cadillac

The issue is isolated to the 2019-2022 model years because GM altered manufacturing parts during 2021 and 2022. Specifically, a new transmission control software was installed on 2023 model year Camaros and 2022 model year CT4 and CT5 units. Cadillac CT6 models were retrofitted with the software as early as 2021. In any event, this isolated issue could have been a much bigger headache for GM, especially if an internal safety report hadn't been filed. And as always... this recall also serves as a reminder to fit your car with a manual transmission if it's an option.

Every day since May 22, 2022 we have lived in fear of the awesome power wielded by the despicable Max Verstappen regime, until today. On a wet Sunday in Australia, after 1029 days living in the shadow of a Max Verstappen WDC leader, the despotic dictator was defeated in battle by the young Briton Lando Norris astride his trusty McLaren steed. No driver has ever spent as long leading the championship, and I hope that his reign of terror has come to its permanent end.

Across those 1,029 days Verstappen has won 39 Grands Prix, well over half the number that were held. In order to hold on to his championship lead across that much time Max needed to win the opening rounds in 2023 and 2024, which he did handily. It goes without saying that Max is a talented driver, and when he has the fastest car on the grid he can turn it into a championship. Red Bull, over the course of the season in 2024, put together the third-best team in the constructors' championship and he still managed to barely squeak the victory out after an extremely dominant open to the 2024 season. McLaren saw a late-season improvement well above and beyond what Red Bull had and took the constructors' championship as a result, and it seems the papaya team is still on its championship form. Will 2025 see the beginning of a dominant Lando Norris?

Norris Ready For His Turn At The Top

Lando Norris wins Australian Grand Prix - Clive Rose/Getty Images

In one of the sloppiest Formula One Grands Prix I have ever seen McLaren had a clear advantage keeping the car's tires from overheating, at one point growing Norris and teammate Oscar Piastri's lead over Verstappen to some 16-odd seconds around the Albert Park street circuit. With wet and drying and re-wetting conditions, it was a disastrously messy event that saw several drivers smash their cars into the wall and several strategies thrown out the window with a guess on the unpredictable weather. After the entire grid had switched onto slick tires to race on a drying track, the rain decided to come back and throw a wrench in the mix. Both McLarens, running first on the road, came to a wet patch and quickly slid off the road. Norris recovered with the lead intact, but Piastri was sidelined losing time trying to recover from the wet grass. In the end, Lando took home the F1 Grand Slam with pole position, fastest lap, and the race win. Six drivers, including four of the six rookies, failed to make it to the finish.

Verstappen will have to settle for second in the championship standings with 18 points to Norris' 25. This is the first time a McLaren driver has held the driver's title lead since Lewis Hamilton did at the 2012 Canadian Grand Prix. Max will get another opportunity to re-take the championship lead from Norris with the Chinese Grand Prix coming up on March 23. We have to do everything in our power to make sure that doesn't happen.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Tesla's Alleged Self-Driving Tech Defeated By YouTuber With Cartoon-Style Foam Wall,https://autos.yahoo.com/teslas-alleged-self-driving-tech-163344350.html,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:33:44 GMT","Even if you pay extra for Tesla's so-called ""Full Self-Driving"" software, no Tesla is actually capable of self-driving. The weird nerd you know who still wrongly believes Elon Musk personally invented the front trunk may disagree, but as ole Ben Shapiro loves to say, facts don't care about your feelings. Plus, while other companies use LIDAR on their self-driving prototypes, Tesla relies entirely on cameras.

Cameras are cheaper than LIDAR, but they also don't do all the same things, either. That's been known for a while, but in case you still need a demonstration of LIDAR's superiority, former NASA engineer and current YouTuber Mark Rober recently put both systems to the test.

While even a base Toyota Corolla offers adaptive cruise control and more advanced driver assistance than still comes standard on some luxury cars, passenger vehicles equipped with LIDAR are much less common. For that part of the test, Rober got some help from Luminar, the supplier Volvo uses for the LIDAR in the EX90. As for the Tesla, Rober used a Model Y that he personally owns. He then evaluated how well each vehicle handled tests meant to simulate a child standing in the road, a child running into the road, heavy fog, heavy rain, blinding lights and, in the ultimate test, a giant foam wall showing an image of the road behind it, Wile. E. Coyote-style.

The Tesla Obviously Lost

Obviously, the Tesla lost. There's simply no way cameras are going to outperform LIDAR, period. That doesn't mean the Tesla's cameras were useless, though. With the deceptively named ""Autopilot"" engaged, the Tesla was able to stop from 40 mph before hitting the stationary child-size mannequin, and also detected the same mannequin as it ""ran"" out from behind another car. The Luminar car equipped with LIDAR also stopped in time for both tests, leaving the two technologies tied going into round three.

The third test, however, is where LIDAR's superiority began to shine, and the limits of a camera-based system became apparent. While the lasers cut through the fog with no problem, the Tesla simply drove right through the mannequin. As for the torrential downpour test, while the wall of water initially hid the mannequin from the LIDAR, it still detected it in time to come to a stop safely. Considering how those tests went, it would have also made sense if the Tesla failed the blinding lights test, but it actually did manage to spot the mannequin just in time.

The most interesting challenge, of course, was the foam wall made to look like the road behind it, just like in those old Road Runner cartoons. Would the Tesla's cameras pick up on the obstacle in its path and stop just like the LIDAR car? Of course not. After passing the blinding light test, you could be forgiven for thinking there was a chance, but nope: It just plowed right through. It probably isn't something you'll ever encounter in real life, but it still does a great job of highlighting just how flawed Tesla's camera-only approach is.

The Weird Nerds Are Mad

Mark Rober Tesla Autopilot LIDAR Full Self-Driving Crash Test - Mark Rober/YouTube

As you can imagine, those convinced Tesla is on the verge of solving autonomy and becoming a $5 trillion company by selling a humanoid robot to every human on Earth — all very real things Musk has actually promised on earnings calls with investors — are not happy with a famous YouTuber broadcasting even more evidence to the world that a camera-only system is inferior. They're saying it was unfair to use Autopilot instead of Full Self-Driving, as if more software could make up for the inherent limitations of a camera system. They're arguing humans drive using a vision-only system known as our eyes, as if that's proof LIDAR isn't superior. They're saying he must have faked the results and not used Autopilot at all. Basically, they're throwing anything they can think of at the wall and hoping it sticks.

Now, I wasn't there. I didn't witness Rober's testing in person and can't provide conclusive evidence that he didn't cheat in any way. And even if I could, it's not like the Tesla zealots would accept it from someone who's been on the record for years saying Autopilot is bad — a position I still hold to this day. However, Rober isn't some part-time YouTuber with a few thousand subscribers, a day job selling tires and no real assets of any kind. He has more than 65 million subscribers and likely makes substantial money from his channel. He has assets that can be used to satisfy a legal judgment. If Tesla believes this video was deceptively edited to defame the automaker, it has every right to, and absolutely should, sue Mark Rober.

If Tesla sues and wins, then we'll have our proof. Until then, the question stands: If this video really is deceptive and inaccurate, why hasn't Tesla sued yet?

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,Bitcoin Covenants: What Are They And What Do They Do?,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/featured/bitcoin-covenants-what-are-they-and-what-do-they-do,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 14:36:24 GMT","Covenant : a usually formal, solemn, and binding agreement.

This word has become one of the most charged words in the Bitcoin space. They’re the best thing since sliced bread. They’re the most dangerous thing since the atom bomb. They aren’t really going to do anything to scale Bitcoin, but they’re neat.

Everyone has a completely different attitude towards them. We have the pro-faction, the anti-faction, the ambivalent faction. To make matters worse, covenant is frankly a very vague term in its description of mature and concrete proposals to the protocol that would be classified as covenants.

The degrees of difference between the functionality of different proposals that have been put forward is enormous. Some of them create entirely new design spaces for what it is possible to build on top of Bitcoin, while others strictly speaking don’t add any new functionality at all, they simply optimize things that are already currently possible with a large degree of complexity and overhead.

Let’s create a new definition specific to Bitcoin.

Covenant : any script that guarantees some, or all, of the outputs created by a transaction spending an input with a covenant script will have to fit certain specified criteria for the spending transaction to be consensus valid.

So in less strict terms, if a Bitcoin script currently restricts who can spend a coin by demanding an authorization proof, i.e. a cryptographic signature, or when it can be spent, i.e. after a timelock expires or the spender can show the preimage to a hash, a covenant script restricts how it can be spent, i.e. to who, how much to which person, etc. A covenant script can even restrict a coin so that it must be spent to another covenant script.

That last part is the core of what has made covenant such a contentious word. Many people have large reservations about adding a new way to “lock” bitcoins that can self-propagate and ensure future coins are restricted in a similar fashion. Many people have concerns about this being used to damage fungibility or institute censorship regimes.

I feel it necessary to point out that both of these things can be accomplished right now, with no covenant script capability, simply by using multisig. Any authority can refuse to allow withdrawals to be processed from exchanges unless they are to a 2-of-2 multisig where that authority holds one key. From there they can simply refuse to sign transactions sending to addresses where they do not hold a required key, and establish whatever blacklist or whitelist scheme they desired opaquely and entirely off-chain.

That said, it is still important for Bitcoin users to have a grasp and understanding of the difference of power and flexibility between all the different covenant proposals that currently exist.

There are two core things that covenants seek to enable in order to apply restrictions to how coins are spent, introspection and forward data carrying.

Introspection is the ability to inspect different parts of the transaction that is being evaluated while trying to spend a specific coin. So for instance, if you want to restrict a coin so that it has to be spent to a specific address, you have to be able to compare the address specified in the input’s covenant script to the address specified in the output of the transaction spending it. Opcodes that enable introspection are ones that give us the ability to compare different parts of the spending transaction against restrictions included in the script being evaluated. The more granular you can get with introspection concerning which particular parts of a transaction you can examine, the more powerful it becomes.

Forward data carrying is related to introspection, and in many ways a consequence of it, that allows you to ensure some piece of information is carried forward and included in each new covenant script so that it can be used in the next evaluation of the covenant script. This is accomplished by using introspection to restrict certain parts of the transaction so tightly that they must include the exact desired data or they are invalid. The more powerful introspective capability you have, the more flexibly you can carry data forward, and the more flexibly you can use that data.

This is just the first introduction to a series of articles to come over the next few weeks looking at all the major covenant proposals that are in a mature state, have received recent interest, or are conceptually critically important enough that developers agree on their usefulness but not yet a concrete design. This won’t be 100% complete, but it will be relatively comprehensive. A few of them also are not strictly covenants per se, but compose very tightly with them.

Bitcoin has come a long way since trading at just $5.34 on Saint Patrick’s Day in 2012. Now, in 2025, the world’s largest digital currency has reached $83,223 on this holiday, marking a staggering 1,558,000% increase in just 13 years. With institutional adoption surging and supply remaining fixed, Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory appears stronger than ever.

A Look at Bitcoin’s Explosive Growth

Bitcoin’s price movements in the early years was anything but predictable. In just one year, from 2012 to 2013, BTC skyrocketed 780%, reaching $47. The next year, it surged again to $630, a 1,240% increase from 2013.

However, Bitcoin’s price swings have been sharp. By 2015, it had retraced to $290, but by 2017, it climbed to $1,180, and in just one more year, it hit $8,321—a 605% increase. Even after a pullback to $4,047 in 2019, the next five years saw Bitcoin go from $5,002 in 2020 to $83,223 in 2025.

2012 $5.34

2013: $47

2014: $630

2022: $41,140

2023: $26,876

2024: $68,845

2025: $83,223

Why Bitcoin’s Price Keeps Rising

Despite its volatility, Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains upward, driven by increasing demand and fixed supply. Unlike fiat currencies, which governments can print indefinitely, Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins. As more individuals, institutions, and even governments adopt Bitcoin, scarcity drives prices higher.

Several major factors are contributing to Bitcoin’s growing adoption in the last year:

The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – United States Senator Cynthia Lummis and Congressman Nick Begich both introduced legislation to green light the U.S. to purchase 1,000,000 BTC for their strategic reserves, further solidifying its legitimacy and causing other countries potential FOMO in.

Corporate Adoption – Companies like Strategy, Metaplanet, and Rumble continue adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, treating it as a strategic reserve asset.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs – The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the U.S. has opened the floodgates for institutional investment, allowing hedge funds, pension funds, and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through regulated financial products.These ETFs have collectively purchased over 1 million BTC.

Halving – On April 19th, 2024, Bitcoin underwent its fourth halving event, where the block reward for those mining Bitcoin was cut in half from 6.25 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block. This decrease in the amount of daily new bitcoin issued on the market historically leads to an increase in the price of BTC. Bitcoin halvings occur roughly every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years).

What’s Next?

With demand skyrocketing and supply shrinking due to upcoming Bitcoin halvings, Bitcoin seems poised to continue its historic rise in price. If history is any indicator, the best time to buy Bitcoin was years ago—the second-best time might be today.",bitcoinmagazine

JUST IN: 🇰🇷 South Korea’s central bank dismisses establishing a Strategic #Bitcoin Reserve



Says its “price volatility is very high” 👀 pic.twitter.com/CppD3nvC52 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 17, 2025

In response to an inquiry from a member of the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee, the central bank rejected adding bitcoin to its reserves. BOK officials emphasized bitcoin’s wild price swings as a key deterrent, stating that transaction costs to convert bitcoin to cash “could rise drastically” if the market experiences instability.

As of March 17th, bitcoin trades around $83,500, having fallen 23% from its peak of $108,000 in January. The BOK warned that this extreme volatility poses significant risks to its reserves.

The bank also indicated that bitcoin fails to meet the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) criteria for reserve assets. The IMF calls for prudent management of liquidity, market, and credit risks for reserves – standards bitcoin does not currently satisfy in the eyes of the BOK.

This latest stance marks the first time the South Korean central bank has directly addressed the possibility of using bitcoin as a reserve asset. It emphasized a “cautious approach” regarding bitcoin.

The dismissal of a strategic bitcoin reserve comes despite growing attention on crypto’s potential role in reserves globally. Earlier in March, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve.

January 26: Admission & Request for Content Removal

ExtraVOD claimed ignorance of the policy but admitted to creating a second account for high-frequency trading. BYDFi requested the removal of misleading content from his social media.

January 28-29: Agreement & Fund Transfers

Following negotiations, an agreement was reached. All funds in ExtraVOD’s main account remained fully accessible, while deposit funds from the sub-account were merged into the main account.

ExtraVOD acknowledged the resolution and publicly confirmed it. Over the next month, he continued trading actively.

March 1 – March 5: Contradictory Claims & Renewed Demands

A month later, ExtraVOD re-engaged, demanding profit funds from the sub-account.

BYDFi support reiterated that, per the January agreement, all deposited funds had already been returned to the main account.

March 11-15: Threats & Misinformation

ExtraVOD escalated the situation, threatening to expose the issue on social media unless his demands were met. He altered his stance, now claiming the second account belonged to his family.

He then released a video urging his followers to pressure BYDFi into returning the funds.

5 Years. 1 Principle: Rules > Followers

BYDFi upholds integrity and transparency to ensure a fair trading environment for all users. All legitimate funds were returned to ExtraVOD’s verified account, but trading profits were voided due to rule violations.

BYDFi will not tolerate defamatory actions and reserves the right to take legal action against any damages caused by misleading claims. The misuse of multiple accounts to bypass risk limits is a violation of policies across all trading platforms.

https://cryptobriefing.com,Standard Chartered reduce pronóstico de Ether a $4K,https://es.cryptobriefing.com/pronostico-del-precio-de-ether-a-fin-de-ano/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:21:37 GMT","El banco indicó que las soluciones de segunda capa están atrayendo usuarios y actividad lejos de la red principal de Ethereum.

Conclusiones Clave Standard Chartered redujo su objetivo de fin de año para Ether a $4,000 debido a un declive estructural.

Las blockchains de segunda capa han contribuido a la reducción de la capitalización de mercado de Ether en $50 mil millones.

Compartir este artículo

Standard Chartered predijo que Ethereum podría alcanzar los $10,000 para finales de 2025 en un pronóstico realizado en enero. Ahora, el banco ha revisado su objetivo de fin de año para el activo digital, reduciéndolo en un 60%.

Según un informe publicado hoy, el ajuste se basa en la observación de Standard Chartered de que Ethereum enfrenta una creciente competencia por parte de soluciones de segunda capa, destacando a Base. Además, la reciente actualización de Ethereum, denominada Dencun, no ayuda a la red a mantener su dominio en el mercado.

Standard Chartered declaró que Ethereum sigue liderando en muchas métricas clave de blockchain, pero su dominio ha disminuido con el tiempo.

Las blockchains de segunda capa, originalmente diseñadas para ayudar a Ethereum mejorando la escalabilidad y reduciendo las tarifas de transacción, han desplazado valor económico fuera de Ethereum, señaló el informe.

El modelo de Base de compartir ganancias con su propietario, Coinbase, es considerado una estrategia competitiva particularmente efectiva. Standard Chartered estima que ha provocado una disminución de $50 mil millones en la capitalización de mercado de Ethereum y espera que esta tendencia a la baja continúe.

«Ether está en una encrucijada,» dijo el informe, señalando que aunque «todavía domina en varias métricas,» este dominio ha estado declinando.

A pesar de los desafíos continuos, Standard Chartered ve la tokenización de activos del mundo real como un potencial motor de crecimiento para Ethereum.

Según el banco, el sólido marco de seguridad de Ethereum podría permitirle mantener un 80% de participación de mercado en este sector emergente, lo que podría estabilizar o incluso revertir su declive estructural.

Geoff Kendrick, jefe de investigación de activos digitales en Standard Chartered, sugiere que «un cambio proactivo de dirección comercial por parte de la Fundación Ethereum,» como gravar las soluciones de segunda capa, podría ayudar a contrarrestar la continua pérdida de valor hacia estas redes. Sin embargo, cree que la EF es poco probable que cambie su modelo de negocio.

Standard Chartered pronostica que la relación ETH/BTC caerá a 0.015 para finales de 2027, lo que marcaría su nivel más bajo desde 2017.

Aunque el banco espera que el precio de Ether se recupere de los niveles actuales debido a un repunte más amplio liderado por Bitcoin que elevará todos los activos digitales, mantiene que Ether seguirá rindiendo por debajo.

El año pasado, Standard Chartered proyectó que Ethereum alcanzaría los $8,000 para finales del año en curso y $14,000 para finales de 2025.

Los analistas del banco creían que el catalizador principal para estos aumentos de precio sería la aprobación de ETFs spot de Ethereum en EEUU. También consideraron la actualización de Dencun como otro factor positivo que contribuye al potencial crecimiento del precio de Ethereum.

A principios de este año, Standard Chartered predijo que Ethereum podría alcanzar los $10,000 para finales de 2025 como resultado de un ambiente favorable para el crecimiento cripto bajo la nueva administración.

Ethereum se cotizaba alrededor de $1,900 en el momento de la prensa, subiendo ligeramente en las últimas 24 horas, según TradingView. El activo digital ha bajado alrededor del 42% en lo que va de año y sigue estando un 60% por debajo de su máximo histórico.

La próxima gran actualización de Ethereum es la actualización Pectra, que está programada para entrar en vigor en la red principal de Ethereum el próximo mes. Esta actualización tiene como objetivo mejorar el rendimiento de la red, mejorar la participación de los validadores e introducir varias características clave como EIP-7702 y EIP-7251.",cryptobriefing

SUPERTRADE is a new global owner trading platform. In the last development, the company has officially launched a new platform presenting new opportunities for traders around the world to access substantial capital without risking its own funds. With a transparent approach to owner trading, Supertrade offers two flexible financing models: the 2 -phase challenge and instant financing, allowing traders to ensure financed accounts up to $ 100,000.

The launch of the SuperTrade platform is designed to break the traditional barriers in the owner trading industry, enabling aspiring and professional traders to climb their trading potential through accessible and structured financing models. The platform seeks to promote financial growth while promoting disciplined risk management.

SUPERTRADE offers two clearly differentiated financing options adapted to different experiences and objectives of traders:

2 phase challenge: This method is designed for traders to demonstrate their skills through a two -step evaluation process. In phase 1, traders must reach a benefit objective of 8% while adhere to strict risks of risk management, including a daily withdrawal of 5% and a total withdrawal of 10%. Successful completion leads to phase 2, where traders must ensure a 10% benefit objective with a total reduced to 7%. Once both phases are completed, traders earn access to financed accounts up to $ 100,000.

Instant financing: For traders anxious to start operating with real capital, SuperTrade offers instant financing accounts ranging from $ 500 to $ 100,000 for a unique non -refundable rate. This approach eliminates the need for evaluation phases, allowing traders to start immediately and remove profits as they get them.

With a competitive super -trace pricing model, traders have total transparency with respect to the costs and terms of financing. The platform also ensures that all the challenge rates were reimbursed in the first successful trader payment.

A fundamental aspect of trading in Supertrade is its firm commitment to sustainable trading practices. When imposing clear 5% daily withdrawal limits and 10% in total, the platform ensures that traders develop disciplined and profitable trading strategies. This strategic risk management approach places traders in a long -term success path while minimizing potential losses.

Additionally, Supertrade provides traders up to 1: 100 leverage, allowing them to optimize their trading strategies through several financial markets, including Forex, cryptocurrencies, metals and indices.

SUPERTRADE extends its services beyond the provision of capital offering comprehensive educational support through its SuperTrade Academy. Traders can access deep learning resources to sharpen their trading skills, including market analysis, trading strategies and risk management techniques.

Supertrade keeps its users informed through its SuperTrade blog and the news section, ensuring that traders remain up to date with market trends, platform updates and industry news.

In addition, the company pays significant attention to its interaction with users through social networks. Superstrade communities on Twitter, Telegram and Discord not only serve a communicative and informative purpose, but also regularly organize a variety of activities for the commitment and motivation of users.

To promote global growth, legal superhrade operates under a regulated framework to ensure compliance and safety for all traders. In addition, the platform plans to introduce an association program, allowing individuals and businesses to gain life commissions when referring to new traders to Superstrade.

As part of its super -trace growth vision, the company aims to expand its presence through multiple global regions, offering localized support and personalized solutions for traders. Future developments will also introduce advanced trading tools and new financing options to meet the evolutionary demands of the trading community.

About the company - SUPERTRARD

Supertrade is a global owner trading platform built to empower traders by providing access to substantial trading capital.

https://decrypt.co,Canary Capital Files Application With SEC for SUI-Based ETF,https://decrypt.co/310231/canary-capital-files-application-for-sui-etf,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 20:11:31 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Canary Capital filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a SUI exchange-traded fund, roughly a week after a Trump-linked decentralized finance project added the token to its reserves.

“We’ve seen a significant migration of developers into the SUI ecosystem, and given the chain’s speed and efficiency, we believe it is primed for substantial future adoption,” Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg told Decrypt in an email.

The filing comes roughly two weeks after Canary Capital registered a Delaware Trust entity for a SUI ETF—the first step to creating an investment vehicle tracking the altcoin's price. In its application, the firm did not name the exchange on which its SUI ETF, if approved, would trade.

Canary Capital's push to launch a SUI ETF comes 10 days after the Trump-affiliated World Liberty Fi collective announced its deal with the token's issuer, Sui Network. Under the agreement, WLFI will add SUI to its reserves and explore product development opportunities with the layer-1 blockchain.

The Nashville-based firm's bid to offer a SUI-based investment vehicle comes amid a broad push by issuers to secure approvals for a variety of digital asset-based investment products from securities regulators that have softened their stances on cryptocurrencies under newly elected President Donald Trump. Amid that increasingly crypto-friendly regulatory environment, asset managers such as VanEck, 21 Shares and Franklin Templeton have filed to offer Solana and XRP ETFs, among other digital asset-based products.

Joining the fray, Canary Capital has filed to launch several ETFs based on blue-chip cryptocurrencies and altcoins over the past few months. Last fall, the investment firm submitted S-1 forms for Litecoin and HBAR ETFs to the SEC. And, more recently, the firm has made progress on its petitions to roll out funds tracking the prices of Solana and XRP.

SUI was recently trading at $2.36 on Monday, up 5.1% in the past 24 hours, according to digital asset data provider CoinGecko. The token is the 23rd largest cryptocurrency with a market value of more than $7.4 billion, the same data shows.

https://decrypt.co,DOGE Lord Elon Musk Claims US Runs 'Magic Money Computers',https://decrypt.co/310211/doge-lord-elon-musk-us-magic-money-computers,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 19:06:56 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Elon Musk’s cost-cutting crusade within the U.S. government has purportedly identified computers that can print unlimited amounts of cash, the billionaire claimed in a podcast published on Monday.

“I call a ‘magic money computer’ any computer which can just make money out of thin air,” Musk told Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) during the ""Verdict"" podcast sit-down. “They just send money out of nothing.”

The computers identified by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, exist at multiple agencies, Musk added, pointing to the U.S. Treasury Department, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of State, and U.S. Department of Defense.

Musk claimed his team has found 14 computers with blank-check authority at the federal government, and suggested that they routinely send trillions of dollars to keep Washington up and running.

While Musk’s fixation on government spending has been brewing for months, his latest comments on the government’s payment powers alarmed Bitcoin fans who have long viewed it as a hedge against currency degradation.

In 2013, the term “magic internet money” became popularized within Bitcoin’s community after a Reddit user created a viral ad using the slogan. The meme’s crudely illustrated mascot has since become the central focus of Taproot Wizards’ line of Bitcoin-based collectibles.

Bitcoin’s portrayal as a store of value has often been linked to money-printing. Generally, Bitcoiners believe a government can create as much cash as it wants, while Bitcoin’s supply will never exceed 21 million BTC due to the way that its software was coded.

The sentiment has been echoed by influential figures on Wall Street, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. In January, he said Bitcoin appeals to investors fearful of their local currency being debased through government spending, describing Bitcoin as “a currency of fear.”

Musk’s attempts to slash costs have contributed to recession fears, as market participants weigh how federal jobs cuts could affect economic growth and consumer spending. However, the accuracy of DOGE’s purported spending cuts has faced scrutiny.

As news publications have identified errors in DOGE's savings claims, the cost-cutting team has progressively made data posted to the DOGE website—where Dogecoin’s logo was recently added and then swiftly removed—harder to decipher, according to The New York Times.

Musk has said DOGE will “act quickly to correct any mistakes,” but recent savings claims have been made with less data for identifying which contracts have purportedly been cut.

Musk took issue with the government’s spending procedures in the podcast published on Monday, but he acknowledged the magic machines are “not totally wrong” in terms of how much money is being spent compared to what's reported. In terms of the amount they spend, they’re “probably off” by up to 10% in some cases, he claimed.

https://decrypt.co,Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Will Underpin New Financial Architecture: Coinshift CEO,https://decrypt.co/310194/yield-bearing-stablecoins-will-underpin-new-financial-architecture-coinshift-ceo,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 17:57:43 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

The lines between stablecoins, lending and banking are blurring, leading to the emergence of new financial primitives, according to Tarun Gupta, CEO of payments and accounting solution Coinshift.

In a video interview with Decrypt, Gupta elaborated on his thesis, explaining that this emerging financial architecture would be underpinned by yield-bearing stablecoins like Coinshift’s own csUSDL.

“For the past six or seven years, stablecoins have solved one simple use case, which is money,” Gupta explained. “Today, you can basically make the movement of money faster, cheaper and better with stablecoins. However, they're not solving any kind of yield use case or lending use case.”

Stablecoins' ""architecture of promises""

Yield-bearing stablecoins, which enable holders to receive passive income while maintaining the stability of fiat-pegged tokens, build on the “architecture of promises” underpinning verifiable on-chain assets, Gupta said.

“How I see this is, you need a trust layer, and then you need a transparent layer on top,” he said. “Once you combine these two layers with the power of smart contracts and blockchain, you end up having a lot of convergence between banking, lending and yield mechanisms.”

Based on that thesis, Coinshift launched csUSDL. “Can you combine a USDC-like stablecoin from the real world, which is Paxos’ USDL, and then use it to lend on a platform like Aave?” Gupta said. Coinshift’s csUSDL leverages “permissionless market creation system” Morpho Protocol, which enables the creation of verifiable markets, alongside the provably collateralized USDL.

The onchain economy is evolving, and with it, the way individuals and businesses manage their portfolios & treasuries. Meet csUSDL: the first Liquid Lending Token (LLT) backed by a RWA. Secured by the best, csUSDL delivers institutional-grade yield, security, and transparency. pic.twitter.com/PtZ5iBLmM7 — Coinshift (@0xCoinshift) November 21, 2024

The end user, he explained, is “trusting this entire promise of, once you hold csUSDL, you will get one USDL against that, and you don't need to trust Coinshift for that,” he said. Instead, users place their trust in a protocol, a smart contract layer and ultimately the provably verifiable blockchain. “This financial architecture is way better than what we have in TradFi,” Gupta said. “Once we have this architecture, the thesis is that every other instrument will move on-chain,” he explained, bringing trillions of dollars in value with it.

Regulatory clarity

For that to happen, as well as the technology being in place, regulations have to catch up. Crypto-friendly jurisdictions like that of Abu Dhabi are “setting examples for other governments on how you can innovate with new technology,” Gupta said. In the U.S. the proposed GENIUS Act is putting the nation on “the right path,” he added, with institutions able to “use a specific stablecoin issuer because it’s regulated and supervised.”

The proposed legislation “brings lots of clarity,” while its rules on reserve management “ensures more trust” to end users like institutions, he said, adding that he is “100% confident” that institutions and neobanks will adopt stablecoins.

As a result, there’s now “no reason to use the old banking infrastructure to move money,” he said, adding that other fintechs like payroll providers will also migrate to stablecoins. In the future, he explained, “all fintechs will actually outcompete banks with stablecoins like USDC.”

SHIFT work

In the increasingly crowded stablecoin field, Gupta said, those with “the largest liquidity, deep integrations, and distribution” are poised to win.

For its part, Coinshift is focusing on two key areas. First, the launch of its SHIFT reward and governance token, which has two purposes: to reward the TVL of Coinshift’s cs-focused assets, and to regulate its ecosystem.

Second, the company aims to grow csUSDL adoption by playing on its yield-bearing proposition. In the short term, that means driving the stablecoin’s market cap to $100 million through “majorly large institutions,” Gupta said. “If you’re already holding USDC, you should think about holding csUSDL, because the risk is on the lowest side, and the secondary liquidity is also very high,” he explained.

As well as increasing secondary liquidity “so that people always stay in csUSDL,” the next stage of Coinshift’s plan is to fully integrate csUSDL into its platform, “to offer it to all our clients, especially b2b organizations,” Gupta said. In addition, Coinshift plans to work with DeFi protocols to “have it as collateral or become a reserve for other stablecoins.”

Already csUSDL has “15-plus DeFi integrations on day one,” Gupta said, explaining that, “At the end of the day, we’re building this underlying blueprint for making these yield-bearing instruments more liquid in DeFi, and it should be deeply integrated.”

https://decrypt.co,TON Spikes 29% After Telegram Founder Pavel Durov Is Allowed to Leave France,https://decrypt.co/310173/ton-spikes-29-telegram-founder-pavel-durov,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 17:28:05 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

TON, the native token of The Open Network layer-1 blockchain, is up 29% on the week after a surge that followed a change in Telegram CEO and co-founder Pavel Durov’s bail conditions, allowing him to leave France for Dubai.

The token, now trading at $3.46, has posted the largest weekly gain among top 100 crypto assets according to data from CoinGecko. The jump represents a sizable increase relative to the performance of the leading crypto assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, which each moved around 5% on the week—Bitcoin rose to $83,717, while Ethereum dropped to $1,922.

“As you may have heard, I’ve returned to Dubai after spending several months in France due to an investigation related to the activity of criminals on Telegram,” Durov posted to 11.9 million subscribers of his personal Telegram channel. “The process is ongoing, but it feels great to be home.”

The messaging app founder was indicted on charges in August 2024, alleging that Telegram facilitated criminal activity on the app, and was barred from leaving France as a result. Now, though, investigative judges have allowed him to return to his home in Dubai for a short period of time.

While Telegram and The Open Network operate independently, they both originated from the same team—and continue to be closely intertwined. Telegram co-founders Pavel and Nikolai Durov created TON under its original name of Telegram Open Network, but abandoned plans for the chain in 2020 amid regulatory scrutiny.

Development continued externally, and over the last two years, Telegram has increasingly embraced TON for capabilities like paying channel operators a share of ad revenue. Earlier this year, Telegram and TON inked an exclusive partnership that ensured Telegram mini apps (including games) with crypto connections must utilize TON moving forward.

The Open Network and Telegram made significant strides with crypto user adoption last year, with mini apps helping to spur Telegram monthly active user numbers to more than 950 million as of June 2024. The NOT token of Notcoin, the first play-to-earn game on Telegram, surged to a market cap of nearly $3 billion soon after launch last summer.

At its current price, TON is the 16th largest crypto by market cap according to CoinGecko. However, the token is down 58% off its all-time high of $8.25 established last June. TON plunged last August amid news of Durov’s arrest, with many TON project builders protesting and speaking out against the detention.

Victoria, Seychelles, March 17th, 2025, Chainwire

Recently, BYDFi has noticed misleading accusations made by the content creator ExtraVOD on social media against BYDFi. To ensure transparency and clarity for all users, BYDFi would like to present the facts of the situation：

January 25: Detection of Abnormal Trading Activity

When ExtraVOD’s first account reached the perpetual risk limit, he opened a second account to bypass restrictions. BYDFi identified abnormal trading activities and ExtraVOD was reminded of BYDFi’s User Agreement (9.2 and 9.3) and the risk limits for perpetual contracts.

January 26: Admission & Request for Content Removal

ExtraVOD claimed ignorance of the policy but admitted to creating a second account for high-frequency trading. BYDFi requested the removal of misleading content from his social media.

January 28-29: Agreement & Fund Transfers

Following negotiations, an agreement was reached. All funds in ExtraVOD’s main account remained fully accessible, while deposit funds from the sub-account were merged into the main account.

ExtraVOD acknowledged the resolution and publicly confirmed it. Over the next month, he continued trading actively.

March 1 - March 5: Contradictory Claims & Renewed Demands

A month later, ExtraVOD re-engaged, demanding profit funds from the sub-account.

BYDFi support reiterated that, per the January agreement, all deposited funds had already been returned to the main account.

March 11-15: Threats & Misinformation

ExtraVOD escalated the situation, threatening to expose the issue on social media unless his demands were met. He altered his stance, now claiming the second account belonged to his family.

He then released a video urging his followers to pressure BYDFi into returning the funds.

5 Years. 1 Principle: Rules > Followers

BYDFi upholds integrity and transparency to ensure a fair trading environment for all users. All legitimate funds were returned to ExtraVOD’s verified account, but trading profits were voided due to rule violations.

BYDFi will not tolerate defamatory actions and reserves the right to take legal action against any damages caused by misleading claims. The misuse of multiple accounts to bypass risk limits is a violation of policies across all trading platforms.

https://decrypt.co,RAAC Launches Testnet for $235m Gold-Backed RWA Platform,https://decrypt.co/310123/raac-launches-testnet-for-235m-gold-backed-rwa-platform,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:06:28 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Tortola, British Virgin Islands, March 17th, 2025, Chainwire

RAAC, a decentralized Real World Asset (RWA) lending and borrowing ecosystem, is announcing the launch of its testnet today in the face of strong institutional demand. This has helped the project secure $235 million in gold-backed deposits at launch from one of the largest gold reserves in North America, as it pursues opportunities in US rental property and more.

Grounded in the $1.8 billion Curve ecosystem, RAAC is a member of the Chainlink Build program and has been incubated by The LLamas – a DeFi community that supports, builds, and promotes Curve ecosystem growth.

Curve founder and RAAC advisor Michael Egorov says: “Most value in crypto is driven by DeFi and payments. However, as for DeFi, this value is currently derived mostly from crypto speculation. We need projects like RAAC to go beyond our crypto bubble, realize the true potential of programmable, decentralized money, and eventually have the global financial system naturally re-architected.""

Initially, RAAC will develop protocols integrating gold-backed and real estate-backed tokens from asset owners through Instruxi – a leading institutional tokenization provider that serves both the digital and traditional asset space. These asset owners include Pretio DeFi Solutions, which, with its partners, has secured a contract with the North Terrace Mining Project in British Columbia to acquire 1 million troy ounces of proven gold reserves for tokenization.

At the time of tokenization, these reserves are valued at approximately $400 million—20% of a discounted spot price of $2,000 per troy ounce. Over a 10 to 15-year production cycle, once the gold is extracted, refined, and securely stored, the tokenized asset’s total estimated value could reach up to $3 billion, depending on market conditions and future gold prices.

RAAC founder Kevin Rusher says: “RAAC has been in the works for a long time. This is not something we wanted to rush. Our team believes passionately in increasing access to the world’s most stable assets in one of the world’s most volatile sectors. We will achieve all this and more with RAAC. We don't want to bring the next billion users into decentralized finance, but the next $100 billion.”

The tokenization process will transform these proven gold reserves into fractional digital assets, which will be deposited into the Pretio Foundation DAO. The DAO Treasury will manage a comprehensive digital ecosystem that leverages on-chain liquidity and advanced DeFi protocols from the RAAC ecosystem.

This ecosystem will operate via stablecoins minted by the Pretio Treasury, initially backed by the gold reserves—and later by additional precious metals. At RAAC’s launch, Pretio will contribute an initial $235 million in treasury assets, with further assets to be added to the ecosystem over time.

Pier S. Bjorklund, manager of Pretio DeFi Solutions, remarks: ""The North Terrace Mining Project exemplifies our commitment to innovation. Pretio DeFi and our partners are setting a new standard by seamlessly integrating traditional gold mining with state-of-the-art blockchain, decentralized finance technologies, and sustainable mining practices.""

Mathew Harrowing, co-founder of Instruxi, adds: “One of the biggest issues RWA tokenization faced was on-chain liquidity. RAAC solves that elegantly while providing a vehicle for asset holders and traditional finance institutions to get credible exposure to the DeFi market with a stable and predictable yield. It’s truly game-changing.”

RAAC’s testnet is available to non-US persons and will be followed by a closed beta. Currently, the Ethereum mainnet launch and Token Generation Event are scheduled for Q2.

*RAAC is only available in a limited number of jurisdictions and is not available to US persons*

About RAAC

RAAC is a decentralized lending and borrowing ecosystem that is widening participation in tokenized Real World Assets like real estate and gold. The platform allows users to borrow against their holdings at competitive rates, while also offering investors access to high-value arbitrage opportunities. Providing a bridge between traditional and decentralized finance, RAAC is modernizing the way investors can access and profit from the world’s most stable assets.

A historic bleed for digital asset investment products stretched into its fifth week, as products tracked by CoinShares lost $1.7 billion, the crypto investment firm said on Monday.

Exchange-traded products holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are now facing their worst stretch of outflows on record, totaling $6.4 billion since Feb. 7, CoinShares said in a report.

As President Donald Trump's tariffs continued driving trade tensions and inflation concerns, Bitcoin funds were hit particularly hard, per CoinShares’ report. Investors yanked $978 million from Bitcoin funds last week as the asset’s price fell to a four-month low of $77,000.

Bitcoin’s price has since reclaimed $83,000, but “a lot of resistance” from last week’s low suggests more pain lies ahead, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt.

“I think we are close to the bottom,” Butterfill said, adding that the pace of outflows may soon weaken. “It’s to say that’s happened just yet, but we might be close to peak bearishness.”

On Friday, the University of Michigan’s latest consumer survey showed sentiment plunging to its lowest level since November 2022 amid Trump’s erratic tariff approach.

Butterfill suggested that deteriorating consumer sentiment in the U.S. may prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates soon, buoying crypto prices as borrowing becomes cheaper.

After tilting toward “Extreme Fear,” or a value of 20 last week, the Fear and Greed Index, a measure of investor sentiment, has since climbed back to “Fear,” or a value of 32, as of Monday morning Eastern.

Prediction market traders on MYRIAD foresee an 80% chance that optimism will persist, and the index will be above 30 on Tuesday. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt’s parent company, DASTAN.)

The U.S. central bank will hold its latest policy meeting this week. While officials are widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, the Fed will release a series of updated projections touching on key metrics like employment and inflation.

Last week’s inflation figures came in soft, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. However, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, won’t be updated until after the conclusion of the Fed’s meeting on Thursday.

https://decrypt.co,Ethereum Price Will Continue 'Structural Decline' in 2025: Standard Chartered,https://decrypt.co/310147/ethereum-price-structural-decline-standard-chartered,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:53:59 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

After hitting multi-year lows in recent weeks, an analyst at UK bank Standard Chartered expects the Ethereum price to continue its ""structural decline"" by the end of of the year. As such, SC has revised its 2025 price target from $10,000 to $4,000.

Geoff Kendrick, Global Head of Digital Assets Research at the company expects the ETH-to-BTC ratio, which has hit historic lows in recent months, to slowly decline until the end of 2027.

This means that even if Ethereum goes up in absolute terms, it will increasingly lag Bitcoin by market cap, he wrote in a new market note shared with Decrypt.

Kendrick largely pointed the finger at the rise of Ethereum Layer-2 networks as part of the reason for its relative dominance slipping away, using Coinbase’s Base blockchain as the main example.

A Layer-2 is an off-chain network built on top of a blockchain to help extend its capabilities. Aside from Base, other Ethereum Layer-2s include Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync Era, Polygon zkEVM.

The analyst estimated that Base has removed $50 billion from ETH’s market cap. Kendrick argues this is because when users make transactions on these L2s instead of the original Ethereum network, fees go to organizations other than the Ethereum Foundation (such as Coinbase), reducing the fees it receives.

Kendrick argued that these lower fees directly impact the price of ETH, as it lowers the ""GDP"" of the Ethereum blockchain and the amount of gas fees it collects from transactions, meaning the Foundation mints more new coins to pay expenses.

The analyst did posit that a proactive ""change of commercial direction from the Ethereum Foundation – such as taxing Layer-2s"" could mitigate these issues and improve its market share, but said they think this is ""unlikely.""

BASE may have proved a very profitable project for Coinbase. The company doesn’t disclose the network’s revenue directly, but Coin Metrics estimates Base generated approximately 7,417 ETH (roughly $24 million) in profit during the final quarter of 2024.

Kendrick pointed out some other possible avenues whereby ETH could keep its market dominance; for example, if tokenized real-world assets, which commonly use Ethereum, were to suddenly surge in popularity. The analyst feels ETH’s security credentials will maintain its popularity in this area but stated, ""this is no longer a sound basis for our medium-term views.""

Ethereum Pectra Upgrade Looms

The gloomy predictions from some analysts come as the Ethereum community is preparing for Pectra, its biggest update since 2022’s ""The Merge."" Its introduction could bring significant improvements in ETH staking, dramatically raising current limits, as well as the ability to pay gas fees in cryptocurrencies other than ETH.

Despite several technical mishaps while testing the update, it could hit the mainnet as early as April 25. Developers plan to launch a final testnet, Hoodi, later this month.

ETH is up 1.3% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. However, it’s down 29.6% month-on-month and 46.7% year-to-date.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy has resumed its Bitcoin buying.

After a brief pause, the business intelligence firm has snapped up another $10.7 million worth of BTC, adding 130 coins to its already massive stash, bringing its total holdings to nearly half a million.

The purchase, made at an average price of $82,981 per Bitcoin, represents the smallest acquisition by the company since it first started buying Bitcoin in 2020.

https://x.com/saylor/status/1901606324447646170

With this latest buy, Strategy's total Bitcoin holdings have now reached 499,226 BTC, valued at around $41.4 billion, or approximately 2.4% of the total Bitcoin supply, per the latest U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) Commission filing.

The acquisition was funded using proceeds from the “STRK ATM,” a new program Strategy launched to raise up to $21 billion in fresh capital.

An At-The-Market (ATM) offering allows a company to sell shares directly into the secondary trading market at prevailing market prices over time, rather than through a traditional public offering.

The Bitcoin giant's long-term plan involves raising $42 billion over the next three years to expand its holdings significantly as part of its “strategy” to acquire Bitcoin as a key asset despite market fluctuations.

Following the announcement, Bitcoin’s price jumped slightly, but has since fallen by 0.3%, trading at $82, 921.51, CoinGecko data shows.

Amid the recent price fluctuations of the asset, Strategy’s Bitcoin yield stands at 6.9% year-to-date, though it still falls short of the firm’s target of 15% for 2025.

While the latest buy is among its smallest, the company had its largest acquisition of 2025 on Feb. 24, purchasing 20,365 BTC for nearly $2 billion. Starting in early November, it had purchased Bitcoin on a near-weekly basis.

Alongside its corporate acquisitions, Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, has always advocated for Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for the U.S. government.

Last month, Saylor suggested the U.S. could purchase up to 20% of Bitcoin’s total supply, potentially using the asset to eliminate the national debt—just before President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a strategic “crypto reserve.”

Even with the smaller size of the latest acquisition, Strategy continues as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, followed by MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT), Bitcoin Treasuries data shows.

Strategy stock (NASDAQ: MSTR) was most recently trading at about $293.60—a 13.41% increase at the close, per Yahoo Finance.

Four teenagers have been charged after an OnlyFans streamer was ordered to hand over her crypto at gunpoint.

Kaitlyn Siragusa, a popular influencer also known as Amouranth, was targeted at her home in Texas earlier this month. Three armed assailants had broken into her bedroom, hit her repeatedly with a pistol, and ordered her to transfer digital assets.

She escorted them to another part of her Houston property where her husband fired a gun, and the robbers fled the scene.

Demarcus Morris Jr., who is 17 years old, has been charged with aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Dylan Nesho Campbell, 18, and Bryan Anthony Salazar Guerrero, 19, face the same charges.

Harris County District Clerk's Office says an unidentified 16-year-old is also a suspect in the case. Two of the teenagers remain in custody, while a third has posted a bond of $100,000.

Back in November, Siragusa had posted a picture of her posing in lingerie on X, along with the caption: ""Help! Do I sell or hold my BTC?""

A screenshot of her Coinbase account showed she had 211 BTC in her wallet—worth about $17.6 million at current market rates.

In an interview with FOX 26 Houston, Siragusa revealed that she was on the phone to her husband, who was in a separate part of their property, throughout the ordeal.

""They shot down my door. These three guys came into my room, turned all the lights on and had the gun pointed at me,"" she said. ""They cornered me into a chair in my room and were interrogating me—asking me 'where's the crypto?' over and over.""

Dramatic footage shows Siragusa leading the gunmen to her husband, supposedly to hand over her hardware wallet.

The attackers left the scene empty-handed, with one shouting ""I got shot"" as they fled on foot.

Siragusa recently revealed that the men only managed to take her MacBook, which was later traced to the same hospital where she had been treated for her injuries.

https://decrypt.co,PancakeSwap CAKE Jumps 37% Amid Meme Coin Resurgence and Binance Tether Delisting,https://decrypt.co/310139/pancakeswap-meme-coin-resurgence-binance-tether-delisting,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:49:17 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

PancakeSwap, a decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, has the largest trading volume over the past 24 hours—beating even Ethereum-based competitor Uniswap.

And according to CoinGecko, all that volume has sent the price of its CAKE token surging as much as 40% in the past day. This comes after Binance delisted Tether from its centralized exchange, prompting an increase in Tether volume on PancakeSwap, and an unrelated surge of interest in meme coins on Binance Smart Chain.

CAKE is up 37% over the past 24 hours, and 57% up on the week, pushing it to $2.49 as the 99th largest cryptocurrency by market cap according to CoinGecko. Equally, PancakeSwap is leading the pack of decentralized exchanges with $647 million worth of trading volume over the past 24 hours—with nearly 61% of DEX market share over this period.

Much of this volume could be motivated by Binance, the centralized exchange that created the Binance Smart Chain, announcing that it would delist Tether’s USDT, and a few other stablecoins, at the end of the month. The company cited compliance issues in the EU for the delistings.

Now, PancakeSwap has processed more than $346 million worth of trading volume for USDT over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. That amounts to roughly 54% of trading volume on the exchange. This is likely because Binance users are taking their USDT off the exchange and onto Binance Smart Chain to avoid being affected by the delisting at the end of the month.

On top of this, it appears that Binance Smart Chain meme coins are seeing a resurgence.

Back in 2021, the network was one of the cultural hubs for meme coins due to its low gas fees. At one point, the SafeMoon meme coin skyrocketed to a market cap of $6 billion. However, the trenches have been more focused on Solana for speculative meme coin trading—largely due to the creation of launchpad Pump.fun.

According to DappBay, most Binance Smart Chain meme coins have found themselves in the green over the past 24 hours. In fact, the BSC meme coin market capitalization has jumped 48% over the past week to $2.71 billion. This has likely been helped along by the launch of SpringBoard, a token launchpad akin to Pump.fun, on Binance Smart Chain at the end of last year.

One of the best performing tokens is Mubarak (MUBARAK), a token referencing the Islamic term to celebrate the end of Ramadan, which has jumped 56% on the day—at one point nearly touching a market cap of $150 million. With this, Mubarak accounts for over 12% of daily trading volume on PancakeSwap.

As a result of all of this newfound interest, Binance Smart Chain processed the second most decentralized app volume of the top blockchains this week, according to DappRadar, with $9.26 billion. The network is now second only to Ethereum, which has seen $77.25 billion worth of volume in the past week.

The Trump administration’s pro-crypto agenda risks ""sowing the seeds"" of a financial crisis, according to a top European Central Bank official.

In an interview with French weekly La Tribune Dimanchei, François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France and member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council, argued that the U.S. ""risks sinning through negligence.""

Villeroy de Galhau argued that, ""by encouraging crypto assets and non-bank finance,"" the Trump administration ""is sowing the seeds of future upheavals,"" adding that financial crises ""often originate in the United States and spread to the rest of the world.”

His admonitions echo a previous warning from sixteen Nobel Economists who claimed in June last year that Trump's ""fiscally irresponsible budgets"" could ""reignite"" inflation and broader economic instability. Villeroy de Galhau argued that Trump pursues a “false vision"" in which the global economy functions as a ""zero-sum game,"" calling on Europe to ""strengthen"" its negotiating position.

Earlier this year, the ECB announced a two-phase digital payments infrastructure initiative, under which it plans to explore “a more integrated, long-term solution” for settlements of central bank money-denominated transactions on a blockchain. The initiative would lay the groundwork for a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Trump’s crypto agenda

In the lead-up to and after the U.S. elections, President Donald Trump has vowed, acted, and worked on his administration's promises to embrace and bolster the country's leadership in crypto and digital assets.

In its first couple of months, the Trump administration has established a crypto council, a Presidential Working Group on digital assets, worked to pass crucial crypto bills, signed an executive order to establish a Bitcoin Reserve, hosted the inaugural crypto summit at the White House, and promised to end Biden-era crypto banking rules, among other moves that have boosted the profile of the crypto industry.

Trump’s pro-crypto push has failed to shore up the crypto market, though, with both Bitcoin and U.S. equities rattled by market volatility sparked by his economic agenda. Following Trump's threat to impose 200% tariffs on European spirits on Thursday last week, the S&P 500 plummeted more than 10% from its February high, reporting from Reuters indicates.

Bitcoin, at the time, tumbled to $81,600—down 25% from a January peak of $109,000. On the same day, crypto markets saw liquidations of over $1 billion, with analysts pointing to risk aversion across global markets and escalating U.S. tariff disputes as key drivers.",decrypt

The Bank of Korea has ruled out the inclusion of Bitcoin in its foreign exchange reserves, citing concerns over the crypto's price volatility.

In response to a March 16 inquiry from Representative Cha Gyu-geun of the National Assembly’s Planning and Finance Committee, the central bank pointed out the risks of Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, which can make it an unreliable asset for reserves.

It marks the first time the central bank has clarified its position on the potential use of the crypto for national reserves, emphasizing its “cautious” approach while dealing with the asset.

The central bank’s statement comes amid ongoing international discussions about the role of crypto in national reserves following U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent executive order to establish a strategic “crypto reserve,” with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) at its heart.

Currently, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $83,450, marking a 23% decline from its peak of $109,000 in January, according to CoinGecko.

“If the virtual asset market becomes unstable, there is a concern that transaction costs will increase rapidly in the process of converting Bitcoin into cash,” a spokesperson for the central bank said, according to reports in local media.

The Bank of Korea also said the world’s largest crypto does not meet the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) criteria for foreign exchange reserves.

The IMF requires foreign exchange reserves to be liquid, marketable, and in convertible currencies with investment-grade credit ratings—requirements that Bitcoin does not fulfill, the bank said.

Bitcoin reserves in Asia

Just last week, a seminar hosted by the Democratic Party of Korea discussed the possibility of including Bitcoin in the country’s foreign exchange reserves, just a day before President Trump signed his executive order.

Meanwhile, South Korea’s closest neighbour, Japan, has also shown hesitancy regarding the inclusion of Bitcoin in foreign reserves.

Last December, Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba voiced concerns about insufficient information on the U.S. and other countries' plans for Bitcoin reserves.

Ishiba’s concerns followed a proposal by Satoshi Hamada, a member of Japan’s House of Councilors, suggesting Japan explore converting a portion of its foreign reserves into Bitcoin.",decrypt

Crypto exchange OKX has temporarily halted its decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator in response to security concerns and recent “attacks” targeting its platform.

The exchange announced the pause on Sunday, citing the need to address incomplete blockchain tagging and implement new security features to prevent misuse by malicious actors.

We are temporarily pausing our DEX aggregator to address incomplete tagging on blockchain explorers while we also roll out new security features. This is to address the recent coordinated attacks by media along with unsuccessful efforts by Lazarus group to misuse our DeFi… pic.twitter.com/r6oHNIaalT — OKX (@okx) March 17, 2025

Blockchain tagging refers to the process of labeling transactions on a blockchain to accurately identify and track them on explorers.

“We detected a coordinated effort by Lazarus group to misuse our defi services,” the company said. “At the same time, we've noticed an increase in competitive attacks aiming to undermine our work.”

The move comes amidst scrutiny of OKX’s role in the alleged laundering of $100 million from the Bybit hack. OKX did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.

In January, Bybit, one of the largest crypto exchanges, suffered a devastating hack in which nearly $1.5 billion in Ethereum (ETH) and ETH-related tokens were stolen, making it the largest hack in crypto history.

The hack was attributed to the Lazarus Group, a notorious North Korean hacking collective believed to be responsible for a string of high-profile cybercrimes.

Bybit CEO Ben Zhou recently pointed out that nearly $100 million, or 40,233 ETH, from the $1.5 billion hack had flowed through OKX’s Web3 platform, with a significant portion of the funds now lost and untraceable.

In a related development, Bloomberg reported on March 11 that regulators in the European Union are reportedly investigating OKX’s decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, questioning whether the exchange’s Web3 service is compliant with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation.

The report, citing people familiar with the matter, said the exchange’s Web3 service, which includes its wallet platform, may be used for illicit activities, prompting discussions among EU regulators about potential penalties.

OKX denied the allegations, refuting the claim that it is under investigation by European regulators and calling the report “misleading.”

“We urge our community to see these attacks for what they really are - deliberate attempts to mischaracterize our role and the value we bring to the ecosystem,” OKX said in the Sunday statement.

Haider Rafique, the company’s global CMO, called the accusations ""preposterous,"" saying OKX had implemented measures to prevent the misuse of its services.

“We did the exact opposite,” Rafique noted. “We froze funds moving to our CEX and launched new features to detect/block hackers' addresses from using our DEX or wallet services.”

In light of the situation, OKX confirmed it had consulted with regulators and made the decision to pause its DEX aggregator services proactively.

OKX's recent troubles are compounded by a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).

Last month, OKX’s affiliate, Aux Cayes FinTech Co. Ltd, agreed to pay over $500 million in penalties after pleading guilty to operating without a money transmitter license and failing to follow anti-money laundering laws.

The settlement stems from accusations that OKX facilitated illicit transactions, with the DOJ stating that OKX violated U.S. laws by actively seeking American customers.

Digital asset prime broker FalconX said Saturday it has completed the “first-ever” block trade for CME Group's Solana futures with StoneX as counterparty, a day ahead of the SOL futures launch of new contracts expected on March 17.

The San Mateo, California headquartered broker executed the transaction with the goal of providing a way ""to manage risk and price exposure on a regulated venue,"" Josh Barkhordar, head of U.S. sales at the firm said in a statement.

A block trade in this context is a large-volume, privately negotiated transaction of the futures contracts, done outside the open market to avoid disrupting the asset’s price.

CME Group debuted the Solana futures contract in late February to meet ""increasing client demand,"" as it vies to position the offering as a precursor and ""primary pre-requisite"" to a SOL ETF.

​Several asset management firms have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch Solana ETFs.

Notably, Franklin Templeton, managing over $1.5 trillion in assets, submitted a filing in late February 2025. Other firms, including Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital, have also filed for spot Solana ETFs.

Solana futures follow the pattern established with Bitcoin and Ethereum, where futures trading preceded ETF authorization and approval from a regulatory body.

The new contracts come in two sizes: standard contracts representing 500 SOL and micro contracts representing 25 SOL.

The futures are then cash-settled based on the CME CF Solana-Dollar Reference Rate, calculated daily at 4:00 p.m. London time, providing a standardized benchmark for SOL's U.S. dollar price.

FalconX operates as a key liquidity provider for CME Group's crypto derivatives suite. The company reports executing over $1.5 trillion in trading volume across over 400 tokens for approximately 600 institutions.

The firm has pursued strategic expansion in institutional crypto markets, acquiring derivatives platform Arbelos Markets in January 2025 and partnering with liquidity and data solutions provider TP ICAP's Fusion Digital Assets in February last year.

Meanwhile, CME Group claims that its crypto derivatives market has demonstrated substantial growth, with average daily volume reaching 202,000 contracts in early 2025, representing a 73% increase year-over-year.

The exchange reports average open interest of 243,600 contracts, up 55% year-over-year, with more than 11,300 unique accounts trading its crypto products.

On centralized crypto exchanges, Solana derivatives show a 66% volume increase to $7.24 billion, covering a bullish bias with multiple long/short ratios above 2, despite some $12.29 million in 24-hour liquidations, data from Coinglass shows.

Solana is down 6.4% to $127, and remains under pressure following its January all-time high near $293.31, CoinGecko data shows.

Bitcoin and Ethereum extended losses on Sunday as traders braced for another volatile week, with U.S. stock futures pointing lower ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy meeting.

Bitcoin slipped nearly 1.8% to trade around $82,700, while Ethereum dropped 2.5% to $1,889, as investors assessed the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting regulatory developments.

As of Sunday evening, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures declined 0.37%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite futures fell 0.46% and 0.55%, respectively.

Markets are increasingly focused on the Federal Reserve’s rate outlook, with futures traders pricing in a high probability that the central bank will hold interest rates steady this week.

While expectations for rate cuts later this year remain intact, recent inflation data and strong labor market numbers have raised concerns that the Fed may delay easing monetary policy on Wednesday.

A more hawkish stance could weigh on risk assets, including crypto, which have traded in lockstep with equities in recent months.

Geopolitical tensions are also adding pressure.

President Trump’s recent announcement of new tariffs and potential retaliatory measures from the European Union have injected fresh uncertainty into global markets.

In addition, his executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve briefly fueled speculation about U.S. government involvement in crypto markets before investors realized no immediate budget had been allocated for purchases.

Bitcoin's initial spike following the announcement was short-lived, with prices reversing once traders recognized the lack of immediate action from Washington.

Meanwhile, in the derivatives market, leverage remains high.

Coinglass data shows crypto futures open interest remains elevated, despite over $253 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours.

Funding rates, which briefly turned negative during last week’s sell-off, have returned to neutral, suggesting uncertainty in market positioning.

With macroeconomic risks mounting and regulatory developments unfolding, traders are looking for a catalyst to break the current downtrend.

The Federal Reserve’s policy decision, coupled with any new signals from institutional investors or regulatory bodies, could determine whether crypto markets regain momentum or face further downside pressure in the coming weeks.",decrypt

Following the $1.5 billion Bybit hack, OKX Web3 reportedly drew regulatory attention over concerns about its platform being used for money laundering.

In its March 17 statement, OKX revealed that the notorious North Korean hacking group had conducted a “coordinated effort” to misuse its DeFi services. This prompted the company to take “decisive action,” including the temporary suspension of its DEX aggregator services, after consulting with regulators.

Hacks Are Common

Based on the general tactics employed by Lazarus, this could involve using OKX’s platforms to launder stolen funds, since DeFi platforms often allow users to conduct transactions without strict Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.

According to OKX, the suspension is intended to allow for the implementation of “additional upgrades” to prevent further misuse.

The company is also working with blockchain explorers to correct what it describes as “incomplete labeling,” where its aggregator was mistakenly identified as the point of trade, rather than the underlying DEX.

OKX noted that OKX Web3 operates as a DEX aggregator, facilitating trades across multiple decentralized exchanges, and does not hold custody of user funds.

“Our role is to provide access to liquidity across multiple protocols, offering users the most efficient peer-to-peer trading experience possible,” the firm clarified.

OKX has also launched a “hacker address detection system” for its DEX aggregator and a system to track and block hacker addresses across its centralized exchange (CEX) platform in real-time.

The OKX team alleges that some parties have deliberately misrepresented their Web3 platform, which they believe undermines both the company and the digital asset sector.

The firm has pledged to continue innovating and advocating for a “more transparent and responsible digital asset space,” promising further updates in the near future.

EU Regulators Probe OKX Web3’s Role

Following the landmark Bybit attack, OKX, alongside other crypto firms and figures, publicly voiced support for the exchange. Nevertheless, OKX has been under scrutiny for allegations that its Web3 services were used to launder stolen funds from the Bybit hack.

Bloomberg reported last week that European Union regulators were investigating OKX’s Web3 service amid concerns that hackers, then identified as Lazarus Group, used the platform to launder $100 million in stolen crypto assets from Bybit.

The investigation surfaced in the wake of a $1.5 billion hack targeting crypto exchange Bybit. The massive funds stolen have made it one of the largest crypto thefts in crypto history.

The Bloomberg report stated that regulators were examining whether OKX’s Web3 service, which the company markets as a DeFi platform and self-custodial wallet, falls under the EU’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations. Lazarus Group allegedly used the service to transfer stolen funds across various exchanges and blockchains.

Responding to Bloomberg’s reporting of the investigation, Haider Rafique, OKX’s Chief Marketing Officer, said in an X statement that the claims were misleading. The company maintains that its Web3 service operates similarly to other self-custody wallets and exchange aggregators in the industry.

Rafique also noted that OKX froze funds associated with the Bybit hack that entered its CEX and developed new security measures to detect and block malicious addresses. And according to him, the exchange cooperated with law enforcement and Bybit’s legal team to provide technical support to track hackers’ wallet addresses in real-time.

Bybit CEO Ben Zhou, who has acted actively to address the exchange hack and provide transparent updates, said that there was a misunderstanding regarding the source of information in a recent Bloomberg article.

He clarified that Bybit did not provide any direct statements to the publication, and that the information might have originated from Lazarus Bounty’s webpage, which tracks the movement of stolen funds in real-time.",blockonomi

Bear pennant pattern on 4-hour chart suggests potential 35% drop to $0.464

Whale addresses offloaded approximately 2 million ADA in one week

Price rejected at $0.75-$0.76 resistance, currently trading near $0.7 support

Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem shows weakness with only $360 million TVL

Despite bearish signals, the $0.65-$0.68 range may offer buying opportunity

Cardano has experienced a roller coaster of price action in recent weeks. The cryptocurrency saw a massive pump in early March, rising over 100%, only to give back most gains to profit-takers.

The price has been consolidating sideways since then. This movement has created uncertainty among traders about the next market direction.

From a technical standpoint, Cardano has confirmed a bear pennant breakdown on the 4-hour chart. This pattern often signals continuation of a downward trend.

The price recently rejected resistance at $0.742. It failed to reclaim both the 50-period and 200-period EMAs, which reinforces the bearish outlook.

The bear pennant formed after ADA’s sharp drop from $1.15 to $0.713. This was followed by a consolidation phase that created a symmetrical triangle pattern.

However, the pattern has broken to the downside. This breakdown has sent ADA to $0.714, and technical projections suggest a move toward $0.464 by April.

$ADA Price If this triangle breaks to the upside, we could see a move towards $0.90 🚀 pic.twitter.com/I0fk1Msqsw — Trader Edge (@Pro_Trader_Edge) March 15, 2025

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 44.06. This reading remains in bearish territory and suggests further weakness ahead.

On-chain data from Messari tracks the supply of ADA held in whale addresses. These are wallets containing at least 1,000,000 ADA tokens.

Between March 2 and March 9, the whale-held supply dropped from 23.108 billion ADA to 23.106 billion ADA. This marks a net outflow of approximately 2 million ADA in just one week.

This decline suggests large holders are offloading their positions. Whales may be anticipating further price drops or moving capital to other investments.

Historically, whale distribution often signals upcoming sell-offs. This trend could indicate further downside for ADA unless new buying pressure emerges.

Cardano also faces fundamental challenges that align with this bearish outlook. Despite its research-driven approach and staking ecosystem, the network struggles to maintain momentum.

As of March 17, 2025, Cardano ranked outside the top 10 blockchains by total value locked (TVL). It has approximately $360 million in its DeFi ecosystem.

This figure is far lower than Ethereum’s $48.97 billion and Solana’s $7.06 billion TVL. The gap highlights Cardano’s challenges in attracting DeFi activity.

Despite the 2021 Alonzo hard fork introducing smart contract functionality, Cardano’s growth has been slower than expected. Daily transactions average 66,000 in early March, compared to Ethereum’s 1.1 million.

Broader economic factors have also affected sentiment. The Federal Reserve’s pause on rate cuts and ongoing trade tensions have hurt altcoins more than Bitcoin.

However, not all indicators point to continued losses. The Awesome Oscillator shows weak bearish momentum, and the Accumulation/Distribution line has only retraced gains from early March.

The Fear and Greed Index currently stands at 30, indicating fear in the market. This fearful sentiment has persisted throughout March.

For traders looking at risk-to-reward ratios, the $0.65-$0.68 region may offer a buying opportunity. This zone coincides with the range low and has shown support in recent price action.

The one-week liquidation heatmap shows the $0.68-$0.69 area as a liquidity pocket. This could pull prices lower before a potential bounce.

It’s worth noting that Cardano’s next move will be heavily dependent on Bitcoin trends. BTC saw a 2.38% decline in seven hours, which dragged ADA down by 4.68%.",blockonomi

Bank of Korea has ruled out adding Bitcoin to its foreign exchange reserves

Officials cited Bitcoin’s high volatility and high transaction costs during market instability

Bitcoin does not meet IMF criteria for foreign exchange reserves (liquidity, market stability, investment-grade credit rating)

Discussions about national crypto reserves have increased globally after the US established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve

South Korea is gradually loosening some crypto regulations, considering allowing crypto ETFs

The Bank of Korea has officially ruled out adding Bitcoin to its foreign exchange reserves, citing concerns about the cryptocurrency’s volatility and liquidity.

The decision comes amid growing global discussions about the role of digital assets in national financial strategies.

On March 16, South Korea’s central bank responded to a written inquiry from Representative Cha Gyu-geun of the National Assembly’s Planning and Finance Committee.

Officials stated they have “neither discussed nor reviewed” the possibility of incorporating Bitcoin into the country’s reserves.

The bank pointed to Bitcoin’s price instability as a key factor in its decision. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin prices have fluctuated between $98,000 and $76,000 before settling around $83,000, representing a 15% decline since February 16.

Central bankers warned that “transaction costs to cash out Bitcoins could rise drastically” if the cryptocurrency market experiences instability. This concern about liquidity during market downturns appears to be a major factor in their cautious stance.

Officials also noted that Bitcoin fails to meet the International Monetary Fund’s requirements for foreign exchange reserves. These criteria mandate that reserve assets maintain liquidity, market stability, and hold a credit rating of investment grade or higher.

The Bank of Korea emphasized that foreign exchange reserves must be immediately usable when needed. Bitcoin’s volatility and uncertain liquidity during market stress make it unsuitable for this purpose in their assessment.

Professor Yang Jun-seok of the Catholic University of Korea supported this view. He stated,

“It is appropriate for foreign exchange to be held in proportion to the currencies of countries with which we trade.”

The central bank’s position aligns with other major monetary authorities worldwide. They mentioned that institutions like the European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, and Japanese financial authorities share a similarly skeptical stance on Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

The rejection comes despite increasing calls from some quarters to consider Bitcoin’s potential role in national financial systems. At a March 6 policy seminar, some members of the Korean Democratic Party urged the central bank to explore adding Bitcoin to the country’s reserves.

Global Interest in Crypto Reserves

Global interest in national crypto reserves has grown following the US government’s decision to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This initiative, created through an executive order by President Donald Trump earlier this month, aims to build a digital asset stockpile.

Some countries have shown openness to the concept. Brazil and the Czech Republic have expressed interest in exploring Bitcoin as a potential reserve asset.

Professor Kang Tae-soo from the KAIST Graduate School of Finance commented on these developments. He noted that the US is “likely to leverage stablecoins rather than BTC to maintain dollar hegemony” and questioned “whether the IMF will recognize stablecoins as foreign exchange reserves in the future.”

While rejecting Bitcoin for its reserves, South Korea has been gradually relaxing some of its crypto regulations. The country’s Financial Services Commission has been working to lift restrictions on institutional crypto trading.

Regulators are also preparing a second legal framework focused on stablecoin oversight. This suggests a more nuanced approach to digital assets beyond the reserve question.

Korean policymakers are considering allowing crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to the chairman of the Korea Exchange, this move could bring fresh opportunities to the country’s financial sector.

The Financial Services Commission has taken a similar position on Bitcoin reserves as the central bank. In November, FSC Chairman Kim Byung-hwan acknowledged calls for a national Bitcoin reserve but dismissed the idea as premature.",blockonomi

A federal judge has ordered crypto platform Debiex to pay approximately $2.5 million in restitution and penalties after the company failed to respond to a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

The CFTC accused Debiex of operating a “pig butchering” scam that targeted investors through romantic deception. The term refers to fraudsters who build relationships with victims before convincing them to invest in fake schemes.

On March 13, Arizona federal court Judge Douglas Rayes granted the CFTC’s motion for summary judgment against Debiex. The judge ruled that the platform must return about $2.26 million stolen from customers.

The court also imposed a civil penalty of nearly $221,500. Judge Rayes stated that Debiex’s failure to respond to the lawsuit was not due to “excusable neglect,” finding no justification for the company’s inaction.

The CFTC initially filed the lawsuit against Debiex in January 2024. According to court documents, the platform marketed itself as a “Blockchain Network Decentralized perpetual contract trading platform” where users could engage in futures trading and mining transactions.

In reality, the operation was allegedly a sophisticated romance scam targeting unsuspecting investors. The CFTC claimed that Debiex staff posed as female traders to build trust with potential victims.

These fake personas engaged in continuous conversations with targets and sent personal photos. They presented themselves as highly successful cryptocurrency investors to gain credibility.

The scheme successfully lured five victims who collectively deposited around $2.3 million into the fraudulent platform. Rather than facilitating legitimate trades, Debiex simply stole the funds, according to the CFTC.

The court documents detailed how victims were provided with fabricated account balances after depositing funds. The platform displayed fake trading positions and false profit figures to maintain the illusion of legitimacy.

“All of this information was most likely false,” the CFTC stated in its complaint. The agency found that customer deposits were funneled through multiple digital wallets to hide their final destination.

The CFTC also identified a key figure in the operation named Zhāng Chéng Yáng. He was accused of acting as a “money mule” by handling transactions through cryptocurrency wallets used to receive and launder victims’ funds.

Default Judgement Against Zhāng

On March 12, Judge Rayes granted the CFTC’s request for a default judgment against Zhāng. The court concluded that he controlled an OKX wallet that received assets to which he had no legal claim.

OKX had been voluntarily preserving the wallet’s contents during the investigation. The wallet contained nearly 63 Ether (ETH) valued at approximately $119,500 and $5.70 worth of Tether (USDT).

Judge Rayes ordered these funds to be transferred to one of the victims. This represents a small portion of the total amount stolen through the scheme.

The CFTC’s case highlights the growing concern about romance scams in the cryptocurrency space. These scams typically begin on social media platforms where fraudsters initiate romantic relationships with targets.

After building trust over time, scammers convince victims to invest in what appear to be legitimate cryptocurrency trading platforms. These platforms are actually fraudulent operations designed to steal funds.

The Debiex case comes amid broader concerns about increasing losses in the crypto ecosystem. According to a report by blockchain security platform Immunefi, losses in the crypto ecosystem increased dramatically in February 2025.

The report showed that registered losses jumped from $73,915,700 in January 2025 to $1,528,342,400 in February 2025. This represents a 20-fold increase month-over-month.

The February 2025 figure also marks an 18-fold increase compared to the same period a year prior. In February 2024, registered losses were $81,603,400.

The CFTC continues to actively pursue cases involving cryptocurrency fraud. The agency has emphasized the importance of investor awareness regarding romance scams and other deceptive practices in the digital asset space.",blockonomi

James Howells lost a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin (worth around £769m) in a Welsh landfill in 2013

His appeal against Newport City Council was rejected by the UK Court of Appeal

Judge Christopher Nugee ruled there was “no real prospect of success” for his case

Howells plans to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR)

The Docksway landfill where the hard drive is believed to be located is set to close in 2025-2026

James Howells, the UK man who lost a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin in a Welsh landfill, has had his appeal rejected by the UK Court of Appeal. This latest setback comes after years of trying to gain permission to search the landfill site where he believes his valuable hard drive remains buried.

The hard drive was accidentally thrown away by Howells’ ex-partner in 2013. At current prices, the 8,000 Bitcoin stored on it are worth approximately £769 million ($660 million).

Lord Justice Christopher Nugee denied Howells’ appeal in court documents released on March 14. The judge stated there was “no real prospect of success” and “no other compelling reason why the appeal should be heard.”

Appeal request to the Royal Court of Appeal: refused The Great British Injustice System strikes again… The state always protects the state. Next stop: ECHR pic.twitter.com/KFYRSbsEPo — James Howells (@howelzy) March 14, 2025

This ruling marks the second unsuccessful attempt by Howells to use UK courts to force Newport City Council to allow him to search the Docksway landfill. His previous case was rejected by the High Court in January.

Judge Andrew Keyser had previously dismissed the case, saying there was “no realistic prospect” of Howells succeeding at a full trial. The Newport City Council has repeatedly denied Howells permission to search the landfill site.

Nugee also refused permission for Howells to appeal to the Supreme Court. This effectively ends Howells’ options within the UK legal system.

Howells has now announced plans to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). He claims that both the UK High Court and Court of Appeal breached his rights during recent proceedings.

“The only legal option left to me is to apply to the ECHR with a claim that my A1P1 – right to property – and AA6 – Right to Fair Trial – have been breached,” Howells stated after the ruling.

He expressed frustration with the UK legal system, writing on social media: “The Great British Injustice System strikes again… The state always protects the state.”

The ECHR cannot overrule UK court decisions directly. However, a ruling in Howells’ favor would call on UK courts to reconsider whether legislation was interpreted compatibly with ECHR provisions.

Howells plans to file his claim to the ECHR in the coming weeks. He remains determined despite the repeated setbacks, stating: “The British establishment wants to sweep this under the carpet and I will not let them. It will not go away – no matter how long it takes.”

Time may be running out for Howells’ search efforts. According to BBC News, the Docksway landfill is scheduled to close during the UK’s 2025-2026 financial year.

In February, reports emerged that Howells had assembled a group of investors willing to buy the landfill from Newport City Council. This represents another potential avenue for Howells to gain access to the site.

The case highlights the risks of self-custodied cryptocurrency storage. Few predicted Bitcoin would reach such high values when Howells lost his hard drive in 2013.

Newport City Council has maintained that searching the landfill would impact what they consider a critical piece of local infrastructure. This stance has remained unchanged despite Howells’ continued legal efforts.

Howells, an IT worker and early Bitcoin adopter, told City AM that his legal bid was about “proving a point.” He continues to believe his hard drive can be recovered from the landfill site.",blockonomi

Coinbase users targeted by mass phishing emails claiming mandatory wallet transfers by April 1

Scammers provide pre-generated recovery phrases that give them control of any transferred funds

Emails falsely cite a dismissed SEC lawsuit as reason for required wallet changes

Both Coinbase and Gemini exchanges have been impersonated in similar scams

Coinbase has warned users they will never send recovery phrases to customers

Cryptocurrency users are facing a new wave of phishing attacks impersonating major exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini. The fraudulent emails pressure victims to transfer their digital assets into self-custodial wallets using recovery phrases provided by the scammers.

The phishing campaign began over the weekend with mass emails sent to Coinbase users. These messages falsely claim that due to a court mandate stemming from a class-action lawsuit, users must move their assets to self-managed wallets before April 1.

Is anyone else getting the fake @coinbase emails and texts? They’re getting increasingly sophisticated. One is a fake verification text to get you to call a fake support number and the other is an email getting you to set up a real wallet they can drain. Stay safe out there. pic.twitter.com/8SgjPQeUqk — Steve 🤙 (@SteveKBark) March 14, 2025

“Coinbase will operate as a registered broker, allowing the purchases, but all assets must move to Coinbase Wallet,” the deceptive emails state. This creates a false sense of urgency to trick recipients into taking immediate action.

The scam is cleverly designed to appear legitimate. Fraudsters instruct victims to download the actual Coinbase Wallet app, making the scheme seem more credible. However, they then provide pre-generated recovery phrases.

These recovery phrases are the critical element of the scam. When users set up a new wallet using these phrases, they unknowingly give scammers complete access to any funds transferred to that wallet.

Reminder: Beware of recovery phrase scams. We're aware of new phishing emails going around pretending to be Coinbase and Coinbase Wallet. We will never send you a recovery phrase, and you should never enter a recovery phrase given to you by someone else. pic.twitter.com/E9Us5jNS4C — Coinbase Support (@CoinbaseSupport) March 14, 2025

The emails reference a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Coinbase for allegedly selling unregistered securities. This claim is false. The SEC dismissed its lawsuit against Coinbase on February 27, 2025.

Similar phishing attempts have targeted Gemini exchange users. These emails use the same tactics, claiming users need to set up new wallets because of a recent court decision. The SEC also ended its legal action against Gemini on February 26.

Coinbase has publicly responded to the scam. In a post on X on March 14, the company warned:

“We will never send you a recovery phrase, and you should never enter a recovery phrase given to you by someone else.”

This latest attack comes during a period of increased phishing activity in the cryptocurrency space. According to blockchain security firm CertiK, phishing attacks cost crypto users $1 billion across 296 incidents in 2024, making them the most serious security threat.

Users who fall victim to these scams typically lose all their transferred funds immediately. The fraudsters gain instant access to any cryptocurrency sent to the compromised wallets and can drain them within seconds.

The phishing emails create a false sense of legitimacy by appearing to come from trusted exchanges. They often include official logos, similar formatting, and language that mimics real communications from these companies.

Security experts advise crypto users to always verify communications directly through official exchange websites or apps. Users should never use recovery phrases provided by anyone else, even if the source appears to be legitimate.

Fake Zoom Calls

This phishing campaign follows reports of other sophisticated scams targeting the crypto industry. At least three crypto founders recently reported foiling attempts from alleged North Korean hackers who used fake Zoom calls to try to steal sensitive data.

The California financial regulator has also issued warnings about seven new types of crypto and AI scams currently targeting consumers. These evolving threats show how scammers continue to develop new methods to target cryptocurrency holders.

Crypto exchanges recommend enabling two-factor authentication and using hardware wallets for added security. They also emphasize that legitimate companies will never ask users to share recovery phrases or private keys via email, chat, or phone.

Victims shared examples of the scam emails on social media platform X, helping to spread awareness about the threat. Community vigilance has played an important role in alerting others to the ongoing phishing campaign.

The SEC’s dismissal of cases against both Coinbase and Gemini in February makes the scammers’ claims particularly misleading. No court has mandated that users of these exchanges must move to self-custodial wallets.",blockonomi

XRP has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern since 2018, with some analysts predicting a potential surge to $15

XRP wallets reached an all-time high of 6.87 million, suggesting growing user interest

Ripple’s recent transfer of 200 million XRP ($457 million) has fueled speculation about strategic moves

SEC may be considering classifying XRP as a commodity, similar to Ethereum, potentially enhancing ETF approval chances

Recent 8% price drop came after SEC paused approval process for altcoin ETFs, but derivatives market metrics indicate bullish sentiment may still be in play

XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, has been experiencing price fluctuations that have captured the attention of investors and analysts in the crypto space. The token recently ended a four-day winning streak with an 8% drop, trading at approximately $2.30 as of March 16, 2025.

The price movements come amid ongoing legal battles between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite the regulatory challenges, the crypto community remains watchful of XRP’s potential.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a technical pattern that could signal a major price movement for XRP. According to Martinez, XRP has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern since 2018 and has broken out of that pattern. This breakout might set the stage for a price surge in the near future.

Growing Wallet Numbers

Another positive indicator for XRP is the growing number of wallets. The number of XRP wallets has reached an all-time high of 6.87 million. This increase suggests more people are engaging with the token, which could indicate rising interest and potential upward momentum.

Ripple’s recent transfer of 200 million XRP, worth approximately $457 million, has added to the speculation about XRP’s future price movements. This large transfer, flagged by Whale Alert, has raised questions about Ripple’s strategic preparations.

SEC Lawsuit

The ongoing SEC lawsuit continues to be a key factor in XRP’s price trajectory. Recent reports suggest the SEC might be considering classifying XRP as a commodity as part of settlement negotiations. The SEC is reportedly using Ethereum’s current regulatory treatment as a benchmark in its deliberations.

If XRP receives classification as a commodity rather than a security, it could remove regulatory barriers and potentially open the door for ETF approval. This reclassification could attract institutional investors and drive demand higher.

However, the SEC recently announced a pause in the approval process for altcoin ETFs. This announcement appears to have contributed to the recent 8% price drop, affecting XRP and other cryptocurrencies with ETF filings in progress.

Despite the price dip, derivatives market metrics indicate bullish sentiment may still be present. According to Coinglass data, XRP’s trading volume has increased by 12.11%, reaching $6.05 billion. This suggests continued market activity despite the price pullback.

The 24-hour liquidation data shows $11.58 million, with $8.98 million in long positions and $2.60 million in short positions. This imbalance suggests short sellers might face a squeeze if prices stabilize, potentially leading to a rebound.

XRP’s open interest has dropped by 6.70% to $3.14 billion, indicating that leveraged positions are unwinding. Some analysts view this as a potential sign that the current correction might be nearing its end.

Technical indicators show the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 47.49, placing it in neutral territory. However, its recent bounce from 40 suggests growing bullish momentum. A sustained RSI climb above 50 would support the case for continued upward movement.

Ripple has reportedly filed for a trademark under the name “RIPPLE CUSTODY,” hinting at a potential new product focused on crypto storage solutions. This development could generate fresh investor interest in the coming week.

Fed Meeting

The upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on February 19 will likely influence broader market sentiment. Any indication of dovish monetary policy could increase risk appetite, potentially benefiting XRP and other digital assets.

If XRP maintains support near $2.30, bulls could regain control, potentially driving prices toward $2.50 in the short term and $2.80 beyond that. However, failure to hold this support level could lead to deeper drops, possibly testing the $1.92 level.

Key resistance levels to watch include $2.57 and $2.92. Breaking above these levels could open the path to higher targets, while falling below support at $2.30 might trigger further selling pressure.",blockonomi

French central bank governor Villeroy de Galhau warns Trump’s crypto support could trigger financial crisis

He states the US is “sowing the seeds of future upheavals” by encouraging crypto-assets

US has shifted to pro-crypto policies, creating a strategic reserve of Bitcoin and Ethereum

SEC has dropped major cases against crypto exchanges under Trump administration

Villeroy de Galhau calls current US deregulation “dangerous” and has been critical of Trump’s economic policies

The governor of France’s central bank has issued a stark warning about the United States’ approach to cryptocurrency regulation under President Donald Trump. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, who leads the Banque de France and serves as a member of the European Central Bank Governing Council, believes that Trump’s pro-crypto stance could lead to serious economic problems.

In an interview with French weekly La Tribune Dimanche, Villeroy de Galhau expressed concern that the US might be setting itself up for another financial crisis. “The United States risks sinning through negligence,” he stated in the interview published on March 16.

He pointed out that financial crises often start in America before spreading worldwide.

“By encouraging crypto-assets and non-bank finance, the American administration is sowing the seeds of future upheavals,” Villeroy de Galhau warned.

The French banker reminded readers that three of the five biggest financial crises in history began in the United States. These include The Great Depression following the 1929 Wall Street crash, the OPEC Oil Price Shock of 1973, and the Great Recession triggered by the collapse of the US housing market.

This is not the first time Villeroy de Galhau has spoken out against Trump’s economic approaches. Even before Trump’s January inauguration, he voiced concerns about American financial policy.

On January 15, he said,

“I believe that what we sometimes hear in the United States about the lack of regulation of non-banks, the various funds or the lack of regulation of crypto-assets is something that would put financial stability at risk.”

The French central banker has been openly critical of Trump’s broader economic policies as well. Earlier this week, he described Trump’s trade wars and economic approach as “a tragedy for the American economy.”

Villeroy de Galhau is not alone in his criticism. German central bank chief Joachim Nagel has also spoken out, calling Trump’s economic policy “economic policy from a horror show.”

Shift in Crypto Policy

Since Trump took office, there has been a clear shift in how the US handles digital assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has dropped major cases against crypto exchanges, including Coinbase.

Trump has also created what his administration calls a “crypto strategic reserve.” This plan involves the United States stockpiling popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

These moves represent a dramatic change from previous US approaches to digital currency regulation. Under the Biden administration, regulatory agencies had taken a much stricter stance toward the crypto industry.

The French central banker believes the current trend toward deregulation in America is highly risky. “The current wave of American deregulation is dangerous,” he stated in the interview.

Villeroy de Galhau’s comments come at a time of growing tension between European financial authorities and the Trump administration over various economic policies. European officials have increasingly expressed worry about the global impacts of US financial decisions.

The stark differences in regulatory approaches to cryptocurrency between Europe and the US may create challenges for companies operating across both markets. European authorities have generally maintained stricter oversight of digital assets.

Trump’s pro-crypto stance was a feature of his campaign, where he promised to make America “the crypto capital of the planet.” His administration has moved quickly to implement policies aligned with this goal.

Financial experts remain divided on whether the US approach will lead to innovation or instability. Villeroy de Galhau clearly believes the risks outweigh the potential rewards.",blockonomi

Toncoin (TON) saw a 67% increase in open interest and 17-20% price surge following news of Telegram founder Pavel Durov’s temporary departure from France

Durov was allowed to travel to Dubai after months of legal restrictions in France where he faces charges related to Telegram’s alleged role in enabling organized crime

TON is The Open Network’s native cryptocurrency and the exclusive blockchain infrastructure for Telegram’s Mini App ecosystem

Despite the recent price surge, 96% of TON holders were reportedly at a loss at press time

The case highlights ongoing tensions between regulators and privacy-focused platforms like Telegram

Toncoin (TON) prices jumped nearly 20% following reports that Telegram founder Pavel Durov received permission to temporarily leave France.

The cryptocurrency, which serves as the native token for The Open Network and Telegram’s blockchain infrastructure, saw its value rise to $3.45 on March 15 after months of downward pressure.

Durov had been under strict travel restrictions since his arrest in August 2024. He was detained at Le Bourget Airport near Paris on charges related to allegations that Telegram enabled organized crime activities. After questioning, he was released on a €5 million ($5.6 million) bail.

The court has now allowed Durov to travel to Dubai. Sources told AFP (Agence France-Presse) that he left France on March 16. The modified supervision conditions permit him to stay outside France for “several weeks.”

Durov holds multiple passports. These include Russian, French, and UAE citizenship. Telegram has not issued any official statement regarding his travel or the ongoing legal case.

Market Reaction

Open interest in Toncoin showed a strong market reaction. Data from CoinGlass shows TON’s open interest jumped 67% over 24 hours to reach $169 million. This represents the highest level since February 1.

Open interest tracks the total number of unsettled derivative contracts. These include options and futures tied to the cryptocurrency. The spike indicates growing trader activity and interest in TON.

On-chain data supports this trend. Dune Analytics reported a sharp rise in daily TON transactions. A major spike occurred on March 13, just before the announcement of Durov’s travel permission.

According to Trader Edge on X, Ton could be looking at a push towards $4.60 next.

The TON Foundation expressed support for Durov. In a statement, they said, “With nearly a billion users worldwide, Telegram represents a global movement committed to the freedom of communication and the inalienable right to privacy.”

Similar support came from the AKA token community. This project operates within the TON ecosystem and called Durov’s travel approval a “victory for freedom.”

Durov Arrest

This isn’t the first time TON prices reacted to Durov’s legal situation. When Durov was arrested in August 2024, TON’s open interest spiked 32% over 24 hours. However, the price fell nearly 12% at that time.

Some market analysts see positive signs for TON. Crypto Billion posted on X (formerly Twitter) that Toncoin is “showing signs of a potential long-term accumulation phase as it stabilizes near key support levels.”

However, the rally comes with risks. If TON’s price falls back toward the $3 level it traded at before the news, around $18.8 million in long positions could face liquidation.

TON’s price history shows volatility tied to Durov’s legal troubles. The price dropped over 35% after his August arrest, falling from $6.88 to $4.44 by September.

Despite the recent price increase, most TON investors face challenges. Reports indicate that 96% of TON holders were at a loss as of press time. The token has struggled to maintain momentum despite occasional price surges.

Durov’s legal case highlights broader regulatory tensions. Governments have pressured Telegram and similar services to enhance content moderation. The platform’s privacy-focused approach has put it at odds with authorities in multiple countries.

In January, Telegram announced it would exclusively support The Open Network for its messenger services. This decision strengthened the connection between the messaging platform and TON’s blockchain infrastructure.",blockonomi

Bitcoin ETFs recorded five consecutive weeks of outflows totaling $5.4 billion, nearly erasing 2025’s net inflows

BlackRock’s IBIT led withdrawals with $338.1 million in outflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $307.4 million

Bitcoin’s price decline of 11.95% in the last month correlates with reduced investor confidence

Ethereum ETFs are facing similar challenges with $189.9 million in outflows last week

Asset managers are exploring altcoin ETFs for Litecoin, Ripple, Solana, and Dogecoin as alternatives

Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing a rough start to 2025, with investors pulling out money for the fifth straight week. The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market has seen $921.4 million in net outflows in the past week alone. This brings the total withdrawals to about $5.4 billion over the five-week period.

BlackRock’s IBIT fund was hit hardest last week. Investors withdrew $338.1 million from this fund. Fidelity’s FBTC was close behind with $307.4 million in outflows.

Other Bitcoin ETFs also saw money leaving. Ark’s ARKB, Invesco’s BTCO, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Grayscale’s GBTC each had outflows between $33 million and $81 million.

Some funds saw smaller outflows. Bitwise’s BITB, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and VanEck’s HODL each had net outflows under $4 million. Only one fund bucked the trend: Grayscale’s BTC managed to attract $5.5 million in new investments.

The continuous outflows have almost wiped out the year’s gains. Data from SoSoValue shows that cumulative net inflows now stand at $35.20 billion. This is barely above the $35.00 billion recorded on the first trading day of 2025.

February was a tough month for Bitcoin ETFs. Only five days in February saw positive inflows. March has been even worse, with only one day of positive inflows so far.

The total value of these funds has dropped by nearly 25% from their peak in late January. Assets under management (AUM) for Bitcoin ETFs have seen a small recovery recently. This is mainly due to a 10% increase in Bitcoin’s price.

However, this price boost hasn’t been enough to stop the ongoing outflows. On March 11th, Bitcoin ETFs saw net withdrawals of $371 million. This marked the seventh day in a row of money flowing out.

The recent withdrawals from Bitcoin ETFs may be linked to Bitcoin’s price movements. Over the last month, Bitcoin has fallen by 11.95%, reaching lows of $77,000. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $84,009.

Due to falling prices and outflows, the total net assets of Bitcoin Spot ETFs have decreased by 21.70%. They now stand at $89.89 billion according to SoSoValue data.

Ethereum ETF Flows

Ethereum ETFs are facing similar issues. They recorded $189.9 million in net outflows last week. This marks their third straight week of withdrawals.

In total, Ethereum ETFs have seen $645.08 million in outflows over this three-week period. Like with Bitcoin, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA) saw the largest withdrawals at $63.3 million.

Currently, the total money invested in Ethereum ETFs stands at $2.52 billion. The total net assets are $6.72 billion, which is about 2.90% of Ethereum’s market cap. Ethereum is trading at $1,924, up 0.73% in the past day.

Other Assets

As Bitcoin ETFs struggle, attention is turning to altcoin ETFs. Asset managers are looking to create ETFs for other major cryptocurrencies. These include Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE).

These altcoins have grown more popular with investors. ETFs focused on them could provide alternatives to Bitcoin funds. Proposed funds might also include assets like Polkadot (DOT), Axelar (AXL), and Avalanche (AVAX).

This push for altcoin ETFs shows growing interest in expanding beyond Bitcoin. Analysts believe Litecoin, Ripple, Solana, and Dogecoin are most likely to get approval first. These coins have established market presence and larger investor communities.",blockonomi

A crypto whale has placed a $445M short position on Bitcoin with 40x leverage on Hyperliquid, while simultaneously betting bullish on the MELANIA token.

The whale’s liquidation price is around $86,000, and they added $5M in collateral to avoid liquidation when Bitcoin price rose.

A group of traders coordinated an effort to liquidate the whale’s position by driving up Bitcoin’s price, but the attempt was unsuccessful.

There is speculation that the whale may have insider information related to US President Donald Trump.

The whale continues to manage their position through Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) transactions, having closed positions worth $18M while maintaining a 5,167 BTC short position.

A cryptocurrency whale has placed a massive $445 million short position on Bitcoin using 40x leverage on the Hyperliquid platform. This large bearish bet comes despite Bitcoin recently bouncing back to its 200-day average above $84,000 over the weekend.

Data from Hyperliquid and blockchain analysis firm Lookonchain shows the whale’s Bitcoin short position has a liquidation price of around $86,000. This means if Bitcoin’s price rises above this level, the position could be forcibly closed with major losses.

This whale still managed to turn a profit despite being hunted by a team! 11 hours ago, @Cbb0fe publicly formed a team to hunt this whale who shorted $BTC with 40x leverage.

At the same time, the same trader has taken a bullish stance on the MELANIA token. The trader holds a 5x leveraged long position in MELANIA perpetual futures, betting the price will rise.

The MELANIA token is reportedly marketed by MKT World LLC. This is a Florida-registered company owned by Melania Trump, wife of current US President Donald Trump.

The whale’s contrarian trading strategy has caught widespread attention on social media. On Sunday, a pseudonymous trader with the username CBB publicly invited other market participants to form a group aimed at liquidating the whale’s position.

According to Lookonchain, “11 hours ago, @Cbb0fe publicly formed a team to hunt this whale who shorted $BTC with 40x leverage. Just one hour later, the team was in action, driving $BTC above $84,690 in a short period.”

This coordinated effort forced the whale to deposit an additional $5 million in USDC to increase their margin. This move helped them avoid liquidation of their position.

Despite the group’s efforts, the attempt to liquidate the whale’s position ultimately failed. The whale has continued to manage their position through Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) transactions.

On March 17 at 6:30 AM UTC, the whale closed two positions for a combined 208 BTC at a price of $83,392. The total value of these transactions was over $18 million.

On-chain data indicates the trader has accumulated a loss of nearly $1.1 million from unrealized profit and loss. Currently, the trader’s position stands at 5,167 BTC, valued at around $429 million.

The whale’s trading activities have sparked speculation about possible insider information. Some market commentators have suggested the trader may have connections to President Donald Trump, though no evidence has been presented to support these claims.

CBB’s call for a coordinated effort to liquidate the whale’s position gathered swift support. In a separate post, CBB told traders to message them with “7 figs size only” as the combined funds of the team had already exceeded eight figures.

Hyperliquid, the platform hosting these large positions, highlighted the transparency of their system. In a statement on social media platform X, Hyperliquid said,

“When a whale shorts $450M+ BTC and wants a public audience, it’s only possible on Hyperliquid.”

The platform added,

“Anyone can photoshop a PNL screenshot. No one can question a Hyperliquid position, just like no one can question a Bitcoin balance. The decentralized future is here.”

This is not the first time Hyperliquid has seen massive leveraged positions. Earlier in March, another whale began a long position with 50x leverage for 175,000 ETH worth $340 million.

That position led to challenges for the platform. Hyperliquid was forced to absorb the position at $1,915 in an effort to liquidate it, resulting in losses of more than $4 million for the platform.

Bitcoin is currently trading around $83,000, down approximately 1% over the past 24 hours. Despite this slight decline, Bitcoin has recorded gains of more than 1% over the past seven days.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,"Cardano (ADA) Sits at $0.73 as Market Awaits Big Moves, But Speculation Heats Up on BinoFi (BINO)’s 9900% Boom",https://blockonomi.com/cardano-ada-sits-at-0-73-as-market-awaits-big-moves-but-speculation-heats-up-on-binofi-binos-9900-boom/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 17:00:54 GMT","Cardano (ADA), one of the leading blockchain platforms focused on scalability and sustainability, is trading at $0.73. Over the past week, Cardano has shown limited volatility, consolidating between $0.73 and $0.76, leaving the market in anticipation of a decisive breakout.

This consolidation comes as analysts highlight a key technical resistance level at $0.76, which, if breached, could trigger a bullish rally potentially taking ADA towards $1.15. However, the cryptocurrency is also grappling with tight trading ranges, which some experts suggest may lead to extended periods of sideways movement if the resistance remains unbroken.

However, with other assets showing more dynamic growth potential, Cardano’s near-term excitement may seem tempered by market conditions.

BinoFi Steals the Spotlight with Bold Potential

While Cardano prepares for its potential breakout, investor focus has shifted to an emerging powerhouse in the crypto sphere—BinoFi (BINO).

Described as a innovative hybrid cryptocurrency exchange, BinoFi is making headlines for its ambitious aim to unite the best features of Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) and Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) into a seamless, user-centric experience.

What Makes BinoFi Stand Out?

BinoFi’s innovative approach addresses long-standing inefficiencies in the cryptocurrency trading ecosystem. By merging speed, security, and flexibility, BinoFi offers a platform tailored for both casual and professional users. Key highlights include:

Hybrid CEX/DEX Infrastructure: Traders can enjoy the convenience and liquidity of centralized exchanges while benefiting from the security and decentralization offered by DEX platforms.

Cross-Chain Trading Without Bridges: Unlike traditional systems requiring third-party bridges for transferring assets across blockchains, BinoFi enables direct cross-chain trading, seamlessly integrating networks like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana.

AI-Driven Tools: Sophisticated AI-powered trading bots and market analytics tools help users make informed decisions and automate trading strategies for optimized outcomes.

Non-Custodial MPC Wallets: The use of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology allows users to securely manage assets without compromising on control, offering added layers of security and gasless transactions.

A 9900% Boom on the Horizon?

What truly sets BinoFi apart is the rampant speculation around its growth potential. Industry experts are projecting a staggering 9900% increase in the value of its native token, $BINO, over the next few years.

This projection is based on strong adoption metrics, growing institutional interest, and the platform’s ability to solve major pain points in crypto trading.

BinoFi’s upcoming beta launch has only heightened the excitement, with early users waiting to see the platform’s intuitive design and smooth integration of features. The project has also garnered the attention of major investors, placing it among the most promising tokens of 2025.

An independent blockchain analyst says “Its hybrid exchange model is a game-changer, not just in functionality, but in delivering a scalable and secure trading ecosystem. The 9900% projection might sound bold, but it’s backed by the project’s potential to revolutionize the market.”

Shifting Market Dynamics

Cardano’s steady consolidation and BinoFi’s explosive potential highlights the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. Established assets like Cardano continue to offer stability and long-term appeal, while emerging players like BinoFi represent high-risk, high-reward opportunities for growth-oriented investors.

For 2025, the question for investors boils down to their risk appetite. Will you back Cardano’s proven resilience or leap into BinoFi’s bold ambitions to capture the kind of exponential gains rarely seen in the market? With excitement brewing and speculation running high, now might be the moment to decide.

Liquid Mercury’s solution will power the global order book for trading tokenized wine on the dVIN Protocol

https://blockonomi.com,Is Rexas Finance (RXS) Positioned to Overtake Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the Next Bull Run?,https://blockonomi.com/is-rexas-finance-rxs-positioned-to-overtake-shiba-inu-shib-in-the-next-bull-run/,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:36:07 GMT","With a daily trade volume of $252.21 million and a price of $0.000014 as of right now, maintaining a market worth of $8.40 billion and ranking 17 on CoinMarketCap, the token has witnessed a 2.92% price rise over the past 24 hours. Notwithstanding this, the introduction of Rexas Finance (RXS), a novel Real-World Asset (RWA) token, begs the issue of whether it may outperform Shiba Inu in the next bull run. Rexas Finance already shows a price increase of almost 6x from its presale stage to its present level, so its growth path indicates it might challenge and even surpass SHIB.



Rexas Finance (RXS) – The Gateway to Asset Management Innovation

Rexas Finance (RXS) marks the future of asset management, not only another cryptocurrency. The concept presents a decentralized environment where users may easily tokenize and trade actual assets, generating countless investment prospects. Unlike Shiba Inu, which mostly depends on its meme-driven popularity and community involvement, Rexas Finance delivers actual value by letting people safely own, fractionalize, and exchange physical and digital assets. Rexas Finance, priced at $0.20, is in its final presale stage (Stage 12). With over $46.81 million raised and 90.82% of its presale allocation filled, anticipation for its launch is at an all-time high. Set at $0.25, the official listing price; the launch date is announced on June 19, 2025. Early presale participants have already witnessed over 500% gains, reinforcing RXS as a fierce competitor in the crypto space.

Investor Interest and Presale Success

The presale performance of a project is one of the main measures of its possible success; Rexas Finance has exceeded expectations in this respect. The token’s capacity to draw high degrees of investment reveals great market confidence. With around 1.56 million entries recorded, the ongoing $1 million giveaway has generated more curiosity. Investors who participate in the presale with a minimum of $100 complete tasks and refer others to receive additional entries. This aggressive marketing approach has greatly expanded the RXS community, and the token is positioned for a strong market introduction. Rexas Finance has real use cases that motivate its acceptance, unlike Shiba Inu, which depends on speculative trading and market hype. The growing interest in tokenized assets and the expansion of the RWA industry position RXS in a prime position to observe exponential demand.

Market Potential and Future Growth

Social media trends, celebrity sponsorships, and speculative trading have mostly driven Shiba Inu’s success. While this has favored meme coins in past market cycles, they frequently find it difficult to sustain long-term value without robust foundations. Through initiatives like Shibarium, SHIB’s ecosystem has tried to add more value, but its price is still somewhat erratic, mostly based on market attitude. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, is constructed based on practical application. Beyond mere speculation, the capacity to tokenize and trade assets, including real estate, art, commodities, and intellectual property, gives RXS inherent worth. This guarantees long-term price appreciation and steady demand, particularly as the larger market embraces tokenized assets. Experts estimate that once RXS is listed on major exchanges, it may see a huge surge. Its presale momentum and strong investor support help it position itself to top SHIB’s market cap in the next bull run. If RXS tracks its expected course, early investors could experience gains substantially greater than Shiba Inu holders.

Will Rexas Finance (RXS) Overtake Shiba Inu (SHIB)?

With its excellent foundations, strategic presale expansion, and special position in the RWA sector, Rexas Finance (RXS) is becoming a major rival to Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the next bull market. With real-world asset-backed cryptocurrencies changing investor attitudes, RXS finds a good position because it provides actual utility and a sustainable development pattern. Shiba Inu’s established community and past price swings help it remain a powerful competitor in the market. However, its dependence on hype and speculation makes it sensitive to market declines. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, offers a forward-looking investment opportunity based on a strong asset tokenization foundation. Investors seeking tokens with exponential potential want the crypto market to be ready for its next significant bull run. Given its presale performance, technological innovation, and strategic market positioning, Rexas Finance (RXS) could surpass Shiba Inu (SHIB), guiding investors looking for long-term value and maximum returns.

This momentum is attracting the attention of analysts who believe the rally is far from over.

As AI adoption skyrockets and decentralized intelligence gains traction, both TAO and INTL are poised for substantial growth. Investors are now left wondering: is this just the beginning of a much larger movement? Keep reading to find out.

TAO’s Potential Surge To $1,000 Shows Bittensor’s Strength In The DeFi AI Industry

Bittensor’s recent price action has captured significant attention in the crypto market, fueled by a bounce and a wave of new developments in the decentralized AI space. Although Bittensor has recently made it onto the list of top crypto gainers, the TAO token remains confined within a descending channel.

A minor bullish engulfing pattern has formed on TAO price charts, but Bittensor hasn’t pushed high enough to break free. Nevertheless, a breakout for TAO could be on the horizon, supported by several compelling factors.

One major factor is President Trump’s $500 billion investment plan for AI development. While the funds focus on centralized AI, it could bring up conversations about the importance of decentralized AI, which is a space where Bittensor is already making its mark.

Another factor is the recent partnership between Zuvu AI and Vana, aimed at enhancing decentralized artificial intelligence within Bittensor. Their objectives include establishing a more open and financially sustainable AI ecosystem. If these elements align, the Bittensor price could start climbing again. Under the right market conditions, hitting the $1,000 mark for TAO doesn’t seem out of reach.

Can IntelMarkets Develop The AI Crypto Industry Just Like Bittensor Has?

IntelMarkets is leveling the playing field in the DeFi market by giving everyday traders access to AI tools once reserved for hedge funds and big institutions. To do this, IntelMarkets ensures that top-tier trading bots and real-time whale movement alerts are available to these small-time traders, enabling them to make quicker, smarter, and more profitable trades.

Moreover, the platform goes the extra mile by focusing on education, offering a rich library of articles, webinars, and courses. These resources break down complex investment strategies into practical, easy-to-understand lessons, so traders don’t just follow trends, they actually know what they’re doing.

Security is another area where IntelMarkets shines. The platform uses a powerful security system called Codeum which ensures that users’ assets stay safe from hackers and third parties. Every transaction is protected which gives traders peace of mind as they grow their investments.

In addition to its incredible trading tool and security system, IntelMarkets is also powered by its native INTL token. IntelMarkets users who hold INTL get to enjoy lower trading fees of up to 30%. The token is also a golden ticket to early feature access, a say in platform’s decisions, and a chance to climb the INTL Leaderboard, where over 12,000 traders compete for rewards and bragging rights.

Currently, IntelMarkets is in Stage 10 of its presale, with INTL tokens priced at $0.092, which is a steal compared to the $0.42 launch price. With experts predicting it could reach the market cap of Bittensor, early buyers could see a jaw-dropping 20,000% gain.

While ADA remains a strong performer in the crypto market, its whales are diversifying into MUTM. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is lining up to be a leading DeFi performer. Now in round three of its presale, the fast-growing altcoin is priced at $0.02 and has already amassed nearly $3.6 million worth of funding. More than 5,800 investors have gotten ahead of an anticipated 25% price increase, with the price set to increase to $0.025 in the next stage. Those who get in at this stage can realize a 200% profit at launch when it launches at $0.06.

Analysts predict that MUTM could soar 11,330% in 2025, reaching $2.28 per token. The Mutuum Finance team is also undergoing its smart contract audit by CertiK, a vital step in establishing security and trust. Upon completion, the audit report will be posted officially on their social media.

A DeFi Powerhouse Gaining Traction

Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending with its groundbreaking dual-lending structure, fueling its rapid adoption. During its presale, over 5800 investors have backed the project with $3.6 million, recognizing its potential. The Mutuum Finance token has already reached $0.02 in Phase 3, and with an imminent 25% price jump in Phase 4, investors in this stage are well-positioned for substantial gains. Making it one of the most undervalued yet high-potential DeFi projects, with its unique lending features and strong market demand, analysts anticipate the token to exceed $5 following its launch at $0.06.

Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing DeFi lending by integrating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) as well as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Through the P2C model, customers can gain passive income by being part of USDT liquidity pools while having smart contract-based automatic lending. P2P is a method that provides direct lending where customers are able to do business without the involvement of intermediaries and remain in full possession of their capital. By this combination of two systems, Mutuum Finance provides greater security, efficiency, and decentralization as a potential investment vehicle for high-yielding DeFi investors.

Mutuum Finance is actively driving community growth with lucrative investor rewards. A million-dollar giveaway will distribute $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens to 10 fortunate participants, while an innovative referral program incentivizes users for bringing in new investors. Early adopters also gain access to exclusive staking pools, governance rights, and VIP updates, fostering long-term engagement with the platform.

Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth

The project’s tokenomics model is designed to ensure controlled supply and long-term price appreciation. Limiting the distribution of the tokens during presale and adding deflationary pressures, Mutuum Finance ensures scarcity, thus the potential for long-term price appreciation. In addition, its staking mechanism guarantees high reward incentives and active participation with the token building long-term functionality and a healthy ecosystem.

Cardano (ADA) whales are strategically shifting their investments into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), recognizing its potential as a high-growth DeFi project. Over 5,800 investors have already contributed $3.6 million, and the presale price is set to rise from $0.02 to $0.025, offering early adopters a lucrative opportunity. Analysts predict an 11,330% surge, with MUTM expected to reach $2.28 in 2025. The ongoing CertiK audit further strengthens investor confidence, positioning Mutuum Finance for long-term success.

With SOL hovering around $145 and ADA near $0.68, these established platforms have been the dominant forces in smart contracts and DeFi. Yet, analysts are keeping a close watch on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been steadily capturing the interest of crypto enthusiasts. During Phase 3 of its presale, MUTM has received $3.4 million from over 5,700 investors, and participants in this phase will lock in a 200% gain when the token lists at $0.06.

Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates in Phase 3

Mutuum Finance’s third presale phase is underway, drawing a surge of investor support thanks to its DeFi-focused model that offers a long-term, stable alternative to hype-driven meme tokens. Investor confidence remains strong, with more than $3.4 million raised and over 5,700 holders committing to the project.

Throughout Phase 3, the token is priced at $0.02, with plans to list at $0.06—delivering an immediate 200% increase for current buyers. Moreover, some analysts anticipate an eventual climb to $1.50 upon listing, translating to a possible 25x return. The upcoming Phase 4 will lift the token price again to $0.025, prompting further urgency among prospective investors.

Transforming DeFi Lending with a Dual-Model System

Mutuum Finance aims to provide a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity platform that grants full control to users. Through this system, participants can earn passive income by lending, while borrowers receive near-instant access to liquidity—secured by assets that exceed the loan’s value. Automated interest rate adjustments are built in to sustain the network’s capital efficiency and stability.

At the heart of Mutuum Finance’s approach is a dual-lending framework, combining:

Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Smart contracts manage lending pools, automatically fine-tuning interest rates based on market conditions. This model gives lenders reliable yields while helping borrowers secure funds with minimal friction.

Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Removing middlemen altogether, lenders and borrowers set up direct loan agreements, maximizing flexibility for assets that can be volatile.

To bolster security and transparency, all smart contracts are open-source and regularly audited. Further strengthening token value, a buyback mechanism is in place, offering both price appreciation and passive income to MUTM holders. Moving forward, Mutuum Finance plans to expand across multiple chains—both EVM-compatible and otherwise—to enhance liquidity and accessibility.

$100,000 Giveaway and Community Incentives

Mutuum Finance encourages greater adoption by hosting a $100,000 giveaway, awarding $10,000 in MUTM to ten lucky winners. A referral program also rewards those who introduce new community members, fueling organic growth and robust user engagement.
