Ancient hunter-gatherers from Europe may have voyaged across the Mediterranean to Northern Africa around 8,500 years ago, new research suggests. Ancient DNA collected from the remains of Stone Age individuals from the eastern Maghreb region, which spans Tunisia and northeastern Algeria, revealed that they may have descended, in part, from European hunter-gatherers, according to a paper published March 12 in the journal Nature . These results represent the first clear genetic evidence of contact between early European and North African populations, indicating that Stone Age European hunter-gatherers and North Africans may have interacted more than we initially thought. "Several decades ago, some biological anthropologists proposed that European and North African hunter-gatherers had made contact, based on morphological analyses of skeletal traits," study co-author Ron Pinhasi , an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Vienna, said in a statement . "At the time, this theory appeared overly speculative," he added. "However, 30 years later, our new genomic data has validated these early hypotheses. The Stone Age began with the use of stone tools about 3 million years ago (before modern humans existed) and ended about 5,000 years ago in parts of North Africa and Europe with the rise of metal tools and early civilizations .

Before now, archaeologists didn't know much about the transition to farming in North Africa, with most genomic data coming from sites in the far western Maghreb (modern-day Morocco). Previous research in the western Maghreb found that people in this area had high levels of European farmer ancestry — genetically distinct from hunter-gatherers — reaching up to 80% in some populations due to the movement of farmers via the Gibraltar Strait around 7,000 years ago. Traces of volcanic glass or obsidian from Pantelleria, an island in the Strait of Sicily, was also found at one of the sites, indicating that these hunter-gatherers may have stopped off at several islands on their journey across the sea.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Or have a private conversation in public without other people hearing you? Our newly published research introduces a way to create audible enclaves – localized pockets of sound that are isolated from their surroundings. In other words, we’ve developed a technology that could create sound exactly where it needs to be. The ability to send sound that becomes audible only at a specific location could transform entertainment, communication and spatial audio experiences. Certain audio technologies, such as parametric array loudspeakers, can create focused sound beams aimed in a specific direction. However, these technologies will still emit sound that is audible along its entire path as it travels through space. Because ultrasound can penetrate through many materials and interact with objects in unique ways, it’s widely used for medical imaging and many industrial applications. In our work, we used ultrasound as a carrier for audible sound. It can transport sound through space silently – becoming audible only when desired. Normally, sound waves combine linearly, meaning they just proportionally add up into a bigger wave. However, when sound waves are intense enough, they can interact nonlinearly, generating new frequencies that were not present before. This is the key to our technique: We use two ultrasound beams at different frequencies that are completely silent on their own. But when they intersect in space, nonlinear effects cause them to generate a new sound wave at an audible frequency that would be heard only in that specific region. Crucially, we designed ultrasonic beams that can bend on their own. Normally, sound waves travel in straight lines unless something blocks or reflects them. However, by using acoustic metasurfaces – specialized materials that manipulate sound waves – we can shape ultrasound beams to bend as they travel. By precisely controlling the phase of the ultrasound waves, we create curved sound paths that can navigate around obstacles and meet at a specific target location. The key phenomenon at play is what’s called difference frequency generation. This means you can deliver audio to a specific location or person without disturbing other people as the sound travels. For example, museums could provide different audio guides to visitors without headphones, and libraries could allow students to study with audio lessons without disturbing others. In a car, passengers could listen to music without distracting the driver from hearing navigation instructions. Offices and military settings could also benefit from localized speech zones for confidential conversations. Despite these hurdles, audio enclaves present a fundamental shift in sound control. By redefining how sound interacts with space, we open up new possibilities for immersive, efficient and personalized audio experiences.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Four species of iguana populate Fiji — including this crested iguana (Brachylophus vitiensis) — but all are thought to descend from ancient iguanas that made a very long journey across the ocean. "You could imagine some kind of cyclone knocking over trees where there were a bunch of iguanas and maybe their eggs, and then they caught the ocean currents and rafted over," lead author Simon Scarpetta , lead author and assistant professor of environmental science at the University of San Francisco, said in a statement. "That they reached Fiji directly from North America seems crazy," study co-author Jimmy McGuire , professor of biology at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement. "But alternative models involving colonization from adjacent land areas don't really work for the time frame, since we know that they arrived in Fiji within the last 34 million years or so." Related: Labord's chameleon — the color-changing lizard that drops dead in 4 months Others have suggested the lizards could have floated shorter distances from South America and through Antarctica or Australia before finally ending up in the Pacific. But these ideas were based on past genetic analyses that did not conclusively show how closely Fiji iguanas were related to other iguanids. One of Fiji's reptiles — the Central Fijian banded iguana (Brachylophus bulabula) — clings to a tree. This might have been how his ancestors first made it to the remote islands. "Iguanas and desert iguanas, in particular, are resistant to starvation and dehydration, so my thought process is, if there had to be any group of vertebrate or any group of lizard that really could make an 8,000 kilometer journey across the Pacific on a mass of vegetation, a desert iguana-like ancestor would be the one," Scarpetta said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Volunteers and residents clear up wreckage after mobile home was hit by a tornado on March 16, 2025 in Calera, Alabama. A string of deadly tornadoes, violent dust storms and fast-moving wildfires ripped across several midwestern and southern U.S. states over the weekend, leaving at least 42 people dead, according to CNN . Many of the deaths have occurred outside Tornado Alley , with at least six fatalities reported in Mississippi and three reported in both Arkansas and Alabama. This follows a pattern previously predicted by long-range forecasters at AccuWeather, which warned of an eastward-shift in tornado risk this year. This forecast is concerning because more people are in harm's way, compared to Tornado Alley," AccuWeather lead long-range expert Paul Pastelok said in a statement . "More people live in the Mississippi and Tennessee valleys, and more of those families are in vulnerable buildings without basements like mobile homes." "This area encompasses much of northern Texas northward through Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and parts of Louisiana, Iowa, Nebraska and eastern Colorado," AccuWeather senior meteorologist Dan Kottlowski said in a statement . Related: 'Winter is far from over': Polar vortex reversal could bring springtime snow to US However, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) this nickname can be misleading as tornadoes can occur anywhere in the U.S. — and tornado threat shifts at different times of the year and under different weather patterns.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors In the U.S., tornado season usually begins in early March when cold air from Canada clashes with warm, moist air from the Gulf. Pastelok said that this year's eastward shift in tornado risk is due to a large and persistent area of high pressure that is expected to hover over the Southwest this spring, limiting the severity of thunderstorms, and thus tornado risk, in the Western Plains. According to the National Weather Service (NWS), two EF4-strength tornadoes — indicative of "devastating" damage — ripped through Arkansas on Friday. Meanwhile, winds topping 80 mph (129 km/h) were reported across the Southern Plains on Friday, with three people killed in car crashes attributed to dust storms in Texas. Wind-driven wildfires have also caused extensive damage across Texas and Oklahoma, with the latter reporting more than 130 fires, according to state Governor Kevin Stitt. As well as increasing the frequency of tornadoes, our warming atmosphere may also contribute to more impactful and dangerous thunderstorms, AccuWeather senior meteorologist and climate expert Brett Anderson said in the statement. "As water temperatures continue to increase in the Gulf, warmer air with more moisture can be forced northward into the Southern states ahead of a cold front, providing an extra boost of energy for severe thunderstorms that can produce tornadoes."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

"This is something we've never seen before," Billy Collett, park manager at the Australian Reptile Park, where the snake lives, said in a statement emailed to Live Science. This means it has a much larger venom output per bite than is usual for a death adder, making it even more deadly. Related: 'Truly primal': Watch Burmese python swallow deer whole in Florida Everglades by stretching its mouth to the absolute limit Death adders (Acanthophis) are a group of venomous snakes native to Australia and New Guinea. Their venom contains neurotoxins that can cause paralysis and even death if left untreated. This snake is part of Australian Reptile Park's antivenom production program, and its extremely rare extra fang was discovered when it was being milked for its venom . This involves gently squeezing a snake's venom glands while it bites onto a collection container, causing the venom to pour into the vial. This three-fanged death adder was found to produce far more venom than usual, with "massive yields" coming out of all three fangs. This is the first three-fanged snake ever discovered at the Australian Reptile Park, which has been operating for 20 years and has milked hundreds of thousands of snakes, a spokesperson for the park told Live Science in an email. "There have been other 3 fanged snakes found in Australia, but from what we can find, there have been no 3 fanged death adders recorded," they said. Similar to human adult teeth, death adders have replacement fangs growing behind the active ones, so when a fang is lost, a new one moves forward to take its place. This ensures that their fangs remain sharp and functional for injecting venom. "It's normal for death adders to shed fangs over time and replace them with new ones every few months or so," the spokesperson said. "Unfortunately, we don't actually know what has caused the 3rd fang to develop and don't currently have the facilities to run any tests."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A pair of NASA astronauts stuck aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for more than nine months will return to Earth on Tuesday (March 18) at the earliest, NASA has said. Wilmore and Williams arrived at the ISS in June as part of Boeing's first Starliner Crew Test Flight. But a number of issues with Boeing's spacecraft — including five helium leaks and five failures of its reaction control system (RCS) thrusters — led to the mission being abandoned and the duo's time in space extended from eight days to nearly 300 . "The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favorable weather conditions expected for later in the week," NASA wrote in an announcement on Sunday (March 16). Related: NASA offers SpaceX $843 million to destroy the International Space Station If everything goes according to plan, Wilmore and Williams will ride home on the Crew-9 Dragon capsule, called "Freedom", alongside fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov — half of the usual Crew-9 crew to allow space for the Starliner duo. And it's also one that can have deleterious effects on the human body, causing the heart, bones and muscles to shrink over time under low gravity. These are well known side effects of long-term spaceflight that all astronauts must face, and not related to the extension of Wilmore and Williams' mission. To mitigate them, the astronauts have been doing two hours of resistance and endurance training every day. "Mission managers will continue monitoring weather conditions in the area, as Dragon's undocking depends on various factors, including spacecraft readiness, recovery team readiness, weather, sea states, and other factors," NASA wrote in its update.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/changement-climatique-les-forets-ont-elles-besoin-de-nous-pour-sadapter-252098'>Climate change: Do forests need us to adapt?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 15:36:47 <p>
Mais ces derniers suffiront-ils face au changement climatique en cours ? Le mot atténuation, lui, est beaucoup moins présent pour parler des émissions de gaz à effet de serre et des pressions que l’on fait peser sur les écosystèmes. Adaptation et atténuation sont deux actions dépendantes, l’une n’exclut pas l’autre, mais rappelons toutefois que le GIEC a estimé qu’il nous coûterait vingt fois plus cher de nous adapter sans atténuation que d’arriver à la neutralité carbone. Malgré cette réalité, l’idée de s’adapter a bien du succès, mais si on se place sur le temps long, elle peut sembler étonnante. En effet, être adapté à notre environnement, à notre climat, nous l’étions depuis l’apparition de notre civilisation, car le climat n’a subi que de faibles variations depuis cette époque, en comparaison de ce qui nous attend. Tous les êtres vivants vont devoir s’adapter et sont déjà en train d’essayer de le faire, chacun à sa vitesse, grâce à la sélection naturelle et la diversité génétique dont celle-ci se nourrit. Les populations d’arbres elles aussi s’adaptent aux nouvelles conditions climatiques, mais réussiront-elles à le faire avant de disparaître ? Certains répondront que c’est impossible et qu’il faut donc accélérer la récolte des forêts actuelles et la plantation d’un milliard de nouveaux arbres, espère-t-on mieux adaptés aux conditions futures. Ces nouveaux arbres, certains proposent d’aller les chercher chez d’autres espèces qui n’existent pas en France et qui vivent dans des climats plus chauds et plus secs tels que le chêne zéen, les sapins de Turquie, l’eucalyptus. Ces solutions posent aussi de nombreuses réserves soulevées par les scientifiques. Mais soyons clairs : il n’y aura pas de solution miracle universelle, il faudra diversifier les options comme les forêts elles-mêmes, indispensables de bien des façons à notre bien-être. Le temps forestier face à la vitesse du changement climatique Mais aujourd’hui, les forêts doivent faire face à un bouleversement inédit, le réchauffement climatique, qui a connu une très nette accélération ces dix dernières années en France. Un arbre peut-il s’adapter à des conditions changeantes au cours de sa vie ? Penser le futur des forêts nécessite donc d’anticiper l’évolution attendue du climat, en tenant compte des incertitudes, mais également de prendre en compte les capacités d’adaptation propres à chaque arbre au cours de sa vie. Le fonctionnement d’un arbre dépend des conditions dans lesquelles il se trouve, il peut s’ajuster en quelques minutes à un changement de luminosité par exemple. Mais malheureusement, cette plasticité a des limites qui ont maintenant été atteintes dans de nombreuses régions. Puisque les limites vitales sont atteintes, certains prônent par exemple de réduire la densité d’arbres afin de diminuer la compétition pour l’eau. L’adaptation par la sélection naturelle peut-elle être rapide chez les arbres ? Les arbres sont parmi les organismes vivants ayant la plus grande diversité génétique, non seulement à l’échelle de leurs aires naturelles (celle du Pin sylvestre s’étend de la Sibérie à l’Andalousie, sous des climats bien différents), mais aussi à l’intérieur de chaque peuplement. Les études rétrospectives de telles forêts révèlent une capacité d’adaptation à de nouvelles conditions après seulement une à quelques générations d’arbres. Ainsi chez le Pin maritime, espèce globalement sensible au froid, on a observé que les descendants d’arbres survivants de plantations artificielles faites dans le Nord-Est de la France étaient plus résistants au froid que les plants issus des forêts de l’aire naturelle. Cette capacité d’adaptation génétique rapide est aussi mise à profit dans les programmes de sélection : le Pin radiata, qui a une aire naturelle extrêmement réduite à quelques populations de la côte Californienne sous un climat doux et humide, est devenu en quelques décennies l’une des essences les plus largement plantées sur tous les continents y compris sous des climats plus secs ou continentaux. Des études génétiques menées sur différents arbres tempérés et tropicaux ont montré qu’au sein d’une forêt, chaque arbre est adapté à son micro-environnement. Ainsi, on a montré que les populations d’arbres situées à différentes altitudes d’une même montagne peuvent avoir des spécificités génétiques adaptatives : plus adaptées au froid en altitude et à des conditions chaudes et sèches en basse altitude. Dans la hêtraie du Mont Ventoux (Vaucluse) par exemple, on trouve des arbres qui démarrent leur croissance rapidement au printemps avant la sécheresse estivale mais courent le risque de subir les gels printaniers, et des arbres qui démarrent plus tardivement mais sont plus tolérants à la sécheresse. Au fil des générations, les mécanismes de la reproduction sexuée réorganisent en partie le patrimoine génétique transmis par chaque arbre à ses descendants en générant de nouvelles combinaisons génétiques originales qui seront soumises à leur tour aux processus de sélection : c’est l’un des mécanismes permettant le maintien d’une diversité génétique malgré la sélection naturelle. Chez les arbres, qui ont un cycle de vie long et dispersent loin leur pollen et leurs graines, les facteurs de sélection changent dans le temps et varient dans l’espace, ce qui contribue aussi au maintien d’une grande diversité génétique, et donc d’un potentiel d’adaptation, au sein de chaque population. Mais l’action de la sélection naturelle trouve ses limites dans les contraintes du fonctionnement physiologique des plantes et est parfois entravée par un manque d’arbres reproducteurs, un manque de diversité génétique, des événements catastrophiques de grande ampleur, des parasites émergents, etc. Il est donc bien difficile et hasardeux de prédire la capacité d’adaptation future d’une forêt particulière et de se reposer simplement là-dessus. On peut néanmoins raisonner l’impact des pratiques de gestion sur les mécanismes d’adaptation. Du lundi au vendredi + le dimanche, recevez gratuitement les analyses et décryptages de nos experts pour un autre regard sur l’actualité. La sylviculture peut en effet piloter les mécanismes de sélection naturelle eux-mêmes. Cependant, le choix des arbres conservés lors de ces éclaircies se fait sur la base d’objectifs de gestion (on garde les plus beaux arbres, qui ne sont pas toujours les plus résistants à la sécheresse notamment si le peuplement a été peu soumis au stress). On comprend bien alors qu’il y a un compromis à trouver entre réduire le stress subi par une forêt et favoriser son adaptation génétique par sélection naturelle (une option peut être de laisser agir la sélection au stade jeune avant de réduire le stress dans les stades plus avancés). Le forestier peut agir sur cette diversité en maintenant un nombre suffisant d’arbres semenciers, et en les laissant se reproduire sur plusieurs années pour compenser les aléas qu’il peut y avoir dans sa production de fruits. Des interventions bien raisonnées peuvent accélérer les processus d’adaptation sans nuire aux fonctions attendues de la forêt (production, protection, récréation, etc. ), tandis que des interventions mal raisonnées peuvent au contraire freiner ces processus, voire prendre la direction d’une maladaptation. Laisser de la place aux processus naturels garantit une adaptation flexible face à des pressions imprévues (par ex. Une stratégie de pilotage des processus naturels d’adaptation, éventuellement complétée par des apports de diversité génétique nouvelle dans certains cas mais pas systématiquement, rentrerait parfaitement dans le cadre des « stratégies de gestion adaptative » : un terme, parfois mal compris, qui signifie que la stratégie elle-même est continûment évaluée et au besoin réajustée. Dans un cadre élargi considérant les forêts comme des socio-écosystèmes, les stratégies de gestion adaptative se raisonnent en fonction du contexte local, à l’échelle de territoires (par exemple dans les Chartes Forestières de Territoires), mais le pilotage dynamique des processus d’adaptation n’est pas encore bien intégré dans ces stratégies.

On Saturday, March 29, two weeks after a total lunar eclipse was visible to all of North America, skywatchers will be treated to a spectacular event that has not been seen from anywhere since last October: a solar eclipse. During this eclipse, which is expected to be one of the best skywatching events in 2025 , observers in eastern Canada and the northeastern U.S. will be able to witness a partially eclipsed sunrise. This event will be a deep partial solar eclipse; about 93% of the sun's disk will be blocked by the new moon. As such, it will be a near — but not quite — total solar eclipse . People in northwestern Russia can watch the eclipse late in the day, with a partially eclipsed sunset occurring over remote areas of Siberia. Where and when will the solar eclipse be visible?

When teachers have the feeling of undergoing their environment without being able to control it, the risk of exhaustion increases. How to rethink school spaces taking into account their point of view? Adapted architecture can thus become a lever to improve the quality of life at school for all (including teachers), while promoting better learning conditions for students. Their well-being is not a secondary luxury: it constitutes a fundamental factor for themselves, but also for the quality of teaching and the success of students.

This syndrome, conceptualized by Christina Maslach and her colleagues, manifests itself by deep emotional fatigue, cynicism or detachment from work, and a feeling of personal ineffectiveness. ), but organizational and environmental factors play a key role, in particular, the lack of control over his work maintains exhaustion. When teachers have the feeling of undergoing their environment without being able to control it, the risk of exhaustion increases. Conversely, when professionals have the capacity to exercise professional autonomy, their commitment increases. Admittedly, the latter facilitate informal exchanges-as are the Open-Plan Schools encourage interactions-but they also present well-documented pitfalls in work ergonomics. However, human beings experience the need to appropriate their work environment. The surveys carried out by the French Ministry of Labor (Dares) show that work in an open set is perceived as more intense and more controlled, leaving less autonomy to the employees concerned. If the analogies with the tertiary sector have their limits - a teacher cannot "teleworked" his class from home or arrange his school as he pleases, for example - few similar initiatives have emerged in education. It is only recently that the situation begins to change. For example, a British study in 2015 has shown that certain characteristics of the building (light, acoustics, arrangement, etc.) could explain up to 16 % of students' academic performance variations. Such data have prompted decision -makers to consider school either only as a place of teaching, but also as a global environment where students and teachers interact with space. The Ministry of National Education has launched reflections on school architecture in recent years. In short, we discover that space is not just an empty box, but indeed a silent actor of academic success and well-being at work. If school has to prepare students for the world of tomorrow, it must also offer those who make it live - teachers - an environment that meets their missions. This involves versatile classrooms, equipped with modular furniture that can be recomposed according to the activity (lectures, group work, learning by workshops, etc. The feedback indicates that this flexibility benefits students and teachers. Rethinking school so that it is really designed also for those who work there is not a vow pile, but a realistic objective of progress. And ultimately, the whole educational community will benefit from it, students in mind.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/microsoft-augmente-ses-prix-pour-deplacer-les-couts-de-lia-generative-sur-les-utilisateurs-251874'>Microsoft increases its prices to move the costs of generative AI on users</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 15:14:21 <p>
By moving the costs of large generative AI models on users, large tech companies seek to find a viable business model. Beyond that, a strategy will consist in bringing calculations not by their data centers, as is currently the case, but by computers, smartphones and other user connected watches. A change of operation that would not be without consequences. After spending a year integrating generative AI into its flagship products, Microsoft tries to enter its costs by increasing prices, inserting advertisements in products and canceling leases from data centers. Google takes similar measures, adding essential AI features to its workspace service while increasing prices. Technological companies are fully engaged in the deployment of generative AI tools, but they are still looking for a viable business model - in this case, how to charge users for these services. Last week, Microsoft canceled certain data centers leases without notice. Microsoft has also launched versions of certain products now funded by advertising. The CEO of the technology giant, Satya Nadella, has also recently suggested that AI has so far not produced a lot of value. These actions may seem strange in the current context of media threshing around AI, which is accompanied by resounding announcements such as the OPENAI Stargate data center project, worth $ 500 billion. Rather, it would be a change of strategy aimed at making the development of AI systems profitable by repercussions discreetly on consumers. From Monday to Friday + Sunday, receive the analyzes and decrypts from our experts for free for another look at the news. OPENAI, the market leader with 400 million active monthly users, spends without counting. Microsoft is the main OPENAI investor, and is currently providing the company with cloud computing services, so OPENAI expenses are also costing money in Microsoft. Thus, a single request on the most advanced models of Openai can cost up to $ 1,000 US, just in calculation. In January, OPENAI CEO Sam Altman said that even the company's 200 -dollars' subscription was not profitable. To date, a large part of the progress in terms of generative AI has been obtained by always aiming for greater. Openai describes its latest update as a "gigantic and expensive model". Nevertheless, many signs indicate today that this approach - which consists in making increasingly large models at all costs - may not even be necessary. Likewise, researchers from the Allen Institute for AI (AI2), in Seattle, and the University of Stanford claim to have caused a model for only $ 50. To summarize, it may well be that the AI ​​systems developed and provided by the tech giants are not profitable. After having invested billions in the generative AI, Microsoft tries to find the economic model that will make this technology profitable. And it is no longer possible to buy a Microsoft 365 subscription without Copilot. As we have seen, execute the calculations necessary for the operation of generative AI models in data centers is expensive. It is likely that Microsoft is therefore looking for means to do this work more directly on user devices - which moves the cost of the equipment and its operation. A strong index of this strategy is the small button that Microsoft began to put on its keyboards last year, where a button dedicated to Copilot appeared. There are advantages to push the generative AI inference work on computers, smartphones and other smart watches. When electronic waste is distributed throughout the territory, rather than concentrated in a data center, recycling is even more difficult. Finally, if Edge Computing may seem "decentralized", it can also lead to commercial monopolies on computer equipment. In the event that a handful of companies only control this transition to "relocated" generative AI on our individual electronic devices, decentralization may not be as open as it seems. As the IA infrastructure costs increase and the development of large models is evolving, an attractive strategy for AI companies is to reflect costs on consumers.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/concretement-que-peuvent-faire-les-europeens-face-a-trump-252191'>Concretely, what can Europeans do in front of Trump?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 15:14:06 <p>
But concretely, what measures should be taken, and who exactly? Is it possible to act jointly as part of an EU at 27 whose leaders do not necessarily agree on everything? Everyone expected a harder Donald Trump in his second term than in the first one, but no one had anticipated such a alignment on Vladimir Putin. In such a context, what can Ukrainian and Europeans do? They are indeed very dependent on the US military equipment, whether it be Patriot soil-to-air missiles or ammunition for anti-aircraft defense, F16 or even space intelligence. From Monday to Friday + Sunday, receive the analyzes and decrypts from our experts for free for another look at the news. The security guarantee offered to Europe by the United States as part of NATO is no longer de facto. And everyone understood that Donald Trump intends to dismantle multilateralism and international law built after the Second World War. This is also the case of the future German Chancellor Friedrich Merz who said that its "top priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible to gradually obtain real independence from the United States". Can the European Union do what it takes? Reconstructing a defense industry that would allow European armies to do without American equipment; rebuild a security architecture that no longer calls in the United States; And, finally, find new allies to preserve multilateralism and international law. But can the EU carry out such colossal sites? It will probably be necessary to go especially through ad hoc formats outside the institutions of the Union. In 2023, EU GDP was eight times more important than that of Russia. Cumulative military spending in EU countries, 326 billion euros in 2024, are 2.5 times higher than Russian military spending, despite the country's total mobilization for the war against Ukraine. The European Union has certainly just adopted, on March 6, the Rearm Europe plan, proposed by Ursula von der Leyen. But the increase in military budgets that this reform should facilitate will remain managed at a purely national level and will continue to influence the public finances of the States. There is a new common debt and the seizure of Russian assets This plan is missing from two components which would have marked a real European start: a new common debt and the seizure of some 235 billion euros in frozen Russian assets in Europe, and no longer only the interests they give off. The Hungary of Viktor Orban is this time not the only time to oppose such a seizure; This is also the case, for the moment, French and German governments, which fear that Europe will lose its ability to accommodate foreign capital. Where the EU can nevertheless already play a role, it is in terms of strengthening the defense industry, the area in which it has significant tools and means. European military aviation remains extremely dependent on the United States and if Rafale sales have increased in recent years, it is mainly outside the Union. The European drones industry remains in a stormy ... Most of the European projects of military equipment, and in particular Franco-German projects, have been fiacos so far, each of the armies seeking to preserve its specificities and to promote its own suppliers. Will the new geopolitical context allow us to finally overcome these blockages? In the military field in the strict sense as well as that of intelligence, it remains unlikely that we manage to progress significantly at 27. It will be necessary to rely above all on coalitions of voluntary countries outside the formal framework of the EU, especially as it will necessarily be necessary to associate them with non-member countries such as the United Kingdom, Norway, Turkey and even Canada or Australia. This is already the case, for example, for the project consisting in ensuring air protection in Ukraine, for the deployment of a possible interposition force in the event of a ceasefire or even to build a European anti-missile shield. Beyond that, should quickly ask the question of a sustainable security alliance capable of replacing a NATO now exceeded. This will be necessary in particular to formalize the possible extension of French and British nuclear protection to other European countries, as wished by Poland and Germany. Again, this new collective European security architecture, which will have to take over from NATO by preserving its know-how, will probably have to start outside the formal EU framework. Get closer to other allies in the United States and turn south overall Finally, the EU and other European states must urgently act to protect multilateralism and international law against Donald Trump. It will be essential, in particular, to save the Paris Agreement and the fight against climate change, by cooperating closely on this issue with China to counter the United States.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.sciencenews.org/article/iguanas-crossed-pacific-ocean-fiji'>The mystery of how iguanas crossed the Pacific Ocean may be solved</a></h2><b>Source:</b> sciencenews&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 15:00:00 <p>
Scaly sailors may have made a record-setting oceanic voyage. “It’s just a truly incredible example of long-distance dispersal,” says Ethan Gyllenhaal, an evolutionary biologist at Texas Tech University in Lubbock who was not involved with the research. There were two main hypotheses, says Simon Scarpetta, an evolutionary biologist at the University of San Francisco: Researchers thought the iguanas either drifted on vegetation rafts to Fiji from the Americas, or extinct ancestors migrated a shorter distance from Asia or Australia. Fijian iguanas are most closely related to desert iguanas (Dipsosaurus dorsalis), which live in Mexico and the American Southwest, the team found. The closest contenders appear to be other lizard groups. Rayna Bell, an evolutionary biologist at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, points out that it’s difficult to know the precise distance traveled, partially because other islands may have served as stepping-stones but since disappeared “The deeper we go [back] in evolutionary time, we’re more limited in terms of what evidence is available to us, because the planet has changed so much,” she says. Iguanas may be particularly well-suited for long trips at sea. Herbivorous iguanas may eat part of their raft while traveling or — like some species do today — go into a state of sluggishness and forgo eating altogether. They may also be resistant to heat and dehydration. Most iguana species alive today are also found on islands, and have been directly observed colonizing new islands via vegetation rafts in recent decades. For Gyllenhaal, the findings illustrate how an incredibly rare, chance event — like iguanas successfully floating across an ocean — are more likely to play out as long as millions of years of time are available.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

How this global system has shifted from ‘liberal’ origins − and where it could be heading next</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 13:01:19 <p>
The phrase “international rules-based order” has long been a fixture in global politics. Advocates argue that this framework has provided the foundation for decades of stability and prosperity, while critics question its fairness and relevance in today’s multipolar world. But what exactly is the international rules-based order, when did it come about, and why do people increasingly hear about challenges to it today? The vision was ambitious and universal: to create a global system based on liberal democratic values, market capitalism and multilateral cooperation. The idea was to replace the chaos of great power politics and shifting alliances with a predictable world governed by shared rules and norms. These institutions, alongside widely accepted norms and formalized rules, aimed to promote political cooperation, the peaceful resolution of disputes, and economic recovery for countries damaged by war. However, the vision of a truly universal liberal international order quickly unraveled. Meanwhile, the Soviet-led communist bloc established a parallel system with its own norms, rules and institutions. The communist bloc emphasized state-led economic planning and single-party rule, rejecting the liberal order’s emphasis on democracy and free markets. For a brief period, the order’s universal vision seemed within reach. By the 1990s and early 2000s, however, new cracks began to appear. This shift aimed to emphasize procedural fairness – rules that all states, in theory, had agreed upon – rather than a system explicitly rooted in liberal ideological commitments. The focus moved from promoting specific liberal norms to maintaining stability and predictability. China’s rise has brought these tensions into sharp relief. While China participates in many institutions underpinning the rules-based international order, it also seeks to reshape them. The Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank illustrate Beijing’s efforts to establish alternative frameworks more aligned with its interests. Supporters argue that the rules-based order remains vital for addressing global challenges such as climate change, pandemics and nuclear proliferation. However, ambiguity surrounds what these “rules” actually entail, which norms are genuinely universal, and who enforces them. This lack of clarity, coupled with shifting global power dynamics, complicates efforts to sustain the system. Whether it evolves further, splinters or endures as is will depend on how well it balances fairness, inclusivity and stability in an increasingly multipolar world.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Journalists report news to inform the public, while editors and opinion writers analyze and explain news, putting facts into a larger context to aid understanding. At the Post, instead of news editors making independent decisions on what to write and the perspectives they should take, Bezos tweeted, “We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets. Bezos’ decision harks back to an earlier time when editors and owners were the same person, and newspapers offered a specific interpretation of the world, not just a neutral report. While editorial writers and opinion columnists offer their opinions, these views are still expected to be grounded in journalistic principles, building from verifiable facts and comprehensively considering context to offer well-reasoned analysis. Many of today’s news editors and journalists stake their professional reputations on their obligation to truth, independent of special interests or particular ideologies. They pride themselves on reporting and explaining the news without fear or favor. After Bezos’ announcement, editorial page editor and veteran journalist David Shipley resigned from his position. Shipley told his staff he was stepping down “after reflection on how I can best move forward in the profession that I love.” Limiting the newspaper’s opinion section to a single viewpoint, critics argue, doesn’t seem to align with the Post’s slogan, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” as it stifles public discussion and purposefully turns off some of the lights. Former Washington Post editor Marty Baron told the Guardian, “If you’re trying to advance the cause of democracy, then you allow for public debate, which is what democracy is all about.” At the nation’s founding, the very first newspapers were highly partisan, supporting and receiving much of their funding from particular political parties and government subsidies. As the country and its political direction were just forming, these editor-owners felt a public obligation and duty to stake out a clear political position. There were no standards of journalistic neutrality; editor-owners framed news reports, wrote columns and published other people’s opinions based on their own particular viewpoints. Historians have thus argued that the early United States was a “nation of newspaper readers.” Unlike modern notions of journalistic impartiality, if a newspaper didn’t support a political party or remained neutral, it was dismissed by readers as either lacking morals or being too stupid to form an opinion. As newspapers of the early republic developed from reporting recycled news from other sources to guiding public discussion, the editorial thus emerged as a short opinion essay separate from reports on local speeches or foreign news. For various reasons, the partisan press gave way to a journalism that attempted wider appeal. Interestingly, this led to a growth in editorials, opinion columns and news analysis. Opinion columns written by journalists provided interpretive frameworks for readers to understand the meaning of news events. Such content provided journalists a means to show their independence from the powerful. Journalists could commit themselves to truth and verifiable facts while still asserting their independent role to contextualize news, explain its implications and guide the conversations necessary for democracy. Problems arise, however, when opinionated news outweighs fact-based reporting and people begin to mistrust all reporting they do not agree with, a psychological phenomenon known as confirmation bias. In today’s digital world, everyone can broadcast or publish their opinion, whereas fact-based reporting takes time and resources. While news analysis and thoughtful opinion can generate important social conversations and help citizens understand news, too much opinion that isn’t grounded in facts can also lead to a general atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion. This spells trouble for the good-faith understanding, open dialogue and mutual trust so vital to democracy. Perhaps Washington Post owner Bezos is simply responding to the public’s documented preference for partisanship over truth or to the profitability of partisan news. In this latest move, he has signaled that his private interest is a priority, at least for the editorial section. As a result, principled journalists may decide to leave rather than compromise their mission of public service.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In sixth-century China, a woman known to history as Empress Dowager Ling ruled over an empire called the Northern Wei. Historians do not know her birth name or in what year she was born, but they do know that she served as empress dowager between 515 and 528. She ruled on behalf of her young son, the heir to the throne; however, her regency was interrupted by a coup d'etat from 520 to 525. Although the empress dowager was expected to rule only as a regent, historical records indicate that she administered court in her own name. In my recent book, “The Women Who Ruled China,” I offer an overview of these historical sources and records that document her life, including a translation of her biography retained in the official chronicle of the Northern Wei. Using these sources, I argue that even though the Empress Dowager’s rule was problematic and short – resulting in her assassination – she laid the foundation for other, more successful female rulers across medieval East Asia. These women served in the military and advised on political matters. The Mulan legend is widely recounted in Chinese literature and inspired a fictional character in two Walt Disney movies based on the Chinese fable. As a historian of gender in this period, I believe that the Mulan legend does not accurately depict Taghbach women. Instead, it is a Chinese story that emphasizes a form of gender transgression that makes sense only within Chinese and Confucian culture. Empress Dowager Ling was not a warrior, but she embraced martial symbols of her own power that were available to women in Taghbach culture but not in Chinese culture. In the Confucian culture of Han China, such actions were considered highly inappropriate for women, but Empress Dowager Ling carried them out while holding the Chinese title of empress dowager. Simply put, what this meant was that the ruler of the empire legitimized his reign through Buddhism, portraying himself either as a Buddha or as a patron of Buddhists – their texts and institutions. Even though Buddhist statecraft was widespread in the empress dowager’s time, she was the first woman to directly legitimate her independent rule through Buddhism. As a patron of Buddhism, she commissioned majestic Buddhist architecture. Perhaps seen by her populace as a Buddhist figure herself, she symbolized her co-rule with her son by using a Buddhist visual motif of two Buddhas sitting side by side, a representation that came to be known as the rule by “Two Sages,” meaning tandem rulers depicted in the guise of buddhas. As I argue in my book, she did so by capitalizing on the idea that first her son, and then her granddaughter, were thought of as the bodhisattva Maitreya, a being of infinite compassion who is believed to be the future Buddha. Empress Dowager Ling was largely unsuccessful in her bid for power. Numerous historical sources attest to her life, work and rule. What those sources tell us, however, is that she ruled using the very same strategies as Empress Dowager Ling. She was also able to successfully establish herself as the bodhisattva Maitreya by using Buddhist texts known to Empress Dowager Ling and her court. However, she accomplished what Empress Dowager Ling could not – holding onto power successfully. I argue her success was possible because Empress Dowager Ling had paved the way.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

However, new research shows that drug deaths are dropping in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Still, opioid overdose deaths in Philadelphia remain what public health researchers call a “wicked problem.” These are complex, multifaceted challenges that are constantly changing and have no clear solution. The Conversation U.S. published several articles over the past year that sought to untangle various threads of this wicked problem in Philadelphia. Still, opioid use disorder claimed the lives of over 1,100 residents that year – more than three times as many lives as 10 years earlier. Ben Cocchiaro, assistant clinical professor of family medicine and community health at Drexel University, explains one likely reason why overdoses in Philly spiked in the first place: the unpredictable potency of the city’s street fentanyl supply. “Local drug-testing efforts found as much as a fiftyfold difference in potency between bags of fentanyl that appear identical,” Cocchiaro writes. “It’s like cracking a beer and not knowing whether drinking it will get you mildly buzzed or send you to the graveyard. Forensic testing has revealed that over 90% of street heroin and fentanyl samples in Philly now contain xylazine, an animal tranquilizer with no FDA-approved use in humans. Rachel McFadden is an emergency room nurse at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and also works at a walk-in clinic in North Philadelphia that serves people who use drugs. She says it’s also important that people’s other basic needs, including food, shelter and a place to shower, are met so they can properly heal. The combination of fentanyl and xylazine in Philly street opioids has made withdrawal symptoms far more excruciating than those experienced by heroin users in the past. London says these withdrawal symptoms lead many patients who are addicted to opioids to discharge themselves from the hospital before their treatment is complete. “Patients with opioid use disorder will often do whatever they can to stay out of the hospital due to fear of withdrawal,” he writes. “Asking how withdrawal symptoms are managed, therefore, is often their first priority when hospitalized. We see this even when they have conditions that require complicated and time-sensitive treatments. Read more: Philly hospitals test new strategy for 'tranq dope' withdrawal – and it keeps patients from walking out before their treatment is done Philadelpha’s public health department has issued health alerts about xylazine and medetomidine becoming more prevalent in the city’s street opioid supply. Researchers Karli Hochstatter and Fernando Montero at Columbia University are part of a team that tests fentanyl samples collected in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia each month. Those tests have turned up a new adulterant: an industrial chemical known as BTMPS that is used in making plastics. By November 2024, 12 of 22 samples – or 55% – contained BTMPS,” Hochstatter and Montero write. BTMPS has not been studied in humans, but rat studies reveal exposure – at far lower levels than what is found in the Philly fentanyl samples – can cause heart defects, serious eye damage and death.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/colorado-and-other-states-have-expanded-access-to-abortion-but-not-for-adolescents-249340'>Colorado and other states have expanded access to abortion, but not for adolescents</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 13:00:19 <p>
Since 2022, Colorado and 10 other states have passed voter initiatives to protect or expand abortion access. Yet, seven of these states, including Colorado, require people under the age of 18 to get consent from or notify a parent prior to receiving abortion services. In January 2025, my colleagues and I published research using in-depth interviews with 33 people ages 15 to 22 in Colorado who considered or obtained abortion care between 2020 and 2023. Our study suggests that Colorado’s parental notification law delays young people’s access to abortion, complicates already complex family relationships, and forces unwanted disclosure of the pregnancy and abortion. As a nurse, I have provided health care to young people and their families for more than two decades, and as a researcher, I have spent the past 10 years studying young people’s experiences with parental involvement laws. Three states – Kansas, Missouri and North Dakota – require involvement of both parents. In 2024, Colorado passed a constitutional amendment that protects the right to abortion and allows funding through Medicaid. Yet, Colorado still requires parental notification for people under 18 to obtain abortion services. There have been no recent state-led efforts to remove this law. Research shows this is wishful thinking: These laws do not improve communication or decision-making, and instead harm adolescents. For some Colorado young people, following the law resulted in unwanted disclosure of their pregnancy and abortion to parents and others, which is associated with negative mental health outcomes and exposes some young people to emotional or physical abuse. In states that mandate parental involvement, young people who feel they cannot involve a parent can try to obtain a judicial bypass. In some states, such as Florida, up to 13% of young people who requested a bypass were denied. In our prior research, Texas young people described the judicial bypass process as burdensome, humiliating and traumatizing. They said it disrupted school, was “embarrassing,” “anxiety” provoking and “nerve wrecking.” She took vitamin C, which is not effective, and considered but did not take large doses of over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen, which could have caused organ damage. This unwanted disclosure breached the privacy that judicial bypass is meant to protect. States such as Colorado, Maryland and Montana provide access for people seeking abortion services who live in the 18 states with bans early in pregnancy. However, these states’ parental involvement laws may compound barriers people face when traveling out of state. Policymakers in some states with abortion bans, such as Idaho, Tennessee and Mississippi, are trying to stop people from traveling out of state for services by targeting young people. These proposed laws would make it a crime to help a young person under 18 leave the state for abortion services without parental consent. Our research found that Colorado young people want their parents’ or guardians’ support when considering abortion, yet some felt it was not safe for them to ask for it. In addition to those reasons, young people also accurately predicted their parents’ reactions. Young people recounted emotional abuse and abandonment or feeling coerced into either continuing the pregnancy or having an abortion when a parent they did not feel they could tell found out about the pregnancy.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

These include actions ranging from run-of-the-mill lying , cheating and hiding their own manipulative behavior to threatening to kill a philosophy professor , steal nuclear codes and engineer a deadly pandemic . Now, a new experiment has shown that weeding out this bad behavior during the training process may be even tougher than first thought. Researchers at OpenAI tasked an unreleased model with goals that could be completed by cheating, lying or taking shortcuts. The company outlined its research in a blog post , so it has not yet been peer-reviewed. While developers can monitor and flag misbehavior, the models' "natural monitorability is very fragile," they added. Reasoning models, such as ChatGPT's o1 and o3-mini, are an upgraded version of standard LLMs that use a method called "chain-of-thought" to backtrack and reevaluate their logic , which enables them to tackle more complex tasks with greater accuracy. Related: Scientists design new 'AGI benchmark' that indicates whether any future AI model could cause 'catastrophic harm' By using a standard LLM, GPT-4o, to oversee an unreleased frontier reasoning model during training, the researchers watched as the model completed a number of coding tasks. But in some of these cases, the reasoning model found it easier and more desirable to reward hack, explicitly stating it was doing so in its chain-of-thought. In one instance, it bypassed its assigned task by terminating programs prematurely and reporting success. Because it's hard to tell if a chain of thought has been tampered with, the researchers recommend that others working with reasoning models avoid applying strong supervision to chain-of-thought processes. "Sacrificing an effective method for monitoring reasoning models may not be worth the small improvement to capabilities, and we therefore recommend to avoid such strong CoT optimization pressures until they are better understood," the researchers wrote.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

When asked about reactions to Donald Trump being president, a 16-year-old Black girl said, “I feel unsafe and not protected. These two teenagers responded very differently to the racial climate created by Trump – during his first presidency. As a scholar of adolescent development, I have studied U.S. teenagers for over two decades. Focusing on 1,400 ninth through 12th graders, I hypothesized that adolescents would become more divided during Trump’s presidency, given the political divisions evident among adults in 2016. These groups were not just different demographically; they diverged in their worldviews about race and inequality over time. Young Trump supporters also grew less aware of inequalities in society during this time frame, becoming less likely to endorse statements like “In America, certain groups have fewer chances to get ahead.” Conversely, young Trump detractors increased their race consciousness and awareness of societal inequalities during this time. This heightened interest in voting among young Trump supporters aligns with 2024’s election results. Although people ages 18-29 were more likely to support Kamala Harris than Donald Trump, the majority of white youth (54%) and young men (56%) who voted turned out to support Trump. The divergent beliefs of Trump supporters and detractors may have implications for other behaviors in addition to voting. Students were emboldened to make bigoted statements about immigrants, Muslims and other groups. Researchers documented incidents of anti-Black racism and anti-transgender discrimination in schools. Our study found that Latino youth experienced more discrimination after Trump was elected. These studies did not definitively attribute increased discrimination to actions of young Trump supporters. But young Trump supporters did become less concerned about discrimination and racial equity. Based on how people responded in the early days of Trump’s first term, these orders may directly harm adolescents and embolden discrimination again. The executive order to eliminate teaching on racial and gender equity from schools, if upheld, would limit adolescents’ opportunities to learn about racism, sexism and inequalities faced by different groups. Adolescents’ awareness of and concerns about inequalities diverged during Trump’s first presidency based on their political views. Given the policy focus of Trump’s second term, I anticipate similar or greater divisions in young people’s racial attitudes and actions than my research revealed over the course of his first term.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A historian makes the case for Babylonian astronomy</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 12:59:40 <p>
Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. It’s not just an explanation, but a system that uses observations and experiments to build theories that are recorded, passed on to others and built on. With that idea in mind, as a historian of science, my best answer to the question of what the first scientists discovered is Babylonian astronomy. What makes Babylonian astronomy stand out as being especially scientific is the careful, organized way in which Babylonian scribes – their keepers of knowledge – observed, recorded and eventually mathematically predicted the ways that the Sun, Moon, stars and planets move in the skies. Many calendars are based on the skies too. A month is about how long it takes the Moon to go through its phases. Like today’s world, Babylonia could be both predictable and chaotic. The stars and planets can seem like that, too. The stars are always in the same places in relation to one another, so you can identify constellations, and those constellations rise and set at regular times over the course of a year. But the planets move around – they’re not always in the same places, and sometimes they even seem to stop and move backward in their paths. Sometimes even more spectacular events occur, such as eclipses. They saw changes in the motions of the planets or rare events such as eclipses as signs – omens – about what was going to happen on Earth. For example, they might think the shadow of the Earth moving over the Moon in a certain way during a lunar eclipse meant that a flood would also happen. The scribes kept a book called Enūma Anu Enlil listing omens and their meanings. So if the seemingly changing motions of the heavens could be predicted, maybe earthly events could be, too. In other words, they recorded their observations of both astronomical omens and the events they might have predicted. So if Venus was somewhere on a particular day, it would be in the same place on the same day eight years later. By around the fourth century B.C.E., the scribes developed this knowledge into a system of mathematically predicting astronomical events. They made tables called ephemerides that showed when these events would happen in the future. So Babylonian scribes succeeded in their project: They made the motions of the Sun, Moon and planets predictable. MUL.APIN, the Astronomical Diaries, the ephemerides and all of Babylonian astronomy had a major impact on later astronomers, one that continues to today. Greek astronomers used Babylonian observations to make geometric models of planetary motions, part of the long path toward modern astronomy. For example, NASA has a table of eclipses online that goes to the year 3000. But the most familiar thing that comes from Babylonian astronomy is how we tell time. The Babylonians didn’t use a decimal system with units of 10 like we do. Instead, they used a sexagesimal system, with units of 60. Babylonian observations were so important that later people kept Babylonian units for astronomy, even though they used a base 10 system for other things. So if you’ve ever wondered why an hour has 60 minutes, and a minute has 60 seconds, it’s because we’ve kept that way of measuring from Babylonian astronomy. Please tell us your name, age and the city where you live. And since curiosity has no age limit – adults, let us know what you’re wondering, too.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Museums generally want to make the contents of their collections available for teachers and researchers, either physically or digitally. However, each collection’s staff has its own way of organizing data, so navigating these collections can prove challenging. And this data can feed into machine learning models or other artificial intelligence to answer big questions. Currently, even within a single research domain, finding the right data requires navigating different repositories. AI can help organize large amounts of data from different collections and pull out information to answer specific questions. As an information scientist who studies scientists’ approaches to and opinions on research data management, I’ve seen how the world’s physical collection infrastructure is a patchwork quilt of objects and their associated metadata. AI tools can do amazing things, such as make 3D models of digitized versions of the items in museum collections, but only if there’s enough well-organized data about that item available. We asked what they are doing to get their collections used by both humans and AI. All together, that information adds up to a mind-boggling amount of data. Fortunately, collection managers have been working to standardize their processes across disciplines and for many types of samples. In biological collections, the tool Specify allows managers to quickly classify specimens with drop-down menus prepopulated with standards for taxonomy and other parameters to consistently describe the incoming specimens. Similar well-established metadata and tools exist across all the sciences to make the workflow of taking real items and putting them into a machine as easy as possible. My team and I conducted 10 focus groups, with a total of 32 participants from several physical sample communities. These included collection managers across disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, botany, geology, ichthyology, entomology, herpetology and paleontology. Each participant answered questions about how they accessed, organized, stored and used data from their collections in an effort to make their materials ready for AI to use. So, an AI can collect and analyze the data from nonhuman physical collections without privacy or consent concerns. Additional research projects like our study can help collection managers build up the infrastructure they’ll need to make their data machine-ready. Human expertise can help inform AI tools that make new discoveries based on the old treasures in museum collections.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Its premise: Melting Arctic ice has released a very hungry, million-year-old megabug, and scientists and the U.S. military will have to stop it. The rampaging insect menaces America’s Arctic military outposts, part of a critical line of national defense, before heading south and meeting its end in New York City. It built bases and a line of radar stations. The movie used actual military footage of these polar outposts. Over time, the U.S. military would come to see climate change as both a threat in itself and a threat multiplier for national security. The military’s snow and ice engineering in the 1950s made it possible for convoys of tracked vehicles to routinely cross Greenland’s ice sheet, while planes landed and took off from ice and snow runways. In 1953, the Army even built a pair of secret surveillance sites inside the ice sheet, both equipped with Air Force radar units looking 24/7 for Soviet missiles and aircraft, but also with weather stations to understand the Arctic climate system. Its goal: to understand how climate had changed in the past so they would know how it might change in the future. The military wasn’t shy about its climate change research successes. He promoted ice coring as a way to investigate climates of the past, provide a new understanding of weather, and understand past climatic patterns to gauge and predict the one we are living in today – all strategically important. After 1850, carbon dioxide levels crept up slowly at first and then rapidly accelerated. It was direct evidence that people’s actions, including burning coal and oil, were changing the composition of the atmosphere. For decades, military leaders have been discussing climate change as a threat and a threat multiplier that could worsen instability and mass migration in already fragile regions of the world. Climate change can fuel storms, wildfires and rising seas that threaten important military bases. It puts personnel at risk in rising heat and melts sea ice, creating new national security concerns in the Arctic. The military understands that these threats can’t be ignored. It’s the largest military port facility in the world and sits just above sea level on Virginia’s Atlantic coast. Sea level there rose more than 1.5 feet in the last century, and it’s on track to rise that much again by 2050 as glaciers around the world melt and warming ocean water expands. Planning for the future, the Navy incorporates scientists’ projections of sea level rise and increasing hurricane strength to design more resilient facilities. By adapting to climate change, the U.S. Navy will avoid the fate of another famous marine power: the Norse, forced to abandon their flooded Greenland settlements when sea level there rose about 600 years ago. Most economists agree that it’s cheaper to act now than deal with the consequences. In my view, the military’s approach to problem-solving and threat reduction provides a model for civil society to address climate change in two ways: reducing carbon emissions and adapting to inevitable climate change impacts. It accounts for more than 70% of energy used by the federal government. In that context, its embrace of alternative energy, including solar generation, microgrids and wind power, makes economic and environmental sense. As sea ice melts and Arctic temperatures rise, the polar region has again become a strategic priority. The military knows climate change affects national security, which is why it continues to take steps to address the threats a changing climate presents.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/from-pulpits-to-protest-the-surprising-history-of-the-phrase-pride-and-prejudice-249836'>From pulpits to protest, the surprising history of the phrase ‘pride and prejudice’</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 12:59:04 <p>
By the 20th century, “pride and prejudice” became solely associated with Austen’s 1813 novel. The phrase, which has religious origins, appeared in hundreds of works before Austen was born. While 2025 marks Austen’s 250th birthday, the phrase “pride and prejudice” first appeared more than 400 years ago, in religious writings by English Protestants. While the usage began in the Church of England, other denominations, even radical ones, soon adopted it: “Pride and prejudice” appears in the writings of Nonconformists, Anabaptists, Quakers, Dissenters and other representatives of “Schism, Faction and Sedition,” as one anonymous writer called them. One early takeaway is that, amid fervent religious conflicts, various denominations similarly used “pride and prejudice” as a criticism. For the first time, regular people could buy books about history, politics and philosophy. These popular texts spread the phrase “pride and prejudice” to even more distant shores. And among the novelists, female writers were especially important. My annotated list in “Jane Austen, Abolitionist” includes more than a dozen female writers using the phrase between 1758 and 1812, the year Austen finished revising “Pride and Prejudice.” Scholars have often attributed Austen’s famous title to Burney, who used the phrase “pride and prejudice” in her novel “Cecilia.” In 1843, 30 years after the publication of Austen’s “Pride and Prejudice,” British Quaker Thomas Clarkson wrote to the General Antislavery Convention, which was meeting in London. Acknowledging that some violent abolitionists had aroused reaction, he warned his audience that “this state of feeling arises as much from pride and prejudice on the one hand, as from indiscretion or impropriety on the other.” In fact, it was one of Frederick Douglass’ favorite phrases. As was typical of Douglass, the speech ranged beyond racial inequities: “Color prejudice is not the only prejudice against which a Republic like ours should guard. The spirit of caste is malignant and dangerous everywhere. In this respect, Bennet reflects a quality that all of Austen’s heroines possess.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/le-leader-du-futur-sera-t-il-forcement-autoritaire-251381'>Will the leader of the future necessarily be authoritarian?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 11:37:49 <p>
Will these cardinal values ​​of a "good" leadership disappear as the international context evolves? The question deserves all the more to be asked than leadership models that overplay strength seem to be in tune with the times, as Donald Trump, Jean-Luc Mélenchon or Cyril Hanouna illustrate. The success and influence of these closing and controversial personalities, who do not hesitate to use aggressiveness to assert their authority and their power, seem to testify to the growing influence of an authoritarian leadership based on the balance of power and intimidation. How to explain the return of autocratic leadership generally associated with over -time? Does this renewal mark the end of benevolent leaders and the start of a new era in management? Leadership is a theme studied and taught for many years in disciplines as diverse as management, political science, history or psychology. Web of science, the most famous multidisciplinary scientific bibliographic database in the world, has been counting, since 1985, more than 120,500 scientific documents with a summary ("abstract") highlighting the terms of leader or leadership. After the Second World War, this trend will gradually give way to more human and participatory forms of leadership. Popularized by James Burns' work in the 1980s, transactional leadership and transformational leadership are two examples of theories that will emerge during this period. The transformational leader strives to inspire and motivate his teams, he establishes a bond of trust with his collaborators by encouraging them to take initiatives. Despite distinct characteristics and own perspectives, theories on leadership that emerged after the Second World War are generally in common to call into question the figure of the authoritarian leader and to recommend the use of a certain form of kindness by managers. Leaderships imbued with benevolence and compassion is thus characterized by six large key dimensions: Every Monday, receive useful information for your career for your career and everything related to the life of the company (strategy, marketing, finance, etc. Above all, the virtues of the benevolent leader promote "a feeling of security and confidence conducive to increased performance". These theories have shown that leadership was not innate, but could also be taught. Finally, other advances fueled the debates on leadership, showing that it also depended on the context and was therefore situational. In this order of idea, one can therefore wonder if the current influence of authoritarian leaders is not linked to repeated crises (environmental, health, geopolitical, economic, etc.) that have been going through our societies in recent years. Such an evolution could explain the renewal and success of a management based on the balance of power while some researchers highlight the effectiveness of authoritarian leadership, considered better suited and more efficient in times of turbulence, uncertainties and dangers. COVID-19 also profoundly changed the relationship of individuals to organizations and authority, especially among young generations. Several research has highlighted the growing lack of employees for managerial positions. In a sense, this trend echoes the remark of Mark Zuckerberg, the pattern of Meta, advocating more male energy and less diversity in businesses. If the return of authoritarian leadership therefore threatens the place currently granted to benevolence and listening, it is also indirectly carrying a male, uniform and elitist vision of leaders. And which highlights the path remaining to go in this area so that a representative leadership of the place of women and people from diversity in society can finally emerge.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Galaxies observed by the JWST with those rotating one way circled in red, those rotating the other way circled in blue. Without a doubt, since its launch, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized our view of the early universe, but its new findings could put astronomers in a spin. In fact, it could tell us something profound about the birth of the universe by possibly hinting that everything we see around us is sealed within a black hole. While around two-thirds of galaxies spin clockwise, the other third rotates counter-clockwise. In a random universe, scientists would expect to find 50% of galaxies rotating one way, while the other 50% rotate the other way. This new research suggests there is a preferred direction for galactic rotation . The observations of 263 galaxies that revealed this strangely coordinated cosmic dance was collected as part of the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, or "JADES." "It is still not clear what causes this to happen, but there are two primary possible explanations," team leader Lior Shamir, associate professor of computer science at the Carl R. Ice College of Engineering, said in a statement. "One explanation is that the universe was born rotating. That explanation agrees with theories such as black hole cosmology , which postulates that the entire universe is the interior of a black hole. Black hole cosmology, also known as "Schwarzschild cosmology," suggests that our observable universe might be the interior of a black hole itself within a larger parent universe. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors These universes would be unobservable to us because they are also behind an event horizon, a one-way light-trapping point of no return from which light cannot escape, meaning information can never travel from the interior of a black hole to an external observer. An illustration shows baby universe's sealed within the event horizons of black holes (Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva)) Black holes are born when the core of a massive star collapses. At its heart is matter with a density that far exceeds anything in the known universe. "Extremely strong gravitational forces near this state cause an intense particle production, increasing the mass inside a black hole by many orders of magnitude and strengthening gravitational repulsion that powers the bounce." The scientist continued by adding that rapid recoil after such a big bounce could be what has led to our expanding universe, an event we now refer to as the Big Bang . "It produces a finite period of cosmic inflation, which explains why the universe that we observe today appears at largest scales flat, homogeneous, and isotropic," Poplawski said. "Torsion in the gravity of an extended theory of Einstein's general relativity therefore provides a plausible theoretical explanation of a scenario, according to which every black hole produces a new, baby universe inside and becomes an Einstein-Rosen bridge, or a ' wormhole ' that connects this universe to the parent universe in which the black hole exists." Poplawski told Space.com: "It would be fascinating if our universe had a preferred axis. He added that black holes form from stars or at the centers of galaxies, and most likely globular clusters, which all rotate. Another explanation for why the JWST may have seen an overrepresentation of galaxies rotating in one direction is that the Milky Way's own rotation could have caused it. Previously, scientists had considered the speed of our galaxy's rotation to be too slow to have a non-negligible impact on observations made by the JWST.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The research is pushing ahead, with a clinical trial of DBS for treatment-resistant depression that’s just begun. The first volunteer for that study had DBS surgery in early February. You’ll also hear about a before-and-after situation for Jon and Barbara, one that involves the evolving meaning of a beloved song. Laura Sanders: Previously on The Deep End. Like, I’m still the same person. Jon: And so irritability for me was at like a six or a seven or an eight. And so, like, my perspective to them on that is it’s not that the surgery didn’t work. Barbara: Yeah, like you can’t say his old self. There isn’t that cloud hanging over us. Sanders: So now, several years out from their surgeries, the volunteers I talked with are back to their lives. I’m Laura Sanders, and this is The Deep End. When I visited, they kept offering me way too much coffee and they insisted on putting their cool lizard Lizzie on my arm. Jon also insisted on taking pictures of it so I could show my kids later. The Nelsons are having a good time. But my son, my middle son said to me after, right after, said, “You know, mom, if you’re mad at dad, you can always hide the charger.” I was like, “Oh dude. That is too far.” So yeah, we, we have a healthy sense of humor in our household, for sure. Jon Nelson talks about life with DBS, and how the treatment brought him relief from his severe depression. Sanders: This family jokes about hiding Jon’s charger and changing his settings. When I was there, their middle son rated Jon a 10 out of 10 on the embarrassment scale. I won’t even tell you what he rated his mom. They joked about how us old people don’t understand slang like rizz, and no cap and stuff that slaps. Their youngest son stumped everyone with a riddle: What’s the only state that ends with a K? He didn’t say and neither will I. So for now, the Nelsons aren’t just looking ahead to better days. As I reflect on all the people who have talked with me for this story, I keep asking myself why. Why were they so generous with their time? Why did they choose to tell me, and now all of you, about some of the hardest moments in their lives? Barbara Nelson is a private person, but even so, she’s been incredibly open about her family’s struggles. And I’m not like a super out-there person. But I feel like because we know that so many people are struggling, that the more we talk about it, the better our society is. And I just think it’s really helpful to hear as either a caregiver or if sharing my story helps a partner be more empathetic or stronger or more resilient when trying to help, then that’s really good. Because if you can let go of all the armor and the importance of the appearance that everything’s great and perfect and actually take those steps, you can get better. And your life doesn’t fall apart. Sanders: Patient 001 has the same desire to let people know about his experiences, to demystify depression, to let people know that even in the bleakest times, there’s hope. Patient 001: You’re so frustrated because you’re screaming out for help, and they just don’t understand. I really, I hope one day one kid reads what you’re writing and then he finds DBS and he’s cured because that’s what I did. Amanda: I think sharing my story is important, because it helps other people see the way. It’s kind of like a flashlight for people who are still in the dark. Sanders: Playing a role in this research was something that resonated with Amanda, too. Amanda: It’s really meaningful to me. That’s clear when she tells me about one of her drawings that she did after DBS. Amanda: But you know the song “Somewhere Over the Rainbow?” It always irritated me because I’m like, “There is no “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” It’s a pipe dream, okay? She’s like peeking out the door. Sanders: What’s it, what’s that place like, you know, if you could describe it, if you’re, if so, okay, pretend you’re showing me the picture and like, here’s your house and what is that, what’s that place? It sort of feels a little bit like that. Sanders: These outlooks make clear the importance of hope. Of a belief that things can get better. DBS is still in the research phase. It is not an FDA-approved treatment available to people who might benefit. A loved one’s depression affects their whole family. Barbara Nelson talks about how her husband’s illness and recovery changed their family. Sanders: In its current form, DBS is not simple or easy, or even something that would be a good medical choice for a lot of people. That’s what Mayberg means when she says it hasn’t scaled. But science is often slow, and it almost never happens alone. Like why does DBS seem to work for some people and not others? How specifically does it change the brain? The medical technology company Abbott is funding a study that will include a hundred people with treatment-resistant depression. They’ll be recruited from all around the United States. All of these volunteers will get DBS. For the first year, half of these volunteers will have electricity flowing, and the other half won’t. On February 6th, a brain surgeon at Mount Sinai implanted a DBS device into the brain of the very first volunteer. This new clinical trial will hopefully clarify more about DBS and who it might work for. Sanders: One of the things scientists are looking for are markers, ways to tell when someone is having a bad day or actually relapsing. Scientists are looking for these signals in their body language and facial expressions, and even in their voices. In one part of the experiment, Jon spent eight minutes twice a day recording his brainwaves, along with video journals and daily, weekly, and monthly surveys. From data like Jon’s, Mayberg and her colleagues just described one such hallmark in the brains of six people who underwent DBS for depression. And that next, better thing might not even be DBS. Mayberg: I’d like to spend my time trying to understand the biology of what we did, because it’d be a whole lot better if you didn’t need brain surgery and an implant. And I’m not the one to build a new contraption or miniaturize it or make it Bluetooth compatible. They’re using electricity, light, ultrasounds, and magnets to get signals into the brain from outside of the head. Other approaches are miniaturizing the parts that do go inside the brain and coming up with easier ways to get them in there. These approaches all have their drawbacks, but technology is always getting better. Today, the powerful device can be smaller than a matchbook, and it sits near millions of people’s hearts, keeping them beating as they live their lives. The goal with DBS is similar: small, simple, seamless. For now, Mayberg says she’s in “realistic” mode, trying to find out what’s going to work for the most people. The most fun part of this as a clinician is to have the patients focus my attention, to figure out what they’re saying. Sanders: As Mayberg reflects on her career, she’s philosophical about what she and her colleagues have done and what’s left to do. This is the experiment of a lifetime, you know? It’s even, if you, if right the second after this call I had to stop, I wouldn’t trade it for one second, but I’d sure like to see the last inning, right? Amanda’s treatment-resistant form of depression left her unable to experience simple pleasures. After DBS, she began to enjoy the smell of candles. Sanders: The Nelsons are in a better place now. Their place is full of laughter, jokes, teasing, but in a nice way. When I was visiting, their youngest son was twirling and gliding through the kitchen on inline skates, going around the loop. He made it two full loops before Barbara kicked him out. And that’s really what my focus is right now, and not trying to, like, advance in my career or have more. Like, there’s really very little that will, like, get under my skin, because I’m just so grateful for every moment. And when he had this surgery, I felt like, over those first few months was like, I don’t know how this is going to end up, but we got this. And even if that’s all we get, even if it was three months or six months of relief, that’s good. Sanders: After his surgery, Jon sent Helen Mayberg an email that he shared with me. But he told her about a before-and-after situation. Years ago, he was away at an inpatient treatment facility. Jon: I could relate to it well to my situation, pre-surgery, about fading away, losing my mojo and just overall sadness, debilitating sadness. The sadness was warming and relatable to me, though. It wasn’t a negative thing when I was sick. Jon: I now still listen to it a bunch and it’s changed into being about the joy of fighting through it all and coming out truly alive on the other side. It still captivates me, but with a new meaning and focus. With three kids and a packed schedule, Jon spends a lot of time in the car, shuttling kids to and from softball and field hockey, golf, basketball, ice hockey. On one of these drives, Jon and his youngest son were talking. The kid who would crawl back up into Barbara’s womb if he could. He’s the one who gets deep. Jon: My son, you know, driving home the other day from hockey, I always, I always call it car talk with my, my families that I coach. But he was just like, “Dad, you know, like I, I’m so happy you just kept fighting for us.” Like, just these little comments that come out of nowhere. Sanders: We’re considering a bonus episode that addresses your questions, comments, and thoughts. Please send them to us at podcasts@sciencenews.org. As we wrap up, I want to say a giant thank you to Jon, Barbara, Amanda, Emily and Patient 001. I can honestly say that I didn’t expect to laugh so much reporting a story about depression.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/whats-the-oldest-lake-on-earth'>What's the oldest lake on Earth?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> livescience&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 09:00:00 <p>
Just like the mountains, lakes on Earth can be ancient, or more than 1 million years old. By contrast, the Great Lakes formed less than 20,000 years ago. "The actual basin is much more than a mile deep," Ozersky told Live Science, including between 3.1 and 4.3 miles (5 to 7 km) of sediment at the bottom. This technique involves measuring the ratios of radioactive isotopes. In this case, limnologists analyze lake sediments for radioactive versions of cesium, lead and carbon. By understanding lake formation — and Lake Baikal's formation, in particular — researchers can get a better idea of how it has persisted for millions of years. Many lakes form as glacial features, Mark Edlund , a senior scientist and the director of aquatic research and collections at the Science Museum of Minnesota, told Live Science. "But in the grand scheme, they're very short-lived systems," Edlund said. Rift lakes form when two continental plates start moving away from each other, creating a chasm. "As a result, that site never fills in," Edlund said, which is why rift lakes can last so long.

Some of the world's other oldest lakes, like Lake Malawi (up to 5 million years old) and Lake Tanganyika (up to 12 million years old) — both in Southeast Africa — also come from rifts. "Evolution has had so much time to work in that system without being interrupted," he said. It also has the highest rate of flora and fauna endemic to its ecosystem, meaning those plants and animals aren't found anywhere else on Earth. (Although other seal species may inhabit lakes, those seals have "invaded" them through streams, Ozersky noted.) This ancient lake also hosts hundreds of species of freshwater shrimp, which gives researchers the opportunity to study speciation and diversification. Edlund also studies diatoms, which are a unicellular type of algae. These organisms pull dissolved silica from the water and turn it into biologically produced glass, which encases them. Diatoms are typically between 10 and 50 microns (about half the width of a human hair) in diameter, but Baikal's diatoms are unusually large at about 50 to 150 microns. "When we look at the diatoms in Lake Baikal, they just blow your mind," Edlund said. What's inside Earth quiz: Test your knowledge of our planet's hidden layers</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Classical and quantum researchers compete using different strategies, with a healthy rivalry between the two. This contest almost always ends as a virtual tie: When researchers think they’ve devised a quantum algorithm that works faster or better than anything else, classical researchers usually come up with one that equals it. Just last week, a purported quantum speedup, published in the journal Science, was met with immediate skepticism from two separate groups who showed how to perform similar calculations on classical machines. But in a paper posted on the scientific preprint site arxiv.org last year, researchers described what looks like a quantum speedup that is both convincing and useful. The researchers described a new quantum algorithm that works faster than all known classical ones at finding good solutions to a wide class of optimization problems (which look for the best possible solution among an enormous number of choices). Reports of quantum algorithms get researchers excited, partly because they can illuminate new ideas about difficult problems, and partly because, for all the buzz around quantum machines, it’s not clear which problems will actually benefit from them. A quantum algorithm that outperforms all known classical ones on optimization tasks would represent a major step forward in harnessing the potential of quantum computers. But at the same time, he cautioned that it’s still quite possible researchers will eventually find a classical algorithm that does just as well. The new claims “are interesting enough that I would tell classical-algorithms people, ‘Hey, you should look at this paper and work on this problem,’” she said. When classical and quantum algorithms compete, they often do so on the battlefield of optimization, a field focused on finding the best options for solving a thorny problem. What’s the best way for a delivery truck to visit 10 cities in three days? Classical methods of solving these problems, which often involve churning through possible solutions in clever ways, quickly become untenable. You need to come up with a mathematical function that passes through these points. This gives you a curved line that wiggles up and down as it moves across the page. Variations of this problem show up in various forms across computer science, especially in error coding and cryptography — fields focused on securely and accurately encoding data as it’s transmitted. When the researchers behind DQI started working on their algorithm, they didn’t even have this problem in mind. “It would have been entirely plausible for a goal-oriented researcher to start by stating the problem and then investigating whether quantum algorithms could solve it faster than classical algorithms,” said Stephen Jordan, a physicist at Google Quantum AI and one of the main architects of DQI. “Of course, for us, that’s not how it happened. We came upon it by a backward and circuitous route.” Jordan embarked on that route in 2023, when he joined Google and found out he’d be working with Eddie Farhi, a physicist at Google whose work has long focused on quantum algorithms that outperform classical ones. (Farhi was once Jordan’s doctoral adviser at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.) Jordan knew that in 2014, Farhi had made a quantum attack on an optimization problem by thinking of energy, with lower energies corresponding to better solutions. He turned to another concept built into quantum physics — recognizing everything as waves. In doing so, he could manipulate the quantum system so that bigger waves (in the form of higher quantum amplitudes) corresponded to better solutions. But there was still a huge challenge that had to be overcome. By translating an optimization problem into a quantum one, and then applying the decoding lens to it, he had stumbled into a new way to develop quantum algorithms. Together with Noah Shutty, also at Google, Jordan began testing decoding schemes, seeing how they fared against classical algorithms on various optimization problems. They needed both the right approach and a problem where it worked. “It turns out classical algorithms are hard to beat,” Jordan said. “After a few months of trying, we still had not notched up any wins for quantum.” “Maybe there is some classical method that can efficiently replicate your entire approach,” Jordan said. To assuage those fears, they consulted with Mary Wootters, a coding theory expert (and Shutty’s former doctoral adviser at Stanford University). She carefully searched for any known classical algorithm that might match their quantum speedup. The team’s checks likewise suggest that it will continue to hold. Jordan had worried that it might be too niche, with no wider applications, but Shutty recognized that this decoding problem was a variation of well-known and useful problems in encryption and other fields. “DQI cannot run on present-day quantum computers,” he said. So far, Jordan said, he expects that DQI can beat classical algorithms in those problems, too.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://undark.org/2025/03/17/stardust-geoengineering-profitable/'>How One Company Wants to Make Geoengineering Profitable</a></h2><b>Source:</b> undark&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-17 00:00:00 <p>
In July 2012, a renegade American businessman, Russ George, took a ship off the coast of British Columbia and dumped 100 tons of iron sulfate dust into the Pacific Ocean. Now a startup called Stardust seeks something more ambitious: developing proprietary geoengineering technology that would help block sun rays from reaching the planet. Geoengineering projects, even those led by climate scientists at major universities, have previously drawn the ire of environmentalists and other groups. Such a deliberate transformation of the atmosphere has never been done, and many uncertainties remain. If a geoengineering project went awry, for example, it could contribute to air pollution and ozone loss, or have dramatic effects on weather patterns, such as disrupting monsoons in populous South and East Asia. But as global temperatures rise, public and scientific sentiments are shifting. If those temperature trends continue, governments or private entities may ultimately use geoengineering to alleviate or avoid the worst impacts of extreme weather, including deadly heat waves, firestorms, and hurricanes. And whoever deploys the technology will need to keep it up for decades while pent-up greenhouse gases gradually dissipate or are removed. But, so far, Pasztor told Undark, the company has not met all of his requests. Such a deliberate transformation of the atmosphere has never been done, and many uncertainties remain. Through Eli Zupnick, a communications officer hired by the company , Yedvab never accepted Undark’s many requests for an interview. Despite Stardust’s low profile, the company rejects being referred to as “secretive.” “Publishing all the products of our research without any exception is critical,” Yedvab wrote, adding that the company is “unwaveringly committed” to publishing results “as one of the measures to gain public trust.” Stardust has not published any of its research at this time, but Yedvab stressed they will do so once “scientific validation is concluded” on all of their results. For decades, researchers have explored a variety of approaches to hacking the climate. The technique, known as stratospheric aerosol injection, requires deploying tiny, carefully- chosen particles in precise amounts. For instance, after an eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide hung in the atmosphere and measurably cooled the planet for more than a year. Thanks to studies of that volcanic activity, some scientists argue that the environmental risks of deliberately strewing sulfates in the atmosphere are well understood. Although there are potential health risks from the approach, they say, they are small in comparison to the health risks from climate change. Yedvab confirmed that they are working on the technologies, saying in a statement to Undark that any such experiment would be done in a “contained, non-dispersive manner,” meaning that its particles would not be strewn over a wide area. It also committed to publishing information about any such outdoor geoengineering tests. Yedvab said that the company has not performed any such outdoor experiments yet, but it has done “a few outdoor aerial checks.” That meant that they have tested their dispersal system “under flight conditions,” but they haven’t yet scattered their aerosols in the atmosphere. Those experimental particles do not appear to involve sulfates, meaning there is little data showing how well they might work. In his emailed statement, Yedvab confirmed the company is testing non-sulfate particles: “The ability to tailor particle properties to meet a broad set of requirements — safety, effectiveness, cost, and dispersibility — is a key advantage of our approach, giving it a distinct edge over sulfates and other candidate particles.” As Stardust continues its research and development, it has drawn scrutiny, including from Pasztor. Right now, there are no international rules or treaties that put obvious limits on this kind of work. As a result, an individual company or government can take dramatic gambles with the climate, in ways that could affect billions of lives, and it doesn’t have to get permission from anyone to do it. In September 2024, Stardust’s former climate governance consultant, Janos Pasztor, published his report on the company via LinkedIn. Pasztor’s report, which includes several recommendation sections like the one shown here, calls for the company to increase its transparency, engagement, and communication with outsiders. That would publicly lay out how they intend to conduct their research and development, including agreeing not to be involved in large-scale implementation, which would instead be under the purview of government agencies. Pasztor expected Stardust to publish this information last September or soon afterward . “They were going to publish all of that on their website. Now they are delayed,” he said during a conversation in January. In early February, while Undark was reporting this article, Stardust published a bare-bones website. Stardust has not yet released a code of conduct, which the company described to Undark as “guiding principles” that “represent a set of voluntary commitments we have adopted in the absence of a dedicated regulatory framework.” In an email sent to Undark by Zupnick, Yedvab stressed that the company complies with all applicable governmental and international regulations. Some groups, however, like the Center for International Environmental Law, say that Stardust’s efforts could violate the Convention on Biological Diversity’s de facto moratorium on geoengineering activities. “By developing and planning to commercialize solar geoengineering technology, Stardust is accelerating a reckless race and potentially violating agreements of the Convention on Biological Diversity,” said CIEL’s geoengineering campaign manager, Mary Church, in a statement in February. “We anticipate that as U.S.-led [geoengineering] research and development programs advance, the value of Stardust’s technological portfolio will grow accordingly,” Yedvab wrote.

Each week for four weeks, you’ll receive a hand-picked excerpt from our archive related to your subject area of interest. The prospect of proprietary, privately held geoengineering technology worries some experts. “Pasztor’s report is the only public thing we know about them,” she added. And that lack of transparency could come with consequences for the company, she argued, as Stardust’s approach may spark conspiracy theories about what a “secret Israeli company” is doing, and down the road, it will be much harder for people to trust Stardust. “They are operating in a vacuum, in the sense that there is no social license to do what they are trying to do.” A better approach, Talati argued in a paper published in January, is for Stardust to be communicative and build trust as early as possible, disclosing what it’s doing and with whom it’s engaging. People at Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that has long dismissed geoengineering as a “dangerous distraction,” echo Talati’s concerns and go further with their critiques of Stardust. If governments choose to use geoengineering, they may become heavily dependent on Stardust if they’re ahead of the competition — of which there currently is none, Day said. They’re only going to make money if it’s deployed by governments, and at that point they’re kind of trying to hold governments hostage with technology patents.” If any geoengineering technology goes live, it will affect the whole world. Furthermore, deploying geoengineering means using and monitoring it for as long as a century, while any abrupt adjustment or end of that deployment could be disruptive, with “termination shock” triggering dangerous global warming within months. Geoengineering research has long been entangled with national defense, said Kevin Surprise, a professor of environmental studies at Mount Holyoke College who studies the economics and geopolitics of geoengineering. Because of the longstanding connections between geoengineering research and development, the military, and Silicon Valley, Surprise argues, Stardust shouldn’t be viewed as a rogue actor. Researcher Duncan McLaren suspects the company is following a standard procurement model of the defense industry, where governments get technology from a few companies that develop it mostly in secret. Stardust said that it receives no funding from the Israeli Defense Ministry, and made clear to Pasztor that it has no connection to the Israeli government. Defense scholars and security experts don’t see geoengineering technology as a potential weapon, but they do view it as something a government might use for its advantage, and as something that would disrupt international relations, said Duncan McLaren, a researcher with the Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal at American University. McLaren suspects the company is following a standard procurement model of the defense industry, where governments get military technology from a few monopolistic companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin that develop it mostly in secret.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
