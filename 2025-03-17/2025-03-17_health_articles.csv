What sample preparation is needed for using BioAFM?

BioAFM is a label-free technique that allows measurements in both air and liquid, making it ideal for studying live cells under near-physiological conditions. Unlike other imaging methods, it does not require a vacuum, nor does it necessitate freezing, drying, coating, or microtome sectioning of samples before measurement.

For optimal results, the sample must adhere to a suitable surface substrate, such as a Petri dish, coverslip, or mica.

When measuring in liquid, the sample should be immersed in an appropriate buffer solution. To ensure high-quality imaging, it is recommended to thoroughly clean the substrate beforehand to eliminate contaminants or artifacts that could interfere with measurements.

https://news-medical.net,Researchers discover MAFB and CEBPA’s role in hypospadias pathogenesis,https://news-medical.net/news/20250317/Researchers-discover-MAFB-and-CEBPAe28099s-role-in-hypospadias-pathogenesis.aspx,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Hypospadias is characterized by an ectopic urethral opening and abnormal penile curvature, affecting approximately 1 in 200 live male births. While its origins are believed to stem from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, androgen signaling pathways are thought to play a significant role in the condition's development. Despite progress in identifying the genetic components, the precise molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in urethral development, but the specific contributions of transcription factors such as MAFB and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) have yet to be fully explored. This gap in understanding highlights the need for in-depth research to elucidate the pathways involved in hypospadias.



On September 13, 2024, a study (DOI: 10.1016/j.gendis.2024.101432) published in Genes & Diseases and led by researchers from the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University in China identified MAFB and CEBPA as crucial regulators of urothelial cell growth. By influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, MAFB and CEBPA play a significant role in the genetic mechanisms of hypospadias. This research lays a strong foundation for future studies aimed at developing targeted therapies for this prevalent congenital condition.



The study focused on the roles of MAFB and CEBPA in urothelial cell growth, utilizing human foreskin samples and mouse models. The researchers found that expression levels of MAFB and CEBPA were significantly reduced in the foreskin tissues of hypospadias patients. Using RNA sequencing and Western blot analysis, they discovered that MAFB knockdown led to suppressed CEBPA protein expression, inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and causing cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis in urothelial cells. Furthermore, MAFB overexpression promoted cell proliferation and activated the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, while CEBPA knockdown reversed these effects. These findings highlight the pivotal role of the MAFB-CEBPA axis in regulating urothelial cell growth and suggest that disruptions in this pathway may contribute to hypospadias development. The study also pinpointed potential therapeutic targets for future interventions.

Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying hypospadias. By identifying the roles of MAFB and CEBPA in urothelial growth, we have uncovered potential targets for therapeutic intervention, which could lead to improved outcomes for patients with this condition."" Dr. Xing Liu, corresponding author of the study

The discovery of the MAFB-CEBPA regulatory pathway holds immense potential for advancing the treatment and prevention of hypospadias. By targeting this pathway, researchers could develop novel therapies to correct or prevent the malformation during early development. Additionally, the study opens exciting new avenues for exploring the genetic and molecular underpinnings of other congenital disorders related to urethral development. Future research may focus on identifying additional genetic factors and environmental influences that interact with the MAFB-CEBPA pathway, further advancing our understanding of hypospadias and related conditions.",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Understanding how JAK inhibitors may increase blood clot risk,https://news-medical.net/news/20250317/Understanding-how-JAK-inhibitors-may-increase-blood-clot-risk.aspx,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Why do medications that are supposed to help patients with chronic inflammatory diseases sometimes lead to blood clots?

This is one of the questions that a team of researchers from Aarhus University has sought to answer in a study that has just been published in the journal Inflammopharmacology.

The study suggests that disturbances in the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, an important communication pathway in the body, may contribute to this side effect.

""In the study, we uncover the potential links between components of the JAK-STAK signalling pathway, blood markers in patients with blood clots, and the genetic factors that contribute to the risk of blood clots in patients. This helps improve our understanding of why we see an increased risk of blood clots when using JAK inhibitors,"" explains Stine Rabech Haysen, former medical student at the Department of Biomedicine at Aarhus University, who is the first author of the publication.

The potential of the study

In the study, researchers used publicly available data from a number of published studies about patients with blood clots and compared them with a healthy control group.

They found no direct genetic explanation, but they did find a statistically significant enrichment of genes that are subject to regulatory control of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway among genes whose expression is altered in patients with blood clots.

""Although we cannot draw definitive conclusions about the mechanistic link between the use of JAK inhibitors and the risk of blood clots, our study demonstrates the potential of using data mining to identify and shed light on possible mechanisms of drug side effects,"" says one of the study's senior authors, associate professor at the Department of Biomedicine Per Qvist.

What does this mean for patients?

Although JAK inhibitors rarely lead to blood clots, it's important to understand the mechanism behind them so that the risk can be reduced.

""For the average person, our study means that we're getting closer to understanding why some drugs can have dangerous side effects like blood clots. And going forward, our method could help identify and prevent serious side effects, potentially making drug treatment safer,"" explains the other senior author of the study, associate professor at the Department of Biomedicine Tue Wenzel Kragstrup.

The researchers will now test the method on other types of medication to see if it can be used to detect side effects more widely.",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Study examines the mechanisms behind long-term consequences of childhood stress,https://news-medical.net/news/20250317/Study-examines-the-mechanisms-behind-long-term-consequences-of-childhood-stress.aspx,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Early-life adversity affects more than half of the world's children and is a significant risk factor for cognitive and mental health problems later in life. In an extensive and up-to-the-minute review of research in this domain, scholars from the University of California, Irvine illuminate the profound impacts of these adverse childhood experiences on brain development and introduce new paths for understanding and tackling them.

Their study, published in Neuron, examines the mechanisms behind the long-term consequences of childhood stress (adversity). Despite extensive research spanning over seven decades, the authors point out that significant questions remain unanswered. For example, how do adults – from parents to researchers – fully comprehend what is perceived as stressful by an infant or child? Such conceptual queries, as well as the use of cutting-edge research tools, can provide a road map, guiding experts toward developing innovative methods and providing solutions to this pressing mental health issue.

Our research suggests that the unpredictability of a child's early environment may be just as important as more traditionally recognized forms of adversity, such as abuse or neglect. Our review has important implications for how we approach early intervention and prevention strategies."" Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, lead author, Donald Bren Professor of Pediatrics and one of the world's leading researchers in this field

She and co-author Matthew Birnie, a UC Irvine postdoctoral scholar, identify several key areas for further investigation:

What does the developing brain perceive as stressful?

Which aspects of stress most significantly influence brain maturation?

Which developmental ages are most vulnerable to adversity?

What are the molecular mediators of stress effects on the brain?

How can transient stressful experiences lead to enduring dysfunction?

One notable discovery is a novel form of early-life stress: unpredictable sensory inputs from caregivers and the environment. This factor plays a substantial role in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, even after controlling for well-known adverse childhood experiences, which are collectively referred to as ACEs.

The review highlights the limitations of current ACE scoring systems in accurately predicting individual outcomes and underscores the complexity of early-life stress. Emerging factors, such as societal and anthropogenic characteristics like inequality and pollution, are gaining recognition as potential contributors.

Animal models have been instrumental in unraveling the mechanisms underlying brain development effects. Research has revealed that different types of stress can yield distinct outcomes, influenced by the nature and timing of stress, as well as species, strain and sex variations.

At the molecular level, early-life stress can substantially alter neuronal gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. These changes may lead to long-term modifications in how the brain responds to subsequent experiences. At the circuit level, early stress can disrupt the maturation of brain networks by interfering with crucial developmental processes, including neuronal oscillations and synaptic pruning.

""We're gradually comprehending how early-life stress can 'reprogram' the brain at multiple levels, from individual molecules to entire neural circuits. This knowledge presents new avenues for targeted interventions,"" Baram said.

The review also identifies key molecular mediators of early-life stress effects, including glucocorticoids and neuropeptides like corticotropin-releasing hormones. Ongoing research is uncovering novel roles for these molecules in specific neural circuits affected by early stress.

In light of these findings, the researchers propose redefining early-life stress as ""early-life adversity"" to better encompass the diverse experiences that can impact brain development, even those not traditionally perceived as stressful.

""This review emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of early-life adversity,"" Baram said. ""By focusing on how the developing brain processes and responds to these experiences, we can develop more effective strategies to prevent and mitigate their long-term effects.""

The researchers suggest increased funding for and attention to this critical area of study, highlighting its potential to enhance mental health outcomes and reduce the societal burden of early-life adversity.

Conte Center grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. Conte Center grants are bestowed on the most promising multidisciplinary and often cross-species approaches to improving the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues.

https://news-medical.net,IL-12 targeting could open pathways for new Alzheimer's treatments,https://news-medical.net/news/20250317/IL-12-targeting-could-open-pathways-for-new-Alzheimers-treatments.aspx,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Researchers from Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the Max Delbrück Center have detailed the precise mechanism through which the inflammatory signaling molecule IL-12 contributes to Alzheimer's disease. The study was published in in the journal ""Nature Aging.""

Microglia, the brain's immune cells, usually serve as diligent guardians. They eliminate intruders such as microbes and clear away cellular debris – including the plaques typical of Alzheimer's disease. However, as our brains age, microglia also change. While some continue to function effectively, others gradually lose their protective role and start secreting small amounts of inflammatory messengers.

One such messenger is interleukin-12 (IL-12). Through meticulous analyses, research teams led by Professor Frank Heppner, Director of the Department of Neuropathology at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, and Professor Nikolaus Rajewsky, Director of the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology at the Max Delbrück Center (MDC-BIMSB), along with additional partners, have identified how IL-12 might trigger and accelerate Alzheimer's dementia. Their study, published in ""Nature Aging,"" could pave the way for new combination therapies.

For decades, Alzheimer's research focused almost exclusively on amyloid-beta and tau deposits, while inflammation was considered a side effect. Only recently have we begun to recognize that inflammatory processes may be a primary driver of disease progression."" Professor Frank Heppner, Director of the Department of Neuropathology at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin

In 2012, Heppner's lab reported in Nature Medicine that blocking IL-12 and IL-23 significantly reduced Alzheimer's-related brain changes in mice. ""But we couldn't unravel the underlying mechanism with standard techniques,"" Heppner explains. He reasoned that single cell analyses might provide more decisive clues, so he asked Rajewsky to collaborate.

Sticky and tangled brain cells

Throughout life, cells refer to their genetic instructions to respond to external stimuli. Researchers use single-cell analyses to observe this process, reconstructing which genes are being read and translated into proteins in thousands of individual cells simultaneously. These analyses generate massive datasets, which can now be analyzed with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning. However, a major challenge in using single cell sequencing technology is isolating individual cells from a tissue sample without damaging them or causing unintended changes. ""In aging mouse brains – especially those with Alzheimer's plaques – cells are so stuck together and tangled that separating them cleanly is nearly impossible,"" Rajewsky explains.

His team spent several years perfecting a workaround. Instead of isolating entire cells, they extract cell nuclei from brain tissue and analyze the RNA present in each cell. By cross-referencing with publicly available data, such as the Allen Brain Atlas, they can ensure that their method provides a representative snapshot of all cell populations. For the present study, they sequenced RNA from over 80,000 cell nuclei and developed specialized workflows to process the data. They also reconstructed communication between cells. ""Our teams repeatedly sat together to try to interpret this highly complex data,"" Rajewsky says. ""This painstaking early optimization was crucial – without it, we would not have been able to detect these connections.""

How IL-12 damages the Alzheimer's brain

IL-12, previously known primarily for its role in autoimmune diseases like Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, appears to play a pivotal role in Alzheimer's progression. It damages two key brain cell types: mature oligodendrocytes, which normally produce myelin ­– the fatty insulating layer around nerve fibers essential for rapid signal transmission; and interneurons, which are particularly important for cognition and memory. IL-12 binding to interneurons causes them to die. A vicious circle begins: As more microglia produce IL-12, more brain cells sustain damage. Meanwhile, remaining functional microglia become overburdened by the task of clearing the additional cellular debris, and thus fail to remove Alzheimer's plaques.

To verify this mechanism, researchers tested it in mice and in human tissue. When Heppner's team blocked IL-12 in cell cultures and mouse models, they could stem disease-related changes. Electron micrographs of mouse brain tissue taken at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Göttingen also showed how myelin structure and nerve fiber density changed depending on whether the IL-12 signaling pathway was present or absent. Mass spectrometric analyses (lipidomics) at the University of Zurich confirmed the altered composition of the fat-rich insulating layer. Study of autopsy tissue from Alzheimer's patients provided further confirmation of the results – the more advanced the disease, the more IL-12 was present in the tissue. Cell cultures with human oligodendrocytes were also extremely sensitive to IL-12.

Potential combination therapy

""We now have a highly detailed picture of this mechanism, with single-cell technologies serving as a crucial catalyst. The only remaining question is which cell type IL-12 impacts first – oligodendrocytes, interneurons, or both simultaneously,"" says Heppner, who is also Group Leader in Neuroimmunology at the Deutschen Zentrums für Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen (DZNE).

The study has immediate implications as there are already drugs on the market that block IL-12. The researchers hope that clinicians will build on their findings and initiate clinical trials. ""If these drugs prove effective, they would be a new arrow in the quiver. Alzheimer's doesn't just have one cause. One axis of the disease is also controlled by the immune system, at least in some patients. Slowing neurodegeneration will require combination therapy,"" Heppner emphasizes. Such an approach could start early in the disease process, as IL-12 can be measured in blood or cerebrospinal fluid, he adds.

Meanwhile, the teams at Charité and the Max Delbrück Center are exploring a new hypothesis: Could microplastic in the brain drive microglia to produce IL-12? ""Microglia may struggle to process microplastic, triggering inflammatory reactions,"" Rajewsky suggests. ""This could reveal a link between environmental factors and widespread diseases."" While unproven, both teams consider it a compelling and important research direction.",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,Researchers move closer to a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B,https://news-medical.net/news/20250317/Researchers-move-closer-to-a-functional-cure-for-chronic-hepatitis-B.aspx,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Hepatitis B virus infection remains one of the leading causes of liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite widespread vaccination and antiviral treatments, millions of people still suffer from chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The primary challenge in curing the disease lies in the persistence of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), a stable viral DNA form that resides in the nucleus of infected liver cells. Current therapies, such as nucleos(t)ide analogues and interferons, fail to eliminate cccDNA, allowing the virus to rebound after treatment is stopped. These challenges underscore the need for novel therapeutic strategies that specifically target cccDNA to achieve a functional cure.



In a review (DOI: 10.1016/j.gendis.2024.101215) published in Genes & Diseases on February 3, 2024, a team of researchers from Chongqing Medical University, in collaboration with other institutions, delves into the epigenetic regulation of HBV cccDNA. The study examines the molecular mechanisms governing cccDNA activity and explores potential therapeutic approaches to silence its transcription. By focusing on chromatin-modifying enzymes, viral proteins, and noncoding RNAs, the researchers hope to uncover new pathways for a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B.



The review highlights the complex biology of cccDNA, which forms minichromosomes in the infected liver cell nucleus. These minichromosomes bind with histone and nonhistone proteins, becoming transcriptionally active and sustaining viral replication. Key epigenetic mechanisms—such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the involvement of noncoding RNAs—regulate cccDNA activity. For example, DNA methylation suppresses viral transcription, while histone modifications like acetylation and succinylation can either activate or silence cccDNA transcription, providing potential targets for intervention.



One of the most compelling findings is the role of the HBV protein HBx in maintaining cccDNA transcriptional activity. HBx interacts with host factors to alter the epigenetic landscape of cccDNA, promoting an open chromatin state that facilitates viral gene expression. The study also explores emerging therapeutic strategies, including targeting HBx, utilizing epigenetic modifiers, and employing gene-editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt cccDNA. These innovative approaches offer the potential to permanently silence cccDNA, paving the way for a functional cure.



Dr. Juan Chen, the corresponding author of the study, emphasized the importance of epigenetic regulation in controlling cccDNA.

Our findings underscore the critical role of epigenetic mechanisms in HBV pathogenesis. By targeting these pathways, we can develop therapies that not only suppress viral replication but also offer a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B."" Dr. Juan Chen, corresponding author of the study

The implications of this review are far-reaching for the future of HBV therapies. Epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, could be repurposed or newly designed to specifically target cccDNA. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 technology offers a precise method for disrupting cccDNA, potentially leading to a permanent cure. By combining these strategies with current antiviral treatments, researchers could significantly enhance their effectiveness, bringing us closer to a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B. This research not only advances our understanding of HBV biology but also sets the stage for the next generation of therapeutic innovations in the fight against viral hepatitis.",news-medical
https://news-medical.net,New research reveals potential path forward for glioblastoma treatment,https://news-medical.net/news/20250317/New-research-reveals-potential-path-forward-for-glioblastoma-treatment.aspx,"Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Glioblastoma has remained one of the toughest cancers to treat, resisting even the latest advances in immunotherapy. But new research from Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, suggests a way forward: suppressing a protein called ZNF638 triggers an antiviral immune response, making immune checkpoint inhibitors more effective. The discovery not only offers a potential new treatment strategy but also identifies ZNF638 as a biomarker that could help personalize immunotherapy for patients. The findings appear in the March 17 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation.

Glioblastoma is the most common type of brain tumor in adults, with about 12,000 cases in the United States each year. Despite the disease's prevalence, outcomes for patients with glioblastoma have barely improved in the last 20 years. With a strongly immunosuppressive microenvironment, highly variable presentations between patients, and physically challenging surgical conditions, glioblastoma remains exceptionally difficult to treat.

Brain tumors are one of the most formidable foes in medicine. Our current treatment options are simply insufficient."" Ashish H. Shah, M.D., senior author of the study, neurosurgeon and researcher at Sylvester

Immune checkpoint inhibition has been successfully used to treat more than a dozen diverse cancers, but because brain cancers are in such a strongly immune-suppressive environment, the treatment has largely failed in the case-by-case attempts to date. ""For many other cancers, immunotherapies have completely changed the field, but for brain tumors, we haven't seen that same improvement,"" Shah said. ""At least, not yet.""

Learning what could make immune checkpoint therapies more effective - or effective at all - for glioblastoma patients is critical for understanding how to treat patients best. According to Shah's new study, viral mimicry may be the answer.

Viral mimicry

Viral mimicry, a tool at the leading edge of cancer treatment, may be the key path forward in making immune checkpoint inhibition effective for treating glioblastoma.

The goal of viral mimicry is to trick the body into thinking the tumor has a viral infection, prompting an immune response. Over millions of years, the human genome has collected fragments of viruses called human endogenous retroviruses. Most of the time, our body silences these retroviral genes through various mechanisms, particularly the HUSH protein complex. In viral mimicry, clinicians trigger the patient's body to ""un-silence"" these inactive viral fragments. These ancient fragments are not strong enough to cause a real viral infection, but they still trigger an anti-viral immune response. That antiviral response can make tumors more susceptible to immunotherapies.

""We're using evolution to attack tumors,"" Shah said. Viral mimicry was first successfully used to make ovarian cancer more susceptible to ICI in 2015. It has since been used in at least four other cancers, and it's a rapidly developing area of research. But it had not been successfully applied to brain tumors until Shah's new work.

Un-silencing ancient viruses

The question for Shah and his team, then, was how they could use viral mimicry to make immune checkpoint inhibitors work for glioblastoma. For that, they turned to ZNF638, a key regulator of the group of proteins that keep retroviruses silent. By suppressing ZNF638 in the tumor, they might create a viral mimicry response, opening the doors to immune checkpoint inhibitors effectively treating glioblastoma at last.

The researchers first searched cancer databases, documenting associations between ZNF638 and immune-related factors such as immune cell infiltration. They analyzed glioblastoma patients' genetic data and found that patients who were more responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy naturally had lower expressions of ZNF638 and higher survival rates. Cell-based experiments and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that tumors with low ZNF638 tended to have more immune cell infiltration, and the monitoring system for retroviruses was active. This ZNF638-antiviral connection was seen in published patient data, too. It was possible that targeting ZNF638 could create ""viral mimicry"" conditions in tumors.

Armed with these results, the researchers tested the impacts of suppressing ZNF638 in preclinical tests, targeting it only in the tumor cells and leaving healthy brain tissue untouched. Combining ZNF638 targeting with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy improved the treatment's efficacy: ZNF638 suppression had decreased tumor growth, increased T-cell lymphocyte infiltration and improved survival times.

""The most surprising findings were in the clinical data, where patients with low ZNF638 expression had improved responses to immunotherapy,"" said Jay Chandar, a fourth-year medical student in Shah's lab and study co-author. ""That strongly supported our whole idea that knocking down ZNF638 would make tumors more susceptible to immunotherapy.""

""With previous trials using ICI to treat glioblastoma having largely failed, it's exciting to find a novel therapeutic target and see that viral mimicry could help,"" said Deepa Seetharam, Ph.D., a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Neurosurgery and study co-author. ""I'm optimistic this could improve prognoses for glioblastoma patients.""

The future of immunotherapy for glioblastoma

The promising results point to the potential for ZNF638 to be a biomarker, shaping personalized treatment plans. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are not currently approved for treating glioblastoma, so previous patients have been on a case-by-case basis, Shah said. Using ZNF638 as a biomarker could help change that by predicting which patients would likely be responsive to ICI therapy.

The research, led by Anne E. Hall in the lab of Dr. Justine Lee analyzed data from 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted between 2004 and 2024, involving a total of 2,376 patients. It is published in the Annals of Surgery

What is psychological prehabilitation? Prehabilitation is a proactive approach aimed at improving surgical outcomes through preventive measures. Traditionally, it has focused on physical function and patient education. However, mental health has recently gained attention due to its crucial role in postoperative recovery, including reducing persistent opioid use.

Study methods The researchers conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of RCTs retrieved from databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar. They included studies with more than 50 adult surgical patients and evaluated the effects of different preoperative psychotherapy-based interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), supportive psychotherapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), on postoperative outcomes.

Key findings The study found that psychological prehabilitation significantly reduces the length of hospital stay, pain, anxiety, and depression after surgery. Specifically, the analysis showed:

A reduction in length of hospital stay (LOS) by an average of 1.62 days;

A decrease in pain by an average of 3.52 points;

Lower anxiety levels regardless of which validated anxiety scale was used;

Reduced depression levels regardless of which validated depression scale was used.

Interestingly, the type of psychotherapy and the kind of surgery did not significantly affect the outcomes, except for anxiety.

Implications for healthcare The findings suggest that incorporating psychological prehabilitation into pre-surgery routines could lead to better overall recovery for patients. This approach may also help reduce healthcare costs associated with prolonged hospital stays and postoperative complications.

Future research The study highlights the need for further research to compare different types, durations, and delivery methods of psychotherapy to determine the most effective strategies for specific postoperative outcomes.",news-medical

Potential health benefits

Comparison with probiotics and prebiotics

Future of postbiotics

Postbiotics, defined as bioactive compounds produced by beneficial microbes such as lactic acid bacteria during the fermentation of prebiotic substrates, have recently gained significant attention in health sciences. Unlike probiotics, which contain live microorganisms, postbiotics include non-living microbial cells, cellular structures, and metabolites such as bacteriocins, exopolysaccharides, and peptidoglycan.1

Postbiotics' rising popularity stems from notable advantages over probiotics, including enhanced stability, safety, and longer shelf life. These advantages reduce the risks associated with live microbial consumption, such as potential pathogen transmission and antimicrobial resistance. Increasing research highlights postbiotics' beneficial mechanisms, primarily their ability to modulate protective actions against pathogens, fortify epithelial barriers, and regulate immune responses.

Due to these promising health effects, postbiotics are gaining traction across various sectors, especially in the food industry for bio-preservation and in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields for treating gastrointestinal disorders and enhancing immune functions.

This growing interest aligns with the demand for safe and effective functional foods addressing sub-health conditions, promoting general well-being, and managing gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea and bloating. As scientific understanding deepens, postbiotics stand poised to complement probiotics significantly, marking a transformative shift towards comprehensive, preventive healthcare strategies and innovative therapeutic applications.1

This article explores postbiotics, explaining what they are, how they differ from probiotics, and their potential benefits for gut health.

How postbiotics work

Unlike probiotics, postbiotics do not contain live cells but consist of metabolites, including bacteriocins, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and various organic acids. Their production involves controlled fermentation processes followed by techniques such as enzymatic hydrolysis, thermal treatment, and extraction, ensuring the isolation of the beneficial compounds while maintaining their biological efficacy.2,3

The primary mode of action of postbiotics involves modifying the gut environment, thereby enhancing the gut microbiota composition. They reduce intestinal pH, creating conditions that selectively favor beneficial microbes while suppressing pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Clostridium perfringens.

Specifically, SCFAs produced as postbiotic metabolites act as energy substrates for intestinal cells, facilitating the growth of beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. This results in improved intestinal barrier function, reduction in inflammation, and enhanced resistance to pathogenic colonization.2,3

In addition, postbiotics modulate the immune response by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines and downregulating pro-inflammatory signals. This balanced immune modulation reduces gut inflammation, enhancing overall gastrointestinal health and resilience.2

Research highlights postbiotics’ significant role in promoting growth performance, particularly in poultry. Dietary supplementation with postbiotics has been shown to improve nutrient absorption, optimize feed efficiency, and support better overall animal growth. For example, poultry-fed diets enriched with postbiotics demonstrate increased body weight gain, improved feed conversion rates, and healthier gut morphology compared to control groups.2,3

Moreover, postbiotics positively affect the quality of animal products. In poultry, the inclusion of postbiotics in diets leads to improvements in meat characteristics, including increased tenderness, reduced lipid peroxidation, enhanced color, and overall better sensory properties.2

Potential health benefits

Postbiotics contain bioactive substances, including SCFAs, exopolysaccharides, bacteriocins, and various proteins. These compounds exhibit diverse functional properties that are beneficial for gut and overall health.

For instance, SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, produced from microbial fermentation, are notable for their capacity to strengthen the gut barrier by enhancing the integrity of tight junction proteins, thus preventing pathogen invasion and systemic inflammation.4

The anti-inflammatory properties of postbiotics significantly contribute to their health benefits. Studies have shown that these metabolites can modulate inflammatory responses by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).

For example, specific proteins derived from Lactobacillus species, such as surface-layer proteins (SLPs), demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by reducing Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B (NF-κB) activation, a key pathway in inflammation.4

Postbiotics further support immune functions by influencing mucosal immunity. They promote the growth of beneficial gut microbiota, directly compete with pathogenic bacteria for adhesion sites, and enhance mucosal defense mechanisms through antimicrobial peptides. Research has shown that postbiotic administration increases beneficial microbes like Bifidobacteria while decreasing harmful pathogens such as Escherichia coli.4

Emerging evidence also suggests postbiotics can aid metabolic regulation, demonstrating potential anti-obesity and glucose homeostasis effects. Their stability, safety profile, and efficacy make them an attractive alternative or complement to probiotics, especially in immunocompromised individuals.

While extensive research continues to expand understanding of the mechanisms and specific health outcomes associated with postbiotics, current findings underscore their potential in clinical nutrition and therapy.4

Prebiotics and Probiotics: What’s the Difference?

Comparison with probiotics and prebiotics

Probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics are integral elements in gut microbiome management, each playing a unique yet interconnected role. Probiotics are live beneficial microorganisms, like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, directly impacting gut microbial composition and health. Prebiotics, such as inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), act as food for these beneficial bacteria, enhancing their proliferation and activity.5

Postbiotics, the latest addition to microbiome-focused interventions, represent non-living microbial cells or bioactive substances produced by probiotics during fermentation. Unlike probiotics, postbiotics are stable and less susceptible to environmental stressors such as heat or stomach acids, making them particularly advantageous in formulation and shelf stability.

They offer benefits like modulating immune responses, enhancing gut barrier integrity, and exerting anti-inflammatory effects without the risks associated with administering live microorganisms, especially in immunocompromised individuals.5

Several postbiotic products have entered the market, including heat-killed Lactobacillus plantarum preparations used to manage gastrointestinal discomfort and fermented formulas containing SCFAs to support gut health.5

However, postbiotic commercialization faces regulatory hurdles, primarily due to inconsistent definitions and the complex classification between dietary supplements and medicinal products. Regulatory bodies differ internationally, complicating standardized approvals.5

Integrating postbiotics into the broader microbiome conversation requires clearer regulatory frameworks and robust clinical evidence. Their continued development alongside probiotics and prebiotics promises to enrich microbiome management, offering safer and potentially more effective solutions for maintaining gut and overall health.5

Breaking down prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics Play

Future of postbiotics

Emerging research indicates postbiotics offer superior stability, safety, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional probiotics. Unlike probiotics, postbiotics withstand harsh gastrointestinal conditions, have extended shelf-life, and eliminate risks associated with live bacterial strains.5,6

Current market products include pasteurized Akkermansia muciniphila, utilized for obesity and insulin resistance management, and heat-inactivated Bifidobacterium bifidum (e.g., MIMBb75), effective against Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Additionally, bacterial lysate OM-85 (Broncho-Vaxom) is commercially available for respiratory immune support.6

Clinical trials and pre-clinical studies underline diverse medical applications. For instance, postbiotics like SCFAs, especially butyrate, demonstrate anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects beneficial in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disorders.

In food industries, postbiotic applications include functional food ingredients enhancing nutritional profiles and shelf-life stability.6

Despite promising advances, regulatory challenges persist. Clear guidelines distinguishing postbiotics from probiotics remain underdeveloped, complicating product standardization, labeling, and market authorization. Current regulations primarily address viable probiotics, necessitating updated frameworks explicitly tailored for postbiotic substances.6

Ongoing clinical studies continue to evaluate the efficacy, safety profiles, and mechanistic actions of various postbiotic compounds, promising deeper insights and validation of therapeutic claims. Addressing existing knowledge gaps through rigorous clinical research will be crucial for the successful integration and acceptance of postbiotics within mainstream medicine and the food industry.

Key takeaways

Chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer claim millions of lives each year — but what if the solution to reducing these risks was as simple as adding more fiber to your diet? Despite being one of the most powerful tools for disease prevention, fiber remains the most overlooked nutrient in modern diets.

This article examines the role of dietary fiber in lowering the risk of chronic diseases. It explores the current knowledge on the best sources of dietary fiber and how to incorporate more fiber into the daily diet.

What is dietary fiber?

Dietary fiber is a crucial component of a healthy diet, known for its role in promoting digestive health and preventing chronic diseases. Fiber is categorized into two main types: soluble fiber, which dissolves in water and forms a gel-like substance, and insoluble fiber, which adds bulk to stool and facilitates bowel movements.1

Both types contribute to overall health, influencing digestion, modulating gut bacteria and metabolism, and controlling systemic inflammation.

Despite the well-documented health benefits of dietary fiber, many individuals fail to meet the recommended daily intake. This deficiency has significant public health implications, as low fiber consumption is linked to increased risks of metabolic disorders, gastrointestinal diseases, kidney disease, cancer, and cardiovascular conditions.2–4

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which fiber exerts its protective effects is essential for developing dietary guidelines and intervention strategies to reduce the burden of chronic disease.

Additionally, cultural and socioeconomic factors also influence fiber consumption, highlighting the need for targeted dietary interventions and public health policies to bridge the gap in fiber intake across populations.

Why More Young Adults Are Getting Colorectal Cancer

Mechanisms of action

Fiber exerts its health benefits through multiple physiological mechanisms, such as gastrointestinal function, metabolic regulation, and modulation of inflammation. Fiber enhances bowel motility, prevents constipation, and supports gut microbiota diversity, which plays a role in immune regulation and metabolic health.5

The fermentation of dietary fiber by gut microbiota also produces metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which strengthen the gut barrier and reduce systemic inflammation.2,6

Additionally, fiber improves stool consistency and water retention, promoting regular bowel movements and reducing the risk of conditions such as diverticulosis and irritable bowel syndrome.1

Soluble fiber also regulates the metabolism by slowing gastric emptying, leading to improved glycemic control and lipid metabolism. This helps prevent insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.4,6

Moreover, fiber aids in weight management by promoting satiety and reducing overall caloric intake, further reducing the risk of obesity-related diseases. Dietary fiber also modulates gut hormone secretion, influencing appetite regulation and energy balance, which are critical for long-term metabolic health.2

The SCFAs, such as butyrate, produced during the fermentation of fibers also have anti-inflammatory effects and contribute to gut integrity. These fatty acids regulate immune function, modulating cytokine production and reducing markers of systemic inflammation.5

This process plays a crucial role in preventing chronic inflammatory conditions, including autoimmune diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and neurodegenerative disorders.

Fiber and disease prevention

Cardiovascular disease

Numerous meta-analyses have established that fiber intake is inversely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Higher dietary fiber consumption is linked to lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, improved blood pressure regulation, and reduced inflammation.2,3

One study also found that every 7 g/day increase in dietary fiber correlates with a 9% reduction in CVD risk.1 In addition, fiber reduces the risk of atherosclerosis by binding to bile acids, which facilitates their excretion and lowers cholesterol levels.2

Whole grains, in particular, contain high levels of beta-glucans, which have been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve endothelial function. High-fiber diets are also associated with improved arterial elasticity, which contributes to better circulation and reduced cardiovascular strain.7

Fiber intake has also been associated with lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a key marker of systemic inflammation that plays a role in cardiovascular disease progression.5

Type 2 diabetes

Dietary fiber also improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control by modulating digestion and glucose absorption. Epidemiological studies suggest that individuals with the highest fiber intake have a 20–30% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes.4,6 Cereal fibers, in particular, have shown significant protective effects.5

Additionally, soluble fiber slows carbohydrate absorption, reducing postprandial glucose spikes. This stabilizes blood sugar levels and lowers the demand for insulin, decreasing the likelihood of insulin resistance. Fiber also promotes a more diverse gut microbiota, which has been linked to improved metabolic health.8

High-fiber diets reduce systemic inflammation, a major factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

Furthermore, fiber enhances the production of gut-derived hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which plays a role in glucose metabolism and appetite regulation.4,5

Colorectal cancer

The consumption of dietary fiber, especially from whole grains, is strongly associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.

Fiber enhances stool bulk and reduces gut transit time, minimizing exposure of colonic cells to carcinogens. Additionally, the fermentation of fiber generates SCFAs, which support colonic health and exhibit anti-cancer properties.1,7

Studies suggest that fiber alters the gut microbiota composition in a way that reduces the production of harmful metabolites and enhances detoxification pathways. Certain types of fiber, such as resistant starch, have been shown to increase the production of butyrate, which has protective effects on colonic epithelial cells and may prevent tumor formation.2

Furthermore, fiber intake is associated with a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to cancer progression.1

Sources of fiber

Research suggests that optimal fiber intake is best achieved through whole foods rather than supplements. Key dietary sources include whole grains such as brown rice, oats, and whole wheat bread, as well as legumes like lentils, chickpeas, and black beans.

Fruits and vegetables, especially broccoli, carrots, and leafy greens, as well as nuts and seeds like chia seeds, flaxseeds, and almonds, are also excellent sources of dietary fiber.7

Current dietary guidelines recommend fiber intakes of 25 g per day for women and 38g per day for men, yet most individuals consume significantly less.2 However, increasing fiber intake requires dietary changes, such as replacing refined grains with whole grains, consuming more plant-based foods, and choosing fiber-rich snacks.

Additionally, dietary education programs can help individuals better understand fiber sources and implement gradual changes to improve long-term adherence.

Industrial processing and fiber loss

Unfortunately, modern food processing significantly reduces fiber content in many staple foods. Refining grains removes the bran and germ, stripping away essential fiber and nutrients.

Processed foods often lack the fermentable fibers necessary for gut health.8 Encouraging whole-food consumption over refined options is essential for maximizing fiber intake.

Fiber-rich foods also undergo chemical and thermal processing that can alter their structure, reducing their fermentability and bioavailability.

The widespread consumption of processed and ultra-processed foods contributes significantly to the global fiber deficit. Implementing policies that promote whole grain consumption and educate consumers about fiber-rich diets can help counteract these effects.

Furthermore, reformulating processed foods to include functional fiber additives, such as inulin and resistant starch, could be an additional strategy to improve fiber intake in modern diets.

Key takeaways

Dietary fiber is a key factor in preventing chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer. However, despite the clear health benefits, fiber intake remains insufficient in many populations.

Given its numerous health benefits, policymakers and healthcare professionals should advocate for fiber-rich diets as part of chronic disease prevention strategies.

Greater awareness and improved dietary habits can also significantly reduce the burden of preventable diseases and improve overall public health.

Moreover, future research should also focus on personalized nutrition strategies to optimize fiber intake based on individual health needs and genetic predispositions.
