Watch: President Trump tells reporters he will speak to Vladimir Putin

Edited by Johanna Chisholm

Civilians are continuing to be evacuated from the outskirts of Sudzha, a district in Russia's western Kursk region that was recently retaken by Moscow's armed forces.

According to the acting Kursk region governor, 371 people have been evacuated from ""liberated settlements"" - including 14 children - since 12 March.

As a reminder, Ukraine launched a military incursion in the Kursk region last August and captured some territory. 

However, Putin now claims Russia is fully back in control of Kursk, and Ukrainian troops are ""isolated"" - reports that Ukrainian officials have denied.

As we've been reporting, Ukrainian authorities have said Russian forces are continuing with their efforts to cross the border and invade Ukraine's northern Sumy region.

The Sumy region is across the border from Kursk, an area that Russian troops are currently retaking following Ukraine's mass incursion there in August last year.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had said that the Kursk operation had established a buffer zone which prevented Russian forces from being deployed in key areas of the front line in eastern Ukraine.

But Russia has steadily been taking territory back, and Ukrainian soldiers have been retreating.

Last week, Russian media reported that President Vladimir Putin visited the Kursk region for the first time since Ukraine's incursion.

We've recently been hearing from French President Emmanuel Macron, who says it's time to move toward a concrete peace plan ""with all our partners"".

""President Zelensky had the courage to accept the American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire. Now it's up to Russia to prove that it truly wants peace.

""Enough deaths.
Enough lives destroyed.
Enough destruction.

The guns must fall silent,"" Macron says in a post on X.

He adds that the ""abuses and sabotage must stop"" and that deported Ukrainian children must be reunited with their families - conditions he says  Russia must fulfil. 

Donald Trump is committed to the plan, Macron says, highlighting how this was something he talked to the US president about when the pair spoke yesterday.

Macron also stresses the need for ""solid security guarantees for Ukraine"" and a secure lasting peace in Ukraine and Europe. 

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

Responding to another question - this one about Trump's claims that Ukraine-Russia discussions have so far revolved around dividing ""assets"" - Leavitt says that Kyiv's government and President Zelensky have both been ""engaged"". 

She refuses to give more details, however, saying that it would be ""unwise"" to ""get ahead"" of Trump's call with Putin tomorrow.

Leavitt also criticises the Biden administration as ""the reason this war began"" - a common claim made by Trump and his administration.

Trump, she says, has ""made progress"" in the ceasefire negotiation. 

""Hopefully tomorrow that progress continues,"" she adds, before the press briefing ends.

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

Here in the White House briefing room, it's a particularly heavy news day, with questions about Ukraine and Russia few and far between so far. 

With regards to a potential ceasefire negotiation, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt again says that Trump and Putin will talk tomorrow. 

""We've never been closer to peace than at this moment,"" Leavitt says. ""The president is determined."" 

Much of this news briefing, however, has focused on US immigration issues and other domestic matters.

A bit earlier today, Russia's Ministry of Defence released a statement saying a village in the Zaporizhzhia region had been ""liberated"" by its military.

The Ukrainian military is now denying the claims that Moscow's troops captured Stepove, a village in
southeastern Zaporizhzhia region.

 “They're part of the information war, which seeks to boost
their fighting spirit,” says Vladyslav Voloshyn, a spokesman for the Ukrainian
Operational Command South. He has told Ukrainian Suspilne TV that the
Ukrainian army has not lost any ground in the area over the past two days.

Ruslan Mykula from Deep State, a Ukrainian volunteer project
tracking changes in the frontline, also says that Stepove is still under
Ukrainian control.

“The occupiers have made several attempts to enter and stay
in Stepove, but Ukrainian artillery is very active there,” he tells Suspilne.

More from the UK's Foreign Secretary David Lammy who has told
the House of Commons that he doesn't see any sign Vladimir Putin will agree to
the ceasefire proposals. 

But he says a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Canada last
week helped ""ready the tools to get Russia to negotiate seriously"".

""We're not waiting for the Kremlin. If they reject a
ceasefire, we have more cards we can play,"" he says before discussing
economic sanctions on Moscow, targeting energy and defence sectors, squeezing
oil revenues and freezing foreign Russian assets.

We can now bring you the latest comments from the UK's Foreign
Secretary David Lammy in the House of Commons. 

Lammy says Vladimir Putin now ""stands in the
spotlight"" and ""must answer"" after the US and Ukraine agreed to
a ceasefire deal last week.

""Are you serious, Mr Putin, about peace?” he asks the House,
“will you stop fighting or will you drag your feet?"" before demanding:
""If you are serious, prove it, with a full and unconditional ceasefire
now.""

Lammy says Ukraine is ""serious about peace"" before
accusing Russia of playing ""lip service to a ceasefire while still
pummelling Ukraine"".

Vitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC Monitoring

The BBC's US partner CBS News is reporting that the country is
withdrawing from the International Centre for
the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine, which
is investigating Russian leaders like Vladimir Putin over Moscow's invasion. 

Commenting on those reports, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov
said:

“The US is gradually cutting unnecessary functions; this means
that they think it's an unnecessary function.”

Former Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Alina Frolova, says
she does not expect ""so much success"" during tomorrow's talks between
US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

""My feeling is that Putin is still the master of
withdrawing, postponing,"" she says.

Frolova adds that the Ukrainian and European position on ongoing
peace negotiations is important. ""You can't make a deal without Ukraine
accepting it,"" she says.

""I don't think America can prevail absolutely in these
negotiations,"" Frolova says, adding that the US understands it needs
""Ukraine and Europe on board"".



Russia's Ministry of Defence has just released a statement on
its Telegram channel with an update on its military ""progress"" in
Ukraine.

It says the village of Stepove in the Zaporizhzhia region has
been ""liberated"" by units of the Dnepr military group.

It also says it has defeated Ukrainian forces in the settlements
of Tyaginka in the Kherson region and Pavlovka, also in the Zaporizhzhia
region.

The BBC cannot independently verify these claims.

The phone conversation between the Russian and US
presidents, which is expected to take place tomorrow, is “an important step
which sets the tone for reviving relations between the two countries,” Russia's official
news agency RIA Novosti has quoted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying.

There are no indications as to when they may meet in
person, he adds.

The chair of the foreign affairs committee in the Ukrainian
parliament, Oleksandr Merezhko, says the country has limits on how far it would
go to accept peace with Russia.

""We have three very firm red lines when it comes to
Ukraine,"" he tells the BBC, listing these as:



Merezkho goes on to say that he doesn't know what President Trump
expects from Russian leader Vladimir Putin, but adds ""Putin has proved many
times he's a pathological liar and manipulator"".

Trump and Putin are expected to hold talks tomorrow. Ukraine has
agreed to a 30-day ceasefire plan initiated by the US. Russia has said it
supports the idea but added that there are ""nuances"" to be worked
out.

Ahead of the talks between Presidents Putin and Trump, the
topics for discussion are being prepared, a Kremlin spokesperson says. 

Dmitry Peskov says the agenda includes the visit from US envoy
Steve Witkoff and various negotiations that have already happened, Russian news
agency Tass reports.

Peskov adds: ""Those issues that are on the agenda, but
mainly, of course, issues of Ukrainian regulation. These are the themes that
will be prepared for the president.""

The US president previously promised to end the Ukraine conflict within 24 hours of taking office

One week since the US and Ukraine announced their support for a 30-day ceasefire proposal, let's look at where the key players stand:

Trump: “A very good chance” the war could end

Although Russia is yet to agree to the ceasefire proposal, US
President Donald Trump insisted there is a “very good chance” the war
could end.

Addressing reporters, the US leader said he will speak with
Putin on Tuesday to discuss the peace proposals – as well as “land” and “power
plants” - and may have ""something to announce"".

Putin: “We support it but there are questions”

Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed support for the idea
of a ceasefire last week but set out several conditions for it to happen.

Those conditions include addressing “the root of this crisis,”
Putin said, mentioning the future of Russia's western Kursk region, as well as
details on who will enforce the ceasefire and how.

Zelensky: Putin is trying to “sabotage” peace

Responding to Putin's conditions for a ceasefire, Ukrainian
leader Volodymyr Zelensky accused Putin of trying to “sabotage” diplomatic
efforts by setting ""unacceptable conditions right from the start"".

In a post on social media, he also urged the US to put more
pressure on Russia and said only the ""strength of America"" could end
the war.

Lithuanian prosecutors have said Russia's military
intelligence agency, the GRU, is linked to arson attacks last spring
on shopping centres in
Vilnius and Warsaw. 

Two teenagers have been charged
with the attack in Lithuania, accused of planting an explosive device in an
Ikea store just before closing. 

In Warsaw, a huge shopping mall – Marywilska –
was burned to the ground.  

The news from Lithuanian
prosecutors has been used by
Poland's Prime Minister to remind others about what kind of Russia they
are dealing with ahead of any peace talks over Ukraine. 

As Donald Tusk points out, Russia hasn't only launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour, it is prosecuting a widespread hybrid war all over Europe. 

Writing on X he said: “Good to know [this] before negotiations.
Such is the nature of this state”.  

The two accused by Lithuania are Ukrainian nationals, fitting a pattern
for a series of sabotage and arson attacks across eastern Europe. 

Last month, a
Ukrainian citizen was found guilty of attempting to set fire to a paint factory
in Wroclaw, in western Poland – again, accused of working for Russian
intelligence. 

Poland closed the Russian consulate in Poznań in response to the
case.

More now from the news conference in Brussels with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. 

Asked how the EU will be involved in the ongoing negotiations on the war in Ukraine, Kallas says the bloc is ""discussing matters with different interlocutors"".

She describes the continuing peace talks as ""shuttle diplomacy"", saying ""there's no negotiation table"".

There's no negotiation table yet because Russia is not coming to the negotiation table.""

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas

We've just heard from Kaja Kallas, the European Union's foreign
policy chief, following a morning meeting of the bloc's Foreign Affairs
Council.

Speaking at a news conference, Kallas says the council had an
""intensive"" meeting that covered a wide range of topics, saying there
was ""broad political support"" for a defence initiative totalling  €40bn (£34bn).

On the peace talks between US and Ukrainian officials in Saudi
Arabia that led to a 30-day ceasefire proposal, she says everyone welcomed the
results of the talks and reiterates that the ""ball is in Russia's
court"".

""The understanding around the table is that Russia can't
really be trusted,"" she adds. ""They will seize this opportunity to
present all kinds of demands.""

Ukraine and Russia continued to exchange drone strikes
overnight, according to officials from both countries.

Ukrainian police said that a local resident was killed after a
drone targeted his car in the front-line town of Myrnohrad, in the eastern
Donetsk region.

And Ukraine's state-owned electricity operator Ukrenergo
reported that several regions across the country have been left without power
due to Russian drone attacks.

Below are the latest images coming through from Ukrainian
authorities.

Three children have been injured in Russian shelling of the
Ukrainian frontline town of Pokrovsk this morning, local authorities report.

Vadym Filashkin, the head of the Donetsk regional
administration, says in a Facebook post that
the children - two girls aged eight and 15, and a 12-year-old boy - had previously
been evacuated to a safer region of Ukraine, but their parents later “made the
crazy decision to return to Pokrovsk"".

“Grown-ups who make their children sit under shelling in
frontline towns are infuriating. If you don't care about yourselves, at least
take care of your children! Don't wait for shells or bombs to hit your home!
Evacuate!” Filashkin says.

Pokrovsk is a key logistics hub in
Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, which Russians have been trying to capture
for many months.

Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall vowed the government's upcoming welfare reforms will ensure ""fairness"", as she faced a series of questions in the House of Commons.

The proposal has already sparked some backlash within the Labour party,asthe BBC's Economics editor Faisal Islam says. 

Amongst the critics is Diane Abbott who has called for a wealth tax as an alternative to the cuts - we have more on her counter-proposal.

A Downing Street spokesman earlier said that the government has a moral ""duty to fix"" the welfare system.

Kendall reassured the Commons that ""proposals will soon become clear"".

And that's true, on Tuesday she'll be making an announcement on the welfare reforms - we'll be providing live updates and analysis of that right here, so be sure to join us.

For now, we're pausing our coverage. You can keep up to date with the latest in our news story. Thanks for joining us.

With the government set to outline its plans for welfare reform on Tuesday, Westminster watchers are keeping a close eye on how Labour is both managing and reacting to possible changes. 

Here's a look at some of the rhetoric we've heard today:

What has the government said?

Work and pensions secretary Liz Kendallhas vowed to ""get the welfare bill on a sustainable footing"", as she urged colleagues to be ""patient"" ahead of the reforms. She added that ""treating people with dignity and respect is at the heart of this government's plans"".

The prime minister's spokesperson denied the notion that reforms are being introduced because of the UK's fiscal backdrop, instead saying the government has ""a duty to fix the broken system that is letting millions of people in this country down"".

Backlash from some Labour MPs

Welfare reform proposals have sparked an internal backlash within the Labour Party, writes BBC's Faisal Islam. We've taken a look at what some of them have been saying:

Today, the BBC heard from veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott, who urged the government should introduce a 2% wealth tax on people with assets worth more than £10 million, rather than make welfare cuts. 

Labour MP for Clapham and Brixton Hill, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, warned that cutting support or reducing eligibility ""won't push more people into work, it will only push more people into poverty"".

Chris MasonPolitical editor

There are a trinity of trade-offs for the government as it prepares to shake up the benefits system.

How does it save money?

How does it increase the incentives for people to find a job?

And how does it protect those it has concluded are unquestionably reliant on the state, once it has defined who they are?

If ministers tack too far in any of these directions, they will probably undermine at least one of the other two, so you can see how fraught this is.

I am very aware at moments like this that we have an imperfect picture of what is to come.

It is incumbent on reporters to be responsible, and clear about what we don't know, so as not to cause unnecessary alarm.

There is a danger in under or over emphasising particular elements which may or may not happen or may, perhaps more likely, contain mitigations or nuances that we are not currently aware of.

Disability benefits are projected to see a sharp increase over the next five years, data from the Office for Budget Responsibility shows. 

Between 2024-2025, the benefit cost around £40bn but in 2029-2030 it is estimated to cost around £60bn.

Money spent on Universal Credit will remain much higher, while child benefits and ""other spending"" will remain steady.

By Gerry Georgieva 

When talking about the people
who are not in education, employment or training (NEETs), the shadow work and
pensions secretary Helen Whately said that ""since Labour have been in
office, there are 100,000 more young people in exactly that situation"".

This doesn't seem correct.

In April to June 2024, just
before Labour came into power, there were 908,000 young people who were NEET, external.

In the latest figures for
October to December 2024, there were 987,000 young people who were NEET. 

So the number has gone up by
79,000.

How could welfare benefits change?

There's been a lot of focus today on the amount of welfare spending for working-age adults. 

As we reported earlier, the prime minister's spokesperson raised the issue when defending the government's focus on reform. 

Asked by journalists if planned changes are coming as a result of the UK's fiscal backdrop, they said no.

Instead they pointed to, among other things, the UK having the ""highest level of working-age inactivity due to ill health in western Europe"". 

Welfare spending on working age adults - defined as those aged between 16 and 64 - was £48.5 billion in 2023-24. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) projects it is due to rise to £75.7 billion in 2029-30, as the graph below illustrates.

A think thank chief says tightening eligibility criteria for Personal Independence Payments (PIP) is ""unlikely to have a huge effect on work incentives"".

Ruth Curtice, Resolution Foundation's chief executive, tells BBC's Radio 4's World at One that the change is ""likely to concentrate all of the income losses on a small number of claimants"".

She warns this will have a ""really significant effect"" on those impacted. She adds that there is much about the benefits system, other than eligibility, which could be improved.

By Anthony Reuben

Earlier today the prime minister's
spokesman told journalists: “Three million people are out of work for
health reasons, and one in eight young people not currently in work, education
or training. So we've got a duty to fix the system.”

He is correct, according to the latest figures from theOffice for National Statistics (ONS), external, which show that of the 9.3 million people in the UK who were economically
inactive between October and December last year, three million were not working
because they were sick.

On the second part of the
claim, in the same period there were around 987,000 people aged 16 to 24
years in the UK who were not in education, employment or training, which wasaround 13.4% of the total, external – that's about one in eight.

 But both of these figures come from the Labour Force
Survey, which the ONS says should be treated with “caution” at the moment
because fewer people have been agreeing to participate in it.

Since coming to power Keir Starmer has made some controversial decisions - reducing winter fuel allowance, hiking national insurance for employers and slashing the Foreign Aid budget. 

But the looming cuts to welfare will be the toughest test yet of Labour MPs' loyalty. Many have only voiced their unease privately but that could change when they see the details of exactly how disability benefits will be cut. 

Remember, David Cameron's Conservative government had to back down over similar plans in 2016. The government says the welfare system needs reform to help more people to work, but ministers need to persuade Labour MPs that this isn't just a cost cutting exercise.

MPs have just finished quizzing ministers at the regular work and pensions session in the House of Commons. 

The government's plans to bring forward welfare reforms came up several times. Here's what we heard:

Green Party MP Sian Berry says the government's ""active trailing of welfare cuts has generated genuine fear"". 

She asks if Kendall will apologise for this and reassure the public that benefit changes will not take place this year. 

Labour MP Stephen Timms, responds, saying he recognises that there has been a ""good deal of anxiety"".

""I regret that that has occurred,"" he says, adding that the proposals will soon become clear and that he thinks Berry will welcome them. 

In our next post, we'll bring you a recap of the key lines, following questions on benefits reform in the House of Commons.

The shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately is back with another question, she asks if Kendall has a ""collective agreement"" on the plans she is due to announce on Tuesday.

""Given all the media briefings, the apprehension of disabled people and the growing number of people not working, none of us would want to see that delayed,"" Whately states. She claims that Kendall still doesn't have the support of her cabinet with less than 24 hours to go.

Kendall says Whately will have to ""show a little patience"".

In response to Whately, she adds: ""She talks about plans - we've seen her and the shadow chancellor writing in various newspapers claiming about their plan, but there never was a plan.""

Questions to Liz Kendall in the House of Commons have just concluded, stay with us as we continue to bring you the latest updates and analysis.

Former Conservative Cabinet minister Sir Jeremy Wright asks about reforming the Personal Independence Payments (PIP) reassessment process.

He suggests that for those whose conditions are not going to improve ""it would be sensible to relieve them of the burden"" of that process.

This would lead to ""less distress for them, saving money in the system and allowing people who do need reassessment to be reassessed faster"", he adds.

Kendall says she agrees with a lot of what he says. 

She asks the House to be patient and look at the full proposals the government ""will be putting forward imminently"".

Questions have now turned away from McGovern and back to Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall.

Labour MP David Williams, referencing his constituent who was ""badly let down by a flawed PIP assessment"", asks what steps will be taken to ensure people are treated with fairness and dignity, and given the support they need. 

Kendall says treating people with dignity and respect is at ""the heart of the government's plans"".

She adds that she regularly meets disabled people who are denied the chance of work.

""That is what we want to put right, to make sure that the social security system is there for those who need it - not just now, but for years to come,"" she adds. 

Labour MP Neil Duncan-Jordan, asks if McGovern will acknowledge that disabled people need more investment to help them, rather than freezes and cuts.

""I do agree,"" replies Alison McGovern. 

The work and pensions minister adds: ""We see potential in every single person in this country and many of those, who have been written off and left on the scrap heap, deserve a much better pathway back into work.""

Conservative MP Lincoln Jopp says people in his Spelthorne constituency don't mind paying taxes for a  safety net for the most vulnerable, but claims they ""really do get annoyed when they see their taxes going to people who are scamming the benefit system"". 

He asks ministers about ""so-called sickfluencer sites"" - where he says people are shown how to ""play the benefit system"". 

Alison McGovern, work and pensions minister, says the government's fraud bill is currently passing through Parliament and the issue he has raised is ""at the forefront"" of the relevant minister's attention.

They will take ""every step"" possible to deal with issues in that area, she says.

Liberal Democrat MP Liz Jarvis asks Labour's Stephen Timms if he can assure those who are unable to work that they won't see their benefits cut.

Timms says he is concerned about the level of anxiety and speculation in recent weeks.

He says that he recognises the concerns, without directly answering the question. 

He adds that the current welfare system is failing, and the government is aiming to make the system sustainable so it is around in the future.

Shadow work and pensions secretary Helen Whately asks Kendall why 100,000 more young people are ""not in education, employment or training, since the Labour government came into power"".

Kendall responds by hitting back at the ""legacy of 14 years of a Conservative government"".

""She had 14 years to solve that situation, and their record is clear - nearly one million young people not in education, employment or training - one in eight of all of our young people.""

She adds that the Conservative legacy is one her government is ""determined"" to change.

Liberal Democrat MP Max Wilkinson cites a report which he says finds that young people with disabilities face particular difficulty when trying to access work. 

He says when ministers make decisions to welfare changes, the report will be properly considered. 

""Absolutely,' Kendall says, adding that he will soon hear more about the government's plans, which will include ""proper employment support"".

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22world%20news%22%20site%3Art.com","Moscow accuses London of ‘piracy'","https://www.rt.com/news/614357-russia-uk-piracy-assets/","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:03:00 GMT","

Russia has accused the United Kingdom of engaging in modern-day piracy following former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's call to seize the Russian assets that were frozen in the West as part of Ukraine-related sanctions. 

In a social media post on Sunday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova likened Sunak's position to historical acts of piracy. 

“This is one of the English traditions, like tea drinking and horse racing. The fact is that piracy was legalized in England. Pirates were forbidden to attack English ships but were allowed to plunder rival vessels,” Zakharova wrote on Telegram. 

Zakharova's criticism follows Sunak's post on X, where he claimed that “Now is the time to seize [the Russian assets] and make Russia pay.” 

The former British prime minister was referring to the roughly $300 billion in assets belonging to Russia's central bank that had been immobilized by the Western financial system as part of Ukraine-related sanctions since 2022. The assets are mostly EU, US, and British government bonds held in a Brussels-based securities depository. 

“If we don't act, [the assets] could be handed back to Moscow to fund Putin's next war,” Sunak wrote on Sunday. 

The UK has consistently supported the seizure of frozen Russian assets. Last month, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that Europe should move from freezing Russian assets to actively seizing them.

Earlier this month, the British government agreed to issue a $2.84 billion loan to Ukraine backed by the income generated by the assets. In response, Moscow accused London of violating international law and warned that it will have to give the money back. 

The EU's economic sanctions against Russia come up for renewal every six months with the next extension due in July. 

The US launched negotiations last month to broker peace in Ukraine, with President Donald Trump indicating that sanctions against Moscow could be lifted if a settlement is achieved. Additionally, Hungary has repeatedly threatened to veto the renewal of EU sanctions against Russia. This means that the assets could potentially be released and returned to Moscow. 

The European Parliament last week called on EU member states, in collaboration with G7 partners, to “immediately seize all frozen Russian assets” in order to continue financing Kiev.

Moscow has repeatedly decried the asset freeze as “theft,” while the Kremlin has warned of consequences if Western countries go ahead with the proposed confiscation.

Human intellectual abilities such as reasoning and problem-solving are diminishing, possibly due to increased exposure to visual media, the Financial Times (FT) has reported.

Human intelligence appeared to peak in the early 2010s and has been in decline since, the FT added, citing PISA, an international benchmarking test for 15-year-olds that includes reading, mathematics and science, and adult cognitive evaluations.

The reported trend comes amid a rise in artificial intelligence (AI) which, by some estimates, may surpass human IQ in a matter of years.

The recorded spike in the share of high school students who reported difficulties in PISA tests coincides with a broad change in people's relationship with information, such as the transition away from reading and towards visual content, the publication explained.

While active, intentional use of digital technologies can often be beneficial, being passively exposed to infinite content on social media coupled with frequent context-switching has been shown to negatively impact attention span, memory, and self-regulation. The documented decline in reading among Americans reportedly comes alongside a decrease in numeracy and other forms of problem-solving in most countries.

Human intellectual capabilities, such as critical thinking, have also been impacted by generative AI, according to recent research by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University. Outsourcing thoughts to AI leaves people's minds “atrophied and unprepared,” which can lead to “the deterioration of cognitive faculties that ought to be preserved.”

Companies and governments have poured billions into AI research, focusing on areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, and automation. Tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI have introduced increasingly sophisticated models, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, capable of performing complex cognitive tasks.

AI could become smarter than humans in the next three years, tech billionaire Elon Musk warned in December, shortly after his AI company, xAI, launched its first image generation model, Aurora.

The Yemen-based Houthi movement said it has targeted a US navy carrier group with two long-range strikes over the past 24-hours, calling the attacks a retaliation for the deadly bombing campaign mounted by Washington over the weekend.

The group said on Sunday that it had launched some 18 ballistic missiles and drones at the “aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman and its accompanying warships.”

The attack was followed closely by another long-range strike, the group said on Monday. The Houthis did not claim to have hit the warships while the Pentagon made no public comments on alleged attack either.

US President Donald Trump ordered a “powerful military action” against the militants on Saturday, over what he described as an “unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism.”

The Houthi group, officially known as the Ansar Allah movement, has been in control of a large and the most-populous part of war-torn Yemen, including the capital city of Sanaa, since the mid-2010s, effectively acting as the country's de-facto authorities.

The strikes on Saturday killed at least 53 people and left nearly 100 injured, according to the country's Houthi-run health ministry. Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz claimed the strikes “hit multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.”

Additional strikes were reported by local Houthi-affiliated media on Sunday night. The targets reportedly included a cotton ginning plant located in the western coastal region of Hodeidah and an Israeli ro-ro ship seized by the Houthis over a year ago.

The group has launched numerous strikes on international shipping they believe to be linked to Israel since late 2023, in a campaign staged in solidarity with the Palestinians. The Houthis have also repeatedly conducted long-range ballistic missile and drone strikes on Israel, as well as on Western military vessels deployed into the region.

The US, UK, and Israel have repeatedly bombed alleged Houthi military sites in retaliation, yet the strikes have largely failed to stop the attacks on naval traffic.

The Houthis put their campaign on hold early this year after Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas reached a truce in Gaza. The group announced the resumption of their attacks last week after Israel failed to meet their deadline for unblocking the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame has highlighted Belgium's role in dividing the region during colonial rule, which led to families being separated across borders.

Speaking at the Presidential Citizen Outreach event at BK Arena in Kigali on Sunday, he said, “one of the misfortunes we have is having been colonized by a small country, similar in size to Rwanda, which partitioned Rwanda to match its own size.”

“They [Belgium] killed Rwandans 30 years ago and have continued to return to finish off the survivors. We warned them before, and we are doing so again,” he added.

The president claimed that Western nations are enforcing sanctions on Kigali under Belgium's influence. Kagame reiterated that Rwanda is not responsible for starting the war it is being accused of, but stressed that the country would resist the underlying agendas driving the conflict.

“If Rwanda is to be blamed for problems created by countries unwilling to care for their people, we have no choice but to fight. When resources are limited, we rely on relentless will and courage to defend ourselves,” Kagame said.

He called on the people of Rwanda to be resilient in the face of external challenges, reinforce national unity, and uphold peaceful relations with other nations grounded in mutual respect.

The remarks come amid escalating tensions between Rwanda and Belgium over the conflict in eastern DRC in February. Belgium has aligned with Kinshasa, accusing Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebels, who have seized major cities in the region. Kigali has denied accusations of supporting the rebels. In response, Rwanda suspended its 2024-29 bilateral aid program with Belgium, accusing it of interfering with regional peace efforts and politicizing development finance. 

Rwanda's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claims that Belgium has led an “aggressive campaign” with the DRC to sabotage Rwanda's development funding, describing the move as external interference which undermines African-led mediation processes to resolve the crisis in eastern DRC. The ministry stressed that development partnerships must be based on mutual respect and that Rwanda will not be bullied or blackmailed into compromising national security.

Belgium's deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, Maxime Prevot, acknowledged Rwanda's decision to suspend the aid program and stated that Belgium is already reviewing its cooperation with Rwanda due to concerns over Rwanda's alleged violation of the DRC's territorial integrity. 

The suspension affects around €95 million ($104 million) in development aid, which targeted healthcare systems and public financial management through 2029.

The EU must cut its reliance on US-made weapons and prioritize European alternatives, French President Emmanuel Macron has said. In an interview with French media published on Saturday, Macron argued that the bloc's rearmament efforts would be more effective if member states stopped “buying American” and instead turned to the EU's military industrial complex.

His comments followed European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's recent proposal to mobilize up to €800 billion ($875 billion) in debt and tax breaks for the bloc's military industrial complex.

Brussels insists the 'ReArm' militarization plan is aimed at countering an alleged “threat” from Russia, an idea Moscow has dismissed as baseless.

In the interview, Macron revealed that he recently met with French defense industry leaders to encourage them to position themselves as alternatives to US suppliers.

“I suggested to manufacturers that they could, on systems where we have the best products, approach European states that have gotten used to buying American,” Macron said.

“Those who buy Patriots, we must offer them the new generation Franco-Italian SAMP/T. Those who buy the F-35s, we must offer them the Rafale,” he added, referring to US missile defense systems and fighter jets and their European analogues.

To make European alternatives more appealing, Macron acknowledged that defense companies need to lower costs, simplify processes, and optimize production. He also linked the issue to growing economic tensions with Washington, citing US President Donald Trump's recent threats to impose tariffs on EU goods.

“Faced with unpredictable powers, we simply need to be less dependent on them. This means accelerating our sovereignty policy, notably by developing our own production and strategic culture, to be more independent in matters of defense and technology,” he stated.

Macron said he plans to discuss his proposals with incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the coming days.

A report last week by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) found that [Western] Europe's arms imports have more than doubled in the past five years compared to the previous five-year period. Two-thirds have come from the US, up from just over half in the previous period. SIPRI researcher Pieter Wezeman noted that while Europe has taken steps to boost its defense industry, reliance on American arms remains deeply rooted.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) will send a delegation to Angola for peace talks with rebels, Reuters reported on Sunday, citing the presidency. M23 fighters have increased their attacks on the Central African country's forces and allies in the east since the beginning of the year, escalating a decades-old conflict.

Angola announced last week that it will begin mediating direct ceasefire negotiations between the militants and DR Congo officials on March 18.

“At this stage, we can't say who will make up the delegation,” Tina Salama, spokesperson at the DR Congo presidency said, according to Reuters.

In a statement on X on Sunday, M23 spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka also said the group had received an invitation from the Angolan government, without stating whether they would attend the talks in Luanda. Last Wednesday, Bertrand Bisimwa, an M23 leader, described dialogue as “the only civilized option to resolve the current crisis that has lasted for decades.”

On Saturday, Angolan President Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco, who is also the chairman of the African Union, urged the conflicting parties to halt the hostilities from Sunday midnight to create a favorable climate for the talks. However, local officials reportedly claim clashes occurred in the North Kivu town of Walikale.

The Congolese authorities had previously refused to hold talks with the rebels, and Angola-mediated peace efforts were halted last December after Rwanda demanded that Kinshasa engage directly with the M23. Earlier this month, Congolese Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka reportedly said her government would only negotiate with Rwanda, which is the “aggressor of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Democratic Republic of Congo.” 

The former Belgian colony's mineral-rich eastern region has endured decades of violence, driven by the M23 and other armed groups fighting the authorities for power and minerals such as gold and diamonds. The Congolese government has repeatedly accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the militants – which the neighboring state denies.

In the latest escalation, which erupted in January, the militants have seized several key cities, including the North Kivu capital, Goma, and Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu. According to recent figures from Kinshasa's Health Ministry, over 8,500 people have died as a result of the fighting.

The Southern African regional bloc (SADC), which had troops in the DR Congo helping the Congolese Army fight the armed groups, announced a “phased withdrawal” of the contingent last week. The grouping has lost more than a dozen peacekeepers, including Malawian, Tanzanian, and South African soldiers, in the ongoing fighting.

Ivan Hansen, a retired Danish police officer, loaded up his basket at the supermarket, carefully checking each product to avoid buying anything made in the United States. No more Coca-Cola, no more California Zinfandel wine or almonds.



The 67-year-old said it's the only way he knows to protest U.S. President Donald Trump's policies. He's furious about Trump's threat to seize the Danish territory of Greenland, but it's not just that. There are also the threats to take control of the Panama Canal and Gaza. And Trump's relationship with Elon Musk, who has far-right ties and made what many interpreted as a straight-armed Nazi salute. 



On his recent shopping trip, Hansen returned home with dates from Iran. It shocked him to realize that he now perceives the United States as a greater threat than Iran.



“Trump really looks like a bully who tries in every way to intimidate, threaten others to get his way,” he told The Associated Press. “I will fight against that kind of thing.”

And don't worry, we still have plenty of labels from the rest of the world.'', Monday, March 17, 2025. (Bo Amstrup/Ritzau Scanpix via AP)













Hansen is just one supporter of a growing movement across Europe and Canada to boycott U.S. products. People are joining Facebook groups where they exchange ideas about how to avoid U.S. products and find alternatives. Feelings are especially strong across the Nordic region — and very possibly strongest in Denmark given Trump's threats to seize Greenland. 



Google trends showed a spike in searches for the term “Boycott USA,” and “Boycott America,” as Trump announced new tariffs, with the top regions including Denmark, Canada and France. At the same time, a global backslash is also building against Tesla as the brand becomes tied to Trump, with plunging sales in Europe and Canada. In Germany, police were investigating after four Teslas were set on fire Friday.










Elsebeth Pedersen, who lives in Faaborg on the Danish island of Funen, just bought a car and made a point of not even looking at U.S.-made options. 



“Before Elon Musk started to act like a maniac a Tesla could have been an option. And maybe a Ford,” she said. 



French entrepreneur Romain Roy said his solar panel firm has bought a new Tesla fleet each year since 2021 but canceled its order for another 15 to take a stand against Musk's and Trump's policies. 



Describing the United States as “a country closing in on itself,” he cited Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and Musk's arm gestures. He said he was instead buying European models, even though it would cost an additional 150,000 euros ($164,000).



“Individual consumers, society, our countries, Europe must react,” he told broadcaster Sud Radio.



Responding to consumer demand, Denmark's largest supermarket chain, the Salling Group, created a star-shaped label this month to mark European-made goods sold in its stores. CEO Anders Hagh said it's not a boycott, but a response to consumers demanding a way to easily avoid American products.



“Our stores will continue to have brands on the shelves from all over the world, and it will always be up to customers to choose. The new label is only an additional service for customers who want to buy goods with European labels,” he said in a LinkedIn post.

For Bo Albertus, “when Trump went on television and said he would by political force or military force take a piece of the Danish kingdom, it was just too much for me.” 



The 57-year-old said he felt powerless and had to do something. He has given up Pepsi, Colgate toothpaste, Heinz ketchup and California wine, and replaced them with European products.



He is now an administrator of the Danish Facebook page “Boykot varer fra USA” (Boycott goods from the U.S.), which has swelled to over 80,000 members.



“Drink more champagne,” one user posted after Trump threatened 200% tariffs on EU wine and Champagne. 



Albertus, a school principal, told the AP he really misses the strong taste of Colgate. But he's been pleasantly surprised at finding a cola replacement that is half the price of Pepsi. 



Trump's policies have “brought the Danish Viking blood boiling,” said Jens Olsen, an electrician and carpenter. He is now considering replacing $10,000 worth of U.S.-made DeWalt power tools even though it will cost him a lot.



He has already found European replacements for an American popcorn brand and California-made Lagunitas IPA beer, which he calls “the best in the world.” 



“I've visited the brewery several times, but now I don't buy it anymore,” he said. He has mixed feelings because he is a dual Danish-U.S. citizen, and has spent a lot of time in the United States. But he can't contain his anger.



“I'm 66 years old and I have never seen the Danes so upset before,” he said. 



Michael Ramgil Stæhr has canceled a fall trip to the U.S. and is among many choosing to buy Danish instead of American-made, though he cannot pinpoint the exact moment he made the decision.



“Maybe it was when (Trump) announced to the world press that he intended to ‘take' Greenland and the Panama Canal, and if necessary by military force. That and the gangster-like behavior towards the Ukrainian president in the White House,” the 53-year-old Copenhagen resident said.



“The man is deadly dangerous and is already costing lives” in the developing world and Ukraine, added Stæhr, who works helping disabled war veterans, many of whom got injured serving alongside U.S. troops in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan. He himself served in Bosnia.











Edouard Roussez, a farmer from northern France, launched an online group, “Boycott USA, Buy French and European!” that in just two weeks has attracted over 20,000 members on Facebook.



Roussez believes a boycott of U.S. companies is a good way to express opposition to Trump's policies, especially “the commercial and ideological war” he believes Trump is waging against Europe. 



“First of all, these are the companies that financed Donald Trump's campaign,” he said on state-owned LCP television channel. “I'm thinking of Airbnb, I'm thinking of Uber, I'm thinking of Tesla of course.” 



The irony of it all? The group is on Facebook. Roussez said only the American online social media platform gave him the reach he needed. But he's working to migrate the group to other platforms with no U.S. funding or capital.

As for any impact on U.S. export profits or policymaking, that's unlikely, said Olof Johansson Stenman, a professor of economics at the University of Gothenburg.



The boycott could have a psychological effect on Americans who see the scale of anger, but “some may also say, ‘We don't like these Europeans anyway,'” Stenman said.







Simon Madsen, 54, who lives in the Danish city of Horsens with his wife and 13-year-old twins, says the family has given up Pringles, Oreos and Pepsi Max. Not so hard, really. 



But now they're discussing doing without Netflix, and that is a step too far for the kids.



He also wonders whether he should keep buying Danish-made Anthon Berg chocolate marzipan bars, which are made with American almonds.



It's important, he said, for people to use the power of the purse to pressure companies to change. 



“It's the only weapon we've got,” he said.

The United States under President Donald Trump has launched a new campaign of intense airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels -- and this is how they fit into the wider tensions in the Middle East.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday explicitly linked the actions of Yemen's Houthi rebels to the group's main benefactor, Iran, warning Tehran would “suffer the consequences” for further attacks by the group. 

The comments by Trump on his Truth Social website escalate his administration's new campaign of airstrikes targeting the rebels, which killed at least 53 people this weekend alone and appear poised to continue. Meanwhile, Iran continues to weigh how to respond to a letter Trump sent them last week trying to jump-start negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. 

Houthi supporters themselves rallied in several cities Monday after the strikes, vowing revenge against America and Israel over blocking aid to the Gaza Strip after its war on Hamas there. The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel put young boys on air live, who chanted the group's slogan: “God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.”

“The Yemeni position is an irreversible position (regarding Gaza), so do whatever you (Americans) want, for we are men who fear no one but God,” said Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a Houthi leader who spoke to the demonstration in Yemen's rebel-held capital, Sanaa. 

The United Nations called for a halt to all military activities in Yemen and the Red Sea, urging “utmost restraint” and warning that “any additional escalation could exacerbate regional tensions,” U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Monday.




Describing the Houthis as “sinister mobsters and thugs,” Trump warned any attack by the group would be met with “great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there.” 

“Iran has played ‘the innocent victim' of rogue terrorists from which they've lost control, but they haven't lost control,” Trump alleged in his post. “They're dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, ‘Intelligence.'”

It's unclear what sparked Trump's post. However, the head of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard sought to separate the Houthis' actions from those of Tehran this weekend. The Houthis also launched drones and missiles targeting the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, though none reached the ship as it continues flight operations in the region. 

Iran did not immediately comment on the post. 

“Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!” Trump added. 

The Houthi rebels attacked over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, from November 2023 until January this year when a ceasefire began in Gaza. The campaign also greatly raised the Houthis' profile in the wider Arab world and tamped down on public criticism against their human rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent and aid workers.




The Houthis claimed there had been additional U.S. airstrikes overnight, though American officials did not immediately acknowledge them. 

In Saada province, the Houthis' stronghold, the rebels raided a warehouse run by the World Food Program. A member of Yemen's exiled government first reported the Houthis had been taking supplies from the facility without the WFP's permission in the aftermath of the U.S. airstrikes. The United Nations agency later acknowledged the Houthis' actions to The Associated Press. 

“WFP regrets the de facto authorities' decision to seize some of the commodities,” it said. “These commodities were intended for the most vulnerable food-insecure families. Only WFP and its partners have the authority to distribute them and ensure they reach the intended recipients.”

Yemen, at war since the Houthis seized Sanaa back in 2014, has been on the precipice of famine for years. But the U.N. in February suspended its operations in Saada over security concerns following the detentions of dozens of U.N. workers and others in recent months. A day later, the WFP announced one of its staffers died while imprisoned by the Houthis. 

Associated Press writer Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations contributed to this report.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary's ruling coalition continued its crackdown on the country's LBGTQ+ community on Monday, as members submitted a bill to parliament that would ban the popular Budapest Pride event and allow authorities to use facial recognition software to identify attendees.

The bill is almost certain to pass, as the ruling coalition has a two-thirds majority in parliament.

The bill would make it an offense to hold or attend events that violate Hungary's contentious “child protection” legislation, which prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to minors under 18.

Attending a prohibited event would carry fines up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546), which the state would forward to “child protection.”

The proposal is the latest step against LGBTQ+ people taken by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose government has passed legislation that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive against sexual minorities.

The government portrays itself as a champion of traditional family values and a defender of Christian civilization from what it calls “gender madness,” and argues its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda.”

Hungary's “child protection” law was passed in 2021. Aside from banning the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality in content available to minors — including in television, films, advertisements and literature — it also prohibits the mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programs, and forbids the public depiction of “gender deviating from sex at birth.”




In a speech in February, Orbán hinted that his government would take steps to ban the Budapest Pride event, which attracts thousands and celebrates the history of the LGBTQ+ movement while asserting the equal rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.

Budapest Pride is marking its 30th anniversary.

The United States under President Donald Trump has launched a new campaign of intense airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels -- and this is how they fit into the wider tensions in the Middle East.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The United States under President Donald Trump has launched a new campaign of intense airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels. 

This weekend's strikes killed at least 53 people, including children, and wounded others. The campaign is likely to continue, part of a wider pressure campaign by Trump now targeting the Houthis' main benefactor, Iran, as well. 

Here's what to know about the U.S. strikes and what could happen next:

The Houthi rebels attacked over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, from November 2023 until January this year. Their leadership described the attacks as aiming to end the Israeli war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The campaign also greatly raised the Houthis' profile in the wider Arab world and tamped down on public criticism against their human rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent and aid workers.

Trump, writing on his social media platform Truth Social, said his administration targeted the Houthis over their “unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence and terrorism.” He noted the disruption Houthi attacks have caused through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, key waterways for energy and cargo shipments between Asia and Europe through Egypt's Suez Canal. 

“We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective,” Trump said. 




Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. and the United Kingdom began a series of airstrikes against the Houthis starting in January 2024. A December report by The International Institute for Strategic Studies said the U.S. and its partners struck the Houthis over 260 times up to that point.

U.S. military officials during that period acknowledged having a far-wider target list for possible strikes. While the Biden administration didn't go too far into explaining its targeting, analysts believe officials largely were trying to avoid civilian casualties and not rekindle Yemen's stalemated war, which pits the Houthis and their allies against the country's exiled government and their local and international allies, like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

The Trump administration, however, appears willing to go after more targets, based on the weekend's strikes and public remarks made by officials. 

“We're doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping,” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS News' “Face The Nation” on Sunday. “That's the mission here, and it will continue until that's carried out.”

Rubio added: “Some of the key people involved in those missile launches are no longer with us, and I can tell you that some of the facilities that they used are no longer existing, and that will continue.” 

Israel also launched its own airstrikes on Houthi-held sites, including the port city of Hodeida, over the rebels' missile and drone attacks targeting Israel.

In two words: More attacks. 

The Houthis said last week they'll again target “Israeli” ships traveling through Mideast waterways like the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, because of Israel's blocking of aid to the Gaza Strip. No rebel attack targeting commercial shipping has been reported as of Monday morning. 

However, the new U.S. campaign likely could inspire Houthi attacks at sea or on land beyond American warships. The rebels previously targeted oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, two countries deeply involved in Yemen's war since 2015. 

“Although the U.S. has been striking at Houthi targets for over a year, the scope and scale of this new campaign, including the targeting of senior Houthi figures, marks a significant escalation in the conflict,” analysts at the Eurasia Group said Monday. 

Gulf Arab countries “will distance themselves from ongoing hostilities but now face threats to their major oil infrastructure. The Houthis will want to hit President Donald Trump where it hurts, oil prices.” 

Meanwhile, the Houthis likely will expand their possible targets for ship attacks, meaning shippers will continue to stay out of the region, said Jakob P. Larsen, the head of maritime security for BIMCO, the largest international association representing shipowners.

Iran long has armed the Houthis, who are members of Islam's minority Shiite Zaydi sect, which ruled Yemen for 1,000 years until 1962. Tehran routinely denies arming the rebels, despite physical evidence, numerous seizures and experts tying the weapons back to Iran. That's likely because Tehran wants to avoid sanctions for violating a United Nations arms embargo on the Houthis. 

The Houthis now form the strongest group within Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance.” Others like Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant group Hamas have been decimated by Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas that sparked Israel's war of attrition in the Gaza Strip. Allied Shiite militias in Iraq largely have kept their heads down since the U.S. launched retaliatory attacks last year over a drone attack that killed three American troops and injured at least 34 others at a military base in Jordan.

While Iranian state television aired footage of civilian casualties from the weekend strikes in Yemen, top political leaders stayed away from suggestion Tehran itself would get involved in the fight. Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami notably underscored the Houthis made their own decisions — while not offering any warning over what would happen if the strikes killed any members of the Guard's expeditionary Quds Force, who are believed to actively support the rebels on the ground. 

“We have always declared — and we declare again today — that the Yemenis are an independent and free nation in their own land, with an independent national policy,” Salami said.

Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, speaking to ABC's “This Week” on Sunday, warned Guard officials training the Houthis “will be on the table too” as possible targets for attack. 

Meanwhile, Iran is still trying to determine how to respond to a letter from Trump aiming to restart negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said Monday officials continue to review the letter and will respond “after investigations are completed.”

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi separately traveled Sunday to Oman, which long has been an interlocutor between Tehran and the West. The Houthis also operate a political office in the sultanate.

The attacks on the Houthis are “a not-so-subtle signal to Iran, as President Trump has been unequivocal in his insistence that Iran return to the negotiating table to deal with its nuclear program,” the New York-based Soufan Center said in an analysis Monday.

Al-Arabiya TV, a Saudi backed Satellite channel, aired footage on Monday of its crews as they came under fire at the Syrian Lebanese border. Fighting erupted along the border between Lebanon and Syria overnight into Monday, Syrian state media reported, after three Syrian soldiers were killed in earlier clashes.

BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon's president on Monday ordered troops to retaliate for gunfire from the Syrian side of the border after more deadly fighting erupted overnight along the tense frontier.

The fighting occurred after Syria's interim government accused militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group of crossing into Syria on Saturday, abducting three soldiers and killing them on Lebanese soil.

It was the most serious cross-border fighting since the ouster of former Syrian President Bashar Assad in December.

Syrian News Channel, citing an unnamed Defense Ministry official, said the Syrian army shelled “Hezbollah gatherings that killed Syrian soldiers” along the border. Hezbollah denied involvement in a statement on Sunday.

Information Minister Paul Morkos said Lebanon's defense minister told a Cabinet meeting that the three killed were smugglers. He added that one child was killed and six people were wounded on the Lebanese side.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said five Syrian soldiers were killed during Monday's clashes. Footage circulated online and in local media showed families toward the Lebanese town of Hermel.

Lebanon's state news agency reported that fighting intensified Monday evening near Hermel.

“What is happening along the eastern and northeastern border cannot continue and we will not accept that it continues,” Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun said on X. “I have given my orders to the Lebanese army to retaliate against the source of fire.”




Aoun added that he asked Lebanon's foreign minister, who is currently in Brussels for a donors conference on Syria, to contact Syrian officials to resolve the problem “and prevent further escalation.”

Violence recently spiked in the area between the Syrian military and armed Lebanese Shiite clans closely allied with the former government of Assad, based in Lebanon's Al-Qasr border village.

Lebanese media and the observatory say clans were involved in the abductions that sparked the latest clashes.

The Lebanese and Syrian armies said they have opened channels of communication to ease tensions. Lebanon's military also said it returned the bodies of the three killed Syrians. Large numbers of Lebanese troops have been deployed in the area.

Lebanese media reported low-level fighting at dawn after an attack on a Syrian military vehicle. The number of casualties was unclear.

Early Monday, four Syrian journalists embedded with the Syrian army were lightly wounded after an artillery shell fired from the Lebanese side of the border hit their position. They accused Hezbollah of the attack.

Meanwhile, senior Hezbollah legislator Hussein Haj Hassan in an interview with Lebanon's Al Jadeed television accused fighters from the Syrian side of crossing into Lebanese territory and attacking border villages. His constituency is the northeastern Baalbek-Hermel province, which has borne the brunt of the clashes.

Lebanon has been seeking international support to boost funding for its military as it gradually deploys troops along its porous northern and eastern borders with Syria as well as its southern border with Israel.

LONDON (AP) — New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney was meeting with the leaders of Britain and France on Monday during his first official overseas trip, seeking support from two of Ottawa's oldest allies as U.S. President Donald Trump targets Canada's sovereignty and economy.

Canadians have criticized the leaders of the two countries that founded Canada for their muted response to Trump's attacks. He has imposed whopping tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum and repeatedly commented on turning Canada into the 51st state.

Carney and French President Emmanuel Macron did not take journalists' questions, and a joint news conference was not scheduled with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, either. An official familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the Canadians proposed a press conference in Paris but the French declined.

Macron did not address Trump's attacks on Canada ahead of their talks but noted that tariffs only bring inflation and damage to supply chains.

“In the current international context, we want to be able to develop our most strategic projects with our closest, more loyal partners,” Macron added.

In London, Carney was received at Buckingham Palace by King Charles III, the head of state in Canada. The monarch congratulated Carney on his recent victory. He was sworn in on Friday.




The Canadian prime minister pointed at his lapel pin.

“Bit of a disaster today, sir. My Order of Canada pin broke,” Carney said.

“Do you want mine?” the king asked.

The meeting with Starmer followed.

On Tuesday, Carney will travel to the edge of Canada's Arctic to reaffirm the country's security and sovereignty.

Carney has chosen the two European capitals that shaped Canada's early existence. During his swearing-in, he noted the country was built on the bedrock of three peoples, French, English and Indigenous.

He added that Canada is fundamentally different from America and will “never, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the United States.”

“I want to ensure that France, and the whole of Europe, works enthusiastically with Canada, the most European of non-European countries,” Carney said, but vowed to “maintain the most positive relations possible with the United States.”

Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said other leaders are “playing it safe” and making sure to avoid gaffes at a time of international tension around Trump's actions and rhetoric.

Carney's choice of itinerary emphasizes Canada's strong connection with the two former colonial powers, Béland said, and noted that “the fact that Canada never broke away from the U.K. in a violent fashion is a key historical and institutional difference between the United States and Canada.”

The trip to London was a kind of homecoming. Carney became the first non-British governor in the Bank of England's 319-year history when he took the job in July 2013. He served until March 2020.

Carney has said he's ready to meet with Trump if he shows respect for Canadian sovereignty. He said he doesn't plan to visit Washington at the moment but hopes to have a phone call with the president soon.

His government is also reviewing the purchase of U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets in light of Trump's trade war.

Meanwhile, Macron has been increasing efforts to persuade France's allies to move away from purchases of American military hardware. That coincides with mounting concerns in Europe that European defenses are overly dependent on U.S. weaponry, technical support and goodwill.

Macron also touched on the French-British plan for securing any ceasefire in Ukraine, and said that “Canada and France are powers of peace, reliable allies, which will take part together in this effort.” He did not give details.

Carney spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by phone late Sunday and invited him to the G7 summit this summer that Canada is hosting.

Carney is expected to call a parliamentary election by the end of the week, to take place in late April or early May. Canada's governing Liberal Party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war. Now, the party and its new leader could come out on top.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — The videos roll through TikTok in 30-second flashes.



Migrants trek in camouflage through dry desert terrain. Dune buggies roar up to the United States-Mexico border barrier. Families with young children pass through gaps in the wall. Helicopters, planes, yachts, tunnels and jet skis stand by for potential customers.



Laced with emojis, the videos posted by smugglers offer a simple promise: If you don't have a visa in the U.S., trust us. We'll get you over safely.



At a time when legal pathways to the U.S. have been slashed and criminal groups are raking in money from migrant smuggling, social media apps like TikTok have become an essential tool for smugglers and migrants alike. The videos — taken to cartoonish extremes — offer a rare look inside a long elusive industry and the narratives used by trafficking networks to fuel migration north.

“With God's help, we're going to continue working to fulfill the dreams of foreigners. Safe travels without robbing our people,” wrote one enterprising smuggler.



As President Donald Trump begins to ramp up a crackdown at the border and migration levels to the U.S. dip, smugglers say new technologies allow networks to be more agile in the face of challenges, and expand their reach to new customers — a far cry from the old days when each village had its trusted smuggler.



“In this line of work, you have to switch tactics,” said a woman named Soary, part of a smuggling network bringing migrants from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name would not be shared out of concern that authorities would track her down. “TikTok goes all over the world.”






Soary, 24, began working in smuggling when she was 19, living in El Paso, where she was approached by a friend about a job. She would use her truck to pick up migrants who had recently jumped the border. Despite the risks involved with working with trafficking organizations, she said it earned her more as a single mother than her previous job putting in hair extensions.



As she gained more contacts on both sides of the border, she began connecting people from across the Americas with a network of smugglers to sneak them across borders and eventually into the U.S.



Like many smugglers, she would take videos of migrants speaking to the camera after crossing the border to send over WhatsApp as evidence to loved ones that her clients had gotten to their destination safely. Now she posts those clips to TikTok. 



TikTok says the platform strictly prohibits human smuggling and reports such content to law enforcement. 



The use of social media to facilitate migration took off around 2017 and 2018, when activists built massive WhatsApp groups to coordinate the first major migrant caravans traveling from Central America to the U.S., according to Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University focused on the migrant smuggling industry.



Later, smugglers began to infiltrate those chats and use the choice social media app of the day, expanding to Facebook and Instagram.

Migrants, too, began to document their often perilous voyages north, posting videos trekking through the jungles of the Darien Gap dividing Colombia and Panama, and after being released by extorting cartels.



A 2023 study by the United Nations reported that 64% of the migrants they interviewed had access to a smart phone and the internet during their migration to the U.S.



Around the time of the study's release, as use of the app began to soar, that Correa-Cabrera said she began to see smuggling ads skyrocket on TikTok.



“It's a marketing strategy,” Correa-Cabrera said. “Everyone was on TikTok, particularly after the pandemic, and then it began to multiply.”



Last year, Soary, the smuggler, said she began to publish videos of migrants and families in the U.S. with their faces covered and photos of the U.S.-Mexico border with messages like: “We'll pass you through Ciudad Juárez, no matter where you are. Fence jumping, treks and by tunnel. Adults, children and the elderly.”



Hundreds of videos examined by the AP feature thick wads of cash, people crossing through the border fence by night, helicopters and airplanes supposedly used by coyotes, smugglers cutting open cacti in the desert for migrants to drink from and even crops of lettuce with text reading “The American fields are ready!”



The videos are often layered over heavy northern Mexican music with lyrics waxing romantically about being traffickers. Videos are published by accounts with names alluding to “safe crossing,” “USA destinations,” “fulfilling dreams” or “polleros,” as smugglers are often called.

Narratives shift based on the political environment and immigration policies in the U.S. During the Biden administration, posts would advertise getting migrants access to asylum applications through the administration's CBP One app, which Trump ended. 



Amid Trump's crackdown, posts have shifted to dispelling fears that migrants will be captured, promising American authorities have been paid off. Smugglers openly taunt U.S. authorities: one shows himself smoking what appears to be marijuana right in front of the border wall; another even takes a jab at Trump, referring to the president as a “high-strung gringo.”



Comments are dotted with emojis of flags and baby chickens, a symbol meaning migrant among smugglers, and other users asking for prices and more information.



Cristina, who migrated because she struggled make ends meet in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, was among those scrolling in December after the person she had hired to smuggle her to the U.S. abandoned her and her partner in Ciudad Juárez.



“In a moment of desperation, I started searching on TikTok and, well, with the algorithm videos began to pop up,” she said. “It took me a half an hour” to find a smuggler.



After connecting, smugglers and migrants often negotiate on encrypted apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, doing a careful dance to gain each other's trust. Cristina, now living in Phoenix, said she decided to trust Soary because she was a woman and posted videos of families, something the smuggler admitted was a tactic to gain migrants' trust.



Smugglers, migrants and authorities warn that such videos have been used to scam migrants or lure them into traps at a time when cartels are increasingly using kidnapping and extortion as a means to rake in more money.



One smuggler, who asked to only be identified by his TikTok name “The Corporation” due to fear of authorities tracking him down said other accounts would steal his migrant smuggling network's videos of customers saying to camera they arrived safely in the U.S.



“And there's not much we can do legally. I mean, it's not like we can report them,” he said with a laugh.

In other cases, migrants say that they were forced by traffickers to take the videos even if they haven't arrived safely to their destinations.



The illicit advertisements have fueled concern among international authorities like the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration, which warned in a report about the use of the technology that “networks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and evasive, thus challenging government authorities to address new, non-traditional forms of this crime.”



In February, a Mexican prosecutor also confirmed to the AP that they were investigating a network of accounts advertising crossings through a tunnel running under the border fence between Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. But investigators would not provide more details.



In the meantime, hundreds of accounts post videos of trucks crossing border, of stacks of cash and migrants, faces covered with emojis, promising they made it safely across the border.



“We're continuing to cross and we're not scared,” one wrote. 






Illustrations are based on hundreds of videos posted on TikTok examined by the AP that advertise travel to the U.S. to migrants. Videos are often laced with emojis, make bold promises of success and promise safe travel.

After a stint in Guantanamo Bay, a Venezuelan deported from the US adjusts to his homeland

MARACAIBO, Venezuela (AP) — Jhoan Bastidas was deported from the United States and spent 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, watched by cameras and eating small meals that left him hungry.

“I was locked up all day in a little room — I counted the feet: 7 wide and 13 long — without being able to do anything, without a book, looking at the walls,” Bastidas, 25, said in his father's middle-class home in the western city of Maracaibo, Venezuela.

Three weeks after he was returned to Venezuela under President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, Bastidas is just starting to make sense of it all — how he is back in the once-prosperous hometown that he left as a teenager; how tattoos on his chest earned him a reputation as a criminal; and how he became one of the few migrants to set foot on the naval base best known for housing terrorism suspects.

Bastidas and roughly 350 other Venezuelans who migrated to the U.S. are trying to piece their lives together after they were deported to their troubled country over the past few weeks. About 180 of them spent up to 16 days at the base in Guantanamo before being flown to Honduras by U.S. authorities and, from there, to Venezuela by the government of President Nicolás Maduro.

It is part of the White House's efforts to deport a record number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Trump's government has alleged Venezuelans sent to the naval base are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which originated in the South American country, but it has offered little evidence to back that up.




“It was all very hard; all those experiences were very hard,” Bastidas said. “You have to be strong in the face of all those problems, you know, but I saw so much hate.”

More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their homeland since 2013, when its oil-dependent economy came undone and Maduro became president. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after the COVID-19 pandemic, they increasingly set their sights on the U.S. 

Venezuela has refused to take back its own citizens from the U.S. for years, with brief, limited exceptions such as the recent flights.

Over the weekend, the U.S. government transferred hundreds of immigrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador after Trump invoked an 18th century wartime law to speed up deportations of alleged Tren de Aragua members. The Trump administration, however, has not provided any evidence to back up the gang-membership claim. 

The immigrants were transferred even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to expedite mass deportations. 

Bastidas, his mother and siblings left Maracaibo in 2018, one of the harshest years of the country's protracted crisis. As they tested their luck in Peru and then settled in Colombia, people living in Venezuela lost jobs, formed long lines outside near-empty grocery stores and went hungry.

Their hometown saw businesses shutter and entire families sell their belongings and move away. The hourslong power outages that became everyday occurrences starting in 2019 pushed even more people to abandon Maracaibo.

He set off for Texas in November 2023, bankrolled by a brother whose promise of a car and a food delivery job in Utah convinced him to migrate.

Bastidas turned himself in to U.S. authorities after reaching the border with Mexico and was taken to a detention facility in El Paso, Texas. He remained there until early February, when one morning he was handcuffed, driven to an airport and put in an airplane without being told where it was headed.

After the aircraft landed, fellow passengers thought they were in Venezuela, but when he reached the door and only saw “gringos,” Bastidas said, he concluded they were wrong. When he saw “Guantanamo” written on the floor, it did not mean anything to him. He had never heard that word before.

When inside the cell, Bastidas said, he could never tell the time of day because its only window was a small glass panel at the top of the door looking into the building. He said he only saw sunlight every three days for an hour, which was the recreation time he was allowed to spend in what he described as a “cage.”

Bastidas said his hands and feet were shackled whenever he left his cell, including when he went to shower every three days.  At one point, he and other detainees were given small Bibles, and they began praying together, reading Scripture loudly and placing their ears against the door to hear each other.

“We used to say that the one who was going to get us out was God because we didn't see any other solutions. We didn't have anyone to lean on,” Bastidas added.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.

Trump has said he planned  to send “the worst” to the base in Cuba, including members of the Tren de Aragua. Bastidas said he is not part of the gang and believes the U.S. authorities used his tattoos to wrongly catalog him as a member of the criminal organization.

When asked which tattoos he thinks authorities misjudged, his father pulled down the neck of Bastidas' white T-shirt and pointed to two black, eight-pointed stars, each inked on one side of the chest, below the collarbones. 

The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit attempting to block further transfers to Guantanamo alleging cruelty by the guards and suicide attempts by at least three people held there.

Bastidas and other Venezuelans returned to Venezuela from Guantanamo on Feb. 20. Armed state intelligence service agents dropped them off at their homes.

Bastidas spent the next two weeks resting. He then began working at a hot dog stand.

Abandoned storefronts and homes are everywhere in Maracaibo, which once was a magnet for immigrants looking for good-paying jobs in and around nearby oil fields. But corruption, mismanagement and eventual U.S. economic sanctions saw production — and population — decline steadily.

Few people might know Bastidas by name in his sweltering hometown, but practically everyone in Maracaibo knows someone who has migrated. So, news of the Venezuelans' transfer to Guantanamo was shared seemingly endlessly on social media and WhatsApp, setting off debates over their living conditions and alleged gang affiliations as well as the complex crisis that drove them to migrate in the first place.

Bastidas is leaning into faith to ignore the noise and move forward.

“I see it as a kind of test that the Lord put me through,” he said. “He has another purpose for me. It wasn't for me to be (in the U.S.), and he kept me there (in detention) for some reason.”

KOCANI, North Macedonia (AP) — As families gathered at a hospital for updates, Tomco Stojanov already knew his son's devastating fate: 25-year-old Andrej died trying to save others in a nightclub fire that left dozens dead in North Macedonia, including many trampled during a desperate bid to escape. 

“Thank you for your condolences, but my pain is incurable. The wound is incurable,” Stojanov said, holding up a photograph of his son, clean-shaven and wearing a suit jacket. 

“He died while returning and entering to save other people. And he was pushed, run over, that's how my son died.” 

North Macedonia is grappling with the loss of dozens of young lives in Sunday's nightclub inferno in the eastern town of Kocani, and trying to hold those responsible to account and prevent another calamity.

Authorities were investigating allegations of bribery surrounding the fire in the nightclub, which was crammed with young revelers and at double capacity. Kocani's mayor resigned Monday over the emerging scandal.

Fire tore through the overcrowded Club Pulse during a live concert, leaving 59 people dead and more than 150 injured from burns, smoke inhalation and being trampled in the panicked rush toward the building's single exit.

Videos showed sparkling pyrotechnics on the stage hitting the club's ceiling and igniting the blaze as a band played.

Bribes to authorities to skip licensing requirements and skirt safety regulations are commonplace in North Macedonia, practices that have caught the attention of Western governments.




The European Union has repeatedly expressed concerns over pervasive corruption in the country, identifying it as a major obstacle to the country's accession to the bloc. 

Silent protests against corruption were held Monday in Kocani, joined by thousands of residents and separately by university students in Skopje.

“Justice is expected, that is what we all expect so that there are no such similar situations in the future,” Stavre Janev said at the Kocani protest.

The protesters' anger boiled over, with some toppling a van and smashing windows of a storefront — both belonging to one of the club owners. 

The latest in a string of deadly nightclub fires around the world, Sunday's tragedy shook this nation of 2 million, where close-knit extended family bonds made the disaster personal to many. Clubgoers as young as 16 were among the casualties, and the nation declared seven days of mourning.

“We are all in shock, and I am shocked myself: as a mother, as a person, as a president,” North Macedonian President Gordana Davkova Siljanovska said in an address to the nation Sunday night.

North Macedonia's government ordered a sweeping three-day inspection to be carried out at all nightclubs and cabarets across the country, starting Monday.

State prosecutor Ljupco Kocevski said a preliminary inspection of the Club Pulse nightclub had revealed numerous safety code violations, including a lack of emergency exits, an insufficient number of fire extinguishers and improper access for emergency vehicles. 

The fire caused the roof of the single-story building to partially collapse, revealing the charred remains of wooden beams and debris.

“The omissions are significant. I can confidently say that this is a failure of the system,” the prosecutor told reporters, also noting the lack of an overhead extinguisher system and fire alarms, and the use of flammable materials to line the inside walls. 

Speaking to reporters in Skopje, Interior Minister Panche Toshevski said it appeared the club's owners paid bribes to former officials to issue a forged license and turn a blind eye to the venue operating far beyond capacity and in violation of fire code. Former economy minister Khreshnik Beteshi was being questioned at a police station in Skopje, his lawyer Elenko Milanov told reporters.

The country was in mourning as people watched harrowing scenes in the town of 25,000 people, where rescuers for hours carried out the grim task of removing the charred bodies of clubgoers.

A state coroner said the bodies were being brought for identification in batches from morgues due to the high number of people killed. 

Flags around the country have been lowered to half-staff, and the death toll may rise further, with 20 of the injured in critical condition, Health Minister Arben Taravari said. 

Neighboring and nearby countries — Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey — along with a number of others have already accepted some 50 patients with the most serious injuries, while several countries are also sending medical teams to North Macedonia, officials said. 

“All patients who have been transferred abroad are currently in stable condition. We hope it stays that way and that we will receive positive news from abroad,” Taravari said. 

Officials said 10 people remain in police custody for questioning in Kocani, some 115 kilometers (72 miles) east of the capital, Skopje. Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski added that a preliminary inspection revealed the club was operating without a proper license. He said the number of people inside the club was at least double its official capacity of 250.

Condolences poured in from leaders around Europe as well as from the office of the hospitalized Pope Francis.

Late Sunday, Kocani's residents held a candlelight vigil in support of mourning families, waiting in long lines to light church candles. 

Beti Delovska, an economist from Skopje, said North Macedonia has never experienced a tragedy like this, with dozens of young people vanishing in minutes. She noted that many young people with bright futures had already left the nation, in search of opportunities elsewhere.

North Macedonia “is on its death bed,” Delovska said. “We have no more credible institutions, the health system is completely dismantled, education is poor, judiciary is partisan and corrupt to the bone,” she said.

“I do believe now that only God can save (North) Macedonia.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday appointed Andrii Hnatov as the new chief of the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces, as the country looks to restructure and strengthen its military while its engaged in combat in Russia's Kursk region and facing increasing pressure in Donetsk. 

Hnatov replaced Anatoliy Barhylevych, who held the position since February 2024. The appointment was announced by the general staff via its Telegram channel Sunday.

“We are systematically transforming the Armed Forces of Ukraine to enhance their combat effectiveness,” Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said.

Barhylevych will now serve as the general inspector of Ukraine's Defense Ministry. Umerov emphasized that Barhylevych would “remain part of the team,” overseeing military standards and strengthening discipline in the army. 

Oleksandr Syrskyi remains in place as commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces.

Zelenskyy has made frequent personnel changes within the Ukrainian government and military since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.

This change in personnel comes as fighting continues in Russia's Kursk region, where Ukraine's General Staff said that Ukrainian troops had been involved in eight combat clashes on Sunday.

Ukraine's army stunned Russia in August last year by attacking across the border and taking control of an estimated 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of land, but Ukraine's forces are now in retreat — meaning Ukraine has all but lost a valuable bargaining chip, as momentum builds for a ceasefire with Russia. On Friday, Russia claimed control of Sudzha, the largest town that Ukraine had occupied in the Kursk region.

Ukraine is also battling under growing pressure in its eastern Donetsk region, where Russian troops have been advancing for months.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday he will seek to dismiss the head of the internal security service this week, deepening a power struggle focused largely on who bears responsibility for the Hamas attack that sparked the war in Gaza.

Netanyahu's effort to remove Ronen Bar as director of the Shin Bet comes as the security service investigates close aides of the prime minister. Netanyahu said he has had “ongoing distrust” with Bar, and “this distrust has grown over time.”

Bar responded by saying he planned to continue in the post for the near future, citing “personal obligations” to finish “sensitive investigations,” free the remaining hostages in Gaza and prepare potential successors.

Bar also criticized Netanyahu's expectation of a personal loyalty that contradicts the public interest. But he emphasized that he would respect any legal decision regarding his tenure.

Israel's attorney general said Netanyahu must clarify the legal basis for his decision before taking any action.

The Shin Bet is responsible for monitoring Palestinian militant groups, and recently issued a report accepting responsibility for its failures around the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack. It also criticized Netanyahu, saying failed government policies helped create the climate that led to it.

While the army concluded in a recent report that it underestimated Hamas' capabilities, Shin Bet said it had a “deep understanding of the threat.” In veiled criticism of the government, the agency said its attempts to thwart the threat were not implemented.

“The investigation reveals a long and deliberate disregard from the political leadership from the organization's warnings,” Bar's statement said.

Netanyahu has resisted calls for an official state commission of inquiry into the Oct. 7 attack and has tried to blame the failures on the army and security agencies. In recent months, a number of senior security officials, including a defense minister and army chief, have been fired or forced to step down.

Bar has been one of the few senior security officials since the Oct. 7 attack to remain in office.

If successful in removing him, Netanyahu would be expected to appoint a loyalist in his place, slowing any momentum for the commission of inquiry. The prime minister said removing him would help Israel “achieve its war goals and prevent the next disaster.”

Netanyahu's proposed resolution for Bar's dismissal would need the approval of parliament, the Knesset, and it is likely he has support to pass it.

However, a personnel decision of this magnitude must get the attorney general's approval, said Amichai Cohen, a senior research fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute think tank.

In her letter to Netanyahu warning he could not go ahead without clarification, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara added that he should “pay attention to the fact that the role of the Shin Bet is not to serve the personal trust of the prime minister,” according to a statement from her office.

The two have a combative relationship, with the prime minister accusing Baharav-Miara of meddling in government decisions. Earlier this month, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, one of Netanyahu's biggest supporters, initiated the process of firing her.

Cohen also called Netanyahu's decision “very problematic.” He said it illustrates the conflict of interest regarding the Shin Bet findings around the Oct. 7 attack and the agency's investigations into connections between the prime minister's office and Qatar, a mediator in talks on the war in Gaza.

Netanyahu is angry that the Shin Bet is investigating members of his staff for their dealings with Qatar.

Eli Feldstein, Netanyahu's former spokesperson, was reported by Israel's Channel 12 to have worked for a Doha-based firm that recruited Israeli journalists to write pro-Qatar stories. Israel's left-leaning daily, Haaretz, has reported that two other Netanyahu staffers, Jonatan Urich and Yisrael Einhorn, allegedly built a campaign to bolster Qatar's image ahead of the 2022 World Cup there.

The Shin Bet, and Bar, have been closely involved with the Gaza hostage negotiations. Netanyahu recently removed Bar from the negotiating team and replaced him with a loyalist, Cabinet minister Ron Dermer. Israeli media have reported on policy differences between the negotiators, who have pushed for a hostage deal, and Netanyahu, who threatens to resume the war.

The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a good-governance civil society group, called Netanyahu's announcement a “declaration of war on the rule of law” and claimed that he does not have the authority to take the step against Bar because of the investigations into his office.

The group's chair, Eliad Shraga, called the announcement unlawful and “an extreme example of conflict of interest.”

Opposition leader Yair Lapid said he would appeal Bar's dismissal, calling the resolution “shameful” and politically motivated.

Since Netanyahu was indicted on corruption charges in 2019, he has claimed to be the victim of a “deep state” conspiracy by the media, judiciary and other unelected civil servants.

He launched a plan to overhaul the country's judicial system in early 2023, sparking months of street protests by demonstrators who accused him of trying to weaken the country's system of checks and balances.

Israeli media have said Bar was among top security officials warning ahead of the Oct. 7 attack that the strife was sending an image of weakness to Israel's enemies.

Footage released by Yemen's Houthi rebels showed people rushing to the site of a U.S. strike in Yemen's Saada province, and looking for bodies buried in the rubble.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Iran-backed rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

Yemeni TV showed smoke rising above the capital Sanaa on Saturday night after US President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday.

CAIRO (AP) — The United States and Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen are both vowing escalation after the U.S. launched airstrikes to deter the rebels from attacking military and commercial vessels on one of the world's busiest shipping corridors.



The Houthi-run Health Ministry said the U.S. strikes killed at least 53 people, including five women and two children, and wounded almost 100 in the capital of Sanaa and other provinces, including Saada, the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia.



“We're not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot. And so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that,” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS on Sunday. 



President Donald Trump on Saturday vowed to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks, and warned that Tehran would be held “fully accountable” for their actions.



The Houthis have repeatedly targeted shipping in the Red Sea, sinking two vessels, in what they call acts of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel has been at war with Hamas, another Iranian ally. The attacks stopped when a Israel-Hamas ceasefire took hold in January — a day before Trump took office — but last week the Houthis said they would renew attacks against Israeli vessels after Israel cut off the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza this month.



There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.

This image taken from video provided by the U.S. Navy shows an aircraft launching from the USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea before airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen, Saturday, March 15, 2025. (U.S. Navy via AP)












The U.S. airstrikes were one of the most extensive attacks against the Houthis since the war in Gaza began in October 2023.



Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, on Sunday told ABC that the strikes “actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.” He didn't identify them or give evidence. Rubio said some Houthi facilities had been destroyed.



In a speech aired Sunday night, the rebels' secretive leader, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, warned: “We will confront escalation with escalation.”



“We will respond to the American enemy in its raids, in its attacks, with missile strikes, by targeting its aircraft carrier, its warships, its ships,” al-Houthi said. “However, we also still have escalation options. If it continues its aggression, we will move to additional escalation options.”



He did not elaborate. The Houthis have targeted U.S. warships and shot down American drones flying over Yemen.



The rebels on Sunday claimed to have targeted the USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group with missiles and a drone.



According to a U.S. official, the Houthis did fire drones and at least one missile in response to the U.S. attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide updated information on operations, said that beginning at about midnight local time in Yemen, the Houthis fired 11 drones and at least one missile over about 12 hours. Ten of the drones were intercepted by U.S. Air Force fighter jets and one was intercepted by a Navy F/A-18 fighter jet. The missile fell into the water far from the ship, and nothing came close to hitting either the carrier or the warships in its strike group. 



The spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a statement called for “utmost restraint and a cessation of all military activities,” while warning of the “grave risks” to the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen, the Arab world's poorest nation.



Rubio said that over the past 18 months the Houthis had attacked the U.S. Navy “directly” 174 times and targeted commercial shipping 145 times using “guided precision anti-ship weaponry.”



The attacks sparked the most serious combat the U.S. Navy had seen since World War II.



On Sunday, the head of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami, denied his country was involved in the Houthis' attacks, saying it “plays no role in setting the national or operational policies” of the militant groups it is allied with across the region, according to state-run TV.



Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, writing on X, urged the U.S. to halt its airstrikes and said Washington cannot dictate Iran's foreign policy.



The U.S. and others have long accused Iran of providing military aid to the rebels. The U.S. Navy has seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weaponry it said was bound for the Houthis.



The United States, Israel and Britain previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but the new operation was conducted solely by the U.S. It was the first strike on the Houthis under the second Trump administration.



The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, is in the Red Sea and was part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.

BRUSSELS (AP) — International donors gathered on Monday in a show of support for Syria, hoping to encourage the new leaders of the conflict-ravaged country toward a peaceful political transition following the ouster of President Bashar Assad in December.

Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani attended the conference — the ninth of its kind — in a first for a top official from Damascus.

But the United States, one of Syria's top donors, wasn't expected to offer assistance as the Trump administration is reviewing all foreign aid. It contributed almost $1.2 billion to Syria and the region last year.

Ministers and representatives from Western partners, Syria's regional neighbors, other Arab countries and U.N. agencies also attended the one-day meeting in Brussels, organized in haste by the European Union amid change sweeping the country.

Opening the meeting, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU was increasing its pledge to Syrians in the country and the region to almost 2.5 billion euros ($2.7 billion) for 2025 and 2026.

“We call on all of you who are here today to do the same, if possible, because at this critical time, the people of Syria need us more than ever,” von der Leyen said.

Syria's new leaders are trying to consolidate control over territory that was divided into de facto mini-states during nearly 14 years of civil war, and to rebuild the economy and infrastructure. The United Nations has estimated that it would cost at least $250 billion to rebuild Syria, while experts say that could reach at least $400 billion.




At the same time, Western governments are cutting back on aid spending, in part to use in defense budgets.

“We will give more, but we cannot fill the gap left by the U.S.,” EU Crisis Management Commissioner Hadja Lahbib told reporters. “We will need to share the burden.”

Security concerns are also making donors hesitate. Last week, an ambush on a Syrian security patrol by gunmen loyal to Assad triggered clashes. Some factions allied with the new government launched sectarian revenge attacks — primarily targeting Assad's Alawite minority sect — that monitoring groups say killed hundreds of civilians over several days.

The EU said that it will only support “a peaceful and inclusive transition, away from malign foreign interference, which guarantees the rights of all Syrians without distinction of any kind.”

The 27-nation bloc has begun to ease energy, transport and financial sector sanctions to encourage the new authorities, but many other Western sanctions remain in place. The EU can reintroduce sanctions if things don't go to the liking of Western backers.

Syria's foreign minister said that lifting the measures is no longer just a government demand but “a humanitarian and moral necessity.”

“We cannot talk about economic recovery and humanitarian development in Syria while restrictions continue to prevent even the arrival of medical equipment and spare parts to repair damaged hospitals and essential service facilities,” he said.

Syria's economy, infrastructure and institutions are in tatters. As a failed state, it could become another haven for extremists.

Amy Pope, director-general of the International Organization for Migration, urged donors to seize this opportunity to encourage the interim government to move in the right direction.

“It's critical that countries take advantage of the moment we're in,” Pope told The Associated Press.

“Of course, we all want to see an inclusive Syria,” she said. “We want to make sure there's accountability for human rights violations. But the answer is to engage more, not to engage less.”

Syrians have only a few hours of electricity each day. Water supplies are unreliable and often unsafe. Unemployment runs to 80% or 90%. Destruction is widespread.

Many government employees and experts needed to rebuild fled after the 2011 Arab Spring democracy movement collapsed into conflict and authoritarian rule under Assad.

The U.N. refugee agency said that last year around 7 million people were displaced in Syria. More than 4.7 million refugees are registered in neighboring countries, most in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.

The German government said that it would pledge around 300 million euros ($326 million) to help deal with the fallout from Syria's civil war. More than half will be used to help people in Syria, with other funding supporting Syrians and communities elsewhere.

Monday's conference was also focused on meeting Syria's economic needs. Infrastructure, health and education must be scaled up. Jobs and cash for work programs are needed so that Syrians can start to make a living.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to sign up to a ceasefire in its war against Ukraine now, if he is serious about peace.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for “active pressure” on Russia to end the war during a two-hour virtual meeting hosted by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

In his opening remarks Saturday to a virtual gathering of what he has termed the “coalition of the willing,” Starmer said Putin will “sooner or later” have to “come to the table.” The call is expected to delve into how countries can help Ukraine militarily and financially as well as gauging support for any future possible peacekeeping mission.

French President Emmanuel Macron has fleshed out some possible missions that could be undertaken by a military support force for Ukraine that Paris and London are working to put together with other nations, in a so-called “coalition of the willing” that could deploy after any ceasefire with Russia.

Speaking to French media ahead of an online summit that the U.K. hosted on Saturday, Macron said the French-British blueprint doesn't aim to deploy a “mass” of soldiers in Ukraine and instead envisages stationing troop contingents in key locations.

Macron's office said Sunday that it couldn't provide a recording of the French leader's exchange with reporters from regional French newspapers on Friday night. 

But according to La Dépêche du Midi and Le Parisien, the French president spoke of participating nations each deploying several thousand troops to “key points” in Ukraine. Their missions could include providing training and supporting Ukrainian defenses, to demonstrate long-term support for Kyiv, the reports quoted Macron as saying.

Macron added that the proposed contingents from countries that are members of the NATO alliance would serve as “a guarantee of security” for Ukraine and that “several European nations, and also non-European, have expressed their willingness to join such an effort when it is confirmed,” La Dépêche reported. 

Le Parisien cited Macron as saying that Moscow's agreement wasn't needed for such deployment. “Ukraine is sovereign. If it asks for Allied forces to be on its territory, it's not up to Russia to accept or not,” he said.




Following Saturday's two-hour virtual meeting, Starmer challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to sign up to a ceasefire in its war against Ukraine if he is serious about peace, and said allies will keep increasing the pressure on the Kremlin, including by moving planning for a peacekeeping force to an “operational phase.”

Around 30 leaders were involved in the call, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders from Australia, Canada and New Zealand, as well as officials from NATO and the European Union.

It was the second such meeting in two weeks, meant to help Ukraine face a change of approach by the U.S. following the return of President Donald Trump, as well as gauging support for any future possible peacekeeping mission. Many more countries were involved this time than the previous meeting on March 2. 

According to Starmer, military planners will convene again in the U.K. on Thursday to progress practical plans to support Ukraine's future security.

PARIS (AP) — Hey, America: Give the Statue of Liberty back to France. 

So says a French politician who is making headlines in his country for suggesting that the U.S. is no longer worthy of the monument that was a gift from France nearly 140 years ago.

As a member of the European Parliament and co-president of a small left-wing party in France, Raphaël Glucksmann cannot claim to speak for all of his compatriots. 

But his assertion in a speech this weekend that some Americans “have chosen to switch to the side of the tyrants” reflects the broad shockwaves that U.S. President Donald Trump's seismic shifts in foreign and domestic policy are triggering in France and elsewhere in Europe. 

“Give us back the Statue of Liberty,” Glucksmann said, speaking Sunday to supporters of his Public Place party, who applauded and whistled.

“It was our gift to you. But apparently you despise her. So she will be happy here with us,” Glucksmann said.

Dream on. 

UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural arm that has the statue on its list of World Heritage treasures, notes that the iconic monument is U.S. government property.

It was initially envisaged as a monumental gesture of French-American friendship to mark the 100th anniversary of the July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence.

But a war that erupted in 1870 between France and German states led by Prussia diverted the energies of the monument's designer, French sculptor Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi.




The gift also took time to be funded, with a decision taken that the French would pay for the statue and Americans would cover the costs of its pedestal.

Transported in 350 pieces from France, the statue was officially unveiled Oct. 28, 1886.

No. French-U.S. relations would have to drop off a cliff before Glucksmann found support from French President Emmanuel Macron's government.

For the moment, the French president is treading a fine line — trying to work with Trump and temper some of his policy shifts on the one hand but also pushing back hard against some White House decisions, notably Trump's tariff hikes.

Macron has let his prime minister, François Bayrou, play the role of being a more critical voice. Bayrou tore into the “brutality” that was shown to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during his White House visit and suggested that Trump's administration risked handing victory to Russia when it paused military aid to Ukraine. 

Glucksmann's party has been even more critical, posting accusations on its website that Trump is wielding power in an “authoritarian” manner and is “preparing to deliver Ukraine on a silver platter” to Russia.

In his speech, Glucksmann referenced New York poet Emma Lazarus' words about the statue, the “mighty woman with a torch” who promised a home for the “huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” 

“Today, this land is ceasing to be what it was,” Glucksmann said.

Palestinians in Gaza face severe food shortages due to Israel's blockade, forcing many to rely on charities for meals. Aid groups warn that famine risks are rising despite previous ceasefire gains.

A charity in northern Gaza has been distributing hot meals to war-weary Palestinians during Ramadan, as they struggle to feed their families under Israel's two-week blockade of Gaza. Many have turned to aid groups for food.

“We were forced to come to the charity due to the scarcity of materials,” said Hassan Radwan from Jabaliya refugee camp, where many live in tents over destroyed homes.

Aid groups warn that famine risks are rising, despite gains made during a recent ceasefire. ","{'href': 'https://www.euronews.com', 'title': 'Euronews'}"

        Belgium, which has voiced concern about Rwanda's support for rebels in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has said it will respond in kind.
    

Rwanda has severed all diplomatic ties with Belgium, amid fraught relations between the countries over fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). 

All Belgian diplomats must leave Rwanda within 48 hours, the Rwandan foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday.

The ministry added that the decision would ""safeguard"" its own national interests. 

""Belgium has clearly taken sides in a regional conflict and continues to systematically mobilise against Rwanda in different forums,"" it claimed. 

Belgian Foreign Minister Maxime Prévot called Rwanda's move ""disproportionate"", saying that his country would respond in kind. 

All governmental cooperation agreements between the countries would be cancelled and Rwandan diplomats would not be welcome in Belgium, he said. 

Kigali has been criticised by countries including Belgium for backing the M23 rebels, who in recent months have seized Goma and Bukavu, the two largest cities in eastern DRC. 

Their offensive has left scores dead and thousands displaced. 

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in eastern DRC, a mineral-rich area close to the border with Rwanda. 

The group's fighters claim they are protecting the rights of the region's ethnic Tutsis. 

However, the DRC's government has accused Rwanda of supported the rebels in a bid to control land in the area. 

Belgium has also accused Kigali of undermining the DRC's territorial integrity. 

As a result of the row, Rwanda announced last month that it was suspending its 2024-2029 bilateral aid programme with Belgium, claiming Brussels was sabotaging the country's access to ""development finance"".

At the time, Prévot said that Belgium would continue to raise awareness in pursuit of a ""peaceful solution to the conflict in the east of the DRC"". 

The severing of the countries' diplomatic ties came on the same day that the European Union announced sanctions against nine people — including five Rwandans — in connection with violence in the DRC. 

On Monday, the DRC said it would attend peace talks with the M23 group in Angola.

        Trump on Saturday vowed to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks and warned that Tehran would be held “fully accountable” for its ally's actions.
    

The United States launched fresh airstrikes on Yemen on Monday, according to the Houthis' Al Masirah TV, with the rebel group and US President Donald Trump both vowing escalation.

Over the weekend, US strikes killed at least 53 people in Yemen, according to the Houthi-run Health Ministry, including five women and two children, and wounded almost 100 in the capital of Sanaa and other provinces, including Saada, the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia.

Euronews could not independently verify these claims.

The US began its new campaign of airstrikes on Yemen on Saturday after the Iran-backed Houthis said last week that they would renew attacks against Israeli vessels after Israel cut off the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza this month. 

On Monday, the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah and Al Jawf governorate north of the capital Sanaa were targeted, Al Masirah said.

Trump on Saturday vowed to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks and warned that Tehran would be held “fully accountable” for its ally's actions.

The US airstrikes were one of the most extensive attacks against the Houthis since the war in Gaza began in October 2023.

The Houthis have repeatedly targeted shipping in the Red Sea, sinking two vessels, in what they call acts of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel has been at war with Hamas, another Iranian ally. 

The attacks stopped when the Israel-Hamas ceasefire took hold in January — a day before Trump took office.

“We're not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot. And so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that,"" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS on Sunday.

No Houthi attacks were reported before the weekend, but the group announced on Sunday that they had responded to Saturday's US strikes by launching an attack of 18 missiles and a drone on the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier and its accompanying warships in the northern Red Sea.

In a speech aired Sunday night, the Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi stated, “We will confront escalation with escalation.”

“We will respond to the American enemy in its raids, in its attacks, with missile strikes, by targeting its aircraft carrier, its warships, its ships,” al-Houthi said. “However, we also still have escalation options. If it continues its aggression, we will move to additional escalation options.”

On Sunday, head of Tehran's Revolutionary Guard Hossein Salami denied his country was involved in the Houthis' attacks, saying it “plays no role in setting the national or operational policies” of the militant groups it is allied with across the region, according to state-run media.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, writing on X, urged the US to halt its airstrikes and said Washington cannot dictate Iran's foreign policy.

The US and others have long accused Iran of providing military aid to the rebels. The US Navy has seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weaponry it said was bound for the Houthis.

The US, Israel and the UK previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but the new operation was conducted solely by Washington, marking the first strike on the Houthis under the second Trump administration.

        The US president said that he would talk to his Russian counterpart on Tuesday, after negotiators have pushed for Russia to back a US-Ukraine ceasefire proposal.
    

US President Donald Trump announced he would discuss ending the war in Ukraine with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. 

""A lot of work's been done over the weekend. We want to see if we can bring that war to an end,” Trump said late Sunday evening. ""I think we have a good chance,"" he added. 

Trump is trying to secure Russia's support for an interim 30-day ceasefire and halt in fighting, which Ukraine accepted last week.

“We will be talking about land. We will be talking about power plants,” Trump said, adding that negotiators had already discussed ""dividing up certain assets.""

His comments come as special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN that Trump and Putin were expected to speak this week. Witkoff, who recently visited Moscow to move negotiations forward, said that discussions with Putin had been ""positive"" and ""solutions-based"".

He sidestepped questions on several more difficult aspects of the ceasefire proposal, such as whether Putin would demand the surrender of Ukrainian forces in Kursk, a halt to Ukraine's military aid, and the recognition of Ukrainian territory occupied by Moscow forces as Russian. 

Last Thursday, Putin said he supported a truce but listed several questions that he said still had to be discussed, including the status of Ukrainian troops in the western Russian region of Kursk.

Among other things, Moscow has said it would not accept the deployment of European peacekeeping forces in Ukraine — an idea proposed by France and the UK.

French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday suggested in comments in several newspapers that Russia's acceptance of such troops — which he described as contingents of soldiers — was not needed as Ukraine was a sovereign state. 

""If Ukraine requests allied forces to be on its territory, it is not up to Russia to accept or reject them,"" Macron is quoted as saying. 

On Sunday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to discuss ""next steps"" following meetings in Saudi Arabia. 

Both agreed to ""working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia,"" a handout from the US State Department read, without mentioning the ceasefire proposal. 

For his part, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Putin of ""deliberately"" dragging out the ceasefire proposal to complicate the process and prolong the war. 

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer echoed Zelenskyy's criticism after hosting a virtual summit on Ukraine on Saturday, where he called Russia's response ""not good enough"".

The US-backed ceasefire proposal accepted by Ukraine following talks in Saudi Arabia called for a temporary halt in fighting, including in the Black Sea and across the frontline. 

Diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire deal come as Russia and Ukraine traded drone fire over the weekend and into Monday morning, according to officials from both countries. 

On Sunday, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the logistics hub of Sudzha in the Kursk region, days after Moscow claimed it had captured the area where Ukraine launched a surprise incursion last year.

        A deterioration in the EU's rule of law is has been observed for years, according to a recently released report. Democracy indexes related to the justice system, anti-corruption and media freedom are facing persistent and systemic challenges.
    

While the situation varies from one member state to another, there is a broad and fundamental trend towards rule of law encountering severe challengers over the past few years, the Liberties Rule of Law report reveals.

The 1,000-page report — published on Monday by the Civil Liberties Union for Europe advocacy group — is released annually, with its sixth iteration released this year being the result of collaboration between 43 human rights organisations from 21 EU countries.

One of the most striking conclusions drawn from the organisation's research is the persistence of reported violations and the overarching deterioration of the rule of law across the EU. 

While individual countries exhibit variations, the broader observation is that all fundamental aspects of the rule of law – namely, the justice system, anti-corruption measures, media freedom, checks and balances, civic space and human rights – have encountered similar and deepening challenges over the past few years.

This clearly highlights persistent and systemic deficiencies in the rule of law across the bloc.

""We see a large number of countries where the rule of law continues to decline, most notably in Italy, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary,"" Viktor Z Kazai, senior rule of law expert at the Civil Liberties Union for Europe and one of the authors of the report, told Euronews. 

""The reason behind this is because the EU is not strong enough in its responses to rule of law decline. If rule of law violations are permitted, even tacitly, it encourages government leaders to further deteriorate the rule of law,"" Kazai added

The ""stagnators"" are countries that remained static or made minimal progress in their rule of law indicators. Greece, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands and Spain belong to this group.

The ""sliders"" are model democracies like Belgium, France, Germany and Sweden, demonstrating isolated but troubling declines in certain areas.

The ""dismantlers"" are countries where the rule of law is systematically and intentionally undermined in almost all areas, with this group comprising of Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Slovakia.

The weakest link, and repeat offender, was found to be Hungary. 

Some countries displayed marked attempts at improving the state of the rule of law domestically.

The “hard workers,” Estonia and the Czech Republic, showed signs of genuine and systemic efforts at making improvements, highlighting the successful role of civil society in creating positive change.

Poland, meanwhile, is considered a ""cautionary tale"" as the new government has attempted to restore judicial independence and media pluralism without achieving major progress, illustrating that addressing the compromised independence of institutions is a highly challenging and fragile endeavour. 

According to the report, it is crucial that the European Commission links the annual rule of law report with rule of law enforcement mechanisms, such as Article 7 infringement proceedings for member states that fail to respect European values or EU conditionality. 

The justice system still suffers from political manipulation, insufficient resources and barriers to legal aid, all of which undermine its independence, quality and efficiency, according to the report.

The big picture also shows that in the realm of fighting corruption, there is a persistent lack of transparency, weak law enforcement and inadequate protection of whistleblowers, leading to an erosion of trust in government integrity. 

Media freedom remains under threat in many countries, as political influence compromises the independence of regulatory bodies and concentrated ownership stifles pluralism, with journalists facing increasing harassment and legal challenges. 

Checks and balances are further weakened by the overuse of fast-track legislative processes, political interference in independent authorities and compromised integrity of the electoral system, all eroding democratic and legal control over the government. 

Furthermore, civic spaces have continued to shrink as widespread smear campaigns embolden governments to adopt restrictive laws, in particular when it comes to the right to peaceful protest and freedom of assembly and association.

Finally, human rights are under increasing pressure due to stricter migration policies, inadequate protection for vulnerable groups, and rising discrimination and hate speech impacting minorities across the region.

As the report's authors note, these internal challenges are unfolding against a shifting geopolitical landscape, with the rise of far-right populism and democratic backsliding in the US and global conflicts shaping Europe's political trajectory. 

The far-right's growing influence threatens EU unity, while Russia's war on Ukraine and declining transatlantic support for European security test the bloc's resilience. 

Migration policies are becoming more hardline, with states tightening borders and restricting asylum rights, often in violation of international law. 

Meanwhile, the EU's enforcement mechanisms remain weak, which has allowed illiberal trends to fester rather than send a clear message on the centrality of the rule of law and fundamental rights. 

Without decisive action, the EU risks further democratic erosion, internal fragmentation and weakened global standing.

“As far-right populism rises and democracy backslides in the US, Europe's rule of law crisis deepens. Growing far-right influence threatens EU unity, while Russia's war in Ukraine and rapidly transforming transatlantic ties test the bloc's resilience,"" the report stated.

""To safeguard the EU and the rules-based world, the European Commission must strengthen rule of law enforcement - linking it directly to Article 7, budgetary conditionality and infringement proceedings.”

        Britain intends to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while retaining a key UK-US military base on the island of Diego Garcia.
    

Two women born in the Chagos Islands want to take the British government to court over its plan to hand the Indian Ocean archipelago to Mauritius, their lawyers have said. 

Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, who are both British citizens, say that UK ministers have unlawfully excluded Chagossians from discussions about their homeland's future.

The Chagos Islands' inhabitants were forcibly displaced in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for a military base on Diego Garcia, the largest island in the territory.

They and their descendants now predominantly live in the UK, Mauritius and the Seychelles. 

In early October, the UK government announced a preliminary deal to cede control of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a former British colony which has long claimed the territory as its own. Under the agreement, Britain would retain the military base on Diego Garcia. 

But Chagossians like Dugasse and Pompe believe their voices have been ignored.

“Chagossians were removed from their place of birth, without their consultation, and have been treated badly for 60 years,” said Pompe.

“Since then we have been struggling to understand why we have been treated so poorly by the British government. I want to stay British and I also want the right to return to the Chagos Islands,” she added.

The women's lawyers have sent a legal letter to the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which has been given until 25 March to respond.

The British government's plan to hand the archipelago to Mauritius has stalled because of the Trump administration's concerns about the deal. 

Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State, has previously described the plan as “a serious threat” to US national security, given that Diego Garcia hosts around 2,500 military personnel. 

The US has said it considers the site “an all but indispensable platform” for security operations across the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa.

Complications have also arisen following a change in government in Mauritius, as well as disagreements over financial compensation for the lease of Diego Garcia to the UK.

The sovereignty of the Chagos Islands has been the subject of international legal disputes for years. 

In 2019, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said in a non-binding statement that Britain had unlawfully detached the Chagos Islands from Mauritius, before granting the latter independence in 1968. 

The UN has also urged the UK to hand the territory over to Mauritius.

Under the proposed agreement, a resettlement fund would be created to help displaced islanders return to the Chagos Islands. However, specific details of the scheme remain unclear.

Russia appears to be on the cusp of outperforming Ukraine in the use of drones on the battlefield.A recent article by BBC sheds light on the Ukrainian retreat from the battle of Kursk. Ukraine has held this pocket of Russian territory since August 2024. It was one of the few bright spots of last year as Ukraine was hard-pressed by Russia, and its other offensives stalled. Now Moscow has forced Ukrainians out of the Kursk area, who told BBC that Russian drones played a major role.  The BBC article matters because it illustrates a drone learning curve that Russia has pursued since the war began. Russia acquired Iranian Shahed kamikaze drones early in the war in 2022 and used them to target Ukraine. These one-way attack drones were not a game changer.However, Russia's use of them showed how Iranian-backed groups would use the same drones against Israel after the Hamas attack on October 7. That illustrates how what Russia is doing in Kursk may have ramifications for the Middle East. Reports at Conflict Armament Research revealed this month that the Houthis are working with hydrogen fuel cells to power drones.

(credit: REUTERS/IVAN ANTYPENKO/FILE PHOTO)What can we learn from the BBC report about the Kursk route? First of all, it was basic military tactics that mauled Ukraine. The report says Kyiv sent around 12,000 soldiers, some of its best trained, into the fight. Russia sent tens of thousands to cordon off the Ukrainian gains and then attempted to roll back the Ukrainians. The report says that, in the end, Kyiv was relying on one road to supply its salient forces.This is a classic challenge in military terms, and it appears that this road now resembles the Iraqi army's retreat from Kuwait. Basically, Ukrainians have been fleeing at night and leaving behind equipment and vehicles. “Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to ‘take fire control of the main logistics routes.'” The report said. “They included drones linked to operators by fiber-optic wires – which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.”In another part of the report, in which the BBC spoke to Ukrainian soldiers who have been able to get out of the Kursk front via retreating, it appears that Russian FPV drones, or those using a first-person viewer (FPV) flight mode, have been essential.

Now we do not,” a Ukrainian soldier said. “He added that Russia had an advantage with more accurate air strikes and a greater number of troops. We almost died several times.

It uses multiple drones, which the article characterizes as “drone swarms.” In fact, this simply means several drones at a time in areas, using them to monitor and strike. “Multiple drones often hunted vehicles,” the report says.Azerbaijan also used drones to successfully decimate Armenian forces vehicles in battles over Nagorna-Karabakh over the last years.Another soldier said drones targeted their car. They were constantly attacking the single road. “‘Drones around the clock. In one minute, you can see two to three drones.

What can we learn from the BBC report about the Kursk route? First of all, it was basic military tactics that mauled Ukraine. The report says Kyiv sent around 12,000 soldiers, some of its best trained, into the fight. Russia sent tens of thousands to cordon off the Ukrainian gains and then attempted to roll back the Ukrainians. The report says that, in the end, Kyiv was relying on one road to supply its salient forces.This is a classic challenge in military terms, and it appears that this road now resembles the Iraqi army's retreat from Kuwait. Basically, Ukrainians have been fleeing at night and leaving behind equipment and vehicles. “Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and first-person-view (FPV) variants to ‘take fire control of the main logistics routes.'” The report said. “They included drones linked to operators by fiber-optic wires – which are impossible to jam with electronic counter-measures.”In another part of the report, in which the BBC spoke to Ukrainian soldiers who have been able to get out of the Kursk front via retreating, it appears that Russian FPV drones, or those using a first-person viewer (FPV) flight mode, have been essential.

Now we do not,” a Ukrainian soldier said. “He added that Russia had an advantage with more accurate air strikes and a greater number of troops. We almost died several times. Drones are in the sky all the time.” AdvertisementHow did Russia win the drone war in Kursk? It uses multiple drones, which the article characterizes as “drone swarms.” In fact, this simply means several drones at a time in areas, using them to monitor and strike. “Multiple drones often hunted vehicles,” the report says.Azerbaijan also used drones to successfully decimate Armenian forces vehicles in battles over Nagorna-Karabakh over the last years.Another soldier said drones targeted their car. They were constantly attacking the single road. “‘Drones around the clock. In one minute, you can see two to three drones. That's a lot,” a soldier said. “Russia had also sent its best drone units to the front and was using kamikaze and FPV variants to ‘take fire control of the main logistics routes,'” the report noted.

Drones can be jammed or shot down.The rush to acquire drones and drone defenses is part of the current way militaries are changing in the Ukraine war and also in the Middle East.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Sunday that the United States would conduct ""unrelenting"" strikes against the Houthis in Yemen until the terrorist group ceases their military actions targeting US assets and global shipping.

Nita Lowey, a Jewish Democrat from New York who served in the US House of Representatives for 32 years, has died at 87.Lowey's family announced her death on Sunday, four years after she retired from Congress. She had battled breast cancer for several years, the family's announcement said.  “A public servant in the truest sense, she was guided by the Jewish core value of ‘Tikkun Olam,' repairing the world,” said the announcement, which said Lowey died surrounded by family at her Harrison, New York, home.Lowey was 51 in 1988 when she was elected to Congress to represent a suburban district encompassing parts of Westchester County as well as Rockland County, with a large Jewish population. She became the first woman to head the House Appropriations Committee. She was also a staunch advocate for Israel and battled against eroding bipartisan support for the country. Advertisement THE US CAPITOL BUILDING in Washington: The first order of business should be the old business which Congress failed to finish last year; Congress and the Trump administration need to be more aggressive in addressing antisemitism, states the writer. (credit: PIROSCHKA VAN DE WOUW/REUTERS)When Rep. Ilhan Omar, elected in 2018 as a member of the progressive “Squad,” suggested that supporters of Israel are loyal to a foreign country, Lowey condemned her statements.She also pleaded in vain with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2015 not to accept an invitation from the Republican speaker of the House that would enable him to use Congress as a stage to slam President Barack Obama's efforts to negotiate a deal to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions — though she opposed the deal herself. “I said, ‘I'll arrange private meetings for you in the House and Senate. This was not a bipartisan invitation, and I believe passionately for Israel and the US to maintain a bipartisan alliance. Don't come within a framework that has been partisan,'” Lowey recalled in 2019. “He said, ‘I'll think about it.' He never got back to me.”And Lowey also lobbied a diverse array of groups — from the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC to J Street, the liberal Israel lobby, to the Alliance for Middle East Peace — to get them to back a bill that would budget $50 million to support grassroots peace programs. When the bill became law after her retirement, with bipartisan support and a budget five times that amount, its official name was the Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The American Jewish Committee said in a statement about Lowey's death that the act, “a transformative law, continues to be central to AJC's advocacy as we work to build trust and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, and strive for a more peaceful and interconnected Middle East.” AdvertisementThe AJC's CEO, Ted Deutch, was Lowey's colleague in Congress. “She was an incredible mentor, and I am so fortunate to have witnessed her at work on the House floor, at home, and around the world,” Deutch said in a statement. He added, “Nita loved AJC and the Jewish people, and I hope through our collective efforts, we, too, can help honor her memory.”Lowey's lifeLowey was born in 1937 in the Bronx, where her mother was involved in the local synagogue and other Jewish causes. After graduating from the Bronx High School of Science, she headed to Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, where her own Jewish identity was activated when she found that there were religious services for Christians but not for Jewish students.“I organized Friday night services for 15 women, and although back in the Bronx I didn't go to Friday night services, I organized Friday night services and I thought that was important,” she recalled.  Returning to New York after graduation, she married and had three children before entering politics in her 30s as an assistant to Gov. Mario Cuomo. She had risen to become assistant secretary of state in 1988 when she defeated a Republican incumbent to enter Congress. She then represented her district for more than three decades — opting to remain in Congress rather than vie for Hillary Clinton's Senate seat in 2009 when many thought she would be a shoo-in.Lowey announced her retirement shortly after Mondaire Jones, a young progressive, announced a primary challenge against her in 2019. “I am so glad we got to spend time together over the past few years,” Jones, who was succeeded by incumbent Republican Rep. Mike Lawler, said in a statement on Sunday. “And I am proud to know firsthand through my travels that her impact is felt not only in New York but around the world.”Lowey is survived by her husband, who is 64 years old; the attorney, Steve Lowey; and three children and eight grandchildren.Upon her retirement, Lowey said she felt no conflict between loving Israel and criticizing its government. She also recalled with pride taking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to Israel in the 1990s to learn about Israeli efforts to assist developing African countries. The country's medical and science innovations, she said, “make me so proud to be a Jew, as a Jewish member of Congress having the opportunity to work for peace, work for good relationships between Arabs and Jews. It's been a privilege.”

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The American Jewish Committee said in a statement about Lowey's death that the act, “a transformative law, continues to be central to AJC's advocacy as we work to build trust and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians, and strive for a more peaceful and interconnected Middle East.” AdvertisementThe AJC's CEO, Ted Deutch, was Lowey's colleague in Congress. “She was an incredible mentor, and I am so fortunate to have witnessed her at work on the House floor, at home, and around the world,” Deutch said in a statement. He added, “Nita loved AJC and the Jewish people, and I hope through our collective efforts, we, too, can help honor her memory.”Lowey's lifeLowey was born in 1937 in the Bronx, where her mother was involved in the local synagogue and other Jewish causes. After graduating from the Bronx High School of Science, she headed to Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, where her own Jewish identity was activated when she found that there were religious services for Christians but not for Jewish students.“I organized Friday night services for 15 women, and although back in the Bronx I didn't go to Friday night services, I organized Friday night services and I thought that was important,” she recalled.  Returning to New York after graduation, she married and had three children before entering politics in her 30s as an assistant to Gov. Mario Cuomo. She had risen to become assistant secretary of state in 1988 when she defeated a Republican incumbent to enter Congress. She then represented her district for more than three decades — opting to remain in Congress rather than vie for Hillary Clinton's Senate seat in 2009 when many thought she would be a shoo-in.Lowey announced her retirement shortly after Mondaire Jones, a young progressive, announced a primary challenge against her in 2019. “I am so glad we got to spend time together over the past few years,” Jones, who was succeeded by incumbent Republican Rep. Mike Lawler, said in a statement on Sunday. “And I am proud to know firsthand through my travels that her impact is felt not only in New York but around the world.”Lowey is survived by her husband, who is 64 years old; the attorney, Steve Lowey; and three children and eight grandchildren.Upon her retirement, Lowey said she felt no conflict between loving Israel and criticizing its government. She also recalled with pride taking members of the Congressional Black Caucus to Israel in the 1990s to learn about Israeli efforts to assist developing African countries. The country's medical and science innovations, she said, “make me so proud to be a Jew, as a Jewish member of Congress having the opportunity to work for peace, work for good relationships between Arabs and Jews. It's been a privilege.”
            



“I said, ‘I'll arrange private meetings for you in the House and Senate. This was not a bipartisan invitation, and I believe passionately for Israel and the US to maintain a bipartisan alliance. Don't come within a framework that has been partisan,'” Lowey recalled in 2019. “He said, ‘I'll think about it.' He never got back to me.”And Lowey also lobbied a diverse array of groups — from the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC to J Street, the liberal Israel lobby, to the Alliance for Middle East Peace — to get them to back a bill that would budget $50 million to support grassroots peace programs.

Syrian troops exchanged fire with Lebanese soldiers and armed groups in northeast Lebanon overnight and into Monday in a new round of clashes along the border.There have been frictions along the mountainous frontier in the months since Islamist rebels toppled Syria's Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Tehran and Iran-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, and installed their own institutions and army.Late on Sunday, Syria's defense ministry accused Hezbollah of crossing into Syrian territory and kidnapping and killing three members of Syria's new army.  Hezbollah denied any involvement. A Lebanese security source told Reuters the three Syrian soldiers had crossed into Lebanese territory first and were killed by armed members of a tribe in northeastern Lebanon who feared their town was under attack.In retaliation for their deaths, Syrian troops shelled Lebanese border towns overnight, according to the Syrian defense ministry and the Lebanese army. Residents of the town of Al-Qasr, less than one kilometer from the border, told Reuters they fled further inland to escape the bombardment.

Syria's army sent a convoy of troops and several tanks to the frontier on Monday, according to a Reuters reporter along the border.

US Central Command put out a video overnight between March 16 and 17 showing continued attacks on the Houthis in Yemen.America began delivering strikes over the weekend and is now stepping them up. The goal is to prevent the Houthis from attacking ships in the Red Sea.The Yemen-based terrorist group claimed to target a US aircraft carrier and other ships with missiles. The Houthis clearly intend to continue attacks; therefore, America is also continuing strikes.  The Houthis claimed overnight that there were attacks against the city of Hodeidah on the coast. It should be recalled that Israel also struck the coastal city in response to months of Houthi attacks. The attacks on Hodeidah did not deter them in the past.Washington had downplayed Houthi threats of retaliation and US officials say they are ready to keep up the pressure. A ship fires missiles at an undisclosed location, after U.S. President Donald Trump launched military strikes against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis on Saturday over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping, in this screengrab obtained from a handout video released on March 15, 2025.  (credit: US CENTRAL COMMAND/HANDOUT VIA REUTERS)According to Al-Ain media in the UAE, which relied on reports from Yemen, two strikes took place Monday in Hodeidah. The same report said the US strikes have targeted “Houthi bases, command centers, and missile defense sites to protect US shipping in the region and restore freedom of navigation.”The report notes that the Houthis have said they will resume attacks on ships this week. “On Sunday and Monday, the Houthis in Yemen claimed responsibility for two attacks against a US aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, asserting that they would also target US cargo ships. This was in retaliation for US strikes on Yemen that killed 53 people, according to the Houthi health ministry,” the report said. Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi called on his supporters to take to the streets on Monday. The US has threatened to hold Iran responsible for the Houthis acts.Tehran has distanced itself from the Houthis. US officials have been speaking on various media to explain the attacks. It is clear that this is a broad and deep policy of the Trump administration, which expects success here.US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said over the weekend that “I want to be very clear: this campaign is about freedom of navigation and restoring deterrence.” Freedom of navigation has been a US policy for more than 100 years. It was a key element of president Woodrow Wilson's fourteen points at the end of the First World War.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  An asymmetric type of warThe war on the coast of Yemen is a complex and asymmetric type of war. The US has tremendous naval assets in the region, while the Houthis have ballistic missiles and drones.For instance, they have already claimed to target a US carrier using up to 18 ballistic missiles and a drone. Iran Ellis Jones, who tracks American naval activity and actions in the region, put out an important post on X/Twitter illustrating the naval assets the US has in the region.Off the coast of Yemen, his post indicates, is the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman accompanied by the USS Gettysburg Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser, USS The Sullivans Fletcher-class destroyer, and the Aegis guided missile destroyers USS Stout and USS Jason Dunham, the latest of the three destroyers to put to sea, having been commissioned in 2010. The USNS Arctic supply-class fast combat support ship is also with the carrier group. All of this provides the US with serious firepower to deal with the Houthis. However, the question will remain, as time goes on, whether this is enough.The Truman has a new commander as well. Its former commander, Capt. Dave Snowden, was removed in February after a collision with a merchant ship off the coast of Egypt, USNI reported. He was replaced by Capt. Christophe “Chowdah” Hill.

Tehran has distanced itself from the Houthis. US officials have been speaking on various media to explain the attacks. It is clear that this is a broad and deep policy of the Trump administration, which expects success here.US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said over the weekend that “I want to be very clear: this campaign is about freedom of navigation and restoring deterrence.” Freedom of navigation has been a US policy for more than 100 years.

Egypt is currently playing a crucial role in two of the most significant efforts related to the Gaza conflict.As a mediator, along with the US and Qatar, of the arms-length discussions between Israel and Hamas, Egypt has hosted many rounds of ceasefire and prisoner exchange negotiations. Now, strengthened by its central role in the ceasefire talks, it has masterminded a detailed $53 billion reconstruction initiative for Gaza, which has received strong backing from Arab nations, Western governments, and the UN.   It has provided a credible alternative to President Donald Trump's “Riviera of the Mediterranean” concept, which proposed the displacement of most of Gaza's Palestinian population into neighboring Arab states.In late 2023, Egypt did allow the immigration into Egypt, via the Rafah crossing, of a limited number of foreign nationals, dual citizens, and wounded Palestinians. Subsequently, however, it has strongly opposed extending this program, holding firmly to the belief that Gazan citizens should not be displaced from their homeland.  AdvertisementEarly in February, Israel accused Egypt of expanding its military presence near the border, perhaps to guard against an influx of refugees from Gaza. Egypt said its soldiers were there to fight extremists, who are certainly active in the Sinai peninsula. Egyptian FM Badr Abdelatty (R) and PA PM Mohammad Mustafa (L) at a joint press conference in Cairo, March 1, 2025. (credit: SCREENSHOT/FACEBOOK/VIA SECTION 27A OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT)Total rejection of the idea of displacing large numbers of Gazan citizens lies at the heart of Egypt's proposals for post-war Gaza. Egypt is shaping the region's response to the crisis and positioning itself at the forefront of regional diplomacy, making it a central actor in shaping the future of Gaza and broader Middle East stability. Egypt's initiative would carry real conviction if it emanated from an economically flourishing nation-state, but Egypt is not flying high on the domestic front. It is one of the world's most indebted emerging markets. It is a major burden to service its debts, especially to the International Monetary Fund and Gulf states arising from previous financial rescue packages.As a condition of accepting these loans, Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, was obliged to restrict public spending and impose heavier taxes. This resulted in soaring inflation and the persistent depreciation of Egypt's currency. This, at least, Sisi has been attempting, with some success, to remedy.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Egypt's economyEgypt's annual inflation rate in 2020 was about 5.4%. By 2023, it had surged to some 34%, and in September 2024 it peaked at 38%, plunging large parts of the population into severe poverty. Since then, it has been brought under control, and is now declining. AdvertisementA Reuters poll projects that the inflation rate in February will have fallen to 14.5% – much too high for comfort but on the correct trajectory.As for the Egyptian pound, in 2022 its trading rate was about E£16 to the dollar. In 2023, it traded at around E£31. By the end of 2024, the Egyptian pound had devalued to E£50.64 per US dollar.Sisi, however, is succeeding in reversing the downward economic spiral. As of March 2025, Egypt's economic indicators show definite signs of improvement. Its GDP growth rate was recorded at 3.5% in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024/2025, reflecting the positive impact of economic reform policies.   Looking ahead, the ratings organization Moody's Analytics forecasts a 5% growth for Egypt's economy by the fiscal year 2025/2026, with average inflation expected to fall to 16% in the next fiscal year, before further decreasing to 13% by 2026.Sisi's political standing at home, at a particularly low ebb during the worst of the economic hardship, has not yet shown much sign of improvement. Egypt's enhanced international standing, following acceptance by the Arab world and the UN of its plan for Gaza's future, may start to turn the popularity ratings in Sisi's favor.Vision 2030What could effect a sea change in both Sisi's and Egypt's standing would be if its economic development program, Egypt's Vision 2030, achieves some of its goals in the next five years.Saudi Vision 2030, the ambitious program to revolutionize Saudi Arabia economically and socially, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has received a fair degree of publicity. Egypt's Vision 2030, about which much less has appeared in the media, is no pale copy. On the contrary, it was launched in February 2016, two months before bin Salman announced his plan for Saudi Arabia.Egypt's Vision 2030 is a long-term economic development program aimed at achieving sustainable growth and improving the country's global competitiveness. It focuses on key areas such as economic diversification, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability.The plan aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and aims to position Egypt as a leading economy in the region by enhancing investment and digital transformation.Despite Egypt's economic difficulties in recent years, the program has achieved a degree of success. With a population of 115 million, Egypt has been capitalizing on its skilled workforce, prime location, and rich resources to strengthen its position as a key economic hub within Africa.A key component of Vision 2030 is the Digital Egypt strategy, focusing on fostering artificial intelligence and digital innovation. In 2024, Egypt's tech sector recorded a 16.8% year-on-year growth. Central to the program is Egypt's construction sector, growing at an annual rate of 7.4%. Vision 2030 has driven several ambitious projects, including New Alamein City, the high-speed rail and urban railway networks, critical seaport and road infrastructure, and the $45 billion New Administrative Capital. This massive urban development project, intended to house some 6.5 million people eventually, is designed to ease congestion in Cairo and serve as the country's new government and financial hub. Estimated to cost over $58 billion, it was started in 2015. Government offices began to relocate there in 2024, while the designated business district, which contains Africa's tallest skyscraper, the Iconic Tower, is growing rapidly. A new rail and monorail system connects it to Cairo, and an international airport is under construction.Vision 2030 envisages 42% of Egypt's energy coming from renewable sources by 2030. By prioritizing wind, solar, and green hydrogen production, the country is expanding its renewable capacity to 45,000 megawatts from projects already under construction.In 2024, Egypt attracted 15.7 million tourists, breaking its record for the second consecutive year. Tourism and Antiquities Minister Sherif Fathy projects that Egypt is on track to reach 30 million tourists by 2030.With its multi-million development program showing every sign of succeeding, Egypt is particularly well-placed to mastermind an international effort to reconstruct Gaza.

As for the Egyptian pound, in 2022 its trading rate was about E£16 to the dollar. In 2023, it traded at around E£31. By the end of 2024, the Egyptian pound had devalued to E£50.64 per US dollar.Sisi, however, is succeeding in reversing the downward economic spiral. As of March 2025, Egypt's economic indicators show definite signs of improvement. Its GDP growth rate was recorded at 3.5% in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024/2025, reflecting the positive impact of economic reform policies.   Looking ahead, the ratings organization Moody's Analytics forecasts a 5% growth for Egypt's economy by the fiscal year 2025/2026, with average inflation expected to fall to 16% in the next fiscal year, before further decreasing to 13% by 2026.Sisi's political standing at home, at a particularly low ebb during the worst of the economic hardship, has not yet shown much sign of improvement. Egypt's enhanced international standing, following acceptance by the Arab world and the UN of its plan for Gaza's future, may start to turn the popularity ratings in Sisi's favor.Vision 2030What could effect a sea change in both Sisi's and Egypt's standing would be if its economic development program, Egypt's Vision 2030, achieves some of its goals in the next five years.Saudi Vision 2030, the ambitious program to revolutionize Saudi Arabia economically and socially, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has received a fair degree of publicity. Egypt's Vision 2030, about which much less has appeared in the media, is no pale copy. On the contrary, it was launched in February 2016, two months before bin Salman announced his plan for Saudi Arabia.Egypt's Vision 2030 is a long-term economic development program aimed at achieving sustainable growth and improving the country's global competitiveness. It focuses on key areas such as economic diversification, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability.The plan aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and aims to position Egypt as a leading economy in the region by enhancing investment and digital transformation.Despite Egypt's economic difficulties in recent years, the program has achieved a degree of success. With a population of 115 million, Egypt has been capitalizing on its skilled workforce, prime location, and rich resources to strengthen its position as a key economic hub within Africa.A key component of Vision 2030 is the Digital Egypt strategy, focusing on fostering artificial intelligence and digital innovation. In 2024, Egypt's tech sector recorded a 16.8% year-on-year growth. Central to the program is Egypt's construction sector, growing at an annual rate of 7.4%.

Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence of the United States who is in India for an official trip, dwelled on the tariff threat on Monday, saying India and the Donald Trump-led country have established a direct dialogue at the very top over the issue.

Speaking to ANI on the sidelines of the think tank Observer Research Foundation's annual Raisina Dialogues in the capital, Tulsi Gabbard said there was an opportunity to strengthen the economic relationship between India and the US.

""What I have heard from the Indian government officials that I've spoken to over the last few days, there is an opportunity here to see. There is more potential for strengthening our economic relationship and I'm glad to see that they're looking at it in a more positive light than just one that is focused in a negative way when we look at tariffs. Prime Minister Modi is looking out for what is in the best interest of India's economy and the opportunities available to the people of India. Similarly, President Trump is doing the same for the United States, our economic interests and the interests of the American people, "" she added.

The US Director of National Intelligence said that both President Trump and PM Modi are looking for a ""good solution"".

""What I see as a great positive is that we have two leaders who have common sense and who are looking for good solutions. This direct dialogue is happening at the very top in both of our countries, but also at the different secretaries and the cabinet members is going to be key to laying down what that path forward really looks like. And I am excited because there's keen interest in the private sector here in India and in the United States,"" she said.

She said that she draws her strength and guidance from Lord Krishna's teachings to Arjuna during the Mahabharata in times of personal and professional turmoil.

""Whether serving in war zones in different parts of the world or the challenges that we face now, it is (Lord) Krishna's teachings to Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita that I turn to in the best of times and the worst of times,"" Gabbard said.

Gabbard arrived in the national capital early Sunday on a two-and-a-half-day trip.

Earlier in the day, defence minister Rajnath Singh and the US Director of National Intelligence held wide-ranging talks focusing on enhancing the overall India-US strategic ties, especially in areas of defence and information sharing.

In a social media post, Singh said he was ""happy"" to meet the US national intelligence chief and that they discussed ways to further deepen the India-US partnership.

""We discussed a wide range of issues which include defence and information sharing, aiming to further deepen the India-US partnership,"" he said.

On Sunday, Gabbard also met with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, and they discussed several facets of the Indo-US relationship in detail.

An Indian historian, who has lived in UK for over a decade, is facing deportation after the Home Office ruled she had exceeded the permitted number of days abroad while conducting research in India, according to a report in The Guardian.

Dr Manikarnika Dutta, 37, who has worked at prestigious UK institutions including the University of Oxford and the University of Bristol, has been denied indefinite leave to remain (ILR) due to her time spent outside the UK fulfilling academic obligations. Despite her work being integral to her field, the Home Office has ordered her to leave the country.

Dutta moved to the UK in 2012 to pursue a Master's degree at the University of Oxford, later securing a spouse visa as the dependent of her husband, Souvik Naha, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow.

Under UK immigration rules, applicants for ILR based on long residency must not have spent more than 548 days abroad over a ten-year period.

Dutta, whose research required access to historical archives in India, was away for 691 days.

“These research trips were not optional but essential to fulfilling her academic and institutional obligations,” Naga Kandiah, her legal representative at MTC Solicitors told The Guardian. “Had she not undertaken these trips, she would not have been able to complete her thesis or meet the academic requirements of her institutions.”

Despite her husband's ILR application being approved, Dutta's was rejected. The Home Office's decision was upheld in an administrative review, which concluded: “You must now leave the United Kingdom. If you don't leave voluntarily, you may be subject to a re-entry ban of 10 years and prosecuted for overstaying.”

“I was shocked when I got an email saying I have to leave,” Dutta told The Observer. “I have been employed at different universities in the UK and I've lived here for 12 years. A large part of my adult life has been spent here since I came to Oxford for my master's. I never thought something like this would happen to me.”

Her husband, Naha, expressed the emotional toll of the decision. “This has been terribly stressful for both of us. I sometimes give lectures about these issues and have read articles about people affected, but never thought it would happen to us.”

Indian student Ranjani Srinivasan left the United States for Canada after the Donald Trump administration revoked her student visa on allegations of being a ‘terrorist sympathiser'. In her first public remarks after the ‘self-deportation', she revealed the reason for her leaving the country.

In an interview with the New York Times, the 37-year-old said she made a quick decision to leave New York to fly to Canada as the atmosphere was ‘dangerous'.

“The atmosphere seemed so volatile and dangerous. So I just made a quick decision,” she said in the interview.

Srinivasan was a PhD scholar at Columbia University, pursuing her doctorate in urban planning. Before this, she got her master's degree from Harvard on a Fullbright scholarship.

“I'm fearful that even the most low-level political speech or just doing what we all do — like shout into the abyss that is social media — can turn into this dystopian nightmare where somebody is calling you a terrorist sympathizer and making you, literally, fear for your life and your safety,” she added in the interview.

Federal agents showed up at her door at the University campus more than a week ago on a Friday morning looking for her. They returned on Saturday after she did not open the door the first time. She took a flight out of LaGuardia Airport before the agents came looking for her again last Thursday.

Ranjani Srinivasan first learned of her visa cancellation on March 5, when she received an email from the US Consulate in Chennai. The email cited “information that has come to light,” but without further explanation. Confused and unsure, she reached out to Columbia's international student office for guidance.

Srinivasan said that soon after her student visa was revoked, the university withdrew her enrollment because her legal status had been terminated. The situation escalated after the Department of Homeland Security accused Srinivasan of supporting Hamas, a claim for which no evidence was provided.

In response to the allegations, Srinivasan's legal team rejected the accusations, calling them part of a broader crackdown on political speech.

Srinivasan was arrested at the varsity entrance on a day when pro-Palestinian protesters had occupied Hamilton Hall, a building on campus last year. She argued she was not actively part of the crowd but was only trying to return home after a picnic with friends when she got caught in the crowd. The case was later dismissed.

After Srinivasan fled, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem shared surveillance footage of her departure, labeling them a “terrorist sympathizer” and celebrating her flight as a “self-deportation.”

The United States has escalated its strikes against Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis, with President Donald Trump vowing on Saturday to use ‘overwhelming lethal force' against the rebels who have attacked international ships in the Red Sea in ‘solidarity' with Gaza.

Multiple US strikes in Yemen's capital Sanaa and other areas have resulted in numerous casualties with the militants also vowing escalation as they face one of the most extensive attacks since the war in Gaza began in October 2023. Here is the conflict in 10 points.

US federal government employees who were forced to return to work full-time from their offices by President Donald Trump on January 20, described chaotic workplace conditions in government buildings as they returned after years.

Donald Trump's back-to-office order was part of efforts to reshape and reorient the 2.3 million strong federal workforce as the administration seeks to cut “wasteful expenditure” and improve “efficiency” with the help of billionaire Elon Musk, the head of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

According to Trump administration figures, more than 100,000 workers have left their jobs or opted for compensation packages after Musk-led DOGE began its purge. More large-scale cuts are under way, Reuters reported.

Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been working remotely since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. 10 employees from eight different governmental agencies spoke anonymously to news agency Reuters and explained how their office buildings were incapable to house the returning employees.

About 1.1 million federal workers were eligible for remote work and about 228,000 of them had been fully remote, according to a report issued by the Office of Management and Budget in August last year.

At NASA headquarter in Washington, employees who returned to office last month found workplaces infested with cockroaches, bugs coming out of faucets and had to work from chairs with no desks.

Matt Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers that represents 8,000 federal NASA workers said, “It's complete chaos at NASA headquarters. If you don't have a desk or a computer you cannot do your job. People are much more unproductive.”

Employees returning to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland are arriving before dawn and sleeping in their vehicles in worry of getting stuck in traffic. Biggs told Reuters that some employees prefer to attend meetings inside their cars using smartphone hotspot as the workplace has become noisy.

Employees at the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) compared their search for office desk in some regional offices to “The Hunger Games”, where young people are forced to fight to the death in a government-sanctioned contest.

An employee at the USCIS office in Chicago said they were forced to work from boxes in a storage room temporarily.

At the Department of Agriculture's headquarters in Washington, staff are reportedly fighting for office space while workers are busy reorienting the premises to create temporary workstations. A staff members said that workers returned to bathrooms with no paper towels. “It's a zoo,” he said.

An Internal Revenue Service (IRS) manager told Reuters that employees at IRS office in Memphis, Tennessee, are unable to discuss sensitive tax matters with clients over the phone as it could potentially breach the country's privacy laws.

Another IRS manager said that she was sitting on a floor with her laptop as the office lacks enough desks. An IRS human resource official said that she was asked to work from a supply closet.

The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has informed that it cannot guarantee desks or parking spots for the roughly 18,000 employees expected to report to their offices on Monday.

Critics and labour unions alleged that the back-to-office order was intended to make the work environment so unpleasant that it will force more government employees to resign.

Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 government workers said, “Bringing people back to work was nothing but a ploy to cause more confusion and get people to quit.”

Pam Herd, a professor of social policy at the University of Michigan, said, “It's the move fast and break things approach, without really thinking through the implications of a range of different choices you are making.”

“So they tell everyone to return to work without considering the fact that they don't have the space to accommodate everyone,” he added.

The Office of Personnel Management spokesperson, the government's human resources department, said the January 20 order's goal was to ensure that federal employees work efficiently to best serve the American people.

“We are prioritizing in-person work to strengthen collaboration, accountability, and service delivery across the federal workforce,” the spokesperson added.

A White House official told Reuters that facilities staff at the General Services Administration are working “tirelessly to address reported issues to a satisfactory outcome.”

Boston Bruins general manager Don Sweeney has been accused of “threatening” his players before the NHL 2024-25 trade deadline. A source told RG.org that Sweeney gathered the team's core players after firing former head coach Jim Montgomery in November and told them they needed to improve or risk being traded. However, despite the warning, the Bruins struggled, posting a 3-6-2 record from February 1 until the NHL Trade Deadline on March 7. In a surprising move, Sweeney traded away Brad Marchand, Charlie Coyle, Brandon Carlo, and forwards Justin Brazeau and Marc McLaughlin.

“Don told the core back in November and again before the Four Nations: ‘If you don't get this together, changes are coming for you!' and clearly he held true to his word,” a source close to the situation told RG.org.

“They all knew this was coming if they didn't start winning more and find consistency. He made it clear that he would do something exactly like this. He met with the leadership core and coaching staff after they fired ‘Monty' [Jim Montgomery] and again right before the break.”

In an interview with RG.org, Marchand reflected on the changes.

“Anytime you don't achieve what you're expected to or what you set out to do, they're going to make changes. I mean, ultimately, changes come when you're doing well too, but whether you're going to add or subtract, changes need to be made. Unfortunately, when it's not going the way you want it to, the changes are going to be bigger. So, yeah, I think we saw the potential for the changes that were going to come,"" Marchand said.

“We talked about it; we tried to stop it, and we just couldn't,” Marchand added. “It just seemed like every time we tried to do the right things and change course, it wouldn't come together for us. Unfortunately, sometimes, things like that happen, and you try to control it, you try to do whatever you can, and it just seems like everything that could go against us, would go against us. I mean, look at the goal in Carolina (a last-second 3-2 loss on March 6), you can't plan for that stuff. You feel like you're trying to do the right thing, and everything that could go wrong at that moment goes wrong.""

Bruins analyst Mike Grinnell criticized Sweeney for trading Brad Marchand at the deadline, calling the move a major misstep.

“If the Bruins at the deadline signed Brad Marchand, and they went and traded for Brock Nelson and made additions then, yeah, put on the gas pedal. Let's go win this thing. I didn't make this decision. Don Sweeney made the decision to throw in the towel. And any m***n out there that says the Bruins are better without Brad Marchand, go f**k yourself,” he said, Bruins insider reported.

With curiosity building over the return of a pair of US astronauts stuck for more than nine months on the International Space Station (ISS), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on Sunday confirmed that the duo will return to Earth on Tuesday, March 18, evening (GMT).

Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams are to be transported home with another American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon craft, which arrived at the ISS early Sunday.

The duo has been on the ISS since June last year after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed journey was hit by propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.

 

NASA said in a statement on Sunday evening that it had moved forward the astronauts' anticipated ocean splashdown off the Florida coast to approximately 5:57 pm Tuesday, Florida time, (3:27 am IST, March 19). It was initially slated for no sooner than Wednesday.

""The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favorable weather conditions expected for later in the week,"" the space agency said.

NASA said in a statement that it will provide live coverage of the agency's SpaceX Crew-9 return to Earth from the ISS, beginning with Dragon spacecraft hatch closure preparations at 10:45 pm EDT Monday, March 17 (around 8:30 am on March 18 in India).

NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will also return on the Dragon capsule. The slated journey will mark the end of an ordeal for Wilmore and Williams that has seen them stuck for nine months after what was meant to have been a days-long roundtrip.

 

While the extended stay of Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams aboard the ISS was much longer than the typical six-month rotation for astronauts, it falls short of the US space record of 371 days set by NASA astronaut Frank Rubio in 2023, or the world record of 437 days held by Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov aboard the Mir space station.

The unexpected length of their time away from their families had drawn massive attention, speculation and concerns. Due to the unforeseen extension, both the astronauts had to receive extra clothing and personal care supplies, as they hadn't packed enough for such an extended mission.

President Donald Trump on Monday declared all the pardons issued by his predecessor Joe Biden as void, claiming that they had been executed without Biden's approval.

Trump said the pardons were signed using an autopen - a device that replicates a person's signature - implying that Biden neither personally signed nor was aware of these pardons. He further suggested that those who facilitated these actions without Biden's consent might have committed a crime.

""The “Pardons” that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

""The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden. He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime. Therefore, those on the Unselect Committee, who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me, and many other innocent people, should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level. The fact is, they were probably responsible for the Documents that were signed on their behalf without the knowledge or consent of the Worst President in the History of our Country, Crooked Joe Biden,"" he added.

 

Who had Biden pardoned?In his final hours in office, Biden issued a series of preemptive pardons to several individuals, including his family members - brothers James and Francis Biden, sister Valerie Biden Owens, and their spouses. Biden stated that his family had been ""subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me - the worst kind of partisan politics."" Additionally, Biden granted pardons to prominent figures such as Dr Anthony Fauci, former Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; retired General Mark Milley, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and members of the House committee that investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol. These preemptive pardons were intended to protect individuals from potential politically motivated prosecutions by the incoming administration. What is an autopen?Trump's assertion that the use of an autopen invalidates these pardons is unprecedented. The autopen has been employed by presidents for decades to sign various documents, including legislation and executive orders, when they are unavailable to sign personally. Legal experts have generally upheld the validity of such signatures. However, the specific application of the autopen for presidential pardons has not been extensively tested in courts, leaving room for legal debate.

New footage shows missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki and Joshua Riibe, the person of interest, at an outdoor bar before she vanished from a Punta Cana beach. The videos were obtained by local outlet Noticia SIN. Konanki and Riibe do not interact in the videos.

One of the clips shows Konanki, 20, hanging at a resort bar with friends, near a struggling man who appears to be Riibe. In one of the clips, Konanki and her friends are seen at the bar before the Pitt student puts her hand to her mouth and quickly excuses herself. She then hunches over a patch of grass just a few feet away.

The local outlet identified the woman putting her hand to her mouth as Konanki. She then walks back to the bar, appears to jump up and down in excitement, and then hugs one of her female friends.

Meanwhile, a man believed to be Riibe is seen bent over and struggling outside the bar, with another young man appearing to comfort him. Riibe, who is seen stumbling backward at one point, seems to be wearing the same clothes he was seen in in previously released surveillance footage of him and Konanki walking together, arm-in-arm, before she went missing.

In the newly-released video, Riibe and Konanki do not interact. They appear to be visiting the bar in separate groups.

A second video shows Konanki, along with three other girls, in the lobby of the RIU Hotel & Resort.

Riibe was reportedly interrogated by Dominican Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso and Navy Vice Admiral Agustin Morillo Rodriguez until nearly 3 am on Sunday, March 16. An Iowa native and a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, he has reportedly been “in custody” since shortly after Konanki vanished. Although he is considered a person of interest, he has not been charged or accused of wrongdoing. Authorities in the Dominican Republic have confiscated Riibe's passport.

President Donald Trump's administration on Sunday began mass layoffs at Voice of America and other US-funded media, making clear its intent to gut outlets long seen as critical for US influence.

Just a day after all employees were put on leave, staff working on a contractual basis received an email notifying them that they were terminated at the end of March.

The email, confirmed to AFP by several employees, told contractors that ""you must cease all work immediately and are not permitted to access any agency buildings or systems.""

Contractors make up much of VOA's workforce and dominate staffing in the non-English language services, although recent figures were not immediately available.

Many contractors are not US citizens, meaning they likely depend on their soon-to-disappear jobs for visas to stay in the United States.

Most full-time VOA staff, who have more legal protections, were not immediately terminated but remain on administrative leave and have been told not to work.

Voice of America, created during World War II, broadcast around the world in 49 languages with a mission to reach countries without media freedom.

Liam Scott, a VOA reporter who covers press freedom and disinformation, said he was notified that he also reported that he was being dismissed as of March 31.

The Trump administration's destruction of VOA and sister outlets ""are part of its efforts to dismantle the government more broadly -- but it's also part of the administration's broader assault on press freedom and the media,"" he wrote on X.

""I've covered press freedom for a long time, and I've never seen something like what's happened in the US over the past couple of months.""

With VOA in limbo, some of its services have switched to playing music for lack of new programming.

Trump signed an executive order Friday targeting VOA's parent US Agency for Global Media in his latest sweeping cuts to the federal government.

The agency had 3,384 employees in the 2023 fiscal year. It had requested $950 million for the current fiscal year.

The sweeping cuts also froze Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, formed in the Cold War to reach the former Soviet bloc, and Radio Free Asia, established to provide reporting to China, North Korea and other Asian countries with heavily restricted media.

Other US-funded outlets being gutted include Radio Farda, a Persian-language broadcaster blocked by Iran's government, and Alhurra, an Arabic-language network established after the Iraq invasion in the face of highly critical coverage by Qatar-based Al-Jazeera.

The White House said in a statement Saturday that ""taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda,"" a charge rarely leveled before Trump at the staid VOA, long aimed at countering communism.

Trump regularly criticizes media coverage of him and has questioned the wisdom of funding VOA when it has a ""firewall"" ensuring its editorial independence.

Trump, with the advice of tech billionaire Elon Musk, has vowed to drastically reduce the size of government to make way for tax cuts. His administration has already ended the vast majority of foreign development assistance and moved to eviscerate the Education Department.

The moves come as China and Russia invest heavily in state media to compete with Western narratives, with China often offering free content to outlets in the developing world.

In an editorial on the demise of VOA, China's state-run Global Times said that ""the monopoly of information held by some traditional Western media is being shattered.""

""As more Americans begin to break through their information cocoons and see a real world and a multidimensional China, the demonizing narratives propagated by VOA will ultimately become a laughingstock of the times,"" it said.

A 3.9 magnitude earthquake struck near Malibu, California, on Sunday night. Tremors were felt across Los Angeles, Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Ventura, Agoura Hills, and Westlake Village. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the quake hit 10 kilometers northwest of Malibu at 11:17 p.m. at a depth of 14 kilometers. There were no immediate reports of damage.

 

Volcano Discovery, a site that tracks earthquakes, received multiple reports of shaking.

A Brea resident reported, “Sitting in my chair reading, felt a very gentle vibration, very small jiggle.”

A Camarillo resident added, “I felt like I had to wait for it to pass but the intensity seemed to increase for just one brief moment. I don't know if it was my fear of the unknown kicking in or what? I have been in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and it was very scary. This was a lot of swaying back and forth. The unknown possibility of real disaster striking.”

“Wild! Glad it was only a few seconds,” one person wrote.

Another wrote, “Earthquake in LA! We've had enough, Mother Nature! Please give us a chance to regroup.”

A third resident added, “LA has had an earthquake every Sunday for the past 3 weeks…I'm concerned.”

US Intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard, who is on an official visit to India, reiterated President Donald Trump's unwavering commitment to defeating the threat of Islamist terrorism, which she termed as a direct and ongoing danger to the American people.

Gabbard underscored that Prime Minister Narendra Modi also takes the threat of terrorism seriously, emphasising that both nations are dedicated to addressing this persistent threat together.

In an interview with ANI, Gabbard discussed how terrorism impacts not only the US but also India, Bangladesh, Syria, Israel and different parts of the Middle East.

“President Trump, through his first administration in the presidency, and it continues now, has been very clear about his commitment to defeating this threat of Islamist terrorism that has unfortunately plagued us, and continues to pose a direct threat to the American people.”

So this is a threat that I know Prime Minister Modi also takes seriously and one where the leaders of our two countries will work together to try to identify and defeat that threat,"" she added.

Gabbard, who is the Director of National Intelligence in the United States, expressed her commitment to ensuring that the US intelligence community is focused on its core mission of securing the nation, seeking out the truth and reporting the truth so that US President Donald Trump can make the best informed decisions.

""So, in my role as Director of National Intelligence, this is one area that is my singular priority when it comes to ensuring that our intelligence community is focused on its core mission of securing our country, seeking out the truth and reporting that truth so that our president can make the best-informed decisions. So, anything else that distracts from that, we want to get out of the way, whether it's these inappropriate chat rooms or the more serious threats that we've seen of the weaponization and politicization of our intelligence to undermine the fabric of our democratic republic,"" she added.

Meanwhile, India on Monday raised the issue of anti-India activities carried out by the banned pro-Khalistani organisation Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) in the US during the meeting of defence minister Rajnath Singh and Tulsi Gabbard, PTI reported citing sources.

A US federal judge's order blocking the Donald Trump administration's move to deport hundreds of alleged illegal immigrants under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act failed to yield an immediate result as the verbal instruction to turn the planes around was not specified in a written order.

Flights were mid air at the time of the ruling.

The US government deported over deported over 200 Venezuelans to a sprawling prison in El Salvador. Another aircraft was headed for Honduras.

The White House, which has already labelled Tren de Aragua a terrorist organisation, had prepared to transfer about 300 suspected members to detention in El Salvador, AP reported. The Donald Trump administration had agreed to pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison about 300 alleged members of the gang for one year.

US District Judge James E Boasberg was hearing a suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, which preemptively sued Donald Trump late Friday, saying five Venezuelan men being held at an immigration detention centre in Texas were at “imminent risk of removal” under the Alien Enemies Act.

Donald Trump formally invoked the act granting war time powers on Saturday to target alleged illegal immigration aided by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. “The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States,” the US president had said.

The act, which has been invoked only three times in US history, deports people suspected to be illegal immigrants without an opportunity to be heard before an immigration or federal court judge.

On Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt asserted that the administration was not flouting court orders. “The administration did not ‘refuse to comply' with a court order. The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA aliens had already been removed from US territory,” she said.

“A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrier full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from US soil,” the statement added.

Department of Justice, in its appeal of the judge's order halting the deportation of five Venezuelan men, said it would not use Trump's proclamation of the extraordinary act for further deportations if the court decision is not overturned.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele reacted to Boasberg's ruling in a post on social media platform X. “Oopsie…Too late,” he wrote.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who negotiated the deal with El Salvador, wrote on X, “We sent over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua, which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars.”

The Venezuelan government rejected the latest deportation measure by the US government, saying it was evocative of “the darkest episodes in human history, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps.”

Authorities have revealed that Joshua Riibe, the person of interest in the disappearance of University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki, was interrogated by Dominican Attorney General Yeni Berenice Reynoso and Navy Vice Admiral Agustin Morillo Rodriguez until nearly 3 am on Sunday, March 16, according to the Spanish-language outlet Noticias SIN. Riibe, an Iowa native and a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, has been “in custody” since shortly after Konanki disappeared on March 6, the outlet reported. He is expected to be questioned on Monday, March 17, again.

While Riibe is considered a person of interest, he has not been charged or accused of wrongdoing. Authorities in the Dominican Republic have confiscated his passport so he can't leave until the investigation is over. The Dominican government said that he has also been put under police monitoring, the New York Post reported.

“Joshua Steven Riibe, who has been identified as a ‘person of interest,' remains in custody and is being interrogated at the National Police's Gender Violence Unit to gather more information about the incident,” a rep for the Caribbean nation said in an update recently.

“As long as authorities consider Joshua Steven Riibe a key element in the investigation, he will remain in custody,” the notice added.

Riibe claimed that he and Konanki went into waist-deep waters, but were soon swept out to sea by a big wave, following which he grabbed Konanki to save her and brought her back closer to shore. In the process, he swallowed sea water, he claimed.

“It took me a long time to get her out, it was difficult,” Riibe told officials, according to a transcript obtained by Noticias SIN. “I was a lifeguard in the pool, not in the sea.”

“The last time I saw her I asked if she was ok,” he allegedly added. “I didn't hear her answer because I started vomiting all the sea water I had swallowed.”

Riibe said he passed out on the beach, and later woke up and returned to his room, assuming Konanki had left too. Meanwhile, clothing believed to belong to Konanki was found on a lounge chair at the beach where she went missing.

An unusually violent weather system tore across several US states over the weekend, bringing deadly tornadoes, dust storms, and fast-moving wildfires from Mississippi to Oklahoma, claiming at least 37 lives.

The National Weather Service confirmed that while tornado watches were lifted, severe weather conditions still posed a threat through Sunday evening across parts of the Southeast, including the Carolinas, northern Florida, and Georgia.

Death toll: At least 37 people have died as destructive winds, fires, and storms wreaked havoc from Mississippi to Oklahoma. Missouri has recorded the most casualties, with at least 12 people dying by tornadoes that ravaged the state.

Most deaths in Missouri: While 12 died in Missouri, deadly tornadoes swept through central areas of Alabama, killing at least three, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves confirmed six deaths from tornadoes, with over 200 people displaced across the state, two fatalities were confirmed in Oklahoma due to the fires and eight people were reported dead in Kansas. In Texas, three people died amid the dangerous dust conditions. In Arkansas, three deaths ere confirmed.

 

‘High risk' event: Forecasters had labeled the storm system as a ""high risk"" event, although extreme weather in March is not unusual. US President Donald Trump expressed condolences and offered assistance to the affected regions.

Death toll expected to rise: As emergency crews continue to search for survivors, the death toll is expected to rise as recovery efforts continue. “It's really disturbing for what happened to the people last night,” news agency Associated Press quoted Dakota Henderson, a local resident. Henderson recounted the chaos in Missouri's Wayne County, where only one room of a house remained standing.

 

Wildfires: In addition to the tornadoes, fast-moving wildfires ravaged Texas and Oklahoma, fueled by high winds. Over 130 fires were reported in Oklahoma, causing widespread damage and destruction. Two fatalities were confirmed in the state due to the fires.

Prince Harry is potentially facing being booted out of the US as an American court has ordered that documents related to the Duke of Sussex's visa application must be made public by Tuesday, March 18.

As per court documents dated March 15, Judge Carl Nichols' ruling has pushed the Department of Homeland Security to release redacted versions of the files following The Heritage Foundation's freedom of information (FOI) request.

Also read | Donald Trump deports hundreds as federal court order fails to turn around planes

The conservative US think tank alleged that the duke may have lied about his past illegal drug use that should've disqualified him from getting his US visa. The organisation cited his allusions to using cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms in his memoir “Spare” to question his entry into the US in 2020.

Despite previously shutting out the FOI request, DHS lawyers agreed in February to release redacted versions of the immigration forms. “Specifically, defendant would propose redacting all information in these items that would reveal information that the court has determined defendant can withhold,” lawyer John Bardo said in a court filing.

The latest development also comes after President Donald Trump intervened, ruling out Prince Harry being deported from the US. “I'll leave him alone,” he told the New York Post in February. Referring to his wife, Meghan Markle, Trump added, “He's got enough problems with his wife. She's terrible.”

On the contrary, the US president previously refuted the chances of Prince Harry getting “special privileges” if he was found to have lied on his application. “No. We'll have to see if they know something about the drugs, and if he lied they'll have to take appropriate action,” he said in a GB News interview with Nigel Farage in March 2024.

On his part, the duke wrote in his memoir how cocaine “didn't do anything for me,” adding “Marijuana is different, that actually really did help me.”

India has been highflying in chess recently, and the icing on the cake was D Gukesh's World Championship victory in Singapore last year, where he defeated Ding Liren. Meanwhile, Koneru Humpy also became the Women's World Rapid Champion.

The current live chess rankings have three Indian GMs in the top-ten, with Gukesh in third position, behind Magnus Carlsen and second-placed Hikaru Nakamura. Meanwhile, Arjun Erigaisi is in fifth position and R Praggnanandhaa is eighth.

After his sensational Prague Masters campaign, Aravindh Chithambaram had a huge jump, climbing eight places higher to World No. 14. Meanwhile, India legend Viswanathan Anand has fallen to 15th.

Recently, Anand spoke to TV9 Telugu, where he was asked about India's new GMs, and he passed his verdict on the likes of Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa and Arjun.

“In some ways we already are the superpower in chess. There are many metrics by which we are. There are many measures by which some of the country is. We are not dominant like the Soviet Union used to be, but if you take for instance the age of our top players with me as an exception, well I think the oldest one is 21,” he said.

“They're all incredibly young which means they have a long time ahead. Second. they are all in the top 10 together or in the top 20 top 50, then the number keeps increasing. They're all there together and can you imagine how fantastic that is for us because they will not only try to have the best results, but the moment one of them has a good result, all the others will be motivated to catch up. So they have this beautiful combination of friendship and rivalry,” he added.

Recently, Nihal Sarin also climbed two spots higher in the rankings, and is currently World No. 41. Meanwhile, Vidit Gujrathi is 24th and Harikrishna Pentala is 30th.

US Intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard said the US is deeply concerned about the situation in Bangladesh

The United States is deeply concerned about the situation in Bangladesh, US Intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard told NDTV World today, speaking about the persecution of religious minorities. She said that the Trump administration is focused and committed to defeat ""Islamist terrorism"" globally.

In an exclusive interview to NDTV World, United States' Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, said, ""The longtime unfortunate persecution, killing, and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and others has been a major area of concern for the US government and President Trump and his administration.""



She went on to say that the new Cabinet under Donald Trump has begun talks with the interim government in Bangladesh. ""The talks are just beginning between President Trump's new cabinet coming in and the Government of Bangladesh, but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern,"" she said, while speaking about the rise of Islamic extremism and terrorist elements in Bangladesh.

In her remarks she spoke about the ideology of an ""Islamic Caliphate"" and how extremist elements and terror groups globally aim for such an outcome. ""The threat of Islamist terrorists and the global effort of different terror groups are routed in the same ideology and objective - which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate,"" she said, adding that ""This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they chose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.""

Ms Gabbard went on to say that Donald Trump is determined to identify and defeat such an ideology and end the rise of what he calls ""radical Islamic terrorism"".

""President Trump remains committed to identifying the ideology that drives Islamist terrorism, and working to defeat this ideology and their ability exact that terror on people,"" Ms Gabbard said.

Besides the violence and religious persecution in Bangladesh, its growing synergy with Pakistan's notorious ISI has become a major cause of concern over the last two months.

Last month Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi stated that he was concerned about the presence of ISI officials in Bangladesh areas close to India's border regions, especially the Siliguri corridor. Speaking to news agency ANI, General Dwivedi said that they must make sure that those anti-India elements must not be able to use that soil to send terrorists to India.

""I had used the word epicentre of terrorism for a particular country (Pakistan). Now those countrymen, if they go to any other place and they happen to be our neighbor, as far as I am concerned, I should be concerned about it. That they should not be able to use that soil to send terrorists to India,"" General Dwivedi said.

When PM Modi and Donald Trump met in Washington in February, the US President had said that he will let Prime Minister Modi handle the situation in Bangladesh. ""This is something that the Prime Minister has been working on for a long time. Frankly, I have been reading about it. I will leave Bangladesh to the Prime Minister,"" President Trump said at a joint press briefing.

India on Monday urged the United States to act against banned Khalistani terror group Sikhs for Justice - which operates from American soil - and its founder, US-based lawyer Gurpatwant Singh Pannun - who faces 104 criminal cases in this country, including eight by anti-terror agency NIA.

The SFJ is linked to anti-India activities, including threats to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, the government has said.

The call for action came as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh met Tulsi Gabbard, the US' Director of National Intelligence, who is in India as part of a multi-nation tour of the Indo-Pacific, in Delhi this afternoon. They discussed key aspects of defence cooperation and intelligence sharing.

After the meeting Mr Singh posted on X, ""Happy to have met the US Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard in New Delhi. We discussed a wide range of issues which include defence and information sharing, aiming to further deepen the India-US partnership.""

Ms Gabbard has already met Mr Doval - with whom she discussed ways to strengthen intelligence sharing between the two nations - and is due Tuesday to address the Raisina Dialogue, a multi-national forum on geopolitics and geoeconomics hosted by India since 2016.

Mr Doval, sources told NDTV, had also raised the Khalistani terrorist issue, with specific reference to concerns about anti-India elements operating from American soil.

India has repeatedly demanded Western countries - including the US, the United Kingdom, and Canada - crack down on Khalistani symapthisers and terrorists operating from those countries.

Prime Minister Modi and US President Donald Trump - who met in Washington, D.C. last month - spoke at length on organised crime in America and the nexus with the Khalistani network.

The two leaders had then pledged to expand law enforcement cooperation and act against organised crime syndicates, including narco-terrorists, human and arms traffickers.

At a joint press conference then, President Trump had been asked about the presence of Khalistani terror groups in the US. He did not, however, provide a direct answer.

Also, the call-out to Ms Gabbard and the US came as India and New Zealand discussed the same issue. ""About Khalistan... this was an issue that came up. We do alert our friends to the activities of anti-India elements in their countries and their abuse of freedom of speech and other democratic freedoms to glorify terrorism and to threaten attacks against India,"" the External Affairs Ministry said.

All of this comes against the backdrop of the US and Canada accusing India of allegedly targeting Khalistani terrorists abroad. The US had accused an ex-Indian intelligence officer of involvement in a (failed) plot to assassinate Pannun and ex-Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claimed Indian officials had a role in the killing of another Khalistani terrorist, Hardeep Nijjar, in Vancouver.

India has firmly rubbished both allegations. In fact, a Canadian commission report filed in January said ""no definitive link (with a) foreign state"" had been proven in the killing of Nijjar.

Months before that, in October, Mr Trudeau confessed during a public inquiry into his allegations that he had no ""hard evidentiary proof"" to support claims of 'Indian agents' being linked to Nijjar's killing.

In January 15, a high-level inquiry committee set up by India to probe organised crime and terrorist organisations affecting both India and the US submitted its report. The committee had been set up in response to American allegations about the attempted assassination of Gurpatwant Pannun.

The committee recommended that legal action be taken against the ex-Indian intelligence officer - identified as 'CC1' in the indictment filed in New York City - for allegedly orchestrating the foiled plot.

Meanwhile, earlier today Ms Gabbard spoke exclusively to NDTV and underscored the strength of the relationship between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi.

The attack took place on a highway in Balochistan's Noshki

The Baloch rebels behind the train siege in Pakistan have released a video of their latest attack on a paramilitary convoy that left five people dead on Sunday, including three Pakistani soldiers.

The attack took place on a highway in Balochistan's Noshki, and the video released by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) shows an explosion and plumes of smoke coming out of a bus.

A police official said evidence from the site of the attack suggested that a suicide attacker rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the convoy.



""After the blast, some other terrorists opened fire on the FC personnel, but in the retaliatory firing, two of them were killed. Two civilians and three soldiers also died,"" the news agency PTI quoted the police official as saying.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the ""cowardly"" attack and said it ""cannot shake our resolve against terrorism"".

On Tuesday, the BLA hijacked a passenger train and held hostages for 36 hours.

They took over the Jaffar Express in a remote mountain pass in Balochistan province by blowing up train tracks. That attack killed 31 soldiers and civilians.

The BLA, the strongest rebel group active in Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, frequently carry out attacks targeting security personnel in the oil and mineral-rich province, fighting for its independence.

In a recent statement, the group said, ""The valuable natural resources in Balochistan belong to the Baloch nation. Pakistani military generals and their Punjabi elite are looting these resources for their own luxury.""

The BLA has around 5,000 members, with a growing number of women, including law students and medicine graduates, participating in its activities.

Following the assassination of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Abu Qatal in Pakistan, foreign affairs experts have suggested that Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind behind the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, might face a ""similar fate"" soon.

Speaking with the news agency ANI, Robinder Sachdeva said that Abu Qatal's killing indicates that those tracking LeT founder Hafiz Saeed and other terrorists are closing in.

""Hafiz Saeed's close aide was killed, which means those who are tracking them have reached quite close. It is said that those who live by the sword die by the sword, and Hafiz Saeed might as well have to face a similar fate. Abu Qatal was involved in a lot of attacks in Kashmir, Rajouri, Poonch, PoK,"" Mr Sachdeva said.

Mr Sachdeva speculated that Saeed might have tightened his security following his nephew's assassination.

""Hafiz Saeed's next step might be to increase his security and ask help from the Pakistani army, though they are already protecting him... No one can say who is behind this incident, but this could also have been possibly done by Pakistani authorities to defame India,"" he added.

Commenting on reports of another person being injured in the attack, Major General Dhruv C Katoch (Retd.) suggested that it could be Hafiz Saeed himself.

""The other injured person has been admitted to the Pakistan military hospital, and this has created a buzz since Pakistan is very tight-lipped about the identity of the person, and some emerging reports suggest it is Hafiz Saeed,"" he told ANI.

He added that no terrorist is truly safe in Pakistan, even with the Army's protection and that they will eventually be ""hunted down.""



""I don't think it matters whether it is Hafiz Saeed or not, the important point is that he has not been able to sleep comfortably at night... Since he is on the run and on the target list, no terrorist in Pakistan is safe despite the fact that the Pakistani army is giving him all the security... The broader message going out is that they are not safe despite the security and they will be hunted down,"" he said.

Abu Qatal, charge-sheeted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the January 2023 Rajouri attacks, was shot dead in Pakistan after an assailant opened fire on his vehicle on the Mangla-Jhelum Road, local media reported on Sunday.

An armed guard of Qatal was also killed in the attack that took place on Saturday night, as reported by an Islamabad-based outlet, The News International.

Qatal was the nephew of Hafiz Saeed, the founder of LeT and the mastermind behind the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. Saeed is wanted in India for numerous rerror-related cases.

The International Criminal Police Organization, also known as Interpol, has issued a global alert in search of an Indian-origin student, Sudiksha Konanki, who went missing in the Dominican Republic.

Ms Konanki, a Virginia resident studying at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, mysteriously disappeared during a spring break visit to the Caribbean country.

Interpol's yellow notice, which is issued for missing persons such as victims of kidnappings or ""unexplained disappearances"", said that Ms Konanki was last seen in Punta Cana on March 6. 

The 20-year-old is 1.6-metre tall and has three piercings on her right ear, the Interpol notice read. She has black hair and brown-coloured eyes, it added.

Ms Konanki was reported to be vacationing with five female college friends at a resort in Punta Cana. Surveillance video showed her and her friends walking toward the beach. The others later returned to the hotel, while she was seen with Joshua Riibe, a senior at St Cloud State University in Minnesota, who has now been named the ""person of interest"".

Joshua Riibe has reportedly accepted that he was with Sudiksha Konanki on the night she disappeared.

According to a transcript obtained by NBC News, Mr Riibe said they were ""in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little"" when a strong wave pulled them out to sea.

Mr Riibe, who is a trained pool lifeguard, claimed he tried to hold Ms Konanki under his arm while swimming back to shore, making sure she could breathe. He struggled to stay afloat, saying, ""I took in a lot of water.""

When they reached shallower waters, Mr Riibe set Ms Konanki in front of him and saw her ""walking at an angle in the water."" He last asked if she was okay but didn't hear her response as he began vomiting the seawater he had swallowed.

By the time he recovered, she was nowhere to be seen. Thinking she had left, Mr Riibe passed out on a beach chair. Surveillance footage later recorded him returning to his hotel alone, hours later.

While Dominican authorities initially suspected that Sudiksha Konanki drowned, her family has urged investigators to explore other possibilities, like abduction. 

The family also finds it unusual that Ms Konanki's phone and wallet were left with her friends, as she always carried her phone with her.

She reportedly lives with her family in Loudoun County, Virginia and studies biology and chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

A pair of US astronauts stuck for more than nine months on the International Space Station will be returned to Earth on Tuesday evening, NASA said.

Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams are to be transported home with another American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon craft, which arrived at the ISS early Sunday. 

The stranded duo have been on the ISS since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.

NASA said in a statement on Sunday evening that it had moved forward the astronauts' anticipated ocean splashdown off the Florida coast to approximately 5:57 pm Tuesday EDT (3:27 am IST, Wednesday). It was initially slated for no sooner than Wednesday.

""The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favorable weather conditions expected for later in the week,"" the space agency said.

NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will also return on the Dragon capsule, with the journey to be broadcast live from Monday evening when hatch closure preparations begin.

For Wilmore and Williams, it will mark the end of an ordeal that has seen them stuck for nine months after what was meant to have been a days-long roundtrip.

Their prolonged stay was significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months. 

But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by NASA astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station.

Still, the unexpected nature of their prolonged stay away from their families -- they had to receive additional clothing and personal care items because they hadn't packed enough -- has garnered interest and sympathy.

President Donald Trump has declared Biden's presidential pardons ""void"" over autopen use.

Former US President Joe Biden faces uncertainty after his successor Donald Trump has declared that Biden's last-minute presidential pardons, including one to his son Hunter Biden, are ""null and void"".

President Trump said that Joe Biden may not even have been aware of what all was being signed in his name as an autopen was used to sign these documents. President Trump made this announcement on his social media platform Truth Social late on Sunday night.

An autopen is a robotic instrument that is used by government officials, including the US President, to sign documents on behalf of the said authority, keeping in mind the sheer volumes of correspondence they have to sign. Such signatures are usually communicated to the person in-charge as they need not necessarily be aware of such signatures.

US Presidents have used the autopen for decades.

""The 'pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of political thugs, and many others, are hereby declared void, vacant, and of no further force or effect, because of the fact that they were done by autopen. In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them, but more importantly, he did not know anything about them,"" President Trump stated. He however, did not give any proof of this claim.

Mr Trump went on to say that all such people who were falsely ""pardoned"" by Biden just before he demitted office will now face investigation. ""The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden. He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime. Therefore, those on the Unselect Committee, who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me, and many other innocent people, should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level.""

Concluding his post, President Trump wrote, ""The fact is, they were probably responsible for the Documents that were signed on their behalf without the knowledge or consent of the Worst President in the History of our Country, Crooked Joe Biden!""



The presidential pardon is an absolute power that all US Presidents have. Even the courts, including the Supreme Court cannot intervene in such a matter. In the past courts have been opposed to putting any limits or restrictions on how these pardons are granted.

Should Donald Trump convert his statement into a presidential order, it would mean that the investigation agencies will probe those who were ""pardoned"" and the US Justice Department may potentially go after and prosecute some of Donald Trump's arch rivals and political adversaries.

Donald Trump however, told reporters on board the Air Force One late on Sunday night that ultimately the courts should decide on the validity of the pardons. ""It's not my decision. That will ultimately be up to a court. But I would say that they (Biden's last-minute pardons) are null and void, because I'm sure Biden didn't have any idea that it was taking place, and somebody was using an autopen to sign off and to give these pardons,"" President Trump said, alleging that these were forged documents.

In a significant ruling in 2024, a US federal appeals court had noted that a presidential pardon doesn't necessarily have to be in writing. ""The plain language of the US Constitution imposes no such limit,"" the court had said.

The US presidential pardon has been an absolute power of all US Presidents for more than a century now. So far they have never been challenged, but Donald Trump's move on Sunday night may lead to an attempt to upend such tradition. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Tulsi Gabbard, the United States' Director of National Intelligence, in Delhi Monday evening. This was after she spoke to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and he called for action against Khalistani terror group Sikhs For Justice outfit and its founder, Gurpatwant Pannun.

During their meeting the two also exchanged gifts; Mr Modi presented the US intel chief with a vase with Ganga water from Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj, which hosted the Maha Kumbh.

This is Ms Gabbard's second meeting with the Prime Minister in two months; the two met in February, when Mr Modi was in Washington, D.C. for a bilateral with President Donald Trump.

Then, Mr Modi and Ms Gabbard discussed ways to enhance cooperation to tackle threats like terrorism and cybersecurity, and ""set the tone and vision for a stronger India-US partnership"".

Ranjani Srinivasan, a 37-year-old Indian student pursuing a doctoral degree in urban planning at Columbia Univeristy, self-deported last week, days after their student visa was revoked for participating in pro-Palestine protests. The US Department of State had cancelled their visa on March 5, citing security concerns related to her involvement in alleged activities ""supporting Hamas"".

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in a post on X, called Srnivasan a ""terrorist sympathiser"", saying that those who ""advocate terrorism and violence"" must not stay in the US.

Srinivasan, who is currently in Canada, recalled their ordeal, calling it a ""dystopian nightmare"".

""I'm fearful that even the most low-level political speech or just doing what we all do - like shout into the abyss that is social media - can turn into this dystopian nightmare where somebody is calling you a terrorist sympathiser and making you, literally, fear for your life and your safety,"" Srinivasan told the New York Times.

According to Srinivasan, their activity on social media had been mostly limited to liking or sharing posts that highlighted the human rights violations in the Gaza war. ""I'm just surprised that I'm a person of interest...I'm kind of a rando (slang for random),"" they told NYT.

Srinivasan's decision to leave the US came two days after the federal immigration officials visited her home, causing fear and uncertainty in them. She said the situation had become extremely ""volatile and dangerous"" that they made the a quick decision to self-deport and leave the country, the NYT reported. The Indian student just packed their bags, left their cat behind with a friend, and left, it added.

Self-deporting, or leaving voluntarily before authorities take action, avoids the risk of one being put on a US military aircraft and sent home like the deportees who recently arrived in India.

Columbia University's website shows Srinivasan referring to themselves with the gender-neutral ""they"" pronoun.

Srinivasan was doing research focussing on the evolving nature of land-labour relations in peri-urban statutory towns in India and received support from the Lakshmi Mittal South Asia Institute for it. They have a Bachelor's Degree from CEPT (Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology) University in Ahmedabad and a Master's Degree from Harvard with Fulbright Nehru and Inlaks Scholarships. They have worked for an environmental advocacy nonprofit in Washington on ""frontier communities at risk from climate change"" and as a researcher for the West Philadelphia Landscape Project (WPLP) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who is on a two-day trip to India, on Monday told NDTV that it was ""unfortunate"" that she ""missed"" the Holi celebrations in the country.

Holi, also known as the festival of colours, was celebrated on Friday, two days before Ms Gabbard, who follows Hindu tradition, arrived in India.

Asked what Holi means to her, she said it is a ""wonderful and colourful"" celebration of life and the ""connection that we all share as people"".

""This is something from my home in Hawaii, where we greet each other with 'Aloha'. Here in India, we greet each other with 'Namaste'. But the deeper spiritual meaning of these two words is the same in recognizing the eternal and divine spirit that exists within all of us,"" she said.

Besides key meetings, the intel chiefs will attend The Raisina Dialogue - a multilateral conference organised by the Observer Research Foundation and India's Ministry of External Affairs.

Five Eyes is an international intelligence alliance comprising the US, UK, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. The alliance originally evolved from a secret World War II partnership between cypher and code breaking teams from Britain and the United States.

Three of the Five Eyes members - US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, UK's National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell and New Zealand's intelligence chief Andrew Hampton - are in New Delhi for the three-day summit, which will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon is also in New Delhi and will be the chief guest at the global conference.

During their visit, the global intelligence chiefs also attended a top strategy conference organised by the National Security Council Secretariat, where they were hosted by India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval. R&AW chief Ravi Sinha and Intelligence Bureau or IB chief Tapan Deka were also present at the top-level meeting.

The meeting, organised by India, shows New Delhi's growing global role in strategic and security matters. It also assumes significance amid concerns of radicalisation and rise of extremist elements in Canada by 'Khalistani' separatist groups.

The intelligence chief are also attending The Raisina Dialogue, which is seeing a participation and attendance from more than 120 countries who have sent Heads of States, Heads of Governments, spy chiefs, top ministers, military commanders, tech bosses, industry leaders, research analysts, scholars, think tank chiefs, and experts on matters of strategy and geopolitics.

Could lumpy metallic rocks in the deepest, darkest reaches of the ocean be making oxygen in the absence of sunlight?

Some scientists think so, but others have challenged the claim that so-called ""dark oxygen"" is being produced in the lightless abyss of the seabed.

The discovery -- detailed last July in the journal Nature Geoscience -- called into question long-held assumptions about the origins of life on Earth, and sparked intense scientific debate.

The findings were also consequential for mining companies eager to extract the precious metals contained within these polymetallic nodules.

Researchers said that potato-sized nodules could be producing enough electrical current to split seawater into hydrogen and oxygen, a process known as electrolysis.

This cast doubt on the long-established view that life was made possible when organisms started producing oxygen via photosynthesis, which requires sunlight, about 2.7 billion years ago.

""Deep-sea discovery calls into question the origins of life,"" the Scottish Association for Marine Science said in a press release to accompany the publication of the research.

Delicate Ecosystem

Environmentalists said the presence of dark oxygen showed just how little is known about life at these extreme depths, and supported their case that deep-sea mining posed unacceptable ecological risks.

""Greenpeace has long campaigned to stop deep sea mining from beginning in the Pacific due to the damage it could do to delicate, deep sea ecosystems,"" the environmental organisation said.

""This incredible discovery underlines the urgency of that call"".

The discovery was made in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a vast underwater region of the Pacific Ocean between Mexico and Hawaii of growing interest to mining companies.

Scattered on the seafloor four kilometres (2.5 miles) beneath the surface, polymetallic nodules contain manganese, nickel and cobalt, metals used in electric car batteries and other low-carbon technologies.

The research that gave rise to the dark oxygen discovery was partly funded by a Canadian deep-sea mining business, The Metals Company, that wanted to assess the ecological impact of such exploration.

It has sharply criticised the study by marine ecologist Andrew Sweetman and his team as plagued by ""methodological flaws"".

Michael Clarke, environmental manager at The Metals Company, told AFP that the findings ""are more logically attributable to poor scientific technique and shoddy science than a never before observed phenomenon.""

Scientific Doubts 

Sweetman's findings proved explosive, with many in the scientific community expressing reservations or rejecting the conclusions.

Since July, five academic research papers refuting Sweetman's findings have been submitted for review and publication.

""He did not present clear proof for his observations and hypothesis,"" said Matthias Haeckel, a biogeochemist at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel, Germany. 

""Many questions remain after the publication. So, now the scientific community needs to conduct similar experiments etc, and either prove or disprove it.""

Olivier Rouxel, a geochemistry researcher at Ifremer, the French national institute for ocean science and technology, told AFP there was ""absolutely no consensus on these results"".

""Deep-sea sampling is always a challenge,"" he said, adding it was possible that the oxygen detected was ""trapped air bubbles"" in the measuring instruments.

He was also sceptical about deep-sea nodules, some tens of millions of years old, still producing enough electrical current when ""batteries run out quickly"".

""How is it possible to maintain the capacity to generate electrical current in a nodule that is itself extremely slow to form?"" he asked.

When contacted by AFP, Sweetman indicated that he was preparing a formal response. 

""These types of back and forth are very common with scientific articles and it moves the subject matter forward,"" he said.

A spokesperson stated that fire investigators were not required at the scene, and the investigation was being handled by Hilton Hotel building management.

Surfers Paradise resident Ralph Kogler was jolted awake by a loud bang at 2 a.m. on Friday. Rushing to his window, he saw the hotel's roof engulfed in flames.

""Exploding fragments scattered across at least 10 different ledges down the building, making it look as though the entire side was on fire-it was unbelievable,"" Kogler said.

He described how burning debris landed on a restaurant in the hotel's lower levels, igniting coffee shop tables and even an umbrella.

""At its peak, the glow from the flames on multiple levels was so intense that we feared we might have to evacuate,"" he added.

Melbourne Cup-winning jockey Shane Dye, who lives in a residence within one of the Hilton towers next to the burning building, said he had been working in his lounge when he saw the blaze.

""I'm only 30 meters away, and my window directly faces the tower that caught fire,"" Dye told Racenet. ""Everything was in flames-I couldn't believe it.""

He said confusion followed the evacuation.

""The guy at the front desk didn't know what was going on. Then suddenly, people ran in, shouting that the whole place was on fire, debris was falling, and we needed to get out.""

Fortunately, no one required medical treatment, and all guests were allowed to return to their rooms once the fire was extinguished.

Police do not consider the fire suspicious, but investigations are ongoing.

Tulsi Gabbard EXCLUSIVE Interview with NDTV

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump are ""very good friends (and are) focused on shared objectives"", which include a firm commitment to defeat Islamic terror worldwide, Tulsi Gabbard, the United States' Director of National Intelligence told NDTV Monday in an exclusive interview.

""The ties between the US and India go very far back and (in Trump's second term) we are continuing to see the strengthening of that partnership and recognising the mutual interest of both countries - centred around peace, prosperity, freedom, and security,"" she said in Delhi.

""... with President Trump's leadership in the US and of course, Prime Minister Modi's longstanding leadership in India - we have two leaders of two great countries who are very good friends and very focused on how we can strengthen the shared objectives and interests.""

Ms Gabbard also referred to her meeting with Mr Modi in the US last month, when they spoke about enhancing cooperation to tackle terrorism, cybersecurity, and other emerging threats. That meeting with Mr Modi, she told NDTV this afternoon, ""set the tone and vision for a stronger India-US partnership"".

""My visit here is predicated on the work that has already been done."" she said.

The United States is deeply concerned about the situation in Bangladesh, Ms Gabbard said.

""The longtime unfortunate persecution, killing, and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and others has been a major area of concern for the US and President Trump,"" she said.

On Russia's war on Ukraine, she declared Donald Trump ""is seeing this conflict with very clear eyes"".

The President, she said, will have a productive conversation with Russia's Vladimir Putin - they are expected to speak Tuesday, following talks between American and Russian officials - and ""... is focused on peace. His priority is to end this war. Negotiations have just begun.""

Ms Gabbard also slammed Donald Trump's predecessor - Joe Biden - for making no effort to try to end the war. ""There was no effort at peace or (to have a) direct dialogue with Putin,"" she said.

Ms Gabbard also spoke about the Houthi threat in the Red Sea region, acknowledging the Iran-backed military group had been attacking the key shipping route for ""a very long time"" and criticising the Biden administration for, again, having made ""no serious effort to stop it"". She also pointed to Mr Trump re-recognising the Houthis as a 'foreign terrorist organisation' after Joe Biden removed them from that list.

She also underlined India and the US' common goal in this aspect, stating, ""Our country and another (referring to India) should not be in a position to re-route commerce just because of the Houthi threat.""

These comments come days after the Houthis claimed a second attack on American ships in 24 hours, calling both ""retaliation for deadly US strikes"". The Houthis had initially said they had launched 18 missiles and a drone at American aircraft carrier Harry Truman and its accompanying warships.

Washington, D.C. has vowed to keep striking Yemen until the rebels stop attacking Red Sea shipping, with President Donald Trump warning he will use ""overwhelming lethal force"".

On Sunday the US launched large-scale strikes on Yemen, with Trump warning the Iran-aligned Houthis ""their time is up"". Trump also warned Iran that it needed to ""immediately"" halt support for the group.

The strikes killed 31 people and injured 101, mostly women and children, the Houthis claimed.

Tulsi Gabbard is in India as part of a multi-nation visit to the Indo-Pacific; the trip will include stops at Japan and Thailand, and focus on ""building strong relationships, understanding, and open lines of communication"" to achieve Trump's 'peace, freedom, and prosperity' objectives.

The visit to India comes a month after Mr Modi's visit to the US.

The Prime Minister was among the first global leaders to call on Donald Trump after he took oath - on January 20 - for a second term that has, so far, been headlined as much by efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war as it has by the deportation of illegal immigrants and trade tariffs.

A day before the two sat down to talk, Mr Trump had announced a new reciprocal tariff policy for US trade partners, among whom he had named India, China, and Brazil as countries that levy ""tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them"" and called this ""very unfair"".

Ms Gabbard - a soldier who served with a medical unit in Iraq and a former Democrat Congresswoman from Hawaii - joined the Republicans in October last year.

She was appointed as the US' DNI - a role that oversees 18 American intelligence agencies, including the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, on a budget of nearly $100 billion - last month.

The appointment was not without controversy. Critics pointed out her lack of direct military or intelligence experience. Many also pointed to remarks about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and her 2017 visit to Syria, when she met with then-President Bashar al-Assad while he was under US sanctions.

Jordan Belfort, the infamous stockbroker known as the 'The Wolf of Wall Street', has thrown his weight behind US President Donald Trump's latest tariff hikes, dismissing criticism as ""complete and utter nonsense."" He argued the move was necessary to revive American manufacturing and correct long-standing trade imbalances.

""There's going to be corrections in markets. So, I think you need to look past that and say, well, what are these tariffs doing for the long-term fundamental health of the economy?"" he said on Fox & Friends.

His remarks come as the stock market reels from concerns over a trade war. The S&P 500 closed in correction territory, reflecting investor anxiety over Trump's 25 per cent tariff on steel and aluminium imports and a proposed 200 per cent tariff on European champagne and alcohol products. Canada and the European Union have already vowed retaliatory tariffs, deepening fears of an economic standoff.

Despite the market reaction, Trump told reporters, ""I'm not going to bend at all."" Defending the policy, he said, ""We're going to take back our wealth, and we're going to take back a lot of the companies that left.""

Belfort echoed this, saying that restoring domestic production was essential for the US economy. ""You can't just be a consumer nation,"" he said. ""It's like being on a sugar high for 50 years. At some point, you're bleeding the wealth out of the country.""

Economists have warned that tariffs could raise costs for consumers and strain global trade relations, to which Belfort said, ""I think the only people who are panicking are probably, you know, on CNBC trying to make everyone panic.""

He also suggested that opponents of Trump's policies would criticise him no matter what. ""Whatever he does, they're gonna say they hate it, 'it's the worst thing in the world.' ... You start to just ignore it. It's complete and utter nonsense.""

""If he didn't have tariffs, they would be saying, 'How could he not be addressing tariffs?! He has to put tariffs on things. Everyone is taking advantage of us!'"" he went on.

During the same Fox & Friends appearance, Belfort also heaped praise on Tesla CEO Elon Musk, calling him a ""hero"" and even promising to purchase a Tesla that very day. ""I'm gonna buy a Tesla today, by the way,"" he declared, earning a nod from co-host Brian Kilmeade.

With Tesla sales declining globally amid Elon Musk's controversial political shift and worker protests at US dealerships, Trump recently promoted the automaker at the White House. Turning the South Lawn into a Tesla showroom, Trump called Musk his ""first buddy"" and even bought a Tesla himself. He also warned that anyone caught vandalising the cars could be labelled a ""domestic terrorist.""

Jordan Belfort was convicted of securities fraud and money laundering in the 1990s for a $200 million stock scam. He pleaded guilty in 1999, served 22 months in prison, and was ordered to repay $110 million, much of which remains unpaid.

His crimes were dramatised in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The mutual respect between New Delhi and Beijing is openly on display. The latest being Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""positive"" remarks on the ties between the two countries, which China has ""appreciated"", saying that a ""dragon-elephant dance"" cooperation is the only correct choice for the two neighbours. 

""Let me stress that in the 2000 plus years' history of interactions, the two countries have maintained friendly exchanges"" and both the countries learned from each other contributing to civilisational achievements and human progress,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters.

The statement follows PM Modi's interaction with US-based podcaster and computer scientist Lex Fridman where he said normalcy has returned to the India-China border after his recent talks with President Xi Jinping to defuse tensions ignited by the 2020 clashes between the two armies in eastern Ladakh. The Prime Minister said that his government is focused on ensuring that differences do not escalate into disputes.

""Our focus is to ensure that these differences don't turn into disputes. That's what we actively work toward. Instead of discord, we emphasise dialogue, because only through dialogue can we build a stable, cooperative relationship that serves the best interests of both nations,"" PM Modi told Lex Fridman.

The China spokesperson said the successful meeting between Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Kazan, Russia, in October provided strategic guidance for the improvement and development of bilateral ties.

In November last year, Indian and Chinese troops started patrolling along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh after a gap of over four years. Patrolling was stopped in these two areas in eastern Ladakh for about four and a half years after the two sides clashed in the Pangong Lake and Galwan regions in May-June 2020.

""It is true that there have been ongoing border disputes between us. And in 2020, the incidents along the border created significant tensions between our countries. However, after my recent meeting with President Xi, we have seen a return to normalcy at the border,"" PM Modi said. 

Both sides, said the China spokesperson, have earnestly followed through on the important common understandings, strengthened exchanges and achieved positive outcomes.

As the two largest developing countries, China and India have shared the task of accelerating their development and revitalisation and understand and support each other's successes, she said.

This serves the fundamental interests of over 2.8 billion people, meets the common aspiration of regional countries, and follows the historical trend of the Global South growing stronger and conducive to world peace, she further added.

The two countries should be partners that contribute to each other's success and a ""cooperative pas de deux"", a ballet dance between dragon and elephant, is the ""only choice for both sides"", she said, reiterating the recent comments by Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the development of bilateral ties.

China stands ready to work with India to implement the important common understandings between the two leaders, take the 75th anniversary of the diplomatic relations as an opportunity and advance bilateral ties on the track of stable and sound development, she said. 

""Our cooperation is not only (mutually) beneficial but also essential for global peace and prosperity,"" said PM Modi.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, the two US astronauts currently stuck in space for nine months, had an unlikely 'alien' friend around when the newly arrived SpaceX crew docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Sunday (Mar 16). In footage shared by ISS on X, Crew-9 commander Nick Hague was seen entering the hatch of the spacecraft wearing an alien face mask.

Mr Hague floated towards a smiling Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore while pointing to something off-camera while moving offscreen. The Crew-9 commander wore the extraterrestrial outfit while awaiting the arrival of Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Pesko, who will be taking over from him and his Crew-9 members.

Notably, Mr Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, have been in space since last September and are joining the stranded duo on their flight back home. Ms Williams, who was clicking pictures of the joyous incident, spoke to mission control and expressed happiness after hugging the incoming members.

""Houston, thank you for tuning in this early morning. It was a wonderful day. Great to see our friends arrive. Thank you so much,"" Ms Williams said.

M Hague's antics did not go unnoticed by the eagle-eyed social media users who were amused by the sight of an alien-mask-wearing astronaut floating in the ISS.

""What's with the guy in the alien mask? Is no one else seeing that? Did I miss something here?"" said one user while another added: ""Amazing. Love the camaraderie and happy to see their sense of humor is intact! Safe journey back home.""

A third commented: ""Why is no one commenting about the Alien who was caught on camera?""

NASA in a statement on Sunday evening informed that it had pushed the astronauts' anticipated ocean splashdown off the Florida coast to approximately 5:57 pm Tuesday EDT (3:27 am IST, Wednesday). It was initially slated for no sooner than Wednesday.

The stranded pair of Mr Wilmore and Ms Williams, flew to the ISS aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule on June 5 last year on what was supposed to be an eight-day test mission. However, the two were forced to endure a nine-month ordeal owing to safety concerns about the Boeing capsule.

National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Sunday held bilateral talks with US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and chaired a conclave of top global intelligence czars focusing on boosting cooperation in confronting various security challenges including terrorism and threats posed by emerging technologies.

In their one-on-one meeting, Mr Doval and Ms Gabbard mainly discussed ways to strengthen intelligence sharing and working closely in the security domain in sync with the India-US global strategic partnership, it is learnt.

Ms Gabbard arrived in the national capital early Sunday on a two-and-a-half-day trip in the first high-level visit to India by a top official of the Donald Trump administration.

It was ""good discussion"", top sources told PTI on the Doval-Gabbard meeting.

The US director of national intelligence, Canadian spy chief Daniel Rogers, and UK National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell were among top global intelligence czars who attended the India-hosted security conclave here.



The deliberations were held behind closed doors and there was no official word on them.

However, it is learnt that the top intelligence and security officials focused on sharing of intelligence and cooperation to tackle terrorism and threats posed by emerging technologies.

The meeting also focused on security in the Indo-Pacific region, cooperation to counter terror funding and money laundering and issues relating to extradition and immigration, people familiar with the matter said.

The Indian side also raised its concerns about anti-India elements operating from foreign soil, including pro-Khalistan elements, they said.

Intelligence chiefs of Australia, Germany, New Zealand and several other friendly countries of India were learnt to have attended the conclave.

Ms Gabbard is visiting India as part of a multi-nation tour of Japan, Thailand and France.

The US intelligence chief will also address the Raisina Dialogue on Tuesday.

Last month, Gabbard met Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Washington DC.

In their deliberations, the intelligence chiefs were understood to have deliberated on various global challenges including implications of the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in the Middle East.

The visit to India by Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) chief Rogers has taken place amid frosty ties between the two countries over the Hardeep Singh Nijjar case.

The ties between India and Canada came under severe strain following the then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations in September 2023 of the ""potential"" involvement of Indian agents in the killing of Nijjar on Canadian soil.

New Delhi rejected Trudeau's charges as ""absurd"". The relations nosedived further in the second half of last year after Ottawa linked several Indian diplomats including High Commissioner Sanjay Verma to the murder of Nijjar.

In October last, Canada expelled Mr Verma and five other diplomats. In retaliation, New Delhi also expelled Canadian Charge d'Affaires Stewart Wheeler and five other diplomats. It is expected that the case may figure during Doval's conversation with Rogers.

It is Ms Gabbard's second foreign trip after assuming charge as the director of national intelligence. During her first international trip, Gabbard travelled to Germany to attend the Munich Security Conference last month.

US President Donald Trump has shared a video of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's interview with Computer scientist and podcaster Lex Fridman on his social media platform Truth Social.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump shared a link to PM Modi's podcast.

During the interview, PM Modi spoke on diverse issues, including artificial intelligence (AI), cricket, football, China, US President Donald Trump, Pakistan, and his early life.

During the interview, PM Modi appreciated US President Donald Trump's unshakeable dedication to his country, particularly in the wake of the assassination attempts last year.

Recalling Trump's resilience and determination during campaigning for US elections, even after being shot, he said, ""When he was shot during the recent campaign, I saw the same resilient and determined President Trump, the one who walked hand-in-hand with me in that stadium. Even after being shot, he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation.""

He also drew parallels between Trump's ""America First"" ideology and his own ""India First"" approach, highlighting their shared commitment to prioritizing their nations' interests. This alignment has fostered a strong connection between the two leaders.

""His reflection showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in Nation First. I stand for India first and that's why we connect so well. These are the things that truly resonate. And I believe that across the world politicians are covered so much by the media that people mostly perceive each other through its lens. People rarely get the chance to truly meet or personally know one another and perhaps third-party intervention is the real cause of tensions,"" he added.

Recalling their memorable meeting at the ""Howdy Modi"" event in Houston in 2019, Modi praised Trump's humility and courage, noting that the then-president of the United States sat in the audience while he spoke from the stage.

""We had an event in Houston, Howdy Modi. Both President Trump and I were there and the entire stadium was completely packed. A massive crowd at an event in the US is a huge moment. While packed stadiums are common in sports, this was extraordinary for a political rally...Both of us delivered speeches and he sat down below listening to me speak. Now, that's his humility. The President of the United States sitting in the audience while I spoke from the stage, that was a remarkable gesture on his part,"" he said.

After finishing his speech, PM Modi suggested taking a lap around the stadium to greet the large crowd of Indian diaspora. courage. Despite strict security protocols, Trump agreed to take a lap around the stadium with Modi, demonstrating their mutual trust and respect.

""After finishing my speech, I stepped down and as we all know, security in the US is extremely strict and thorough. The level of scrutiny there is on a completely different level. I went over to thank him and casually said, ""If you don't mind, why don't we take a lap around the stadium? There are so many people here. Let's walk, wave and greet them."" In American life, it's almost impossible for the President to walk into a crowd of thousands, but without even a moment's hesitation, he agreed and started walking with me,"" he added.

PM Modi described the moment as ""truly touching,"" adding that ""It showed me that this man had courage. He makes his own decisions, but also he trusted me and my lead at that moment enough to have walked with me into the crowd.""

""It was that sense of mutual trust, a strong bond between us that I truly witnessed on that day,"" PM Modi added, ""and the way I saw President Trump that day walking into a crowd of thousands without even asking security, it was truly amazing. And if you watch the video now, you'll be amazed.""

PM Modi also appreciated Trump's kind gestures, including his warm words about their friendship even after his first term ended.

""Later, when his first term ended, and President Biden won, four years passed, but during that time whenever someone we both knew met him, and this must have happened dozens of times, he would say, 'Modi is my friend, convey my regards.' That kind of gesture is rare. Even though we didn't meet physically for years, our direct and indirect communication, our closeness and the trust between us remained unshaken,"" he said.

In addition, PM Modi praised Trump's preparedness and clear vision in his second term, observing that he seems ""far more prepared than before.""

""I have observed President Trump both during his first term and now in his second run. This time, he seems far more prepared than before. He has a clear roadmap in his mind with well-defined steps, each one designed to lead him toward his goals,"" he said.

PM Modi also noted that during his recent visit to the United States, he met with several influential figures, including Tech billionaire Elon Musk, US Vice President JD Vance, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and American entrepreneur and politician Vivek Ramaswamy. He added that his meeting with Elon Musk was particularly warm and friendly, as Musk was accompanied by his family and children.

She moved to the UK in 2012 on a student visa for a master's degree at the University of Oxford. She later obtained a spouse visa as a dependent of her husband.

In addition to denying her the right to stay in the UK based on the number of days she spent overseas, the Home Office denied her the right to stay in the UK because she does not have a family life in Britain. This was despite her and her spouse being married for over ten years and residing in south London.

The review states, ""You must now leave the United Kingdom. If you don't leave voluntarily, you may be subject to a re-entry ban of 10 years and prosecuted for overstaying.""

Ms Dutta and her husband, Souvik Naha, applied for an indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in the UK in October last year on the grounds of staying in the country for a longer period. The UK Home Office approved her husband's application but rejected Ms Dutta's.

The reason for rejection was that she didn't meet certain requirements. People who apply for ILR, a permanent stay in the UK without needing a visa, should have lived in the UK for a specific number of years.

The UK immigration rules also state that a person cannot be outside the country for more than 548 days in over 10 years. However, Ms Dutta was away for 691 days, 143 days more than the limit.

Ms Dutta, who is now an assistant professor at University College Dublin, said she was shocked when she got an email threatening her to leave. 

She said, ""I have been employed at different universities in the UK and I've lived here for 12 years. A large part of my adult life has been lived in the UK since I came to the University of Oxford to do my master's. I never thought something like this would happen to me.""

Mr Naha, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow, said, ""This decision from the Home Office has been terribly stressful for both of us. It has taken a psychological toll. I sometimes give lectures about these issues and have read articles about people affected, but never thought it would happen to us.""

Her lawyer, Naga Kandiah, at MTC Solicitors, said, ""These research trips were not optional but essential to fulfilling her academic and institutional obligations. Had she not undertaken these trips, she would not have been able to complete her thesis, meet the academic requirements of her institutions or maintain her visa status.""

A legal appeal has been filed against the Home Office's decision to deport Dutta from the UK. The Home Office responded, saying it would reevaluate its choice within three months. However, there is no guarantee that they will change their decision.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Missing Indian-American student Sudiksha Konanki and Joshua Riibe, the person of interest in the case, were seen together at an outdoor bar before she vanished from a Dominican Republic beach on March 6. A new footage, obtained by local outlet Noticia SIN, shows Ms Konanki at the bar with friends.

At one point, she puts her hand over her mouth, steps away, and hunches over a patch of grass before returning to the bar. She then rejoins her friends, jumps in excitement and hugs a female companion.

In the same footage, a man, believed to be Joshua Riibe, is seen outside the bar, seemingly drunk. Another young man appears to comfort him as Mr Riibe stumbles backwards.

Both Ms Konanki and Mr Riibe appear to be wearing the same outfits seen in previously released surveillance footage - Ms Konanki in a white dress with her hair in a ponytail and Mr Riibe in the same clothing from earlier recordings of them walking together before she disappears. The two did not interact in the new video and were in separate groups.

A second video shows Ms Konanki with three other girls in the lobby of the RIU Hotel & Resort, wearing the same clothes.

Ms Konanki, a pre-med student at the University of Pittsburgh from South Riding, Virginia, had travelled to the Dominican Republic for a vacation with five friends. On the night of March 5, they went out to party at a resort nightclub in Punta Cana.

Surveillance footage captured them at the club before heading to the beach at around 4:15 am. Most of her friends left by 5:50 am, leaving Ms Konanki alone with Mr Riibe, a college senior from Minnesota she met that night. A separate clip from the Riu Republica Resort shows Ms Konanki walking arm-in-arm with Mr Riibe, along a resort pathway, accompanied by her friends.

Mr Riibe, a senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota and originally from Iowa, has been in custody since Ms Konanki's disappearance. He was interrogated by Dominican police until nearly 3 am on March 16. Authorities have not charged him but have confiscated his passport as the investigation continues.

Mr Riibe told investigators he was with Ms Konanki in waist-deep water, ""talking and kissing a little"", when a strong wave pulled them out to sea. As a trained pool lifeguard, he said he tried to hold Ms Konanki under his arm while swimming back to shore, ensuring she could breathe. He said he struggled to stay afloat, saying, ""I took in a lot of water.""

Once they reached shallower waters, he set her in front of him and saw her ""walking at an angle in the water"". He last asked if she was okay but didn't hear her response as he began vomiting seawater. When he recovered, she was gone. Thinking she had left, Mr Riibe blacked out on a beach chair.

Dominican authorities continue their search for Sudiksha Konanki, 11 days after her disappearance. While officials believe she may have drowned, her family suspects foul play. Mr Riibe remains a person of interest, but no charges have been pressed against him.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

St Patrick's Day 2025: St Patrick's Day is an annual Irish holiday, celebrated on March 17 every year. The colourful festival is observed to honour the memory of Saint Patrick -- the patron saint of Ireland and one of Christianity's most widely-known figures. Countries with a strong Irish presence hold parades, festivals, and various events to commemorate the day and celebrate Irish culture.

Originally celebrated as a religious feast to mark St Patrick's work, the day now highlights Irish history and culture. It is marked as a national holiday in Ireland and Northern Ireland but people across the world are involved in the celebrations, despite having no connection to either of the countries.

Little is known about Saint Patrick but he is believed to be a Roman-British Christian missionary and Bishop who introduced Christianity to Ireland in the fifth century. As per a BBC report, he was sold into slavery in Ireland as a child. Once he was free, he became a priest and returned to the country as a missionary.

Legend has it that St Patrick died on March 17. To commemorate his memory, people in Ireland started observing a feast day on March 17 around the ninth or 10th century.

Green is the dominant colour of St Patrick's Day and people wear green clothes, decorate their houses in green and prepare food with green leafy vegetables like cabbage. Traditionally people pin clover-shaped leaves and violet flowers of the Irish shamrock plant on the lapel. Meat, cabbage dishes and beer dominate the food tables while some prepare the classic Irish Stew, soda bread and apple pie.

In Ireland and Northern Ireland, thousands gather in towns and cities to revel in the festivities. Parades and cultural events are held. The annual parade in Dublin draws more than one million people pepole.

In America, the St Patrick's Day celebrations started during the early colonial period. The first recorded celebration in the 1600s and parades in the 19th century mark the significance of St Patrick's Day or St. Paddy's Day in the United States.

In New York City, the St Patrick's Day Parade, which was started in 1762 - typically attracts two million people. While not a legal holiday, the day is widely recognised and celebrated all over the US. Meanwhile, in Great Britain, the day is celebrated with the third-largest parade in the world, after Dublin and New York.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Trump administration used Alien Enemies Act to deport about 250 alleged gang members to El Salvador

The White House has denied allegations that it engaged in a “a blatant violation” of a judge's order by deporting about 250 Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador on Saturday, with the US border czar appearing to contradict the denial on Monday by declaring: “I don't care what the judges think.”

The US district judge James E Boasberg has scheduled a hearing for Monday afternoon to demand an explanation about why his Saturday order order temporarily blocking the deportation flights had apparently been ignored.

The Trump administration had ordered at least some of the deportations using the Alien Enemies Act, a law from 1798 that is meant to be used during wartime. The president quietly invoked the law on Friday and progressive groups almost immediately sued to stop it.

On Saturday, during a court hearing over the case, Boasberg added a verbal order that any flights that had already departed with Venezuelan immigrants using the Alien Enemies Act turn around and return to the US.

“This is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately,” he told the justice department, according to the Washington Post.

At that point (about 6.51pm ET, according to Axios), both flights were off the Yucatán peninsula, according to flight paths posted on X.

Later on Saturday night, however, El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, confirmed that the planes had landed in his country and the alleged gang members were in custody, posting on social media, “Oopsie … too late” above a news article about the judge's order to turn the planes around.

White House officials insisted that the migrants were no longer in US territory when the judge issued his order, claiming that it therefore did not apply.

The administration “did not ‘refuse to comply' with a court order”, said the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, in a statement on Monday.

She also argued, however, that the order itself did not need to be followed in the first place.

“The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA aliens had already been removed from US territory,” Leavitt said. “The written order and the administration's actions do not conflict.

“As the supreme court has repeatedly made clear – federal courts generally have no jurisdiction over the president's conduct of foreign affairs, his authorities under the Alien Enemies Act, and his core Article II powers to remove foreign alien terrorists from US soil and repel a declared invasion.

“A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft carrying foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from US soil.”

Other Trump administration officials, who have not been named, echoed similar statements to Axios about the ruling coming too late, claiming that the administration did not defy the judge as the planes were “already outside of US airspace” and therefore arguing that the order was “not applicable”.

ABC News also reported that the administration cited “operational” and “national security” reasons that the planes needed to land, and that the two planes took off during the hearing on Saturday.

When asked by a reporter on Sunday whether the administration violated the judge's orders, Donald Trump said: “I don't know, you have to speak to the lawyers about that.” He added: “I can tell you this, these were bad people.”

Reuters reported that the Trump administration stated in a court filing on Sunday that “some” of the Venezuelans had already been removed from the US before the judge's order, but did not provide any further details.

The New York Times noted that the filing implied that the government had other legal grounds for the deportations of the Venezuelans, other than the use of the Alien Enemies Act that was blocked by the judge.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, which sued to stop the use of the act, added in a court filing on Monday that they believe that the government violated the court order , calling the administration's actions a “blatant violation of the court's order”.

The rights groups asked the judge to compel the administration to clarify whether any flights departed after the judge's orders, and to provide more information on the flight timings.

On Monday morning, Boasberg scheduled a 4pm hearing for the Trump administration to explain if they defied his order.

Later on Monday morning, Tom Homan, Trump's “border czar”, told reporters: “By the time the order came, the plane was already over international waters, with a plane full of terrorists and significant public safety threats.”

He added: “To turn the plane around over international waters” and “come back with terrorists back to the United States, that's not what this president promised the American people”.

He followed up the remarks in an appearance on Fox and Friends, where according to the Hill he said: “I don't care what the judges think. I don't care.”

He repeated his claim that the flight was “already in international waters” but also questioned why the judge would want “terrorists returned to the United States”: “Look, President Trump, by proclamation, invoked the authorities of the Alien Enemies Act, which he has a right to do, and it's a gamechanger.”

The Georgetown law professor Steve Vladeck criticised the administration's argument that it was too late to act once the planes had left the US. He argued on social media that “a federal court's jurisdiction does not stop at the water's edge” but rather, “the question is whether the defendants are subject to the court order, not where the conduct being challenged takes place”.

Vladeck also told the Associated Press that although the judge's verbal directive to turn around the planes was not technically part of his final written order, nevertheless the Trump administration clearly violated the “spirit” of it.

Peter Markowitz, a Cardozo Law School professor and immigration enforcement expert, told Reuters that he believed the Trump administration's actions “most certainly violate” the court's order.

In a statement on Monday, the Democratic senators Alex Padilla, Cory Booker, Dick Durbin and Peter Welch condemned Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.

“Let's be clear: we are not at war, and immigrants are not invading our country,” they said. “Furthermore, courts determine whether people have broken the law – not a president acting alone, and not immigration agents picking and choosing who gets imprisoned or deported.”

The deportations may not be the only instance of the White House directly violating a court order, after the administration reportedly deported Dr Rasha Alawieh, a kidney transplant specialist and Brown University professor, despite a court order temporarily blocking her expulsion.

Citing her attorney and court documents, the New York Times reported that the 34-year-old Lebanese citizen – who had a valid US visa – was detained on Thursday upon returning to the US after visiting family in Lebanon.

Raphaël Glucksmann quips that US should give back 19th-century gift from France over Trump's approach to Ukraine

A French European parliament member has quipped that the US should return the Statue of Liberty, which it received as a gift from France about 140 years ago, after Donald Trump's decision “to side with the tyrants” against Ukraine.

Trump's White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, then responded to Raphaël Glucksmann on Monday by calling him an “unnamed low-level French politician” and saying the US would keep the statue.

Taunting France's conquest by Nazi Germany during the second world war before the allied forces – including the US – then defeated the Nazis, Leavitt added: “It's only because of America that the French are not speaking German right now.” She also said France “should be very grateful to our great country”.

Glucksmann, of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, kicked off the exchange when – evidently with his tongue in his cheek – he said it appeared to him that the US had come to “despise” the statue as well as what it symbolizes.

“So, it will be just fine here at home,” Glucksmann said.

Glucksmann also referred to a crackdown on “scientific freedom” in the US in his remarks at a party convention, first reported by Agence France-Presse.

His comments amount to a verbal protest after Trump suspended military aid and intelligence gathering on Ukraine, in an apparent attempt to strong-arm its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in the negotiations to end the war started by Russia, which invaded in February 2022.

The US president upbraided Zelenskyy during a televised diplomatic meltdown in the Oval Office on 28 February, which caused significant alarm across Europe for appearing to signal that the Trump administration generally favors Russia in the conflict. The US later restored military aid, but on Monday it was reported the US was withdrawing from an international body formed to investigate responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine.

Trump and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, for whom the US president has repeatedly expressed admiration, are tentatively scheduled to talk on Tuesday over the phone about ending the war in Ukraine.

Glucksmann's remarks additionally nodded to Elon Musk's brutal staffing and spending cuts to the US federal government, which have affected numerous health and climate research workers. Glucksmann said France could be in a position to benefit if any of the fired workers emigrated.

“If you want to fire your best researchers, if you want to fire all the people who, through their freedom and their sense of innovations, their taste for doubt and research, have made your country the world's leading power, then we're going to welcome them,” said Glucksmann.

“Give us back the Statue of Liberty. We're going to say to the Americans who have chosen to side with the tyrants, to the Americans who fired researchers for demanding scientific freedom: ‘Give us back the Statue of Liberty.' We gave it to you as a gift.”

France did indeed present the 305ft-tall, 450,000lb Statue of Liberty to the US in Paris on 4 July 1884, the 108th anniversary of the American declaration of independence from the UK. The US needed crucial military aid from France to win its revolutionary war and gain independence from the UK.

Nicknamed “Lady Liberty”, the torch-bearing statue – designed by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi of France – was then installed on an island in New York City's harbor and dedicated in 1886. There is a smaller copy of the statue on an island in the Seine river in Paris.

A bronze plaque on the Statue of Liberty's pedestal contains the words of a poem titled The New Colossus, which overtly references the large number of immigrants who arrived in the US in the 19th century and partially reads: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.”

Trump has been aggressively pursuing the deportation of immigrants. Recently, his administration deported a Brown University medical professor to Lebanon, despite her having a valid US work visa and a judge's order not to do so.

Prosecutors reportedly alleged that the professor had recently attended the funeral of Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, among other things.

The US also recently deported to El Salvador more than 250 people whom the White House accused of belonging to Venezuelan and Salvadorian gangs, despite a judge's order halting the flight.

US official urges stop to plan to re-evaluate Biden program to connect communities to high-speed internet, which will likely benefit Starlink

Small town USA is facing a “significant risk” that the Trump administration is going to abandon key elements of a $42.45bn Biden-era plan to connect rural communities to high-speed internet so that Elon Musk can get even richer, a top departing commerce department official warned in an email.

Evan Feinman, who headed up the so-called Bead program for the last three years, urged governors across the country to lobby their congressional delations in Washington to stop the Trump administration from implementing plans he said could have “deeply negative outcomes” for American homes and businesses.

“Stranding all or part of rural America with worse internet so that we can make the world's richest man even richer is yet another in a long line of betrayals by Washington,” Feinman said.

A copy of the email, which was first reported by Politico, was seen by the Guardian.

The Bead program, which stands for Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment, was passed with bipartisan support in 2021 and aimed to connect tens of millions of underserved homes and communities in rural America to high speed internet.

In administering the program, the Biden administration called on states to favor a certain kind of broadband technology – fiber – because it provides reliable and affordable service to consumers.

Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, has said he wants to re-evaluate the Bead program and make it technology “neutral”. That change is likely to favor Musk's company, Starlink, which owns about 62% of all operating satellites. It would be far less expensive for communities to be connected to high speed internet service through satellites, but most experts agree the service would not be as fast or reliable as fiber, and would cost consumers more.

The buildout of fiber networks across rural communities was also expected to create tens of thousands of jobs. Some investments – like the creation of AI data centers – are also reliant on states having fiber connections.

Musk himself as expressed disdain for the Bead program, once telling voters before November's election that he thought the program should be brought down to “zero”. While the program has also been criticized by some Republican legislators for being too bureaucratic, it has been widely seen as a boon for rural states.

But Lutnick's call for a review of the program has left states “in limbo”, Feinman said. In particular three states – Louisiana, Delaware, and Nevada – have already had their statewide plans to spend billions of dollars in Bead funding approved, but are now waiting for the federal government to release the funds.

“Shovels could already be in the ground” in those three states, Feinman said, were it not for the Trump administration's delays.

But Feinman suggested it was not too late for US states to lobby the administration to tweak the program – like abandoning labor and wage-related provisions – but leave the most significant aspects of it unchanged.

He said in his letter that the administration had not yet made decisions about whether states had to scrap plans they have for the buildout of fiber optic networks in their states and start fresh, or whether they would be allowed to proceed.

“Reach out to your congressional delegation and reach out to the Trump administration and tell them to strip out the needless requirements, but not to strip away from states the flexibility to get the best connections for their people,” Feinman wrote.

The commerce department did not respond to a request for comment. Starlink has not commented on the possible change to the Bead program.

US prosecutors allege Rasha Alawieh had ‘sympathetic photos and videos' related to key Hezbollah figures

A Brown University medical professor was deported to Lebanon over the weekend despite having a valid US work visa, defying a judge's order blocking her immediate removal from the country.

Federal prosecutors on Monday alleged that they deported 34-year-old Rasha Alawieh after discovering “sympathetic photos and videos” of prominent figures of Iran-backed Hezbollah, an immigration officer wrote in a report cited by Politico. A US homeland security department statement reported by NBC also said Alawieh had recently attended the funeral of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The case centering on Alawieh comes as Donald Trump's second presidential administration has been escalating its immigration policies and targeting universities.

On Sunday, the US deported more than 250 immigrants, allegedly members of a Venezuelan and Salvadorian gang, to El Salvador despite a judge's order halting the flights.

Alawieh was detained at Boston's Logan international airport on Thursday after a trip to Lebanon to visit family. Her cousin, Yara Chehab, filed a lawsuit soon after in Massachusetts federal court on her behalf.

On Friday, US district court judge Leo Sorokin issued an order scheduling a hearing for Alawieh on Monday – and said that the federal government must give 48 hours' notice to the court before her removal from the country. That hearing, however, was delayed at the request of an attorney for Chehab after other lawyers representing Chehab withdrew from the case, citing “further diligence”, as CNN reported. No other details were immediately available.

Nonetheless, in clear defiance of Sorokin's order from Friday, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) put Alawieh on a flight to Paris that presumably was a layover back to Lebanon.

On Sunday, Sorokin said in court documents that CBP had received notice of the court order but “nonetheless thereafter willfully disobeyed the order by sending [Alawieh] out of the United States”. Sorokin ordered the government to respond to the “serious allegations with a legal and factual response” and a description of their version of events by Monday morning, ahead of a scheduled court hearing.

CBP did not immediately respond to the Guardian's request for comment. In a comment to Reuters, a CBP spokesperson said that officers “adhere to strict protocols to identify and stop threats” and the burden is on people to establish admissibility into the US.

In a statement, a Brown spokesperson said that the university was “seeking to learn more about what has happened, but we need to be careful about sharing information publicly about any individual's personal circumstances”.

Brown noted that Alawieh had a clinical appointment with the university but was an employee of Brown Medicine, a non-profit that is affiliated with the medical school but is not operated by the university.

On Sunday, after Alawieh's deportation, Brown sent an email advising international students and faculty members to avoid international travel due to “potential changes in travel restrictions and travel bans”.

Dr George Bayliss, a Brown medical professor who works with Alawieh at the university's division of kidney disease and hypertension, told the New York Times that the staff “are all outraged”.

“None of us know why this happened,” he said.

Before Sunday's mass deportation to El Salvador, the US district court judge James Boasberg said that the Trump White House could not accelerate the deportations out by invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a centuries-old wartime law giving the president that ability. Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to explain whether it had violated the judge's order with its mass deportation at a hearing scheduled for late Monday afternoon.

On Sunday, the White House released a statement upbraiding Boasberg, an extraordinary display of defiance against the judiciary, which has served as a check on presidential power throughout the history of the US.

“A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movement of an aircraft … full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from US soil,” the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement.

Alawieh's removal also comes at a time when the Trump administration has targeted universities, particularly Columbia University, after the series of pro-Palestinian protests it saw in 2024.

Recently, federal law enforcement with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detained Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia graduate student with a green card who was a leader of the protests, for deportation.

Ranjani Srinivasan, a graduate student at Columbia from India, was also targeted by immigration authorities at the beginning of March despite having no ties to the protests. Srinivasan fled to Canada, which US officials have described as a “self-deportation”, according to the New York Times.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is also considering new travel restrictions for citizens of dozens of countries. A draft list of countries showed three separate groups that would undergo either full or partial visa suspensions.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

State plans to carry out first judicial killing in 15 years on Tuesday using  technique critics call inhumane

Louisiana is preparing to carry out its first execution in 15 years using a gassing method that is banned under the state's own laws for euthanizing cats and dogs.

Barring a last-minute intervention by the US supreme court, Jessie Hoffman, 46, is scheduled to die by nitrogen gas on Tuesday at Louisiana state penitentiary, commonly known as Angola prison. He was sentenced to death for the 1996 rape and murder of an advertising executive, Mary Elliott.

Should the execution go ahead, Louisiana would become only the second state to use nitrogen gas as a means of killing people. Lawyers for the condemned man have decried the pending procedure as cruel and unusual punishment.

They point to the four nitrogen executions that have been carried out in recent months in Alabama, in which all four prisoners displayed signs of distress on the gurney. They included Kenneth Smith, who eyewitnesses said shook violently, writhed and convulsed as he was forced to breathe pure nitrogen through a mask.

Another of the four, Alan Miller, shook and trembled on the gurney for about two minutes.

Nitrogen causes death by depriving the body of oxygen, essentially causing suffocation in a phenomenon known as hypoxia. As an indication of its controversial nature, it is frowned upon as a form of euthanasia for most mammals on grounds that conscious animals can be extremely distressed before they succumb.

The American Veterinary Medical Association has ruled that nitrogen should only be used to euthanise dogs and cats that have already been rendered unconscious through sedation. Those guidelines have been adopted into Louisiana state law, which specifically outlaws gassing as a method of euthanasia in cats and dogs.

Lee Capone, a Louisiana veterinarian for the past 45 years, was part of the campaign to ban gassing for mammals in the state. He became convinced that the method was an inhumane euthanasia technique after he saw dogs being killed with gas in the early 1980s.

“A large number of dogs were put into a concrete bunker and gassed. It was clear from their bodies, which had eyes wide open and dilated, saliva round the mouth, signs of vomiting and diarrhea, that they had been frightened and scared, and had suffered,” Capone told the Guardian.

He said that he had become convinced that gassing was inhumane for cats and dogs, “much less people”. Capone added that he found the idea of Hoffman being killed in this way “horrific. We are going backwards, it's not humane.”

Hoffman was granted a temporary reprieve last week from a federal judge. But the stay was overturned late on Friday by the fifth circuit court of appeals – one of the most ultra-rightwing federal courts in the country.

Photographs taken from inside the death chamber in Angola have been put into the public court record. They give the first insight into how the state intends to carry out the killing.

They show a blue, industrial-style mask lying on the gurney beside a leather strap and handcuffs. They also show a series of pipes through which the gas will be conducted.

Last year the Guardian revealed that three of the biggest manufacturers of medical-grade nitrogen in the US had put a block on their products being used in executions. Airgas, Air Products and Matheson Gas all took steps to prevent their nitrogen reaching departments of correction in death penalty states.

Airgas, which is owned by the French multinational Air Liquide, told the Guardian that it would not supply nitrogen or other inert gases “for the purpose of human execution”.

Photographs included as unsealed exhibits in ongoing litigation in Louisiana show that the corrections department has obtained canisters of nitrogen gas that were produced by Airgas, in apparent contravention of the company's prohibition.

The likely use of Airgas nitrogen in Tuesday's execution would be a direct breach of the firm's stipulation that it wants nothing to do with judicial killings.

The Guardian has reached out to Airgas for comment but did not immediately hear back from the company.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

President claims without evidence that January 6 panel members' pre-emptive clemency was not signed personally

Donald Trump claimed on Monday, without offering evidence, that pardons signed by Joe Biden were “void, vacant and of no further force and effect” because they were signed with an autopen.

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines an autopen as “a device that mechanically reproduces a person's signature”.

Trump made his claim in a post to his social media platform that used his abusive nicknames for Biden and members of the House January 6 committee, writing: “The ‘Pardons; that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen.

“In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!”

Close aides to Trump have said he often does not write his own Truth Social posts. They have also said his authorship can be detected by factors including the free use of capital letters.

Trump made the same autopen claim on board Air Force One on Sunday, telling reporters: “It's not my decision – that'll be up to a court – but I would say that they're null and void, because I'm sure Biden didn't have any idea that it was taking place, and somebody was using an autopen to sign off and to give pardons.”

The claim came after the Heritage Foundation, a pro-Trump rightwing thinktank, released a report into Biden's autopen use, claiming “whoever controlled the autopen controlled the presidency”. The fact-checking website Snopes debunked the claim, noting in a lengthy article various ways presidential signatures are affixed to documents, commonly including the use of a sample signature which a National Archives spokesperson said officials “use to create the graphic image for all presidential documents published in the Federal Register”.

Smithsonian Magazine has described how presidents since Thomas Jefferson have used devices to help them sign documents with greater efficiency. Jefferson, the third president from 1801 to 1809, used a polygraph, a device he found so useful he said he “could not live without it”.

According to the Smithsonian, “Harry Truman was the first president to use” an actual autopen, in the years after the second world war, “and [John F] Kennedy allegedly made substantial use of the device. However, the White House autopen was a closely guarded secret until Gerald Ford's administration publicly acknowledged its use”.

In 2011, Barack Obama faced controversy when he signed an extension of the Patriot Act, contentious national security legislation, with an autopen. In 2013, Obama memorably used an autopen to sign a congressional bill heading off financial disaster, while on vacation in Hawaii.

According to Snopes, it is “unclear whether Trump has signed legislation or policy with an autopen, although some reports suggest he signed campaign items for sale via the device”.

Furthermore, court precedents suggest Trump was wrong to say a president must personally sign any pardon, reprieve or other act of clemency.

In 1929, the US justice department held that “it is wholly for the president to decide” the method by which a pardon is handed down. Last year, a federal appeals court said presidential pardons do not even have to be in writing.

On 20 January, his last day in office, Biden gave pre-emptive pardons to family members and all members of the House committee that investigated the deadly January 6 attack on Congress, which Trump incited in his attempt to overturn his defeat by Biden in the 2020 election.

Two Republican Trump opponents, Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, sat on the committee. Both have since left Congress.

In his social media post, Trump wrote, again without providing evidence: “The necessary Pardoning Documents were not explained to, or approved by, Biden. He knew nothing about them, and the people that did may have committed a crime.”

Repeating unsubstantiated rightwing claims about the committee's treatment of records, he continued: “Therefore, those on the Unselect Committee, who destroyed and deleted ALL evidence obtained during their two year Witch Hunt of me, and many other innocent people, should fully understand that they are subject to investigation at the highest level.”

Members of the January 6 committee said they did not want pardons from Biden, stressing they did nothing wrong.

On Monday, Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chaired the committee, told Axios: “I am not afraid of Trump's latest midnight rant that has no basis in reality.”

Kinzinger wrote: “Please! You guys have been threatening this forever! Bring it on, it's getting boring waiting.”

Nonetheless, fear of revenge investigations and prosecutions remains high, particularly as Trump's administration targets government lawyers who investigated him in his two federal criminal cases and outside lawyers with links to Democrats.

Other recipients of pre-emptive pardons from Biden included Anthony Fauci, the public health adviser who rose to prominence under Covid, and Mark Milley, a retired general and chair of the joint chiefs of staff who has called Trump “a fascist to the core” and said he fears revenge.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Russia and allies were target of International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine

The Trump administration is withdrawing from an international body formed to investigate responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine in the latest sign that the White House is adopting a posture favouring Vladimir Putin.

The Department of Justice said it was pulling out of the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine (ICPA) two years after the Biden administration joined it with a commitment to hold Putin, Russia's president, to account for the 2022 invasion and subsequent crimes committed by Russian forces.

An announcement by the justice department was expected later on Monday.

The centre was established to hold the leaders of Russia and its allies in Belarus, North Korea and Iran accountable for a category of crimes listed as aggression under international law for undertaking and supporting the attack.

Merrick Garland, the US attorney general during Joe Biden's presidency, announced that the US would contribute $1m to the organisation, based in the Hague, in November 2023, making it the only non-European country to send a prosecutor to take part in the centre's investigation, along with prosecutors from Ukraine, Poland, the Baltic states, Romania and the international criminal court.

“The United States stands in steadfast and unwavering support for the people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy against the brutal and unjust war being waged by the Russian regime,” Garland said at the time.

On Monday, the New York Times cited an internal letter from the group's parent organisation, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust).

“The US authorities have informed me that they will conclude their involvement in the ICPA,” Michael Schmid, Eurojust's president wrote.

He said the centre's work would continue without US participation, with the group “fully committed” to holding accountable “those responsible for core international crimes”.

The decision follows weeks of tension between Donald Trump and Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, amid efforts by Washington to broker an end to the three-year war between Russia and Ukraine.

After Trump berated Zelenskyy publicly in the White House, the US suspended military assistance and intelligence sharing to Ukraine, although they were subsequently restored after Kyiv supported American calls for a ceasefire.

Trump had earlier called Zelenskyy “a dictator without election”, falsely accused him of provoking the invasion and said Putin wanted to end the war – although the Russian leader has yet to agree to a ceasefire.

The justice department also said it was reducing the work of its war crimes accountability team, set up by Garland in 2022 to hold Russia accountable for atrocities committed following its invasion of Ukraine.

Garland said at the time that “there is no hiding place for war criminals” and vowed that the department would “pursue every avenue of accountability for those who commit war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine”.

The unit provided logistical help, training and direct assistance to overburdened Ukrainian prosecutors, who are investigating more than 150,000 possible war crimes, including the summary execution of prisoners, the targeted bombing of civilians and torture.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Exclusive: 90% of Democrats, 57% of Republicans are worried about tariffs, with similar concerns about recession

Americans are increasingly concerned about Donald Trump's effort to overhaul the US economy with sweeping tariffs on foreign goods, according to an exclusive poll for the Guardian, despite the US president's efforts to downplay the risks of his strategy.

“Have no fear, we will WIN everything!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday, claiming that tariffs were already “pouring money” into the country.

But fears are growing. When given a list of issues including inflation, healthcare and immigration, 72% of Americans said they are concerned about tariffs.

The survey was conducted by the Harris Poll in early March. When it conducted the same survey in mid-January, 61% of those polled said tariffs were a concern.

A lot has changed since then. Since returning to the White House, Trump has pushed for tariffs against many of the US's key trading partners. He tacked on an extra 20% tariff on Chinese imports and hiked tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.

The president has also threatened to go further next month, promising sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on all imports from across the world and universal tariffs on all products imported from Canada and Mexico.

Amid widespread concerns, Trump and his cabinet have spent the last few weeks arguing that this strategy will bring jobs back to the US and ultimately lead to higher wages. The commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, conceded last week that a recession was possible, but suggested this would be “worth it”.

But so far, most Americans seem skeptical of this vision: 66% believe the US economy will take years to recover from Trump's tariffs, according to the survey.

The country remains divided. As shown in recent polling, how a person views the economy under Trump depends on their political party. Republicans were less likely than Democrats and independents to be concerned about the economy and inflation, a potential recession and tariffs.

90% of Democrats and 69% of independents said they are concerned about tariffs, compared to 57% of Republicans.

89% of Democrats and 75% of independents said they are concerned about a potential recession in the US, compared to 65% of Republicans.

85% of Democrats and 62% of independents said it will take years for the US economy to recover from the tariffs, compared with 52% of Republicans.

It's a sudden flip from how Republicans and Democrats viewed the economy last year while Joe Biden was president. Last May, 70% of Republicans said the economy was worsening, compared with 26% who indicated the same last month. Comparatively, 69% of Democrats now say the economy is getting worse, compared with 36% who said the same in May.

This is also reflected in whether someone believes the tariffs against Canada and Mexico are justified. The vast majority of Republicans believe that the tariffs are justified – 79% for tariffs against Mexico, and 75% for tariffs against Canada – while just over 30% for Democrats and about 40% of independents believe the same.

Americans across the board are still worried about the cost of living. Most Democrats (91%) and independents (88%), along with 82% of Republicans, said that they are concerned about the economy and inflation. Similar majorities said that they are concerned about being able to afford their living expenses.

The Trump administration has only doubled down on its strategy, and threatened more tariffs, in response to retaliatory tariffs against American exports.

When Ontario threatened tariffs on electricity exports to the US last week, Trump said he would double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada to 50%. Only after Ontario said it would drop its tariffs did Trump concede. After the EU put a retaliatory tariff on $28bn worth of American exports, including a 50% tax on American bourbon exports, Trump said he would put a 200% tariff on European alcohol imports.

Trump's insistence on tariffs comes in defiance of growing concerns that the policies could ultimately lead to a recession. The uncertainty has shaken Wall Street, which has had a turbulent last few weeks, despite recent better-than-expected data reports on the labor market and inflation that showed general stability in the economy.

Something that most people agree on, regardless of party: a majority (59%) believe that the tariffs won't last long. That includes 61% of Republicans, 60% of Democrats and 55% of independents.

“Most Americans are of the sentiment that ‘this too shall pass',” said John Gerzema, CEO of Harris Poll. “But there's growing concern that tariffs could have a lasting and unknowable impact on the economy, regardless of whether they're walked back soon or not.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Christian organizations helped create Pepfar, credited with preventing 25m early deaths, particularly in Africa

Christian evangelical organizations instrumental in creating the US program that has saved millions of lives from HIV/Aids are pressing the Trump administration to rescue the scheme from crushing cuts to foreign assistance.

The state department has said that the two-decade-old President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), which is estimated to have prevented 25m early deaths, is exempt from the cancellation of most US overseas aid. But the program is heavily reliant on logistical support from the US Agency for International Development (USAid), which has seen most of its projects killed off.

Evangelical groups, many of which backed Trump's election because of abortion policy, say delivery of anti-retroviral medicines (ARVs) funded by the US has all but ground to a halt in some countries, particularly in Africa. They warn that could lead to a resurgence of Aids in parts of the world where it has been brought under control, costing millions of lives.

But other evangelical organizations and churches have been accused of staying silent in defense of what has been described as one of the most successful foreign aid programs in US history for political reasons because so many of their members support Trump.

Emily Chambers Sharpe, health director at World Relief, the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, said that healthcare centers and hospitals in different parts of Africa report that “the supply chain for HIV as a whole has been very badly damaged” by the aid cuts.

“When Pepfar was up for reauthorization we, as World Relief, have supported it every time. We see it as really overarchingly a pro-life program in that it promotes the life-saving need for HIV treatment, which many of us in the field have called The Lazarus Effect,” she said.

“When you get someone on antiretroviral therapy, you see them literally be able to come back to life. And now we know if you're on antiretroviral therapy, you can even prevent the spread of the virus to others so it's not just life-saving for you, it can be life-saving for loads of other people.”

Chambers Sharpe criticised what she called a “lack of transparency” within the state department about cuts to USAid and its impact on Pepfar.

Galen Carey, vice-president of government relations at the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE), which has backed some of Trump's policies while also criticizing its harsh treatment of refugees as unChristian, called on the administration to save Pepfar before it is too late.

“We're encouraging the administration to get the program back up to full speed as soon as possible,” he said.

Carey said “there's quite a bit of concern in Congress because Pepfar has been a very popular bipartisan program” but he added that it has been caught up in the broader assault on foreign aid.

About 20 million people are reliant on medicines supplied by Pepfar mostly in Africa and parts of Asia. Some countries, such as Nigeria, depend on Pepfar for almost all their HIV funding. Others are less reliant but Pepfar still provides crucial health infrastructure because its clinics frequently employ medical staff who treat other conditions as part of the broader programme of combatting Aids.

Matthew Loftus, a doctor and evangelical Christian working at a mission hospital in Kenya, said the damage was already being done on the ground. He said that Pepfar “is being dismantled” and that “many people will die” as a result.

“In some places they're not getting the drugs or they're being asked to pay cash for the drugs. Other places are completely closed and so patients are scrambling to find medications or they're going without,” he said.

“There are going to be consequences. Once you stop taking ARVs, within days the virus can come back online and then start developing resistance. I'm really scared that there are going to be a bunch of people who haven't been taking their drugs and then, when we try to start them back, we're going to find that they're resistant. They could turn everything back on tomorrow and I think there would be permanent damage. Once you fire people and close clinics, rebuilding trust is difficult, getting people to come back is difficult.”

Evangelical Christian groups were instrumental in persuading President George W Bush to launch Pepfar in 2004. Carey said churches saw it not only as a pro-life position but an opportunity to promote their values.

“When I first went to Africa in 1997, an HIV-positive diagnosis was basically a death sentence. It was devastating. Many pastors spent much of their time conducting funerals. Driving along main roads in Kenya you would see shop after shop selling coffins,” he said.

“Over time, it really turned around in a dramatic way. The stories that came out of caring for orphans and helping local churches and promoting Christian understanding of sexual morality and faithfulness in marriage was an important piece of the puzzle since a lot of the transmission was through sexual contact. It fitted in with our broader concerns, both pro-life and pro-family.”

A change of heart by the acerbic segregationist senator, Jesse Helms, brought on a lot of conservative support by shifting the US narrative around Aids away from sexual morality.

In 2003, the rock star Bono told Helms that Aids had created 10 million orphans in Africa and that the lives of newborn babies could be saved by a single dose of a medicine that limited the transmission of HIV from mother to child. Helms was persuaded that Aids relief was a pro-life position and opened the door to congressional support for Pepfar.

Loftus has seen the impact of the programme on the ground in Kenya.

“Most HIV-positive patients I see are patients whose viral load is completely suppressed and they are coming to the hospital for a different problem. When I do see someone who dies of HIV-related illness, it's just another tragedy because now it's completely preventable,” he said.

“I hear stories from older missionaries. They talk about wards full of people with Aids, dying all the time. That's part of the fear looking ahead. If these programmes don't survive, what are we going to go back to?”

The call to save Pepfar has been joined by a range of religious groups, including the National Latino Evangelical Coalition. But Loftus said that, as an evangelical, he was concerned that many churches are not speaking up in support of the initiative, even though they have in the past, because it would mean criticising Trump.

“People I talk to are aggrieved about this. It is challenging the way that churches follow political trends rather than the other way around,” he said.

“Some churches are not as eager to put their necks out and advocate for something that seems to be opposed by some of the people in power. I think churches and Christians who are politically active are not aware of what's at stake, and many of them are probably consuming news in an environment that isn't even bringing it up as an issue. But I think also that there is this conflict now between our convictions versus who's in charge and who do we want to please?”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Karoline Leavitt also describes deportations as ‘counter-terrorism operation' as judge orders officials to explain if they defied court order

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt further rejected claims that the Trump administration illegally deported 250 immigrants suspected of belonging to a Venezuelan gang.

“This administration acted within the confines of the law, again, within the president's constitutional authority and under the authority granted to him under the Alien Enemies Act. We are quite confident in that, and we are wholly confident that we are going to win this case in court,” Leavitt said.

She also said that, despite reports to the contrary, the planes carrying the deportees had already left when a federal judge ordered them not to depart, and to turn back if they already had:

All of the planes that were subject to the written order, the judge's written order, took off before the order was entered in the courtroom on Saturday, and the administration will, of course, be happily answering all of those questions that the judge poses in court later today.

During last year's presidential campaign, Democrats attacked Donald Trump as planning to implement Project 2025, a rightwing blueprint to remake America's government. Trump responded by saying that he knows nothing about the plan, but the former director of Project 2025 now says he is very pleased with the Trump administration's moves so far. Here's more, from the Guardian's Martin Pengelly:

The director of Project 2025, a rightwing plan to dismantle the federal government which Democrats warned about last year and forced Donald Trump to attempt to disown it, said Trump's actions in power were proving “way beyond my wildest dreams”.

Paul Dans was director of Project 2025 for the Heritage Foundation, the hard-right group which has produced such policy plans for more than 40 years.

Project 2025 alarmed progressives with its advocacy of slashing government staffing and budgets and attacking protections for LGBTQ+ Americans; efforts to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion throughout government; attempts to tackle the climate crisis; and more.

Democratic attacks proved effective enough for Trump to claim he had “nothing to do” with the project. In July, as the Trump campaign scrambled to limit damage, Dans was forced out of his Heritage role.

Now, with Trump back in power, the president and his chief donor and ally, the Tesla and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk, have mounted an assault on the federal government that has already led to thousands of firings, a bonfire of climate regulations, attacks on DEI initiatives real and imagined and much more.

“It's actually way beyond my wildest dreams,” Dans told Politico. “It's not going to be the easiest road to hoe going forward. The deep state is going to get its breath back here, but the way that they've been able to move and kind of upset the orthodoxy, and at the same time really capture the imagination of the people, I think portends a great four years.”

Last week was a rough one for Democrats in Congress. The bad times began when Republicans moved ahead with a bill to authorize more government funding ahead of a Friday shutdown deadline, leaving the minority party, which objected to funding cuts in the legislation, in a pickle as to what to do.

House Democrats objected to the measure almost unanimously, but the real question was how Democratic senators would react, given that the bill needed at least eight of their votes to pass. Much of the caucus wanted to reject the legislation, but minority leader Chuck Schumer unexpectedly threw his support behind the measure, luring just enough Democrats for it to pass.

Schumer's decision enraged many in his party, to the point that he is now the target of protests by liberal activists who believe he needlessly sacrificed leverage he could have used to stand up to the Trump administration. The New York Times reports that Schumer has opted to cancel a public speaking tour to promote a new book, citing “security concerns”:

Mr. Schumer was scheduled to participate in promotional events in Atlanta, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, as well as a few stops in California, for his new book, “Antisemitism in America: A Warning.” Many Democratic activists, desperate for their leaders to stand up to President Trump, have been staging protests outside of Mr. Schumer's Brooklyn home and calling for his resignation. Online, they have been organizing protests for every stop on his book tour.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Schumer said that the tour was being rescheduled because of “security concerns.” But the move was immediately criticized by both the right and the left, who accused Mr. Schumer of being unwilling to face a restive public.

“We hope other Democratic senators continue meeting with their constituents and demand that their leadership fight with backbone,” Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in a statement.

Since voting on Friday for the stopgap bill, Mr. Schumer has been defending his decision to stave off a government shutdown, which he has said was the less devastating of two bad options that Senate Democrats were presented with. “I'll take some of the bullets,” Mr. Schumer said of the vitriol directed at him.

“There is no off-ramp,” for a government shutdown, Mr. Schumer said in an interview Friday from his office just off the Senate floor. “The off-ramp is in the hands of Donald Trump and Elon Musk and DOGE. We could be in a shutdown for six months or nine months,” he said, referring to Mr. Musk's cost-cutting team, the Department of Government Efficiency.

Donald Trump is scheduled to speak with Russia's Vladimir Putin tomorrow, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to share details of what the two leaders will discuss.

“I won't get ahead of those negotiations, but I can say we are on the 10th yard line of peace, and we've never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment,” Leavitt told reporters.

Here's more on what's expected from the call, and what it may mean for Ukraine:

Asked about Donald Trump's contention earlier today that Joe Biden's pardons of January 6 committee members were invalid, press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued that the former president may not have been of sound mind when he approved the order.

“The president was begging the question that I think a lot of journalists in this room should be asking, about whether or not the former president of the United States, who I think we can all finally agree, was cognitively impaired,” Leavitt said

“The president was raising the point that did the president even know about these pardons? Was his illegal signature used without his consent or knowledge?”

Pressed at her briefing on whether the Trump White House had evidence that Biden was not aware of what he was signing, Leavitt replied:

You're a reporter. You should find out.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt offered a preview of the argument that Trump administration lawyers will make in court today, saying that all planes carrying alleged deportees had departed by the time they received a written order to stop them from federal judge James Boasberg.

But evidence has emerged that Boasberg verbally told administration lawyers not to let the planes leave before they departed, and to order any in the air to turn back. Asked about that, Leavitt suggested that verbal instructions for a judge are less binding than written ones.

“All of the planes subject to the written order of this judge departed US soil,” Leavitt said, before addressing the discrepancy:

There's actually questions about whether a verbal order carries the same weight … as a written order, and our lawyers are determined to ask and answer those questions in court.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt further rejected claims that the Trump administration illegally deported 250 immigrants suspected of belonging to a Venezuelan gang.

“This administration acted within the confines of the law, again, within the president's constitutional authority and under the authority granted to him under the Alien Enemies Act. We are quite confident in that, and we are wholly confident that we are going to win this case in court,” Leavitt said.

She also said that, despite reports to the contrary, the planes carrying the deportees had already left when a federal judge ordered them not to depart, and to turn back if they already had:

All of the planes that were subject to the written order, the judge's written order, took off before the order was entered in the courtroom on Saturday, and the administration will, of course, be happily answering all of those questions that the judge poses in court later today.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt gave the Trump administration's version of events of the controversial deportation of undocumented immigrants suspected of belonging to a Venezuelan gang, describing it as “a counter-terrorism operation”.

The deportation appeared to fly in the face of a federal judge's order that the migrants not be removed from the United States while he considered the legality invoking the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport them.

“President Trump signed a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act regarding the invasion of the United States by the foreign terrorist organization, Tren de Aragua,” Leavitt said at a press briefing. “At the president's direction, the Department of Homeland Security carried out a counter-terrorism operation deporting nearly 200 violent Tren de Aragua terrorists, which will save countless American lives.”

In response to a question on why deportation planes were not turned around despite a judge's orders to do so, Donald Trump's border czar Tom Homan told reporters on Monday:

“The plane was already over international waters with a plane full of terrorists and significant public safety threats … The president did exactly the right thing.”

Homan went on to add:

“We removed terrorists. That should be a celebration in this country.”

Democratic senators including Alex Padilla, Dick Durbin, Peter Welch and Cory Booker have released a statement on Donald Trump invoking the Alien Enemies Act, which they argue is targeting immigrants without due process.

Together, the senators said:

“Let's be clear: we are not at war, and immigrants are not invading our country. Furthermore, courts determine whether people have broken the law – not a president acting alone, and not immigration agents picking and choosing who gets imprisoned or deported.”

Small-town USA is facing a “significant risk” that the Trump administration is going to abandon key elements of a $42.45bn Biden-era plan to connect rural communities to high-speed internet so that Elon Musk can get even richer, a top departing commerce department official warned in an email.

Evan Feinman, who headed up the so-called Bead program for the last three years, urged governors across the country to lobby their congressional delations in Washington to stop the Trump administration from implementing plans he said could have “deeply negative outcomes” for American homes and businesses.

“Stranding all or part of rural America with worse internet so that we can make the world's richest man even richer is yet another in a long line of betrayals by Washington,” Feinman said.

A copy of the email, which was first reported by Politico, was seen by the Guardian.

For the full story, click here:

The Trump administration sent 250 people, who were mainly Venezuelan and alleged to be gang members, to El Salvador, where the government has opened its prisons to deportees from the United States.

Human Rights Watch warns that conditions in the prisons are dangerous and inhumane:

Detainees in El Salvador's prison system are cut off from the outside world and denied any meaningful legal recourse. While [president Nayib] Bukele publicizes his prisons as “the best in the world,” the reality is very different. We have interviewed people released from these prisons and dozens who have relatives in jail. One after the other, we received and verified accounts of dismal detention conditions, torture and death.

One of the people we spoke with was an 18-year-old construction worker who said that police beat prison newcomers with batons for an hour. He said that when he denied being a gang member, they sent him to a dark basement cell with 320 detainees, where prison guards and other detainees beat him every day. One guard beat him so severely once, he said, that it broke a rib.

He said the cell was so crowded that detainees had to sleep on the floor or standing, an allegation we hear frequently, in a prison system where 108,000 detainees—1.7 percent of El Salvador's population—are crammed into spaces meant for 70,000. The U.S. State Department itself has described these conditions as “life-threatening.”

Like many others, the former detainee said that prisons were filthy and disease-ridden. While the Salvadoran government has denied Human Rights Watch access to their prisons, doctors who visited detention sites told us that tuberculosis, fungal infections, scabies, severe malnutrition and chronic digestive issues were common.

El Salvador's criminal justice system has a history of jailing US deportees, which has made their gang violence problem worse:

Sending people into such conditions would not only make the U.S. government complicit in violations of human rights, it would also repeat past mistakes. MS13 and Barrio 18, the brutal gangs that until recently terrorized neighborhoods across El Salvador, were born in part from deportations by the U.S. and from El Salvador's harsh law enforcement practices. Deportations from the U.S. in the 1990s, during the Clinton administration, allowed these gangs to expand.

Mass arrests in the 2000s, which the Salvadoran government characterized as a way to curb the gangs, instead gave gang leaders the time and proximity to strengthen their internal structures in prison and a dehumanized population to recruit from. More U.S. deportations to El Salvador during the 2000s built upon this rotten foundation. Salvadoran authorities often assumed that people deported from the U.S. were members of criminal organizations and subjected many to arrests, torture, beatings, sexual assault, disappearances and killings.

After ordering a wave of military strikes against leaders of the Houthis in Yemen over the weekend, Donald Trump says he will in the future retaliate against Iran for any further attacks by the group.

Iran has long supported the Houthis, who have stepped up attacks on commercial vessels off Yemen's waters in retaliation for Israel's invasion of Gaza. Here's what the president wrote on Truth Social:

Let nobody be fooled! The hundreds of attacks being made by Houthi, the sinister mobsters and thugs based in Yemen, who are hated by the Yemeni people, all emanate from, and are created by, IRAN. Any further attack or retaliation by the “Houthis” will be met with great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there. Iran has played “the innocent victim” of rogue terrorists from which they've lost control, but they haven't lost control. They're dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, “Intelligence.” Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!

Rallies in Yemen following the US attacks have brought tens of thousands of people out on to the streets. We have a live blog covering the reaction, and you can read it here:

Federal judge James Boasberg has scheduled a 5pm hearing for the Trump administration to explain if they defied his order not to deport undocumented immigrants suspected of belonging to a Venezuelan gang.

Planes carrying the migrants arrived in El Salvador after Boasberg's order, and attorneys for some of those deported have argued that it appears the administration willingly defied his instruction that they turn back or refrain from departing the United States. Top administration officials said they disagreed with Boasberg's order, with some reportedly arguing that it did not apply to the aircraft because they were in international airspace when it was handed down.

Russian asylum seekers were once allowed to remain temporarily in the United States while their case was being considered. That's no longer the case, the Guardian's Sofia Sorochinskaia reports:

For most of the four years of Joe Biden was in office, citizens of Russia and other post-Soviet states seeking asylum in the US were generally released into the country while they awaited hearings on their claim in immigration court.

But since last summer, many have been detained upon entering the US, and some of them have been held for more than a year, lawyers, activists and detainees say. Some children have been separated from their parents.

“My Russian clients tell me, ‘Now our prison is 80% Russian, the remaining 20% are from rotating nationalities who stay for a while,'” said immigration attorney Julia Nikolaev, who has been advocating for detainees' rights alongside representatives of the Russian opposition. “Only Russians and a few other post-Soviet nationals remain in detention until their final hearings.”

Alexei Demin, a 62-year-old former naval officer from Moscow, was detained in July of last year.

In the last 20 years, Demin rarely missed an anti-Vladimir Putin protest in the Russian capital. He had become concerned almost immediately after Putin, a former KGB agent, rose to power, he said. For years, he criticized Putin's regime on Facebook, and he was detained twice at protests. Still, he never imagined that he would end up fleeing his homeland for fear that Putin's regime would imprison him. Or that he would end up imprisoned in the US.

Politico has more details about Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) rationale for deporting Rasha Alawieh, a doctor and kidney specialist who was sent to Lebanon despite having a valid US visa.

CBP agents at Boston Logan international airport say Alawieh was found with images of Hezbollah leaders, and acknowledged attending the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Alawieh's case raised concern because it appeared she was deported in violation of a court order that required a judge be given notice before she was removed from the country.

Here's more:

Federal authorities say they deported a Lebanese doctor holding an American visa last week after finding “sympathetic photos and videos” of prominent Hezbollah figures in the deleted items folder of her cell phone.

Rasha Alawieh, a physician specializing in kidney transplants and professor at Brown University, also told Customs and Border Protection agents that while visiting Lebanon last month she attended the funeral of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and supported him “from a religious perspective” but not a political one.

“CBP questioned Dr. Alawieh and determined that her true intentions in the United States could not be determined,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sady wrote in a filing to the court.

The claims in court filings submitted Monday by Justice Department lawyers are the first public explanation of why Alawieh, 34, was deported Friday despite holding a U.S. visa typically issued to foreigners with special skills for a job that an employer claims difficulty finding American candidates to fill.

The assertions about Alawieh's affinity for Hezbollah came shortly before a federal judge was scheduled to hold a hearing Monday on whether the government defied an order he issued Friday requiring that she not be deported without advance notice to the court. U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin postponed the hearing Monday morning just before it was to begin. He gave the government another week to submit further information about what happened with Alawieh.

CBP would never intentionally defy a court order, the government said.

CBP official John Wallace said in a sworn declaration filed with the court that CBP officials at Boston's Logan Airport hadn't received formal notification of the court order through official channels before Alawieh was put on an Air France flight bound for Paris Friday night.

Democracy Forward and the American Civil Liberties Union, who are representing a group of Venezuelans that Donald Trump ordered deported under the Alien Enemies Act, told a federal judge they fear that the government violated his order to keep the migrants in the country while he weighs their case.

In a motion filed today, the two rights groups point to evidence that the government allowed planes carrying alleged gang members, most of whom are from Venezuela, to depart for or continue flying to Central American countries even after federal judge James Boasberg said they should turn back.

“Plaintiffs remain extremely concerned that, regardless of which time is used, the government may have violated the Court's command,” attorneys for the two groups wrote. They continued:

The government states that “some gang members subject to removal under the Proclamation had already been removed from United States territory under the Proclamation before the issuance of this Court's second order … That phrasing strongly suggests that the government has chosen to treat this Court's Order as applying only to individuals still on U.S. soil or on flights that had yet to clear U.S. airspace as of 7:26pm (the time of the written order). If that is how the government proceeded, it was a blatant violation of the Court's Order.

Boasberg is expected to this morning further consider the case in Washington DC federal court.

A major legal showdown is brewing over Donald Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, most of whom are from Venezuela. The law, among the oldest in the United States, has not been used since the second world war, but Trump has argued it is necessary and likened stopping the flow of undocumented immigrants to fighting a war. Here's more about the act, from the Associated Press:

Donald Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since the second world war, granting himself sweeping powers under a centuries-old law to deport people associated with a Venezuelan gang. Hours later, a federal judge halted deportations under the US president's order.

The act is a sweeping wartime authority that allows noncitizens to be deported without being given the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.

Trump's proclamation on Saturday identified Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang as an invading force. US district judge James Boasberg blocked anyone from being deported under the proclamation for two weeks and scheduled a Friday hearing to consider arguments.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

US president says consequences of any future attacks by Yemen's Tehran-backed rebels will be ‘dire'

The US president, Donald Trump, has declared he will hold Iran directly responsible for any future attacks by Yemen's Tehran-backed Houthi rebels, who have targeted US and other foreign ships in the Red Sea.

“Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Monday.

Trump's comments further escalate his administration's new campaign targeting the rebels. Airstrikes killed at least 53 people this weekend and appear poised to continue. Meanwhile, Iran continues to weigh how to respond to a letter Trump sent it last week trying to jump-start negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear programme.

Describing the Houthis as “sinister mobsters and thugs”, Trump warned any attack by the group would be met with “great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there”.

“Iran has played ‘the innocent victim' of rogue terrorists from which they've lost control, but they haven't lost control,” Trump alleged in his post. “They're dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, ‘Intelligence.'”

It is unclear what sparked Trump's post. However, the head of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guards sought to separate the Houthis' actions from those of Tehran this weekend. The Houthis also launched drones and missiles targeting the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, though none reached the ship as it continues flight operations in the region.

Iran did not immediately comment on the post.

Leading figures urge Pam Bondi to examine ‘Mr Musk's activities at the FAA' amid conflict-of-interest concerns

Leading Democrats on Monday demanded an investigation of possible criminal corruption involving Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and world's richest man tasked by Donald Trump with slashing the federal government.

The investigation should involve “the Federal Aviation Administration's decision to cancel a $2.4bn contract with Verizon to upgrade air traffic control communications, and to pay … Musk's Starlink to help manage US airspace”, senators Chris Van Hollen, Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren wrote to Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and Mitch Behm, acting inspector general of the transportation department.

“We ask that the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General and the Department of Justice investigate the scope of Mr Musk's activities at the FAA,” the senators said.

An investigation, the letter said, would determine whether Musk, “in his capacity as a special government employee in the White House … has participated in any particular matter in which he has a financial interest, which would violate the criminal conflict-of-interest statute”.

Sent amid widespread concern over the state of the US air traffic control system under Trump, after a string of crashes and accidents, some fatal, the letter and two others were provided exclusively to the Guardian.

In a lengthy letter to Susie Wiles, Trump's White House chief of staff, the three senators were joined by Jeff Merkley of Oregon and the Maryland congressman Jamie Raskin in citing powers of congressional oversight when they asked to “provide written assurances that [the administration] will immediately remediate the worst” instances of a long list of alleged conflicts of interest and corruption arising from Trump's first two months in power.

A third letter asked Gene Dodaro, the comptroller general, to mount a Government Accountability Office investigation into whether the appointment of former Georgia congressman Doug Collins to run both the US Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of Government Ethics is undermining either body.

Musk's vast wealth has been attained through companies including Tesla, X and SpaceX, which makes Starlink satellite internet technology. Having donated hundreds of millions to Trump's election campaign, he has taken charge of the so-called “department of government efficiency” or Doge, an effort to slash federal budgets and staffing.

Addressing Bondi and Behm, the Democrats said that as a special government employee, Musk should be “subject to federal conflict-of-interest rules” and “may be using his government role to benefit his own private company”.

Citing the Washington Post, Bloomberg News, and Rolling Stone, the Democrats said: “Reports indicate that some personnel of SpaceX, Starlink's parent company, have already begun working at the FAA.

“Additionally, Starlink has begun shipping its hardware to the FAA, though the company has stated that it is providing satellite kits to the agency free of charge. However, sources suggest that the FAA is ordering staff to ‘begin finding tens of millions of dollars for a Starlink deal.'”

SpaceX has called reports about its FAA dealings “false”, adding: “Starlink is a possible partial fix to an aging system. There is no effort or intent for Starlink to ‘take over' any existing contract – that's just FUD”, meaning “fear, uncertainty, and doubt”.

In February, in a joint Oval Office appearance with Trump, Musk said: “All of our actions are fully public. So, if you see anything you say like, wait a second, hey, you know what … that seems like maybe that's, you know, that there's a conflict there, it's not like people are going to be shy about saying that. They'll say it immediately.”

Trump said that if he thought Musk might have a conflict, “we would not let him do that segment or look in that area”.

Allegations of corruption and conflicts of interest involving Trump are legion, ever since he entered politics in 2015.

In their letter to Wiles, the Democrats said: “Despite President Trump's promises to fight for working families, he has appointed a string of corporate billionaires and industry insiders, putting them in positions to enrich themselves at the expense of ordinary Americans.”

Last week, Trump used the White House lawn to attempt to drive customers to a Musk business, Tesla, which has seen its share price slump amid unease over Musk's cost-cutting and outrage over behavior including giving Nazi-style salutes and abusing US allies.

Calling Musk Trump's “unelected ‘co-president'”, the Democrats accused him of “relentlessly attacking and disarming federal agencies that regulate his companies, even as his companies have benefited from billions in federal contracts”.

Saying “corruption scandals were a feature of President Trump's first term”, the Democrats listed potential scandals in the second, including appointing lobbyists to roles overseeing their own industries and allowing other appointees to give investments in their own sectors to their adult children.”

Instances cited included Trump boosting his own social media platform and ventures in cryptocurrency; continuing to seek expand his foreign and domestic real estate holdings, including an attempt to buy back the former Trump Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue; and using his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida as “a well-oiled pay-to-play machine”.

The Democrats noted Trump's firing of the director of the Office of Government Ethics, a first in US history, and his dismissal of “at least 17 inspectors general”, independent department watchdogs, without notifying Congress as required; and his attempt to fire the head of the Office of Special Counsel.

But despite it all, the Democrats said, Trump's decision to “cede power” to Musk remained his most concerning move.

“Since President Trump took office,” the Democrats told Wiles, “at least 11 … agencies with ‘investigations, pending complaints or enforcement actions' against Musk's companies have been hamstrung, including through the firing of the agencies' independent commissioners and rolling back the agencies' independence.

“Meanwhile, Musk's companies – which have already received at least $38bn in federal funding – are vying for new federal contracts.”

The letter also raised a mooted purchase of Tesla vehicles by the state department and Musk's attempt to buy OpenAI while “insisting that agencies increase their reliance on artificial intelligence”.

“Musk has done all of this without so much as disclosing his financial interests to the public,” the Democrats said.

The Democrats said Trump could still take steps “to reverse course and put our national interests ahead of his personal dealings”. Such steps included reinstating fired watchdogs, vetting nominees for conflicts of interest, and revoking Musk's “power to profit from his efforts to manipulate the executive branch for his own benefit”, while being required “to promptly release his financial disclosure form so that the public can understand his potential conflicts of interest”.

Setting a deadline of 31 March, the Democrats asked Wiles to answer six questions.

Will Trump, they asked, reinstate “all government watchdogs he has purportedly fired and … protect their independence from political interference”; commit not to “appoint additional officials [with] direct conflicts of interest that cannot be resolved … under existing ethics law”; “issue an ethics pledge” for new nominees; “commit to divest from his private business interests, as every prior president in the modern era has done”; “commit to disclose his tax returns from the past three years”; and require Musk “to publicly release his financial disclosure form”?

Trump, Musk and Wiles did not immediately comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

People suspected of involvement in 2024 Vilnius attack also accused of links to crimes in Poland

Lithuanian prosecutors have blamed the Russian military intelligence service for being behind an arson attack on an Ikea store in Vilnius last year, calling it “an act of terrorism”.

Lithuania, a Nato member, has been a staunch ally of Ukraine since Moscow invaded in February 2022, and has frequently warned of Russian sabotage attempts.

On Monday, the Lithuanian prosecutor general's office attributed the arson attack in Vilnius in May 2024 to Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU.

There were no casualties, but the prosecutor Arturas Urbelis told reporters: “We regard this act as an act of terrorism with serious consequences.”

Two Ukrainian citizens were suspects in the Ikea arson case, with one being detained in Lithuania and the other in Poland, he added.

“It has been established that through a series of intermediaries … the organisers of these crimes are in Russia and this is connected to military intelligence and security forces,” Urbelis said.

The prosecutor's office said the person detained in Lithuania was suspected of having entered Poland in spring 2024.

“During a secret meeting in Warsaw, he and another person agreed to set fire to and blow up shopping centres in Lithuania and Latvia for a reward of €10,000 (nearly $11,000),” the office said in a statement.

“More than one supermarket has been set on fire, and not just supermarkets,” Urbelis said when asked about whether the arson was linked to similar cases in neighbouring Poland.

“It is obvious that the persons we have identified, the perpetrators and the intermediaries, are also linked to the criminal acts committed in Poland,” he added.

Poland was currently investigating about 30 alleged acts of preparation or commission of sabotage, the authorities said.

The Polish prosecutor Przemyslaw Nowak said: “After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we have indeed observed an increase in the activity of foreign services in Poland, including primarily the services of Russia.”

“Unfortunately, we have evidence that in Poland, and not only in Poland, there are several organised groups that plan and carry out acts of sabotage,” he added.

Commenting on Lithuania's findings, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said it was “exceptionally perfidious” for Russia to hire Ukrainians as perpetrators of sabotage acts.

“Dear allies, the investigation of the Lithuanian prosecutor's office has confirmed our suspicions that responsible for setting fires to shopping centres in Vilnius and Warsaw are the Russian secret services,” he said on X.

“Good to know before negotiations. Such is the nature of this state,” he added, referring to potential talks on war-torn Ukraine's fate.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Research shows dramatic reversal of decades of net outflow to Israel, as new arrivals bring cultural influences

Israelis making a new home in Europe have become vital to previously declining Jewish communities on the continent, boosting numbers, bringing a range of cultural influences and marking a fundamental change in the relationship between the diaspora and the Jewish state, research has revealed.

A report released on Wednesday by the London-based Institute for Jewish Policy Research will detail for the first time a dramatic reversal of decades of net outflow to Israel from Jewish communities in Europe.

“We can say that culturally and demographically there is a real turning point. Possibly the end of an era,” said Dr Daniel Staetsky, the report's author. “The founders of the state of Israel would never have imagined that it would be Israel that would be rejuvenating European Jewish communities, not the other way around.”

Recent Israeli government statistics show accelerating emigration from Israel, driven by factors including political polarisation, the high cost of living, the impact of wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and security concerns after the bloody Hamas raid into Israel of October 2023 and Iranian attacks.

The biggest destination remains the US but many of Europe's Jewish communities have also received a significant demographic boost, with some that have been shrinking for decades due to an elderly population and a low birthrate now growing again.

Researchers at the IJPR found about 630,000 Jewish people born in Israel or who had lived there for a significant time are now living elsewhere in the world. There are also about 330,000 people born overseas to one or two parents who are Israeli nationals whom the report described as “Israel-connected”.

The researchers used new government statistics to establish a definitive figure for Germany's Israeli and Israeli-connected Jewish population after decades of only rough estimates. At 24,000 this was higher than previously thought, making the Israeli-connected community in Germany the biggest in Europe.

Nearly half of the Jewish population in Norway was Israel-connected, the report said, as well as 41% in Finland, and more than 20% of Jewish communities in Bulgaria, Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark.

Jonathan Boyd, the JPR's director, said the new arrivals were having a big impact. “In the UK there are about 23,000 Israel-born people. That's close to twice as many as 20 years ago but among a total Jewish population of an estimated 313,000. In the smaller countries such as the Netherlands the influx can have a much bigger impact. In Norway or Finland it only takes a few to settle to make a big difference.”

“Wherever they go Israelis bring something with them. They bring aspects of day-to-day Israeli culture into these countries.”

The use of Hebrew and Israeli names for children has become more widespread in many Jewish communities in Europe and cuisine based on eastern European traditions is being replaced by contemporary Israeli cooking in some places.

Close to 12,000 people from Israel and their children now live in the Netherlands.

“There are a lot of Israelis here now and that is changing the composition of the Jewish community,” said Asjer Waterman, a strategic adviser at JMW, the national welfare organisation for the Dutch Jewish community. “Of course they have a different identity and history to Dutch Jews.”

Itay Garmy, a councillor in Amsterdam born in the Netherlands whose father was Israeli, said the Israeli community in the city was often more secular than the historic Jewish community, which “was already pretty secular”.

“Our connection with Israel is more based on culture than faith. It's more about music, food and love of Israel as a second home for Jewish people than religion,” said Garmy, 31.

Other Israeli immigrants have found a new interest in religion after moving overseas.

“Until a year ago I regarded myself as Israeli but recently I am feeling more my Jewish identity,” said Avisar Lev, who moved to Berlin from Tel Aviv in 2012.

Lev said he had not personally experienced any antisemitism, which EU data suggests has risen sharply in recent years, and is widely reported in Israel.

Many of the arrivals from Israel are well educated, relatively young and have children in their new homes.

Official statistics in Israel show that emigration from Israel was nearly 83,000 in 2024, more than double the number between 2009 and 2021, and higher than 2022. Population growth was down from 1.6% to 1.1%, even though about 33,000 people arrived from other countries and 23,000 Israelis returned.

A parliamentary committee last month attributed the decline to “a significant increase in negative migration amid the complex security situation”, and called for a reform of lengthy and bureaucratic immigration processes.

The emigration has prompted concern in the Israeli media. A recent editorial in the Yedioth Ahronoth daily newspaper was entitled: “It's no wonder people are leaving Israel”. Others have warned of a “brain drain”.

Last year, Prof Aaron Ciechanover, one of Israel's leading scientists, blamed efforts by the current government to introduce controversial judicial changes for the rise in departures. Those leaving “want to live in a free, liberal-democratic country, and not in a country where the government is forcibly taking power,” Ciechanover said.

The IJPR report was about the impact on Jewish communities of the new migration and therefore focused on Jewish Israelis, not Arab Israelis.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Communist party aims to ‘promote reasonable wage growth' and to reduce financial burdens amid Trump tariffs

China's government has announced ambitious plans to “vigorously boost consumption” by putting up pay and reducing financial burdens, in its latest attempt to increase consumer confidence and lift its struggling economy.

The plans, announced by the ruling Chinese Communist party's (CCP) central committee and state council on Sunday, include aims to “promote reasonable wage growth” and to improve the mechanisms for adjusting the minimum wage.

It also proposed bringing in subsidies for childcare (a financial burden cited by young adults as discouraging them from having children), unlocking earnings potential for homeowners, promoting “emerging” markets such as AI-powered products and encouraging snow and ice tourism.

“By connecting consumer spending to broader social goals like elderly care improvement, childcare support and work-life balance, the plan embeds consumption growth within China's wider development objectives, signalling that consumption is being positioned not just as an economic target but as a means to enhance quality of life,” said a report in the official state media outlet, Xinhua.

Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for the national bureau of statistics, told reporters on Monday that the economy was moving in the right direction but domestic and international challenges remained.

“The external environment has become more complex and grim, domestic effective demand is insufficient, some companies are facing difficulties in production and operation, and the foundation for the continuous recovery of the economy is still unstable,” Fu said.

The announcement came several days after the end of China's Two Sessions political meeting, in which the CCP had set an expected 5% growth target for the economy. The announcement came after data revealed consumer prices had dropped into deflation last month for the first time in a year.

The fresh measures lifted many Asia-Pacific stock markets on Monday, and stocks in South Korea, Hong Kong and Australia closed higher. Mainland Chinese investors, however, were less enthusiastic, and the blue-chip CSI 300 closed 0.2% down.

The plan came amid mixed domestic economic data from Beijing, as reports showed retail spending was up compared with last year, but unemployment had hit its highest level in two years and house prices had fallen in almost all medium and large cities.

“In the first two months, with the sustained effects of macro policies, the national economy maintained the new and positive development,” the national bureau of statistics said, but it added that domestic effective demand was weak.

“The foundation for sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough,” it said.

China's government said the economy hit its growth target of 5% in 2024, but it was still the country's slowest rate since 1990, bar the pandemic. The economy has been dragged down by a property market crisis, lingering low spending from the pandemic and record rates of youth unemployment in recent years.

In November the government announced 10tn yuan (£1.1tn) in debt support for local governments, but has largely shied away from the big stimulus measures that analysts say are needed.

The country is facing a protracted trade war with the US, as Donald Trump flags further expanding tariffs on Chinese exports, and potentially putting pressure on other countries to place their own levies.

“The risk to the economy is the damage from higher US tariffs on China's exports which will likely show up in the trade data over the next few months,” Zhiwei Zhang, the president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, told the news agency AFP.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Planned missiles on Kyushu said to be part of ‘counterstrike capabilities', as fears grow over US security pact

Japan is planning to deploy long-range missiles on its southern island of Kyushu amid concerns around the Trump administration's stance towards its security pacts and continuing regional tensions.

The missiles, with a range of about 1,000km, would be capable of hitting targets in North Korea and China's coastal regions, and are due to be deployed next year in two bases with existing missile garrisons. They would bolster the defences of the strategically important Okinawa island chain and are part of Japan's development of “counterstrike capabilities” in the event it is attacked, according to reports from Kyodo News agency, citing government sources.

Deployment of long-range missiles on the Okinawa islands, which stretch to within 110km of Taiwan, is unlikely to happen, to avoid provoking China. The islands already house a number of missiles batteries with shorter ranges.

“As the threat from the China and North Korea has been mounting, it is natural for Japan to counter this with more effective weapons systems,” said Yoichi Shimada, professor emeritus at Fukui Prefectural University. “I think Japan should rapidly take measures such as the deployment of longer-range missiles to develop more robust security.”

On 6 March, the US president, Donald Trump, complained that the Japan-US security treaty was nonreciprocal: “We have a great relationship with Japan, but we have an interesting deal with Japan that we have to protect them, but they don't have to protect us,” adding, “That's the way the deal reads … and by the way, they make a fortune with us economically. I actually ask who makes these deals?”

The treaty was first signed in 1951, when Japan was still occupied by US forces. Japan's ability to take military action is restricted by the pacifist article 9 of its constitution, which was effectively imposed on it by Washington after the second world war.

Shimada believes that “proactive measures” such as boosting its missile systems will strengthen US-Japan ties, and that “demands from the Trump administration for reciprocal defence arrangements with Japan are not so unreasonable”.

However, Trump's pronouncements on allies and fellow Nato members, including Canada and Denmark, have some in Japan concerned about his administration's commitment to honouring longstanding treaties, according to Robert Dujarric of Temple University in Tokyo.

“It is clear to anyone who is watching this carefully that the US-Japan alliance is in bad shape,” said Dujarric. “Even if China attacked Japan, there is no guarantee that the US under Trump would do anything. That is a big problem.”

Two ground self-defense force (GSDF) bases are being considered for the new missiles, Camp Yufuin in Oita, and Camp Kengun in Kumamoto, both on Kyushu and already home to missile batteries. The new weapon systems are reported to be upgraded versions of the GSDF's Type-12 land-to-ship guided missiles.

“This is just one part of a gradual increase in Japanese military capacity,” said Dujarric, who believes the country “needs to rethink its security policy” in light of the shifting geopolitical landscape.

Despite having been largely taboo in the 80 years since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, if Japan feels it can no longer rely on US military support, that would “spark debate as to whether to acquire nuclear weapons”, suggested Dujarric.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Portions of eastern US under watch for dangerous winds and tornadoes as storm moves out on Sunday

Portions of Pennsylvania, New York, and mid-Atlantic and south-east states were still under a National Weather Service watch for damaging wind and tornadoes, as the death toll from weekend storms rose to 36 people across six states.

In a White House statement, Donald Trump said he was monitoring the tornadoes and storms, adding that “36 innocent lives have been lost, and many more devastated”.

Trump announced that the national guard had been deployed to Arkansas and pledged help to state and local officials.

The storms that hit the south and the midwest headed east on Sunday. More than 340,000 consumers had no power in the affected areas as of late afternoon on Sunday, according to the website PowerOutage.

Missouri reported the largest number of deaths, 12 fatalities spanning five counties, the state's highway patrol posted on social media. Missouri's governor, Mike Kehoe, said there was still one person missing in the state, which saw widespread destruction across 27 counties.

Robbie Myers, director of emergency management in Missouri's Butler county, told reporters that more than 500 homes, a church and a grocery store in the county were destroyed. A mobile home park had been “totally destroyed”, he said.

“Everything around it here is really bad,” Missouri resident Rick Brittingham told Reuters from Butler county. “The trailer park up the street had fatalities. So, I mean, we don't have nothing compared to anything like that. I still have a home. They don't.”

Mississippi's governor, Tate Reeves, posted on social media that six deaths had been reported in the state – one in Covington county, two in Jefferson Davis county and three in Walthall county.

According to preliminary assessments, 29 people were injured statewide and 21 counties sustained storm damage, Reeves said.

Hailey Hart and her fiance, Steve Romero, hunkered down with their three huskies inside their 1994 Toyota Celica as a tornado ripped apart their home on Saturday in Tylertown, Mississippi.

Romero said he prayed out loud and hugged Hart as the car rolled on to its side, windows shattering, before it landed on its wheels again. After the twister passed, they could hear people nearby screaming for help.

“It was a bad dream come true,” Romero said.

Next door, Hart's grandparents crawled out from the rubble of their destroyed house after they sought shelter in a bathroom as falling trees collapsed the roof.

“Everything was coming down on us,” said Donna Blansett, Hart's grandmother. “All I could do was pray to God to save us.”

They escaped with just a few scratches and aches. Family members, friends and volunteers spent Sunday removing debris and salvaging anything they could find – some damp clothes, a photo album and a few toiletries.

“I'm so happy you're alive,” Hart said through tears, as she embraced her grandmother on Sunday.

The National Weather Service said tornado watches had mostly expired, but dangerous winds were still possible in the Carolinas, east Georgia and northern Florida through Sunday evening.

In Arkansas, three deaths occurred, the state's department of emergency management said, adding that there were 32 injuries.

Eight deaths were confirmed in a crash involving more than 50 cars in Sherman county in Kansas caused by a severe dust storm, the Kansas highway patrol said in a statement. Many injured travelers were taken to local hospitals.

At least two people died in Alabama due to the severe weather, the state's governor, Kay Ivey, said in a social media post. “We have reports of damage in 52 of our 67 counties,” she said.

Crashes caused by dust storms near Amarillo, Texas, resulted in three deaths, according to the state's department of public safety.

Wind-driven wildfires caused extensive damage in Texas and Oklahoma, and officials warned on Sunday that parts of both states would again face an increased risk of fire danger in the coming week.

More than 130 fires were reported across Oklahoma and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed, the state's governor, Kevin Stitt, said.

“Nobody has enough resources to fight fires when the wind is blowing 70mph,” said Terry Essary, the fire chief of Stillwater, Oklahoma. “It's an insurmountable task.”

Oklahoma department of emergency management spokesperson Keli Cain said on Sunday that two people were killed as a result of the wildfires and weather.

Thirty-nine tornadoes were reported from Friday to midday on Sunday, but the number was not yet confirmed, according to the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Ruling coalition continues its crackdown on LGBTQ+ people under its ‘child protection' legislation

Hungary's ruling coalition is continuing its crackdown on the country's LGBTQ+ community, as members submitted a bill to parliament that would ban the popular Budapest Pride event and allow authorities to use facial recognition software to identify people attending.

The bill, presented on Monday, is almost certain to pass as the coalition has a two-thirds majority in parliament.

It would make it an offence to hold or attend events that violate Hungary's contentious “child protection” legislation, which prohibits the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality to under-18s.

Attending a prohibited event would carry fines of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints (£420), which the state would forward to “child protection”.

Pride organisers have called the prime minister Viktor Orbán's drive to ban the event a restriction of fundamental freedoms of speech and assembly.

The proposal is the latest step against LGBTQ+ people taken by the government, which has passed legislation that rights groups and other European politicians have decried as repressive.

The government portrays itself as a champion of traditional family values and a defender of Christian civilisation from what it calls “gender madness”, and says its policies are designed to protect children from “sexual propaganda”.

Hungary's “child protection” law was passed in 2021. Aside from banning the “depiction or promotion” of homosexuality in content available to minors – including in television, films, advertisements and literature – it also prohibits the mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programmes, and forbids the public depiction of “gender deviating from sex at birth”.

In a speech in February, Orbán hinted that his government would take steps to ban Budapest Pride, which attracts thousands of participants and celebrates the history of the LGBTQ+ movement while asserting the equal rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.

Budapest Pride will mark its 30th anniversary this year.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

UK pharma group acquires Belgium's EsoBiotec as it announces EU has approved Imfinzi lung cancer drug

AstraZeneca has struck a $1bn (£773m) deal to buy a Belgian biotech company that specialises in cancer immunotherapies, the latest in a string of acquisitions that also yielded positive results for a late-stage rare disease drug on Monday.

EsoBiotec, a small privately held firm, develops in-vivo CAR-T cell therapies that empower the immune system to attack cancers, and could offer many more patients access to cell therapy treatments, provided in minutes rather than weeks.

The deal marks the latest acquisition by AstraZeneca, which is Britain's biggest listed company valued at £184bn, as the pharmaceutical group continues to expand its global operations. Its share price fell by 1.2% on Monday afternoon.

EsoBiotec's approach uses highly targeted lentiviruses to deliver genetic instructions to specific immune cells, such as T-cells, which program them to recognise and destroy tumour cells for cancer treatment, or tackle autoreactive cells (that target the body's own tissues or cells) for potential use in autoimmune diseases. This means cell therapies can be given through a simple injection.

The EsoBiotec chief executive, Jean-Pierre Latere, described them as “cost-effective, off-the-shelf therapies” that engineer immune cells within the patient's body. “It's super-effective. Effectively it turns the patient into a factory,” he said.

He founded the business four years ago after serving as chief operating officer of the Belgian biotech company Celyad Oncology and working for the US chemical producer Dow Corning, having begun his career as a senior scientist at the US drugmaker Johnson & Johnson.

EsoBiotec, which is based in Mont-Saint-Guibert in Walloon Brabant, is backed by Benelux investment groups Thuja Capital, UCB Ventures, Wallonie Entreprendre, Sambrinvest and Investsud, and Spain's Invivo Partners.

The company's approach is much quicker and less complicated than traditional cell therapies, where cells are taken from a patient, genetically modified outside the body, and then put back into the patient as a medicine after immune cell depletion. This can take three to five weeks and costs $450,000 to $500,00 for each treatment.

Susan Galbraith, the executive vice-president of oncology research and development at AstraZeneca, said the company had been “looking for things out of the ordinary” and negotiated the deal quickly after seeing EsoBiotec present data from its first patient at JP Morgan's healthcare conference in San Francisco in mid-January. In December, the Belgian group launched a clinical trial for its lead product for multiple myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer.

Galbraith added: “We believe it has the potential to transform cell therapy and will enable us to scale these innovative treatments so that many more patients around the world can access them.”

She said only 10% to 20% of people who could benefit from cell therapy can obtain it at the moment because clinics in many countries are not set up for the weeks-long process, whereas EsoBiotec's technology means treatments can be given as a simple infusion “at a fraction” of the cost of traditional cures. If trials show it works, it could ease the pressure on health systems including the NHS.

AstraZeneca, which fended off a hostile £69bn takeover approach from the US drugmaker Pfizer in 2014, will pay $425m initially for the Belgian drug developer, and up to $575m based on development and regulatory milestones.

Emily Field, European pharmaceuticals analyst at Barclays, described the latest deal as a “sensible bolt-on in cell therapy, with preliminary but promising data on seven patients”.

It builds on other investments, and means AstraZeneca has seven cell therapy programmes in its pipeline, including one for multiple myeloma acquired with China's Gracell Biotechnologies in a $1.2bn deal in late 2023.

AstraZeneca's biggest deal was the $39bn acquisition of the US rare disease drug developer Alexion in 2020, but it was criticised for paying a high price. Marc Dunoyer, who runs the division and is AstraZeneca's chief strategy officer, defended the deal as a “fantastic acquisition” last month when the company took a $753m hit for scrapping one of the Alexion drugs, while two other medicines from the acquisition have also been abandoned.

Separately, Britain's biggest pharmaceutical company said on Monday that its Imfinzi treatment had been approved in the EU as the first and only immunotherapy for patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer, whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.

AstraZeneca also announced that a drug for a rare endocrine disease, hypoparathyroidism, which can lead to bone density loss and osteoporosis, had met its goal of normalising calcium levels in the blood after 24 weeks. It was well tolerated by patients, and the trial continues as planned to 52 weeks. The company acquired the medicine along with the French rare disease specialist Amolyt Pharma in a deal worth more than $1bn a year ago.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Trump says negotiators have already discussed ‘dividing up certain assets' and that he will talk to Putin on Tuesday

Donald Trump is to speak to Vladimir Putin on Tuesday – with the two expected to discuss territory and control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – after the Russian president last week pushed back on a US-brokered plan for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine with a series of sweeping conditions he said would need to be met.

The Kremlin confirmed on Monday that the two leaders were due to speak by phone, after Trump's statement that he planned to discuss with Putin ending the war in Ukraine. The US president also said that negotiators had already talked about “dividing up certain assets”, including power stations.

“I'll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday. A lot of work's been done over the weekend,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a flight back to the Washington area from Florida.

“We want to see if we can bring that war to an end. Maybe we can, maybe we can't, but I think we have a very good chance,” Trump said.

US and Russian officials have engaged in discussions about Ukraine in recent weeks, with talks accelerating after Washington and Kyiv agreed on a proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire last week.

Nevertheless, Putin in effect rejected the plan, instead outlining a series of conditions, including a halt to Ukraine's rearmament and mobilisation, as well as a suspension of western military aid to Kyiv during the 30-day ceasefire. He also renewed calls for broader negotiations on a long-term settlement to the war.

Ukraine, which has agreed to the truce, accused Putin of seeking to prolong the war. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine's president, has also consistently said the sovereignty of his country is not negotiable and that Russia must surrender the territory it has seized.

Trump said: “We will be talking about land. We will be talking about power plants.”

The US president did not elaborate, but he was most likely referring to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, the largest in Europe. He said: “I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We are already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.”

The White House gave no further details during a press briefing on Monday, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said “there's a power plant that is on the border of Russia and Ukraine that was up for discussion with the Ukrainians, and he (Trump) will address it in his call with Putin tomorrow.” Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is not on the Russia-Ukraine border, but in Ukrainian territory which was seized by Russia early in the war.

Trump's comments came hours after his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said that the Russian president “accepts the philosophy” of Trump's ceasefire and peace terms.

Witkoff told CNN that discussions with Putin over several hours last week had been “positive” and “solution-based”.

But he declined to confirm when asked whether Putin's demands included the surrender of Ukrainian forces in Kursk, international recognition of Ukrainian territory seized by Russia as Russian, limits on Ukraine's ability to mobilise, a halt to western military aid, and a ban on foreign peacekeepers.

The UK on Monday said a so-called “coalition of the willing” had now expanded beyond 30 countries willing to help with guarantees for a post-ceasefire Ukraine, with a “significant” number of those countries prepared to provide troops.

A Downing Street spokesperson said: “Obviously the contribution capabilities will vary, but this will be a significant force, with a significant number of countries providing troops and a larger group contributing in other ways.”

David Lammy later told parliament that the gathering of G7 foreign ministers in Canada last week had pledged to keep up the pressure on Russia to agree to the ceasefire.

The UK foreign secretary told MPs: “Now it is Putin who stands in the spotlight; Putin who must answer; Putin, who must choose. Are you serious, Mr Putin, about peace? Will you stop the fighting, or will you drag your feet and play games, play lip service to a ceasefire while still pummelling Ukraine?”

If so, Lammy said, the UK and other nations would respond. He said: “We are not waiting for the Kremlin if they reject a ceasefire. We have more cards that we can play.”

Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, on Monday criticised Putin's negotiation tactics ahead of a meeting of the bloc's foreign ministers. “What Russia has put forward makes it clear they don't truly want peace. They are setting their ultimate war objectives as preconditions.”

Kallas is to visit London on Tuesday for talks, Lammy said, adding: “In this moment, Ukraine's friends should be working hand in glove, and that requires a new era in UK-EU security cooperation.”

Emmanuel Macron, the French president, on Sunday said Russia's permission was not needed for peacekeepers to deploy to Ukraine, noting that Ukraine was a sovereign state. “If Ukraine requests allied forces to be on its territory, it is not up to Russia to accept or reject them,” he said in remarks quoted by several French newspapers.

Russia's deputy foreign minister, Alexander Grushko, also on Sunday said that any long-lasting peace treaty on Ukraine must meet Moscow's demands and foreign troops deployed to Ukraine as peacekeepers would be considered by Russia to be combatants.

Regarding the possibility of European troops in Ukraine, he said: “It does not matter under what label Nato contingents were to be deployed on Ukrainian territory: be it the European Union, Nato, or in a national capacity … If they appear there, it means that they are deployed in the conflict zone with all the consequences for these contingents as parties to the conflict.

Meanwhile, the US Department of Justice has notified European officials that the US is withdrawing from a multinational taskforce established to investigate leaders behind the invasion of Ukraine, including Putin.

The Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the International Center for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine, which the US joined under Joe Biden in 2023, signals the latest shift in the unprecedented warming relations between Moscow and Washington. The US previously voted against a UN resolution drafted by Ukraine and the European Union condemning Russia on the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion.

On Monday, Russia also welcomed Trump's decision to cut funding for Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, two US-funded news organisations that broadcast to audiences in authoritarian states. The Kremlin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described the media outlets as “propagandistic, purely propagandistic”.

In February last year, Russia designated Radio Free Europe as an “undesirable organisation”, a move that effectively bans an organisation outright and creates problems for anyone who interacts with it","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Economic organisation downgrades forecasts for growth in UK as well as US, Canada and Mexico due to tariffs

Donald Trump's trade wars are splintering the global economy and unpicking progress made to reboot growth and tackle inflation, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has said.

In its latest update on the health of the world economy, the leading Paris-based institution downgraded the prospects for global growth this year and next, including a sharp hit to activity in the US, Canada and Mexico.

The OECD cut its forecast for UK growth by 0.3 percentage points this year to 1.4%, and by 0.1 percentage points for 2026 to 1.2%, underscoring the challenge for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, before next week's spring statement.

The body representing the world's richest economies said recent higher levels of economic growth and progress to bring down inflation was being undermined by the fallout from higher trade barriers and mounting geopolitical uncertainty.

Cutting its global growth forecast for this year from 3.3% to 3.1%, it said that significant risks still remained. The global economy grew by 3.2% in 2024.

Higher and broader increases in trade barriers would hit growth and add to inflation, while a climbdown would help reduce uncertainty and strengthen activity.

“Significant risks remain. Further fragmentation of the global economy is a key concern. Higher and broader increases in trade barriers would hit growth around the world and add to inflation,” the OECD said in its interim economic outlook report.

The OECD said: “Governments need to find ways of addressing their concerns together within the global trading system to avoid a significant ratcheting-up of retaliatory trade barriers between countries …

“A broad-based further increase in trade restrictions would have significant negative impacts on living standards.”

Basing its projections on the assumption that Trump pushes ahead with plans to impose 25% tariffs on almost all merchandise imports from Canada and Mexico from April, the OECD said activity would be hit and inflation stoked across all three economies.

It said Mexico would be pushed into a deep recession this year – with output shrinking by 1.3% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026 – and almost halved its forecasts for growth in Canada.

It reduced its US growth forecasts from 2.5% to 2.2% for this year and from 2.1% to 1.6% in 2026. Growth in China is projected to slow from 4.8% this year to 4.4% in 2026.

In its first report since Trump's return to the White House in January, the OECD said a further escalation of trade tensions would cause significantly more damage for the world economy.

In a scenario in which 10% blanket tariffs were imposed on all US imports – a threat Trump made on the campaign trail before last November's election – with a matched response from all trading partners, it said global output could fall by 0.3% within three years relative to its current forecast. The US would be hit significantly, with output declining by 0.7% by the third year and inflation rising by an average 0.7 percentage points a year.

Canada and Mexico would also be affected significantly, reflecting their comparatively open economies and high exposure to the downturn in demand in the US and elsewhere.

With the UK government on the back foot on the economy before next week's spring statement, Reeves said the OECD report showed the world was already changing in response to mounting trade uncertainty.

“Increased global headwinds such as trade uncertainty are being felt across the board. A changing world means Britain must change too, and we are delivering a new era of stability, security and renewal, to protect working people and keep our country safe,” Reeves said. 
 “This means we can better respond to global uncertainty, with the UK forecast to be Europe's fastest-growing G7 economy over the coming years – second only to the US.”

The downbeat OECD assessment comes before an expected UK growth downgrade from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent Treasury watchdog, due alongside next week's spring statement.

The OBR had previously expected growth of 2% this year and 1.8% in 2026, but official figures and business surveys have since shown output skirting close to zero amid weakness in business and consumer confidence.

Highlighting the pressure on households and the challenge for the government and the Bank of England, the OECD held its predictions for UK inflation at 2.7% this year and 2.3% in 2026.

Last month, the Bank halved its own UK growth forecast for 2025 – from 1.5% to 0.75% because of weakness in household and business confidence. On Friday, official figures showed the UK economy contracted by 0.1% in January.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The physical impact alone has been seismic, but has the pandemic also altered how we see ourselves and the world?

In the strange, scary days of early 2020, with the world suddenly upended by the outbreak of a terrifying new virus, there were times when it seemed certain every aspect of society would be hugely altered by the experience.

Five years on, the physical impact of Covid has been profound. More than 220,000 people have died in the UK, out of 7 million worldwide. Many more have been left with a devastating post-viral illness.

But how did it change the way we think? Did it alter how we see ourselves, and our relationships with others and the rest of the world?

Amid the fear, social isolation and politicisation of the pandemic, conspiracy theories were born and polarisation appeared to grow. Yet experts trying to piece together the lasting impact that Covid has had on our social norms believe it may have merely accelerated worrying but existing trends of distrust and disillusionment, while some of the potentially unifying forces that the virus spawned have proved more fleeting.

While the evidence for how Covid has shaped social attitudes requires careful interpretation, research data can offer some insights.

Take the question of trust in politics. Comparing attitudes of political confidence in the five-year period from 2019 to 2024 – before the pandemic and after it – the British Social Attitudes survey published last year found levels of trust in government in the UK were as low as they had ever been. A record 45% told the survey they would “almost never” trust a government of any party to place the country above their party.

And 58% would “almost never” trust any politician to tell the truth when they are in a tight corner. More than two-thirds – 69% – agreed or agreed strongly with the assertion: “I don't think the government cares much what people like me think.” In 2014 that figure was 53%.

People who have less trust in their government are more open to considering different ways of doing things, as perhaps has been reflected in some of the political turbulence of recent years. Nearly 80% believed the present way of governing Britain could be improved “quite a lot” or “a great deal”, the BSA found. A record 53% supported changing the electoral system to be more representative of minority parties.

In the longer term, there is evidence of a decrease in confidence in democracy itself. Asked in 2023 how well they thought democracy worked in Britain, 33% said poorly and 43% said well; 10 years earlier, just 15% said poorly and 57% thought it worked well.

But Covid was not the only shock of a tumultuous period in the UK that also witnessed a tortuous Brexit, a cost of living crisis and two prime ministers being ousted from office. Nor did the pandemic invent social atomisation, scepticism of authority or division. Covid is certainly not the only factor shaping attitudes in recent years, say experts. Some believe it may not even be the most significant.

“At the time I felt the pandemic was absolutely one of those disruptions that was going to shape our future,” says Bobby Duffy, a professor of public policy and director of the Policy Institute at King's College London. “But looking at it now, [what we see] is that it has reinforced and accelerated existing trends that we've been seeing for a long, long time.”

There has long been evidence, for example, of disillusionment and increased social atomisation, Duffy says. On the question of whether older generations believe their children will have a better life than they did, the financial crisis of 2008-09 was potentially a more significant event than Covid, he says, with research showing this was a point when optimism in the future dramatically slumped.

Jennie Bristow, a reader in sociology at Canterbury Christ Church University who has written widely about the impact of the pandemic on young people, agrees that it “brought to a head many of the trends that were already happening. Covid didn't create adolescent mental ill health, for instance. It didn't suddenly bring about major mistrust in institutions.”

But unlike Duffy, her view is that the pandemic had an unprecedented impact on our thinking, not least because of the hugely restrictive responses it provoked. Bristow argues that while lockdowns were imposed with the aim of saving lives, one net effect was to formalise and embed social isolation – with all its negative consequences.

This has led to distrust of other people, particularly young people, as “germs on legs”, she says. The intense focus on obeying the rules also bred a more general mutual suspicion, she argues. “Everyone had their own version of the rules they were following, and they were [criticising] people who they thought were breaking them if they were doing something different. So there was that distrust of each other in society.”

That deepening distrust arguably had other consequences. From the earliest days of the pandemic, conspiracy theories spread among a small but committed minority, warning of the purported danger of 5G phone masts and claiming a future vaccine would involve microchips being implanted in people at the behest of Bill Gates.

Though easily debunked, these conspiracy theories have endured, mutated and spawned others. Conspiratorial thoughts around vaccines have proved remarkably enduring: in January 2021, as the vaccine rollout began in Britain, 75% of UK adults told YouGov it was definitely or probably false that vaccines had harmful effects that were not being disclosed. In August 2024 that figure had fallen to 56%, and those who thought it was definitely or probably true had soared from 14% to 34%.

By June 2023, almost a quarter of UK adults told a separate study they believed Covid was a hoax. In 2021, the percentage of children in England who were fully vaccinated by their fifth birthday fell below the WHO target of 95% for the first time, NHS figures show; it now stands at 92.6% – though this too has been a longer-term trend, according to child health experts.

“I don't think this is necessarily a unique phenomenon,” says Karen Douglas, a professor of social psychology at the University of Kent, whose work focuses on the appeal and consequences of conspiracy theories. “We know that during any time of crisis whenever there is social unrest, people are worried and scared, and we tend to see conspiracy theories. It's a perfectly natural reaction.”

People felt unsafe and were being drip-fed information, obliged to comply with unprecedented state controls and isolated from their normal social networks – it was, she says, a “perfect storm” to foster conspiracy theories. “Most people aren't talking much about the Covid 19 crisis any more, but I think that at least for some people these doubts and feelings of mistrust that are associated with conspiracy theories have remained.”

Did anything positive emerge from the pandemic? Some evidence, during the crisis, certainly suggested so: three times as many people told an ICM survey in late 2020 that the disease had brought society together (41%) as said they felt it was more divided (13%).

Even then, though, the sense of unity was slipping. In May 2020, 60% of people said that overall, the public's response to Covid showed it was united; seven months later that number was down to 50%. Despite anecdotal and polling evidence during the lockdowns of new local connections being forged, more recent data suggests we may have reverted to where we started. In 2023-24, 61% said they felt strongly or very strongly connected to their local neighbourhood, according to government statistics; that is about the same as 2021-22 (63%), and every other year back to 2015 (60-63%).

“There definitely was a sense of coming together,” says Duffy. “There was a sense of: could this be a revival period for civil society? But it's not dissimilar to lots of the other infrastructures we put in around Covid [that have since been dismantled]. As soon as a crisis is gone, we do slip back to the usual way of working … I suspect it was always a bit of wishful thinking.”

More time will need to pass before the legacy of Covid can be accurately assessed. But, suggests Duffy, history may come to judge its impact – relative to pre-existing trends in society – as having been less consequential than it seemed at the time.

“Covid definitely will be seen as part of the [forces] defining now and into the future, but only a part,” he says. “Not to the extent that you would think a global pandemic that upended our life for two years would.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Children particularly vulnerable to unexploded war remnants scattered throughout country as more than a million people return

More than 200 people, including women and children, have been killed in Syria in incidents involving war remnants in the three months since the fall of the Assad regime, as bomb disposal experts warn that “no area in Syria is safe”.

The number of casualties has risen as approximately 1.2 million people return to their former homes and lands after being displaced by the country's brutal civil war.

Thousands of landmines and unexploded shells and munitions are scattered across the country in major cities and rural areas that witnessed military operations and bombings over 14 years.

As families return to their homes, accidental contact is killing hundreds. Children are particularly vulnerable to cluster munitions, sometimes mistaking them for toys. By last week, 640 people had been killed or injured, according to the world's largest land mine charity, the Halo Trust. An earlier UN report had found that a third of the victims were children.

“We cannot say that any area in Syria is safe from war remnants,” said Mohammed Sami Al Mohammed, mine action programme coordinator for the Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, an NGO funded by governments and development organisations.

Mohammed said it would take decades to remove the mines and make Syria safe. “There are countries where wars ended 40 years ago, yet they are still unable to completely eliminate this danger. The matter is not that simple and what happened in Syria is far more devastating than what occurred in other places.”

Volunteers have been helping to try to clear people's land to make it safe for them to return, but tragically have also been losing their own lives as a consequence.

Since the fall of the Assad regime in December last year, Fahd al-Ghajar, 35, had been regularly posting pictures on Facebook showcasing his dangerous work clearing mines in various locations across Syria.

In one of his posts, he expressed pride in removing mines from farmland used for grazing livestock, captioning it: “The most beautiful thing is the end.” In February, Ghajar wrote about the death of one of his colleagues, saying: “Syria is free, but we, the engineering team, lose someone every day. In the end, we are all dead; what matters is to clean the country.”

On 21 February, Ghajar was killed by a landmine explosion while demining a farm in northern Syria. He had successfully cleared the house, but a mine detonated while he was inspecting the field, killing him instantly, said his brother Abduljabbar Alghajar.

Ghajar, who was married with four children, had learned how to plant and remove mines while working for the Syrian army prior to the start of the civil war in 2011, after which he left and joined the opposition movement seeking to bring an end to the Assad regime.

“He sacrificed himself so that others could live,” said Alghajar, who remembered him often saying: “The country has been liberated, and we, the engineering specialists, must stand by these people and remove the mines to help them return to their homes.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Palestinian experts and British archaeologists say more than two-thirds of heritage, cultural and archaeological sites in Gaza have been damaged

Hamouda al-Dahda stands in the ruins of Pasha Palace in Gaza City, where before the war the golden limestone walls of the 800-year-old building towered above him, the gardens shaded visitors, and the cool vaulted halls held hundreds of priceless historical artefacts.

“The palace was like a small paradise on Earth. Now, there is no life here at all and anyone who comes is sad. They can remember what it once was,” the 40-year-old museum director says.

There is little left of the palace – a mansion and fortress during Mamluk and Ottoman rule over Gaza and where Napoleon Bonaparte once spent several nights. Israeli bombardment and fighting in Gaza City during late 2023 and early 2024 left just a few sections of wall and an arch standing. Almost nothing remains of the museum.

For Dahda, the loss is personal too. He had not wanted to leave the palace and so did not join hundreds of thousands of others fleeing to the south of Gaza when war broke out. In December 2023, he was staying with his wife and three daughters nearby when there was a huge explosion.

“All my close family members were pulled out from under the rubble injured, except for my daughter Mervat, 12 years old, who was pulled out as a lifeless body. May God have mercy on her,” he says.

Pasha Palace is one of dozens of major heritage sites destroyed or badly damaged in the war in Gaza, which was triggered by a Hamas surprise raid into southern Israel in October 2023 in which 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians, and 251 abducted. The death toll from the Israeli offensive that followed reached more than 48,000 people, also mostly civilians, before a fragile ceasefire came into effect in January 2025.

The offensive devastated Gaza, leaving fewer than a 10th of homes untouched, and destroying sanitation systems, health facilities, schools, universities, roads and much else.

Palestinian experts working with British archaeologists estimate that more than two-thirds of heritage, cultural and archaeological sites in Gaza have been damaged, often very badly.

Many appear to have been directly targeted by Israeli forces in attacks that could constitute war crimes in some circumstances. Israeli officials have said cultural monuments such as the Pasha Palace were only ever attacked if used by Hamas for military purposes and deny accusations that such sites were deliberately targeted for destruction.

Close to Pasha Palace is Hamam al-Samara, a 700-year-old bath house that was among the most important of Gaza's monuments. Its guardian was Salim al-Wazir, 74, who spent the war in southern Gaza living in tents.

Al-Wazir took over management of the bath house in 1970 from his father, whose own father had rented it from a famous family of Gaza notables during the era of Ottoman rule.

“On the first day we could return to the north of Gaza from where we had been sheltering, I didn't go to my home but instead came first to check on the hamam,” he says.

Wazir was stunned. The hamam had been almost entirely destroyed.

“I lost a place that meant a lot to me, a place that gathered people and provided them with comfort and relaxation. I also lost a part of my family's history and of course of Gaza's collective memory,” he says.

A recent report by Palestinian conservation experts in the occupied West Bank and UK-based archaeologists estimated that just protecting historical sites from further damage in Gaza – if the current ceasefire holds – will cost about $33m and take up to 18 months. Full reconstruction could cost almost 10 times more and take up to eight years.

Competing proposals for the reconstruction of Gaza have paid little attention to historical sites. Donald Trump proposed levelling the territory after displacing its inhabitants to build a “Riviera of the Middle East”. Others look to cities such as Dubai for inspiration, with a focus on towering hotels and malls, not heritage.

But many in Gaza City want a different future for even the most badly damaged historical buildings, calling for their protection and eventual reconstruction.

“If no one else takes on the task, I will spend the rest of my life rebuilding [the Hamam al-Samara] myself,” says Wazir. “I think we can reconstruct it exactly as it was, using the same stones and design. That way we can restore its former spirit.”

Experts also point to bombed Roman and Greek remains, as well as bulldozed historical cemeteries, to underline the cultural richness that is still potentially at risk of further damage – either from a return to war or clumsy reconstruction.

Many residents see the al-Omari mosque, the oldest and largest in the territory, as the greatest potential loss. The building was originally a Byzantine church, then was converted into a mosque after the Islamic conquest of Palestine almost 1,400 years ago. It was expanded over the centuries and rebuilt once after being almost destroyed by British artillery targeting an Ottoman ammunition dump there.

Historians point to the mosque, along with a Roman port and other sites, as evidence of the importance of Gaza as a thriving trading centre for 2,000 years.

Tarek Haniya, 60, had been working at the mosque as a tour guide since his youth.

“I have lived my life in Gaza, next to the mosque. The war was harsh in every sense of the word. Every day felt like a new nightmare. I lost my friends, I lost family members, I lost my home that had sheltered me for decades, and I lost the Omari mosque as I knew it too,” he says.

Though the mosque's famous Mamluk-era wooden pulpit has survived almost undamaged, much of its roof is gone, most walls are in ruins and the minaret partly toppled.

“It will definitely be restored. In fact, we are already working on that. There is a team collecting the broken stones of the mosque to restore it as soon as possible. True, the old mosque held irreplaceable history within its walls, but we will rebuild it.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Civil liberties report warns that Italy along with Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Slovakia intentionally undermining rule of law ‘in nearly all aspects'

Italy's government has profoundly undermined the rule of law with changes to the judiciary and showed “heavy intolerance to media criticism”, in an emblematic example of Europe's deepening “democratic recession”, a coalition of civil liberties groups has said.

A report by the Civil Liberties Union for Europe (Liberties) said Italy was one of five “dismantlers” – along with Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Slovakia – that “intentionally undermine the rule of law in nearly all aspects”.

In Hungary, long classified as an “electoral autocracy”, researchers detected “significant regression” in the rule of law in 2024. Pressure on non-governmental groups and media intensified after the launch of Hungary's sovereignty protection office, which has broad powers to investigate Hungarians active in public life.

“Europe's democratic recession has deepened in 2024,” Liberties said in a statement. The report, shared with the Guardian before publication, highlighted judicial systems subject to political manipulation, weak law enforcement against corruption, overuse of fast-track legislative procedures, harassment of journalists and growing restrictions on peaceful protests. “Without decisive action, the EU risks further democratic erosion,” the report – compiled by 43 human rights organisations in 21 EU member states – concluded.

Liberties began the annual exercise in 2019 to shadow the European Commission's rule of law reports, which are meant to serve as a democratic health check on EU member states. The NGO's six reports showed “the alarming persistence of rule of law violations throughout the European Union,” said Viktor Kazai, senior rule of law expert at Liberties. “All fundamental aspects of the rule of law have faced increasingly severe problems in the past few years,” he added, while the EU's attempts to reverse the decline had been “disappointingly limited”.

“The most worrying category of countries” were the “dismantlers”, Kazai said, governments that were taking steps to undermine the rule of law.

In Italy, researchers highlighted how Giorgia Meloni's government had drafted proposals to give “open-ended powers” to the justice ministry over prosecutors, which would increase political control over the judiciary. The Italian contributors also flagged “unprecedented levels of interference in public service media”, such as the cancellation of the author Antonio Scurati's “anti-fascist manifesto” and the disciplinary case opened against the host of the talkshow in which the speech was to have been performed.

In Bulgaria, the report looked at how anti-corruption investigations were launched against prominent political opponents of the government, while long-running schemes – such as the dumping of construction waste in the Sofia municipality – continued. In Slovakia, red flags have been raised about numerous changes introduced by the government of the nationalist populist Robert Fico, including the abolition of the office of the central prosecutor and a “Russia-style” foreign agents bill that would require NGOs to bear the stigmatising label of “foreign-supported organisation” if they receive more than €5,000 (£4,200) from outside the country.

In Croatia, the integrity of the justice system was seen as damaged, after the elevation to the position of state attorney general of Ivan Turudić, a judge with close links to the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party. The European public prosecutor's office has complained of “Croatia's systemic challenges in upholding the rule of law”, after Turudić's office appeared to challenge EPPO's right to investigate a suspected case of fraud against the EU budget.

In Romania, recent presidential elections revealed how TikTok could allow a little-known ultranationalist to surge to victory, while a bill to secure the independence of public service TV and radio has been languishing in parliament since 2021.

The report authors also warned that “role-model democracies”, including France and Germany, in north-western Europe were not immune to problems.

In France, researchers warned about the growing use of the article 49.3 procedure to push through decisions without a vote, as well as increasing restrictions on freedom of expression, introduced before the Olympics or to counter foreign interference.

In Germany, researchers praised stronger rules designed to combat “revolving doors”, where senior officials take up jobs in sectors they recently regulated. But they raised concerns about “excessive and disproportionate” responses to pro-Palestinian events, including censoring pro-Palestinian voices or denying entry to the country to the Greek former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, who had been invited to speak at such an event. Last April police shut down what would have been a three-day Palestinian conference in Berlin, fearing it would give a platform to antisemitic views.

Poland, which is attempting to roll back the assault on independent institutions, was described as a cautionary tale. The coalition government led by Donald Tusk has sought to restore judicial independence and media pluralism, but has run into conflict with the president, Andrzej Duda, who is aligned with the previous ruling party, as well as the complexities of unpicking compromised institutions. Poland “illustrates that addressing the compromised independence of institutions is an extremely challenging and fragile endeavour”, Liberties said.

The NGO is calling on the European Commission to toughen up the EU monitoring exercise by linking it to the release of EU funds, as well as accelerated legal action for violations of the rule of law.

Social media platforms face significant fines if they fail to implement robust measures in the UK to tackle illegal content, including fraud, terrorism, and child sexual abuse material, under new digital safety laws.

Tech companies must implement safeguards that take action against illegal harms such as encouraging suicide, extreme pornography and selling drugs.

From Monday, every site and app within the scope of the Online Safety Act, which covers more than 100,000 services from Facebook, Google and X to Reddit and OnlyFans, will be required to take steps to stop such content appearing or to take it down if it goes online.

The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said the illegal content crackdown was “just the beginning”. “In recent years, tech companies have treated safety as an afterthought. That changes today,” he said.

Companies that breach the act face fines of up to £18m or 10% of worldwide revenue, which in the case of those such as Facebook's owner, Meta, or Google would equate to billions of pounds. In extreme cases, services can also be taken down.

Ofcom, the UK watchdog overseeing the act, has published codes of conduct for tech platforms to follow in order to avoid breaching the legislation. The act lists 130 “priority offences”, or illegal content, that tech companies must tackle as a priority by ensuring their moderation systems are geared to deal with such material.

The codes of conduct include: hiding children's online profiles and locations by default from users they do not know; introducing measures that allow women to block and mute users who are harassing or stalking them; establishing a reporting channel for organisations that can help deal with online fraud cases; and using “hash matching” technology, which is used to identify illegal images, to prevent sharing of terrorist content and non-consensual intimate images, or “revenge porn”.

Last year Ofcom warned that tech companies had a “job of work” to do in order to comply with the act and had yet to introduce all the measures needed to protect children and adults from harmful content. Speaking to the Guardian in December, Jon Higham, Ofcom's online safety policy director, said many of the safety measures recommended by the watchdog were not being implemented by the largest and riskiest platforms.

“We don't think any of them are doing all of the measures,” he said.

Ofcom also announced on Monday that it would ask online storage and filesharing services to outline what measures they have in place to prevent paedophiles from distributing child sexual abuse material via their platforms. Any company that does not respond, or appears to have inadequate measures in place, faces an investigation.

Mark Jones, a partner at the law firm Payne Hicks Beach, said the new illegal harms measures marked a “considerable sea change” in dealing with illegal or harmful content because they required tech companies to be proactive in identifying and removing dangerous material.

The Online Safety Act has been the subject of criticism by the US vice-president, JD Vance, who said last month that free speech in the UK was “in retreat”. However, Kyle has insisted the act will not be a bargaining chip in any negotiations with the Trump administration over the threat of tariffs being imposed on British exports to the US.

“Our online safety standards are not up for negotiation. They are on statute and they will remain,” Kyle told LBC radio last week. The British government's view, which Keir Starmer reiterated in Washington last month, is that the act is about tackling criminality, not censoring debate.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Defence minister says Ukraine ‘systematically transforming' its military; Macron says allied security force does not need Russia's blessing. What we know on day 1,118

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has appointed Andriy Gnatov as chief of the general staff of the armed forces, replacing Anatoliy Bargylevych, who has been moved to chief inspector of the defence ministry. “He [Gnatov] is a combat guy,” Zelenskyy said. “His task is to bring more combat experience … Everything that our brigades have learned from the war should be implemented 100% at the planning level.” Ukraine's defence minister, Rustem Umerov, posted: “We are systematically transforming the armed forces of Ukraine to enhance their combat effectiveness. This involves restructuring the command system and implementing clear standards.”

Russia launched a drone attack on Kyiv, its mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said early on Monday, adding that Ukrainian air defence units were responding. Reuters said its witnesses heard blasts that sounded like air defences in action. On Sunday, Kyiv said Moscow had launched 90 Iranian Shahed drones on to nine Ukrainian regions.

Emmanuel Macron has said France, the UK, and other nations providing security guarantees for Ukraine after any eventual ceasefire would not be aiming to deploy a “mass” of soldiers but instead could send contingents of several thousand troops to key locations in Ukraine without needing Russia's permission. From Paris, Angelique Chrisafis writes that the French president insisted: “Under no circumstances can the Ukrainians make territorial concessions without having any security guarantees.” Macron said Russia “does not give the impression it sincerely wants peace”; on the contrary, the Russian president was “escalating the fighting” and “wants to get everything, then negotiate”.

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin are expected this week to discuss the ceasefire proposed by the US and Ukraine, write Edward Helmore and Shaun Walker. Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff said he thinks “the two presidents are going to have a really good and positive discussion this week”, and Trump “really expects there to be some sort of deal in the coming weeks, maybe, and I believe that's the case”. Moscow said the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had called his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. “Sergei Lavrov and Marco Rubio agreed to remain in contact,” the Russian foreign ministry said, with no mention of the proposed ceasefire. Witkoff claimed Putin accepted the “philosophy” of the ceasefire. However, Putin has been vague about what terms he would demand or accept.

Late on Sunday, Zelenskyy said he had spoken with Canada's new prime minister, Mark Carney. “The prime minister made the right points about how we need to step up pressure on Moscow,” Zelenskyy said. “The shadow fleet, the banking sector. We must impose all-out sanctions on everything that provides Russia with funding for its war. Only then can we force Putin to a just and lasting peace.” Carney is due in France on Monday for talks with Emmanuel Macron that will cover the war in Ukraine, before travelling to London to meet Keir Starmer, the British PM.

Lithuania on Sunday backed an EU proposal to pledge up to €40bn in military aid for Ukraine this year and said a similar amount would also be needed in future years. While some EU countries have responded cautiously to the initiative, Lithuania's foreign minister, Kestutis Budrys, said long-term military support for Ukraine should not depend on the outcome of any peace talks as it was already clear Kyiv would need to maintain strong “deterrence forces for Russians not to return”. Lithuania spent 2.85% of GDP on defence in 2024, according to Nato estimates, and has committed to raising that figure to 5% to 6% between 2026 and 2030.

Russia would demand that Nato members exclude Ukraine from membership and that it will remain neutral in any peace deal, Alexander Grushko, a Russian deputy foreign minister, has told the Russian media outlet Izvestia.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Huge demonstrations in Houthi-controlled areas come as more than 50 people die in strikes responding to Red Sea attacks

Tens of thousands of people protested in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen on Monday, two days after the US launched a wave of deadly airstrikes on the country that killed at least 53 people and injured almost 100 more.

Many demonstrators waved placards and assault rifles, chanting “death to America, death to Israel”, at a huge protest in the capital Sana'a, while rallies were also held in Saada, Dhamar, Hodeida and Amran.

US officials say the airstrikes, which Washington says were punishment for the Iran-backed Houthi rebels attacking Red Sea shipping, were also designed to signal a new assertive approach to Iran.

The US and Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen are both vowing escalation after the US launched a wave of deadly airstrikes on Saturday with the stated aim of deterring the rebel group from attacking Red Sea shipping. Officials said 53 people had been killed including “five children and two women”, and that 98 people had been injured.

The Red Sea port city of Hodeidah and the al Jawf governorate, north of the capital Sana'a, were said to have been targeted by fresh US airstrikes on Monday. In the early hours of Monday morning, the Houthi rebels said they had carried out two missile and drone attacks in 24 hours that included targeting the USS Harry S Truman, an American aircraft carrier, in the Red Sea. These claims have not been confirmed on the record by Washington.

US President Donald Trump warned on Monday afternoon that Iran will be held responsible and face “dire” consequences for any further attacks by Yemen's Houthis.

Tens of thousands of people protested in Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen on Monday following the deadly US attacks. Many demonstrators waved placards and assault rifles, chanting “death to America, death to Israel”, at a huge protest in the capital Sana'a, while rallies were also held in Saada, Dhamar, Hodeida and Amran.

Iran will respond to Trump's invitation to talks after proper scrutiny, the foreign ministry said on Monday, accusing Washington of not matching actions with words.

An Israeli air strike killed three Palestinian men – all from the same family – in Gaza on Monday as they tried to gather firewood, medics said. Later on Monday, medics said an Israeli air strike killed a father and his son inside a school sheltering displaced families in central Gaza's Bureij refugee camp, near the site of the earlier airstrikes, raising the day's death toll to at least five. There have been many more reports of Palestinians being killed by Israeli forces since the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the US, came into effect on 19 January.

Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles continue to be positioned around the occupied West Bank city of Jenin and its refugee camp, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. Wafa correspondents are reporting that Israeli bulldozers are levelling streets and widening others to allow for the entry of more military vehicles.

Benjamin Netanyahu has announced he will seek to dismiss the director of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, through a cabinet vote later this week, in a move that will prompt further accusations of authoritarianism. The Israeli prime minister said in a video statement on Sunday that “ongoing distrust” made it impossible for him to continue to work with Ronen Bar, who has led Shin Bet since 2021.

Donald Trump has said Iran will be held responsible and face “dire” consequences for any further attacks by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels.

The US president said in a post on Truth Social:

Let nobody be fooled! The hundreds of attacks being made by Houthi, the sinister mobsters and thugs based in Yemen, who are hated by the Yemeni people, all emanate from, and are created by, IRAN. Any further attack or retaliation by the “Houthis” will be met with great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there. Iran has played “the innocent victim” of rogue terrorists from which they've lost control, but they haven't lost control. They're dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, “Intelligence.” Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!

His comments come as US officials say airstrikes launched against Houthis will continue indefinitely, after a first round on Saturday killed at least 53 people and injured almost 100 more. Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said on Sunday that his group would target US ships in the Red Sea as long as the US continues its attacks on Yemen.

In response to the deadly American airstrikes, the Houthis have subsequently claimed responsibility for two attacks on the US aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman and several American warships in the Red Sea, though these reports have not been confirmed by the US.

The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric, has said that a failure to help Syria “get back on its feet” will result in a fresh wave of outward migration.

More than 300,000 refugees have returned to Syria hoping to start over following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad, according to the UN.

“When you don't have schools for your children, when you don't have functioning hospitals, when you don't have access to water and energy, when your house is still collapsed and you don't have the means to rebuild it, you will be forced to leave,” Spoljaric told the Agence France-Presse news agency (AFP) in an interview.

“Syria is at the crossroads,” Spoljaric said, adding that peace and stability were “possible” but required “a lot of attention” from the international community.

She was in Brussels for an annual donor conference, which for the first time saw Syrian authorities represented - with interim foreign minister Assaad al-Shibani in attendance.

Syria's new leaders are trying to consolidate control over territory that was divided into de facto ministates during nearly 14 years of civil war and to rebuild the country's economy and infrastructure. The UN has previously estimated that it would cost at least $250bn to rebuild Syria, while experts say that number could reach at least $400bn.

The EU has vowed around €2.5bn ($2.7bn; £2.1bn) in aid for Syria as the bloc seeks to help the country's recovery after the toppling of Bashar al-Assad late last year

“Syrians need greater support, whether they are still abroad, or they decide to go home. And this is why today, the European Union is increasing its pledge for Syrians in the country and in the region to almost 2.5 billion euros for 2025 and 2026,” European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen told a donor conference in Brussels.

The UK's foreign office, meanwhile, said it would pledge up to £160m ($200m; €190m) in humanitarian aid this year to support Syria's recovery. The foreign office said the funds would “help provide Syrians with critical water, food, healthcare and education in 2025”.

The Houthis' Al Masirah TV – which was founded and is owned by the rebel group - is reporting that the US carried out new airstrikes on Yemen on Monday. The Red Sea port city of Hodeidah and the al Jawf governorate, north of the capital Sana'a, were said to have been targeted. We have not yet independently verified these reports but the US Central Command (Centcom) posted a video on X this morning appearing to show a fighter jet taking off from an aircraft carrier. In the post, it said American forces had continued operations “against Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists”.

The US launched a wave of deadly airstrikes on Saturday with the stated aim of deterring the rebel group from attacking Red Sea shipping. The airstrikes hit Sana'a and other provinces, including Saada, the Houthi rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia, killing at least 53 people, including several children, according to officials.

Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said on Sunday that his fighters would target US ships in the Red Sea as long as the US continues its attacks on Yemen. “If they continue their aggression, we will continue the escalation,” he said in a televised speech.

In the early hours of Monday morning, the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels said they had carried out two missile and drone attacks in 24 hours that included targeting the USS Harry S Truman, an American aircraft carrier, in the Red Sea. There was no immediate comment on the record from the US about the attacks claimed by the Houthis.

The Qatari foreign ministry has issued a statement following a meeting between the country's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who is also the foreign minister, and the UN's reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, Sigrid Kaag.

The statement read:

During the meeting, they discussed the close relations between the state of Qatar and the United Nations and ways to support and strengthen them. They also discussed the latest developments in the Gaza Strip, particularly the challenges facing humanitarian action, and ways for the two sides to cooperate to deliver humanitarian aid sustainably and without hindrance to all areas of the Strip.

HE the prime minister and minister of foreign affairs stressed, during the meeting, the need for the international community to shoulder its responsibilities to address the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza and to firmly confront the starvation policy pursued by the Israeli occupation in its brutal war against the brotherly Palestinian people.

More than 200 people, including women and children, have been killed in Syria in incidents involving war remnants in the three months since the fall of the Assad regime, as bomb disposal experts warn that “no area in Syria is safe”.

The number of casualties has risen as approximately 1.2 million people return to their former homes and lands after being displaced by the country's brutal civil war.

Thousands of landmines and unexploded shells and munitions are scattered across the country in major cities and rural areas that witnessed military operations and bombings over 14 years.

As families return to their homes, accidental contact is killing hundreds. Children are particularly vulnerable to cluster munitions, sometimes mistaking them for toys. By last week, 640 people had been killed or injured, according to the world's largest land mine charity, the Halo Trust. An earlier UN report had found that a third of the victims were children.

“We cannot say that any area in Syria is safe from war remnants,” said Mohammed Sami Al Mohammed, mine action programme coordinator for the Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, an NGO funded by governments and development organisations.

Germany is pledging a further €300m ($326m; £252m) in aid for Syrians through the UN and select organisations, the country's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said this morning ahead of an EU-led donor conference in Brussels. More than half of the funds, which will go towards providing food, healthcare and emergency shelters, among other relief, will be allocated without the transitional government in the country, she said.

There have been many more reports of Palestinians being killed by Israeli forces since the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the US, came into effect on 19 January.

On Saturday, Israeli airstrikes in north Gaza's Beit Lahia killed nine people, including four Palestinian journalists, the territory's civil defence agency said, in the deadliest attack on a single site since 19 January. The Israeli military claimed it had hit “a terrorist cell”.

The first phase of the ceasefire agreement ended two weeks ago but Israel is refusing to implement the scheduled second phase, which envisaged an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and a definitive end to the war.

Hamas condemned Saturday's attack as “a blatant violation of the ceasefire”. Gaza's Government Media Office has reported hundreds of violations by Israel, including military incursions, deadly airstrikes on Palestinian territory and aid obstruction.

Israel wants to extend the ceasefire's first phase, a proposal backed by US envoy Steve Witkoff. Hamas says it will resume freeing hostages only under the second phase that was due to begin on 2 March.

Hamas spokesperson Abdel-Latif Al-Qanoua said earlier today:

Hamas has complied fully with the agreement, while the occupation (Israel) didn't comply with some clauses. It (Israel) seeks to foil the agreement and impose new conditions.

The comments come as an Israeli delegation is reportedly in Cairo to talk about key details of the ceasefire with senior Egyptian officials. There is no immediate sign of progress at the renewed ceasefire talks.

Hamas said on Friday it had agreed to release American-Israeli soldier Edan Alexander and four bodies of the hostages if Israel agreed to begin talks immediately on implementing the second phase of the agreement. Israel accused Hamas of waging “psychological warfare” on the families of hostages.

Germany is pledging a further €300m ($326m; £252m) in aid for Syrians through the UN and select organisations, the country's foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said this morning ahead of an EU-led donor conference in Brussels.

More than half of the funds, which will go towards providing food, healthcare and emergency shelters, among other relief, will be allocated without the transitional government in the country, she said.

Syrian refugees and host communities in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey will also receive the support, Baerbock added.

Much of Syria lie in ruins and the economy has been ravaged by years of international isolation and crippling sanctions imposed after former president Bashar-al Assad's 2011 crackdown on the opposition sparked a brutal civil war.

The country faces a dire humanitarian situation, with an estimated 16.7 million people in need of assistance.

Syria's new rulers - headed by former Islamist rebel commander Ahmed al-Sharaa whose Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group spearheaded the toppling of Assad's repressive government late last year - have been clamouring for assistance to aid the country's recovery. The HTS group has its origins in al-Qaida and Islamic State, and was formally founded in 2017 after breaking with both.

The EU has eased sanctions on key sectors of the Syrian economy but insists the new authorities make good on promises for an inclusive transition.

Sharaa has promised an inclusive government - that respects minority rights – that will run Syria until the new constitution is finalised and elections are held. But there is still heavy skepticism about Sharra's commitment to these declarations. Many analysts view him is an extremist who has adopted a more moderate posture to try to achieve his goals.

The transitional process was threatened earlier this month after a wave of violence broke out on Syria's Mediterranean coast, in which security forces killed nearly 1,500 civilians, according to a war monitor, most of them members of the Alawite minority to which the Assad family belongs. Sharaa subsequently vowed to prosecute those behind the bloodshed, and the authorities have announced several arrests.

Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles continue to be positioned around the occupied West Bank city of Jenin and its refugee camp, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa.

Wafa correspondents are reporting that Israeli bulldozers are levelling streets and widening others to allow for the entry of more military vehicles.

Israel's military, police and intelligence services started a deadly raid in Jenin on 21 January, claiming it was targeting terrorists. We are now on the 56th day of the assault which has seen at least 34 Palestinian people reportedly killed by Israeli forces who have left a trail of heavy destruction in the area.

The city's mayor, Mohammad Jarrar, said the number of displaced people from the camp, made up of descendants of Palestinians dispossessed of their land when the state of Israel was created in 1948, has risen to 21,000, or around one-quarter of the population.

Jenin municipality director Mamdouh Assaf has been quoted by Wafa as saying Israeli forces have “razed” 100% of the Jenin camp and 85% of the city's streets, with entire neighborhoods in the camp reportedly being forcibly displaced by the Israeli military.

Jenin's refugee camp, among 19 refugee camps in the occupied West Bank, has long been a centre of armed Palestinian resistance to the Israeli occupation.

Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said earlier today that Iran will respond to Trump's letter “after full scrutiny”.

The Guardian's diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, has been reporting on the significance of Trump sending the letter to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who as Iran's supreme leader is the highest authority in the country, and what it signals about the fraught relationship between Washington and Tehran. Here is an extract from his piece:

The letter, the first step Trump has taken towards Iran since he announced the US was seeking to reimpose maximum economic pressure on Iran, comes at a time when the Iranian government is locked in a public dispute on the wisdom of negotiating with the US, and what pre-conditions should be set.

In recent days hardliners opposed to reaching out to the US appeared to have gained a decisive upper hand with MPs impeaching the economy minister, Abdolnaser Hemmati, and the resignation of Javad Zarif, the vice-president for strategy and a long-term advocate of reviving contacts with the west.

The ministry of foreign affairs also issued a strategy paper stressing that Iran was not prepared to lose its political independence.

The paper said: “Governments that set their policies in the hope of security guarantees from great powers in the end at critical junctures were left alone. Iran has learned this historical lesson well. Independence is not just a slogan, but an inevitable necessity.”

The loss of such key ministers reflected both the hardliner parliament's refusal to reconcile itself to the loss of the presidential election last year, and genuine public anger about the rapidly deteriorating state of the economy largely caused by the accumulation of years of economic sanctions.

Iranian politicians for months have been contradicting one another about the wisdom of talks, whether there could be direct discussions with the US and whether the talks should simply focus narrowly on reimposing a UN regime to oversee the safety of Iran's civil nuclear program.

As we mentioned in the opening post, Donald Trump last week sent a letter to to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in an attempt to jump-start talks over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.

While the text of the letter hasn't been published, it was sent as Trump levied new sanctions on Iran as part of his so-called “maximum pressure” campaign targeting the country.

The day after sending the letter on 5 March, Trump said: “I've written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you're going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing.'”

The US president has suggested that Tehran's nuclear capabilities – which now reportedly include enough near-bomb-grade fuel to produce about six weapons - were reaching a critical point.

Iran has offered a series of seemingly contradictory responses to Trump's letter. Khamenei said he wasn't interested in talks with a “bullying government” but the country's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi earlier suggested that talks over guarantees that Tehran wouldn't seek a nuclear weapon could be possible.

Amid these growing tensions, it has been confirmed that Iran's deputy foreign minister, Kazem Gharibabadi, will meet UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi at the agency's headquarters in Vienna later today.

Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei said the meeting with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was “part of our ongoing engagement with the agency”.

“As threats against Iran's peaceful nuclear facilities have increased, it is natural for us to intensify consultations with the IAEA,” Baqaei said.

In 2015, Iran signed an agreement with the five permanent members of the UN security council - Britain, China, France, Russia and the US - plus Germany to limit its nuclear activities in exchange for sanction relief.

Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the deal in 2018 and US officials now estimate that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within weeks if it so chose. Tehran has consistently denied pursuing nuclear weapons.

Benjamin Netanyahu has announced he will seek to dismiss the director of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service, through a cabinet vote later this week, in a move that will prompt further accusations of authoritarianism.

The Israeli prime minister said in a video statement on Sunday that “ongoing distrust” made it impossible for him to continue to work with Ronen Bar, who has led Shin Bet since 2021.

Netanyahu said: “We are in the midst of a war for our very survival … At any time, but especially during such an existential war, the prime minister must have complete confidence in the director of the [Shin Bet]. Unfortunately, however, the situation is the opposite.”

It comes after an increasingly acrimonious dispute between the men over responsibility for the failures that allowed the surprise Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 that sparked the war in Gaza.

Shin Bet is responsible for monitoring Palestinian militant groups. It recently issued a report accepting responsibility for its failures around the attack but also criticised Netanyahu, saying government policies were among its causes.

Netanyahu has not accepted any responsibility for the attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 251 being abducted, though he was prime minister at the time and has been in power for a total of 17 years.

Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in the Middle East.

The US and Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen are both vowing escalation after the US launched a wave of deadly airstrikes on Saturday with the stated aim of deterring the rebel group from attacking Red Sea shipping.

Updating an earlier death toll, Houthi health ministry spokesperson Anis al-Asbahi said 53 people had been killed including “five children and two women”, and that 98 people had been injured.

The airstrikes hit in the capital of Sanaa and other provinces, including Saada, the Houthi rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia.

Houthi rebels claimed on Monday to have twice attacked an American aircraft carrier group within 24 hours, calling it retaliation for the deadly US airstrikes.

The Houthis initially said they launched 18 missiles and a drone at the “aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman and its accompanying warships” in the Red Sea, before hours later claiming to have fired a second round.

The Houthi rebels say they will continue to target US ships in the Red Sea as long as the US continued its attacks on Yemen.

On Saturday, US President Donald Trump vowed to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks on Red Sea shipping, and warned that Tehran would be held “fully accountable” for their actions.

The Houthis, an armed movement who have taken control of most of Yemen over the past decade, say they have targeted international shipping in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza.

The attacks stopped when a fragile Israel-Hamas ceasefire took hold in January - a day before Trump took office - but last week the Houthis said they would renew attacks against Israeli vessels after Israel cut off the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza this month. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.

In other key developments:

The UN humanitarian aid organisation for children, Unicef, has warned that 1 million children in Gaza “are struggling to survive without basic necessities” amid the ongoing Israeli blockade on all aid. At the beginning of the month, Israel cut off humanitarian supplies to Gaza, claiming it was part of an effort to pressure Hamas into accepting a change in the ceasefire agreement to allow for the release of hostages without an Israeli troop withdrawal. “Hundreds of thousands lack clean water and sanitation. Water is a basic human right that no one should be denied,” Unicef said in a post on X on Monday.

Iran will respond to a letter by Donald Trump “after full scrutiny,” foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday. Last week, an Emirati official brought a letter from the US president proposing nuclear talks with Tehran, which Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected, saying such a proposal was “deception” from Washington.

Late on Sunday, Syria's defence ministry accused Hezbollah of crossing into Syrian territory and kidnapping and killing three members of Syria's new army formed after the toppling of the Assad regime late last year. Hezbollah denied any involvement. A Lebanese security source told Reuters the three Syrian soldiers had crossed into Lebanese territory first and were killed by armed members of a tribe in northeastern Lebanon who feared their town was under attack. In retaliation for their deaths, Syrian troops shelled Lebanese border towns overnight, according to the Syrian defence ministry and the Lebanese army. Lebanon's army said on Monday that it had handed over the bodies of the three killed Syrians to Syrian authorities, and that it had responded to fire from Syrian territory and sent reinforcements to the border area.

The Israeli army has killed at least four people in southern Lebanon in the past day, according to reports, despite a ceasefire agreed with Hezbollah that was meant to end the war.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Canadian PM stresses importance of ‘reliable allies' in joint press conference with French president

Canada is the “most European of the non-European countries”, Mark Carney has said during his first overseas trip as prime minister to France and the UK, where he is seeking stronger alliances to deal with Donald Trump's attacks on his country's sovereignty and economy.

Without mentioning the US president by name, Carney and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, held a joint press conference in Paris to show a united stance against what they said were economic and geopolitical crises – a reference to Trump's trade war and “America first” diplomacy that has left longtime allies scrambling.

“Canada is a unique friend,” Macron said, adding that fair trade was more effective than tariffs. Carney spoke in French and English, and said it was important for Canada to strengthen ties with “reliable allies”.

“I want to ensure that France and the whole of Europe work enthusiastically with Canada, the most European of non-European countries, determined like you to maintain the most positive possible relations with the United States,” he said.

A senior Canadian government official who briefed reporters on Carney's plane said the purpose of the trip was to strengthen partnerships with Canada's two founding countries. The official said Canada was a “good friend of the United States but we all know what is going on”.

Carney, a former central banker who turned 60 on Sunday, travelled to London later on Monday to meet King Charles, Canada's head of state. He was due to talk after with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, in an effort to diversify trade and coordinate a response to Trump's tariffs.

The trip to London is something of a homecoming, as Carney is a former governor of the Bank of England, the first non-citizen to be named to the role in its more than 300 years.

The former economist is deliberately making his first foreign trip to the capital cities of the two countries that shaped Canada's early existence. At his swearing-in ceremony on Friday, he noted the country was built on the bedrock of three peoples: Indigenous, French and British.

He said Canada was fundamentally different from the US and would “never, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the United States”.

Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, said: “The Trump factor is the reason for the trip. The Trump factor towers over everything else Carney must deal with.”

On his return trip home from Europe, Carney will travel to the edge of Canada's Arctic to “reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty” before returning to Ottawa, where he is expected to call an election within days.

Carney has said he is ready to meet Trump if he shows respect for Canadian sovereignty. He said he did not plan to visit Washington at the moment but hoped to have a phone call with the president soon.

Sweeping tariffs of 25% and Trump's talk of making Canada the 51st US state have infuriated Canadians, and many are avoiding buying American goods. Carney's government is reviewing the purchase of US-made F-35 fighter jets in light of Trump's trade war.

The governing Liberal party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war and said repeatedly that Canada should become the 51st state. Now the party and its new leader, Carney, could come out on top.

Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said Carney was wise not to visit Trump. “There's no point in going to Washington,” Bothwell said. “As [the former prime minister Justin] Trudeau's treatment shows, all that results in is a crude attempt by Trump to humiliate his guests.”

Bothwell said Trump demanded respect, “but it's often a one-way street, asking others to set aside their self-respect to bend to his will”.

Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said it was absolutely essential Canada diversified amid the trade war with the US. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the US.

Béland said Arctic sovereignty was also a key issue for Canada. He said: “President Trump's aggressive talk about both Canada and Greenland and the apparent rapprochement between Russia, a strong Arctic power, and the United States under Trump have increased anxieties about our control over this remote yet highly strategic region.”

Radio National, Triple J, ABC Classic and ABC News Radio were all down due to a technical issue from about 8am AEDT on Monday, broadcaster says

The ABC's national radio services were hit by a major unexpected outage for more than 90 minutes on Monday morning, with Radio National's flagship RN Breakfast affected on both analogue and streaming services.

Radio National was restored at about 9.30am AEDT, but ABC technicians were still working on other services mid-morning on Monday after an apparent technical glitch hit at about 8am.

The ABC said the outage also affected national services ABC Classic, ABC News Radio and Triple J, but most local radio stations remained broadcasting and online.

At 9.30am, Triple J and ABC in the Upper Hunter had not yet been restored.

“The ABC is aware of an issue which began after 8am AEDT this morning and is impacting some ABC audio services,” an ABC spokesperson said.

“The ABC has identified the issue and services are beginning to be restored. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.”

By Monday evening, the ABC said it had restored most audio services that suffered outages, although work was still underway on any continuing disruption as well as the underlying causes.

“We became aware of outages impacting broadcast and digital apps about 8am AEDT. This is understood to have resulted from updates to the core router which provides audio from the studios to the transmitters and digital services.”""

Sources said the switching control systems in radio master control in Sydney malfunctioned and resulted in the system going offline.

Programs and radio networks coming out of other state capitals, such as Melbourne, were not affected.

Hedge fund manager deliberately tried to frustrate investigation into sexual misconduct allegations, says regulator

The hedge fund manager Crispin Odey will be banned from the City and hit with a £1.8m fine by the UK's financial watchdog for deliberately attempting to “frustrate” a disciplinary process into sexual harassment allegations.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Monday that Odey had shown “reckless disregard” for the governance of his hedge fund and his conduct proved he was “not a fit and proper person to perform any function related to regulated activities”.

The 66-year-old Conservative and Brexit donor intends to challenge the decision, which relates to his behaviour between December 2021 and November 2022, in the upper tribunal.

The FCA provisional ruling comes more than four years after executives at his now-defunct hedge fund business, Odey Asset Management (OAM), first launched an internal investigation into harassment allegations at the firm in September 2020. Odey has denied any misconduct.

By 2021, the business had uncovered “numerous allegations of sexual harassment by Mr Odey of female members of staff between 2003 and 2020”, the FCA decision notice said. The investigation also found staff were reluctant to raise concerns about Odey's behaviour because they did not want to “ruffle feathers”, or were concerned that “nothing would be done”.

The FCA said Odey later tried to obstruct OAM's leadership from taking any action. That involved firing its entire executive committee – twice – in moves that the FCA said were “deliberately designed to frustrate OAM's disciplinary process into his conduct in order to protect his own interests”.

The allegations, which emerged in the media in summer 2023, eventually led to him being removed from OAM, which announced plans to close in October that year. OAM, which Odey founded in 1991, is now in the process of winding down and has been transferring funds to other asset managers.

The FCA, which launched its own investigation in September 2021, said the alleged misconduct had broader implications for customers and the wider financial industry.

“A culture of silence in which allegations of misconduct are not dealt with effectively can put consumers and markets at risk,” Therese Chambers, the joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said. “Mr Odey repeatedly sought to evade and obstruct efforts to hold him to account. His lack of integrity means he deserves to be banned from the industry.”

The FCA notified Odey that it planned to take action against him in November. It said it believed he had breached the regulator's code of conduct, which “required him to act with integrity”, between December 2021 and November 2022.

During that time, it said Odey had used his majority shareholding in OAM to get rid of the existing members of its executive committee, weeks before he was due to appear for a disciplinary hearing over sexual harassment allegations in January 2022.

It came after the board said it was making contingency plans to replace him in case he was dismissed, as new harassment allegations against Odey emerged.

Then, as the sole member of the executive committee, Odey decided to indefinitely postpone the misconduct hearing, saying he was unable to conduct it with impartiality, the FCA said.

Odey appointed a new executive board in January 2022, but fired them by March, as they tried to institute safeguarding measures meant to protect female staff. That included having Odey work remotely, or be separated from staff within OAM's offices.

The hedge fund manager resisted, allegedly calling one board member “spineless”, and saying that HR law “did not matter here”, before again installing himself as its sole member, the FCA decision notice said.

He is also alleged to have put pressure on the FCA to postpone OAM's internal disciplinary process pending the outcome of its own investigation. When the FCA did not agree, he told an FCA official in February 2022: “You will not get away with this. I have an agreement then you little guys, trying to do your work in the shadows. You are about to create a crisis … I will walk and leave you to clean up the mess,” according to the FCA decision notice.

Three more members were added to the board before the company finally conducted a disciplinary hearing in November 2022, nearly a year later than originally planned.

The FCA said Odey had shown “reckless disregard” for the hedge fund's governance, “causing OAM to breach certain regulatory requirements”.

Odey launched a £79m libel lawsuit against the Financial Times in December, saying he suffered “very significant financial loss” because of the articles alleging he had sexually assaulted or harassed multiple women.

He was also seen entering a courtroom last week to speak to lawyers working for the former Barclays chief executive Jes Staley, who is trying to overturn his own ban from the City over claims he lied about the depth of his relationship with the US paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Odey has been approached for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Chancellor will meet regulators after calling for action to restrict their scope in bid to save businesses billions

Rachel Reeves will meet UK regulators on Monday after calling for more action to restrict red tape and spur economic growth.

The chancellor argued that government plans would reduce costly delays and disputes, saving businesses billions, and said regulators must accept a more streamlined decision-making process.

Reeves is expected to use the meeting to announce more detail on how the government will cut the cost of regulation by a quarter and set out plans to slim down or abolish regulators themselves.

High on the chancellor's target list are the costly hold-ups to major infrastructure projects when environmental concerns are raised.

Citing the long battle over a covering for HS2 through ancient woodland, dubbed the bat tunnel, Reeves said wrangling between environmental regulators, councils and government departments needed to stop or time and cost overruns would persist.

One proposal will be to make it easier for private sector contractors to obtain environmental permits, with just one agency in charge of the system, and permits being scrapped for low-risk or temporary projects.

The meeting follows the announcement last week that NHS England – dubbed the world's largest quango – would be scrapped as part of an effort to overhaul the health service.

Reeves said: “Today we are taking further action to free businesses from the shackles of regulation.

“By cutting red tape and creating a more effective system, we will boost investment, create jobs and put more money into working people's pockets.”

The chancellor will meet representatives from eight regulators, including the Financial Conduct Authority, Prudential Regulation Authority, the Environment Agency, Natural England, the medicines regulator and the Information Commissioners' Office.

Last week Keir Starmer said the Payments Systems Regulator would be folded into the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to simplify the regulatory system. Reeves is expected to commit to scrapping more regulators over the course of the parliament.

On Monday, officials said she will announce the abolition of a third quango – the Regulator for Community Interest Companies – which will be folded into Companies House.

It is understood ministers will be instructed to report back to the chancellor by the summer with further suggestions for quangos that could be culled.

Since taking office, Reeves has made clear government agencies must support her efforts to expand investment and grow the economy. She is expected to use Monday's meeting to unveil 60 measures that regulators have agreed to undertake to boost economic growth.

These include fast-tracking new medicines, reviewing the £100 limit on contactless payments, simplifying mortgage rules and holding two major drone-flying trials to pave the way for drone delivery services.

At the end of last year, the prime minister said regulators must come up with “concrete proposals” to boost growth as the government attempts to turn around Britain's struggling economy.

Although the UK avoided a recession in the second half of 2024, the economy has shown few signs of recovery with business and consumer confidence remaining low and firms shedding workers. Figures released last week showed a 0.1% fall in GDP in January.

Rain Newton-Smith, chief executive of the Confederation of British Industry, said the UK's “Gordian knot of regulations” hindered investment with compliance costs that were too high “leaving us trailing the international competition”.

She said: “Today's announcement signals a shift towards a more proportionate, outcomes-based approach that should deliver more sustainable growth and investment.”

But the Conservative shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said Reeves “and her job-destroying, tax-hiking budget” were “the biggest barrier to growth” in the UK.

He added: “For as long as businesses remain under the strain of Labour's taxes and trade union red tape, they will be unable to focus on the priority of growth.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Vacancies increase in building sector after low levels of activity in recent months amid economic uncertainty

Vacancies have increased in the construction industry as well as for gardeners, teachers and maintenance workers, according to a new report.

Research by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and data firm Lightcast showed a recent fall in demand for veterinary nurses, delivery drivers and train and tram drivers.

The number of jobs advertised last month was more than 1.5m a slight increase on January, although newly posted job opportunities in February were 10% lower.

The REC chief executive, Neil Carberry, said: “Firms have been working hard to find growth in the face of rising costs since the budget, and it is reassuring that some are now feeling more ready to hire.”

Construction firms have reported low levels of activity in recent months in response to uncertainty about the outlook for housing and commercial building projects.

However, plans by the government to boost housing starts, lower interest rates and rising property prices have meant firms are now hoping to increase capacity and hire more workers.

Carberry said: “The same applies to the substantial rise in adverts for parts of the underpressure hospitality sector.”

The treasurer will say ‘we deserve better as a long-term partner and ally' in major economic address on Tuesday one week before delivering budget

Jim Chalmers will warn Australia must focus on resilience over retaliation as the Trump administration overturns the rules that have governed the global economic order for the past four decades.

Chalmers will deliver a major economic address in Brisbane at lunchtime on Tuesday, a week ahead of a budget where the Albanese government will spruik its bona fides as a responsible fiscal manager while unveiling the first of what is expected to be a string of deficits into the 2030s.

The treasurer is not expected to reveal any major new spending promises in his fourth budget, as Labor holds fire ahead of the official start of the campaign for an election that must be held by mid-May.

Slamming the US president Donald Trump's tariffs as “self-defeating and self-sabotaging”, Chalmers in his speech will point to fresh OECD warnings that the world economy will grow more slowly as a result of American trade aggression.

“In a world of retaliation and escalation, the impacts of tariffs are amplified. They linger for longer, resulting in a bigger reduction in GDP and a bigger increase in prices,” Chalmers will say.

“Our response to this will not be a race to the bottom on tariffs, because more and higher tariffs would harm, not help, our workers, businesses, industries and economy.”

The Paris-based OECD – a 38-member grouping of rich countries, including Australia – on Monday evening issued a more downbeat assessment of the global economy, laying the blame on Trump's tariffs.

The OECD's economists slashed their estimates for Australian real GDP growth from 2.5% in 2026 to 1.8% and well below the Reserve Bank's forecast of 2.3%.

The same report warned the rise in protectionism would push consumer prices higher and could force central banks to start lifting interest rates to contain any inflationary resurgence – although the inflation outlook for Australia remained largely unchanged and even lower in 2026 as slower growth bites.

Despite recent improvements in growth, wages and inflation – alongside last month's interest rate cut – the opposition believes its most effective attack on the Albanese government is asking Australians whether they are better off now than they were before the last election, while also painting Labor as fiscally reckless.

The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, on Monday repeated his charge that “this is the biggest-spending, biggest-taxing government in Australian history” and warned of even higher taxes under Labor.

As the major parties draw their rhetorical battlelines for the upcoming budget – one that was forced upon the government after ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred swept away plans to call an April election – Chalmers says the intense storms and flooding in Queensland and northern New South Wales will deliver a $1.2bn hit to the economy.

The treasurer in his speech on Tuesday will frame the budget against a backdrop of escalating trade tensions and ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.

“It's clear the rules that underpinned global economic engagement for more than 40 years are being rewritten,” Chalmers will say.

“The whole world has changed. We've seen that change accelerate since [Trump's] inauguration day. Developments since then have not been surprising but they have been seismic. As a trading nation, Australia has a lot at stake.

“The decision not to exempt Australia from American tariffs on steel and aluminium was disappointing, unnecessary, senseless and wrong, as the PM rightly pointed out. We are not uniquely disadvantaged by these tariffs, but we deserve better as a long-term partner and ally.”

After delivering two straight surpluses, Chalmers has cautioned that Australians should expect the budget to drop back into the red. When questioned on Monday, the treasurer would only say the deficit “will be much, much smaller than what we inherited from our political opponents”.

The budget deficit in 2021-22 was $32bn, before Labor delivered surpluses of $22.1bn and $9.3bn in the next two financial years. December's mid-year fiscal update estimated a deficit of $26.9bn for 2024-25, although economists anticipate it will be smaller.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

‘We have more cards we can play,' foreign secretary tells MPs as he says G7 foreign ministers found ‘common ground' when meeting last week

David Lammy, the foreign secretary, told MPs that G7 foreign ministers were able to find “common ground” when they met in Canada last week, despite claims in advance that this would not be possible.

He said a ceasefire offer was now on the table, “Ukraine is serious about peace”, and it was now up to President Putin to decide how to respond. He said:

Now it is Putin who stands in the spotlight, Putin who must answer, Putin who must choose. Are you serious, Mr Putin, about peace? Will you stop the fighting? Or will you drag your feet and play games, pay lip service to a ceasefire while still pummeling your prey?

My warning to Mr. Putin is this – if you are serious, prove it with a full and unconditional ceasefire now.

But Lammy said Putin did not seem interested in a ceasefire, and so the G7 was considering further action.

If Putin does not deliver, and I must tell the house that I currently see no sign yet that he is, the G7 meeting helped us ready the tools to get Russia to negotiate seriously. We're not waiting for the Kremlin. If they reject a ceasefire, we have more cards that we can play.

We can all see the impact the G7's unprecedented sanctions have had on Russia's faltering economy; social spending down, inflation and interest rates sky high. There can be no let up in our efforts.

In Canada we discussed where we can go further to target their energy and defence sectors, further squeeze their oil revenues and use frozen Russian assets. At the same time we will keep up our support to Ukraine – Europeans clearly need to shoulder our share of this responsibility.

The former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean has warned the chancellor against making kneejerk cuts in next week's spring statement to try to hit fiscal targets that are five years away.

Welfare ministers have suggested that people worried about the disability benefit cuts being announced tomorrow may be reassured when they see the details – while refusing to guarantee that people who are too sick or disabled to work aren't at risk of losing money. (See 3.07pm, 3.37pm and 4.54pm.)

David Lammy, the foreign secretary, has told MPs that Britain and its G7 allies have have “more cards that we can play” to help force Russia to negotiate “seriously” about a ceasefire in Ukraine. (See 4.38pm.)

Downing Street has said that more than 30 countries could be involved in the “coalition of the willing” plan to provide military support to Ukraine in the event of a peace deal. (See 1.19pm.)

She was soon ejected from the Central London hall by members of the audience.

A second woman appeared to shout about the cost-of-living crisis as she was ejected from the room.

At the event, which marked 50 years since Margaret Thatcher helped to set up the think tank, Badenoch could be heard to say: “I hardly think Mrs Thatcher can be blamed for the cost-of-living crisis.”

Nigel Farage has presented 29 councillors who have joined Reform UK as he tries to move his party on from a damaging rift surrounding the suspension of one of its MPs, Rupert Lowe.

Regulators will face twice-yearly performance reviews from ministers, aimed at forcing them to be more growth-friendly, as the chancellor warned that “too much bureaucracy” is holding back the economy.

Britain's media regulator is scrambling to close a legal loophole that allowed politicians on GB News and other broadcasters to in effect act as newsreaders.

Yesterday Wes Streeting, the health secretary, claimed there has been some “overdiagnosis” of mental health conditions.

According to polling by YouGov, almost four out of 10 people (37%) seem agree with Streeting that getting a diagnosis is too easy. But 32% say getting a diagnosis is too hard, and 14% say the balance is about right – meaning at last 46% don't agree with Streeting.

(Streeting talked about there being “overdiagnosis” of mental health conditions, whereas YouGov asked about it being “too easy” to get a diagnosis; the terms have different connotations, although roughly they imply the same thing.)

The polling also found considerable differences between demographic groups on this issue.

Women are more likely to say getting a diagnosis is too hard, not too easy – while men are more likely to say the opposite.

The under-50s are more likely to say getting a diagnosis is too hard, not too easy – while the over-50s are more likely to say the opposite.

People from London and Scotland are more likely to say getting a diagnosis is too hard, not too easy – while people from the rest of Britain are more likely to say the opposite.

And Labour and Lib Dem supporters are more likely to say getting a diagnosis is too hard, not too easy – while Conservative and Reform UK supporters are more likely to say the opposite.

King Charles has welcomed Mark Carney, the new prime minister of Canada, to Buckingham Palace. Later Carney is meeting Keir Starmer in No 10.

The king does not routinely meet foreign prime ministers when they visit London, and Carney is not staying in London for long. But the king is Canada's head of state and, with President Trump repeatedly saying he wants the US to annex Canada, Charles seems to be more than usually keen to show Canadians that they have his full support.

The Green party MP Siân Berry has welcomed the growing interest in a wealth tax (a Green party policy) as an alternative to disability benefit cuts. (See 9.31am.) She said:

We are pleased to see pressure for a wealth tax growing, something the Green party has long argued for. Just a 2% tax on people with assets above £10m would raise far more than the savings proposed through welfare cuts. This tax is long overdue. The government cannot delay any longer. Now is the time to tax extreme wealth and stop punishing the poorest and most vulnerable.



During work and pensions questions in the Commons earlier Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary, asked Liz Kendall for an assurance that she had “collective agreement” for the plans for disability benefits being announced tomorrow.

When Kendall urged Whately to be patient, and did not directly address the question about cabinet support, Whately claimed this reply meant Kendall did not have the support of cabinet colleagues.

In another exchange Siân Berry, the Green MP, asked for an assurance that the benefit cuts being proposed would not be implemented this calender year, or without a vote by MPs.

Stephen Timms, the social security and disability minister, replied:

I recognise there has been a good deal of anxiety and I regret that that has occurred. But there won't be long to wait, the proposals will soon become clear and I think she will welcome a great deal of the changes we want to make.

David Lammy, the foreign secretary, told MPs that G7 foreign ministers were able to find “common ground” when they met in Canada last week, despite claims in advance that this would not be possible.

The urgent question is over, but Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, is now raising a point of order.

Jenrick claims that Nicholas Dakin, the justice minister, misled MPs when he said the new Sentencing Council guidelines were approved by the last government. He says that the guidelines on which the last government was consulted were not the same as the ones finally published, because new wording was added, as the council itself admitted in its recent letter.

The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, objects, and tells Jenrick to accuse Dakin of inadvertently misleading the house. MPs are not allowed to accuse each other of being deliberately misleading, or lying.

Dakin says he doesn't think he inadvertenly misled MPs.

Desmond Swayne (Con) said the Sentencing Council row showed why it was a mistake for MPs “to delegate powers to quangos which then clearly come up with solutions which we find repulsive”.

Dakin says, if Swayne had been present at the meeting last week, he would not have seen it as Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, just “asking” for a new approach.

He says there was a constructive exchange of views and that a “proper process” is now in place, “which I am confident will come up with the right answer”.

Josh Babarinde, the Lib Dem justice spokerperson, said two-tier justice already existed in the UK. He said the country used to be run by “two-tier Tories who thought they could get away with illegal number 10 parties, while the rest of us told to stay at home”. And he described Jenrick as a two-tier Tory “who unlawfully approved a development for his donor”.

Andy Slaughter, the Labour chair of the Commons justice committee, spoke out in defence of the Sentencing Council. He said the new guidelines did not require pre-sentence reports to be obtained for offenders in the designated categories, including minority ethnic people, and did not prevent judges getting pre-sentence report for other people.

Dakin said Slaughter was making a good point.

Responding to Jenrick, Nicholas Dakin, the justice minister, said Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, met the Sentencing Council to discuss this dispute last week.

He says they had a “constructive discussion” and Mahmood agreed to set out her objections in more detail in writing. The council agreed to consider those before the guidelines came into effect.

Dakin said this process should be allowed to play out.

Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, is now asking a Commons urgent question about the new Sentencing Council guidelines that he claims will create “two-tier justice”.

He says the guidelines, which say judges should normally ask for pre-sentence reports when certain categories of offender, including minority ethnic offenders, are being sentenced. This violates the prinicple of equality before the law, he says.

He says the people who draw up the guidelines should be sacked.

He says the government should back his bill allowing the government to intervene. And he says he thinks Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, is refusing to do this because she secretly agrees with the plans.

The Conservative MP Lincoln Jopp asked what the government was doing about “so-called ‘sickfluencer' sites, social media platforms where people are shown how to game the benefits system”.

In response, Alison McGovern, the employment minister, said:

We have a fraud bill going through the House at the moment and the issue that he has raised is at the forefront of the attention of my fellow minister, the minister for transformation [Andrew Western], and he will take every step he can to deal with issues in that area.

Later, in response to another question on the same topic, Western said the government inherited “an appalling level of fraud in the welfare system” from the last government. He said the fraud bill included a £8.6bn package to tackle fraud.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Thinktank says unauthorised absence is ‘a leading cause' of performance gap between disadvantaged pupils and peers

Unauthorised school absence is a leading cause of the widening performance gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers in England, according to analysis from a respected thinktank.

The research by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) found that all of the increase in the “disadvantage gap” among 16-year-olds since 2019 can be explained by students on free school meals (FSM) missing more time off school than other pupils, putting them several months behind in terms of their results.

“It is unauthorised absence that is of key concern, particularly at secondary school. Compared with authorised absence, it contributes more to the GCSE gap, and its contribution has grown faster since 2019,” the report stated.

Poor attendance has also widened the attainment gap at all ages. The EPI calculated that if disadvantaged pupils had the same attendance record as other pupils, the attainment gap at age 11 would be almost 10% smaller, and the gap at age 16 would be 20% lower.

Emily Hunt, the EPI's associate director of social mobility, said: “For the first time, we have shown that high and increasing levels of absence among disadvantaged pupils are the primary reason why the disadvantage gap has grown since 2019 and that the government won't tackle the gap unless it gets to grips with the complex root causes of absence.”

School leaders endorsed the EPI's analysis. Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “Too often, the burden of ensuring children attend school falls entirely on teachers and leaders, who are then held accountable for absences beyond their control.

“Without a broader system of support, it is extremely difficult for schools to drive meaningful change in attendance rates.”

Di'Iasio said that “for some families, school seems to have become – at least in part – optional”, and said fines for taking unauthorised termtime holidays were failing to halt that trend.

“Far from solving the problem, fines often deepen tensions between schools and parents. Schools, simply enforcing the rules, are left looking like the villains,” Di'Iasio told the ASCL's annual conference on Saturday.

The Department for Education's data showed one in 50 pupils at state schools in England missed at least half of their lessons in 2022-23, with pupils on free school meals twice as likely to be absent than others. The DfE will this week publish its updated school attendance figures for 2023-24.

Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, told the ASCL conference that “green shoots are appearing, especially in our secondary schools” on attendance.

Phillipson added: “If we keep this up, we'll achieve one of the biggest annual increases in recent memory.”

The EPI found that children whose special educational needs and disabilities (Send) were not identified early in their time at school were likely to fall behind. Hunt said the results were “confirmation that the youngest children with Send have been some of the worst impacted, post-pandemic.”

The research also found that girls “are increasingly making less progress during secondary school than boys since the pandemic. We therefore reiterate our call for more research to understand the declining attainment of girls and any links with the widening of the gender mental health gap in recent years.”

Attainment gaps continued to grow among all age groups, according to the EPI. By age seven, nearly 60% of the gap at age 11 had already developed.

The thinktank is calling on the government to tackle the disadvantage gap by increasing the early years pupil premium – paid to education providers for disadvantaged children aged from nine months – to match the pupil premium in later years.

A DfE spokesperson said: “This government inherited a system with a number of baked-in inequalities, and this report is further evidence that the absence epidemic is having a detrimental impact on children's learning and their future success. Getting more pupils attending school regularly is a top priority for the government.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

At each stop on 1,000-mile trip, discombobulated Europeans are grappling with new and unsettling realities as the US reforges its alliances

While Donald Trump talks of the “big beautiful ocean” separating the US from the war in Ukraine, 1,000 miles of rail track links London St Pancras to the city of Lviv in western Ukraine.

The 19-hour trip takes in Brussels, the German economic powerhouse of Frankfurt, and Vienna, the Austrian capital, before the train rattles into Kraków in south-east Poland and Przemyśl, the Polish border town where the slimmer railway gauges of western Europe meet the wider tracks of Ukraine and Russia to the east.

At each stop, Europeans are grappling in different ways with new and unsettling realities after the US president appeared in recent weeks to herald the end of Pax Americana.

In London, rightly or wrongly, and perhaps out of sheer necessity, the idea of the special relationship remains a comfort blanket. There is a new steely resolve in Brussels but the temptation persists to push decisions back.

A leading German politician described the incoming government in Berlin as “democracy's last bullet” but some worry they will shoot themselves in the foot. Austrians cling to their traditional neutrality as if that alone will keep them safe. In Poland, there is, perhaps, the greatest clarity as to what they think must be done. Yet its polarised political class, traditionally Atlanticist in outlook and discombobulated by the turn in Washington, argues about how to find the money to do it as public opinion wavers over the presence of 1 million Ukrainian refugees. As the Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci was quoted as saying in 1929: “The old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born; now is the time of monsters.”

There was a sense of quiet satisfaction in the Ministry of Defence's main building on Whitehall when, during one of his unpredictable press huddles in the Oval Office last week, Donald Trump said he was pleased that Nato was “stepping up”. It is a phrase that the British defence secretary, John Healey, had been pushing as part of Britain's effort to keep Washington engaged. Now it was being echoed in the White House.

The first person Healey called after the announcement that the UK would increase its spending on defence to 2.5% of GDP by April 2027 was his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth. In the six weeks the American has been in office, Healey has spoken to him four times, twice in person. Meanwhile, at 6pm every Tuesday evening, Britain's defence secretary rings his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov. “It's very clear that a precondition for the US taking European security seriously is Europe showing we are taking our own security seriously,” a Whitehall source said.

Few would dispute that Keir Starmer and Healey have been pulling all the diplomatic levers at their disposal. Richard Shirreff, formerly a British general and previously Nato's European deputy supreme allied commander, believes “the prime minister is still trying to be a bridge between Trump and Nato” and if the US is up for that “then fantastic”.

“But from a purely security perspective, I think we have to accept that Europe and Canada have got to stand on their own without America,” he says. “We've got to get real. America has not just drifted away. It's cut itself off. Anybody who thinks that America is still committed to Nato is … I don't know what they're smoking.

“You have to assume that the American security guarantee for Europe has gone. We are in a new world. The French have been absolutely right about strategic autonomy, and the British line that America ‘will always be the leader of Nato' has been proved completely wrong.”

He adds: “The only way that we are going to avoid catastrophe in Europe is through effective deterrence and to deter effectively means you have to be ready for the worst case.

“The worst case is war with Russia, and this means that we have to look to not just increasing the size and capability of our armed forces, we have to build societal resilience.

“We have to look at home defence. We have to look at civil defence, and we have to look to the mobilisation of industries, building up a war economy – the whole nine yards.”

The timetable for the Eurostar services from London St Pancras to Brussels once defined the parameters of the working day for Georg Riekeles, as an EU official dealing with British Brexit negotiators.

Riekeles, a Norwegian, has worked in the Brussels institutions for about 15 years, most recently as a diplomatic adviser to Michel Barnier. Today, nursing a small Vedett beer in Le Coin du Diable bar in the shadow of the European Commission's towering headquarters, he is taking a break from his work for the European Policy Centre thinktank. “It's no overstatement to say that European countries are facing the most dire situation they have faced since the end of the second world war,” he says.

Some of the barricades that fortified the EU quarter during a summit of leaders are yet to be removed but the circus has moved on. EU leaders agreed to “become more sovereign [and] more responsible for its own defence”. They endorsed a decision to open up €150bn (£125bn) in loans for European defence spending, and to relax the rules on spending and debt rules to allow Europe to potentially raise a further €650bn over the next four years for arms.

After years of France vainly banging the drum for strategic autonomy from the US, European leaders' hands have been forced by Trump's suspension of military aid and intelligence support to Ukraine, now reinstated, the start of bilateral peace talks with Vladimir Putin and the imminent attack on European businesses through import tariffs.

The summit should be seen as the first of a series of European “war councils”, Riekeles says. He predicts that financial and military support for Ukraine will ratchet up as forms of hard security arrangements less dependent on the US are being worked out. But “this is not a system where you can just push a button”.

It is in the “European DNA” to “want to think that the world is globalising, that a more open world and interdependence is a condition for security, rather than dependencies or interdependencies being at risk of creating a security risk”, says Riekeles.

The reality is that it will take a little time to respond to the “new world”, he says. “Think of Germany, I mean, they decided to rely on Russia for their energy, for China for trade and the US for security,” says Riekeles. “All three of them are gone.”

As the high-speed train from Brussels Midi to Frankfurt enters Aachen station, on the Belgian-German border, two officers in the black uniform of the polizei spot something and start to run along the platform. They board the train and zero in on a black man halfway down coach 23. “Where is your ID card?” they demand of the man in English, after he fails to understand their German. He duly offers his passport. His papers are in order. They move on. “Always the same,” says Dr Oliver Gnad, who runs the Bureau of Current Affairs thinktank in Frankfurt. “It feels super uncomfortable. It starts to become a racist system.”

In 2022, the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights found that more people of sub-Saharan African heritage were stopped by police in Germany (33%) than in any other European country apart from Austria (40%) in the previous five-year period.

Immigrants and asylum seekers have become a target for politicians seeking to assuage the anger of those at the rough end of Germany's ailing economy  and failing infrastructure, as epitomised by a much-maligned rail network.

After the most recent election, Germany's chancellor in waiting, Friedrich Merz, the leader of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union, announced a plan to make constitutional amendments to unleash up to €1tn in defence and infrastructure spending. “Germany is back,” he said.

Merz has a small window to push the plan through before the new Bundestag is convened on 25 March with its blocking group of the far-right, pro-Kremlin Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and the Left party.

Prof Matthias Moosdorf, a cellist by profession with a hairstyle worthy of the pop star Leo Sayer in his pomp, is the AfD's foreign policy spokesperson in the Bundestag.

The MP says he joined the party after being ostracised for his belief that Germany had a problem of “other cultures not related to our culture”. “My colleagues from the music world said, ‘OK, you are now engaged with this Nazi party, and we don't allow you to give any concert any more',” he says.

Moosdorf believes Vladimir Putin does not pose a threat to Germany and that the rush to change the constitution to increase spending was “anti-democratic”.

“We are a dysfunctional country,” he says. “We have all the migration problems. We have all the problems with deindustrialisation. It doesn't make any sense for the biggest country like Russia to risk a war against Nato, against Germany. This is completely nonsense.”

The AfD became Germany's second largest party after winning 20.8% of the vote in the election, and is by far the dominant force in east Germany.

“If they [the government] don't deliver on my cost of living, if they don't deliver on ‘I feel threatened by mass immigration and we don't integrate them', then I think the AfD is going to rise to probably the biggest party in the next elections,” says Gnad, who was forced to work from home today because of a transport strike.

One of his friends is Ben Hodges, who was the commanding general of the United States army Europe until his retirement in 2018. He lives in Frankfurt with his German-American wife.

“This is anything but a peace plan, it is a surrender,” says Hodges, 66, of Trump's recent intervention.

“I think it's pathetic that Europe has taken so long to get its act together and combine its economies to challenge Russia,” he adds. “You could shut down Russia economically, if you were serious about it. But I'm afraid there's too many countries in Europe are still benefiting from Russian crime.”

The distinctive gondolas of the Wiener Riesenrad, the grand ferris wheel in Vienna's Prater park, appear unchanged since they featured in the film noir classic The Third Man. The film's director, Carol Reed, and author, Graham Greene, explored the moral ambiguity of postwar Vienna and the immanent good and evil of mankind.

There is no shortage of ambiguity in Austria's approach to Ukraine. Agreement on a new centrist coalition government was reached a few weeks ago, and while Austria has been a neutral state since the second world war, it has affirmed its support for Ukrainian sovereignty. Yet Austria was within a whisker of having its first far-right-led government since 1945, and one that is openly pro-Kremlin. The Freedom party (FPÖ) won the largest share of the vote in the recent election with 28.85% of votes cast. Coalition talks fell by the wayside over the party's demands for control over the interior ministry, among other issues.

Austria would have probably joined Hungary and Slovakia as potential blocks on EU efforts to support Ukraine. The FPÖ's leader, and the country's prospective chancellor, Herbert Kickl, has spoken of the “long history of provocations, including by the US and Nato”.

It offers a worrying portent of what could happen in Germany, suggests Marcus How, the head analyst at VE Insight, an investment risk adviser. “Politically, it's always been a bit of a kind of canary in the coalmine,” he says.

Sipping on a glass of apple juice in Cafe Landtmann, a favourite of Sigmund Freud, Thomas Hofer, a former journalist who reported on the FPÖ and now runs a political consultancy, says there is a tendency, exhibited in varying degrees by a lot of Europeans, for Austrians to believe they can float above world events. “Don't you feel all right? Isn't it nice? Isn't it comfortable?” he says.

It has been a tense few weeks at the Polonia wax museum (“So bad, it's good” was a recent review) a short walk from Kraków's central station. They were not sure whether to save their money for a new pope, when the sculptures cost up to €12,000 each. Following reassuring news about the health of the pope from the Vatican, the owner, Marian Dreszer, opted to update his models of Trump, Volodymr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader has been on display in the basement in a jail cell due to incidences of him being spat upon and punched by visitors. The three men will be put around a negotiating table, says Dreszer. “But maybe Trump will be spat at too now,” says his son Maciej.

It has been a particularly distressing time for Poles of a certain age as the Trump administration reveals its seeming indifference to European security, says Dr Natasza Styczyńska, an associate professor at Kraków's Jagiellonian University.

“It's a huge disappointment especially for the traditionally pro-Atlantic generation, people who still remember communism, for whom America was always the embodiment of democracy, freedom, minority rights, you know, all of these things we didn't have,” she says. “For this generation this is a shock.”

There is, however, near unanimity that part of the response must be to ramp up defence spending.

Poland will spend an expected 4.7% of GDP on defence this year, the highest among the Europeans in Nato. The prime minister, Donald Tusk, has spoken of the potential for Poland to acquire a nuclear deterrent. He has further proposed more than doubling Poland's army to 500,000 troops and establishing compulsory military training for all adult men by the end of the year.

But all this has a cost. And in Kraków's city hall, Aleksander Miszalski, a mayor with ambitions to revitalise the transport system and open new parks, says money is tight. A debate is raging about how to find cash at all levels of government. “Inflation and rising cost of salaries and energy are big problems,” he says.

Next month Miszalski, 44, who is a political ally of Tusk's and regional chair of his Civic Platform party, will travel to Warsaw for a meeting about civil defence – and building bunkers. “We've got like 5% of what we need,” he says. “We have a lot of them but very small. In hotels, old bunkers, small bunkers. We need to hide 1 million people in case of something … You have to change what you have been thinking about for the last decades.”

The grand, white-stone railway station at Przemyśl, close to the Polish-Ukrainian border, has been a first port of call for hundreds of thousands of refugees from the war in Ukraine. What was a deluge is now a trickle but the numbers being taken in at the Hope Foundation refugee centre, a place for short-term stays, tend to swell when Russian strikes are at their heaviest.

They are looking after just 15 people at the moment – and that is just as well. Their funders' promise of a new furnace was killed off by Trump's decision to end USAid support in Ukraine. The online psychological support provided by a Greek NGO was also terminated as a result of the White House decision. “The impact was immediate,” says a local volunteer, Jacek Wiarski. “It's unpredictable because of the blond-hair guy.”

Maryna Drasbaieva, 21, who has been in the centre for nearly a year after escaping Kherson, the partially occupied region of south Ukraine, was a trainee baker at home and delights the other residents with her pancakes. She shakes her head, and looks away when asked whether Trump could bring peace. “I hate politics,” she says. “There was too much dying at home. My mum needs an operation. We want to go to Germany.”

It has not been easy to keep the centre going, with some local resentment bubbling up in the last two years at the 1 million Ukrainian refugees in the country. A recent posting on social media asking for donations received a depressing response, says Wiarski. “They write, ‘Why do you want to support them?'” he says. “‘Why are they getting our money from the social security?'”

It is the start of spring in western Europe but as the train passes through Medyka, the border crossing between Poland and Ukraine, the sky is sleet-grey and there is heavy snow.

In the train's second carriage, Anastasia Krapyva is returning to Kyiv to see her family. She left Ukraine in 2023 for Germany, where she works in a laundry, and admits to having mixed feelings about coming home. It scares her a bit.

“It's no good,” she says. “What Donald Trump is doing is not good for Ukraine. It might be good for Russia but not Ukraine.”

During a visit to the Unbroken national rehabilitation centre in Lviv, Serhiy Kiral, the city's deputy mayor, who also has a responsibility for international cooperation and visited Washington in that capacity shortly before the presidential inauguration, is no less despairing of the American approach.

He quotes Henry Kissinger: “To be an enemy of America can be dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal.”

“What will the Americans decide?” asks Kiral. “Are they going to side with Putin again? I think at some point, if that continues, we'll probably have to say ‘enough is enough. You know, you're either with Ukraine or you are with Russia.”

He believes Europe can fill the gaps left by the US. “What is the alternative?” he asks.

Illia Dmytryshyn, 26, is a paratrooper who took a bullet to his thigh in Bakhmut, in eastern Ukraine, and watched as a friend trying to rescue him was blown in half by a drone.

“We've already lost so much,” he says. “If the Europeans do step in and start helping more, that would definitely help. But even if they don't, we are still going to keep fighting and defending our land to the last metre.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Syria's army attacked Lebanon after it said three soldiers were kidnapped, brought to Lebanon and killed by Hezbollah militants. Hezbollah denied involvement.

BEIRUT — The Syrian army fired rockets and artillery into northern Lebanon overnight after it said three of its soldiers were kidnapped, brought to Lebanon and killed by Hezbollah militants, in a violent escalation of simmering cross-border tensions.

Residents fled as Lebanese border towns came under attack and Syrian troops exchanged fire with local armed groups and Lebanese soldiers. Tensions across the two countries' porous border have been brewing since Syria's new Islamist leaders ousted Bashar al-Assad, a key ally of Hezbollah and Tehran, in December.

The spasm of violence had largely died down by dawn Monday but put on display how thinly spread Lebanon's army is at a time when it is also being tasked with enforcing the conditions of a ceasefire with Israel by ensuring that Hezbollah no longer operates in southern Lebanon.

It also came as Syria's new government, under rebel turned president Ahmed al-Sharaa, attempts to show that it can exert control over areas of Syrian territory traditionally supportive of the former regime and unify the country, following a wave of deadly sectarian violence along Syria's coast this month.

The Lebanon-Syria border has long operated as a key smuggling route for Hezbollah, and Syria's new government has promised to crack down on Iran using its soil as part of a network for smuggling arms and cash to its proxy forces.

Syrian state media said the three soldiers were ambushed near the Zeita Dam, west of Homs, and were killed on the spot after being taken to Lebanese territory. Hezbollah denied the accusations, saying in a statement it “has no connection to any events taking place within Syrian territory.”

The details surrounding the deaths of the soldiers could not be independently verified and remain unclear. Lebanese media reported that three armed men entered Lebanon first, resulting in clashes with local tribespeople who believed they were under attack. Many of the tribes in northeastern Lebanon are loyal to Hezbollah.

Syrian state media, citing an unnamed Defense Ministry official, said the Syrian army shelled “Hezbollah gatherings that killed the Syrian soldiers” along the border as they retaliated against the deaths. It was not immediately clear whether there were additional casualties on either side.

Al Arabiya, a Saudi-owned regional news outlet, said its cameraman and several other journalists sustained minor injuries reporting on the clashes. The outlet said their injuries were caused by a Hezbollah rocket falling near them.

The Lebanese army sent reinforcements to the northern border with Syria on Sunday evening and said that it responded to the source of fire and opened communication lines with Damascus to ease the tension. In the presence of the Lebanese army, the bodies of the soldiers were returned to Syrian territory, it said in a statement.

As Lebanese troops responded to Syrian fire in the north, Israel attacked Lebanon's southern border Sunday and Monday, Lebanese state media reported.

Israel's energy minister said Sunday that he would immediately cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip, in an apparent effort to pressure Hamas on negotiations after the first phase of a ceasefire deal expired on March 1. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The protest in Belgrade, Serbia, was the culmination of four months of rallies against President Aleksandar Vucic's government after a deadly train station roof collapse.

Tens of thousands of protesters filled the streets of Serbia's capital over the weekend, the culmination of more than four months of demonstrations against the government of President Aleksandar Vucic and what they see as its slow response to a deadly train station collapse in November. The protest movement is a major challenge to Vucic, who has dominated the political sphere for about a dozen years. Here's what to know.

Anti-government protests initially began in response to the train station collapse, with protesters displaying a red-stained hand as a symbol of their belief in the government's culpability.

But they have since evolved into a “nationwide wave against government malpractice, systemic corruption, and weak institutional oversight,” said Strahinja Subotic, who took part in Saturday's protests and works as a senior researcher at the European Policy Center think tank.

Protesters have blamed the deadly collapse on what they said were shady ties between local politicians and contractors that resulted in a shoddy renovation of the station. In the aftermath, Transport Minister Goran Vesic resigned, and the public prosecutor's office later indicted him and 12 other people on public-safety-related charges and irregular execution of construction work. But the protests continued, as critics pushed for investigators to add corruption charges.

In January, Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned alongside his government, saying he did not want to “further raise tensions in society.” But Vucevic's resignation “has not resolved the underlying crisis,” Subotic said in an email, and public frustration with Vucic has grown.

Saturday's rally undoubtedly represented “the largest protest in Serbian history and the most significant challenge to the ruling regime” in 12 years, Subotic said.

Although the protest movement has been informally led by students, it has grown to include other sectors of society, and “a lot of people are supporting them,” said Engjellushe Morina, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank.

While most of the protests that have taken place in the past four months have been peaceful, there were some clashes between protesters and pro-government agitators. In January, during a memorial in Belgrade for the victims of the Novi Sad disaster, a man rammed his car into a student. The public prosecutor's office said it would charge the man, whom it identified only by the initials M.P., with aggravated attempted murder, according to the publication Balkan Insight. A similar incident took place in November in the town of Pozarevac, the publication reported. Dozens of individuals have also been arrested during protests.

Morina said the government's response to these incidents — particularly comments made by Vucic that seemingly downplayed the crash in Pozarevac — has further angered the protesters. “This annoys people because … they can sense that he's not serious about these changes,” she said.

Student organizers of the protests have issued several demands: They want the government to publish all the documents relating to its investigation into the renovation of the Novi Sad train station, which was led by Chinese constructors, and prosecute anyone involved. They have also demanded the arrest of anyone involved in attacking protesters and that any protesters who were arrested be pardoned. And they asked for an increase to the state's education budget.

The government has acted on many of these demands. Vucic in January pardoned 13 protesters, and the public prosecutor's office said it had opened criminal proceedings against 41 people for attacks against protesters. The prosecutor's office also published documents relating to the Novi Sad investigation. And in February the government adopted a proposal to amend the nation's higher education law to provide teachers with higher salaries, reduce some students' tuition and give universities more funding and independence from government.

But Morina said the government's concessions have not put an end to the protests because “people have lost trust that [Vucic] can deliver.”

“What Vucic is doing right now is being seen as patching things up, not seriously addressing the concerns,” she said.

“At the heart of the situation lies a deep atmosphere of distrust, particularly as the ruling regime continues to attempt to [delegitimize] both the protesters and their demands,” Subotic said.

Even as the Vucic government has met some of the protesters' demands, it has suggested without providing evidence that the protest movement is funded by foreign powers to destabilize Serbia.

Earlier this month, Donald Trump Jr. visited Serbia and interviewed Vucic, who called the protest movement an “imported revolution.”

Vucic last month cited Trump's criticism of USAID — which his administration has mostly dismantled and accused of political bias and wasteful spending — in justifying raids on at least four nonprofits in Serbia that he claimed received funds from USAID and were involved in the protests. The move prompted alarm from civil society groups, which said it was an attempt by the government to silence and scare critics.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The photo is said to have been taken Sunday, when Francis was co-celebrating Mass in the chapel of the hospital suite where he has been battling a health crisis.

ROME — In the photo, Pope Francis appears slightly slumped in his wheelchair, adorned in white robes and a purple stole before an altar at the Rome hospital where he has been a patient since Feb. 14. The shot is not head on — perhaps because it remains frowned upon in the Holy See to capture clear images of an ailing pope.

The photo shared by the Vatican on Sunday — the first of Francis since his hospitalization — is said to have been taken earlier in the day, when, officials said, Francis was co-celebrating Mass in the chapel of his hospital suite where he has been battling the worst health crisis of his papacy. There is no one else present in the photo and there are no signs of tubes or an oxygen mask. The pope is positioned on the opposite side of where a priest might stand to say Mass. The identity of the photographer who took the image was not disclosed.

It was a consolation prize of sorts.

Anticipation had run high Sunday that Francis might make his first public appearance since his admission to Rome's Gemelli hospital a month ago. A group of refugee and underprivileged children had turned out earlier in the day to say prayers and read aloud letters to the pope. From an interior courtyard, near a statue of Pope John Paul II, they sent up chants in Italian of “torna da noi!” — “return to us!” Eyes were peeled on the windows above, but the pope never showed.

Francis is said to be recovering. The latest health update from the Vatican on Sunday night called his condition “stable,” noting that he continued sessions of respiratory and motor therapy. He had no visitors and spent the day praying, resting and doing a “little work.”

In a written version of his Angelus prayer — typically read aloud by the pope on Sundays, though he has not done so since his hospital admission — Francis acknowledged the extent of his health troubles. “I am sharing these thoughts with you while I am facing a period of trial and I join with so many brothers and sisters who are sick: fragile, at this time, like me. Our bodies are weak but, even like this, nothing can prevent us from loving, praying, giving ourselves, being for each other, in faith, shining signs of hope.”

He added, “I thank you all for your prayers, and I thank those who assist me with such dedication. I know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to Gemelli as a sign of closeness. Thank you, dearest children! The Pope loves you and is always waiting to meet you.”

Despite intense pressure from the media, the Vatican had refrained from distributing or allowing photographs of the ailing pope. Instead, it has issued surprisingly detailed reports on his health and described several meetings between the pope and senior clerics, as well as one early in his stay with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

The absence of images has made Francis the target of rampant fake photos and false claims across social media, with some posts even claiming that Francis might  be dead. It remained unclear the extent to which the image released Sunday would quell that furor.

Francis on March 6 issued a short recorded message from his hospital suite to the faithful who have been praying for his health nightly in St. Peter's Square. In the 26-second message, the pope's words were halting, as if he was gasping for breath.

The 88-year-old pontiff, who had part of one lung removed in his youth, has for weeks been on nightly treatments of “noninvasive mechanical ventilation” — an exterior mask that covers the mouth and nose and is one step short of a breathing tube. In a medical update Saturday, the Vatican said his condition was improving to the point where doctors have gradually begun reducing ventilation, though Francis remains on high-flow oxygen as he undergoes respiratory and physical therapy.

Doctors last Monday removed what had been a “guarded prognosis” on Francis's health, saying his respiratory infection no longer posed a direct threat to his life. However, they have warned that his age and frailty have left his overall medical condition “complicated.” No target date has been announced for his hospital release.

During his health crisis, the Vatican has sought to portray a pope who, even from his hospital bed, has remained at work, taking several significant steps and furthering a slow-moving process of church reform.

On Saturday, the Vatican announced that Francis, on March 11, had given approval to a timeline for furthering the recommendations of two historic church summits, or synods, in 2023 and 2024. The synods resulted in calls for greater participation of the laity in decision-making, as well as increased transparency and accountability by church leadership. Ten study groups were also created, including one charged with evaluating the role of women in the church, including their possible ordination as deacons — a step that Francis has been reluctant to take even as he has permitted dialogue on the topic.

The new timeline authorized by Francis calls for publication in May of new guidelines that dioceses across the globe will be asked to embrace. The schedule calls for a three-year “implementation” process ahead of a new major “ecclesial assembly” in Vatican City in 2028.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

            Lebanon says it was struck by shelling from Syria, after three Syrians were killed in Lebanon, escalating tensions between Beirut and Syria's new Islamist-led government.
    


            Lebanese villages on the border with Syria were subjected to shelling after three Syrians died in the northern Lebanese town of Qasr, the Lebanese military said on Monday, adding that its forces responded to the attack.
    


            “Contacts continue between the army command and the Syrian authorities to maintain security and stability in the border area,” it said. The Syrian shelling also targeted Qasr, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said.
    


            On Sunday, Syria's defense ministry accused the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah of kidnapping three Syrian troops from Syrian territory in an ambush, the state news agency SANA reported, saying they were “taken to Lebanese territory and executed on the spot.”

            It also said that a photographer and reporter were injured on the Syria-Lebanon border after being struck by a “Hezbollah missile.”
    


            The Syrian defense ministry will take “all necessary measures following this dangerous escalation by Hezbollah,” SANA said.
    


            The Lebanese army said that two Syrians were killed at the border and another died in hospital, and that the three bodies were handed over to Syria.
    


Hezbollah denied involvement in the border clashes, the Lebanese state news agency NNA reported, saying it “has no connection to any events taking place within Syrian territory.”
    


            In response, Lebanon's presidency said Monday that tensions on the country's frontier with Syria “cannot go on.”
    


            “What is happening on the eastern and northeastern borders cannot go on, and we will not accept its continuation,” the presidency said on X, adding that President Joseph Aoun has instructed the military to respond “to the source of fire.”
    


            If confirmed to have been conducted by Syria, the attack on Lebanon would mark rare action by Syria's new government on one of its neighbors. The country's leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has repeatedly said he wants to maintain stability with Syria's neighbors and has so far refrained from responding to repeated Israeli strikes on his country.
    


            The clashes are a sign of growing tensions at the Lebanon-Syria border, northeast of the Beqaa valley, where predominantly Shiite Lebanese villages have seen skirmishes with Syrian soldiers in recent weeks.
    


            Syria's new government is led by former Sunni-Islamist militants who ousted the regime of Iran-allied Bashar al-Assad late last year. Shiite Hezbollah had intervened in Syria during the country's civil war to help Assad fight the Sunni militants.

Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire — a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year.

But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets or rising recession risks because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say. 

Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called ""correction"" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday.

The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say.

""First of all, you aren't alone — a lot of people are panicking,"" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action."" 

The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report.

""Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings,"" noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. ""One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics."" 

Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account. 

It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say. 

Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time. 

""How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically — all of that is completely valid to consider,"" TIAA's Ornstein said. 

But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment. 

""Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have"" to manage that risk, he noted.

Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement. 

But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said.

""Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 — they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover"" before they retire, he noted. ""But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years.""

He added, ""We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change.""

In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan. 

More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research has found.

Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said.

""Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,"" he said. When markets head south, ""It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments."" 

For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries. 

And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund. 

Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.

""The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,"" she said. ""Now is the time to find out how to build that up.""

Big four firm EY is set to lay off dozens of senior partners in its most significant redundancy plan in decades amid a slowdown in consultancy spending.

According to The Sunday Times, the accountancy and consultancy business, which welcomed its new UK boss at the start of the year, will be making a fresh round of job cuts.

One big four rival told The Sunday Times that in recent weeks, 10 EY partners had contacted them seeking work.

EY currently has 894 equity partners and 757 non-equity partners, which jointly own and manage the firm, though the latter group do not share in its profits.

Insiders also told The Sunday Times that a small number of EY's equity partners will be converted into non-equity partners, though they will not be the focus of the cost-cutting plan.

“We continually assess the needs of our business and make adjustments when required,” a spokesperson for EY told City AM.

The news comes after Anna Anthony began as managing partner of EY's UK and Ireland business at the start of the year, having previously led its UK financial services arm.

EY employs some 20,000 people in the UK and has struggled with a slowdown in consultancy spending, both from private businesses and imminent plans from the government to slash spending on outside consultants.

In December, it was revealed that EY was cutting 150 roles in its UK consultancy division, after revenue in the arm dropped four per cent.

In October, EY reported its weakest annual revenue growth in 14 years, coming in at just 3.9 per cent across the firm.

Redundancies were made among managers, senior managers and directors, which are the highest-paid roles below partner level.

In 2024, the UK Big Four firms made over 900 redundancies, as clients struggling with tighter monetary conditions reduce spending on costly external advisers.

A quarter of British 18-24 year olds have considered leaving the workforce in the last year in a sign of the increasing impact of economic inactivity spreading across the UK.

Among all UK workers, 10 per cent are currently actively considering leaving work for an extended period, with a further 20 per cent having considered leaving in the last year, data from PwC revealed.

The news comes as a staggering 90 per cent of employers state that they are concerned about a rising wave of economic inactivity.

Economic inactivity, which includes those who are not seeking work or unavailable to work, climbed to 22 per cent of working-age adults last year, according to ONS data.

In PwC's survey of over 300 firms, six in ten businesses said they had seen an increase in employees leaving the workforce.

“Economic inactivity is a very real problem for people and businesses. As well as the cost to individuals, businesses are understandably concerned about the direct impact on productivity and financial performance,” said Marco Amitrano, senior partner of PwC UK.

Indeed, 81 per cent of employers said productivity has been impacted by economic inactivity, with 77 per cent stating people leaving the workforce had been affecting financial performance.

Despite mass fears around inactivity, employers were reluctant to fix the problem themselves, with 57 per cent revealing they would be worried to recruit someone who had been inactive.

37 per cent associated inactivity with people “gaming the system”, though most believe the largest barriers for people returning to the workforce are skills and education gaps.

PwC identified two main reasons for those considering becoming economically inactive: mental health issues and unfulfilling work, with the former being the most important for young workers.

Despite stating they were considering more support, the survey found a clear mismatch on what employers were planning to offer, as they highlighted benefits such as company car schemes rather than culture or health support.

“If we are serious about reducing economic inactivity and contributing to the government's ambition of economic growth, then we need joined-up action not only helping people back into work, but more importantly stemming the flow of people out of the work,” added Katie Johnston, local and devolved government leader at PwC.

“This is not an issue for government alone, it needs close collaboration between central and local government, health and education providers and employers.”

PepsiCo said Monday that it is buying prebiotic soda brand Poppi for nearly $2 billion.

While soda consumption has broadly fallen over the past two decades in the U.S., prebiotic sodas, fueled by industry newcomers Poppi and Olipop, have won over health-conscious consumers over the past five years.

The category's growth makes it attractive for Pepsi and its rival, Coca-Cola, which recently launched its own prebiotic soda brand, Simply Pop. Pepsi had reportedly aimed to launch its own functional soda under its Soulboost brand, but it canceled those plans, likely paving the way to a deal with Poppi.

Pepsi said it plans to acquire the upstart Poppi for $1.95 billion. The deal includes $300 million of anticipated cash tax benefits, making the net purchase price $1.65 billion.

Pepsi will also have to make additional payments if Poppi achieves certain performance milestones within a set time frame after the acquisition closes. The company did not say when the deal is expected to close, pending regulatory approval.

Poppi's founders Allison and Stephen Ellsworth launched the brand back in 2018, the same year that Olipop was founded. Poppi's formula includes apple cider vinegar, prebiotics and just five grams of sugar.

By 2023, Poppi's annual sales reportedly crossed $100 million.

The company recently made its second straight Super Bowl appearance with an ad during the big game, demonstrating both its deep pockets and a desire to reach an even wider audience.

But as Poppi's sales have grown, it has also attracted backlash for its health claims. For example, the company faced a class action lawsuit that alleged that its drinks were not as healthy as its packaging claimed. Poppi and the plaintiff moved to settle the suit on Friday for $8.9 million, according to court filings.

For its part, rival Olipop was valued at $1.85 billion during its latest funding round, which was announced in February. In 2023, Olipop founder and CEO Ben Goodwin told CNBC that soda giants PepsiCo and Coca-Cola had already come knocking about a potential sale.

Oops, something went wrong

Elon Musk and Sam Altman finally found a common area of agreement — that a trial to settle their differences over the future of ChatGPT creator OpenAI should begin in December.

The proposal came in a joint court filing on Friday from Musk, Altman, OpenAI, and other named defendants, including Microsoft (MSFT). They asked for a two-week trial beginning Dec. 8.

A judge has ultimate discretion over whether to grant the joint request, though the California federal district court judge overseeing this case, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, is likely to agree on a date that both sides want.

The expedited battle is intended to weigh Musk's claims that Altman and OpenAI breached various agreements by planning to convert the artificial intelligence startup into a for-profit enterprise. He tried and failed to get a judge to approve an immediate injunction stopping the conversion.

Musk helped co-found OpenAI with Altman in 2015 by donating $45 million to the startup, which Musk claims was contingent on OpenAI remaining a nonprofit organization.

Musk parted ways over disagreements regarding how to move forward with the venture. He started a competing AI company called xAI. Musk alleges that allowing OpenAI to continue pursuing for-profit status would cause ""irreparable harm"" to Musk, xAI, investors, and the public.

Gonzalez Rogers, the judge overseeing this case, has made it clear she wants at least part of the dispute to go to trial.

“Something is going to trial in this case,” she told lawyers for Musk, OpenAI, and Microsoft in January.

On March 4, she even proposed an expedited trial for the ""fall of 2025."" The judge carved out some claims in Musk's lawsuit that likely won't go to trial until 2027 or 2028, including allegations that the defendants violated antitrust laws and that Altman violated laws prohibiting self-dealing.

Musk and Altman both told the judge they were in favor of a trial on the expedited claims in December. But that's where their agreement ends.

The parties disputed which of Musk's claims should go forward in the expedited trial and asked the judge to clarify. OpenAI also asked the judge to specify which claims remained open to defendant challenges.

According to Musk, the court should include his claim that OpenAI breached its duties as a charitable trust and its duty to operate in good faith, along with three claims alleging OpenAI entered into and violated a contract with Musk to remain a nonprofit.

According to Musk, Altman also breached laws against unfair competition by communicating a ""fund no competitors"" edict to OpenAI's current and prospective investors and permitting interlocking board positions between OpenAI and Microsoft.

OpenAI and the defendants deny those claims.

OpenAI asked the judge to include a broader set of Musk's claims, requesting that the trial also address his allegations of fraud, false advertising, breach of fiduciary duty, and civil racketeering violations.

Microsoft said it took no position on the scope of the expedited proceedings or the proposed case schedule but that it would ask to participate if claims against it were included in the December trial.

Microsoft also noted that the company requested a dismissal of all Musk's claims against it and that the court had yet to resolve its request.

The defendants have called Musk's allegations ""false"" and claimed he has no legal basis for blocking OpenAI's for-profit conversion.

Altman claims Musk wanted to fold OpenAI into his for-profit electric vehicle company, Tesla (TSLA), so that Tesla could provide it with additional funding.

Musk and a group of investors have since offered to purchase OpenAI for $97 billion. Gonzalez Rogers said in her ruling that the offer cut against Musk's claim that OpenAI's conversion to a for-profit business would cause Musk irreparable harm.

Musk named LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Microsoft executive Dee Templeton as defendants, claiming they illegally served as directors of both OpenAI and Microsoft at a time when the two companies were competing in the AI market.

Hoffman has since resigned from the nonprofit's board. Templeton is a nonvoting observer.

""I have significant concerns with Microsoft having put two members or two people on the board,"" Gonzales Rogers has said. ""Whether or not they were voting — they were still information-sharing.""

While Gonzales Rogers said some of Musk's claims would be fast-tracked for trial, she denied his request for an injunction that would have temporarily blocked the defendants from carrying out plans to turn the artificial intelligence charity into a for-profit business — and from transferring any material assets owned by OpenAI or its subsidiaries, including intellectual property.

As of October 2024, Microsoft had poured $13.75 billion into OpenAI.

Nvidia (NVDA) investors have had an un-Nvidia-like year so far.

Shares of the AI chip darling tanked 10% as investors fret over exposure to China in President Trump's trade war and possible overbuilding of AI infrastructure. The company's cautious first quarter margin outlook did little to ease worries.

The stock is below its key 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving average, a major sign of lost momentum among traders.

""I guess you can call it a healthy consolidation [in Nvidia],"" Evercore ISI technical strategist Rich Ross told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).

Ross has been studying market technicals for more than 30 years. In 2024, Institutional Investor ranked Ross No. 1 in his field for the seventh straight year. He was named to Institutional Investor's All-America Research team for the 10th year in a row.

Important technical indicators such as the relative strenth index (RSI) suggest Nvidia's stock is oversold, Ross said. The RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a stock's recent price changes in a bid to estimate overbought or oversold conditions.

Yahoo Finance data shows that Nvidia's present RSI is at 47, below the 63-or-so level reached when the stock hit a record high in early January of this year around CEO Jensen Huang's keynote at the Consumer Electronics Show.

""I think the next move is up in Nvidia,"" Ross added.

To be sure, there is a catalyst to get Nvidia's stock working up and to the right again.

Huang has it within his power to get the year back on track on March 18 at the company's must-watch annual GTC event and in a financial analyst meeting on the following day. The event is being held in San Jose, Calif.

 

Huang will have to deliver on several fronts at the event, experts say.

First, he must provide intricate details on how much more powerful Nvidia's next-generation chip Rubin is than the current gold standard in Blackwell.

Two, an update on the total AI addressable market opportunity for Nvidia is important, as investors have worried about AI infrastructure overbuilding.

And three, Huang would be wise to share offsets in the business to its China operations that are likely to be harmed by the Trump administration's trade war.

""While market volatility and China headlines could pressure the stock in the near-term, we still believe fundamentals will eventually prevail with stock below its historical trough 25x price-to-earnings ratio,"" Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya wrote.

Arya rates Nvidia a Buy with a $200 price target, which assumes about 68% upside from current price levels.

Netflix (NFLX) stock rose about 4% in midday trading on Monday after MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman upgraded shares to Buy from Neutral and boosted his full-year price target to $1,100 from $850 prior.

""Netflix has won the streaming wars. Case closed,"" Fishman wrote in a note to clients. ""But where does the company go from here? How much more runway for growth is ahead? Despite all of Netflix's recent success in reinvigorating growth, we believe its engagement will allow the company to better monetize and unlock greater profits in the years ahead.""

Netflix stock has struggled in recent sessions as a broader market sell-off continues to slam high-flying tech names. Shares have fallen over 10% from the 52-week highs they reached just one month ago, when the stock was trading well above $1,000 a share.

But Fishman sees brighter days ahead, crediting the ""Netflix flywheel"" when it comes to the company's ability to expand margins.

In his note, the analyst said Netflix can afford to spend more on content due to its vast number of subscribers, which currently sits at nearly 302 million globally. As a reminder, the company will no longer reveal subscriber data beginning in its 2025 reporting cycle.

""Because it has more content, it drives better engagement, leading to more subscribers and possibly better pricing power in a virtuous cycle,"" Fishman said. ""This is the enduring power of Netflix's first-mover advantage in streaming.""

And with the company beginning to scale its two-year-old ad tier, a new runway of growth has been unlocked, according to the analyst.

Earlier this year, the company hiked subscription costs across its various streaming tiers in the US, including the ad plan, which still remains one of the cheapest tiers on the market.

Management said it decided to raise prices, as its content ""has never been better,"" with more movies and TV shows expected throughout 2025. Sports and live events have also become staples within the Netflix ecosystem.

In November, the Jake Paul and Mike Tyson match attracted over 108 million global viewers, becoming the most-streamed sporting event of all time. For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers.

Similarly, the NFL games averaged around 30 million viewers. According to Netflix, it was its most-watched Christmas Day ever in the US. The company will continue to double down on sports amid the recent debut of WWE Raw. Rumors have also swirled the company could bid on UFC rights next.

""Despite all of Netflix's success to date, we think a still underappreciated aspect of Netflix's scale is its ability to better monetize its engagement in the years ahead,"" Fishman said.

In 2024, Netflix posted a record-breaking year, which included revenue growth of 16% as operating margins surged 600 basis points to nearly 27% — that's about 300 basis points higher than its guidance at the outset of the year.

Plus, the company added 41 million global subscribers last year, above the 36.6 million it added during the COVID-induced surge of 2020.

Password-sharing crackdowns helped aid those subscriber figures, and although the analyst expects the benefits of those crackdowns to slow in the near term, the company should continue to see subscriber upside from its content slate, with its ad tier serving as a longer-term catalyst for capturing new users.

The ad tier should also alleviate some pressure if the macroeconomic environment further deteriorates. Looking ahead, the company expects its ad business to double in size this year, previously noting ""a top priority in 2025 is to improve our offering for advertisers.""

And according to a MoffettNathanson analysis of time viewed from Nielsen compared to 2024 US revenues by platform, Netflix still has the opportunity to raise prices. The company's $0.40 of revenue per hour viewed pales in comparison to the likes of Paramount+ (PARA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), suggesting the company is under-earning relative to its peers.

""Yes, the current macroeconomic environment is uncertain and largely no one is impervious to a weakening consumer, but this analysis gives credence to the idea that Netflix still has ample runway ahead to take additional price increases in the US in the years ahead,"" Fishman said.

Overall, the analyst expects Netflix's operating margin to reach 29.5% in 2025 before eventually hitting broadcast-like margins of 40% by the year 2030.

Risks to those estimates include a failure to successfully build out and scale advertising revenues, along with an inability to further raise prices. Additionally, any material slowdown in subscriber growth coupled with a rapid increase in content spending would also pose threats to the downside.

Wall Street analysts who cover Netflix have a median price target of just around $1,090 a share with 44 Buy ratings, 13 Holds, and just two Sells, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates.

Oops, something went wrong

Investor disillusionment with President Trump's economic agenda continues to mount. The surprising message from Trump and his top advisers: Bring it.

Two months into Trump's presidency, stocks are down, and Trump and the investing community are unfriending each other. Wall Street expected the businessman-president to push market-friendly policies and put a floor under asset prices. Instead, Trump has imposed import tariffs more aggressively than anybody expected and dismissed the inevitable adverse reaction in markets.

Stock reversals highlight the whiplash. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) index hit a new high on Feb. 19, marking the moment of peak optimism in Trump 2.0. But Trump continued to amp up tariff threats that investors mistakenly interpreted as symbolic. By mid-March, new tariffs were in place on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, plus steel and aluminum from everywhere. And more tariffs are coming, Trump says. By March 13, the gloomy realization that the Trump trade war is real pushed stocks down 10.1% from the Feb. 19 peak, a market correction.

Trump's advisers are now signaling that Trump won't ride to the rescue. ""Corrections are healthy,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on March 16. ""I'm not worried about the markets.""

Chris LaCivita, co-manager of Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, was more blunt. He told Politico recently that investors worried about stock declines are ""a bunch of bedwetters,"" and added, ""There's a lot of shock therapy going on right now. It's very fast. It's a lot."" LaCivita doesn't work in the administration, but as a Trump insider, he's familiar with the president's thinking.

Trump himself has made a similar point. ""You can't really watch the stock market,"" Trump said on March 9, amid a sell-off. He also dodged the question when asked if he was worried his policies might cause a recession, which spooked markets even further.

Read more: What is a recession, and how does it impact you?

If the goal is to dissuade investors that Trump prioritizes the stock market's performance — as he seemed to during his first term — it's working. ""Trump 2.0 has signaled a reduced reliance on the stock market as a success barometer,"" investing firm Evercore ISI explained in a March 16 analysis. ""We attribute Trump 2.0's initial impacts to ... a President demonstrating a higher threshold for tolerating economic pain.""

Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Bluesky, or sign up for his newsletter.

Markets are now assessing just how far to backpedal. When Trump took office two months ago, many investors believed there was a ""Trump put"" that would keep stocks buoyant. The theory then was that Trump would intervene however necessary to forestall a sharp decline, whether that meant pulling back from tariff threats or taking other steps to stanch any bleeding.

The debate now is whether the Trump put has disappeared completely or merely been delayed. The Trump message tilts toward delay. After Bessent dismissed correction concerns, for instance, he said, ""Over the long term, if we put good tax policy in place, deregulation and energy security, the markets will do great.""

Some investors agree. Piper Sandler, for instance, has for several months been forecasting that the S&P 500 index will end the year at 6,600, which would be a robust 17% gain from current levels. The tariff tumult of the past several weeks hasn't changed the firm's outlook.

While Trump's tariff policies are a headwind, it's highly likely Congress will pass a huge package of tax cuts and tax-cut extensions by the end of the year, which would be market-positive. Other forecasters have trimmed their outlook for stocks while still expecting solid gains from current levels.

There's one final cautionary note for anybody trying to guess how Trump's actions will affect stocks: The president doesn't have as much control over markets as many people think. If Trump's trade war snowballs into a recession, for instance, falling profits and rising unemployment could swamp any action Trump could take to right the ship. It might still be a bit too early to claim the bedwetters are wrong.

Tesla stock (TSLA) is dropping on Monday after a rough few weeks for the automaker. The stock is down more than 6%. Shares of the EV maker dropped 8% last week alone, and have now fallen for eight straight weeks, with the company shedding hundreds of billions in market value.

Driving the news today is a report out of China, one of the company's most important regions. Per the company's website, Tesla is offering a free trial of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) autonomous software on the mainland, but it's not enough to quell investors' fears, however.

The deal — which runs from March 17 through April 16, isn't just limited to new buyers but is open to any owner whose Tesla is equipped with the latest hardware computer, software, and mapping data, according to a Tesla statement to its users, reported by Reuters.

Tesla's issues with self-driving in China are well known. The company has struggled with data collection from the vehicles in China because of the government's data privacy laws, which prevent Tesla from sending data collected in China to its servers in the US.

During Tesla's Q1 earnings call, when asked about the FSD rollout in China, CEO Elon Musk said difficulties remain. ""We do have some challenges because ... they currently don't allow us to transfer training video outside of China. And then the US government won't let us do training in China. So, we're in a bit of a bind there. It's like a quandary.”

Tesla is working with Chinese partners like Baidu to improve its mapping data by integrating Baidu's mapping information along with lane marking and traffic signal locations into its FSD, Reuters reported last week.

This development is a marked change for Tesla's strategy with self-driving, which relies on visual data alone to evaluate road conditions and markings, by integrating non-visual data for use with FSD.

Tesla's FSD is also considered less advanced than rival software seen in Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Xpeng, and others. BYD, the biggest EV brand in China, inked a deal with DeepSeek AI to co-develop new autonomous technology with its “God's Eye” advanced driver assistance system, a major threat to Tesla.

Looking big picture, challenges in China come on top of difficulties the company is facing in Europe, as well as brand erosion Tesla is seeing in the US.

In addition to new, more cost-competitive products challenging Tesla sales, many of Tesla's troubles stem from Musk's behavior.

As head of the White House's controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, Musk has seen his standing slide among Americans as protests have gained steam at Tesla showrooms in the US. Musk's meddling in German and UK politics by supporting far-right parties has also hurt his standing in those regions.

Official confirmation of Tesla's global sales will come in early April when the company reports first quarter deliveries.

JPMorgan is the latest investment bank to cut its delivery forecast for the company. Analyst Ryan Brinkman now expects Q1 deliveries of 355,000, down 8% year over year and down 28% from the 495,000 reported in Q4. Brinkman's new estimate is substantially lower than the firm's prior estimate of 444,000 and 15% below the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 418,000, he said.

In cutting the firm's price target to $120 from $130 (one of the Street's lowest), Brinkman didn't mince words.

“We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly, with perhaps the closest example being the decline in sales of Japanese and Korean brand vehicles in China in 2012 and 2017,” which stemmed from deep trade disputes, Brinkman said.

Oil's recent descent has prompted Goldman Sachs analysts to lower their price target for the year, in part due to expectations of softer economic growth amid President Trump's tariff policies.

The firm reduced its December 2025 forecast for Brent crude oil by $5 (BZ=F) to $71 per barrel.

Brent prices have fallen more than 3% year to date. Initiatives by the Trump administration to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine and efforts for a potential nuclear agreement with Iran have eased supply worries. Meanwhile, some economists have cut their growth forecasts amid a string of disappointing data and uncertainty over Trump's tariff policies.

“The selloff mostly reflects a shift in market focus from downside risk to Russia and Iran supply to softer US GDP growth,” Goldman Sachs' Daan Struyven wrote.

Struyven and his team expect oil demand will grow less than expected, ""incorporating slower US GDP growth on higher tariffs.""

Last week, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from all countries. The European Union responded with retaliatory levies against the US.

More US tariff plans are expected to be announced in early April.

Goldman Sachs analysts also anticipate higher OPEC+ supply next quarter.

Earlier this month, futures fell after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) surprised Wall Street by announcing it would bump up production in April as a first step toward unwinding its production cuts.

On Monday, West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CL=F) jumped around 1% to trade above $67 per barrel. Brent also gained roughly 1% to trade above $70.

The gain came after the US indicated it would continue to launch an offensive against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels until their shipping attacks in the Red Sea stopped.

Nvidia (NVDA) stock slid more nearly 2% midday Monday ahead of the AI chipmaker's annual GTC conference on March 18, where CEO Jensen Huang is expected to debut the company's upcoming AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, and a new AI superchip, Vera Rubin.

Monday's move follows an 8% climb last week. The chipmaker's shares rose more than 5% Friday alone as the stock began to recover from a post-earnings rout in which Nvidia led ""Magnificent 7"" stocks lower amid a tech-driven market downturn.

Huang teased that he would unveil more about Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin at GTC during the company's post-earnings call on Feb. 26.

""Come to GTC, and I'll talk to you about Blackwell Ultra, Vera Rubin, and then show you what's ... after that,"" Huang told analysts.

Read more: How does Nvidia make money?

Nvidia has officially scaled production of its current-generation Blackwell AI servers in ""the fastest product ramp"" in its history after they were delayed a quarter amid reports of overheating and glitches. Its Blackwell products generated $11 billion in revenue for Nvidia during the company's fourth quarter. Huang said overcoming the challenges of scaling the current-generation Blackwell systems will make it easier for the company to ramp up production of Blackwell Ultra.

""This time between Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, the system architecture is exactly the same. It's a lot harder going from Hopper to Blackwell because ... the chassis, the architecture of the system, the hardware, the power delivery, all of that had to change. This was quite a challenging transition,"" he said in the post-earnings call. Hopper is the GPU Nvidia launched prior to Blackwell.

""But the next transition will slot right in. Blackwell Ultra will slot right in. We've also already revealed and been working very closely with all of our partners...”

Huang confirmed in the call that Nvidia is slated to launch Blackwell Ultra in the second half of this year.

Other chip stocks, including Samsung (005930.KS), Dell (DELL), AMD (AMD), and Arm (ARM), rose Monday ahead of GTC.

In addition to Blackwell Ultra and Rubin, Nvidia is also expected to discuss the company's simulation technologies and more. During last year's event, Nvidia highlighted its latest software efforts around humanoid robots.

""We ... expect Mr. Huang to update thoughts on evolving AI workloads and provide incremental commentary on emerging areas of AI development such as Physical AI and Robotics,"" wrote Stifel analyst Ruben Roy in a note on Friday.

The bottom-line outlook is more than just a little blurry for liquor makers if a trade war on alcohol commences.

Trump has threatened a 200% tariff on European wine, champagne, and spirits if the European Union moves forward with a 50% tariff on American whiskey. The EU's tariff was unveiled in response to new steel and aluminum tariffs by the Trump administration and is expected to go into effect on April 1.

Liquor giants Brown-Forman (BF-B) and Diageo (DEO) have a lot to lose if the situation escalates.

Jack Daniels and Woodford Reserve whiskey maker Brown-Forman could see $0.36 per share in earnings wiped out if the EU's tariffs on whiskey go into effect, Evercore analyst Robert Ottenstein estimated in a new note on Monday. Brown-Forman sources about 20% of its sales from the EU and UK, with an 80%/20% split between the two regions.

Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet

Not helping Brown-Forman is that it gets 7% of its sales from Mexico and 1% of its sales from Canada — a 25% tariff applied to both countries could hit earnings per share by $0.07.

""We are pleased that [European Union] President von der Leyen and Trade Commissioner Šefčovič expressed a desire to negotiate with the U.S. and are hopeful the two sides will reach a constructive resolution before the tariffs take effect on April 1. The tariff conversation is bigger than Brown-Forman and our industry, and it's evolving rapidly,"" a Brown-Forman spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.

Things aren't much brighter for Johnny Walker scotch producer Diageo, which had already been struggling fundamentally in the lead-up to the trade war.

Diageo has said about 9% of its US sales is scotch. Ketel One and Tanqueray, made in Europe, represent 5% of sales, Ottenstein estimates. The company stands to lose $0.04 a share for every 25% tariff applied.

A 200% tariff on European-made alcohol would wallop Diageo to the tune of $0.28.

Similar to Brown-Forman, Diageo is exposed to tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Roughly 45% of the company's US sales come from Canada (mostly Crown Royal) and Mexico (tequila). Assuming the company could mitigate some of the blow by changing supply chains and price hikes, Ottenstein thinks Diageo's earnings per share would be hit by $0.04.

Ottenstein also laid out several factors that could weigh on each company besides the raw application of tariffs:

Boycotts or the removal of non-domestic brands from shelves could drive more significant headwinds for liquor makers. Reports from Canada suggest that some consumers are avoiding American-made alcohol.

The spirits pricing environment is ""fragile,"" which could make it difficult for liquor makers to offset tariffs.

Beer could benefit as its relative affordability rises compared to tariffed spirits and wine.

Shares of the liquor giants have begun to price in potential severe tariff-related headwinds. Brown-Forman and Diageo shares have shed 21% and 17% in the past three months, respectively, according to Yahoo Finance data.

Listen: Sen. Ted Cruz on Texas tariff impact

Investors keen on playing the alcohol space as a defensive trade in an uncertain broader market have rotated into beer names.

Beer companies such as Sam Adams and Budweiser are seen as having less relative exposure to the trade than liquor makers.

Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) shares and Boston Beer (SAM) are up 24% and 4% year to date.

Soda giant Coca-Cola (KO) has also caught a bid, with shares up 11% this year. Rival PepsiCo (PEP) has outperformed the liquor makers as well, with its stock only down 2% on the year.

Nvidia (NVDA) kicks off its annual GTC conference on March 18 with a keynote by CEO Jensen Huang from the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif. The event, which runs through March 21, will feature workshops and training for developers and engineers, panels and discussions related to AI and robotics, and exhibits from companies showing off how they're using Nvidia's products in the real world.

Huang is expected to debut the company's latest flagship AI chip: the Blackwell Ultra. A souped-up version of Nvidia's existing Blackwell chip, Blackwell Ultra should get a performance boost over last year's chip to further speed up training and running AI models.

We should also learn more about Nvidia's next-generation GPU platform, dubbed Rubin, and the successor to its Grace line of CPUs, Vera. The combined superchip will be called Vera Rubin, named for the American astronomer, and will take the place of the current Grace Blackwell superchip at the top of Nvidia's hierarchy of AI processors.

During Nvidia's fourth quarter earnings call, Huang teased that he'd also discuss the follow-up to Rubin. Nvidia, like most chip companies, is known for providing a broad look at its roadmap to help customers and developers prepare for their upcoming products.

In addition to Nvidia's future chips, Huang will dive into the company's latest software updates around its CUDA platform, simulation technologies, and more. During last year's event, Haung talked up Nvidia's software efforts around humanoid robots.

And with the company set to host a panel dedicated to the topic, you can expect the CEO to provide even more details about Nvidia's push into the humanoid robotics race.

The company will also host its first Quantum Day during GTC, which will include a panel discussion between Huang and executives from quantum computing companies including Alice & Bob, D-Wave (QBTS), IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti (RGTI), and SEEQC.

Huang made waves in January when he said practical quantum computers are still between 15 and 30 years away from becoming a reality, sending quantum computing stocks lower. Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) each announced their own quantum computing chips over the past few months, driving increased interest in the technology.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai says practical quantum computers are likely five to 10 years away.

Predicting when future technologies will reach maturity is a fraught exercise, and even quantum computing scientists are torn over when a quantum computer will prove truly useful. Still, the conversation between Huang and leaders at quantum companies should prove interesting.

Nvidia is contending with a host of issues ranging from fears over potential tariffs on semiconductors imported to the US to additional export controls on GPUs destined for China.

Then there's the rise of DeepSeek's R-1 AI model, which the Chinese company said it trained using less-powerful Nvidia chips. That has fed into Wall Street's growing apprehension over AI spending and a return on those heavy investments in the technology by companies including Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta.

Shares of Nvidia were off 13% year to date as of Thursday. Still, the company's stock price is up 28% over the past 12 months.

Huang, however, has pushed back against those fears, saying that ""thinking"" AI models like DeepSeek's provide better responses to users' queries when they run on more powerful chips. Chances are the CEO will bring up his thoughts on the topic during his keynote.

There's a $124 trillion elephant in the room for many American families — and it's time for those money talks to take place.

“The face of those who hold that wealth is changing dramatically,” Edward Jones CEO Penny Pennington told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (see the video above or listen below).

In 2024, baby boomers, defined as those born between 1946 and 1964, hit what is called ""peak 65,"" referring to the average age of retirement. An estimated 11,400 Baby Boomers will reach 65 each day in 2025, representing about one-fifth of the population. One logical thing on the list is tackling the family estate.

The subject of money can elicit plenty of familial tension. Plenty of personal finance surveys show that when it comes to money, whether it's negotiating a salary or discussing an inheritance, many people prefer to avoid the conversation entirely.

An avoidant approach, however, is a mistake. One study found that 38% of Gen Z-ers and 32% of millennials expected an inheritance of money or assets, while 22% of baby boomers planned to leave an inheritance.

For families slated to take part in the ""Great Wealth Transfer,"" starting that conversation doesn't have to be a heavy lift.

“What's important in the conversation today is to talk about the legacy that a family is leaving,” Pennington said. “How they developed those assets, that wealth, what they were thinking about [and] about their relationship with money.”

And a productive conversation can make a big difference in attitude about family and money. A recent study released by Fidelity revealed that 56% of parents hadn't had the difficult money conversation with their children, but 81% said they would have benefited from having a discussion.

“Teaching the next generation about this is part of family legacy,” Pennington said.

 

Noting that her firm sometimes serves clients made up of four or even five generations, she added, “Helping them move through this process as a family is a very rewarding thing for us to be able to do.”

When gathering together to talk about wealth transfers, Pennington advised touching on topics with heirs such as their values and experiences, how they develop their relationship with money, and the kinds of things they want to invest in.

Before bringing up the inheritance issue at the next family dinner, however, it might be wise to seek out a third party, such as a professional, according to Pennington.

“This is where a great financial adviser comes into play,” she said. “They take a little emotion out of this with a family.”

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) has entered correction, falling 10% from its February all-time highs as political uncertainty has driven fears over the market outlook. 

""There's been a sentiment shift,"" Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert told Yahoo Finance. ""The sentiment and the client and investor focus has completely swung upside down versus where we started the year.""

Entering 2025, the consensus on Wall Street called for the US economy to grow at a healthy pace and lead to continued outperformance of the US equity market against the rest of the world. Now, the prevailing market fear is that President Trump's current economic policies — namely tariffs, federal job cuts, and strict immigration — could further slow economic growth. This has prompted several economic research teams to lower their GDP forecasts, some strategists to cut their year-end S&P 500 targets, and stocks around the rest of the world to outperform the US market.

Still, few are calling for an overall lackluster year in US stocks. In a note to clients last week, Yardeni Research cut its 2025 year-end S&P 500 target from 7,000 to 6,400, which represents a roughly 14% increase from current levels. Notably, the forecast didn't come with a projection for lower earnings growth this year. Instead, the Yardeni team is now just assuming the S&P 500 won't return its record-high valuation seen entering the year.

""We still think earnings growth is going to be good,"" Yardeni Research chief markets strategist Eric Wallerstein told Yahoo Finance. ""There hasn't been a lot that's actually fundamentally changed about the economy. It's more so just uncertainty is weighing on [valuation] multiples.""

Read more: What is a recession, and how does it impact you?

To Wallerstein's point, while views on the economic outlook have soured, most economists and equity strategists aren't actually calling for a recession. And some have even argued that since the S&P 500 has sold off so far on the growth concerns, the market's rerating may be overdone. BlackRock's chief investment and portfolio strategist for the Americas Gargi Chaudhuri told Yahoo Finance her team remains ""overweight US equities.""

""We're not really worried about a recession yet,"" Gargi Chaudhuri said. ""So if there was a concern around recession, the conversation that we would be having would be a little bit different right now. This is just a pullback from some of the price to perfection that we had in the beginning of the year coming into this year, and this is a healthy pullback.""

Research from Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick shows 10% corrections not only happen quite frequently but often end up being the main event instead of extending to a bear market, defined by a 20% drop from an all-time high.

Detrick's work shows that since World War II, the S&P 500 has experienced 48 corrections. But only 12 of those corrections have turned into bear markets, meaning 75% of the time, a correction doesn't spiral all the way down to a bear market.

""We do not see a bear market coming,"" Detrick told Yahoo Finance. ""Early in the post-election year, choppiness is normal and that's kind of what's happening.""

The swift nature of the recent pullback is also typically a good barometer for how the index bounces out of a correction, according to BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski. In a research note on Friday, Belski highlighted that outside of the pandemic, no correction since World War II that happened as quickly as the current one has led to a bear market.

""These types of corrections that happen this fast go right back up and recover just as fast, if not more,"" Belski told Yahoo Finance. He added that this makes him ""very comfortable"" with his 6,700 year-end target for the S&P 500.

""In terms of fundamentals, they're still flashing green, not yellow, not red,"" Belski said.

 Despite BTC's price falling below $80,000 last week, Strategy's latest BTC buy was the smallest ever announced by the firm. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy, the world's largest public corporate Bitcoin holder, has announced its smallest Bitcoin purchase on record.

Strategy on March 17 officially announced its latest 130-Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition, bought for around $10.7 million in cash, or at an average price of roughly $82,981 per BTC.

The latest Bitcoin purchase was made using proceeds from the “STRK ATM,” a new Strategy program looking to raise up to $21 billion in fresh capital to acquire more BTC.

Strategy's new 130-BTC buy is the smallest one ever recorded since the company announced its first purchase of 21,454 BTC for $250 million in August 2020.

With the new purchase, Strategy and its subsidiaries now hold 499,226 BTC, acquired at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $33.1 billion and an average purchase price of around $66,360 per BTC, including fees and expenses.

After purchasing 130 BTC, Strategy still needs to acquire 774 BTC to reach a total holding of 500,000 BTC.

According to the Strategy website, the company's Bitcoin yield now stands at 6.9%, significantly lower than its 15% target for 2025. 

Despite Bitcoin's price falling to multimonth lows below $80,000 last week, Strategy's latest buy is significantly smaller than its most recent purchases, making it the smallest ever announced BTC purchase by the firm.

Prior to the latest purchase, the smallest BTC purchase by Strategy was a 169-BTC purchase in August 2024, according to official records by Strategy.

So far in 2025, Strategy has acquired 51,656 BTC in seven announced acquisitions.

After spending roughly $4.4 billion on its seven Bitcoin purchases in 2025, Strategy recorded a BTC gain value versus the dollar of $2.6 billion year-to-date.

Strategy's “BTC $ Gain” indicator, which tracks the dollar value of BTC gain calculated based on the market BTC price in a certain period, is now 74% away from the company's target of $10 billion in 2025.

 Bitcoin's price could surge to $120,000 by July or August as hedge fund accumulation further strengthens the bullish outlook for BTC price. 

Bitcoin's (BTC) stochastic RSI has printed a bullish cross with a history of preceding sharp price rebounds. 

Stochastic RSI tracks momentum based on price movements relative to their range over a given period. This classic indicator operates between 0 and 100, with values above 80 considered overbought and below 20 deemed oversold.

A crossover of the blue %K line above the orange %D line from an oversold region technically suggests growing upward momentum. 

Historical fractals show that each time the weekly stochastic RSI made the bullish cross, Bitcoin underwent sharp price recoveries within three to five months. Its gains have averaged at around 56% during such rebounds, ̛including rallies that extended beyond the 90%-return mark.

That includes a roughly 90% rally from November 2022 lows, 92% gains in late 2023, and a staggering 98% move into Bitcoin's recent all-time high of around $110,000 in January 2025.

If history repeats, Bitcoin could see another parabolic rise by July or August, aligning with previous stochastic RSI bullish crosses that delivered outsized returns. 

Market analyst Merjin the Trader says Bitcoin's price can reach at least $120,000 if the Stochastic RSI fractal plays out as intended.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's bullish reversal outlook receives further cues from its 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave in the chart above) at around $77,230. 

The 50-week EMA wave has served as a strong accumulation zone for traders since October 2023.

In case BTC's price breaks decisively below the 50-week EMA, it could head toward the next support target at around the 200-week EMA (the blue wave), near $50,480, down approximately 40% from current prices.

Another bullish sign comes from hedge fund accumulation during the ongoing price correction.

Global crypto hedge funds are increasing their Bitcoin exposure, as seen in the latest rolling 20-day beta to BTC, which has surged to a four-month high. This suggests that institutional investors are buying into the dip, positioning themselves for potential upside.

Beta measures how closely hedge fund returns track Bitcoin's movements. When beta rises above 1.0, it indicates that the fund rises more than BTC's price. Conversely, when the beta drops below 1.0, the fund moves less than Bitcoin.

The beta is now at a 4-month high, meaning hedge funds believe the recent Bitcoin dip is a buying opportunity and expect higher prices ahead, reinforcing the $120,000 price outlook as discussed above.

As Cointelegraph reported, the $120,000+ is becoming a popular target for summer 2025.

 A new bill in Brazil offers to regulate voluntary salary payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, requiring employers to pay at least 50% of the pay in the Brazilian real. 

Brazilian lawmakers are considering new legislation that would officially authorize employers to pay salaries to employees using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Federal deputy Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Bragança has introduced a bill proposing regulation of crypto payments for wages, remunerations and labor benefits.

Filed on March 12, the bill PL 957/2025 legalizes voluntary and partial salary payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) while also requiring employers to proceed with a part of the pay in the national currency, the Brazilian real.

Preview of the draft bill PL 957/2025 by Luiz Philippe de Orleans e Bragança (translated via Google). Source: Camara.leg.br

Orleans-Braganza, a descendant of Brazil's former royal family, is serving his second term as a federal deputy for São Paulo and supports Truth Social, the social media platform owned by US President Donald Trump.

In the proposed legislation, Orleans-Braganza asked lawmakers to prohibit employees from paying full salaries in crypto, capping such payments at 50%.

“The payment of salaries exclusively in virtual assets is prohibited,” except for cases involving expatriate employees or foreign workers, under the terms of regulations by the Central Bank of Brazil.

An excerpt from the proposed bill PL 957/2025 (translated via Google). Source: Camara.leg.br

The bill also allows full crypto payments by “independent service providers,” subject to certain contractual provisions.

Otherwise, the share of the payment in the Brazilian real may not be less than 50% of the employee's total salary payout. 

The conversion of the amount paid into crypto must follow the exchange rate officially established by an institution authorized by the Central Bank of Brazil.

According to Orleans-Braganza, the introduction of crypto payment salaries in Brazil has the potential to boost the financial technology sector and attract crypto investment in the local economy.

Additionally, the measure “reinforces the principle of autonomy of will, allowing workers and employers greater freedom to decide on their contractual relations, without prejudice to fundamental guarantees,” the bill reads.

The proposal aims to follow successful crypto payment implementation in many global jurisdictions, including Switzerland, Japan and Portugal, Orleans-Braganza mentioned, adding:

While some global jurisdictions allow Bitcoin use in payments, many countries — like Turkey and Russia — prohibit citizens from using any cryptocurrency as a means of payment.

El Salvador — the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 — allows voluntary payments in crypto but no longer allows tax payments and any government fees in crypto following a deal with the International Monetary Fund.

Separately from the crypto salary news in Brazil, the Brazilian government has recently pushed a new initiative to facilitate BRICS transactions using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, according to a March 12 report by Valor International.

 The ETH price slump continues due to weakening network activity and a declining TVL, as a classic chart pattern points to a further downside for Ether. 

Ether's (ETH) price has been consolidating within a roughly $130 range over the last seven days as $2,000 remains strong overhead resistance.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that ETH price oscillates within a tight range between $1,810 and $1,960.

Ether price remains pinned below $2,000 for several reasons, including declining Ethereum's weak network activity and decreasing TVL, negative spot Ethereum ETF flows, and weak technicals.

The underperformance in Ether's price can be attributed to investors' risk-off behavior, which is visible across the spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETH outflows from these investment products have persisted for more than two weeks.

US-based spot Ether ETFs have recorded a streak of outflows for the last seven days, totaling $265.4 million, as per data from SoSoValue.

At the same time, other Ethereum investment products saw outflows totaling $176 million. This brings month-to-date outflows out of Ether ETPs to $265 million, in what CoinShares's head of research, James Butterfill, described as the “worst on record.” 

He noted:

To understand the key drivers behind Ether's weakness, it is essential to analyze Ethereum's onchain metrics.

The Ethereum network maintained its leadership based on the 7-day decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. However, the metric has been declining over the last few weeks, dropping by approximately 30% in the last seven days to reach $16.8 billion on March 17.

Key weaknesses for Ethereum included an 85% drop in activity on Maverick Protocol and a 45% decline in Dodo's volumes.

Similarly, Ethereum's total value locked (TVL) decreased 9.3% month-to-date, down 47% from its January high of $77 billion to $46.37 billion on March 11.

Lido was among the weakest performers in Ethereum deposits, with TVL dropping 30% over 30 days. Other notable declines included EigenLayer (-30%), Ether.fi (-29%), and Maker (-28%).

Meanwhile, Ether's technicals show a potential bear flag on the four-hour chart, which hints at more downside in the coming days or weeks.

A bear flag is a downward continuation pattern characterized by a small, upward-sloping channel formed by parallel lines against the prevailing downtrend. It gets resolved when the price decisively breaks below its lower trendline and falls by as much as the prevailing downtrend's height.

ETH bulls are counting on support from the flag's lower boundary at $1,880. A daily candlestick close below this level would signal a bearish breakout from the chart formation, projecting a decline to $1,530. Such a move would represent a 20% descent from the current price.

The relative strength index is positioned in the negative region at 48, suggesting that the market conditions still favor the downside.

The bulls will attempt a daily candlestick close above the flag's middle boundary at $1,930 (embraced by the 50 SMA) to defend the support at $1,880. They must push the price above the flag's upper limit of $1,970 to invalidate the bear flag chart pattern.

 South Korea's central bank says it has yet to discuss or review a potential Bitcoin reserve, despite recent calls from some lawmakers and crypto lobbyists for the country to do so. 

The Bank of Korea says it is taking a “cautious approach” to potentially including Bitcoin as a foreign exchange reserve.

Officials from the Korean central bank said in a March 16 response to a written inquiry that they have not looked into a potential Bitcoin (BTC) reserve, citing high volatility. 

Responding to a question from Representative Cha Gyu-geun of the National Assembly's Planning and Finance Committee, central bankers said that they have “neither discussed nor reviewed the possible inclusion of Bitcoin in foreign exchange reserves, adding that “a cautious approach is needed,” according to the Korea Herald.

“Bitcoin's price volatility is very high,” the central bank noted, before adding that “in the case of cryptocurrency market instability, transaction costs to cash out Bitcoins could rise drastically.”

Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin prices have swung wildly between $98,000 and $76,000 before settling at current levels of around $83,000 in a 15% decline since Feb. 16, according to CoinGecko. 

The decision comes amid increasing global discussions on the role of crypto assets in national financial strategies, sparked by US President Donald Trump's executive order earlier this month establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile.  

At a seminar on March 6, crypto industry lobbyists and some members of Korea's Democratic Party urged the country to integrate Bitcoin into its national reserves and develop a won-backed stablecoin. 

However, the Bank of Korea emphasized that its foreign exchange reserves must have liquidity and be immediately usable when needed, as well as a credit rating of investment grade or higher, criteria that Bitcoin does not meet, in its opinion. 

Professor Yang Jun-seok of the Catholic University of Korea concurred, stating, “It is appropriate for foreign exchange to be held in proportion to the currencies of countries with which we trade.”

Professor Kang Tae-soo from the KAIST Graduate School of Finance commented on the US being likely to leverage stablecoins rather than BTC to maintain dollar hegemony before adding, “Whether the IMF will recognize stablecoins as foreign exchange reserves in the future is important.”

Earlier this month, South Korea's financial regulator examined the Japanese Financial Services Agency's legislative trend toward crypto assets as it mulls lifting a ban on crypto exchange-traded funds in the country.

 Bitcoin bulls appear ready to make a run at the 200-day SMA, which could pull BTC price toward $92,000 and reinvigorate altcoins. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has largely stayed above $80,000 since March 11, indicating that the bulls are not waiting for a deeper correction to buy. However, the failure to propel the price above $86,000 shows that the bears have not given up and continue to sell on rallies.

CoinShares' weekly report shows that cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) witnessed $1.7 billion in outflows last week. That takes the total five-week outflows to $6.4 billion. Additionally, the streak of outflows has reached 17 days, marking the longest negative streak since CoinShares records began in 2015.

It's not all gloom and doom for the long-term investors. CryptoQuant contributor ShayanBTC said that investors who purchased Bitcoin between three and six months ago are showing an accumulation pattern. Historically, similar behavior has “played a crucial role in forming market bottoms and igniting new uptrends.” 

Will buyers succeed in catapulting Bitcoin above the overhead resistance levels? How are the altcoins placed? Let's analyze the charts to find out.

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) is in a strong corrective phase. The fall to 5,504 on March 13 sent the relative strength index (RSI) into the oversold territory, signaling a possible relief rally in the near term.

SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The bears will try to halt the recovery in the 5,670 to 5,773 resistance zone. If they succeed, it will signal that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. That heightens the risk of a fall to 5,400. The bulls are expected to defend the 5,400 level with all their might because a drop below it may sink the index to 5,100.

On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day exponential moving average (5,780) will signal strength. The index may then climb to the 50-day simple moving average (5,938).

The weak rebound off the 103.37 support in the US Dollar Index (DXY) suggests that the bears have kept up the pressure.

DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

Sellers are trying to sink the index below 103.37. If they can pull it off, the decline could extend to 102 and thereafter to 101.

Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above 104, it will signal that buyers are trying to make a comeback. The index could rise to the 20-day EMA (105), which is likely to attract sellers. If buyers do not cede much ground to the bears, the prospects of a break above the 20-day EMA increase.

The positive divergence on the RSI suggests that the bearish momentum is weakening. If buyers drive the price above the 20-day EMA ($85,808), the BTC/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($92,621).

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply from the 200-day SMA, it will indicate that the bears are trying to flip the level into resistance. The pair may slide to $80,000 and next to $76,606.

Ether (ETH) has been trading between $1,963 and $1,821, signaling a lack of aggressive buying at current levels.

If the price dips below the $1,821 to $1,754 support zone, it will indicate the resumption of the downtrend. The ETH/USDT pair may then nosedive to the next significant support at $1,550.

This negative view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA ($2,107). The pair could ascend to the 50-day SMA ($2,514), where the bears are likely to sell aggressively. However, if the bulls pierce the 50-day SMA resistance, the pair may rally to $2,857.

XRP (XRP) turned down from the 50-day SMA ($2.51) on March 15, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.

The 20-day EMA ($2.34) has flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. The XRP/USDT pair could remain stuck between the 50-day SMA and $2 for some time.

If the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 50-day SMA, it will clear the path for a potential rally to $3. Instead, a break and close below $2 will complete a head-and-shoulders pattern. The pair may then tumble to $1.28.

BNB (BNB) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($598) and rose above the 50-day SMA ($620), indicating that the correction may be ending.

The 20-day EMA has started to turn up, and the RSI has risen into positive territory, indicating a slight advantage to the bulls. If the price sustains above the 50-day SMA, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to $686 and eventually to $745.

The 20-day EMA is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA will signal that the bears have seized control. The pair may then descend to the strong support at $500.

Solana (SOL) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($139) on March 16, signaling that bears are aggressively defending the level.

The SOL/USDT pair could drop to $120 and then to $110, where buyers are expected to step in. If the price rebounds off the support zone, the bulls will again try to drive the SOL/USDT pair above the 20-day EMA. If they manage to do that, the pair could climb to $180.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues lower and breaks below the support zone. That may start a downward move to $100 and subsequently to $80.

Dogecoin (DOGE) has been gradually rising toward the 20-day EMA ($0.19), which is an important near-term resistance to watch out for.

If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, it suggests that bears are selling on every minor rally. That heightens the risk of a break below the $0.14 support. If that happens, the DOGE/USDT pair could plunge to $0.10.

Contrarily, a break and close above the 20-day EMA indicates that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($0.23) and later to $0.29. A break and close above $0.29 suggests that buyers are back in the driver's seat.

Cardano (ADA) has been trading below the 20-day EMA ($0.76) since March 8, but the bears have failed to sink the pair to the uptrend line. This suggests that selling dries up at lower levels.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

Buyers will have to drive the price above the moving averages to start a sustained recovery. The ADA/USDT pair could climb to $1.02, where the bears may again mount a strong defense.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the moving averages, it will suggest that bears remain in control. That increases the likelihood of a drop below the uptrend line. If that happens, the pair may plummet to $0.50.

Pi (PI) has been gradually sliding toward the $1.23 support, which is likely to attract buying from the bulls.

If the price rebounds off $1.23 with strength, the PI/USDT pair could attempt a move back toward $1.80. Sellers are expected to pose a strong challenge at $1.80, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could rally to $2 and thereafter to $2.35.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from $1.80, it will signal a range formation. The pair may swing between $1.23 and $1.80 for a while. Sellers will strengthen their position on a break below $1.23. The pair may then collapse to the 78.6% retracement level of $0.72.

 ETH price failed to rebound from its recent sell-off, and matters could get worse if the altcoin falls under $1,900. 

Ethereum's native token, Ether (ETH), continues to consolidate under $2,000, which some traders view as a psychological level. Ether price slipped below this range on March 10, and the altcoin continues to trade at its lowest value since October 2023.

Ether price has also lost market value with respect to other major altcoins, with XRP price reaching its highest level against ETH in five years on March 15. 

The real question among investors is whether ETH is capable of recapturing a portion of its recent losses or whether traders will capitulate if the price falls below $1,900.

According to data from IntoTheBlock, a data analytics platform, Ethereum holders accumulated 3.56 million ETH between $1,900 and $1,843, with an average price of $1,871. Therefore, the current accumulation value currently stands at $6.65 billion. This indicates that ETH's price has a strong support level between $1,900 and $1,843, which can potentially act as the bullish reversal zone.

However, if Ether drops below $1,843, data points to the possibility of rising capitulation fears. Capitulation is a market sentiment where investors tend to panic, selling their positions at a loss during a sharp market correction. If ETH consolidates for a prolonged period under $1,843, the likelihood of a deeper correction increases exponentially. 

Below $1,843, the size and volume of ETH accumulation are significantly lower, which further illustrates the importance of the $1,900 to $1,843 support range. 

Similarly, the percentage of Ethereum addresses under profit dropped to its lowest level since the start of the decade. It is the lowest value since December 2022 at just under 46%.

A low percentage of profitable addresses has historically indicated a price bottom for Ethereum. Given the high ETH accumulation and fewer profitable addresses, these factors may act as bullish signals. As a result, the likelihood of Ethereum consolidating below $1,843 in the long term is decreasing.

Hitesh Malviya, the founder of DYOR crypto, said it is not a “great time to bearish on ETH.” In an X post, Malviya highlighted the recent rise of real-world assets (RWAs) in the industry, with a 50.9% increase in growth over the past 30 days and an 850% yearly increase, with Ethereum and ZKsync capturing more than 80% of the total market share.

 The man who has been trying to recover a hard drive containing the private keys to 8,000 Bitcoin from a UK landfill site now plans to file an international human rights case. 

A UK man's bid to obtain a permit to search a landfill for his hard drive — holding private keys to 8,000 Bitcoin — has been rejected by the UK Court of Appeal.

“Appeal request to the Royal Court of Appeal: refused,” Howells said in a March 14 X post.“The Great British Injustice System strikes again… The state always protects the state,” the early Bitcoin adopter added before revealing his “next stop” would be the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

UK Royal Court of Appeal Judge Christopher Nugee knocked back Howells' application, stating that there was no “real prospect of success” and there was “no other compelling reason” as to why it should be heard, according to a March 13 filing shared with Cointelegraph.

Source: James Howells

Nugee's decision follows an earlier dismissal on Jan. 9 from High Court Judge Andrew Keyser, who similarly said there was “no realistic prospect” of Howells' case succeeding at a full trial.

In a note to Cointelegraph, Howell said his “last legal option” to exhaust is at the ECHR — where he will claim that the UK High Court and UK Court of Appeal breached his right to property and right to a fair trial under Article 1 of Protocol 1 and Article 6 of the ECHR.

The ECHR cannot overrule a UK court decision — however, a verdict in Howells' favor would call on the UK courts to consider whether its legislation was interpreted in a way that is compatible with the ECHR's provisions.

In a separate statement shared with Cointelegraph, Howells said he would file a claim to the ECHR in the “coming weeks.”

The court filings follow repeated rejections from the Newport City Council allowing Howells to search through the Docksway landfill — where Howells' former partner disposed of a bag containing the hard drive at the site in 2013.

Howells' 8,000 Bitcoin (BTC) is worth around $660 million at current prices. While few predicted Bitcoin would reach such heights back then, Howells' incident illustrates the importance of properly securing self-custodied crypto funds.

Howells also appears to be running out of time, as the Docksway landfill is reportedly set to shut down sometime during the UK's 2025-2026 financial year, BBC News reported on Feb. 9.

 The trademark application shows four use cases for the word mark, including for “downloadable software for custody of cryptocurrency.” 

Ripple Labs has filed a trademark application for the word mark “Ripple Custody,” indicating that the company behind the XRP (XRP) token is considering expanding its brand in the crypto custody space.

The filing notes four use cases for the word mark, including one that reads “Financial services, namely, custodial services in the nature of maintaining storage and possession of cryptocurrency […] for financial management purposes.”

Crypto custodians store and manage digital assets for individuals and institutions, aiming to minimize risks such as private key loss and security breaches. The demand for custody services has grown significantly in recent years, especially following the approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in 2024. Major players in this space include Coinbase, Citi and BNY Mellon, among others.

The trademark filing follows Ripple's launch of its custody service in October 2024. At the time, the company said the move sought to diversify its revenue streams beyond its payment settlement service.

A Ripple spokesperson declined to comment on the trademark filing.

Another use case listed in the trademark filing reads, “downloadable software for custody of cryptocurrency, fiat currency, virtual currency, and digital currency; downloadable software for transmission and storage of cryptocurrency, fiat currency, virtual currency, and digital currency.”

The use case may indicate that Ripple could be planning to launch a cryptocurrency wallet, either to support its native token, XRP, or a wider variety of digital assets. Currently, the company does not offer a crypto wallet. The wallet services offering would provide another revenue stream to Ripple by collecting transaction fees.

Companies already offering support for XRP and other cryptocurrencies include Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets, Trust Wallet, Exodus and many others.

 AI agents need to focus on utility over cryptocurrency issuance, as their cumulative market capitalization is down 61% from the peak $70.4 billion. 

Artificial intelligence agents need to prioritize their intrinsic utility, not the launch of their in-house native tokens to raise funds.

AI agent-related tokens have significantly declined over the past month, as their cumulative market capitalization decreased by over 21% to the current $27 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.

While their continued decline may be part of the broader crypto market correction, another reason could be a lack of focus on intrinsic utility, according to Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Zhao wrote in a March 17 X post:

“Launch a coin only if you have scale. Focus on utility, not tokens,” he added.

Zhao's comments come during a significant downtrend for AI cryptocurrencies, which lost over 61% of their peak $70.4 billion market capitalization in the three months since they started to decline on Dec. 7.

AI agents are gaining increasing interest thanks to their promise of increasing online productivity, streamlining decision-making processes and creating new financial opportunities.

AI agents are already executing autonomous transactions on the blockchain without direct human input.

The concept gained attention following a Dec. 16 post by Luna, an AI agent on Virtuals Protocol, which sought image-generation services.

Luna also received an X response from STIX Protocol,  another autonomous AI agent, which generated the requested images.

After the images were generated, Luna paid STIX Protocol's AI agent $1.77 worth of VIRTUAL tokens on Dec. 16, onchain data shows.

Yet, some of the demand for AI agents has since faded, as Virtuals Protocol's revenue fell 97%, Cointelegraph reported on Feb. 28.

 Move is now the best programming language for verifying the absence of bugs and checking for modifications and leaks, which is how most blockchains get hacked. 

Opinion by: Alex Nguyen, CEO at VibrantX

The Move programming language's origin is not super cypherpunk. Facebook (now Meta) created Move after the Libra/Diem team compared major smart contract languages (Bitcoin Script, Ethereum Virtual Machine bytecode languages) and decided their formidable in-house tech talent could make a new language built on years of private and public sector research.

The original team, including founders Mo Shaikh, Avery Ching, and their engineering team, left Facebook to continue as a fully independent, open-source project headed up by Aptos Labs and supported by the Aptos Foundation.

Importantly, Meta's failed Libra experiment left us with a programming language specifically designed for crypto finance. Move on Aptos is now open-source, and the Aptos Foundation is a commercially driven organization that welcomes builders from all backgrounds.

Move is now the best programming language for verifying the absence of bugs and checking for modifications and leaks, which is how most blockchains get hacked.

This verification relies on two key features of Move on Aptos: (1) “backward compatibility” and (2) the concept of an “auditor at runtime.” 

Move on Aptos is fast and cheap, creating a competitive user experience, especially for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Aptos aims for a high transaction throughput, with theoretical capabilities reaching up to 160,000 transactions per second (TPS) through its parallel execution engine, Block-STM.

Aptos' sub-second finality means transactions are confirmed quickly, enhancing the user experience in time-sensitive applications.

To be fair, other chains also have these qualities. Move on Aptos is, however, designed to be “backward-compatible.” 

Future upgrades won't disrupt existing projects. This helps developers feel more confident building long-term solutions without worrying about things breaking because of a Move upgrade. 

Move smart contracts are designed to be upgradeable without affecting the user experience, which is essential for mainstream adoption. This enables teams to implement bug fixes and new features with zero disruption. 

Recent: Crypto startups can't just rely on solid tech to win VC funding: OKX

Smart contract flexibility through Move on Aptos' specific security features results in better and faster product shipping. Being more flexible, Move on Aptos can quickly adapt to support new ecosystems.

Solidity contract hacks have been prevalent over the years. When building Web3 technology for markets worth billions or even trillions of dollars, it's crucial to have a security system that will protect projects from resource leaks, invalid memory access and other unauthorized modifications. 

As it was initially developed for Meta's Diem project, Move is designed for safety, resource management and performance, making it attractive for developers looking for a secure yet robust language for smart contracts.

When deploying code using Move, the code will be verified across several crucial coding conditions like proper resource management, type correctness and reference safety. No matter what happens to the code, it will be verified first to prevent any faulty or malicious smart contracts from running. 

This is the power of Move's built-in bytecode verification.

Renowned computer science pioneer Edsger Dijkstra noted, “Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!” 

Move's formal verification capabilities let developers actually prove that there are no bugs in specific code according to preset specifications. 

MoveVM is less battle-tested than Ethereum's virtual machine, but as Rushi Manche, founder of Movement Labs, has explained, Move requires much less code auditing. The MoveVM runtime can act as an “auditor at runtime.”

The verifier inside the MoveVM ensures that the transaction code is not harmful and that it cannot create, duplicate or destroy resources not allowed by the signer(s) of the transaction. In other words, MoveVM is an “auditor at runtime” rather than a human smart contract auditor. 

Today, Move on Aptos is more than just a smart contract language. Move on Aptos is the longest-standing, most recognized and widely used version of Move, boasting one of the fastest-growing developer communities and a rapidly growing ecosystem of infrastructure, tooling and projects.

Quickly verifying code before deployment created the conditions for the Move on Aptos ecosystem. From a flawed Web2 beginning, Move is now primed to grow DeFi.

 OKX says it has decided to pause its DEX aggregator service after consulting with regulators. 

Crypto exchange OKX has temporarily paused its decentralized exchange aggregator to prevent “further misuse” by North Korean hacking collective Lazarus Group.

“Recently, we detected a coordinated effort by Lazarus group to misuse our defi services,” said OKX on March 17.

“After consulting with regulators, we made the proactive decision to temporarily suspend our DEX aggregator services. This move allows us to implement additional upgrades to prevent further misuse.” 

The OKX helpdesk confirmed that the DEX aggregator was temporarily suspended for an “internal review and upgrade” but did not provide a timeline. 

It added that crypto wallet services will remain available to all customers, but it will “pause new wallet creation in select markets during this time.”

Source: OKX

On March 11, Bloomberg reported that European Union financial watchdogs were investigating the firm's DEX aggregator, called OKX Web3, and its wallet services for their alleged role in laundering funds from the Bybit hack.

“Over the past few days, we've faced targeted media attacks questioning our integrity and operations,” the firm stated in a blog post. It added that it “can't ignore the fact that these attacks are happening at a time when we are actively fighting against financial crime.”

According to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou, nearly $100 million from the $1.5 billion Bybit hack had been laundered through OKX's Web3 proxy, with a portion of the funds now untraceable.

OKX responded on March 11, stating that the “Bloomberg article is misleading,” saying that when Bybit was hacked, OKX reacted in two ways: by freezing associated funds from moving into its CEX, and developing the new hack detection features.

OKX stated that the goal is to ensure that explorers properly highlight the actual DEX processing trades “rather than mistakenly identifying our aggregator as the point of trade.”

The exchange has already deployed a “hacker address detection system” for its DEX aggregator in addition to a system to track the hacker's latest addresses and block them on its centralized exchange in real time.

“We already rolled out a lot of controls for OKX Web3 to fight with the misuse, including prohibited markets' IP blocking and real-time black address detection and blocking system,” said OKX CEO Star Xu on March 17.

The firm also clarified that the OKX Web3 DEX aggregator is not a custodian of customer assets, adding that its function is to provide access to liquidity across multiple protocols. However, “some have deliberately misrepresented our platform,” it said.

 A US federal judge found the CFTC had shown that Debiex, which marketed itself as a crypto platform, was actually a romance scam that stole around $2.3 million. 

Crypto platform Debiex has been ordered to pay around $2.5 million after it failed to respond to a US Commodity Futures Trading Commission suit accusing it of being a romance scam ring.

Arizona federal court Judge Douglas Rayes on March 13 granted the CFTC's earlier motion for summary judgment in its case and ordered Debiex to pay back around $2.26 million it stole from its customers, along with a civil penalty of nearly $221,500.

Judge Rayes said there was no evidence that Debiex's failure to respond to the CFTC was the result of “excusable neglect.”

The CFTC sued Debiex in January 2024, saying its staff ran a so-called “pig butchering” scam, where they initiated romantic relationships with customers over social media to gain trust to convince them to invest in the platform.

The scheme hooked five victims who deposited around $2.3 million in total onto Debiex, which the purported trading platform stole, the CFTC said.

A highlighted excerpt of Judge Rayes' order summarizing the CFTC's case against Debiex, Source: CourtListener

The CFTC also accused Zhāng Chéng Yáng of being a “money mule” for Debiex, whose crypto wallets were used to accept and steal victims' funds.

Judge Rayes granted a CFTC motion for default judgment against Zhāng on March 12, finding it adequately alleged he controls a crypto wallet with OKX “that received digital assets to which he had no legitimate claim.”

He said OKX was “voluntarily preserving” the crypto in Zhāng's account and ordered its contents, consisting of $5.70 worth of Tether (USDT) and nearly 63 Ether (ETH) worth around $119,500, to be transferred to an unnamed victim.

The CFTC said in its January 2024 complaint that Debiex's scheme saw its unknown managers target potential victims through social media to lure them to websites it had created marketing itself as a “Blockchain Network Decentralized perpetual contract trading platform” where users can conduct futures trading and “Mining transactions.”

Debiex's staff would present as females and built a rapport with victims through “continuous and repeated messaging and sharing purported pictures of themselves” while claiming to be “highly successful digital asset commodities traders,” the CFTC said.

Once an account was created and the customers sent over their crypto, the CFTC said Debiex would share “fictitious information” about customer balances, trading positions and profits.

“All of this information was most likely false,” the CFTC said. “The evidence shows that the Customers' digital assets were simply sent to numerous digital asset wallets in an attempt to obfuscate their destination.”

 Tokenized real estate introduces new means to ownership as blockchain technology is changing the rules of global property investment. 



Over the ages, property ownership has survived the fall of empires, endured technological revolutions and kept pace with shifting social tides.

The business of land and buildings has shown a remarkable knack for adaptation, and blockchain stands as a powerful tool for the real estate industry to address and overcome the challenges of the modern world.

Real estate — a market expected to hit $654 trillion by 2025 — has long been considered one of the most stable investment options. Yet, the barriers to investing remain high for the broader population. Starting with high upfront capital requirements, rigid regulations and protracted settlement processes, these challenges deter all but the most well-funded or persistent buyers. Additionally, the traditional property market is illiquid, often taking months or even years to complete a sale.

This is where blockchain — and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization — enters. Simply put, RWA tokenization in real estate is the process of converting ownership of a property or its related cash flows into digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens represent the value of the underlying asset in the form of absolute ownership of a single property to fractional shares or specific rights to rental income.

The key advantage of RWA tokenization is that it enables liquidity in an otherwise illiquid market — allowing tokens to be traded 24/7 across a global network — while enhancing transparency, security and efficiency.

However, potential adopters still face concerns about regulatory compliance, technological complexity and data authenticity — challenges that go well beyond simply digitizing a property deed. The full realization of RWA tokenization's potential requires real estate participants to navigate legal frameworks and industry standards, ensuring that everything from fractional ownership rights to security measures and investor protections aligns with regional and international regulations.

Mantra, a layer-1 blockchain built for RWA tokenization, stands at the forefront of bringing real estate business to blockchain by tokenizing property. Built on the Cosmos SDK, Mantra provides the necessary infrastructure, compliance features and liquidity solutions to bridge the gap between traditional assets and blockchain technology.

The platform was specifically engineered to address three core challenges in real estate tokenization:

Here's a closer look at how Mantra's toolkit simplifies the tokenization process for developers, institutions and individual investors:

Real estate is heavily regulated, with laws differing across jurisdictions. Rather than relying on cumbersome offchain processes, Mantra allows users to undergo Know Your Customer (KYC) verification within its blockchain environment with its Digital Identity (DID) system. Following a phased rollout, this system will issue a soulbound NFT to those undergoing the KYC process. Ensuring only verified users can transact will significantly reduce compliance hurdles.

🎙️INSIGHT: Tokenization went from rebellion to revolution, now it's the evolution of finance.At Consensus HK, @MANTRA_chain co-founder @jayantramanand shared how they built an L1 blockchain to power compliant, composable tokenization for real-world assets.In 2017,… pic.twitter.com/uvx21SRGBZ

Meanwhile, Mantra Token Service (MTS) includes features like freezing, seizing or burning tokens — vital for aligning onchain activity with real-world legal mandates. To avoid liquidity fragmentation — RWA liquidity being scattered across multiple networks — Mantra supports Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol, facilitating seamless asset transfer between blockchains.

As a manifestation of its commitment to compliance, Mantra applies to licenses where it operates. The project recently received a license to provide services as a virtual asset exchange, broker-dealer and management and investment servicer in Dubai from the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). As the first DeFi platform to achieve this, it signaled the start of a new regulatory era.

Regulatory compliance often goes hand in hand with daunting paperwork.

Mantra aims to streamline the time-intensive process long associated with regulatory compliance, with its DID system. New users undergo a KYC check just once, after which they receive a passportable identity confirmation that can be used across the ecosystem.

This identity binds them to a Mantra wallet address and mitigates the need for repeated verification. From there, the platform's user-friendly dashboard guides users through everything from token creation to asset management. The emphasis on simplicity empowers experienced investors and newcomers to participate in real estate tokenization without feeling overwhelmed by technical details or cumbersome red tape.

When a real estate developer seeks financing for a premium commercial complex, it can utilize the Mantra ecosystem in addition to traditional fundraising methods.

Real estate has the potential to massively benefit from tokenization thanks to its massive global market size and stability, as well as traditionally high barriers to entry. Transforming property ownership into blockchain-based tokens will improve access to liquidity, enabling investors to buy and sell real estate assets more easily, and in near real time. It also lowers the capital threshold for participation, attracting a broader range of investors and developers.

Real estate that is tokenized using the Mantra suite provides a secure and verifiable record of ownership and enables fractional ownership models at scale. It is a combination that signals an accessible and capital-efficient era of property investment and positions real estate as a frontrunner among RWAs moving onchain.

 Cryptocurrency scams can manifest in various forms, often preying on the lack of regulation and the complexity of blockchain transactions. You must be aware of common tactics used in cryptocurrency scams. These include:Phishing scams: Attackers send fraudulent emails or messages that mimic legitimate cryptocurrency platforms. Victims may be tricked into providing sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials.Ponzi schemes: Promises of high returns with little to no risk lure investors into schemes that eventually collapse, leaving many with significant losses.Fake ICOs: Fraudulent projects present a compelling investment opportunity, only to disappear after collecting funds.Rug pulls: In decentralized finance (DeFi), developers of a project could suddenly withdraw all funds from a liquidity pool, leaving investors with worthless tokens. This malicious act is called a rug pull, and it typically occurs after a project has gained enough momentum and unsuspecting investors have bought into it. Social media impersonations: Cybercriminals impersonate reputable influencers or customer support accounts. They use social media to solicit investments or send links that compromise security. Always cross-check identities through official channels.AI-powered scams: AI-powered scams in the crypto space involve advanced tools like phishing bots, deepfakes and exploit bots, which can automatically create convincing fake messages or manipulate platforms to steal funds. These scams are increasingly sophisticated, making it harder for users to spot fraudulent activities and putting digital assets at greater risk.

 Preventing future scams is as critical as recovering from one. Avoiding cryptocurrency scams is all about staying informed and cautious. Implement the following measures to reduce your risk:Do your homework: Before investing in any project or platform, take the time to research. Look into the team behind it, read the white paper and check out reviews from reputable sources. If you can't find clear, verifiable information or something feels off, trust your instincts and steer clear.Stay updated on scam tactics: The tactics used by scammers are constantly evolving. Familiarize yourself with common scams like phishing, AI-powered or impersonation scams. Following crypto news and joining reputable online communities can keep you informed about the latest warning signs.Question “too-good-to-be-true” offers: If someone promises sky-high returns with little risk, it's likely a red flag. In crypto, as in any investment, high rewards usually come with high risks. A legitimate opportunity won't pressure you with unrealistic promises.Verify websites and emails: Scammers often create lookalike websites and send fake emails that mimic trusted services. Always double-check URLs and email addresses, and if something doesn't match the official website or seems unusual, avoid clicking on any links.Secure your digital assets: Treat your crypto wallets like a personal safe. Use hardware wallets for long-term storage, enable 2FA on all accounts and never share your private keys or recovery phrases. Think of your private keys as the keys to your house — keep them secure and private.Take your time: Scammers love to create urgency with “limited-time offers” or “exclusive deals.” If you're being rushed into a decision, pause and do your research. Legitimate opportunities will still be available after you've had time to verify the details.Diversify your investments: Never put all your money into one asset or project. Diversification helps manage risk and protects you if one investment turns out to be less secure than expected.Seek trusted opinions: If you're unsure about an investment or an offer, ask for advice from knowledgeable friends or community members. Trusted crypto communities and forums can be great for getting second opinions — but always be cautious and cross-check the information.By staying vigilant, questioning deals that seem too good to be true and taking simple security measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to crypto scams. It's all about being cautious and making informed decisions. Your future self will thank you!

 The Wemix token plummeted by nearly 40% between the day of the attack and the company's breach announcement four days later. 

Wemix Foundation CEO Kim Seok-hwan said they had no intention of concealing a hack on its bridge, which led to over $6 million in losses.

In a press conference, Kim reportedly said there was no attempt to cover up the incident, even though the audience pointed out the announcement was delayed.

On Feb. 28, over 8.6 million WEMIX tokens were withdrawn due to an attack on the platform's Play Bridge Vault, which transfers WEMIX to other blockchain networks. The company only made an official announcement four days after the attack. 

According to Kim, the announcement was delayed due to the possibility of further attacks and to avoid causing panic in the market because of the stolen assets.

Wemix said the hacker broke into their system by stealing the authentication key for the company's service monitoring system of Nile, its non-fungible token (NFT) platform. 

After the theft, the hacker spent two months preparing before randomly creating abnormal transactions. The hackers attempted to withdraw 15 times but only succeeded with 13 withdrawals, taking away 8.6 million WEMIX tokens and selling them in exchanges outside South Korea. 

Kim explained that upon becoming aware of the hack, they immediately shut down their servers and began their analysis.

The executive added that they filed a complaint against the unidentified hacker with the Cyber Investigation Team of the Seoul National Police Agency. The Wemix CEO said the authorities had already started investigating the matter. 

Kim said that there was a risk in making a premature announcement. The CEO said that in a situation where the penetration method was not identified, they could be exposed to further attacks. 

Kim also reiterated that the market had already seen some impact from the sold assets, and they would risk panic selling if they announced it immediately. 

During the press release, the executive apologized to Wemix investors, saying that the disclosure delay was his call and that he should be held responsible if anything goes wrong. 

Despite the attempt to avoid causing market panic, the WEMIX token dropped by nearly 40% from the day of the exploit to March 4, when the company finally announced the hack. 

The price went from $0.70 on Feb. 27 to a low of $0.52 on Feb. 28. The price went down to $0.42 on March 4. At the time of writing, the crypto asset trades at $0.58, which is still 17% below its pre-hack price.

 The phony email says crypto exchange users have until April 1 to transfer their crypto into self-custody wallets — but it's a big scam. 

Crypto users have reported an increase in scam emails impersonating exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini. These fraudulent emails attempt to trick users into setting up a new wallet using pre-generated recovery phrases controlled by scammers.

In several examples posted to X, the email claims to be from Coinbase, asking users to transition to self-custodial wallets and providing instructions on downloading the legitimate Coinbase Wallet, giving a deadline of April 1 to make the switch.

However, it also provides pre-generated recovery phrases. Once users open a new wallet with those phrases and transfer funds, all the assets will be available to the threat actor, who could drain the wallet.

The email mentions a class-action lawsuit against Coinbase alleging it has sold unregistered securities, resulting in a court mandating users manage their wallets.

“Coinbase will operate as a registered broker, allowing purchases, but all assets must move to Coinbase Wallet,” the phony email says.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission dismissed its lawsuit alleging Coinbase was an unregistered broker and selling unregistered securities on Feb. 27.

Coinbase told Cointelegraph it is aware of the scam and pointed to its March 14 post to X, saying, “We will never send you a recovery phrase, and you should never enter a recovery phrase given to you by someone else.” 

Source: Coinbase Support 

Crypto exchange Gemini has also been spoofed with the same recovery phrase email scam, using the same tactics and claiming users need to set up a new wallet because of a recent court decision.

Gemini was being sued by the SEC for allegedly offering unregistered securities through its earn program. The regulator opted to end the legal action on Feb. 26.

Gemini didn't immediately respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment. 

Blockchain security firm CertiK's annual Web3 security report flagged crypto phishing attacks, which cost users $1 billion across 296 incidents, as the most significant security threat for 2024.

The email scams come as at least three crypto founders have reported foiling an attempt from alleged North Korean hackers to steal sensitive data through fake Zoom calls.

Scammers have been targeting crypto founders by offering a meeting to discuss a partnership opportunity, but once the call starts, they send a message feigning audio issues and a link to a new call that installs malware.

These days, Jon is able to be more present with his family now that the anguish of his severe depression is gone. 

Aidan Kahn

By Laura Sanders

5 hours ago

In the sixth episode of The Deep End, we'll look to the future for Jon and his family and for DBS research. The research is pushing ahead, with a clinical trial of DBS for treatment-resistant depression that's just begun. The first volunteer for that study had DBS surgery in early February. You'll also hear about a before-and-after situation for Jon and Barbara, one that involves the evolving meaning of a beloved song.

Laura Sanders: Previously on The Deep End.

Amanda: Like, I don't feel like it's, nothing I've done has ever changed who I am or my personality. Like, I'm still the same person. I'm just suffering more or less.

Jon: And so irritability for me was at like a six or a seven or an eight. Guess what? It's still at a six or a seven or an eight. And so, like, my perspective to them on that is it's not that the surgery didn't work. I guess I'm just like a cranky middle-aged dude now, right? Like, that just is what it is.

Barbara: Yeah, like you can't say his old self. There's, he never, he never like wasn't himself through this whole process, right? So it's just, he is more comfortable and happy and relaxed and productive and present and engaged. So the things that the disease was trying to steal from him, he's getting back. There isn't that cloud hanging over us.

Sanders: So now, several years out from their surgeries, the volunteers I talked with are back to their lives. In today's episode, we're looking ahead too, to what's next for Jon and his family, and what's next for DBS. I'm Laura Sanders, and this is The Deep End.

These days, the Nelson house is bright, full of light and laughter and kindness. When I visited, they kept offering me way too much coffee and they insisted on putting their cool lizard Lizzie on my arm. Jon also insisted on taking pictures of it so I could show my kids later. The Nelsons are having a good time.

Barbara: You have to laugh. You can't, you can't not laugh at this and or anything in my opinion. But my son, my middle son said to me after, right after, said, “You know, mom, if you're mad at dad, you can always hide the charger.” I was like, “Oh dude. That's too far. That is too far.” So yeah, we, we have a healthy sense of humor in our household, for sure. Like, we'll even joke, like, you know, we'll say something like, “Oh my God, you're crazy. I'm like, no, you're, like, really crazy.” But like, you know, so we like to joke about it.

Sanders: This family jokes about hiding Jon's charger and changing his settings. It's all part of their routine busting on each other for all sorts of things.

When I was there, their middle son rated Jon a 10 out of 10 on the embarrassment scale. I won't even tell you what he rated his mom. They joked about how us old people don't understand slang like rizz, and no cap and stuff that slaps. Their youngest son stumped everyone with a riddle: What's the only state that ends with a K? He didn't say and neither will I. So for now, the Nelsons aren't just looking ahead to better days. They're having them.

As I reflect on all the people who have talked with me for this story, I keep asking myself why. Why were they so generous with their time? Why did they choose to tell me, and now all of you, about some of the hardest moments in their lives? Barbara Nelson is a private person, but even so, she's been incredibly open about her family's struggles.

Sponsor Message

Barbara: It never occurred to me not to. It never occurred to me not to share our story. And I'm not like a super out-there person. Like, I'm like, I'm very open about things, but I'm sort of private too. But I feel like because we know that so many people are struggling, that the more we talk about it, the better our society is. A hundred percent, this is a shift in the right direction. And I just think it's really helpful to hear as either a caregiver or if sharing my story helps a partner be more empathetic or stronger or more resilient when trying to help, then that's really good. Because if you can let go of all the armor and the importance of the appearance that everything's great and perfect and actually take those steps, you can get better. And your life doesn't fall apart. We don't have less friends because we told people the truth. We have more friends probably. So I think that is, I never thought about why I might be willing to share our story. So off the cuff, I think that that's why. Because your life can get better. I remember hearing somebody say once, “Your secrets make you sick,” and I never forgot that. And I think it's true.

Sanders: Patient 001 has the same desire to let people know about his experiences, to demystify depression, to let people know that even in the bleakest times, there's hope.Patient 001: You're so frustrated because you're screaming out for help, and they just don't understand. I feel that's probably one of the reasons I'm talking to you, even though I want to do it anonymously. I really, I hope one day one kid reads what you're writing and then he finds DBS and he's cured because that's what I did.

Sanders: Amanda shared a similar perspective.

Amanda: I think sharing my story is important, because it helps other people see the way. It's kind of like a flashlight for people who are still in the dark. Like, “Here it is. I found it. Here's the way out.”

Sanders: Playing a role in this research was something that resonated with Amanda, too.

Amanda:  It's really meaningful to me. I feel like I'm participating in something, that I'm contributing to something that really matters. That someday, because of this study and because of other studies, is going to change the lives of other people in an incredibly profound way.

Sanders: Amanda's life has changed. That's clear when she tells me about one of her drawings that she did after DBS. 

Amanda: But you know the song “Somewhere Over the Rainbow?” It always irritated me because I'm like, “There is no “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.” It's a pipe dream, okay? Pretty song, but a pipe dream. And I was like, “I found somewhere over the rainbow.” And I was like, “You know what? I'm going to build a house here.” So I drew a picture of a rainbow and there's Cartoon Amanda and she has built a house on the rainbow. She's like peeking out the door.

Sanders: What's it, what's that place like, you know, if you could describe it, if you're, if so, okay, pretend you're showing me the picture and like, here's your house and what is that, what's that place? Like, what are the, what are the things about that place that make it over the rainbow?

Amanda: It's sunshine. So there's lightness and warmth and, and, and like literal lightness, like you're on a cloud. It sort of feels a little bit like that.

Sanders: These outlooks make clear the importance of hope. Of a belief that things can get better. A hope that the science will get better too, that our understanding of depression will get better, that it won't be like this forever. Neurologist Helen Mayberg's first paper describing DBS for depression appeared in the journal Neuron in 2005. We're 20 years out from that. DBS is still in the research phase. It is not an FDA-approved treatment available to people who might benefit.

Mayberg: It's that resignation of sorts that it isn't enough to do it, repeat it, follow people. It hasn't scaled.

Sanders: In its current form, DBS is not simple or easy, or even something that would be a good medical choice for a lot of people. That's what Mayberg means when she says it hasn't scaled. But science is often slow, and it almost never happens alone.

Mayberg: As a scientist, as a doctor, it's not my job to save the world. It's my job to save the people that I can save. And if I can only do so much, to know what I can do and know what I can't do, but I can't do everything, and I can't take on that responsibility. That's hubris and narcissism that I'd like to not claim.

Sanders: As advanced as the science is, there are still big questions to answer. Like why does DBS seem to work for some people and not others? How specifically does it change the brain? A new clinical trial announced in September of last year may help answer some of these questions. The medical technology company Abbott is funding a study that will include a hundred people with treatment-resistant depression. They'll be recruited from all around the United States. All of these volunteers will get DBS. For the first year, half of these volunteers will have electricity flowing, and the other half won't. And at the end of the trial, all of these volunteers will have the option of turning it on. The study has already started. On February 6th, a brain surgeon at Mount Sinai implanted a DBS device into the brain of the very first volunteer. This new clinical trial will hopefully clarify more about DBS and who it might work for. That's the question that Mayberg wants answered.

Mayberg: The variance is in human beings. The variance is who the person is that develops the depression. And everyone is different.

Sanders: One of the things scientists are looking for are markers, ways to tell when someone is having a bad day or actually relapsing. Jon and Amanda are participating in follow-up studies, searching for signs of recovery in their brains. Scientists are looking for these signals in their body language and facial expressions, and even in their voices. In one part of the experiment, Jon spent eight minutes twice a day recording his brainwaves, along with video journals and daily, weekly, and monthly surveys. From data like Jon's, Mayberg and her colleagues just described one such hallmark in the brains of six people who underwent DBS for depression. A collection of changes in brain behavior can indicate when a person has recovered. It's a small study, but it's progress, and here's the thing, a deeper understanding of what's going on in DBS could also point to the next kind of treatment. And that next, better thing might not even be DBS.

Mayberg: I'd like to spend my time trying to understand the biology of what we did, because it'd be a whole lot better if you didn't need brain surgery and an implant. And I'm not the one to build a new contraption or miniaturize it or make it Bluetooth compatible. That's for engineers and you have to have users to build more elaborate machines.

Sanders: Changing the behavior of neurons deep down in the brain from outside of the skull, it's a very, very hard thing to do. Scientists are trying to figure out how to do this without brain surgery. They're using electricity, light, ultrasounds, and magnets to get signals into the brain from outside of the head. Other approaches are miniaturizing the parts that do go inside the brain and coming up with easier ways to get them in there. One method, for instance, relies on these collapsible electrode grids that can be threaded up into the brain through the jugular vein in the neck. It's wild.

These approaches all have their drawbacks, but technology is always getting better. Just think about the first heart pacemaker. It was an incredible piece of technology, but it was giant and clunky. Today, the powerful device can be smaller than a matchbook, and it sits near millions of people's hearts, keeping them beating as they live their lives. The goal with DBS is similar: small, simple, seamless. For now, Mayberg says she's in “realistic” mode, trying to find out what's going to work for the most people. And getting there is a group effort.

Mayberg: And patients like Jon and Amanda and Emily, they're our teachers. They're our mentors. They're our collaborators. The most fun part of this as a clinician is to have the patients focus my attention, to figure out what they're saying. And then to actually get their feedback afterwards, there's not even words to describe that gift.

Sanders: As Mayberg reflects on her career, she's philosophical about what she and her colleagues have done and what's left to do.

Mayberg: This, this is never where I expected to be. But you're here, so step up.  Why wouldn't you step up? This is the experiment of a lifetime, you know? It's even, if you, if right the second after this call I had to stop, I wouldn't trade it for one second, but I'd sure like to see the last inning, right? And we're all in, I'm all in.

Sanders: The Nelsons are in a better place now. Their place is full of laughter, jokes, teasing, but in a nice way. There's a lightness to them, like Amanda's house over the rainbow. When I was visiting, their youngest son was twirling and gliding through the kitchen on inline skates, going around the loop. He made it two full loops before Barbara kicked him out. The Nelson house is full of hope for a future that's better than the past. Here's Barbara.

Barbara: It just feels good to just be now. I'm really happy at the job I'm in. I'm excited about traveling and spending more time with family and friends. And that's really what my focus is right now, and not trying to, like, advance in my career or have more. I just actually want less and just to like, there's just this like sense of, like I say a lot, like, nothing really bothers me anymore. Like, there's really very little that will, like, get under my skin, because I'm just so grateful for every moment. And when he had this surgery, I felt like, over those first few months was like, I don't know how this is going to end up, but we got this. Like, we got this happy time. And even if that's all we get, even if it was three months or six months of relief, that's good. That's cool. I'll take that.

Sanders: After his surgery, Jon sent Helen Mayberg an email that he shared with me. It was mostly a note to thank her for her work, for saving his life. But he told her about a before-and-after situation. Years ago, he was away at an inpatient treatment facility. And he and Barbara would both listen to this one song, “Amsterdam” by Coldplay. He read me the email. 

Jon: I could relate to it well to my situation, pre-surgery, about fading away, losing my mojo and just overall sadness, debilitating sadness. The sadness was warming and relatable to me, though. It wasn't a negative thing when I was sick.

Sanders: He could feel the pain and the rawness in the song, and it made him feel his feelings. Not in a bad way, but in a meaningful way. Now, after the surgery, after DBS, the song has changed for him.

Jon: I now still listen to it a bunch and it's changed into being about the joy of fighting through it all and coming out truly alive on the other side. It still captivates me, but with a new meaning and focus. Give it a listen. It's a beautiful song. Much love to all. Thank you for caring. Jon.

Sanders: That change, that shift in perspective, that shift in his life, didn't just happen to Jon. It happened to his whole family. With three kids and a packed schedule, Jon spends a lot of time in the car, shuttling kids to and from softball and field hockey, golf, basketball, ice hockey. On one of these drives, Jon and his youngest son were talking. He is still the emotional one. The kid who would crawl back up into Barbara's womb if he could. Jon's joke, not mine. He's the one who gets deep.

Jon: My son, you know, driving home the other day from hockey, I always, I always call it car talk with my, my families that I coach. I'm like, “Guys, when car talk with the kids, emphasize these points for the game or this or that.” And he just gets, I mean, we're in the car all the time because of hockey. But he was just like, “Dad, you know, like I, I'm so happy you just kept fighting for us.” Like, just these little comments that come out of nowhere. Like, oh my God, like, obviously they get it. They understand it. And it's just a trip.

Sanders: We're considering a bonus episode that addresses your questions, comments, and thoughts. Please send them to us at podcasts@sciencenews.org. If you or someone you know is facing a suicidal crisis or emotional distress, call or text the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988.

As we wrap up, I want to say a giant thank you to Jon, Barbara, Amanda, Emily and Patient 001. Thank you for talking with me and thank you for sharing your stories. Your perspectives opened a window into a world that a lot of us just look right past. Also, thank you for being so funny. I can honestly say that I didn't expect to laugh so much reporting a story about depression.

NASA's Dragonfly mission is due to land on Titan in 2034, giving us an unprecedented look at Saturn's largest moon – but it may also have to dodge wind-driven rolling boulders.

The mission, which will launch in 2028, includes a “rotorcraft” that will explore the moon from the skies. We have had only one up-close glimpse at Titan, thanks to the Cassini orbiter and Huygens probe, which reached the surface in 2005. That mission revealed fields of rounded boulders as well as radar-bright…

A newly-discovered spiral galaxy, dubbed the Big Wheel, formed just 2 billion years after the big bang – far earlier, considering its size, than astronomers thought possible.

Themiya Nanayakkara, at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia, says the discovery was an accident. He and his colleagues were looking for quasars, energetic regions at the heart of some galaxies, with the James Webb Space Telescope in November 2022 when a “large spiral galaxy popped up”.

Thousands of mysterious quakes on Mars that only happen during summer are unlike any known earthquakes, puzzling scientists.

Since NASA's InSight lander reached Mars in 2018, it has recorded thousands of marsquakes, including some surprisingly large quakes that indicate the planet is more seismically active than we first thought.

USAID Funding Saved Millions of Children's Lives. Recent Cuts Put It in Jeopardy

USAID investments significantly reduced deaths among children under age five and women of reproductive age, studies show

By Tanya Lewis edited by Dean Visser

Tigray people, fled due to conflicts and taking shelter in Mekelle city of the Tigray region, in northern Ethiopia, receive the food aid distributed by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) on March 8, 2021.

President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have made it their mission to slash funding and staff at federal agencies, and so far, this has perhaps been most damaging to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. As soon as he was inaugurated on January 20, Trump signed an executive order halting all foreign aid for 90 days. Weeks later the New York Times reported his administration planned to downsize the agency from more than 10,000 workers to 290. Most recently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the Trump administration was canceling 83 percent of USAID programs and folding the rest under the Department of State.

The cuts have been fast and sweeping. “We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,” Musk posted on February 3 on X (formerly Twitter), the social media site he owns.

The effects of these actions immediately ricocheted around the world, and they will continue to be felt for years to come. They will especially threaten young children and women, for whom USAID funding has been providing lifesaving basic medical services that have ranged from vaccines to treatments for diarrheal diseases to maternal health care. Studies show this funding has helped save the lives of nearly three million children under age five and at least one million women of reproductive age in recent decades, experts say.

Dismantling USAID endangers all of these gains. “This is like trying to pause an airplane in midflight and then subsequently firing the crew,” says Atul Gawande, former head of global health at USAID.

USAID has provided health funding and staff support to numerous countries worldwide. But measuring the effects of that aid—or the sudden lack of it—is a challenge. To do so, William Weiss, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who served as an advisor in the global health bureau at USAID until his agreement was recently suspended, and his colleagues created a model to quantify the effect of USAID funding from 2000 to 2016 on under-five childhood mortality for low- and middle-income countries. The study was published in January 2022 in Population Health Metrics.

Because teasing out the specific effects of USAID funding from that other aid work is very challenging, Weiss and his colleagues used a method called a “synthetic control” analysis to estimate childhood mortality retrospectively across a group of countries that did and didn't receive significant amounts of USAID funding. The researchers compared a “treatment” group of countries that received a high level of USAID funding for maternal and child health and malaria during the study period of 2000 to 2016 with a “synthetic control” group of similar countries that did not receive this level of funding.

The study found that countries that received above-average levels of USAID funding had, on average, 29 fewer deaths per 1,000 live births than the synthetic control group of countries that didn't receive funding. That works out to roughly 500 fewer deaths per day, Weiss says. Additionally, the researchers found that the more USAID funding countries received over time, the bigger the benefit was—suggesting a dose-response effect.

Amanda Montañez; Sources: “Estimating the Impact of Donor Programs on Child Mortality in Low‑ and Middle‑Income Countries: a Synthetic Control Analysis of Child Health Programs Funded by the United States Agency for International Development,” by William Weiss et al., in Population Health Metrics, Vol. 20, No. 1, Article No. 2; December 2022 (USAID funding effects data); World Bank (U.S. estimate)

“The message we were trying to send to leadership in the Congress was to say, ‘This is what you get when you significantly fund a country over a sustained period,'” Weiss says.

In a related preprint study posted online last August, Weiss, Gawande and their colleagues modeled the effects of USAID funding on mortality among women of reproductive age between 2005 and 2019. That study, which has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Global Health, found that for the years 2009 through 2019, countries that received a sustained high level of USAID funding saw a mortality rate reduction of 0.8 death per 1,000 women of reproductive age. This translates to about one million to 1.3 million deaths prevented, or four extra years of life expectancy, says Gawande, who is a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital, as well as a writer and public health researcher.

Amanda Montañez; Sources: “Accounting for Aid: Estimating the Impact of United States' Global Health Investments on Mortality among Women of Reproductive Age Using Synthetic Control and Bayesian Methods,” by Karar Z. Ahsan et al. Preprint posted to SSRN on August 27, 2024 (USAID funding effects data); “Mortality Rates among U.S. Women of Reproductive Age, 1999–2019,” by Alison Gemmill et al., in American Journal of Preventive Medicine, Vol. 62, No. 4; April 2022 (U.S. estimate)

With the Trump administration gutting USAID, many of these longevity benefits could disappear. And while the administration has claimed the cuts are meant to prevent government waste, Americans largely support foreign aid.

“This has always been extremely bipartisan,” Weiss says of foreign health aid. “Congress and their constituents [have long been] behind these programs saving children's lives, especially in poor countries, with interventions that were fairly cheap,” he says. “This is what the American people wanted, across ideological lines.”

The U.S. Department of State, which is now overseeing USAID, did not respond to a request for comment.

Troy Jacobs is a pediatrician and served as a senior medical adviser for maternal and child health at USAID for more than 17 years. “As a pediatrician, the whole reason that I joined USAID was that the solutions to some of the most wicked global health problems in maternal and child health are not totally within the biomedical space,” he says. Before he was terminated at beginning of February, Jacobs was working in Ethiopia to provide lifesaving maternal and child health care. “In countries like Ethiopia, where there's a high burden-of-disease bill for infectious diseases, as well as growing chronic diseases like mental health issues and things like that, there was so much work to be done—but we were making progress,” dramatically reducing mortality among children under the age of five, he says. Now all that work has been put on hold.Jacobs's colleagues in Ethiopia are telling him the cuts have caused a lot of hardship and confusion, he says. “And in that confusion, services are being delayed. People are not able to access resources,” he adds. “Globally, we're estimating 95 million people [have been affected by] the loss of basic medical services.”

The USAID cuts have affected more than just funding for children's and women's health. They have terminated the President's Malaria Initiative, which was protecting 53 million people from disease and death through the use of bed nets, diagnostics and treatments, according to Gawande. They have ended all work on tuberculosis, including funding for most TB treatment. And they have halted USAID contracts that administer funding from the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the landmark HIV program launched by then president George W. Bush in 2003 and funded with bipartisan support by Congress ever since. PEPFAR has been providing medication to 20 million people worldwide.

Anna Katomski was hired as a program analyst in the HIV/AIDS office at USAID's global health bureau, but she was laid off in late January after just two weeks. She was supposed to work on a PEPFAR-funded project called Maximizing Options to Advance Informed Choice for HIV Prevention (MOSAIC), with the purpose of scaling up HIV prevention for adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa. The project was aimed at testing various approaches to HIV prevention, including a long-acting injectable form of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

“So much of this work is either stopped because of USAID putting out its funding or will be stopped very soon,” Katomski says. And these long-acting medications have to be tapered off—you can't just stop them cold turkey and switch to a pill, she notes. This could leave girls and young women vulnerable to HIV infection. “If, say, one of these adolescent girls or young women engage in in unprotected sex, for example, with a person with a penis who has HIV, they are at high risk of contracting the disease,” Katomski says. “HIV incidence is going to soar.”

On March 5 the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Trump administration could not freeze about $2 billion in foreign aid. A federal judge later specified a date by which the administration had to pay back payments to USAID contractors for work that was already completed, but the decision doesn't address future payments.

The Supreme Court's ruling is important, but “the damage has already been done,” Gawande says. “Many of these organizations have already terminated most of their staff. They're barely standing as organizations, but getting their payments that are past due would at least divert bankruptcy and make sure people's pensions can be funded and things like that.” The question is what the Court will do now, he says, “because [the Trump administration has] dismantled the agency, and the ruling needs to be enforced somehow.”

New NASA Missions, Bonus Moons for Saturn and Whale Urine That Balances Ocean Chemistry

The EPA rolls back regulations, NASA launches two exciting missions, and we discuss the surprising way whale urine moves nitrogen across the ocean.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's get this week started with our usual science news roundup.

First, unfortunately, I need to update you on some troubling environmental news.

Last Wednesday the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, announced that the agency plans to get rid of or weaken many environmental rules and policies. Zeldin said the EPA could even pivot away from officially recognizing that greenhouse gases are bad for us.

Back in 2007 the Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants covered by the Clean Air Act and that meant that the EPA needed to determine whether these emissions by new motor vehicles were tied to air pollution that could harm the public, or if the science was too uncertain. Well, the science was certain. In 2009 the EPA officially determined that greenhouse gases threaten public health. Zeldin announced that the administration plans to reconsider these findings. In a video Zeldin posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, about the plans, he referred to the determination as…

[CLIP: Lee Zedlin on X: “The holy grail of the climate-change religion.”]

Feltman: It's important to note that since 2009 the evidence that greenhouse gas emissions put human lives in danger has only grown.

According to Zeldin, the EPA plans to take a series of 31 actions to change or eliminate environmental regulations. Now, the big headline is that sectors like power generation and the automotive industry could face fewer regulatory requirements around climate pollution. The agency is also considering going after rules related to hydrofluorocarbons, which are extremely potent greenhouse gases. Zeldin argued that these gases contribute to food inflation by forcing companies to use refrigerant systems that make food more expensive. Other agency targets include regulations around wastewater from coal plants, industrial release of mercury and other toxins, soot pollution, and clean water protections for rivers and wetlands.

In an EPA news release, Zeldin said the following about the proposed changes: ""Today is the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen. We are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion.”

E&E News by Politico reports that the EPA won't be able to do all of this at once. Overturning that 2009 finding on the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions will take at least a year. But there are plenty of environmental regulations the agency could roll back in the meantime. In recent days the EPA has canceled hundreds of grants and Zeldin has pledged to cut more than half of the agency's spending. Last Monday, Zeldin wrote in a statement that the EPA was “working hand-in-hand with DOGE,” which is overseen by Elon Musk. Last Thursday a federal judge ordered the U.S. DOGE Service to turn over records to 14 state attorneys general who allege that Musk's cost-cutting sweeps are violating the Constitution.

Meredith Hankins, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told E&E News that the breadth of the proposed EPA rollbacks was surprising. In summary, she said, “the vibes are bad.” We will definitely be keeping an eye on what the EPA is up to in the next few months.

But for now let's cleanse our palettes with some space news. Last Tuesday two NASA missions headed into space. One of those missions centers on a new space telescope called SPHEREx—no relation to SpaceX; it's short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer. Of course, NASA loves a good backronym. It's going to create a three-dimensional map of the sky every six months. The telescope will measure the distances between us and about 450 million other galaxies, in part to help understand how the universe rapidly expanded in the split second after the big bang.

Tagging along on the same flight was NASA's PUNCH, short for Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere. That mission, which comprises four suitcase-sized satellites, is going to study solar wind. And I bet NASA was pleased as punch to get two awesome missions up on the same ride. But I hope those satellites realized they were getting into like an Uber Pool situation.

In other great space news, Saturn is officially the mooniest planet in our solar system by a landslide. Last Tuesday the International Astronomical Union recognized the discovery of a whopping 128 new moons orbiting Saturn. That brings the planet's total up to 274, which is more moons than all the other planets in our solar system have combined—or at least the moons we know about, anyway. These findings, which relied on the use of the Canada France Hawaii Telescope to carefully watch Saturn's skies from 2019 to 2021, deepen the ringed planet's lunar dominance over Jupiter and its measly 95 moons. If you're wondering where all these moons could possibly fit, the answer is actually pretty simple: most of them are pretty much just wobbly little rocks. All 128 of the newly discovered moons are so-called irregular moons, meaning they're fragments of larger objects that got pulled into Saturn's orbit long ago. Each one is just a few kilometers across. The researchers say that many of these moons could stem from a relatively recent collision—just about a hundred million years ago.

We'll end things on a delightful note with a new study on the incredible power of whale urine. A paper published last Monday in Nature Communications reports on the “great whale conveyor belt,” which transports what researchers estimate is nearly 4,000 tons of nitrogen around the world each year. Nitrogen is crucial for supporting the ocean's food chain because it provides fuel for phytoplankton. Without whale pee, it turns out, some marine climates might really be hurting for the stuff.

Many whales spend the summer living in the nutrient-rich waters of cooler climates before traveling thousands of miles to warmer breeding grounds, where they live in higher concentrations. When they shed biomass in the form of poop, placentas and carcasses, they leave some of the nutrients of their summer binge in the waters of their winter homes. But according to this new study, it's the pee they leave behind that funnels the most nitrogen into their breeding grounds and they leave behind a lot of pee. One study found that a fin whale can produce 250 gallons of urine in a day..

The researchers estimate that whales might have transferred three times as many nutrients before commercial whaling lowered their populations. But even with that huge slowdown in the great whale conveyor belt, the animals are still super impactful: in one sanctuary in Hawaii, for example, whales provide approximately double the amount of nutrients that come from natural processes like ocean currents. Their liquid gold—and other bodily releases—helps support thriving ecosystems in coastal spots all over the world.

A dramatic solar eclipse on March 29 will be the first one visible in North America since April 2024. Here's how to get the best view of the partial eclipse before it ends.

On Saturday, March 29, two weeks after a total lunar eclipse was visible to all of North America, skywatchers will be treated to a spectacular event that has not been seen from anywhere since last October: a solar eclipse.

During this eclipse, which is expected to be one of the best skywatching events in 2025, observers in eastern Canada and the northeastern U.S. will be able to witness a partially eclipsed sunrise. It will be the first solar eclipse in North America since the ""Great American Eclipse"" on April 8, 2024.

This event will be a deep partial solar eclipse; about 93% of the sun's disk will be blocked by the new moon. As such, it will be a near — but not quite — total solar eclipse. The event will be visible at sunrise and shortly after from parts of North America, and then from Greenland, Iceland, Europe and northwest Africa, where it will be a smaller eclipse as the sun climbs higher in the sky throughout the morning. People in northwestern Russia can watch the eclipse late in the day, with a partially eclipsed sunset occurring over remote areas of Siberia.

The partial solar eclipse will take place for about two hours across the planet, between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. ET (8:50 UTC and 12:43 UTC). The best places to view the eclipse will be northern Quebec, where a maximum of 93.1% of the sun will be obscured by the moon. The closer any location is to Akulivik in northern Quebec, the deeper the eclipse will be there. However, this region also sees the eclipse at sunrise.

Choice locations for viewing the spectacle include northeast of Quebec City and along the border between Maine and New Brunswick.

From the eastern contiguous U.S., the sun will be eclipsed to a maximum of 85%, according to In The Sky. However, that will only occur in northern Maine; most population centers on the East Coast will miss out on the most dramatic spectacle. For instance, Philadelphia will see only 11% coverage, while Washington, D.C., will experience just 1%. An eclipsed sunrise will be visible from the U.S. East Coast, from the Canadian border down to Virginia Beach, Virginia.

Reykjavik, Iceland, will see 67% of the sun blocked by the moon, with less coverage in Dublin (41%), London (30%), Paris (23%) and Berlin (15%).

Because there will be no totality, all observers of this partial solar eclipse will need proper eye protection at all times — including eclipse glasses and solar filters for all cameras and binoculars.

Repeat: It is NEVER safe to look at a partial solar eclipse without eye protection, even during 93% coverage of the sun. Please observe safely.

After spending more than nine months in space, astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finally coming home. NASA is targeting a Tuesday evening (March 18) splashdown for the returning astronauts, if weather conditions remain favorable.

A pair of NASA astronauts stuck aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for more than nine months will return to Earth on Tuesday (March 18) at the earliest, NASA has said.

Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will depart the space station aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule on Tuesday morning and splash down near Florida by the evening, if the weather permits.

Wilmore and Williams arrived at the ISS in June as part of Boeing's first Starliner Crew Test Flight. But a number of issues with Boeing's spacecraft — including five helium leaks and five failures of its reaction control system (RCS) thrusters — led to the mission being abandoned and the duo's time in space extended from eight days to nearly 300.

Their return, part of NASA's scheduled rotation between the ISS's Crew-9 and Crew-10 missions, was originally scheduled for Wednesday (March 19), but has been bumped forward to 5:57 pm ET on Tuesday (March 18) due to favorable weather conditions, according to NASA.

""The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favorable weather conditions expected for later in the week,"" NASA wrote in an announcement on Sunday (March 16).

If everything goes according to plan, Wilmore and Williams will ride home on the Crew-9 Dragon capsule, called ""Freedom"", alongside fellow NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov — half of the usual Crew-9 crew to allow space for the Starliner duo.

The Starliner astronauts' 300 consecutive days in space is nowhere near the current record of 437 days set by Russian Cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov in 1995, but it's still a long, and completely unexpected extension of the astronauts' shift aboard the ISS.

And it's also one that can have deleterious effects on the human body, causing the heart, bones and muscles to shrink over time under low gravity. These are well known side effects of long-term spaceflight that all astronauts must face, and not related to the extension of Wilmore and Williams' mission. To mitigate them, the astronauts have been doing two hours of resistance and endurance training every day.

""Mission managers will continue monitoring weather conditions in the area, as Dragon's undocking depends on various factors, including spacecraft readiness, recovery team readiness, weather, sea states, and other factors,"" NASA wrote in its update. ""NASA and SpaceX will confirm the specific splashdown location closer to the Crew-9 return.""

For those who want to watch Wilmore and Williams on their return, NASA will stream the event beginning on Monday (March 17) at 10:45 p.m. ET as the hatches close between Freedom and the ISS. The stream will then resume two hours later for undocking, which is expected at 1:05 a.m. ET. Live coverage will resume in the evening when the astronauts begin to reenter Earth's atmosphere, currently scheduled for 5:11 p.m. ET.

This small, carved dog epitomizes ancient Egyptians' love of pets.

Name: Mechanical Dog

What it is: A moving dog sculpture carved from ivory

Where it is from: Egypt

When it was made: Around 1390 to 1352 B.C.

What it tells us about the past:

Posed as if leaping through the air, this carved ivory dog opens its mouth as a lever is pushed up and down, revealing two lower teeth and a red tongue. The dog, which was discovered in an ancient Egyptian tomb, is a reminder that these domesticated canines have been beloved pets for at least 3,400 years.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The small dog sculpture, now at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, is made from elephant ivory. It is 7.2 inches (18.2 centimeters) long from nose to toes and shows the very good boy in a flying gallop, legs extended in the air. According to The Met, the lever that works the dog's lower jaw, making it appear to bark, was originally held on by a piece of leather cord looped through small holes. At some point, the cord was replaced with a metal dowel secured in the dog's shoulder.

The Met obtained the dog sculpture from the personal collection of Howard Carter, the Egyptologist who famously discovered King Tut's tomb in the Valley of the Kings in 1922. It is unclear exactly where the dog was found, but The Met suggests it may have been placed in an elite tomb sometime during the reign of Amenhotep III, King Tut's grandfather, in the 14th century B.C. But its purpose is unclear; it may have been a toy or a magical ceremonial object.

Ancient Egyptians were quite fond of their dogs. While some were used for hunting, shepherding or as watchdogs, many were pets. This sculpture definitely represents a domesticated dog because the incised lines around its neck form a collar, Met curator emerita Catharine Roehrig wrote in a publication of the artifact.

During Egypt's New Kingdom (1550 to 1070 B.C.), dog collars became increasingly ornate, often inscribed with the dog's name, such as those found in the Tomb of Maiherpri. This dog sculpture does not have a name attached to its collar, but The Met notes that some common Egyptian dog names translate to Blackie, Son of the Moon and Good-for-Nothing.

The breed of this sculpted dog is also unclear. Ancient Egyptians tended to prefer energetic dog breeds, and the ones often represented in their art include the ancestors of the hunting dog basenji, the Ibizan hound and the pharaoh hound.

Dogs were also linked with the god Anubis and with the afterlife in Egyptian mythology; they were sometimes seen as a kind of intermediary between the worlds of the living and the dead. Killing a dog — particularly a collared one — was a severe crime, and a family would have mourned the death of their dog as they would a human relative: by shaving their eyebrows. However, Egyptians believed that they would meet their dogs again in the afterlife, which is likely the reason they mummified them and buried them in special pet cemeteries.

What's the oldest lake on Earth?

The oldest lake in the world dates back about 25 million years and is also the world's deepest and most biologically diverse lake.

Just like the mountains, lakes on Earth can be ancient, or more than 1 million years old. There are only 20 ancient lakes on the planet, but which is the oldest?

Earth's oldest lake has a clear winner: Lake Baikal in southeast Siberia. Scientists estimate that this enormous freshwater body is 25 million years old, according to Ted Ozersky, an associate professor of biological limnology (the study of inland bodies of water) at the University of Minnesota. By contrast, the Great Lakes formed less than 20,000 years ago. The second oldest lake on Earth is Lake Issyk-Kul in Kyrgyzstan, which formed about 20 million years ago.

Lake Baikal measures 12,239 square miles (31,700 square kilometers), making it Earth's seventh-largest lake. It is not only the world's oldest lake but also the deepest one, at about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers). But that's just the water depth. ""The actual basin is much more than a mile deep,"" Ozersky told Live Science, including between 3.1 and 4.3 miles (5 to 7 km) of sediment at the bottom. In the case of Lake Baikal, where there are miles of sediment, researchers use seismic surveys to estimate the average rate of sediment formation, Ozersky said.

This sediment is key to dating the lake. Researchers measure a lake's age through isotopic dating. This technique involves measuring the ratios of radioactive isotopes. In this case, limnologists analyze lake sediments for radioactive versions of cesium, lead and carbon. This analysis tells them how old the different layers of sediment are and how fast that sediment accumulates, Ozersky explained

By understanding lake formation — and Lake Baikal's formation, in particular — researchers can get a better idea of how it has persisted for millions of years. Many lakes form as glacial features, Mark Edlund, a senior scientist and the director of aquatic research and collections at the Science Museum of Minnesota, told Live Science. Glaciers score a pocket in the landscape and deposit chunks of ice that eventually melt and fill the depression. ""But in the grand scheme, they're very short-lived systems,"" Edlund said.

On the other hand, Lake Baikal is a rift lake. Rift lakes form when two continental plates start moving away from each other, creating a chasm. This chasm is called a graben. As these plates continue to drift apart, the graben continues to deepen. ""As a result, that site never fills in,"" Edlund said, which is why rift lakes can last so long.

In fact, Ozersky said Lake Baikal gets an inch (2.5 centimeters) wider every year. Some of the world's other oldest lakes, like Lake Malawi (up to 5 million years old) and Lake Tanganyika (up to 12 million years old) — both in Southeast Africa — also come from rifts.

Lake Baikal also claims the title of Earth's most biologically diverse lake, according to Ozersky.



""Evolution has had so much time to work in that system without being interrupted,"" he said. It also has the highest rate of flora and fauna endemic to its ecosystem, meaning those plants and animals aren't found anywhere else on Earth. Perhaps the best and most beloved example is the Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica), the only freshwater seal species. (Although other seal species may inhabit lakes, those seals have ""invaded"" them through streams, Ozersky noted.)

This ancient lake also hosts hundreds of species of freshwater shrimp, which gives researchers the opportunity to study speciation and diversification. ""Trying to understand how evolution works is one thing that is really interesting about Baikal,"" Ozersky said.

—Do the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean mix?

—How much water is in Earth's atmosphere?

Edlund also studies diatoms, which are a unicellular type of algae. These organisms pull dissolved silica from the water and turn it into biologically produced glass, which encases them. Diatoms are typically between 10 and 50 microns (about half the width of a human hair) in diameter, but Baikal's diatoms are unusually large at about 50 to 150 microns. ""When we look at the diatoms in Lake Baikal, they just blow your mind,"" Edlund said.

The lake is also open to human visitors. But because it's covered with ice five months out of the year, it's not a great swimming destination. Its average surface temperature is 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius). ""It's a bitterly cold lake,"" Edlund said. ""If you want to swim in it, you've got to gird your loins.""

Scientists at OpenAI have attempted to stop a frontier AI model from cheating and lying by punishing it. But this just taught it to scheme more privately.

Punishing artificial intelligence for deceptive or harmful actions doesn't stop it from misbehaving; it just makes it hide its deviousness, a new study by ChatGPT creator OpenAI has revealed.

Since arriving in public in late 2022, artificial intelligence (AI) large language models (LLMs) have repeatedly revealed their deceptive and outright sinister capabilities. These include actions ranging from run-of-the-mill lying, cheating and hiding their own manipulative behavior to threatening to kill a philosophy professor, steal nuclear codes and engineer a deadly pandemic.

Now, a new experiment has shown that weeding out this bad behavior during the training process may be even tougher than first thought.

Researchers at OpenAI tasked an unreleased model with goals that could be completed by cheating, lying or taking shortcuts. The team found the AI engaged in ""reward hacking"" — maximizing its rewards by cheating.

Yet punishing the model didn't make it fix its behavior, it only made it more deceptive. The company outlined its research in a blog post, so it has not yet been peer-reviewed.

""It's common for frontier reasoning models to very clearly state their intent within their chain-of-thought [CoT]. For example, they are often so forthright about their plan to subvert a task they think ""Let's hack,"" the researchers wrote in the blog post.

While developers can monitor and flag misbehavior, the models' ""natural monitorability is very fragile,"" they added. ""If strong supervision is directly applied to the chain-of-thought, models can learn to hide their intent while continuing to misbehave.""

Reasoning models, such as ChatGPT's o1 and o3-mini, are an upgraded version of standard LLMs that use a method called ""chain-of-thought"" to backtrack and reevaluate their logic, which enables them to tackle more complex tasks with greater accuracy. During the chain-of-thought process, models spell out their logic in plain language with every step they take, thus enabling their actions to be easily observed.

By using a standard LLM, GPT-4o, to oversee an unreleased frontier reasoning model during training, the researchers watched as the model completed a number of coding tasks.

But in some of these cases, the reasoning model found it easier and more desirable to reward hack, explicitly stating it was doing so in its chain-of-thought. In one instance, it bypassed its assigned task by terminating programs prematurely and reporting success. In another, it mimicked the expected files to be output by a task in name alone, leaving them empty and nonfunctional.

—AI could crack unsolvable problems — and humans won't be able to understand the results

—AI can now replicate itself — a milestone that has experts terrified

When the researchers attempted to penalize the system, it did somewhat improve its results. Yet significant instances of reward hacking and faulty outputs remained; the reasoning model simply found ways to hide the cheating in its chain of thought from the monitoring AI.

""The agent trained with CoT pressure still learns to reward hack; only now its cheating is undetectable by the monitor because it has learned to hide its intent in the chain-of-thought,"" the researchers wrote.

Because it's hard to tell if a chain of thought has been tampered with, the researchers recommend that others working with reasoning models avoid applying strong supervision to chain-of-thought processes. This advice is even more crucial if AI, in its current form or another, can ever match or exceed the intelligence of the humans monitoring it.

""Sacrificing an effective method for monitoring reasoning models may not be worth the small improvement to capabilities, and we therefore recommend to avoid such strong CoT optimization pressures until they are better understood,"" the researchers wrote.

A death adder at an Australian wildlife park found to have three extremely rare fangs that all produce deadly neurotoxic venom.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In a first-of-its-kind discovery, a death adder has been found with three super-sharp, venomous fangs, instead of the usual two.

""This is something we've never seen before,"" Billy Collett, park manager at the Australian Reptile Park, where the snake lives, said in a statement emailed to Live Science. ""We've had this death adder in the venom program for about seven years, but only recently did we notice the third fang. I thought it would just shed off over time, but one year later, and it's still there!""

This third fang, located right next to one of the other fangs at the left side of the snake's mouth, also produces venom. This means it has a much larger venom output per bite than is usual for a death adder, making it even more deadly.



This ultra-rare snake ""might actually be the most dangerous death adder in the world,"" Collett said in a video interview. According to the statement, the extra fang is the result of a never-before-seen mutation.

Death adders (Acanthophis) are a group of venomous snakes native to Australia and New Guinea. They have one of the fastest strikes of any snake, with some species being capable of biting and injecting venom from their fangs in under 0.15 seconds. Their venom contains neurotoxins that can cause paralysis and even death if left untreated. Before the development of antivenom, around 50% of death adder bites were fatal.

This snake is part of Australian Reptile Park's antivenom production program, and its extremely rare extra fang was discovered when it was being milked for its venom. This involves gently squeezing a snake's venom glands while it bites onto a collection container, causing the venom to pour into the vial.

This three-fanged death adder was found to produce far more venom than usual, with ""massive yields"" coming out of all three fangs. It produces roughly double that of a two-fanged death adder — although it's unclear whether the higher yield is the result of the extra fang, or that this individual just produces high quantities of venom.

This is the first three-fanged snake ever discovered at the Australian Reptile Park, which has been operating for 20 years and has milked hundreds of thousands of snakes, a spokesperson for the park told Live Science in an email.

""There have been other 3 fanged snakes found in Australia, but from what we can find, there have been no 3 fanged death adders recorded,"" they said.

Exactly why this snake has three fangs instead of two is unclear, but may be related to the process of fang replacement. Similar to human adult teeth, death adders have replacement fangs growing behind the active ones, so when a fang is lost, a new one moves forward to take its place. This ensures that their fangs remain sharp and functional for injecting venom.

""It's normal for death adders to shed fangs over time and replace them with new ones every few months or so,"" the spokesperson said. ""Unfortunately, we don't actually know what has caused the 3rd fang to develop and don't currently have the facilities to run any tests.""

Standing in front of a wooden dais with a teal blue sign attached to the front with the acronym ""NCAA"" -- in this case standing for ""National Corrupt Athletic Association"" -- West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey and Attorney General JB McCuskey announced at a joint press conference Monday they will launch an investigation into the NCAA Tournament selection committee after the Mountaineers were snubbed from the 68-team field on Sunday.

""Nearly every single sports fan, pundit and Bracketologist had WVU as a shoo-in for the tournament,"" Gov. Morrisey said, less than a day after the Mountaineers were the first team left out of the field. ""This was a miscarriage of justice and robbery at the highest levels.""

Gov. Morrisey took particular issue with West Virginia's omission combined with North Carolina's inclusion and cited the potential conflict of interest in the decision-making with UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham serving as selection committee chair. He went on to discuss the merits of their respective resumes, discussing performance in various quadrants and strength of schedule.

""Now, who was the last team to get into the tournament ahead of the Mountaineers?"" Gov. Morrisey asked hypothetically. ""That would be the University of North Carolina. Now, let's see how their resume stacks up. The Tar Heels went 1-12 in Quad one games and even had a Quad 3 loss. And we keep hearing about the importance of these Quad 1 wins, but UNC couldn't even get more than one.

""They also had the 25th toughest schedule in America right behind WVU,"" he continued. ""Now, here's something you may not know: UNC had representation in the room during the selection process. Let me repeat that. UNC had representation in the room during the selection process. Bubba Cunningham is the athletic director for UNC. He also happens to be the head of the tournament selection committee.""

Gov. Morrisey then asked for JB McCuskey to launch an investigation into the selection committee to ""determine if any backroom deals, corruption, bribes or any nefarious activity"" took place during the selection process.

Pressed for details on the investigation, Gov. Morrisey said it's unclear if he plans to bring legal action to the fight and emphasized he first wants to see ""objective criteria"" for tournament inclusion.

West Virginia was the first team out of the 68-team field revealed on Selection Sunday, while North Carolina was the last team to make the field. 

UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham had to recuse himself for any conversations related to UNC's NCAA Tournament inclusion. But the puzzling decision to put UNC in over West Virginia warranted further inspection Sunday, and it did not withstand scrutiny.

In particular, the committee said the availability of Tucker DeVries -- who hadn't played since December for West Virginia -- was a factor discussed, as was UNC's T-Rank (a metric from Bart Torvik measuring efficiency) and standing in WAB (Wins Above Bubble).

""It is incumbent upon me to work with the governor to ensure that this process is fair,"" McCuskey said. ""We earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament. You can't really make an argument any other way.""

Winning big in both college football and men's basketball has never been more difficult, especially as NIL and upcoming revenue sure ensure a battle for resources. Unlike the player-led professional game, though, coaches are the mainstays who keep programs afloat and competing year after year. 

Having stability and talent at both coaching spots is a major luxury, one only emphasized with the departure of legends like Nick Saban and Mike Krzyzewski from the game. Since we debuted this list last season, the landscape has shifted dramatically. UConn basketball coach Dan Hurley won his second consecutive championship, making the Huskies a surefire factor. John Calipari left Kentucky and Jim Larrañaga retired at Miami, shaking up the case for both schools. 

Just beyond this list, there's a massive group of contenders waiting in the wings. The SEC's basketball resurgence means Florida and Georgia suddenly factor into the conversation. Outstanding young coaches, like those at BYU and Louisville, have great cases but need to replicate quick success. One year from now, the list could look very different. But heading into the 2025 NCAA Tournament, these are the top 10 college football/men's basketball coaching combinations in the country. 

2024 rank: 1

The Jayhawks narrowly hang onto the top spot, but the race is closer than ever. In the past year, Self has lost his stranglehold on the No. 1 coach spot and took a pair of preseason No. 1 teams to underwhelming seasons. Leipold also failed to build on a breakout nine-win season, though the Jayhawks finished the year strong. Still, Self is the most accomplished coach in the sport with more than 800 wins and two national titles. Leipold took the worst program in FBS and already made it so 5-7 was a disappointment, following up a dazzling run at Buffalo. We'll give KU a mulligan, but next year must go better. 

2024 rank: 3

Oats continues to elevate his stock as one of the best coaches in college basketball after leading the Crimson Tide to the first Final Four in program history. In six years, he has two SEC regular season titles, two SEC tournament titles and five straight NCAA Tournament appearances. DeBoer's first season at Alabama had ups and downs but still ended on the edge of the expanded College Football Playoff. Nominally, it was the worst season of his coaching career with a 9-4 record -- but that says more about his storied coaching career. This combo is on the way up. 

2024 rank: 9

Good coaches can put together a run; great ones can do it again. After leading Iowa State back to the Big 12 title game in 2024, Campbell officially belongs with the greats. Campbell led Iowa State to 11 wins for the first time in program history. Otzelberger has been a game-changer since taking over a 2-22 Iowa State squad in 2021. He has a pair of Sweet 16 runs with a Big 12 Tournament title sprinkled in. Most exciting -- the coaches are both under 50 and seem content in Ames. It's a golden era, Cyclones fans, don't take it for granted. 

2024 rank: 7

Heupel found success faster than anyone could have expected, posting 30 wins in his last three seasons with an appearance in the College Football Playoff. It's the most wins over a three-year period at Tennessee since 1998 when the Vols won a natty. Barnes just keeps chugging along in Knoxville, capturing a pair of SEC regular season titles and reaching an Elite Eight. The pair have brought unbelievable steadiness to Tennessee. 

2024 rank: NR

The Tigers were on the cusp of the list last year, but a strong showing by both coaches helped cement their spot in 2025. Two-time national champion Swinney found a second wind, capturing his ninth ACC championship and returning to the College Football Playoff. Even at his worst, Swinney is easily a top-five coach. Fourteen seasons into his tenure, Brownell suddenly elevated himself into the elite of the ACC. Clemson reached an Elite Eight last season and surprisingly elevated themselves to 18-2 in conference play in 2025. 

2024 rank: 6

The Ducks stayed steady as Lanning lived up to lofty expectations in Year 3. The Ducks earned the No. 1 overall seed in the first 12-team CFP and a Big Ten championship with an undefeated 13-0 record in the regular season. Lanning is perhaps the best coach in the country under the age of 45. The older Altman had a resurgence during his first year in the Big Ten, posting a 24-8 record. Altman has 15 straight 20-win seasons and has won a postseason game every year, including a Final Four in 2017. 

2024 rank: 5

It's difficult to perfectly rate Smith after a 5-7 record in his first year with the Spartans, but leading Oregon State to 25 wins over three years in the Pac-12 still counts for a lot. And as he transitions in, Izzo has been happy to take the mantle. Michigan State fielded its best basketball team since 2019 with a Big Ten title run. And even without 2024, his Hall of Fame resume is off the charts. Not many coaches are still thriving at 70, but Izzo is one of the greats. 

2024 rank: NR

Yes, two-time national champion Hurley paces this choice, but there's some darn good football being played in Storrs. Mora took over a flailing Huskies program and led them to a pair of bowl games, the best run since the collapse of the Big East. UConn went 9-4 and beat North Carolina in the Fenway Bowl. Hurley had a frustrating 2025 but still lords above the rest of college basketball after his consecutive titles, with another chance to go on a run. And, by the way, we don't even get to factor in legendary women's basketball coach Geno Auriemma's greatness. 

2024 rank: NR

If this was the 2022 season -- when Baylor won both the 2021 basketball title and 2022 Sugar Bowl -- this pair would have a case for No. 1. However, the last few years have leaned a little inconsistent. Drew is still considered one of the sport's elite coaches after winning a tourney game in five straight years, including the 2021 title. He rebuffed Kentucky last season and is set to produce his sixth first-round pick in five years. Aranda should rocket back up coaching lists after a resurgent 2024 season that ended on a six-game regular season winning streak. The Bears are poised to be one of the preseason Big 12 favorites. 

2024 rank: 8

Sampson, 69, only seems to be getting better. After transitioning Houston to the rough-and-tumble Big 12, the Cougars went a combined 34-4 with back-to-back conference championships. Houston has reached at least the Sweet 16 in five straight NCAA Tournaments, including Elite Eight and Final Four trips. Fritz takes a slight knock after a 4-8 transition year in his first campaign at the power conference level, but the Cougars are positioned well to take a step in his second season and vault back up the list. 

Fell off the list: Kentucky, North Carolina, Miami

Los Angeles Dodgers star Mookie Betts will miss both games of the upcoming Tokyo Series against the Chicago Cubs because of illness, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has announced. However, Betts is expected to recover in time to play in the Dodgers' stateside opener against the Detroit Tigers on March 27. 

While Roberts did not disclose the exact nature of Betts' illness, he did say it is not believed to be contagious and that Betts has lost ""close to 15 pounds"" as a result of it. The club is still considering sending Betts back home early so he can continue his recovery in more familiar surroundings.

Betts, 32, is coming off a typically strong 2024 campaign for the reigning-champion Dodgers. In 116 games, he slashed .289/.372/.491 with 19 home runs and 16 stolen bases. The future Hall of Famer also for the first time in his career served as a primary shortstop – a remarkable feat for an outfielder by training in his thirties. Betts is lined up to be the Dodgers' regular shortstop again in 2025. Veteran infielder Miguel Rojas figures to fill in at short during Betts' absence. 

Coming off a 98-win season and a World Series title, the Dodgers once again have title aspirations. This winter, they complemented an already star-laden roster by signing Blake Snell and Roki Sasaki, two of the most coveted pitchers on the free-agent market. As well, they also re-signed veteran slugger Teoscar Hernández and added a pair of high-leverage arms to the bullpen in Kirby Yates and Tanner Scott.

The Tokyo Series, MLB's lone international regular-season games this year, kicks off on Tuesday at 6 a.m. ET with Yoshinobu Yamamoto taking the mound for the Dodgers and Shota Imanaga for the Cubs.

Well, gang, we've almost made it. The Major League Baseball season officially kicks off Tuesday in our wee hours with the Dodgers and Cubs squaring off in Japan, but the official Opening Day is Thursday, March 27. That means come next Monday, we'll be back to the Official Power Rankings of 30 teams from me that you've grown to know and love, greatly, over the course of the past 13 seasons.

We started the spring with a full Power Ranking before tiding ourselves over during spring training with lists of top lineups, top rotations, top bullpens, top offensive duos and now our final installment: top ballparks. 

I've done ballpark rankings before and have generally always taken a lot of things into account, such as the parking/transportation situation, the exterior, the area surrounding the ballpark, etc. 

This time around, it's going to be just how the ballpark looks from the inside or on TV. Specifically, picture yourself walking into the ballpark from behind the backstop and viewing everything from home plate to out over the outfield wall. 

What are the best ballpark views in baseball? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, obviously, which means mileage may vary. For me, I grew up seeing plenty of the cookie-cutter, two-sport venues and those were a relative eye sore. Gimme some personality and quirkiness and/or a gorgeous view. 

Is this bias? Of course there is. There is for everyone. If you grew up going to a ballpark and the team playing there is still your favorite team, there's no doubt there's an inherent bias. I embrace mine and regular readers can already guess what sits at No. 1. Make your own rankings if you have an issue. I'm not acting like the ultimate authority here.

Some parks that ranked highly in the past missed the cut here, such as Comerica Park (Tigers) and I love Yankee Stadium because it's Yankee Stadium, but walking in, it isn't overly breathtaking compared to the rest. Make sure to latch onto that last part. Every MLB ballpark should be beautiful, so it's all relative. I'm going to pick a top 10 here, but I generally like them all.  

Honorable mention: Petco Park (Padres), T-Mobile Park (Mariners), Target Field (Twins), Great American Ball Park (Reds)

There will be a few people who lament the removal of Tal's Hill and the in-play flagpole in center field, but I still really enjoy the look over left field with the Crawford Boxes and the train over the top of the station facade. That brick out there in left-center field in play is pretty nice-looking as well. I like the quirks. The replacement for Tal's Hill is a batter's eye that contains an Astros logo in it and I quite enjoy that as well. I'm a fan of this polarizing yard. 

Once the Rams departed and this ballpark got a nice facelift to return to a one-sport venue -- as God intended -- the team did such a great job with it. The tall right-field wall, the shrubbery and grass in center and the waterfall rock pile (""California Spectacular"")  in left-center make this one of the best views in the majors. 

Without duplicating the most iconic one, I appreciate when ballparks use a high outfield wall in just a small segment, just as the Rockies do with a portion of right field. Moving from the right-field foul pole toward center, you get a view of the bullpen surrounded by trees before you get to center with a collection of rocks, trees, shrubs and water features. It's beautiful. Above the batters eye, deep in center is the ""Rockpile,"" a section for fans to buy cheap tickets with a nice, if a bit distant, view of home plate from the outfield. And in left, there's the monster videoboard with a large Rockies logo atop. If anything, this ballpark is ranked too low. It's excellent. 

In terms of the legacy of this stadium, it would be ranked higher. It was the one that changed everything and directed things toward the retro-modern movement that produced so many great ballparks. The best thing it did was shift away from the cookie-cutters. Regardless, that doesn't count here because I'm only judging how the ballpark looks from the inside and this one still scores terrifically. Again with the high wall in right field and it's an especially nice view with the warehouse looming over the top. That alone is what makes this ballpark unique and worth a look. 

I'm not going to get into measurements or anything because, again, this is an eye test list. What I am going to say is that from the Kauffman Stadium seats behind home plate, that gigantic videoboard with the Royals crown on top certainly looks like the most monstrous in all of baseball. It's probably due to the relatively small grandstands surrounding it, but it sticks out nicely and I'm a fan. Of course, the main event here is the waterworks over the outfield wall. It just never gets old seeing home run balls splash out there. Bonus points for the view over the ballpark being trees (at least when they are green) because I'll always prefer that over buildings. 

My only explanation for this ballpark being ranked so low -- yes, five is low for this one -- is that it's an absurdly crowded top five.  Hiking up to the top of the hill to enter on the home plate side in the top deck of the stadium, looking out over the mountains behind the outfield wall provides arguably the most gorgeous backdrop in baseball. You'll spot some palm trees as well and almost always a clear, blue sky. From any which way you view that ballpark, it is toward the top in all of baseball. Also, those jagged, metal ""covers"" over the top of the outfield seats provide some character. 

It's a pretty breathtaking view of the Pittsburgh skyline over the Allegheny River. I love that, as long as you sit high enough, you can see the river along with the yellow bridge looking over center field and right-center. Again we have an extra-large right-field wall and this one is special because it stands exactly 21 feet high in honor of No 21. Roberto Clemente. That yellow bridge I just mentioned is the Roberto Clemente Bridge, too. The shrubbery spelling out Pirates in the batter's eye is cool and there are quirks on the left-field wall as well. The designers of the ballpark didn't just hit a home run, it was a grand slam. 

Pretty easy to envision, no? The Green Monster is legendary for every baseball fan and I still remember tearing up the first time I finally got to see it in person. The triangle in center field is an excellent quirk as well, just as the bullpens right over the way-too-small right-field wall leading over to the fans being on top of the action and Pesky's Pole. Though there are a lot of seats, the feeling is still quite cozy when you glance out over the ballpark, almost in an inviting way. 

Much like above, I significantly enjoy the water over the right field wall being such a part of the ballpark viewing experience. In the case of San Francisco, it's McCovey Cove and we get to see some home runs splash down, though not nearly as frequently since the retirement of Barry Bonds. 

Here, though, if you get high enough and position yourself correctly a little bit on the first-base side, you can get a view of water all around the outfield in addition to seeing the Bay Bridge. It's quite a view. That isn't all, of course. Over on the left-field side you'll see the huge Coke bottle (that actually has kids' slides inside) and large baseball glove. The large center-field videoboard featuring a clock on top fits really well. And of course, there's right field. There are weird juts all over the place, making it near impossible for any right-fielder to properly play balls hit off the wall. The brick in right field provides a nice view before you look over the top to the water. I can't say enough about how much I love this place. 

The ivy-covered walls still do it for me and were a childhood favorite as a Cubs fan. The old scoreboard up, deep over the center field wall is another fixture and I like the batter's eye, too. The much-maligned videoboards do nothing to detract from the view, for me, and you can still catch a glimpse of the rooftops seats from inside the yard. I love the curves on the outfield wall in right and left field that pave the way for some of the longest dimensions down the line in baseball moving toward a short power alley. 

Bias here, yeah, obviously, but if you're talking about just looking over Wrigley from somewhere behind home plate in the middle of a sunny, summer day for a 1:20 p.m. Chicago time start, you simply can't match it for me.

The Cincinnati Bengals may be able to have their cake and eat it, too. Less than 24 hours after word came down the franchise  is inking historic extensions with receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, it now appears Cincinnati may also be keeping another familiar face in town. The Bengals are working to retain star pass rusher Trey Hendrickson, and those talks between the two sides are ongoing, according to The Athletic.

If the Bengals do end up finding a way to keep Hendrickson aboard, it would be an almost unfathomable development. Throughout the offseason, it appeared as if he might be the casualty of the team prioritizing extensions for Chase and Higgins, and they even permitted Hendrickson, who has one year remaining on his contract and is looking for an extension himself, to seek a trade. The Bengals were reportedly asking for a first-round pick plus additional assets for Hendrickson. 

So far, no deal has come across the wire, and with the dust now settled on Chase and Higgins extensions, the team can now turn its attention toward potentially keeping Hendrickson for the foreseeable future. Similar to Chase and Higgins, however, it'll likely cost a pretty penny. 

Hendrickson, 30, is coming off a tremendous season where he led the NFL with 17.5 sacks. That sack total matches his production from the 2023 season, which broke a franchise record that he previously set in 2021 with 14 sacks. Along with the sacks, Hendrickson also notched 46 tackles, 36 quarterback hits and two forced fumbles in 2024, which helped him earn first-team All-Pro honors for the first time in his career. He was also named to the Pro Bowl for the fourth consecutive year. 

Hendrickson initially entered the league as a third-round draft choice of the New Orleans Saints in 2017 out of Florida Atlantic. He spent the first four years of his career with the Saints before signing a four-year, $60 million contract with the Bengals in March of 2021 and has been with the club ever since.

The NCAA Tournament Selection Committee unveiled its 2025 bracket on Sunday, and there was one shocking moment that stood out above all the rest: North Carolina's name was called as one of the last four teams in the 68-team field

Usually, the last several teams in and out of the bracket are of similar quality but in different ways. Take Xavier, Texas, West Virginia and Indiana, for example. All had some strengths and all had some notable deficits. North Carolina, however, was almost all deficits.

As it has been noted ad nauseam in the moments since the reveal, I'm sure, North Carolina was 1-12 in Quad 1 games this season -- the win being a neutral-court victory over UCLA, a 7 seed in this bracket. Seven of the Tar Heels' Quad 1 losses were to teams seeded 1 or 2. Three of those, of course, came to arch-rival Duke.  

It's bracket time! Play for a Nissan Armada and Final Four® trips by joining our Men's and Women's Challenges.

But they also had two losses to non-tournament teams along with a Quad 3 loss to Stanford.

As for their other 21 wins -- the only other one over an NCAA Tournament team was over Patriot League champion American.

I've been doing NCAA Tournament bracket projections for a very long time. There has never been an at-large candidate that had so thoroughly proven it was not an NCAA Tournament quality team yet still gets into the field. 

Some speculation has been making the rounds that North Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham, who also serves as selection committee chair, had a role in making sure his team received a bid. Decisions like this invite such speculation, but the committee has very strict rules about members not being allowed to discuss or vote on their own team or teams in their conference.

That rule is strictly enforced, so it's highly unlikely Cunningham swayed any decision-making in this case.

There was some mention of the metrics on the team sheets working in North Carolina's favor some. That is especially true of the predictive metrics, which primarily try to predict scoring margins. In order to do so, scoring margin heavily influences those systems.

The problem with that, however, is that the committee always tells us that this is a results-oriented process and scoring margin isn't a factor. But you can't rely on predictive metrics to help make decisions and still say that scoring margin isn't a factor. The fact that the NET -- a predictive metric -- is used to put teams in quadrants makes this process at least a little scoring margin based.

Also, there are teams in the bracket seeded nowhere near their predicative metric rankings. Gonzaga is top 10 in the NET and an 8 seed. Memphis is in the mid-40s in predicative metrics, and the Tigers are a 5 seed. So, obviously, they don't always carry the day.

Every once in a while, we get a team that pretty clearly does not belong in the bracket, like North Carolina this season, and it seems that those teams always win a game or two. Tournament success can't be used to judge the committee on selections because tournament results are not available to use as criteria. The vagaries of single-elimination tournaments mean that sometimes lesser-quality teams win games.

Will North Carolina go on a similar run of wins? Time will tell. But one thing for certain is that the Tar Heels' resume does little to convince anyone they deserved to be invited to the party on Selection Sunday. 

While North Carolina was a stunning inclusion, one of the most notable omissions from this field as the Tar Heels accepted their invitation was Indiana -- the committee's first team out. The Hoosiers had a bit of a late run to try to get into the field, winning four of their last six, but it just wasn't enough. 

Last month, it was announced that coach Mike Woodson would be stepping down at the end of the season after four seasons at the helm of his alma mater. Woodson led the Hoosiers to the NCAA Tournament in his first two seasons, but Sunday's snub marks the second straight season Indiana will not go dancing -- and it also marks the end of the Mike Woodson era in Bloomington.

Wasn't that long ago Maxx Crosby reset the market for players who aren't quarterbacks. Since Crosby signed an extension earlier this month that put him at a $35.5 million average annual salary, two players have since surpassed that mark over the next two weeks.

Of course, both of those record-setting extensions fell on a Sunday. Myles Garrett previously owned that title as the Cleveland Browns gave him a $40 million extension with a historic $122.8 million guaranteed. Just a week later, Ja'Marr Chase reset the market as the Cincinnati Bengals gave him a four-year, $161 million deal that pays him an average of $40.25 million a season. 

With Chase joining Garrett in the $40 million non-quarterback club, Chase's deal will certainly impact other non-quarterbacks whose agents are popping bottles while negotiating extensions for their superstar clients. Micah Parsons, Aidan Hutchinson and Trey Hendrickson are awaiting new contracts and stand to benefit the most from Garrett and Chase's new deals. 

This list will certainly change over the course of the offseason, but here are the 10 highest-paid non-quarterbacks in the NFL at this very moment.

Maxx Crosby

Las Vegas Raiders

$35,500,000

Justin Jefferson

Minnesota Vikings

$35,000,000

CeeDee Lamb

Dallas Cowboys

$34,000,000

Nick Bosa

San Francisco 49ers

$34,000,000

A.J. Brown

Philadelphia Eagles

$32,000,000

Amon-Ra St. Brown

Detroit Lions

$30,002,500

Tyreek Hill

Miami Dolphins

$30,000,000

Brandon Aiyuk

San Francisco 49ers

$30,000,000

Wide receivers still dominate the highest-paid non-quarterbacks list based on average per year salary, as eight of them are in the top-12 with Hill, Metcalf and Aiyuk tied for 10th. Pass rushers take up three positions on the list with Garrett, Crosby and Bosa as the three edge rushers who make $30+ million a year. Jones is the outlier as an interior defensive lineman, the only one to make $30+ million a year.

Now, let's take a look at the highest-paid, non-QBs in terms of guaranteed salary, a list that many would argue is even more important than a contract's average per year salary because APY can sometimes be artificially inflated by backloading a deal with money teams intended to never actually pay out. All the money below is cash each respective player will see.

Maxx Crosby

Las Vegas Raiders

$91,500,000

Chase became the highest-paid wide receiver in NFL history in guaranteed money, getting $112 million from the Bengals in his massive extension. He broke Jefferson's mark set last offseason, but remains in third among non-quarterbacks behind Garrett and Bosa. 

Players who line up in the trenches along the line of scrimmage dominate the guaranteed money top 10 list for non-QBs. Six pass rushers, five of whom are edge rushers (Garrett, Bosa, Crosby, Hines-Allen and Burns) and one interior defensive lineman (Jones), lead the way.

These two charts hammer home why Garrett's deal set sthe barometer for Watt, Parsons, Hendrickson, and other pass rushers seeking extensions. All these contracts were signed over the last two years, with Bosa setting the standard with his five-year, $170 million extension with $122.5 million guaranteed in 2023. These numbers will certainly go up with the rising salary cap and the ballooning wide receiver market.

Garrett's extension is the dynamite that ushers in a wave of record-setting spending this offseason, with Chase surpassing his average annual salary just a week later.

Joe Burrow has repeatedly stressed the importance of the Bengals re-signing both Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. The Bengals' quarterback has gotten his wish as the team has come to terms with both star wide receivers, with Chase landing a record-setting contract. 

Chase has agreed to a four-year, $161 million deal that includes $112 million guaranteed, according to multiple reports. Chase essentially confirmed the news when he quoted a report with a handshake emoji on social media. Higgins posted the same emoji on social media shortly after the deals were reported. 

Meanwhile, the Bengals' official X accounted posted an image of the two pass catchers, seemingly confirming the news.

The deal makes Chase the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. That distinction was held shortly by Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett, who recently signed a four-year, $160 million extension. 

Higgins has agreed to a four year, $115 million deal (including the first two years fully guaranteed), after playing the 2024 season under the franchise tag. The Bengals recently applied the franchise tag on him again with the intent of working toward a long-term deal. 

Teammates since 2021, Chase and Higgins have become arguably the NFL's top receiving duo over that span. 

A 2021 first-round pick, Chase is coming off a 2024 season that saw him become the fifth player since the league merger to lead the NFL in receptions, receiving yards and touchdown receptions. Chase's 46 touchdown catches since 2021 are the most in the NFL over that span. 

A 2020 second-round pick, Higgins has two 1,000-yard receiving seasons under his belt. Higgins was integral to the Bengals' 2021 Super Bowl run; he caught 18 passes for 309 yards during that year's postseason, which included four catches for 100 yards in Cincinnati's Super Bowl loss to the Rams. 

Along with Chase and Higgins, the Bengals also recently granted one of Burrow's other wishes by re-signing tight end Mike Gesicki to a three-year, $25.5 million deal. These signings are reinforcement that the Bengals are committed toward maximizing Burrow's prime years following two non-playoff seasons. 

The re-signings of Chase and Higgins makes the Bengals a legitimate threat to compete for AFC supremacy in 2025, assuming their defense bounces back after being historically bad during Cincinnati's 4-8 start in 2024. 

Speaking of defense, the Bengals are currently trying to figure out what to do with pass rusher Trey Hendrickson, who was recently granted permission to seek a trade partner. The NFL's leader with 17.5 sacks last season, Hendrickson wants to remain in Cincinnati, but he is also looking for a significant pay raise. It'll be interesting to see if the Bengals can work similar magic with Hendrickson as they did for Chase and Higgins. According to NFL Media, the sides have been in contact recently.

The Cincinnati Bengals are one of only two teams in the NFL that don't have a general manager, but it seems like they might have one now: Joe Burrow. 

Sure, he's actually the quarterback, but he might as well be the Bengals' general manager because he was the catalyst for Cincinnati's two biggest moves of the 2025 offseason and those were the new deals for Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins that came on Sunday night. 

Chase is getting a four-year, $161 million extension, which makes him the highest paid non-quarterback in the NFL at $40.25 million per year. As for Higgins, he landed a four-year, $115 million deal that makes him highest paid No. 2 receiver in the NFL at $28.75 million per year. 

The deals were shocking, but that's mostly because this isn't something the Bengals usually do. You'd have better luck trying to steal raw meat out of the mouth of an actual Bengal tiger than getting an extra dollar out of this Bengals' front office in a negotiation. The Bengals love to play hardball in negotiations and it's worked for them plenty of times, but this time, they gave Higgins and Chase the keys to the vault. 

Fair or not, the Bengals have a reputation around the NFL for being cheap and that was fully on display last year when both Higgins and Chase were each trying to negotiate a new deal. After being hit with the franchise tag in 2024, Higgins was looking to get an extension, but based on comments from owner Mike Brown, it seems pretty clear that the Bengals weren't on the same page with Higgins about what he should get paid.  

""You can't just pay people willy nilly,"" Brown said in July 2024. ""You're restricted on how much you can pay, and we really like Tee Higgins. We would wish to sign him, but it has to be at a certain level to fit within the cap or it can't be done.""

As it turns out, you can pay people ""willy nilly"" if your star quarterback essentially demands it. Higgins and Chase were both clearly frustrated with the Bengals last season -- Chase even sat out all of training camp -- but the tide changed in the organization after a Monday night win over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 14. In that 27-20 victory, Burrow threw for 369 yards and three touchdowns, including a 40-yard game-winning score to Ja'Marr Chase with just 61 seconds left to play. 

Following the game, Burrow brought up Higgins' contract. 

""I'm confident that I think we're gonna be able to do what it takes to bring Tee back,"" Burrow said at the time. ""I know that I'm gonna do what it takes to get him back, and so is he. We've had those talks.""

At that point, it was as if Burrow decided that his new personal mission was to make sure the Bengals' core group of players stayed together. Two months later, the star QB showed up to Super Bowl week in New Orleans and while he was there, he sent a very clear message to the Bengals' front office: Get my guys under contract. 

""We have the cap space to get it done,"" Burrow said. ""I want to make it happen.""

Burrow specifically mentioned Chase, Higgins, Trey Hendrickson and Mike Gesicki. For the Bengals front office, this was Burrow holding their feet to the fire. 

After Burrow's media rounds at the Super Bowl, the Bengals basically had two options: 

Option 1: Make their star quarterback mad by not doing what he wants and make him even more upset by possibly trading away two of his guys (Higgins and Hendrickson). 

Option 2: Make their star quarterback happy by doing exactly what he wants. 

The Bengals tried Option 1 with Carson Palmer and that was a disaster. The former No. 1 overall pick became so frustrated with the organization that he eventually decided in 2011 that he'd rather retire than play for the Bengals. Not that Burrow was at that point, but you can bet the Bengals wanted to make sure he never came close to reaching it. 

Back in December, Palmer said he was starting to see ""frustration"" on Burrow's face, the same kind of frustration he felt during his eight seasons in Cincinnati. 

""It looks to be building and weighing on him,"" Palmer said.  

Burrow didn't reach the boiling point that Palmer reached and that's because the Bengals actually came through for Joey Franchise. 

Mike Brown once referred to NFL starting quarterbacks as the ""Queen Bees"" of the team. Yes, I had to watch an entire National Geographic documentary to fully understand his statement, but I can tell you this: The rest of the hive doesn't survive without the queen and Brown knows his team can't compete/survive without a true franchise quarterback. 

As long as Burrow is playing at a high level, he's going to get what he wants. Of the four players Burrow mentioned, the Bengals now have three of them under contract and it won't be surprising if they figure out a way to get a deal done with Hendrickson to complete Burrow's wish list (The two sides are already back at the negotiating table). 

Burrow put all the pressure on the Bengals, and now, with Higgins and Chase signed, the pressure is squarely back on him because he got exactly what he wanted. The band is back together, which means there can't be anymore slow starts, there can't be another season of missing the playoffs. If you tell your team these are the players you need to win, then you have to win. 

For the Bengals, there's also plenty of pressure. When you're paying your starting quarterback and his two favorite receivers an average of $124 million per year, that means you have to save money in other spots on the roster and you do that by drafting smart and finding low-cost free agents who can have an instant impact. So the pressure is on the Bengals to nail both the draft and the second wave of free agency. 

For the past few weeks, the Bengals' offseason felt like it was on the brink of disaster, but then the team backed up the Brinks truck to Chase and Higgins, and now, it feels like the organization has finally proven that it's going to do whatever it takes to win a Lombardi Trophy with Burrow.

Washington confronts fan shouting 'fire Nico' during free throw: 'Sick and tired of hearing it'","https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/mavs-p-j-washington-confronts-fan-shouting-fire-nico-during-free-throw-sick-and-tired-of-hearing-it/","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 01:02:47 GMT","

Dallas Mavericks fans are still in mourning (well, sports mourning, anyway) over the already infamous trade that sent franchise cornerstone Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers for a package centered around Anthony Davis. Things went downhill for Dallas immediately after the deal, as Davis was injured in his first game and has yet to return, while star guard Kyrie Irving was lost for the season due to a torn ACL in early March.

As a result, the Mavericks have absolutely cratered, going 1-6 since Irving's injury and falling from No. 8 to No. 10 in the Western Conference standings since the trade deadline.

The main culprit in the eyes of Mavericks fans has been general manager Nico Harrison, who took full responsibility for the trade that most experts still struggle to comprehend on any level. Since the deal was announced, Mavericks fans have made ""fire Nico"" a common refrain, even leading to one fan being removed from a February game after mouthing the words on the jumbotron.

The situation has clearly frustrated Mavericks forward P.J. Washington, who confronted a fan that shouted ""fire Nico"" twice while he was at the free-throw line during Dallas' 130-125 home loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday. Mavs forward Naji Marshall reportedly spoke to the fan after the first time he shouted it and then, after the fan repeated it, Washington yelled, ""Shut yo ass up"" before taking his second free throw.

Washington discussed the situation after the game, explaining why he no longer wants to hear ""fire Nico"" from Mavericks fans.

""At the end of the day, trades happen. We understand we have a new team now,"" Washington said. ""All that 'fire Nico' stuff, we're sick and tired of hearing it. We just want to go out there and play, and we want the fans to support us no matter who's on the floor. That's just how I feel about it.""

Mavericks guard Max Christie, who came over from the Lakers in the Dončić trade, also responded to the chants.

""Definitely not pleasant to hear, but I can't really comment much on that to be honest,"" Christie said. ""We get paid a lot of money just to play basketball, so for us, we have little things like that that may be distracting and what not -- it shouldn't affect us. We're professionals. We're the best at what we do in this sport. Distractions are gonna be there, and we gotta be able to move forward and move past them and not let those affect us.""

Christie's sentiment is one you generally hear from players, saying that fan behavior shouldn't have any bearing on their performance. But to Washington's point, it has to get extremely old hearing your own fans continually complain about something that happened over a month ago while the players are out there doing their best to try to win games and put an entertaining product on the floor.

Unfortunately for Washington and any other players who may be annoyed, it's likely not going to stop either until the Mavericks start winning again or they do, in fact, decide to fire Nico. And things may intensify the closer we get to Dončić's return to Dallas on April 9.

THE MEN'S NCAA TOURNAMENT FIELD ... 

The field is set (as are the schedule, the early-round odds and title odds), and we start at the top. The No. 1 seeds belong to ...  

Moving from the top of the field to the bubble, North Carolina was a shock inclusion, concluding a rollercoaster weekend.  

Texas, Xavier and San Diego State joined North Carolina in the ""Last Four In,"" and those four teams are headed to Dayton for the ""First Four.""  

One more headline: The SEC put 14 teams in the NCAA Tournament, not only breaking the previous record, but shattering it. The Big East had 11 teams qualify in 2011  

OK, time to dig deeper: Matt Norlander ranked every single team 1-68. Here's his top five:  

Minutes before the bracket arrived, Michigan won the Big Ten Tournament final over Wisconsin. But the 5-seed Wolverines got a rough draw, Isaac Trotter says.  

I wrote about the Tritons, so let me tell ya: They're a heck of a team ... and an even better story. As for Michigan, Kyle Boone says this seed doesn't make sense. 

Here's everything else:  

... AND EVERYONE IN THE WOMEN'S NCAA TOURNAMENT 

Moving onto the women's side (here's the bracket), the No. 1 seeds are ...  

You'll notice some big ones not listed there: Notre Dame, the top team in the nation in late February, fell all the way to a No. 3 seed after a tough closing stretch. UConn, meanwhile, got a No. 2 seed, but the Huskies have made 15 of the last 16 Final Fours, and they're in the top five of Isabel Gonzalez's ranking the field 1-68.  

Jack Maloney has his Selection Sunday winners and losers. It was a good day for UCLA and the Ivy League, a not-so-great day for Notre Dame and a mixed bag for South Carolina, which finds itself in both categories.  

Another team we still haven't mentioned? LSU. The Tigers are dangerous, Isabel writes in her 25 things to know.  

THE WEST VIRGINIA MOUNTAINEERS, THE INDIANA HOOSIERS AND THE REST OF THE NCAA TOURNAMENT  

What hurts the most is being so close. West Virginia and Indiana were the first two teams out of the NCAA Tournament, news that was especially crushing for the Mountaineers, who were not only in our bracketologist Jerry's field, but in all 111 projections on Bracket Matrix.  

We can quibble with a lot of things here. Several metrics, including the NET, favored North Carolina over both West Virginia and Indiana. But look at the Quad 1 records.  

There's a point in favor of the Mountaineers (and even the Hoosiers) over the Tar Heels. But, again, let's go back to West Virginia: Selection committee chair Bubba Cunningham noted Tucker DeVries' injury as something that was taken into account.  

That would make sense if DeVries' injury was a recent thing, and the team looked very different without him. But DeVries hasn't played since Dec. 6! The Mountaineers have four Quad 1 wins (including over Iowa State, a No. 3 seed, and at Kansas, a No. 7 seed) without him.  

Listen, no bracket is perfect. But that won't make the Mountaineers feel any better.   

After 72 holes weren't enough, Rory McIlroy and J.J. Spaun are in a three-hole playoff (holes 16, 17 and 18) at the Players Championship.  

You can follow our live coverage here.   

As one season ends for most college basketball teams, another one -- the offseason -- begins. Villanova fired Kyle Neptune, Iowa fired Fran McCaffrey, and UNLV fired Kevin Kruger as the coaching carousel accelerated.  

Villanova might be the most interesting. The Wildcats have legitimate NIL resources and, obviously, a tremendous track record of success, just not under Neptune. Isaac Trotter has candidates for 'Nova's next head coach, including ...  

We also have candidates for Iowa and Minnesota.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com","NFL free agency: Aaron Rodgers waiting to hear from this team before making possible decision, per report","https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-free-agency-aaron-rodgers-waiting-to-hear-from-this-team-before-making-possible-decision-per-report/","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 17:27:00 GMT","

There hasn't been much drama in free agency this week, well, except for the whole situation with Aaron Rodgers. The four-time MVP is a free agent for the first time in his career, and although he's had five days to talk with teams, he still hasn't made a decision about where he wants to play. 

If you're wondering why Rodgers is taking so long to decide, it seems that some of the blame for the delay belongs with the Minnesota Vikings. According to The Athletic, the Vikings are still having discussions what they want to do at quarterback in 2025,  and part of those discussions revolve around whether they want to make a play for Rodgers. 

The team still hasn't made a decision, so Rodgers ""is giving them time and waiting to hear from"" them, The Athletic has reported. Although the Steelers and Giants have been the two teams that have shown the most interest in Rodgers, the Vikings have long been viewed as a dark horse team to land him. 

As CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones noted on Friday, ""If the Vikings wanted [Aaron] Rodgers, he would already be a Minnesota Viking."" So now, as the Vikings try to make a decision, Rodgers is simply playing the waiting game. 

""If the Vikings wanted [Aaron] Rodgers, he would already be a Minnesota Viking.""@jjones9 with the latest on Aaron Rodgers' ongoing free agency. pic.twitter.com/FMw87wjCwo

The Vikings let Sam Darnold leave in free agency, and right now, the only two quarterbacks they have on the roster are two players -- J.J. McCarthy and Brett Rypien -- who both didn't take a single snap during the 2024 season. McCarthy, the 10th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, is coming off a devastating knee injury that caused him to miss the entire year, so the Vikings might be trying to figure out if it actually makes sense to go into the season with him as the starter. 

As things stand, the decision doesn't seem to be about money. According to The Athletic, the Giants have made the largest contract offer to Rodgers up to this point, and if it was all about money, he would have already accepted the offer. 

There are a lot of NFL minds who think that Rodgers would be a perfect fit in Minnesota and Rodgers might feel the same way, which would explain why he's willing to wait. Sauce Gardner thinks Rodgers should go to Minnesota: The Jets corner recently wrote on social media that Rodgers might lead the NFL in every stat if he ends up with the Vikings. 

Brett Favre also thinks Rodgers should do what he can to try and sign with the Vikings. 

""By all means, sign with them. They got a really good football team. They're loaded at pretty much every position,"" Favre said during an appearance on ""The Will Cain Show"" on Tuesday. 

Favre went from the Packers to the Jets to the Vikings in his career, and now, Rodgers has the chance to do the same thing.

Duke superstar freshman Cooper Flagg is ""full steam ahead"" to return on Friday for his team's opening NCAA Tournament game vs. the winner of the First Four matchup between No. 16 seeds Mount St. Mary's and American, Blue Devils coach Jon Scheyer said on Sunday. Flagg missed Duke's last two games -- including the ACC Tournament title game against Louisville -- after suffering an ankle injury against Georgia Tech.

""It's full steam ahead,"" Scheyer said on ESPN after the bracket was revealed. ""I want to get Coop back as quickly as we can. He wants to do the same. Obviously, tomorrow is important; we had an off day today and got back late. Hopefully he can start to progress starting tomorrow with doing some on-court work and build up to where can practice later in the week. Our goal is for Friday, no question about it. I know that's his goal as well.""

The projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft left Duke's ACC Tournament quarterfinal game against Georgia Tech with a sprained ankle. Without Flagg, Duke eked past arch-rival North Carolina on Friday night despite blowing a 23-point lead -- thanks, in part, to a fortuitous lane violation and defeated Louisville 73-62 in the conference title game.

NCAA Senior Vice President of Basketball Dan Gavitt told CBS Sports on Saturday that the selection committee had been in contact with Duke and the ACC ahead of the official bracket reveal.

""What we understand from communication with Duke and the ACC is that Cooper Flagg will be available for the NCAA Tournament,"" Gavitt said. ""So, don't expect that to impact their seeding. He is not the only significant injury we are tracking. ... player availability is always a concern and a consideration.""

Flagg sustained the injury with 2:46 remaining in the first half after rolling his ankle coming down for a defensive rebound. He immediately grabbed at his lower leg and lay writhing in pain on the court as trainers tended to him. Flagg was eventually helped off the floor with assistance back to the locker room area and later placed in a wheelchair to be taken to an exam room.

Flagg is averaging 18.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.1 assists this season.

Natasha Cloud will join the defending champions, while the Connecticut Sun will receive the No. 7 pick in the 2025 draft. 





The Connecticut Sun have traded Natasha Cloud to the New York Liberty in exchange for the No. 7 pick in the 2025 WNBA Draft, the team announced Sunday night. The Sun, who acquired Cloud in the trade that sent longtime franchise cornerstone Alyssa Thomas to the Phoenix Mercury, stocked up on draft capital, while the Liberty bolstered their already-talented roster with one of the game's elite two-way players. 

Cloud has averaged 8.6 points, 5.3 assists, 3.2 rebounds, and 1 steal in he 9-year WNBA career, 8 of which were with the Washington Mystics. An elite perimeter defender, she was named to the All-Defensive First Team once, and boasts two All-Defensive Second Team selections (2019, 2024). She won a WNBA championship with the Mystics in 2019, and will bring that experience to a locker room now intimately familiar with winning it all. 

The Athletic reported that Cloud had requested a trade soon after landing in Connecticut. Cloud told reporters in an Unrivaled media availability that she didn't expect to be traded after signing a deal with the Mercury. 

“I just want the best situation for myself and my family moving forward,” she said. “And I just want to be in an organization that truly invests from top to bottom, facilities, team, location, all of that. I want to compete for championships.”

In New York, Cloud will certainly get the chance to compete for one. 

The Liberty will look to defend their franchise-first WNBA title, and now bring another elite player into the fold. Sabrina Ionescu, Breanna Stewart, and Jonquel Jones headline the charge, but Cloud will provide an additional strong perimeter defender and playmaker, which is especially-needed considering the fact that Courtney Vandersloot signed with the Chicago Sky this offseason. 

“We could not be more excited to welcome Natasha Cloud to the New York Liberty family,” said Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb. “Tash is someone who we identified years ago as a prime fit for our team and embodies everything we look for in a player.”

“She has always left a lasting impression on the Barclays Center crowd, and we look forward to seeing the best fans in the WNBA embrace her on a nightly basis. Tash will undoubtedly strengthen our roster on both sides of the ball as we pursue another title in 2025.”

In addition to Vandersloot, the Liberty lost veteran forward Kayla Thornton this offseason, who was selected by the Golden State Valkyries in their expansion draft. Cloud will provide a scoring punch and a veteran presence that should aid the franchise as they pursue back-to-back titles. 

The Sun now own both the No. 7 and No. 8 picks in the 2025 WNBA Draft, in addition to last year's No. 5 overall pick, Jacy Sheldon. The move further signals the Sun are entering a rebuilding mode after losing their entire starting lineup this past offseason. The Sun retained veteran guard Marina Mabrey, and signed Hall of Fame center Tina Charles, but will mostly have young talent around them. Offloading a veteran player who wanted out in exchange for more young talent seems like a no-brainer move.

Let the bracket reactions begin. 

We have a bracket, and now we have three days to talk about it. Let's start immediately.

Here are 10 immediate thoughts on this year's field of 68:

There was little doubt that Sunday was going to be the day the SEC was going to set a new record for the most teams from a single conference in the same NCAA tournament. That happened in a major way, with a whopping 14 of the league's 16 teams hearing their name called. 

Texas was something of a surprise inclusion, and wasn't even close to being the last team in the field. The Longhorns were seeded higher than three other at-large teams, meaning they were actually just one spot away from avoiding Dayton and the First Four entirely. 

The other three teams that were considered to be on or at least near the bubble, made the field even more comfortably. Vanderbilt and Arkansas were safely clear of Dayton as 10-seeds, while Oklahoma earned a 9. 

The top of the league dominated the top three lines of the field, but that was to be expected. 

How about this for a quadrant: Rick Pitino and St. John's, Bill Self and Kansas, and John Calipari and Arkansas. Chris Crutchfield and Omaha will be there too, and their trashcan tradition is pretty cool, so there's that. 

The other two games played in Providence — which are Midwest Region contests — have the potential to be two of the first round's more entertaining tilts. Matt Painter and reigning national runner-up Purdue will face High Point and one of the nation's best offenses in one game, while Clemson — which made a regional final for the first time in program history last year — will square off against Will Wade (soon to be power conference head coach again Will Wade) and his mighty McNeese squad in what will assuredly be a trendy 12/5 upset pick. 

The fireworks inside Amica Mutal Pavilion figure to be abundant. 

All 111 of the Bracketologists tracked on BracketMatrix.com had West Virginia in the field of 68, making the Mountaineers the first unanimous selection in the history of the site to be excluded from the Big Dance. Just 50 Bracketologists had Texas in the tournament, and only 27 had North Carolina making the cut. 

Committee chair Bubba Cunningham said the Mountaineers were dinged for not having star  Tucker DeVries, who was declared out for the season in early February because of a shoulder injury. That seems a little strange and unfair considering DeVries played just the first eight games of the season for WVU, and the team was still able to amass a 10-10 Big 12 record that included wins over Kansas and Iowa State without him. 

In the first five seconds of the bracket reveal, we learned that Auburn, and not Duke, was tournament's No. 1 overall seed. About 15 seconds after that, we learned that Louisville, which finished second in the ACC regular season and tournament and which was projected by nearly everyone to be a 5 or 6-seed, was relegated to 8-seed status. 

Immediately, just about everyone who follows college basketball tweeted something along the lines of “well, this seems like the end for North Carolina.” So naturally, less than a minute later, we found out that the Tar Heels — who lost seven ACC games and went 1-12 in Quadrant-I opportunities — had somehow made the field.

Adding to the inconsistency was that Clemson, which had nearly identical metrics to Louisville and lost to the Cardinals in both their meetings — were seeded a full three lines higher at No. 5. 

Sometimes there's simply no rhyme or reason to these things. 

Everyone seems to be predicting that this is going to be the “chalkiest tournament since 2015,” or something along those lines. 

While the top two seed lines seem to be especially dominant this year, here's a friendly reminder: Every single Final Four but one since 2012 has featured at least one team seeded No. 7 or worse. Since 2011, a total of 13 teams seeded seventh or worse have crashed the season's final weekend, including 11th-seeded NC State last year. 

If there's another one this year, don't be surprised if it comes out of this region.

Top-seeded Houston has been rock solid once again all season, but is (also once again heading into the tournament) dealing with an injury to a key player in J'Wan Roberts. Second-seeded Tennessee has famously never beaten a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, and is widely considered to be the best program in college basketball without a single Final Four appearance. Third-seeded Kentucky has made a recent habit of taking shocking losses in the first round. Sure, that was under John Calipari, but new head coach Mark Pope has won a grand total of zero games in the Big Dance and has twice been beaten in the first round as a top six seed. 

Toss in Gonzaga as the 8-seed despite being No. 9 overall on Ken Pom as well as a pair of extremely dangerous double-digit seeds in McNeese and High Point, and don't be surprised if things get weird here. 

Allow me to be the millionth person today to point out how little sense this makes. 

North Carolina lost seven games in a dreadful ACC, went a combined 0-5 against the other at-large teams from the conference, and went 1-12 in Quadrant-I games overall. They were also the only team East of the Mississippi that Stanford beat on their home floor this season, good for a Quadrant-III loss. 

There's simply no reason — outside of brand recognition or a TV ratings boost for TruTV or, perhaps, their athletic director being the chairman for the Selection Committee — for the Tar Heels to be in this tournament. 

You know what other team had absolutely zero business making an NCAA tournament? The 2010-11 VCU Rams. They promptly shut everyone up by going from the First Four to the Final Four. 

Since then, there's been a trend among the final at-large teams in the field.

Since the inception of the First Four in 2011, a team coming out of Dayton has won at least one game in the tournament's “main draw” in every year but one. The only time it didn't happen was in 2019. That's fairly remarkable considering we're talking about just two 11 or 12 seeds every single year having the opportunity to make this happen. 

Overall, the First Four has produced a total of 22 victories in the “main draw” of the tournament, five Sweet 16 squads, and two Final Four teams, the most recent being UCLA three seasons ago.

North Carolina has underachieved dramatically this season. That doesn't mean they're lacking in talent. R.J. Davis is a former ACC Player of the Year who has showcased an ability to play March hero before, Ian Jackson is an NBA guy, and Eliot Cadeau was unbelievable down the stretch against Duke in the ACC tournament semifinals. 

Unqualified doesn't mean incapable. 

In 33 of the last 39 years, at least one 12 seed has advanced out of the first round of the tournament. Over the last 16 years, 12 seeds actually own a highly respectable overall record of 27-37 against five seeds, including a 2-2 mark last season. 

This year's 12-seed line is stacked.

UC San Diego is a top 40 team in virtually every metric and has a game against a Michigan team that, despite its run to the Big 10 tournament title, has been winning close all season. McNeese has lost once since mid-December and has maybe the most sought-after head coach in the sport. Mountain West champ Colorado State has won 10 straight and hasn't won a game by fewer than eight points over that stretch. Liberty beat both McNeese and Kansas State on a neutral court back in November and also won a 12/5 game under head coach Ritchie McKay back in 2019. 

At least one of these teams is winning this week.

BYU has scored 90 or more points in half of its last eight games, and has a pair of the most fun players in the tournament in Richie Saunders and Egor Demin. When the Cougars are on, there might not be a more entertaining team in the country. 

On the other side, there's all sort of buzz that VCU's Ryan Odom could be out the door for a power conference job after the Rams' run in the dance comes to an end. That has the potential to be a bit longer than those interested schools would like. The A-10 champs have lost just once since the start of February, and should have been an at-large selection even if they hadn't taken care of business in their league tournament. 

There was no bigger paradox this season than the Zags, who had the resume of an 8/9 team but the computer metrics of a top 2-seed. The common thought was that the Committee might split the difference and slot Gonzaga on the six or seven line to avoid giving a No. 1 seed a second round matchup against a team that ranks in the top 10 on KenPom and in the NET.

That didn't happen, and now the Zags are set to face Georgia in an 8/9 contest on Thursday. Houston is the lucky 1-seed likely awaiting the winner on Saturday. 

The seeding provided a significant hit to Gonzaga's chances of setting a new record for most consecutive Sweet 16 appearances. The Bulldogs have been to the second weekend nine years in a row, tied with Duke (1998-2006) and North Carolina (1985-1993) for the longest such streaks ever.

New research reveals that older adults who maintain strong cardiovascular health show fewer signs of brain degeneration—offering hope for preventing dementia and Alzheimer's through heart-smart living.

 Study: Cardiovascular Health and Biomarkers of Neurodegenerative Disease in Older Adults. Image Credit: crystal light / Shutterstock.com

A recent JAMA Network Open study investigates the association between cardiovascular health (CVH) and biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease.

The American Heart Association developed Life's Simple 7, a seven-item tool to support CVH in the general population by improving physical fitness and diet quality, maintaining a normal body mass index (BMI), and managing diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Individuals with a higher Life's Simple 7 score exhibit optimal CVH and are at a reduced risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

CVDs and neurodegenerative diseases like dementia and Alzheimer's disease share several common risk factors, some of which include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and cigarette smoking. Comparatively, optimal CVH may reduce the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases by slowing the rate of cognitive decline and reducing white matter hyperintensity volumes.

The current study investigates whether CVH influences several biomarkers of neurodegenerative processes, including serum levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) and total tau (t-tau). It also measured longitudinal changes in these biomarker levels over a 10-year period to determine whether these alterations vary between Black and White individuals.

Data were acquired from the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) study, a population-based study that identifies risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, and other types of dementia. The CHAP cohort comprised 10,802 Black and White American individuals who were 65 years or older from the South Side of Chicago. Demographic data, medical history, and serum samples were collected every three years between 1993 and 2012.

A total of 5,470 participants from the CHAP cohort were selected based on their willingness to provide serum samples. Among these individuals, 1,327 samples were randomly selected to measure NfL and t-tau levels.

The CVH score was developed using the Life's Simple 7 tool, which included different parameters, including BMI, diet, physical activity, diabetes, smoking status, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Each study participant was assigned a score of zero, one, or two based on their adherence to the seven cardiovascular health factors.

CVH scores ranged from zero and 14 points, with higher scores reflecting superior CVH.

A total of 1,018 CHAP study participants were selected for the final analysis. The mean age of this cohort was 73.1 years, 61.4% of whom were female, 59.9% were Black, and 40.1% were White.

Most study participants with a high CVH score between 10 and 14 points were White or reported higher education. Approximately 34.6% of study participants were carriers of at least one apolipoprotein e4 (APOE e4) allele, which reflects a genetic predisposition to developing Alzheimer's disease.

A higher CVH score was associated with lower serum concentrations of NfL, with a single point increase in CVH scores associated with significantly lower serum levels of NfL. Compared to study participants with CVH scores between zero and 6, individuals with high CVH scores were likelier to have considerably lower levels of NfL. No association between CVH and serum t-tau concentrations was observed for each one-point increase in CVH score.

Higher CVH scores were statistically associated with a reduction in NfL levels among APOE e4 carriers only. These observed associations between CVH and NfL were not dependent on race.

Baseline CVD did not influence the association between CVH scores and NfL levels. Notably, higher CVH scores were associated with a slower annual increase in NfL levels as participants aged. However, the CVH score did not influence annual changes in t-tau concentrations.

Serum NfL and t-tau levels across CVH score ranges were also measured during the 10-year follow-up period. To this end, individuals with the lowest CVH scores experienced an annual increase in NfL levels by 7.1%, whereas those with the highest CVH scores exhibited an annual increase in NfL rates by 5.2%.

Older individuals with better CVH had lower serum concentrations of NfL, irrespective of age, sex, and race. For individuals carrying the APOE e4 allele, a greater CVH score was significantly associated with lower levels of NfL.

These findings emphasize the importance of maintaining optimal CVH to reduce the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases. This is particularly important in Black adults, who are often at a greater risk of developing CVDs.

Promoting CVH in older adults may help reduce the burden of neurodegenerative diseases.”

Think red wine is safer? A new study shows both red and white wines carry similar cancer risks—but white wine may pack an extra punch when it comes to skin cancer.

 Study: Consumption of Red Versus White Wine and Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies. Image Credit: Africa Studio / Shutterstock.com 

A recent study published in the journal Nutrients explores whether the incidence of cancer differs depending on whether one consumes red or white wine.

Over several decades ago, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified alcoholic beverages as Group 1 carcinogens, thus indicating that no level of alcohol consumption is considered safe for human health. Some of the most common types of cancer that can be directly linked to alcohol use include bowel cancer and female breast cancer. In 2020, approximately 4.1% of total global cancer cases were due to alcohol consumption.

After alcohol is consumed, the liver metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde, a highly reactive and toxic compound. Acetaldehyde can form Schiff-base adducts with DNA and cellular proteins, increasing the risk of point mutations and DNA-DNA and DNA-protein crosslinks.

It is generally perceived that red wine is a healthier option than white wine because it contains a higher number of antioxidants, such as polymeric tannins and flavonoids. Interestingly, a recent Canadian survey indicated that 41% of respondents were not certain whether or not red wine reduced cancer risk despite being aware that alcohol consumption can lead to cancer.

Previous studies have shown that resveratrol, a polyphenol compound found in red wine, restricts the proliferation of different types of cancer cells. However, several epidemiologic studies have contradicted these findings, indicating that red wine consumption increases the risk of many cancers, including those affecting the lungs, ovaries, skin, and breast.

To date, few studies have evaluated differences in cancer risk by type of wine.

The current study reviewed published research to identify any potential differences in the carcinogenicity risk between red and white wine. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between red and white wine consumption and the risk of all and site-specific cancers.

All relevant studies published until December 2023 were obtained from PubMed and Embase databases. The current meta-analysis included only prospective cohort and case-control studies with more than three categories of wine consumption.

The midpoint of the wine intake range was established for each included study. For the dose-response analysis, wine intake was measured in grams of ethanol per day.

A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to measure relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for an association between wine intake and overall cancer risk.

Of the 252 articles obtained from the primary search, 42 articles, 20 and 22 of which were cohort and case-control studies, respectively, were selected for the meta-analysis. RRs for overall cancer risk were 0.98 for red wine and 1.00 for white wine. Thus, no difference was observed between red and white wine consumption in terms of overall cancer risk.

When only cohort studies were considered, a stronger and more significant association was observed between white wine and cancer risk, whereas no association was observed for red wine intake. Although no significant difference between red and white wine consumption on overall cancer risk was observed in men, this association was significant in women.

Dose-response analyses using case-control data revealed that every additional 10 grams of ethanol from red wine per day was associated with a 5% increase in overall cancer risk. However, this association was not observed in cohort studies.

White wine consumption was associated with a 22% increased risk of skin cancer compared to red wine consumption. Both wine types were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, with no significant difference in incidence risk rates between the wine types. After removing the most influential study, no significant difference was observed between red and white wine on overall cancer risk.

The study findings confirm that red and white wine are associated with a similar risk of developing cancer. However, only white wine was associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.

Drinking red wine may not be any better than drinking white wine in terms of cancer risk.”

How postbiotics work
Potential health benefits
Comparison with probiotics and prebiotics
Future of postbiotics

Postbiotics, defined as bioactive compounds produced by beneficial microbes such as lactic acid bacteria during the fermentation of prebiotic substrates, have recently gained significant attention in health sciences. Unlike probiotics, which contain live microorganisms, postbiotics include non-living microbial cells, cellular structures, and metabolites such as bacteriocins, exopolysaccharides, and peptidoglycan.1

Postbiotics' rising popularity stems from notable advantages over probiotics, including enhanced stability, safety, and longer shelf life. These advantages reduce the risks associated with live microbial consumption, such as potential pathogen transmission and antimicrobial resistance. Increasing research highlights postbiotics' beneficial mechanisms, primarily their ability to modulate protective actions against pathogens, fortify epithelial barriers, and regulate immune responses.

Due to these promising health effects, postbiotics are gaining traction across various sectors, especially in the food industry for bio-preservation and in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields for treating gastrointestinal disorders and enhancing immune functions.

This growing interest aligns with the demand for safe and effective functional foods addressing sub-health conditions, promoting general well-being, and managing gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea and bloating. As scientific understanding deepens, postbiotics stand poised to complement probiotics significantly, marking a transformative shift towards comprehensive, preventive healthcare strategies and innovative therapeutic applications.1

This article explores postbiotics, explaining what they are, how they differ from probiotics, and their potential benefits for gut health.

Unlike probiotics, postbiotics do not contain live cells but consist of metabolites, including bacteriocins, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and various organic acids. Their production involves controlled fermentation processes followed by techniques such as enzymatic hydrolysis, thermal treatment, and extraction, ensuring the isolation of the beneficial compounds while maintaining their biological efficacy.2,3

The primary mode of action of postbiotics involves modifying the gut environment, thereby enhancing the gut microbiota composition. They reduce intestinal pH, creating conditions that selectively favor beneficial microbes while suppressing pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Clostridium perfringens.

Specifically, SCFAs produced as postbiotic metabolites act as energy substrates for intestinal cells, facilitating the growth of beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. This results in improved intestinal barrier function, reduction in inflammation, and enhanced resistance to pathogenic colonization.2,3

In addition, postbiotics modulate the immune response by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines and downregulating pro-inflammatory signals. This balanced immune modulation reduces gut inflammation, enhancing overall gastrointestinal health and resilience.2

Research highlights postbiotics' significant role in promoting growth performance, particularly in poultry. Dietary supplementation with postbiotics has been shown to improve nutrient absorption, optimize feed efficiency, and support better overall animal growth. For example, poultry-fed diets enriched with postbiotics demonstrate increased body weight gain, improved feed conversion rates, and healthier gut morphology compared to control groups.2,3

Moreover, postbiotics positively affect the quality of animal products. In poultry, the inclusion of postbiotics in diets leads to improvements in meat characteristics, including increased tenderness, reduced lipid peroxidation, enhanced color, and overall better sensory properties.2

Postbiotics contain bioactive substances, including SCFAs, exopolysaccharides, bacteriocins, and various proteins. These compounds exhibit diverse functional properties that are beneficial for gut and overall health.

For instance, SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, produced from microbial fermentation, are notable for their capacity to strengthen the gut barrier by enhancing the integrity of tight junction proteins, thus preventing pathogen invasion and systemic inflammation.4

The anti-inflammatory properties of postbiotics significantly contribute to their health benefits. Studies have shown that these metabolites can modulate inflammatory responses by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6).

For example, specific proteins derived from Lactobacillus species, such as surface-layer proteins (SLPs), demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by reducing Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B (NF-κB) activation, a key pathway in inflammation.4

Postbiotics further support immune functions by influencing mucosal immunity. They promote the growth of beneficial gut microbiota, directly compete with pathogenic bacteria for adhesion sites, and enhance mucosal defense mechanisms through antimicrobial peptides. Research has shown that postbiotic administration increases beneficial microbes like Bifidobacteria while decreasing harmful pathogens such as Escherichia coli.4

Emerging evidence also suggests postbiotics can aid metabolic regulation, demonstrating potential anti-obesity and glucose homeostasis effects. Their stability, safety profile, and efficacy make them an attractive alternative or complement to probiotics, especially in immunocompromised individuals.

While extensive research continues to expand understanding of the mechanisms and specific health outcomes associated with postbiotics, current findings underscore their potential in clinical nutrition and therapy.4

Prebiotics and Probiotics: What's the Difference?

Probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics are integral elements in gut microbiome management, each playing a unique yet interconnected role. Probiotics are live beneficial microorganisms, like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, directly impacting gut microbial composition and health. Prebiotics, such as inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), act as food for these beneficial bacteria, enhancing their proliferation and activity.5

Postbiotics, the latest addition to microbiome-focused interventions, represent non-living microbial cells or bioactive substances produced by probiotics during fermentation. Unlike probiotics, postbiotics are stable and less susceptible to environmental stressors such as heat or stomach acids, making them particularly advantageous in formulation and shelf stability.

They offer benefits like modulating immune responses, enhancing gut barrier integrity, and exerting anti-inflammatory effects without the risks associated with administering live microorganisms, especially in immunocompromised individuals.5

Several postbiotic products have entered the market, including heat-killed Lactobacillus plantarum preparations used to manage gastrointestinal discomfort and fermented formulas containing SCFAs to support gut health.5

However, postbiotic commercialization faces regulatory hurdles, primarily due to inconsistent definitions and the complex classification between dietary supplements and medicinal products. Regulatory bodies differ internationally, complicating standardized approvals.5

Integrating postbiotics into the broader microbiome conversation requires clearer regulatory frameworks and robust clinical evidence. Their continued development alongside probiotics and prebiotics promises to enrich microbiome management, offering safer and potentially more effective solutions for maintaining gut and overall health.5

Emerging research indicates postbiotics offer superior stability, safety, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional probiotics. Unlike probiotics, postbiotics withstand harsh gastrointestinal conditions, have extended shelf-life, and eliminate risks associated with live bacterial strains.5,6

Current market products include pasteurized Akkermansia muciniphila, utilized for obesity and insulin resistance management, and heat-inactivated Bifidobacterium bifidum (e.g., MIMBb75), effective against Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Additionally, bacterial lysate OM-85 (Broncho-Vaxom) is commercially available for respiratory immune support.6

Clinical trials and pre-clinical studies underline diverse medical applications. For instance, postbiotics like SCFAs, especially butyrate, demonstrate anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects beneficial in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disorders.

In food industries, postbiotic applications include functional food ingredients enhancing nutritional profiles and shelf-life stability.6

Despite promising advances, regulatory challenges persist. Clear guidelines distinguishing postbiotics from probiotics remain underdeveloped, complicating product standardization, labeling, and market authorization. Current regulations primarily address viable probiotics, necessitating updated frameworks explicitly tailored for postbiotic substances.6

Ongoing clinical studies continue to evaluate the efficacy, safety profiles, and mechanistic actions of various postbiotic compounds, promising deeper insights and validation of therapeutic claims. Addressing existing knowledge gaps through rigorous clinical research will be crucial for the successful integration and acceptance of postbiotics within mainstream medicine and the food industry.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net","Checking the facts on Medicaid use by Latinos","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250317/Checking-the-facts-on-Medicaid-use-by-Latinos.aspx","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:37:00 GMT","

Spending cuts, immigration, and Medicaid are at the top of the Washington agenda. That climate provides fertile ground for misinformation and myths to multiply on social networks. Some of the most common are those surrounding immigrants, Latinos, and Medicaid.

These claims include assertions that Latinos who use Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people and those with disabilities, ""do not work"" and exaggerations of the percentage of people with Medicaid who are Latinos.

The U.S. House voted narrowly on Feb. 25 in favor of a budget blueprint that could lead to Medicaid cuts of up to $880 billion over a decade.

Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program are part of the national safety net, covering about 80 million people. Medicaid enrollment grew under the Affordable Care Act and after the start of the covid-19 pandemic but then started falling during the final two years of the Biden administration.

Immigrants' impact on the nation's health care system can be overstated in heated political rhetoric. Now-Vice President JD Vance said on the campaign trail last year that ""we're bankrupting a lot of hospitals by forcing these hospitals to provide care for people who don't have the legal right to be in our country."" PolitiFact rated that statement ""False.""

KFF Health News, in partnership with Factchequeado, compiled five myths circulating on social media and analyzed them with experts in the field.

1. Do Latinos who receive Medicaid work?

Most do. A KFF analysis of Medicaid data found that almost 67% of Latinos on Medicaid work, ""which is a higher share of Medicaid adults who are working compared to other racial and ethnic groups,"" said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

""For many low-income people, the myth is that they are not working, even though we know from a lot of data that many people work but don't have access to affordable employer-sponsored insurance,"" said Timothy McBride, co-director at the Center for Advancing Health Services, Policy and Economics Research, part of the Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis.

Neither the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health nor the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services responded to requests for comment.

2. Are Latinos the largest group enrolled in Medicaid?

No. White people who are not Hispanic represent the biggest demographic group in Medicaid and CHIP. The programs' enrollment is 42% non-Hispanic white, 28% Latinos, and 18% non-Hispanic Black, with small percentages of other minorities, according to a CMS document.

Latinos' share of total Medicaid enrollment ""has remained fairly stable for many years — hovering between 26 and 30% since at least 2008,"" said Gideon Lukens, research and data analysis director on the health policy team at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research organization.

In a Feb. 18 blog post, Alex Nowrasteh and Jerome Famularo of the libertarian Cato Institute wrote: ""The biggest myth in the debate over immigrant welfare use is that noncitizens — which includes illegal immigrants and those lawfully present on various temporary visas and green cards — disproportionately consume welfare. That is not the case."" They included Medicaid in the term ""welfare.""

Although Latinos are not the biggest group in Medicaid, they are the demographic group with the greatest percentage of people receiving Medicaid. There are about 65.2 million Hispanics in the country, representing 19.5% of the total U.S. population.

Approximately 31% of the Latino population is enrolled in Medicaid, in part because employed Latinos often have jobs that do not offer affordable insurance.

Eligibility for Medicaid is based on factors such as income, age, and pregnancy or disability status, and it varies from state to state, said Kelly Whitener, associate professor of practice at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.

""Medicaid eligibility is not based on race or ethnicity,"" Whitener said.

3. Do most Latinos living in the country without legal permission use Medicaid?

No. Under federal law, immigrants lacking legal status are not eligible for federal Medicaid benefits.

As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia had used their own funds to expand coverage to children in the country without regard to immigration status. Of those, seven states and D.C. expanded coverage to some adults regardless of immigration status.

The cost of providing health care to these beneficiaries is covered entirely by the states. The federal government does not put up a penny.

The federal government does pay for Emergency Medicaid, which reimburses hospitals for medical emergencies for people who, because of their immigration status or other factors, do not normally qualify for the program.

Emergency Medicaid began in 1986 under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, signed by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican.

In 2023, Emergency Medicaid accounted for 0.4% of total Medicaid spending.

Some conservative lawmakers say immigrants in the country illegally should not get any Medicaid benefits.

""Medicaid is meant for American citizens who need it most — seniors, children, pregnant women, and the disabled,"" Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) said on social media. ""But liberal states are finding ways to game the system and make taxpayers cover healthcare for illegal immigrants.""

4. Do Latinos stay on Medicaid for decades?

Experts say there is no analysis by race or ethnicity of the length of time people use the program.

""The people who stay on Medicaid the longest are people who have Medicaid due to a disability and who live with a medical situation that does not change,"" Tolbert said.

People who use long-term Medicaid support services represent 6% of the total number of people in the program.

Many beneficiaries are in the program temporarily, McBride said.

""Some studies indicate that as many as half of the people on Medicaid churn off of Medicaid within a short period of time,"" he said, such as within a year.

5. Are Latinos on Medicaid the group that uses medical services the most?

Latinos do not use significantly more Medicaid services than others, experts say. Latinos receive preventive services (such as mammograms, pap smears, and colonoscopies), primary care and mental health care less than other groups, according to documents from CMS and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, a nonpartisan organization that provides policy and data analysis.

Latinos do account for a disproportionate share of Medicaid labor and delivery services. Latino families and white families each represent about 35% of Medicaid births, although white people make up a bigger share of the overall population.

While Latinos represent 28% of all Medicaid and CHIP enrollees, they account for 37% of beneficiaries with limited benefits that cover only specific services.

""They actually use health care services less than other groups, because of systemic barriers such as limited English proficiency and difficulty navigating the system,"" said Arturo Vargas Bustamante, a professor at UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health and the faculty research director at the university's Latino Policy and Politics Institute.

Latino people also avoid using services out of fear of the ""public charge"" rule and other policies, Vargas Bustamante said. President Donald Trump expanded the public charge policy and strongly enforced it during his first term, though it was softened under President Joe Biden. The policy was intended to make it harder for immigrants who use Medicaid or welfare programs to obtain green cards or become U.S. citizens.

""The chilling effect of public charge persists, but recent orders such as mass deportation or the elimination of birthright citizenship have generated their own chilling effects,"" Vargas Bustamante added.

That's not quite right.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250317/Congressman-blames-Trump-team-for-ending-telehealth-Medicare-benefit-Thate28099s-not-quite-right.aspx","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 17:06:00 GMT","

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) posted a Tiktok video on Feb. 20 saying he had ""breaking news"" about the fate of Medicare coverage for telehealth visits, which allow patients to see health care providers remotely from their homes.

""Breaking news: The Trump administration just announced that Medicare will stop covering telehealth starting April 1,"" Khanna said. ""We need to stand up to these Medicare cuts.""

The same day, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services posted a document online titled ""Telehealth"" that said, ""Through March 31, 2025, you can get telehealth services at any location in the U.S., including your home. Starting April 1, 2025, you must be in an office or medical facility located in a rural area (in the U.S.) for most telehealth services.""

CMS did not respond to requests for comment about the post. The White House also did not respond to requests for comment.

The telehealth benefit was first put in place as a temporary Trump-era addition to Medicare coverage during the covid-19 public health emergency.

Khanna's statement took on more significance leading up to the threat of a government shutdown, but late last week Congress averted one by approving a stopgap spending bill.

The expiration date for the benefit has been known since December, when Congress extended coverage around telehealth through March 31. The roughly 90-day reprieve was part of a compromise after then-President-elect Donald Trump and his ally Elon Musk criticized a sweeping, end-of-year legislative package that would have, among other things, continued those benefits for two years.

Their opposition forced Congress to pass a stripped-down version of the end-of-year bill. Telehealth's two-year extension, included in the initial bill, became collateral damage.

Last week, just as the clock was ticking down, House Republicans passed a spending bill for the rest of the fiscal year that includes another extension of telehealth flexibilities — this one lasting through September. The Senate then cleared the bill for Trump's signature, with the support of 10 Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Regardless, the two-year extension proposed in December — or a permanent extension, as Khanna has urged — looks unlikely.

""President Trump and Elon Musk blew up the continuing resolution last December that would have extended these telehealth authorities by two years,"" Khanna told us via email. ""Trump should work with Congress to extend telehealth coverage for Medicare beneficiaries.""

It wouldn't come free. Permanently extending telehealth for medical care under Medicare could cost taxpayers about $25 billion over 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated. The CBO calculated five months of expanded telehealth coverage as costing $663 million, and calculated that that would total almost $25 billion through fiscal year 2031 if spending remained level, which it may not do.

Also, the agency and the Government Accountability Office have raised concerns about fraud and overuse of the benefit, among other potential issues.

Congress made Medicare coverage of behavioral health services delivered remotelypermanent in December 2020, but left other telehealth benefits hanging on by a string. Instead, lawmakers extended them for short periods during the nearly two years since the public health emergency officially ended in May 2023.

""Now, once again, we've got another deadline where, if Congress doesn't act, our flexibilities go away,"" said Kyle Zebley, senior vice president of public policy for the American Telemedicine Association.

And if, at some point, the telehealth benefits aren't extended, is it fair to describe the policy change as a cut? Khanna, for instance, plans to introduce the Telehealth Coverage Act, which would require Medicare to cover seniors' telehealth services.

Politically speaking, it's a powerful question when trying to leverage public support — and politicians in both parties often accuse their opponents of ""cutting"" federal benefits when they make changes to programs.

""Khanna is overly dramatic,"" said Joseph Antos, a senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.

If the provision expires, Antos said, ""this is not a Trump cut.""

But beneficiaries might have a different experience. Since the early days of the pandemic — five years now — millions of patients have come to rely on telehealth for their medical services. That benefit, even with another temporary reprieve, would still be at risk.

According to CMS, more than 1 in 10 Medicare beneficiaries used virtual care services as of 2023. And, after the Trump administration green-lighted telehealth for Medicare recipients in 2020, many private insurers did the same.

Overall telehealth claims in Medicare rose from fewer than 1% of all claims before the covid pandemic to a peak of 13% in April 2020. Now they stand at close to 5%, according to Fair Health, a nonprofit that tracks health care costs.

Those in the telehealth industry are optimistic about the current extension. The Trump administration, they say, has been sending encouraging signals — even highlighting its previous support of telemedicine in its fact sheet on the launch of the President's Make America Healthy Again Commission.

""We've been sweating bullets,"" Zebley said. ""But it's been nerve-wracking before. I think we're going to get it done.""

Antos said, however, that after the extension in the House-passed spending bill, Medicare's telemedicine benefits could be dead.

Khanna said, ""Breaking news: The Trump administration just announced that Medicare will stop covering telehealth starting April 1. … We need to stand up to these Medicare cuts.""

The statement is partially accurate, because the Trump administration announced the March 31 sunset of Medicare telehealth visits, and some beneficiaries who were using that benefit could see it as a ""cut."" But the claim lacks key context that the expiration date was set by Congress, not the Trump administration.

After Khanna's claim, Congress extended access to telehealth coverage through September.

Based on information that was available at the time, we rate Khanna's statement Half True.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net","Scientists say NIH officials told them to scrub mRNA references on grants","http://www.news-medical.net/news/20250317/Scientists-say-NIH-officials-told-them-to-scrub-mRNA-references-on-grants.aspx","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:33:00 GMT","

National Institutes of Health officials have urged scientists to remove all references to mRNA vaccine technology from their grant applications, two researchers said, in a move that signaled the agency might abandon a promising field of medical research.

The mRNA technology is under study at the NIH for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, including flu and AIDS, and also cancer. It was deployed in the development of covid-19 vaccines credited with saving 3 million lives in the U.S. alone — an accomplishment President Donald Trump bragged about in his first term.

A scientist at a biomedical research center in Philadelphia wrote to a colleague, in an email reviewed by KFF Health News, that a project officer at NIH had ""flagged our pending grant as having an mRNA vaccine component.""

""It's still unclear whether mRNA vaccine grants will be canceled,"" the scientist added.

NIH officials also told a senior NIH-funded vaccine scientist in New York state, who does not conduct mRNA vaccine research but described its efficacy in previous grant applications, that all references to mRNA vaccines should be scrubbed from future applications.

Scientists relayed their experiences on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional retaliation by the Trump administration.

A senior official at the National Cancer Institute confirmed that NIH acting Director Matthew Memoli sent an email across the NIH instructing that any grants, contracts, or collaborations involving mRNA vaccines be reported up the chain to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s office and the White House.

Memoli sent a similar message ahead of the agency canceling other research, such as studies of vaccine hesitancy.

Memoli's email on that topic bluntly stated that NIH was not interested in learning why people shun vaccines or in exploring ways to ""improve vaccine interest and commitment.""

The National Cancer Institute official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said that ""it is reasonable to assume mRNA vaccine work is next.""

The official said a similar memo also went out regarding NIH-funded work in South Africa, which the White House has targeted over false claims that the country's government is persecuting white people. More recently, another one went out regarding all global research collaborations, the official said.

Spokespeople for the White House, HHS, and the NIH did not respond to requests for comment.

The NIH, whose latest annual budget was $47 billion, is one of the world's most critical sources of funding for basic biomedical research. Its mission and programs are under unprecedented scrutiny from Trump's White House and the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-led agency created by a Trump executive order that has directed federal agencies to prepare for widespread layoffs.

The NIH is funding at least 130 studies involving the mRNA technology in covid vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna that have been administered to billions of people worldwide.

A former government official familiar with internal discussions said that the Trump administration intends to cut some grants for mRNA vaccine research but that the timing is unclear. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships with the administration.

Political conservatives in the U.S. have promulgated conspiracy theories, unsupported by scientific evidence, that the shots and their relatively new technology are dangerous. This has undermined public support for covid vaccinations and mRNA research.

""There will not be any research funded by NIH on mRNA vaccines,"" the scientist in New York said in an interview. ""MAGA people are convinced that these vaccines have killed and maimed tens of thousands of people. It's not true, but they believe that.""

Meanwhile, hundreds of other vaccine-related studies are in limbo. Kawsar Talaat, a vaccine researcher at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, has been waiting since the fall for money needed to recruit subjects for a study of an antidiarrheal vaccine.

""NIH approved our funding,"" she said, ""and now we're waiting, and we don't know if it's going forward or going to be killed.""

The scientist in Philadelphia signaled that he believes Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, is responsible for the NIH's turn against mRNA research.

""Kennedy's war on vaccines has started,"" the scientist told his colleague.

The scientist in New York said that it was ""ridiculous"" to remove mRNA language from the grant applications. But ""if my grant is rejected for any reason,"" the scientist said, ""people in my lab will lose their jobs.""

""I've worked with some of them for 20 years,"" the scientist added. ""They have children and families. There is a real climate of fear in academia about this now, especially among vaccine scientists.""

""My grant does not involve a request for funds to conduct mRNA vaccine experiments,"" the scientist said, ""so my principal concern was to avoid word-search flags that, at minimum, would lead to delays in any funding.""

While tenured research professors at universities generally receive a salary from their institution, the staffers who work in their labs and offices are often paid through NIH grants. The 2023 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was given to two scientists for developing mRNA vaccines, through work that relied on pharmaceutical companies and on NIH scientists working under infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci.

According to Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the chamber's Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Kennedy promised during his Senate confirmation process that he would protect ""the public health benefit of vaccination"" and ""work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems.""

Cassidy, a physician, had expressed reservations about confirming Kennedy to the HHS post and challenged his anti-vaccine views during a confirmation hearing. He ended up voting for him, he said, because Kennedy had agreed to work closely with Cassidy and his committee.

However, Kennedy has faced scrutiny in his first weeks in office for his handling of a large measles outbreak among mostly unvaccinated people in Texas that has led to the death of a child, the first U.S. measles death in more than a decade. A patient who tested positive for measles died in New Mexico, but the cause hasn't been confirmed. Instead of urging vaccination against the disease, an almost surefire way to prevent infection, Kennedy has blamed malnourishment for the outbreak, promoted unproven treatments for measles, and falsely claimed in one Fox News interview that the vaccine is ineffective and even dangerous.

Cassidy did not respond to a request for comment on the NIH's potential abandonment of mRNA vaccine research.

As part of the Trump administration's push to examine spending on mRNA vaccines, health officials are reviewing a $590 million contract for bird flu shots that the Biden administration awarded to Moderna, Bloomberg News has reported. Legislation introduced by GOP lawmakers in at least seven states is aimed at banning or limiting mRNA vaccines. In some cases, the measures would hit doctors who give the injections with criminal penalties, fines, and the possible revocation of their licenses.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net","Scientist whose work led FDA to ban food dye says agency overstated risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250317/Scientist-whose-work-led-FDA-to-ban-food-dye-says-agency-overstated-risk.aspx","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:39:00 GMT","

When the FDA announced in January, before President Joe Biden's term ended, that it would ban a dye called red dye No. 3 in food and ingested drugs, the federal agency cited just one 1987 study on rats to support its action.

The industry-funded study, based on data from two prior studies, was led by a Virginia toxicologist who said then — and still believes today, decades after concerns first arose that the chemical could be carcinogenic — that his research found the petroleum-derived food coloring doesn't cause cancer in humans.

""If I thought there was a problem, I would have stated it in the paper,"" Joseph Borzelleca, 94, a professor emeritus of pharmacology and toxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University, told KFF Health News after the FDA's announcement. ""I have no problem with my family — my kids and grandkids — consuming Red 3. I stand by the conclusions in my paper that this is not a problem for humans.""

Soon after Borzelleca's paper was published in a scientific journal, Food and Chemical Toxicology, the FDA examined the data his team had collected and reached its own conclusion: that the dye caused cancer in male lab rats. In 1990, the FDA cited the study in banning Red 3 in cosmetics.

In 1992, the FDA said it wanted to revoke approval of Red 3 in food and drugs. But the agency didn't act at the time, citing a lack of resources.

More than 30 years later, after a renewed push by consumer advocates, the Biden administration announced the ban in its last days in power. The move came just weeks before the Senate confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA.

Kennedy has been a vocal critic of food additives, including Red 3. On March 10 he met with top food industry executives and told them if they don't eliminate artificial food dyes from their products, the federal government will force them to do so, Food Fix reported.

Consumer advocacy groups cheered the Red 3 ban, even as the FDA said there is no evidence that the dye is dangerous to people. ""Importantly, the way that FD&C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not occur in humans,"" Jim Jones, FDA deputy commissioner for human foods, said in a statement.

Jones resigned from FDA in February, criticizing Trump administration cuts that he said hobbled his office.

The FDA did not respond to a request for comment, but Marty Makary, Trump's nominee to lead the agency, said at his Senate confirmation hearing on March 6 that he is concerned about whether food additives such as Red 3 harm children.

""It did not make sense that red dye No. 3 was banned in cosmetics but allowed in the food supply,"" Makary told Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who questioned why the FDA ban doesn't take effect until 2027.

""We want to kill people for two more years?"" the Alabama Republican said. ""I would hope that you would, if you're confirmed, you'd go in and look at it very quickly and say, 'Why do we want to put our people in harm's way?'""

The International Association of Color Manufacturers says Red 3 is safe in the tiny levels typically consumed by humans. The dye was approved for use in foods in the U.S. in 1907, and today it's an ingredient in thousands of products including cereals, candy, beverages, and cake toppings.

Thomas Galligan, principal scientist for food additives and supplements at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which petitioned the FDA for a ban, said that a federal regulation known as the Delaney Clause prohibits any ingredient that causes cancer in animals from being included in foods. (The publisher of KFF Health News, David Rousseau, is on the CSPI board.)

""At the end of the day, this is an unnecessary additive,"" he said. ""It's a marketing tool for the industry to make foods look more appealing so consumers will buy them. But federal law is clear: No amount of cancer risk is acceptable in foods.""

Galligan said he was not surprised Borzelleca's opinion on Red 3 had not changed or that the food dye industry has played down the risk.

In October 2023, California became the first state to ban Red 3 in food starting in 2027, superseding the FDA's earlier rule allowing small amounts in foods as a color additive. The state legislature acted after a state analysis concluded the dye could cause hyperactivity in children.

The European Union, Australia, and Japan are among the locations that already ban the chemical in foods. The EU's ban also cites hyperactivity in children. The EU requires food makers to include a warning that food dyes that are still allowed may “have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.”

The IACM points to research by scientific committees operated by the World Health Organization, including a 2018 review that affirmed the safety of Red 3 in food.

Some food manufacturers have already reformulated products to remove Red 3. In its place they use beet juice; carmine, a dye made from insects; or pigments from foods such as purple sweet potato, radish, and red cabbage.

It isn't clear how the FDA determined that Red 3 can cause cancer in male rats. Borzelleca's paper said some rats that were fed Red 3 developed polyps in their thyroid gland but doesn't mention cancer.

Borzelleca, whose study was funded by the IACM, then known as the Certified Color Manufacturers Association, said he was stunned the FDA banned the dye and used his research to back the move.

""I am surprised all this time has gone by and it's been safe for human use, and now it's being pulled from the market due to concerns not supported by the data,"" Borzelleca said. ""Our study did not find this was a carcinogen.""

His study was a response to the FDA's requirement in the 1980s for additional long-term feeding studies in rats and mice as a condition for the continued provisional approval of several color additives, including Red 3.

Over decades, Borzelleca published dozens of research papers on the toxicology of food additives, pesticides, and water contaminants. He also served on advisory boards for the tobacco industry and represented cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds in negotiations with the Department of Health and Human Services about cigarette additives, according to a 1984 corporate memo.

Surgical removal of enlarged tonsils and adenoids in children with mild sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) appears to significantly reduce the frequency of medical office visits and prescription medicine use in this group, according to a clinical study supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The findings, published in JAMA Pediatrics, show that the surgery, called adenotonsillectomy, was tied to a 32% reduction in medical visits and a 48% reduction in prescription use among children with a mild form of the condition.

SDB refers to breathing disturbances during sleep that can range from loud snoring to occasional breathing pauses. About 6 to 17% of children in the United States have it, and for those with moderate to severe cases, adenotonsillectomy is a standard treatment commonly used. It can help reduce breathing problems, minimize behavioral issues, and also lower the risk of high blood pressure, full-blown sleep apnea, and other problems that may occur if the condition is left untreated. A recent NIH-supported clinical trial showed that for children with mild SDB, the surgery helped lower blood pressure and improve sleep and quality of life.

In the new study, researchers sought to determine whether adenotonsillectomy in comparison to watchful waiting (non-intervention) with supportive care is associated with fewer health care encounters and prescriptions. To find out, the researchers analyzed data from a randomized clinical trial that involved 459 children and adolescents with mild SDB who were recruited between 2016 and 2021 and followed for one year. The participants were ages 3 to 12 and were studied at seven academic sleep centers in the U.S.

During the trial, half the participants received an adenotonsillectomy, and the other half received supportive care without surgery, which included standardized education on healthy sleep and lifestyle and referral for untreated allergies or asthma. An analysis after the 12-month study period found 32% fewer health care encounters and 48% fewer prescriptions used among participants who underwent adenotonsillectomy, compared to those who did not undergo the surgery. For every 100 children, this equates to 125 fewer health care encounters and 253 fewer prescriptions - including for pain, skin, and respiratory medications - administered during the first year following surgery.

The reduced health care encounters included fewer office visits and outpatient procedures, particularly for sleep- and respiratory-related problems, but the mechanisms linking SDB treatment to health care outcomes are not clear.

More than 200 Venezuelans alleged by the White House to be gang members have been deported from the US to a supermax prison in El Salvador, even as a US judge blocked the removals.

El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele wrote on social media that 238 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua had arrived in the Central American country, along with 23 members of the international MS-13 gang, on Sunday morning.

Neither the US government nor El Salvador has identified the detainees, nor provided details of their alleged criminality or gang membership.

A federal judge's order prevented the Trump administration from invoking a centuries-old wartime law to justify some of the deportations, but the flights had already departed.

""Oopsie... Too late,"" posted Bukele on social media, referring to the judge's ruling.

A video attached to one of his posts shows lines of people with their hands and feet shackled being escorted by armed officials from the planes.

What is Tren de Aragua?

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied the court ruling had been violated.

""The administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order,"" she said.

""The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA [Tren de Aragua] aliens had already been removed from US territory.""

US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he had signed a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 as he accused Tren de Aragua of ""perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States"".

He said members of the gang would be deported for engaging in ""irregular warfare"" against the US.

The act - which was last used during World War Two to intern Japanese-American civilians - is a broad law that allows the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an ""enemy"" nation without the usual processes.

What is the 1798 law that Trump used to deport migrants?

On Saturday evening, US District Judge James Boasberg in Washington DC ordered a 14-day halt to deportations covered by Trump's proclamation, pending further legal arguments.

After lawyers told him that planes with deportees had already taken off, Judge Boasberg gave a verbal order for the flights to turn back, US media reported, although that directive did not form part of his written ruling.

The written notice appeared in the case docket at 19:25 EDT on Saturday (00:25 GMT on Sunday), the Reuters news agency reports, although it is unclear when the flights carrying the alleged gang members departed from the US.

In a court filing on Sunday, Department of Justice lawyers said the order had not applied because the deportees ""had already been removed from United States territory"".

A senior administration official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that 261 people were deported on Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties.

The justice department has appealed against the judge's ruling.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which was involved in the lawsuit against the Trump administration, said the court's order may have been violated.

The case raises constitutional questions since, under the US system of checks and balances, government agencies are expected to comply with a federal judge's ruling.

Venezuela criticised Trump invoking the Alien Enemies Act, saying it ""unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration"" and ""evokes the darkest episodes in the history of humanity, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps"".

Rights groups condemned Trump, accusing him of using a 227-year-old law to circumvent due process.

Amnesty International USA wrote on X that the deportations were ""yet another example of the Trump administration's racist targeting"" of Venezuelans ""based on sweeping claims of gang affiliation"".

President Bukele, a Trump ally, wrote that the detainees were immediately transferred to El Salvador's notorious mega-jail, the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot).

The El Salvadoran president said they would be held there ""for a period of one year"", and that could be ""renewable"".

El Salvador's Cecot jail is part of Bukele's effort to crack down on the country's organised crime.

The newly built maximum-security facility, which can hold up to 40,000 people, has been accused by human rights groups of mistreating inmates.

The arrangement between the US and El Salvador is a sign of strengthening diplomatic ties.

El Salvador was the second country that Rubio visited as the US's top diplomat.

During that trip, which took place in February, Bukele made an initial offer to take US deportees, saying it would help pay for the massive Cecot facility.

The latest deportations under Trump's second term are part of the president's long-running campaign against illegal immigration in the US.

In January, Trump signed an executive order declaring Tren de Aragua and MS-13 foreign terrorist organisations.

He won over voters on the campaign trail, in part, by promising to enact the largest deportation operation in US history.

While illegal border crossings have plummeted to the lowest number in decades since Trump took office, the Republican president has reportedly been frustrated by the relatively slow pace of deportations so far.","{'href': 'https://news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}"

This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

As the fifth anniversary of Covid-19 lockdowns approaches, bipartisan lawmakers and medical professionals across the country are rallying behind a bill that would address a growing crisis in the healthcare field.

Dr. Lorna Breen was chief of the ER department at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. Known by colleagues as a tireless worker who cared about patients and protocol, Breen committed suicide while on a short break in Virginia in the midst of the pandemic to get a break from the high-pressure world of emergency medical care.

A New York Times story quoted Breen's father as calling her death a ""casualty"" of the pandemic and said she had no history of mental illness, but had seemed ""detached"" as of late.

Proponents of the Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Reauthorization Act told Fox News Digital that the mental strain, burnout, and stress of working in a high-pressure, life-saving field demand stronger support systems.

A recent study from a North Carolina healthcare group showed that more than half of doctor-respondents said they wouldn't go into the primary care field if they could ""do it all over again.""

Read On The Fox News App

According to its proponents, the Lorna Breen Act provides billions of dollars in resources to help prevent suicide, burnout, and mental and behavioral health conditions among healthcare professionals.

Two longtime ER physicians who are leading the charge on the nongovernmental side of things spoke with Fox News Digital this week.

Dr. Randy Pilgrim – chief medical officer for SCP Health – and Dr. Bentley Tate, the emergency room company's chief wellness officer – both have decades of experience working in the high-pressure field and said that now, as the U.S. looks back at the COVID-19 pandemic, is the time to bring this issue to the fore.

SCP Health works across 35 states and is a leading voice on mental healthcare for physicians, they jointly said.

Doctor wellness must be a major priority, and is often overlooked, Pilgrim said, noting that patients come to doctors to better their own health, and that it is, rightly for the patient, a one-way street in that regard.

""Patients can't be faulted for the fact that when they come to their clinician, their physician or other clinician, they really are thinking mostly about their own health and how they can improve that,"" he said.

Americans Split On Covid 5 Years After The Pandemic

""For many, many centuries there has been this phrase ‘Physician, heal thyself', which is variably interpreted. But in the context of this, it means the healthier the doctor is, the more available they are for the patients themselves.""

""So, as mental health issues became more and more prevalent, more and more transparent, and more and more acknowledged that the stresses of the healthcare workforce are significant. It became very clear that destigmatizing that as well as providing resources to help, that was a very real phenomenon,"" Pilgrim added.

""Patients don't come to us saying, ‘Doctor, are you OK?' But at the end of the day, they want to know that we are [well] and it's our responsibility to be that way.""

Mental health strains on physicians were largely an ""underground phenomenon"" until COVID-19 put physicians' well-being into the forefront of the news.

During the pandemic, gurneys were rolled out in front of overburdened urban hospitals, and physicians, both rural and otherwise, were working long shifts, resulting in burnout and strain.

""Physician suicide is the far end and very unfortunate far end of that spectrum,"" Tate said.

Lingering Lung Disorders 5 Years After Covid

""But there are so many people who are frustrated, who are weary. And the reality is, we all lose when a physician retires ten years before they thought they were – or 10 years into their career, with so many years of training [goes and] transitions into where they're not seeing patients directly, but some other aspect of health care because they just got so frustrated or worn down or frankly, in a bad mental state.""

When doctors step away from patients for such personal reasons, the entire healthcare system loses, Tate said. When physicians are well and in the right frame of mind, patients benefit.

Pilgrim, who has also worked directly to push for Lorna Breen Act legislation, added that there is bipartisan acknowledgment that U.S. doctors need Congress' full support.

""At the end of the day, people realize this is about helping clinicians, but mainly so that they can help patients – But this is a patient-centered act. So, that's really easy to unify around,"" he said.

With the advent of DOGE scrutinizing every dollar the feds spend, there is also a new focus on how to pay for things like this act, Pilgrim added.

""People are looking for relatively small amounts of dollars that will have a relatively large and outsized impact,"" he said.

""And this actually is another thing that unifies congressmen and women is that this is a relatively small money in the grand scheme of things. And if you can impact just a single physician and make them him or her better, the hundreds to thousands of patients that benefit from that becomes an exponential impact.""

Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va. and Roger Marshall, R-Kan. – a doctor himself – are leading the Senate version of the bill, but did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who is joined by Reps. Jennifer Kiggans, R-Va., and Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., on the House version said Thursday that the act is truly bipartisan and that she will work hard to pass it so that ""doctors, nurses, physicians, and all healthcare providers can take care of themselves as they care for their patients.""

""Healthcare professionals dedicate their lives to serving their patients, often at the expense of their own physical and emotional well-being, and ensuring they have the resources to stay healthy is one of my top priorities,"" Dingell said.

Dax Shepard had a message for his listeners ahead of his podcast episode with Andrew Schulz.

“Today we have a guest that I've been following on Instagram for a couple years now,” Shepard, 50, said on the Monday, March 17, episode of the “Armchair Expert” podcast, before talking to cohost Monica Padman. “This is fun because you were on the fence about Andrew, about some of his comedy. And before he came, I said, ‘Come on in. We'd love to have you, but there'll be some pushback.' So this was a very unique and fun episode. You guys got to really hash it out.”



Shepard explained that this episode was “really political” despite the podcast typically trying to “avoid politics.”

“I was like, ‘There's no way we do this without going all in,'” Shepard recalled. “For me, it was very fun because we never do it. And also in the middle of it, I was like, ‘Yeah, this is why we never do it.' Because we're getting very granular about this policy or that and this year and whatever. But I thought it was thrilling to sit kind of on the sidelines and watch the whole thing.”

In the episode, Schulz's unfiltered humor was on full display. While discussing his new Netflix comedy special, Life, which addresses his journey to fatherhood with wife Emma, Padman asked Schulz about his joke about special needs children.

“I can say it because they're my embryos,” Schulz, 41, said of the R-word adding, “If I have r—— embryos, I can call them whatever I want. They're mine.”

Padman pointed out that Schulz doesn't have a child who has special needs, and could cross paths with an upset parent who saw the joke at his daughter's school.

When Padman asked whether he would “care” about a viewer being upset, Schulz replied, “Well it depends how they feel about it. If they see it and they're like, hey, that really hurt me and made me feel really uncomfortable. Then in that personal interaction, I'll feel bad that somebody was hurt by it, a person. … I don't feel bad about people telling me to feel bad on behalf of people that we don't even know if they feel bad.”

Elsewhere in the podcast, the trio began discussing trans rights.

“There's a thing that people don't say, which is, ‘Should they compete against [cis] women?' … No. But we can also say, ‘It sucks for them. That is so unfortunate that you're in that situation,'” Schulz said, to which Shepard replied, “Let's make a category. I actually am supportive of their right to compete, and I acknowledge that they're a woman. I want that right for them, but not at the expense of 20 other people.”

Schulz noted that “there's not even a room on Twitter for the little bit of empathy in the middle” when discussing these issues.

“So it seems so rigid and harsh, and we're getting things in 180 characters, or whatever the character limit is, there's room to be like, ‘Man it sucks as that person.' Because I do believe that there are trends with things. So I think that there are some young kids that are probably identifying as trans that might not actually be not only trans. … And then there are people who are trans. My guess is that competing in the Olympics is not even the top 100 of the things that those people care about. … And now they're the talking point of every show, and they're just out here going, ‘I'm just trying to be a barista at this thing and everybody who comes up wants to ask me if I should be a swimmer.' And you're like, ‘I don't give a f— about swimming.'”

For Schulz, he “loves” having conversations with people who share different views than him because his opinions “get sharper.”

“I'm like, ‘Oh, I'm hitting this too bluntly and I'm ostracizing all these people. I would do that with the trans athlete thing. I didn't have space for how much it must suck to be a trans person and not having anywhere to go, and just acknowledging that makes my opinion way more digestible.”

Schulz also addressed his friendship — or lack thereof — with Shepard's friend Jimmy Kimmel, whom he recalled was having a back-and-forth interaction with Aaron Rodgers. (Kimmel and Rodger's feud dates back to 2021, but was reignited in 2024 when the NFL player insinuated that the late night host should be worried about the names on Jeffrey Epstein's list. Kimmel slammed the allegations and threatened to take legal action. Rogers later said he wasn't “accusing” Kimmel of being on the list.)

“I felt like he started with jokes, and then Aaron had a joke, and then I think Jimmy got some real life circumstances that affected him. I think he got some death threats and that kind of s—,” Schulz explained. “There's a lot of crazy people out there. Then he made it not about jokes. I was like, ‘Yo, you opened the door with jokes.' He responded with jokes. And then you were like, ‘What you're doing is dangerous.'”

Schulz continued, “Jimmy is always someone who I've looked at and admired. He has iconic TV shows, comedy history. That to me, I felt a little let down. You clown this guy on national TV, on one of the biggest shows, he clipped you back. To me, I'm like, ‘That doesn't seem fair.'”

Schulz may not also have a fan in Shepard's wife, Kristen Bell. Shepard recalled the couple, who tied the knot in 2013, attending Schulz's show — and one joke that didn't land.

“I had Kristen on board, she was on the Andrew Schulz f—- train. And then this joke about abortion, you lost her,” Shepard recalled, to which Schulz replied, “Yeah, it wasn't a good joke. … It didn't have the silliness of the joke.”

Schulz explained that the idea behind the joke was “how many abortions is too many” for one person. “If it goes to, like, 20, I think that there has to be an intervention where it's like, ‘Alright, we gotta do something here.' The idea is the beginning of a joke. Making it silly is a joke,” Schulz said, to which Shepard explained Bell took issue with men not being included in the joke.

As they continued to discuss his controversial humor, Shepard said the first time he became “scared” for Schulz was during an alleged feud with Kendrick Lamar.

“He put out an album, and he had a line in it. He was like, ‘Don't ever let no white comedian talk about no black woman, that's law,'” Schulz said, claiming he “got confirmation” the line in Lamar's “Wacced Out Murals” was about him. “I didn't respond for weeks. I had to shoot my special, I didn't really care. That wasn't even the thing that bothered me about the line.”

Schulz continued, “The next line is, ‘And to the n—– that coon, the n—– that bein' groomed, slide on both of them.' … So slide is like assault or kill. I'm thinking, and the world is thinking, he's talking about Charlamagne and Alex Media, the two Black dudes that are on the show. So once you tell people to kill my friends, you get whatever I give you.”

Schulz noted that Lamar said a “stupid thing” to him, adding, “you don't tell your fans to kill two of my friends or slide or assault or whatever it is, even if it's not serious, you're putting that energy out there. So don't be surprised if you get some energy back.”

Schulz, who responded to the song, recalled people making the reply “racism so fast.” Schulz claimed that his response was “fair” after Lamar allegedly suggested for his “fans to kill my friends.”

“It's about as playful as a f— you, I'll kick your ass, that be done. But now I'm really worried about you because I'm like, ‘Well, he thinks that he's a rational person.' Kendrick is a national treasure. He's a Pulitzer Prize winning, couldn't be more talented or loved. And I'm going, ‘Bro, is this the fight you're going to pick? We gotta pick our battles. Is this the one?' You were fine.”

TLC is bringing light to a different type of family dynamic in its newest series Polyfamily — and Us Weekly as the exclusive first look at the show.

The new show, which premieres in April, focuses on two married couples, Sean and Taya and Tyler and Alysia, who happen to be dating each other's spouses.



“Taya's my wife and Alysia's my girlfriend,” Sean reveals in Us' sneak peek at the official trailer. Tyler chimes in, “And vice versa. Alysia's my wife and Taya's my girlfriend.”

Sean, who has been married to Taya for six years, explains, “We are a closed polyamorous quad. A closed quad is four people. We're only dating within ourselves and married within ourselves. We don't have any outside partners.”

Alysia, who has been married to Tyler for 11 years, confesses, “We never set out to live our lives like this, but we realized we could love more than one person and make our own rules as to what we want our family to look like.”

According to the family, Alysia and Tyler were parents to a son and daughter before they joined Sean and Taya's closed quad.

Since becoming a combined unit, the four adults have welcomed two more sons with one more baby on the way. (Alysia and Taya have both given birth to a son since the families began living together.)

“Since the guys switch rooms every night, we don't know who the fathers of the younger boys are,” Taya, who is pregnant with her second baby, reveals in the trailer.

Tyler notes that “we wonder sometimes” who the father of the younger children is, but admits, “Finding out could cause a lot of hurt.”

While the four adults entered their closed quad willingly, it is clear in the trailer that their unconventional setup isn't without its faults. For starters, Sean and Tyler aren't exactly pals.

“We live together, we have mutual partners and we parent together,” Sean tells the cameras of his relationship with Tyler. “But if we weren't in this situation, we probably wouldn't be friends.”

This season, fans will see the tension boil over between Sean and Tyler, especially when it comes to their kids.

“This has always been a point of contention. Your kids and then us,” Sean argues in the trailer. Tyler tries to shut him down, saying, “Dude, you don't need to parent me. I don't need that.” Sean the quips, “Maybe if I was parenting you, this s— wouldn't have happened.”

The women, meanwhile, have issues of their own to sort through. Alysia confesses in the trailer that she does get “jealous” over Taya and Tyler's romance, because she says “it almost looks like they're more in love than him and I.”

Taya, for her part, drops a bombshell on the group at the end of the trailer that could change their entire dynamic. “I have something to share. I feel like I have a connection with someone else,” she confesses, which throws off the group.

Tyler explains, “It's complicated to bring someone else in. We're not closed anymore at that point. We're just not.” Alysia confesses, “I don't know where we go from here.”

Polyfamily marks one of television's first series to depict a real-life quad dynamic. “In addition to the complex parenting dynamics, dating each other's partners is not without its share of emotional challenges,” TLC teased in a press release.

Polyfamily premieres on TLC Tuesday, April 29, at 10 p.m. ET.

The internet talks — and Rebecca Black has heard it all.

“I've heard just about everything,” Black, 27, exclusively told Us Weekly of the online rumors she has heard about herself. “When I was in high school and Tumblr was huge and all those anonymous forums were big, I remember there being a rumor … that I did coke off of a Book of Mormon.”



Black reiterated to Us that the rumor is “not true, to clarify if anyone's curious.”

“Not sure if that's fine to say,” she added. “But yeah, I've heard it all.”

Black — who is fresh off the release of her sophomore album SALVATION and the release of the music video for her single “TRUST!” — is no stranger to the entertainment business or the game artists often have to play to get recognized and remain relevant. After all, Black was just 13 when she released the music video for her viral song “Friday” in 2011, starting an online conversation that catapulted the singer into an overnight sensation.

“I mean, I think that the goal with anything that I make is just to start a conversation, whether it shocks people or not,” Black told Us. “I think if you watch the ‘TRUST!' video and maybe you haven't turned into what I've been up to for the last few years, maybe it would be shocking. But what I also love to see are people who have been around be like, ‘Nope, this has been going on. Makes sense. We're just pushing it to the next step.'”

She continued, “So I love to be part of that conversation and watch it go down and I'll continue to make what's exciting to me, regardless.”

In addition to releasing a new album, music video and starting even more online conversations — true or not — Black is also navigating life in the spotlight since coming out as queer in 2020.

“I just practice publicly,” Black told Us of her sexuality. “Not really a lot has changed [since coming out] other than I think I honestly felt — even before I came out, in the years that I was just being queer in my everyday life — a lot of my fans knew and my community was a lot smaller than maybe it is now.”

The singer added, “I think I have always had a really special relationship with all of the queer people in my life, regardless of my own [queerness]. I've always felt so grateful to the community for always accepting me before anyone else had.”

The “Friday” performer went on to explain that she now changes “the pronouns in my songs sometimes,” meaning she writes “with any pronoun.”

“I think my queerness has been something that has bred a lot of creativity,” Black explained. “But it's not the defining factor of what I want my music to be, either.”

SALVATION, Black's sophomore album, is out now.

The follow-up series to Buffy the Vampire Slayer may be here sooner than originally predicted, according to one of its key stars.

Sarah Michelle Gellar, who confirmed she will appear in a forthcoming reboot of the supernatural drama that attracted a legion of fans when it debuted in 1997, recently told People that the project is well and truly on its way.

“We've set up our offices, which means things are progressing probably faster than I'd anticipated,” Gellar, 47, told the outlet in an interview published Saturday, March 15. She did, however, add that “it's going to be a process” to ensure the return of her character, Buffy Summers, and the wider Buffy universe is perfected for a new generation of viewers.



“To do it the way it needs to be done, everyone has to be patient with all of us,” Gellar reminded fans. “This isn't something that [will just happen].”

Us Weekly confirmed in early February that producers in talks for a revival, just days before Gellar confirmed the news via Instagram. “So….. you might have heard some news this week, but I realize you haven't heard from me,” the actress wrote via the social media platform on February 7. “Three years ago, I got a call from my dear friend and mentor, Gail Berman. She told me that she wanted me to sit down with Chloé Zhao to hear her take on a potential ‘Buffy' revival.” (Zhao, 42, was the second woman in history to be awarded the Oscar for Best Director in 2021 for her work on Nomadland starring Frances McDormand.)

Gellar, who starred in Buffy until the show's finale in May 2003, continued, saying she “was blown away that Chloé even knew who I was.”

“I eventually agreed to go (mainly just to meet Chloé) and our twenty minute coffee quickly turned into a four hour adventure. We laughed, we cried, but mostly we both talked about how much this show means to us,” Gellar wrote. “I have always listened to the fans and heard your desire to revisit ‘Buffy' and her world, but it was not something I could do unless I was sure we would get it right.”

Gellar, who worked alongside Alyson Hannigan, David Boreanaz, Nicholas Brendon, Charisma Carpenter, Anthony Head and the late Michelle Trachtenberg on Buffy, admitted last month that she initially felt overwhelmed by the reboot getting the green light.

“It's heartwarming and exciting and also incredibly nerve-wracking at the same time,” the actress, who is married to Freddie Prinze Jr., told People on February 15. Her mixed feelings were revealed amid news that the Buffy reboot would feature a new lead character and Gellar would return in a recurring role, per Variety, who was one of the first outlets to report on the reboot's confirmation.

Gellar will serve as an executive producer alongside original Buffy EPs Berman, Fran Kuzui and Kaz Kuzui via Suite B. Dolly Parton is also set to be an executive producer on the pilot after her Sandollar company was part of the original project. (Hulu and 20th Television had no comment on the news.)

Original Buffy creator Joss Whedon is not involved in the refreshed series, according to Deadline.

The White Lotus committed to the incest bit, but what happens between Sam Nivola and Patrick Schwarzenegger‘s characters from here?

During the Sunday, March 16, episode of the hit HBO series, Lochlan (Nivola) and Saxon (Schwarzenegger) party with Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood) — but that quickly takes a turn when they finally act on that concerning tension between them by sharing a kiss.

“Without spoiling too much, everything changes for my character. It was basically like there's two versions of me. There's before that and after that, and that was a really important thing,” Nivola, 21, told GQ on Sunday. “Of course, the way it's edited and the way it looks, it is really sort of raunchy and there's moments leading up to that are really sexually charged. But I think really that's supposed to be a red herring for the audience where really it's just [that] Lochlan just wants attention and he just wants his brother to like him.”

Nivola acknowledged that Lochlan “gets really f—ed up and does something terrible” as a result.



“We didn't really talk about it at all until we shot the scene. My character's big turning point is that moment at the end of episode 5,” he continued. “We shot it a few different ways, and we talked about it a lot. I think at the end of the day, it was supposed to just be like they're all really f—ed up, and, of course, kissing your brother is incredibly wrong and weird and gross. But I think as is the case with The White Lotus, it's like these crazy actions and sort of heightened reality coming from really real emotions that are actually really relatable to your everyday guy.”

Before the show acted on the weird vibes between the brothers, Lochlan and Saxon's relationship was already called into question. Saxon notably asked Lochlan about his porn preferences just before he walked around naked in front of his younger brother. Lochlan, for his part, appeared intrigued by Saxon's advice while seemingly questioning his sexual identity.

“He just is desperate for his brother's approval, and he's out doing this partying drug thing with Saxon, which is a thing that Saxon keeps talking about, and all he talks about is sex. He's like, ‘Sex is the main point of life. You need to get laid. That's what you need,'” Nivola explained. “I'm like, ‘OK. Well, in this charged sexual environment, what can I do to make you notice me and get you to approve of me?' And then, he does the wrong thing to make that happen.”

Nivola called the moment “really complicated” for his character going forward.

“What we wound up deciding is we're going to let our instincts and [creator] Mike [White]‘s direction take the reins and let the audience interpret this weird thing that we have going on, because that's the way of movies and TV,” he detailed. “And also, the way Mike directs is very loose, which I love. He never comes into a day of work like, ‘This is exactly what I want, and if I don't get that, I'm going to be mad.'”

Nivola continued: “He's always coming up with ideas. So you as the actor have to really be yourself, not married to anything. You have to be ready to adapt and change your performance depending on what he winds up choosing on the day. So we also didn't want to make any hard and fast decisions about what we wanted the dynamic to be until we were on set.”

While Nivola couldn't give away where the story goes next, he was grateful for the chance to bring Lochlan to life, saying, “He's actually pretty similar to a lot of characters I've played. He's obviously awkward and virginal and young. It's definitely in my wheelhouse. … Basically Lochlan is a really, really insecure guy who is stuck between his siblings and just wants to be loved and will do anything to achieve that. I really relate to that. I mean, maybe not as desperately as him, but I think it's a very, very universal experience.”

New episodes of The White Lotus air on HBO Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

Patrick Schwarzenegger is unpacking that kiss that went down in episode five of The White Lotus season 3.

Spoilers ahead if you haven't watched!

After the Full Moon Party, Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) and Chelsea (Aimee Lou Wood), along with brothers Saxon (Schwarzenegger) and Lochlan (Sam Nivola), hang out on Greg's yacht. At one point, Saxon tells the women to kiss, and then they expect the brothers to do the same. After Saxon and Lochy share a little peck, Lochlan goes in for a much longer kiss, which appears to disorient and confuse Saxon.

Keep reading to find out what Patrick said about the moment and how it impacts the remainder of the season...

Of episode five, Patrick said that is where “everything starts to unravel.”

He then said Mike White, the show's creator, purposely wants the audience to try and figure out that kiss.

Patrick told Today, “He wants to leave that up to the interpretation of the audience of what is happening. Was a power shift happening? Is there a different power dynamic between him and Lochy? Is Lochy coming on to him? Is it the drugs? Is it the girls pressuring him? What is it? So, I think he leaves that open-ended for the audience to try to decipher.”

Of his character's remaining arc this season, Patrick added, ""One of the themes really is you enter the White Lotus as one person and you leave as another. Who are you when everything that you thought you were is taken away? And I think that's something that's really relevant and prevalent for for Saxon. Him walking into the White Lotus as the most confident and sure person of who he is, and everything gets completely questioned in his experience there.""

Find out if The White Lotus is canceled or renewed for another season.

Michelle Monaghan is opening up about getting into character for The White Lotus!

On Saturday (March 15), the 48-year-old actress marked the halfway point in season 3 of the hit HBO series and revealed why she ditched her signature brunette hair for a blonde look to play Jaclyn Lemon.

Keep reading to find out more…“We're midway thru @thewhitelotus season three so it's about that time to talk all things #JaclynLemon glam! 🤩 Michelle wrote on Instagram. “Well we all know it takes a village with a lot of talent and inspiration.”

She then revealed that White Lotus creator Mike White is the reason why she went blonde and praised celeb hair colorist Tracey Cunningham for her achieve the look.

“When I first booked the gig, Mike White asked me if I would go blonde. Uh…YES! I'd shave my head for that man! Mike wanted the ladies to be ‘a big blonde blob,'” Michelle explained. “He wanted us to convey the look of sameness – an interchangeable trio of sorts prior to discovering the nuances of each character as the season progresses. Going blonde was wonderful creative inspiration for me but I'd need an epic colorist to make those locks a reality. Enter the queen @traceycunningham1 (thanks for the intro @mslesliebibb 😙)”

She added, “I easily deferred to Tracey's expertise. She and her incredible assistants meticulously perfected the color over the course of a few eight hour sessions. Moreover, Tracey maintained the color and the roots the entire six months we were in Thailand, making multiple trips to keep that mane oh so Jaclyn (and oh so healthy – thank you @olaplex). I'm so thankful to her, and her team, because let's be honest, blondes absolutely do have more fun.”

New episodes of The White Lotus air on Sunday nights at 9pm ET on HBO and are available for streaming on MAX.

SPOILER ALERT - Do not read ahead if you haven't watched the new episode of The White Lotus!

Weeks after Ke Huy Quan made a voice cameo, another Oscar winner is making a surprise appearance on The White Lotus!

HBO released episode 5 of season 3 of the Emmy-winning series on Sunday night (March 16) and during the episode, a famous actor made an appearance as an old friend of Walton Goggins' character Rick.

Keep reading to find out more...As viewers recall, Rick is in Bangkok looking for the man who killed his father, who turns out to the owner of the White Lotus.

Rick meets up with an old friend who turns out to be Sam Rockwell!

Sam's character evidently owes Rick a favor, but he's now sober and found religion, so he's not interested in getting drunk with Rick.

“I also wanted to bring you what you asked for,” Sam's character said, as he slid a duffel bag to Rick's feet. “Hope you don't have to use that.""

He then went on to explain why he's in Thailand.

“I took the partying thing as far as it could go,” Sam's character said.

“I moved here because I had to leave the States but I picked Thailand because I always had a thing for Asian girls and when I got here I was like a kid in a candy store. I got money, no attachments, nothing to do,"" he continued. ""I started partying. It got wild, I was picking up girls every night, always different ones, petite ones, chubby ones, older ones, sometimes multiple ladies a night. I was out of control, I became insatiable and after about a thousand nights like I started to lose it. I started wondering where am I going with this. Why do I feel the need to f--k all of these women. What is desire?”

He then goes on to explain to Rick that he decided to let men have sex with him so that he can feel like ""one of these Asian girls.""

“We all have our Achilles heel. Why are some of us attracted to the opposite form? Sex is a poetic act, it's a metaphor,"" Sam's character continued. ""Then I realized I gotta stop. I got into Buddism, which is all about spirit versus form, detaching from self, getting off the never-ending carousel of lust and suffering. Being sober isn't so hard, being celibate that's tough.""

If you were unaware, Sam's real-life partner Leslie Bibb also stars on season 3 of The White Lotus playing Kate.

New episodes of The White Lotus air on Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.

Wendy Williams flashed a smile while out and about in New York City on Saturday evening.

Williams, 60, was seen heading to dinner at Tucci, an Italian eatery in the NoHo district of Manhattan. The talk show host, who suffers from Graves disease and lymphedema, used a mobility scooter to maneuver through city streets.

Williams' appearance outside of her assisted living facility comes after a whirlwind week for the television star, who was not only hospitalized for an evaluation after receiving a welfare check, but also claimed on ""The View"" Friday that she wasn't incapacitated and wanted to terminate her years-long guardianship.

Williams sported a royal blue Dior monogrammed coat with furry cuffs, black leggings and a pair of black Chanel boots for dinner.

""I needed a breath of fresh air. I needed to see the doctor, so that's why I went to the hospital,"" she said. ""It was my choice to get an independent evaluation on my incapacitation, which I don't have it. How dare they say I have incapacitation. I do not.""

Wendy Williams Says She Passed Competency Test With ‘Flying Colors' After Being Rushed To Hospital

Williams was taken to the hospital after officials responded to a 911 call from her care facility.

""On Monday, March 10, 2025, the NYPD responded to a welfare check at 505 West 35 Street,"" the New York Police Department said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

""EMS responded and transported a 60-year-old female to an area hospital for evaluation.""

Williams had thrown a handwritten note that read ""Help! Wendy!!"" out the window, according to the New York Post.

One day after being rushed to the hospital, Williams spoke with Rosanna Scotto on a live segment of ""Good Day New York"" to discuss the outcome of her competency tests. She claimed she passed the tests with ""flying colors.""

""Everybody knows factually that Wendy is not incapacitated,"" Ginalisa Monterrosa, a caretaker for Williams, told Scotto.

During an appearance on ""The Breakfast Club"" that same morning, Williams further explained why she pleaded to go to a medical facility and get evaluated by an independent doctor.

""The police showed up. I'm exhausted. I wanted to go to the hospital to talk to the doctor,"" Williams said.

The former radio queen discussed her guardianship case on ""The View,"" and told the women, ""I need them … to get off my neck. I can't do it with these two people again.""

She admitted she didn't want a guardian anymore. ""It's been over three years, it's time for my money and my life to get back to status quo,"" Williams said. ""At this point in my life, I want to terminate the guardianship and move on with my life, if that's possible at all.""

In February 2024, the former talk show host's team announced she'd been diagnosed with both progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

""Over the past few years, questions have been raised at times about Wendy's ability to process information and many have speculated about Wendy's condition, particularly when she began to lose words, act erratically at times, and have difficulty understanding financial transactions,"" the statement said.

""In 2023, after undergoing a battery of medical tests, Williams was officially diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Aphasia, a condition affecting language and communication abilities, and frontotemporal dementia, a progressive disorder impacting behavior and cognitive functions, have already presented significant hurdles in Wendy's life.""

The Busia Chapter Civil Society Organisations (CSO) Network has expressed fears on what it terms as lack of accountability and transparency in dispensing the FLLoCA project funds across the county.

The human watch groups are now accusing the Busia county government leadership manning the World Bank funded  FLLoCA projects, saying the finance managers are keeping financial matters of the projects close to their chests. They called on the leadership of these funds to ensure transparency noting that this is public money and its details should as well be public.

Speaking during a one week sensitization forum for Busia CSOs network organised by FLLoCA national steering Committee office at the Community Empowerment and Development Centre in Busia county, the network members reiterated their dissatisfaction in the manner FLLoCA funds are being utilised to beat the logic of value for money.

“We are here today in Busia to train and equip CSOs in Busia with knowledge and understanding of FLLoCA funding” remarked Robert Banda, a member of FLLoCA national steering Committee.

Banda disclosed that in some areas, county governments have diverted FLLoCA funds into different projects outside FLLoCA framework. “We are privy to the fact that county leadership divert FLLoCA funds to projects not aligned to FLLoCA framework and that is why we are carrying out financial Social Audit against the projects initiated,” said Banda.

According to documents seen by Africa ScienceNews, Busia County received Kshs. 219m   Climate change Resilient fund during 2023/2024 financial year, and it is between this financial period that the Auditor General has raised an audit query on procurement and other expenditure procedures.

Dr Bonface Erute is the member of County Assembly of Busia representing Amukura West ward and has confirmed that indeed there is an audit query which require answers.

He has, however, assured Civil Society Organisations of investigating the matter for further action.

Addressing the press after day one sessions, the CSOs led by their Busia  representative at the national steering Committee Paulin Saris said there is no value for money in the FLLoCA funded projects in the border county of Busia. “Yes, a total of 23 projects have been initiated in the county, some completed, some ongoing but we are not satisfied with the monetary value for the projects” disclosed Saris.

She at the same time noted that access to information on FLLoCA funded projects from the county leadership is not easy as it should.

Francis Namuju, Director Community Empowerment and Development Centre registered his disappointment in the manner projects are allocated. He disclosed that out of ongoing projects, Budalangi subcounty was allocated Nil project, raising suspicion in distribution of the projects for respective regions.

“Allocation of FLLoCA projects in Busia are skewed towards one region guided by political machinations and putting principle of equity in limbo,” noted Namuju.

Namuju wondered why Budalangi region was skipped in project allocation whereas it is the most hit area with climate change phenomenon.

He pointed out that local committees at the grassroot level lack the knowledge and technical requisite to steer FLLoCA projects to higher levels, sentiment echoed by a representative of people living with disability who cast doubt on the Competence of the grassroot committees to discharge their mandate satisfactorily according to guidelines of FLLoCA.

She called on the county government of Busia to be transparent, capacity build the locals on matters FLLoCA. “The grassroot people who are the primary beneficiaries of FLLoCA projects have no knowledge or idea  of what FLLoCA is and which projects are funded by FLLoCA,” she claimed.

Financing locally led climate change activities is an idea whose priority is to mitigate against impacts of climate change at the grassroot level, but in Busia there is more than meet the eye as so far as FLLoCA initiative is concerned and now the Civil Society Organisations in Busia are calling for transparency and collaborative approach to ensure success of these funds.

Expectant mothers in Busia County have received a significant boost in maternal healthcare following the donation of five ultrasound machines by Rainbow 4 Africa UK. The machines, valued at over Ksh 5 million, were distributed to Angurai, Port Victoria, Nangina, Matayos, and Sio-Port Sub-County Hospitals.

The donation aims to enhance early screening and detection of pregnancy complications, improving maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The machines will help monitor fetal development and enable expectant mothers to access essential services closer to home.

Speaking during the handover ceremony at Matayos Sub-County Hospital, Busia Deputy Governor and County Executive Committee Member (CECM) for Health, H.E. Arthur Odera, expressed gratitude for the support. He emphasized that the equipment would help reduce maternal and neonatal deaths caused by undetected pregnancy complications.

Dr. Frank Wanyama, leading the Rainbow 4 Africa UK Kenya delegation, reaffirmed the organization's commitment to strengthening healthcare in underserved areas. He highlighted the alarming rates of maternal and neonatal deaths in Busia and noted that this intervention aims to curb the crisis.

“The statistics of maternal and neonatal deaths due to undetected pregnancy complications are concerning. Rainbow 4 Africa UK is stepping in to help address this issue,” said Dr. Wanyama.

With this latest donation, Rainbow 4 Africa UK has now supplied a total of five ultrasound machines to hospitals in Busia County. Local healthcare workers welcomed the initiative, noting that expectant mothers previously had to travel long distances for ultrasound services.

To ensure the sustainability of the initiative, the County Health Department has committed to training healthcare personnel on the proper use and maintenance of the machines. This effort will enhance service delivery and contribute to improved maternal healthcare in the region.

Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins joins 'Fox & Friends' to praise President Donald Trump's 'generational change' and questions whether the government has utilized resources 'wisely.'

Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Doug Collins clapped back at critics he accused of circulating ""fake news"" about the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts inordinately affecting veterans' care.

Collins, who remains an active colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserves, announced his agency is opening what will be a fourth new VA clinic in the few months he has been in office.

""As government union bosses, the legacy media and some in Congress have been spreading false rumors of health care and benefits cuts at VA, we've opened multiple brand-new clinics that will serve tens of thousands of veterans,"" Collins said in a statement.

""Don't believe the fake news.""

VA SEC ACCUSES REPORTER OF SPREADING RUMORS ABOUT DOGE HURTING VETERANS

On Friday, the VA opened a new clinic in Hamilton, Montana, marking the fourth such ribbon-cutting since President Donald Trump took office just under two months ago.

Previously, Collins oversaw the establishment of a new clinic in fast-growing Spotsylvania, Virginia, – between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia, – as well as in Aurora, Colorado, and Ridgewood, Queens, in New York City.

A Montana VA official told Montana Public Radio last week that Collins had been clear that there would be ""no cuts"" to services despite DOGE attempting to take an ax to the bureaucracy – and with it many VA employees.

The 8,000-square-foot facility is 600% larger than a prior, now-defunct clinic in the area.

Meanwhile, the new Spotsylvania facility is primed to be the largest of its kind in the country, according to Fredericksburg-area media. 

FORT BRAGG IS BACK

An estimated 35,000 patients can be seen each year at the new site, located where Interstate 95 and US-1 diverge just south of the city.

While the VA is primed to cut 15% of its workforce via DOGE's efforts – from 471,000 to 398,000 – Collins reiterated to Fox News that there will be no interruption or decline in services or care quality.

Collins responded to a warning from Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who said that such cuts would hurt service to veterans and that the thought it is a ""bad idea"" should be a ""bipartisan"" admonition.

Citing the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the secretary said all parties should at least agree that the VA has seen its services at ""high risk"" for waste, fraud, abuse and insufficient care.

""I've been here four weeks, but it's interesting that there's no solutions being proposed,"" Collins told ""Fox & Friends"" last week.

""President Trump brought generational change to DC. And he's saying let's look at everything. So what we're looking at is, if our system is on a high risk list, if we've had issues and all that the government has decided to do lately has put money or people at something, then maybe we need to ask the better question -- are we using our resources wisely and making sure that our department is taking care of the veteran, which is our only responsibility?""

Other liberals have lambasted the administration over proposed cuts to VA staff, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., ranking member of the Senate Health Committee.

""They're going to gut the Department of Veterans Affairs, jeopardizing the health and well-being of millions of veterans,"" Sanders recently claimed.

One Democratic veteran in Congress, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, said he regularly visits the VA on a personal level and sees waiting lists and knows how troublesome the process can be.

""All of that is going to get worse,"" Moulton told MSNBC.

Collins said Trump set a goal for reduction-in-force, and that Democrats do not understand that the projected staff figures are part of a ""deliberative process that's going to take some time.""

""That's going to include career VA employees. It's going to include senior executives,"" he said.

Collins said the GAO has had the VA on its high-risk list for a decade, but only now are Democrats in Congress ""yelling ‘don't do anything.'""

Of the layoffs thus far, Collins said the proportion has been less than 1% of the agency's workforce and has not really affected front-facing personnel.

He also said that $980 million in contract-related spending is being scrutinized in an attempt to instead reinvest it in patient care, as part of DOGE's work.

Additionally, on Monday, the VA announced it is phasing-out treatment for ""gender dysphoria"" – which had been supported by the Biden administration.

""Effective immediately, VA will not offer cross-sex hormone therapy to veterans who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria, unless"" they are in the midst of receiving such care, the agency said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.

, Contributor. 

Is Bernie Sanders back? Earlier this month, the Associated Press proclaimed that Sanders has emerged as one of the leaders of a revived ""anti-Trump resistance."" The 83-year-old senator is touring the country, ""drawing huge crowds"" who come to hear him talk about democracy, education, and health care.

To be fair, the Vermont socialist hasn't really gone anywhere. But after his insurgent presidential campaign in 2016, he has mostly retreated to his role as one of the Senate's most senior members—most recently, as co-chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee during the Biden administration.

Sanders has long been the most prominent proponent of adopting Canadian-style socialized health care in the United States. One could even call him the ""Pied Piper"" of single payer. Abolishing private insurance and replacing it with a government-run, single-payer system was a tentpole of his presidential campaigns—and has remained his cause célèbre ever since.

But single-payer health care is nothing but folly. Canada's system taxes people heavily for the ""privilege"" of waiting forever for low-quality care. It leaves doctors and nurses overworked and burnt out—and prevents sick Canadians from accessing cutting-edge treatments and timely appointments.

It would be a disaster to let single-payer cross the border.

The appeal of government-guaranteed health coverage is simple—every person, no matter their income level or employment status, has insurance that promises them any medical procedure they need, on demand, free of charge.

But that's not at all how it works. We can begin by dispensing with the idea that single-payer health care is ""free.""

People may not have to pay out of pocket at the hospital or doctor's office for care, nor do they have to send monthly premiums to an insurance company. But they do face steep taxes to fund their health insurance. Last year, the typical Canadian family of four paid $18,000 in hidden taxes for health care, according to the Fraser Institute. That's up over 85% since 1997.

Those taxes do not buy top-quality care. Consider the disparity in outcomes for cancer patients. Canada has 197 cancer deaths per 100,000 people, compared to 183 per 100,000 in the United States.

This disparity is due in part to the fact that Canada's healthcare system—like all single-payer systems—keeps costs low by restricting the supply of care.

Canada has just 14 CT scanners for every million residents, while the United States has 42 per million. Things are even worse when it comes to cutting-edge drugs. As of October 2022, American patients had access to 85% of all drugs launched between 2012 and 2021. Canadians had access to just 45% of the drugs launched in that same period.

Cutting-edge medicines are hardly the only things Canadian patients have to wait for. According to the Fraser Institute, Canadian patients faced a median wait of 30 weeks in 2024 for treatment from a specialist following referral by a general practitioner. That was up from just over 27 weeks in 2023—and is a 222% increase from 1993.

Because care is free at the point of service, demand is unlimited. Supply is necessarily finite—and made more so by the government's artificial caps on health spending. Shortages and long waits are the necessary result.

All that waiting has a real human cost. In the first six months of 2024, St. Paul's hospital in British Columbia canceled over 100 cardiac surgeries because of staff shortages. It's no wonder that around 75% of Canadians believe their country's healthcare system is in crisis.

Still, Canadian politicians can't see what their constituents have been forced to understand. Newly-elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney came out of the gate defending Canada's single-payer system, saying ''In America health care is big business. In Canada it is a right.""

But what good is a right to health care when it means patients are left waiting around for treatment that may never come? As former Canadian Supreme Court Chief Justice Madame Beverley McLachlin wrote in a case challenging the government's monopoly on the provision of insurance coverage, ""Access to a waiting list is not access to health care.""

She was spot on. Americans who pine for Medicare for All in the United States should take note of their Canadian peers waiting—and dying—in line for care.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"

While nursing home residents suffer from pain, anxiety, and other distressing symptoms, they are unable to communicate their discomfort due to cognitive impairments.

With electronic health records often lacking structured data on these symptoms, healthcare providers are struggling to deliver timely and appropriate palliative care.

A study from the Utilizing Palliative Leaders in Facilities to Transform care for people with Alzheimer's Disease research team, or UPLIFT-AD, led by Dr. Kathleen Unroe and Dr. John Cagle, seeks to address this gap by revamping an existing symptom assessment tool to improve the detection and management of distress in non-verbal patients.

The UPLIFT-AD study validated an enhanced symptom assessment tool to more accurately capture pain, anxiety, and well-being indicators among nursing home residents with moderate to severe dementia.

Originally designed for post-mortem symptom reporting by family members, the adapted tool allows nursing home staff and families to report real-time observations of living residents, making it a valuable resource for guiding palliative care interventions.

Unroe, a research scientist at the Indiana University Center for Aging Research at Regenstrief Institute, told Healthcare IT News there is a critical role of standardized assessments in this process.

""Standardized assessments, relying on observation of clinical staff, do exist for people with cognitive impairment,"" she said. ""This observational data can be captured in standard clinician assessment notes.""

However, ensuring that this data is consistently integrated into EHRs remains a challenge.

One of the key issues in symptom tracking for cognitively impaired residents is the lack of structured integration within EHR systems.

While some may assume artificial intelligence or machine learning could help automate symptom detection, Unroe points out that the priority is simply ensuring that symptom assessment data makes it into EHRs in a systematic and accessible way.

""The first step is to get symptom assessment data into EHRs, by integrating assessments, and documentation of assessments, into clinical workflows,"" she said

Rather than a technical limitation, integrating these assessments into existing EHRs is largely a matter of workflow optimization and staff training.

Nursing home clinicians must be equipped to document symptoms consistently, and IT systems must support seamless entry and retrieval of this critical data.

Improving palliative care in nursing homes also requires better coordination between different healthcare providers.

Nursing homes often operate in isolation, making it difficult for hospitals and specialists to access symptom records when residents are transferred or require additional care.

Unroe explained participation in health information exchanges could bridge this gap.

""Participation of nursing homes in health information exchanges and direct data exchanges, such as via portals, with hospitals is critical to ensure safer transitions of care,"" she said.

By linking nursing home EHRs with broader healthcare networks, clinicians can make more informed decisions about symptom management and palliative care interventions.

Looking ahead, healthcare IT solutions could play a crucial role in streamlining palliative care referrals and improving symptom tracking, with automation as a potential game-changer.

By integrating automated screening tools within EHR systems, nursing homes could proactively identify residents in need of specialized palliative care, ensuring that appropriate consultations and interventions are initiated in a timely manner.

""Automated identification of patients likely to benefit from palliative care, and the ability to generate lists of patients appropriate for referral, can take the burden of that process off of nursing home staff,"" Unroe explained.

The current wave of generative AI has captured public imagination, but we must temper our expectations. While these models demonstrate impressive capabilities in processing vast amounts of medical literature and generating coherent text, they're far from perfect.

As two people who have spent careers at the intersection of healthcare delivery and innovation, we have both watched the AI revolution unfold with both excitement and concern. While artificial intelligence promises to transform healthcare, however, we must separate reality from hype to harness its true potential.

Let's be clear: AI in healthcare didn't start with ChatGPT. For decades, healthcare organizations have been using machine learning and pattern recognition to assist medical professionals. In the mid-1990s, we saw AI applications in pathology for cancer detection. These weren't replacements for physicians but rather tools to enhance their capabilities.

This fundamental philosophy remains crucial today: AI should augment, not replace, healthcare professionals.


					Patient expectations continue to evolve, and healthcare practices that fail to adapt risk more than just revenue—they risk losing trust.				

The current wave of generative AI has captured public imagination, but we must temper our expectations. While these models demonstrate impressive capabilities in processing vast amounts of medical literature and generating coherent text, they're far from perfect. 

Indeed, current large language models have error rates between 15% and 40% — which is far from acceptable when lives are at stake.

What patient would trust a physician who offered the right information 70% of the time?

When summarizing clinical trials, analyzing patient-physician conversations, or making treatment recommendations, we cannot afford hallucinations or inconsistencies.


					Balancing healthcare benefits and insurance costs requires research. From becoming a Difference Card member to offering wellness resources, there are many ways to improve healthcare at low cost.				

But this doesn't mean we should dismiss AI's potential; rather, we must be strategic as an industry about where and how we deploy it. What Roth and others have pointed out is that generative AI models may not ever be great at medical reasoning, but they can indeed be good at identifying key factors that should go into decision-making.

As a result, the real promise of AI in healthcare lies in its ability to support human decision-making, not replace it. These tools can digest massive amounts of medical literature, analyze patient records, and identify patterns that might escape even the most experienced clinicians.

The key is building reliable decision-support systems on top of these foundation models; systems that combine AI's pattern-recognition capabilities with rigorous clinical validation and human oversight.

Across many organizations in healthcare, including those with which we have firsthand experience, there have been explorations in targeted applications where AI can enhance specific healthcare processes. We've learned that while large language models offer impressive general capabilities, specialized models focused on specific tasks often provide better results, and they can do it faster than general purpose models.

Critically, such targeted applications can also yield such results at a fraction of the cost, when analyzing electronic health records for specific conditions or medications.

This practical approach to AI adoption reflects a broader truth: healthcare innovation isn't about chasing the latest technology trend – it's about finding sustainable solutions to real problems. As healthcare leaders, we must focus on applications that demonstrably improve patient outcomes, support our healthcare workers, protect patient privacy, and maintain cost-effectiveness.

The path forward requires a balanced approach that takes all of the above factors into careful consideration. We should leverage AI's capabilities to handle routine tasks, analyze complex medical data, and support clinical decision-making, all while maintaining high standards for accuracy and reliability. Success in healthcare AI will depend on our ability to match the right technology to the right challenge.

But we need to resist the temptation to view AI as a magical solution to all healthcare problems, and to lavish our attention and resources on one-size-fits-all technologies, or those that support autonomous AI decision-making. 

The future of healthcare isn't about AI taking over; it's about creating a symbiotic relationship between human expertise and artificial intelligence. By maintaining this perspective, we can harness AI's potential while avoiding its pitfalls, ultimately creating a healthcare system that better serves both patients and providers.

But to get there we must ignore the hype, and we must not let ourselves be fooled by fluency. As any physician could tell you, there's a universe of difference between a brilliant med student and a competent clinician. We'll do well by patients and clinicians to bear this difference in mind as we harness AI's power to benefit all.

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, enabling machines to understand and generate human-like text with remarkable accuracy. However, despite their impressive language capabilities, LLMs are inherently limited by the data they were trained on. Their knowledge is static and confined to the information they were trained on, which becomes problematic when dealing with dynamic and constantly evolving domains like healthcare.

The healthcare industry is a complex, ever-changing landscape with a vast and rapidly growing body of knowledge. Medical research, clinical practices, and treatment guidelines are constantly being updated, rendering even the most advanced LLMs quickly outdated. Additionally, patient data, including electronic health records (EHRs), diagnostic reports, and medical histories, are highly personalized and unique to each individual. Relying solely on an LLM's pre-trained knowledge is insufficient for providing accurate and personalized healthcare recommendations.

Furthermore, healthcare decisions often require integrating information from multiple sources, such as medical literature, clinical databases, and patient records. LLMs lack the ability to seamlessly access and synthesize data from these diverse and distributed sources. This limits their potential to provide comprehensive and well-informed insights for healthcare applications.

Overcoming these challenges is crucial for using the full potential of LLMs in the healthcare domain. Patients, healthcare providers, and researchers require intelligent agents that can provide up-to-date, personalized, and context-aware support, drawing from the latest medical knowledge and individual patient data.

Enter LLM function calling, a powerful capability that addresses these challenges by allowing LLMs to interact with external functions or APIs, enabling them to access and use additional data sources or computational capabilities beyond their pre-trained knowledge. By combining the language understanding and generation abilities of LLMs with external data sources and services, LLM function calling opens up a world of possibilities for intelligent healthcare agents.

In this blog post, we will explore how Mistral LLM on Amazon Bedrock can address these challenges and enable the development of intelligent healthcare agents with LLM function calling capabilities, while maintaining robust data security and privacy through Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.

Healthcare agents equipped with LLM function calling can serve as intelligent assistants for various stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and researchers. They can assist patients by answering medical questions, interpreting test results, and providing personalized health advice based on their medical history and current conditions. For healthcare providers, these agents can help with tasks such as summarizing patient records, suggesting potential diagnoses or treatment plans, and staying up to date with the latest medical research. Additionally, researchers can use LLM function calling to analyze vast amounts of scientific literature, identify patterns and insights, and accelerate discoveries in areas such as drug development or disease prevention.

LLM function calling offers several advantages for enterprise applications, including enhanced decision-making, improved efficiency, personalized experiences, and scalability. By combining the language understanding capabilities of LLMs with external data sources and computational resources, enterprises can make more informed and data-driven decisions, automate and streamline various tasks, provide tailored recommendations and experiences for individual users or customers, and handle large volumes of data and process multiple requests concurrently.

Potential use cases for LLM function calling in the healthcare domain include patient triage, medical question answering, and personalized treatment recommendations. LLM-powered agents can assist in triaging patients by analyzing their symptoms, medical history, and risk factors, and providing initial assessments or recommendations for seeking appropriate care. Patients and healthcare providers can receive accurate and up-to-date answers to medical questions by using LLMs' ability to understand natural language queries and access relevant medical knowledge from various data sources. Additionally, by integrating with electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical decision support systems, LLM function calling can provide personalized treatment recommendations tailored to individual patients' medical histories, conditions, and preferences.

Amazon Bedrock supports a variety of foundation models. In this post, we will be exploring how to perform function calling using Mistral from Amazon Bedrock. Mistral supports function calling, which allows agents to invoke external functions or APIs from within a conversation flow. This capability enables agents to retrieve data, perform calculations, or use external services to enhance their conversational abilities. Function calling in Mistral is achieved through the use of specific function call blocks that define the external function to be invoked and handle the response or output.

LLM function calling typically involves integrating an LLM model with an external API or function that provides access to additional data sources or computational capabilities. The LLM model acts as an interface, processing natural language inputs and generating responses based on its pre-trained knowledge and the information obtained from the external functions or APIs. The architecture typically consists of the LLM model, a function or API integration layer, and external data sources and services.

Healthcare agents can integrate LLM models and call external functions or APIs through a series of steps: natural language input processing, self-correction, chain of thought, function or API calling through an integration layer, data integration and processing, and persona adoption. The agent receives natural language input, processes it through the LLM model, calls relevant external functions or APIs if additional data or computations are required, combines the LLM model's output with the external data or results, and provides a comprehensive response to the user.

High Level Architecture- Healthcare assistant

The architecture for the Healthcare Agent is shown in the preceding figure and is as follows:

A sample code using function calling through the Mistral LLM can be found at mistral-on-aws.

Data privacy and security are of utmost importance in the healthcare sector because of the sensitive nature of personal health information (PHI) and the potential consequences of data breaches or unauthorized access. Compliance with regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR is crucial for healthcare organizations handling patient data. To maintain robust data protection and regulatory compliance, healthcare organizations can use Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, a comprehensive set of security and privacy controls provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Amazon Bedrock Guardrails offers a multi-layered approach to data security, including encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, audit logging, ground truth validation and incident response mechanisms. It also provides advanced security features such as data residency controls, which allow organizations to specify the geographic regions where their data can be stored and processed, maintaining compliance with local data privacy laws.

When using LLM function calling in the healthcare domain, it's essential to implement robust security measures and follow best practices for handling sensitive patient information. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails can play a crucial role in this regard by helping to provide a secure foundation for deploying and operating healthcare applications and services that use LLM capabilities.

Some key security measures enabled by Amazon Bedrock Guardrails are:

By using Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, healthcare organizations can confidently deploy LLM function calling in their applications and services, maintaining robust data security, privacy protection, and regulatory compliance while enabling the transformative benefits of AI-powered healthcare assistants.

Exploring the use of AI within healthcare began in the 1960s and has expanded substantially within the sector, with the technology currently used within precision medicine, drug discovery and development, and robotic surgery.   

Although many researchers and experts have deemed the technology promising, it is crucial to address the ethical and societal considerations accompanying AI technology integration. 

Healthcare providers must consider proper use cases of the technology in the healthcare setting and have a complete understanding of the tech because, as Harjinder Sandhu, Microsoft's CTO of health platforms and solutions, told HIMSS TV, there are high-value and low-risk use cases and vice versa. 

""One of the things that AI systems can do is summarize patients in various contexts depending on who is asking the question and for what purpose,"" Sandhu said.

""The problem with that is that if the AI system hallucinates information, it makes up information about that patient or it omits important information that can lead to catastrophic consequences for that patient. That's an example of a really high-value but also high-risk use case,"" he added.

New capabilities to complement BRG's Healthcare Performance Improvement and Clinical Economics practices, offering unique end-to-end solution set for providers and health plans

WASHINGTON, March 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Global expert services and consulting firm BRG today announced the expansion of its Healthcare Advisory team. Co-led by industry leaders and BRG Managing Directors Rick May, MD and Jeff Leibach, the group will support providers' and health plans' strategic growth plans and major initiatives through expertise in enterprise strategic planning, revenue growth, population health and clinical quality improvement.

The expanded team will also include BRG Managing Directors Tod Baker, David Brueggeman, Julia Clark, Brian Fisher and Dawn Knight; and Directors Brett Caplan and Kurt Eicher.

The talent joining BRG's Healthcare Advisory team brings immediate depth and increases industry credibility. Combined, Knight and Baker have more than 50 years of experience working in executive roles and helping improve quality performance at healthcare providers. Clark, Fisher and Brueggeman each bring decades of consulting and industry experience to build and lead solutions around population health and value-based care (VBC); enterprise strategy, partnerships and service-line planning; and managed care and reimbursement teams. Caplan and Eicher provide additional depth and breadth of experience in strategic revenue growth through contracting and payer-provider partnerships for organizations including startups, health plans and large health systems. 

""Today's hospitals and health systems are encountering unprecedented challenges, from diminishing revenue, rising costs and tighter margins to rapid-fire policy shifts and ongoing supply chain disruptions,"" said Dr. May. ""Traditional levers hospital leaders have used to address these issues are often not effective on their own—and too often providers are stuck with a false choice between financial solvency and clinical quality. Our data-driven processes help hospitals identify the most important areas to work on to rapidly improve clinical quality and drive measurable ROI [return on improvement], empowering organizations to achieve better care for their patients while simultaneously improving their financial performance."" 

The Healthcare Advisory team will complement and collaborate with BRG's Healthcare Performance Improvement and Clinical Economics practices, offering providers and health plans a unique end-to-end solution set. The team will focus its efforts in three critical areas:

""The substantial problems facing healthcare organizations require collaborative, multifaceted solutions,"" said Leibach. ""Our team of industry experts will serve as a bridge between BRG's existing offerings, enabling the firm to not only design high-level strategic roadmaps but also help implement those strategies on the ground. The group's extensive experience in strategy, finance and clinical quality improvement brings unparalleled depth and breadth to BRG and its healthcare clients. The team's ability to bring both payer and provider perspectives is unique and valuable, as traditional payers are providing more care than ever and health systems are taking on increasing amounts of risk.""

""This new practice group further builds on BRG's comprehensive healthcare offerings to better serve our clients and meet the needs of the industry moving forward,"" said BRG Chief Executive Officer Tri MacDonald. ""The advisory team will complement and expand our capabilities in healthcare performance improvement, clinical economics, analytics, policy, financial consulting and more. I couldn't be more excited to have Rick and Jeff at the helm.""

IAM Healthcare Bargaining Committee Member Kelly Williams read a powerful message from her coworkers in the executive office of The Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center. Her statement listed the reasons safe staffing levels are critical to patient care at OSU hospitals and called for OSU executives to recruit and retain more front-line healthcare staff.

Williams' courage was reinforced by the fact that OSU Chief Operating Officer Jay Anderson's office was packed full of her coworkers. The petitions they delivered were from more than 1,200 front-line healthcare workers and Columbus community members supporting these IAM Healthcare members.                                                                       

“We routinely hear stories of patient care units that should be staffed with one Patient Care Associate for four, five, or six patients,” said Williams. “But instead they are expected to care for 10, 11, 12 or more patients at once.” 

The Medical Center has acknowledged a first-year turnover rate of more than 50% among the highly skilled Patient Care Associates (PCAs) and Psychiatric Care Technicians (PCTs). 

“It's clear when we're given the bare minimum of PCTs that staffing is done reactively and not proactively.” said Dylan England-Carroll, a Senior PCT who also read a statement on behalf of their coworkers. “Our patients are going through the toughest days of their lives. They deserve better from the hospital, but OSU executives are giving them the bare minimum number of support staff and stretching us thin.”

The day after the action, OSU Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) Deana Sievert attended negotiations to respond to IAM Healthcare members' critical staffing and ratio concerns. Bargaining committee members asked questions and delivered powerful testimonies on the daily challenges faced by patients, PCAs and PCTs. IAM Healthcare Bargaining Committee Members expressed appreciation for CNO Sievert's respectful engagement, but said it was clear that she and other executives lack a concrete plan to address the understaffing crisis. 

In response to the continued failures of OSU executives, PCA and PCT workplace leaders have called for an informational picketing action at the Medical Center on Tuesday, March 19, 2025. 

With the only remaining scheduled meeting date between the parties and a federal mediator approaching, the workplace leaders say they and their colleagues are prepared to take further action if OSU executives do not make movement on safe staffing, recruitment, and retention.

IAM Healthcare is a rapidly growing department within the powerhouse IAM Union, which has more than 600,000 current and retired members across the U.S. and Canada. International Union leaders backed their membership's readiness for further action.

“We will bring the full resources of our international union to bear in support of these courageous IAM Healthcare professionals and their struggle to protect their patients,” said IAM Union International President Brian Bryant. “The OSU executives still have time to do the right thing by investing in safe staffing, recruitment, and retention of front-line staff.”


                        Union Member Rights and Officer Responsibilities Under the LMRDA The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) guarantees certain rights to union members and imposes certain responsibilities on union officers.

                        Let Waste Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox.
                    
                
            



WM sees future healthcare trends, such as the growth of at-home healthcare, as a future business opportunity as it works to integrate Stericycle's medical waste assets.

Four months into WM's acquisition of Stericycle, the company has focused on ramping up facilities, completing divestitures and tracking key medical waste trends to market itself as a “comprehensive” option for medical waste collection, transportation and treatment.

WM is in the process of integrating Stericycle's medical waste and secure information destruction businesses into a segment now known as WM Healthcare Solutions. When WM announced the $7.2 billion deal last year, executives said the time was right to return to the medical waste sector due in part to the expanding population of aging people. 

The WM Healthcare Solutions business is expected to grow about 9% in 2025, which WM says will likely be driven by organic revenue growth and initiatives such as fleet and asset optimization.

WM had previously dabbled in the space on and off over the years, but hadn't become a major presence in the sector until recently, due in part to competition from companies like Stericycle, analysts said. In 2005, the company launched Waste Management Healthcare Solutions to provide regulated medical waste services for hospitals and other large waste generators, with the goal of becoming a major player in the industry. Yet by 2013 they had eased off those plans, noting medical waste represented less than $50 million of revenue. WM later sold most of its remaining medical waste assets.

Today, WM is following specific medical waste trends that will offer opportunities for new and expanded business, said Rafa Carrasco, president of WM Healthcare Solutions via email. “Sites of care for patients are significantly changing, with a growing trend towards receiving care in outpatient settings like ambulatory surgery centers, retail clinics, and even at home,” he said. 

Carrasco says the future demand for at-home care is a particularly notable trend, as it is expected to generate more waste, including waste from self-injectable medications meant to treat chronic illnesses. That in turn will lead to “more demand for proper medical and pharmaceutical waste disposal options.”

WM entered a highly competitive market when it broke back into the medical waste space, Carrasco said. One type of competitor is what Carrasco calls “large-quantity waste generators,” including some hospitals, which currently have their own onsite treatment processes such as autoclaves. Others in the medical waste space have made a name for themselves by specializing in either collection or transportation services.

Yet WM sees itself as being in an ideal position to offer treatment options alongside collection and transportation, which will help medical facilities simplify and streamline the waste management process, Carrasco said. WM Healthcare Services is positioned to do this because Stericycle already had an “extensive treatment and transportation infrastructure” as well as route density and overall knowledge of market dynamics, he said.  

WM Healthcare Services is currently working to integrate numerous aspects of Stericycle's operations, namely the new 110,000-square-foot medical waste incinerator project Stericycle completed in October in McCarran, Nevada. The $110 million, designed to accept material from hospitals and healthcare systems in the Western U.S., has gone through testing and is now ramping up operations, Carrasco said. Stericycle has 18 medical waste incinerator facilities around the world, according to WM's most recent securities filings.

The company expects to process 70% of volumes from Stericycle's Western customers by the end of March, and should be able to process all the remaining volumes from that region by the end of May, he said. The facility is expected to be fully operational by the end of December. 

In filings, WM underscored the importance of integrating Stericycle's assets and operations, which will take “a significant degree of difficulty and management attention” due to the size of the deal. 

Over the next three years, WM expects synergies from the deal to be about $250 million, with about $100 million of that in 2025. During a January earnings call, CEO Jim Fish also noted that WM would identify medical facilities that could benefit from cross-selling opportunities, starting as early as 2026.

WM is also in the process of identifying what to do with other elements of Stericycle's business and assets. Stericycle had 69 autoclaves and facilities described as “alternative medical waste treatment facilities, as well as 167 transfer stations as of December 31. WM listed 35 of Stericycle's locations as ""held for sale,” according to filings. 

One recent deal, completed on January 2, was the divestiture of all Stericycle businesses in Spain and Portugal to Urbaser, an international environmental solutions company. Stericycle continues to operate in other markets in Western Europe, Carrasco said. 

WM is still operating Stericycle's services under the Stericycle name, but that will change in coming years. WM will eventually rebrand those services under the WM Healthcare Solutions umbrella, which “will take some time to complete,” he said.

                Doctors in New York will have to discuss treatment costs upfront with patients under a new law.

The routine is familiar for most people: When checking in for an appointment with a doctor or other health care provider, patients typically complete and sign a pile of paperwork, including a form that contains some version of the statement, ""I agree to pay for all charges not covered by my insurance company.""

Patients may not feel comfortable making that financial promise, often before they have any idea what the charges will be. But they generally sign the form anyway, because the alternative is often not to get the services they're seeking.

As a result, consumers may be responsible for unexpected bills and at risk for medical debt.

In New York, state officials, advocates and the health care provider community have been engaged in a policy tug-of-war over efforts to protect consumers. Patient advocates don't want them to get stuck signing blank-check forms that put them in financial jeopardy. Doctors, hospitals and other providers don't want to disrupt their practices' workflow and payment logistics with cost discussions and paperwork, especially after services have been provided. 

State officials' efforts to find a satisfying compromise have so far fallen short.

At the center is a state law that took effect last fall to prohibit requiring patients to sign such consent-to-pay forms before they've received treatment and discussed the costs.

Legal analysts described it as the first such law in the country. Physician groups cried foul, saying it would raise payment issues and other significant logistical problems.

Those concerns found traction. Shortly before the law's start date, the state's health department delayed its implementation indefinitely. In addition, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul's proposed fiscal year 2026 budget would let providers go back to requiring patients to agree to pay for care in advance of receiving treatment. It also clarified that the consent requirements would not apply to emergency care.

A key provision of the new law would remain in place, however: Doctors and other providers would still be obligated to have the cost discussion with patients before the patient is asked to sign the form agreeing to pay for the service. 

Some consider even the remaining provision a significant step.

""Providers having an affirmative obligation to discuss treatment costs is unique,"" said Gregory Mitchell, a partner in the health and life sciences practice group at McDermott Will & Emery law firm who specializes in managed care. Clients from around the country have been reaching out to the law firm with questions.

Requiring providers to discuss costs with patients, whether before or after services are provided, would pose a ""significant burden,"" he said. Doctors and other providers typically don't know specifics about patient deductibles, cost sharing or other insurance coverage details until after a claim is submitted to a health plan.

Health care services are different than refrigerators or other goods that people buy, doctors say. If a patient gets a colonoscopy and doesn't want to pay for it, ""it's not possible to take the service back,"" said Jerome Cohen, a gastroenterologist and the president of the Medical Society of the State of New York, which represents physicians. 

As for the proposed changes in the 2026 budget, Cohen said the medical society ""very much appreciates the governor's efforts to try to fix this problematic financial consent requirement.""

But patient advocates are pushing back. The current practice is ""unfair and it's wrong,"" said Elisabeth Benjamin, vice president of health initiatives at the Community Service Society of New York, a nonprofit that has successfully pushed for passage of several medical debt-related laws in recent years. No patient should ever have to preemptively agree to pay whatever a provider charges, Benjamin said.

In a written response to questions, Danielle De Souza, a spokesperson for the New York Department of Health, said that the proposed law change is justified, ""given the burden of this requirement on both patients and providers."" De Souza didn't respond to a request for clarification about what those patient burdens are.

Helen Krim walked out of a doctor's office in the Bronx borough of New York City a few years ago rather than sign an open-ended form agreeing to pay for any services recommended by the doctor.

It was the first time that Krim, who is covered by Medicare, had visited that primary care practice. When she told them she didn't want to sign the form, she was told they wouldn't serve her unless she did.

""I'm one of those annoying people who actually reads the forms,"" the retired bank project manager said. ""It's kind of like signing a consent to be scammed."" She found another practice that didn't ask her to sign a similar form.

There are other consumer medical debt protections at the federal and state level. The federal No Surprises Act restricts providers from billing consumers for out-of-network services in certain instances. It also requires providers to give good-faith cost estimates for self-pay patients. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a final rule in January that would have removed medical debt from people's credit reports, but the rule's implementation has been frozen by the Trump administration.

Several states besides New York have also taken steps to protect consumers with medical debt.

Benjamin said that simply requiring an unspecified ""discussion"" about costs doesn't address patients' potential unlimited financial liability. Under a bill that Benjamin's organization has drafted, providers would have to give patients a written good-faith estimate of their expected costs before the patient receives services and patients could not be held liable for unlimited or unspecified costs beyond that estimate.

""Let's be the first state to really have fair rules of engagement for both the providers and the patients about what is it that you're agreeing to be financially liable for at the point, beforehand,"" Benjamin said.

So far, though, the measure has not been introduced, with the focus in Albany on the governor's budget proposal.

Providers, too, are taking a wait-and-see attitude, Mitchell said, because the budget plan must still move through the legislative process.

Another New York medical debt-related law that took effect in October takes aim at the use of credit cards to pay for medical services. The Hochul administration has not proposed changing it. The law prohibits providers from requiring pre-authorization of credit cards or keeping a patient's card on file. It also requires providers to notify patients of the risks of paying for medical care with credit cards, which may lack medical debt protections. In addition, providers aren't allowed to help patients complete credit card applications under the law.

The laws are aimed at stopping unfair billing practices and reducing medical debt for New Yorkers. Earlier laws ban credit reporting of all medical debt, prohibit hospitals from suing patients with incomes under 400% of the poverty level, among other things.

New York providers don't like the credit card law either, though it hasn't generated the pushback seen with the consent-to-pay law.

In a statement, Brian Conway, a spokesperson for the Greater New York Hospital Association, said: ""It's important to clarify that hospitals do not oppose the goals of the hospital financial assistance law reforms overall, but rather the operational burdens and patient disclosure overload that a few specific provisions create.""

Tampa General Hospital (TGH) and Boston-based Mass General Brigham (MGB) are collaborating on a radiation oncology center, offering a new option for cancer care to Floridians in and around Palm Beach County.

The center is expected to offer more modern medical technology in addition to improved access and a ""coordinated patient experience.""

Construction costs for the new facility were not disclosed.

""This new center represents a significant evolution in the partnership between TGH and MGB, as we continue to execute our overall strategy to transform healthcare through innovation and collaboration with the nation's leading providers and physician-scientists,"" said John Couris, president and CEO of Tampa General.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

Under the partnership, TGH and MGB will open a 10,000-square-foot, co-branded and jointly owned radiation oncology center at Legacy Place in Palm Beach Gardens.

TGH will manage day-to-day operations, while MGB Radiation Oncology will provide expert quality and safety oversight.

In adhering to the tenets of academic medicine, the collaboration will create an integrated team of experts to address a spectrum of patient needs, from physicians and dosimetrists to patient advocates and administrators.

All members of the team will cross-collaborate, share and support each other to deliver responsive and customized care, the hospitals said.

The new center will be open for patient care in 2026.

THE LARGER TREND

According to the Florida Department of Health, for more than a decade, cancer has been the second leading cause of death in Florida, after heart disease. And the state has the second-highest cancer burden in the nation, with an average of 115,000 new cancers diagnosed and reported each year.

ON THE RECORD

""As we look to provide the most innovative, patient-centric cancer care possible across Florida, this new center and elevated collaboration with MGB is critical to achieving this goal"" said Dr. Abe Schwarzberg, executive vice president and chief of Oncology at Tampa General and president of Tampa General Provider Network. ""We've already seen how our collaboration can benefit the patients we serve, and by working alongside MGB to provide our patients with access to the expertise, experience and research findings from two of the top academic health systems, we have the potential to make a significant impact on their treatment outcomes.""

Mehmet Oz, who previously advocated for expanding the privatized Medicare program, said he would tackle upcoding among MA plans if confirmed.

Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the CMS, pledged to scrutinize Medicare Advantage insurers in an effort to rein in costs during a confirmation hearing last week.

“We're actually apparently paying more for Medicare Advantage than we're paying for regular Medicare. So it's upside down,” he said in front of the Senate Finance Committee Friday.

If confirmed, Oz, a physician and TV personality, would manage the federal agency that provides coverage to more than 160 million people through Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act exchanges. 

Oz has previously advocated for expanding the MA program and worked as a broker for the plans, according to the New York Times. Additionally, he owns stock in UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest MA insurer — though he has said he would divest his stake in some healthcare and pharmaceutical companies if confirmed as CMS administrator. 

Oz could join the agency as MA, where private insurers contract with the federal government to manage beneficiaries' care, has become an increasingly popular option for seniors and other enrollees.

However, the coverage option isn't driving down costs for the government. Medicare will spend $84 billion more on MA enrollees this year than it would if those beneficiaries were in the traditional fee-for-service program, according to a report published last week by congressional advisory MedPAC. 

One way to tackle higher costs in MA is through cutting down on upcoding, Oz told the committee Friday. MA plans are paid a fixed amount each month per member, adjusted for enrollees' health risks. 

But beneficiaries in the privatized plans tend to rack up more diagnosis codes than those in traditional Medicare, driving up their health risks and thus payments to insurers. Increased coding intensity and favorable selection of less expensive beneficiaries are the main reasons MA plans cost more, according to MedPAC. 

During the hearing, Oz noted plans sometimes conduct health assessments to find new diagnoses to add to their medical records, even if those conditions wouldn't require any additional healthcare services. 

“If someone's showing up at your home to figure out if you have a small plaque in your carotid [artery], because they're going to charge a lot more for the care of your plaque — which they're not actually going to do anything for — that's wrong,” he said. 

The nominee also argued the CMS could cut down the amount of prior authorization requests, where providers have to receive approval from patients' insurers before they perform a service. Claims denials by MA plans, including through the use of artificial intelligence tools, has become a concern for lawmakers and regulators. 

Oz suggested the CMS could limit the number of procedures subject to prior authorization to 1,000, compared to about 5,500 procedures today. 

“A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town,” he said. “We actually have to go after places and areas where we're not managing the American peoples' money well.”

Wellness Tourism: Beyond a Trend, a New Essential for Modern Living

The integration of Scientific Wellness and Retreat Therapies plays a crucial role in crafting transformative experiences that align with the lifestyles of modern travelers—those who view health as an essential part of life.

Phuket, a world-renowned tourism hub in southern Thailand, continues to attract international visitors year-round. Renowned for its breathtaking natural beauty and pristine coastal landscapes, the island is emerging as a leading destination for luxury wellness retreats, offering the perfect blend of rejuvenation and relaxation amidst stunning surroundings.

Furthermore, Phuket boasts world-class infrastructure and tourism services, including luxury hotels, resorts, fine dining establishments, and a diverse range of recreational activities. These elements collectively position Phuket as a high-potential tourism hub and a key driver of Thailand's travel industry.

GE HealthCare expands invasive cardiology solutions portfolio with AltiX AI.i for elevated experience in catheterization lab and electrophysiology procedures

CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GE HealthCare (Nasdaq: GEHC) today announced the launch of the AltiX AI.i edition of Mac-Lab™, CardioLab™ and ComboLab™. The AltiX AI.i editions are designed to improve the user experience, elevating workflow in the cardiac catheterization (cath) lab and supporting even the most complex electrophysiology (EP) procedures. These latest editions offer new features that can streamline workflow and enhance interoperability, while upholding strong cybersecurity standards.


Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has nearly doubled over the past three decades, affecting more than 500 million people worldwide. During this period, both deaths and disabilities due to CVD have been on the rise globally.1 As cardiac cases continue to rise, there is an urgent need for tools that improve the efficiency of cardiac cath and EP procedures. Efficient diagnosis and therapy are key elements of addressing the growing demand for care.




“AltiX AI.i is built on more than two decades of experience, leadership and innovation in invasive cardiology to enhance cath labs and EP procedures and empower clinicians to deliver the best possible outcomes,” said Jyoti Gera, CEO, CardioVascular & Interventional Solutions, GE HealthCare. “By automating routine tasks and streamlining workflow, AltiX AI.i allows clinicians to focus on what truly matters – providing exceptional patient care.”




Mac-Lab for cardiac catheterization



The AltiX AI.i edition of Mac-Lab recording system combines functionality with workflow optimization. Clinicians can adopt this solution to elevate the cath lab user experience. The integration of the diastolic pressure ratio (dPR) algorithm allows users to easily perform this measurement, and builds on its ability to capture diastolic hyperemia-free ratio (DFR) measurements. These measurements are used to assess the severity of coronary artery disease. Mac-Lab provides optional Cath Lab Command Center access with a large display, advanced video and layouts, and customized documentation tools for a better user experience.




CardioLab for EP procedures



For EP procedures, the AltiX AI.i edition of CardioLab offers improved signal quality for visualization of physiological signals using the Prucka™ 3 digital amplifier. Prucka 3 is a solution that reduces environmental noise, maintains high signal fidelity and provides new signal-filtering capabilities for more advanced evaluations.2 The latest CardioLab edition showcases GE HealthCare's collaboration with Volta Medical, Volta Interface, which utilizes PruckaStream to share real-time data to inform its Volta AF-Xplorer™ decision support system. The feature is designed to support clinicians with real-time assessments using artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically assess areas believed to initiate or maintain atrial fibrillation drivers. For an optimal visual experience, users can also harness the EP Command Center.




ComboLab for a comprehensive solution



ComboLab seamlessly integrates EP and hemodynamic recording into a single system, offering versatile functionality for both cath lab procedures and EP exams. ComboLab merges the best of Mac-Lab and CardioLab to give clinicians a comprehensive solution to manage various cardiac procedures in one location. Its familiar interface and workflow ease the learning curve, and its capability to document and export diagnostic data helps capture more information at the point of care.




""The introduction of AltiX AI.i reinforces our commitment to advancing cardiac care. These improved solutions are designed to enhance diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities, which are crucial for diagnosing and treating various heart conditions,"" said Arnaud Marie, General Manager, Interventional Solutions, GE HealthCare. ""This launch is an important step in our ongoing mission to equip healthcare providers with interventional solutions that evolve alongside their needs.""




In recognition of its innovation and leadership, GE HealthCare was recently honored by Frost & Sullivan as the 2024 Company of the Year in the Global Next-Generation EP Labs Industry. This prestigious award highlights GE HealthCare's commitment to growth and excellence in the field.




GE HealthCare will showcase the AltiX AI.i edition of Mac-Lab, CardioLab and ComboLab at the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) 2025 annual congress taking place on March 30 - April 1 in Vienna, Austria and Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) 2025 annual meeting on April 24 - April 27 in San Diego. AltiX AI.i is available for order in the United States and will launch in global markets later this year. * Consult with your GE HealthCare sales representative for more information on the availability of AltiX AI.i in your country.

* AltiX AI.i is 510(k) cleared and CE mark pending.

On March 14, Mehmet Oz, M.D., had his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee to become the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator. In a two-and-a-half-hour session, Dr. Oz mostly deflected concerns from either side of the aisle.

In his opening remarks, Oz voiced his intent to support Trump's plan to make Americans healthy again. He said President Trump's executive order on transparency shifts power to the American people. ""We should incentivize doctors and our healthcare providers to optimize care."" Oz said that artificial intelligence (AI) can assist with their workflow.

""Let's be aggressive in modernizing our tools to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse,"" Oz mentioned as a focus point. ""This will stop unscrupulous people from stealing from vulnerable Americans.""

Before his hearing, Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren requested that the nominee divest financial ties to healthcare and pharmaceutical companies that could benefit from his policy decisions. During the hearing, however, she focused on his views about whether private Medicare plans are overcharging the government, reporters Reed Abelson and Susanne Craig of The New York Times wrote. ""She and Dr. Oz seemed to agree on the need to tackle potential fraud and waste.""

As Abelson and Craig wrote, ""Democrats seemed most frustrated by Dr. Oz's stance toward Medicaid, the state-federal program that covers 72 million low-income Americans. 'All my colleagues want to know, are you going to cut Medicaid?' asked Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington. But Dr. Oz, who has not spoken much about the program he would also oversee as head of the agency, did not answer directly. He said he did not know the details of the Republican budget discussions, in which lawmakers are looking at hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts that could result in people's loss of coverage as it became more difficult to enroll and states had to shoulder more of the burden.""

Meanwhile, with regard to issues around the Medicare Advantage program, Healthcare Dive's Emily Olsen wrote on March 17 that “Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the CMS, pledged to scrutinize Medicare Advantage insurers in an effort to rein in costs during a confirmation hearing last week. ‘We're actually apparently paying more for Medicare Advantage than we're paying for regular Medicare. So it's upside down,' he said in front of the Senate Finance Committee Friday.” As Olsen noted, “Oz has previously advocated for expanding the MA program and worked as a broker for the plans, according to the New York Times. Additionally, he owns stock in UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest MA insurer — though he has said he would divest his stake in some healthcare and pharmaceutical companies if confirmed as CMS administrator.”

Further, Olsen wrote, “The nominee also argued the CMS could cut down the amount of prior authorization requests, where providers have to receive approval from patients' insurers before they perform a service. Claims denials by MA plans, including through the use of artificial intelligence tools, has become a concern for lawmakers and regulators. Oz suggested the CMS could limit the number of procedures subject to prior authorization to 1,000, compared to about 5,500 procedures today.”

The GOP-led committee will schedule a vote on whether to send Oz's nomination to the full Senate.","{'href': 'https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com', 'title': 'Healthcare Innovation'}"

The National Health Service of England will no longer be an independent organization supported by the British government. By slashing duplication, the Department of Health and Social Care said it will reduce unnecessary administrative spending and empower NHS staff to deliver better care for patients. 

""We now need to bring NHS England and DHSC together so we can deliver the biggest bang for our buck for patients, as we look to implement the three big shifts – analog to digital, sickness to prevention and hospital to community – and build an NHS fit for the future,"" said Sir James Mackey, NHS England Transition CEO, in a statement.

WHY IT MATTERS

Reversing a major top-down decision ushered in by former Prime Minister David Cameron in 2012, Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on March 13 that the move to slash the £200 billion of taxpayer money it takes to operate NHS England would free up NHS itself to focus more on patients.

""That money could and should be spent on nurses, doctors, operations, GP appointments,"" Starmer said in a video posted by Financial Times.

Earlier in the week, NHS England staff were warned of job cuts of up to 50%, and several senior officials resigned, according to the story. 

NHS England's incoming chair, Dr. Penny Dash, said in an agency statement that she will ""work to bring together NHS England and DHSC to reduce duplication and streamline functions.""

""When money is so tight, we cannot justify such a complex bureaucracy with two organizations doing the same jobs,"" Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said in the announcement about resorbing NHS England. ""We need more doers and fewer checkers, which is why I'm devolving resources and responsibilities to the NHS frontline.""

""We know that while unsettling for our staff, today's announcement will bring welcome clarity as we focus on tackling the significant challenges ahead and delivering on the government's priorities for patients,"" Mackey added.

Streeting noted that the creation of the NHS England bureaucracy ""led to the longest waiting times, lowest patient satisfaction and most expensive NHS in history.""

The number of people working for NHS more than doubled since 2010, when the NHS delivered its shortest waiting times and the highest patient satisfaction, the agency said.

DHSC also said that a centralized model could procure cutting-edge technology more rapidly at a lower cost and work more closely with the life sciences sector to advance treatments.

""If it's done well, with meaningful alignment between innovation, procurement and delivery, it could genuinely transform services and patient experience,"" Dr. Rachael Grimaldi, cofounder and CEO of CardMedic, said in a statement shared with several media outlets.

Dr. Rachael Fox, executive vice president of UK and EMEA for Altera Digital Health, said digital maturity and transformation have progressed across the NHS, including the interoperability of patient information.

""To support recovery and true reform, it's essential that momentum with innovation to drive better patient outcomes is maintained while we work through this transition,"" she said.

THE LARGER TREND

Mackey noted NHS England has played a vital role in improving the nation's health, including leading COVID-19 vaccinations and introducing ""the latest, most innovative new treatments for patients.""

In October, NHS England rolled out radiology artificial intelligence across 10 health trusts providing access to more than 75 regulatory-approved AI technologies from a single platform created by Deepc, an AI company.

NHS England said at the time that in rapidly deploying radiology AI, it could help reduce wait times for patients, increase the speed of diagnoses and help relieve pressure on NHS radiology departments.

ON THE RECORD

""Just because reform is difficult does not mean it should not be done,"" Streeting said in a statement. ""This government will never duck the hard work of reform. We will take on vested interests and change the status quo.""

In a Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing Friday to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Dr. Mehmet Oz would make no commitment to not cut Medicaid.

Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, asked the CMS nominee whether he would make cuts to the Medicaid program.

""I want to make sure patients have resources to protect them if they get ill,"" Oz began to answer before Wyden cut him off, asking for a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer.

""The way you protect Medicaid is making sure it is viable at every level, which includes having enough practitioners to afford the services, paying them enough to do what you request of them and making sure that patients are able to actually use Medicaid,"" Oz answered.

Some Republicans have proposed reducing spending by making cuts to Medicaid. The spending bill that passed on Friday went through as a stop-gap measure to avoid a government shutdown and included no cuts to the program.

Oz told the committee he supported Medicaid work requirements.

Oz also talked about giving patients the data they need to monitor their own health, in efforts to reduce both chronic disease and spending.

One tactic that would work, he said, would be to give real-time information from physicians and other providers to patients on their well-being. He said there could be a resource to call or perhaps there could be reimbursement for choices of healthy lifestyles.

""I think that dramatically changes the power dynamic,"" Oz said. ""Make the American people feel they are the experts on their well-being.""

Oz also discussed the ability of technology and AI to reduce CMS administrative processes, including pre-authorization.

An estimated 12% of CMS' budget is spent on bureaucratic processes, and much of the money goes to middlemen, Oz said. 

Technology has the ability to automate a lot of these processes, which would cut administrative costs and help reduce the frustration of pre-authorization, according to Oz.

Oz said he intends to go after some Medicare Advantage insurers that take actions, amounting to fraud, to boost payments by upcoding patient illnesses, as insurers are paid based upon the severity of illnesses of members, according to The Wall Street Journal. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, as well as Democrats Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont all asked about Medicare Advantage.

In November, then President-elect Donald Trump nominated the TV celebrity, cardiothoracic surgeon and former Senate candidate as secretary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Oz has no direct experience in the Medicare and Medicaid agency. In 2018, Trump appointed Oz to the Presidential Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, reappointing him to the position in 2020.

In 2022, Oz ran unsuccessfully for Senate in Pennsylvania, losing to Democrat John Fetterman.

Oz is best known for daytime talk show ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" that ran for 13 seasons from 2009 through 2022, winning multiple Daytime Emmy Awards.

The show ended in 2022 when Oz launched his Senate campaign.

With Gift Aid, your generous donation of £10 would be worth £12.50 at no extra cost to you.

I am a UK taxpayer and I understand that if I pay less Income and /or Capital Gains Tax than the amount of Gift Aid claimed on all my donations in the relevant tax year, it is my responsibility to pay any difference.

In our 35th year we're asking people to donate £35 – that's just £1 for every year we've been providing life-changing information. Any donation you make helps us continue our work towards a world where HIV is no longer a threat to health or happiness.

Most people with unsuppressed HIV in a large population study in Uganda were already diagnosed but not in clinical care, suggesting that re-engaging people with HIV and ensuring that they are receiving antiretroviral treatment could have a substantial impact on HIV transmission.

The findings were presented last week at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI 2025) in San Francisco.

A second study presented at the conference showed that men with HIV disengaged from care in Malawi were more likely to return to care if they received a supportive low-cost counselling intervention tailored to address the challenges that men face in taking antiretroviral treatment and remaining in care. A third study, carried out in Zambia, found that an intervention to encourage welcoming and supportive behaviours among care providers significantly improved return to care and retention in care among people who had interrupted treatment.  

The Ugandan study, carried out by the Rakai Health Sciences research group, investigated what proportion of the population in this rural district had detectable HIV viremia, and how many of these people were already diagnosed but disengaged from care.

When viral load is detectable, this indicates that HIV is replicating in the body. If the person is taking HIV treatment but their viral load is detectable, the treatment is not working properly. There may still be a risk of HIV transmission to sexual partners.

A patient's regular and ongoing engagement with medical care at a health care facility. 

A group of participants in a trial who receive standard treatment, or no treatment at all, rather than the experimental treatment which is being tested. Also known as a control arm.



The presence of virus in the blood.



A healthcare professional's recommendation that a person sees another medical specialist or service.

The study recruited people aged 15-49 in 34 communities and carried out HIV testing. Everyone who tested positive for HIV received a qualitative viral load test which can detect viral load above 1000 copies/ml. Viral load above this level is associated with a risk of HIV transmission. Participants were asked about their HIV status and any past or current antiretroviral use.

People newly diagnosed with HIV during the study were referred to a clinic for HIV treatment and followed up three months later to confirm that they had started treatment.

Anyone previously diagnosed with HIV was referred to a clinic for treatment. Those who had never started treatment were followed up three months later to confirm that they had started treatment.

The study tested 17,841 people; 3170 tested positive for HIV, 3134 underwent viral load testing and 316 (10%) had viral load above 1000 copies/ml. Just over half of those with detectable viral load (54%) said they were newly diagnosed with HIV, 10% said they had not started treatment, 33% said they were in care and 2.5% were previously in care.

However, after looking for clinical records and carrying out testing for antiretroviral drugs, a different picture emerged. In fact, one in five people who said they were newly diagnosed turned out to be already diagnosed but had not started treatment or had dropped out of care. Altogether, 83% of people with viremia were not in clinical care and three-quarters of this group had never started treatment.



Men, and people over 30 years of age, were more likely to have been misclassified.

A blood test to detect antiretroviral drugs showed that only 4% of those with viremia had any detectable antiretroviral drugs in their bloodstream, all of whom were currently in care.

Half of those who had started treatment dropped out within a year. At the time of the study, the median time since the last clinic visit was 2.8 years.

A randomised trial carried out in Malawi showed that men with HIV who received person-centred counselling delivered by lay people were just as likely to return to care and stay in care as men who received more complex and costly interventions.

The study, carried out through the Partners in Hope NGO in Malawi, recruited 569 men living with HIV who had been traced from chart reviews at 13 health facilities. Men were eligible for inclusion in the study if they had been diagnosed with HIV but had not initiated antiretroviral treatment or had interrupted treatment.

Participants were randomised to one of three study arms:

The primary outcome of the study was the proportion of participants in each arm who had initiated ART within three months of enrolment and had been out of care for less than 28 days by six months after treatment initiation.

Study participants had a mean age of 39 years and 91% had previously started treatment. Participants had been on treatment for a median of 12 months and out of care for a median of two months at the time of enrolment.



At nine months after enrolment, there was no significant difference in ART engagement between study arms (76% in the counselling arm vs 72% in the home-based ART arm and 85% in the stepped intervention arm).

In-depth interviews with 92 participants found that the elements of interventions most valued by the participants was counselling and positive interactions with healthcare workers. Kind and interactive counselling that offered tailored solutions and compelling messages was more important than dispensing ART at home, the interviews showed.

Treatment interruptions can be attributable to poor experiences of health care and fears about returning to care after missed appointments. Researchers at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia and universities in the United States designed an intervention to promote friendlier, more person-centred attitudes in healthcare staff, using training and coaching, measurement and feedback, and facility-level incentives such as recognition for staff.

To evaluate the effect of the intervention on client return to care after treatment interruption and sustained engagement in care, the researchers conducted a randomised trial involving 24 health facilities between August 2019 and November 2021. During the study period, 128,901 people with HIV were more than 30 days late and were judged to have interrupted treatment. Sixty-four per cent of those who interrupted treatment were female, most (66%) were aged 25-44 and one-third had been on treatment for at least five years.



During the one-year follow-up period, 65% of the control group and 71% of the intervention group returned to care, a risk difference of 5.7%. Among those who returned to care, people in the intervention group were less likely to experience another treatment interruption during the follow-up period (55% vs 44%, risk difference 10.4%). After one year, a total of 73% in the control group and 82% in the intervention group were still in care after returning to care. Overall, 49% of the control group and 58% of the intervention group were in care one year after the study began.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news","Mount Sinai team creates AI algorithm to detect sleep disorder","https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/mount-sinai-team-creates-ai-algorithm-detect-sleep-disorder","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:46:32 GMT","






Dr. Emmanuel During, associate professor of neurology and medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, where he sees patients at The Mount Sinai Integrative Sleep Center

REM sleep behavior disorder, or RBD, is a condition that causes abnormal movements or brief repeated twitching during sleep, and occasional episodes of dream enactment.

THE CHALLENGE

RBD affects more than one million Americans and is almost always an early sign of Parkinson's or dementia, often preceding other symptoms by 10-15 years. That means it presents an unprecedented opportunity for developing therapies against Parkinson's disease or dementia and ultimately identifying those who would benefit from early prevention therapy.

However, RBD has been very difficult to diagnose.

""A simple screening question on whether or not people act out their dreams is poorly sensitive because many people with RBD rarely have full-blown dream enactment episodes but only have small twitches that they or their partners are not aware of,"" explained Mount Sinai clinician Dr. Emmanuel During.

During is associate professor of neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine, where he sees patients at The Mount Sinai Integrative Sleep Center and specializes in movement and sleep disorders, as well as pulmonary medicine and critical care.

Mount Sinai Health System is one of the largest academic medical systems in the New York metro area, with 48,000 employees working across eight hospitals, more than 400 outpatient practices, more than 600 research and clinical labs, a school of nursing, and a leading school of medicine and graduate education.

""A simple screening question also is poorly specific because more common conditions – like sleep apnea or a form of restless legs movements during sleep – can cause symptoms of dream-enactment mimicking RBD,"" During continued. ""RBD questionnaires lack accuracy.""

The gold standard test for diagnosing RBD is an in-lab sleep test in a sleep center, also known as a polysomnogram, which measures muscle activity (increased in RBD) during REM sleep using muscle sensors, or electromyography. 

But RBD has been very difficult to diagnose using this in-lab sleep test because it's very difficult to interpret and subject to artifacts, to the point that even sleep experts can disagree on the diagnosis.

""Notably, although a video camera records any movements during sleep, the current standard for interpreting the test does not take any of that into account, and no automated tool currently exists for interpreting video data,"" During noted. 

""In fact, in most sleep centers, the video data is discarded after the sleep test and only the rest of the data collected – EEG, breathing signals, EKG, etc. – will be stored.""

Furthermore, he said, unless a person undergoing a sleep test is specifically suspected to have RBD by their sleep specialist – based on a history of dream enactment – the diagnosis is easily missed because in 99% of cases, the test is conducted to evaluate for sleep apnea, which does not require assessing muscle activity,"" he added.

This leads to missing ""incidental cases"" of RBD, which occur in at least 1% of the adult population, according to studies. To address this need, the Mount Sinai research team developed a method for automating the diagnosis of RBD by analyzing video recordings of sleep during in-lab sleep tests.

PROPOSAL

The team developed an algorithm to automatically interpret the frequency and pattern of body movements detected during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and determine whether, based on these movements, a person has RBD or not.

This had been done only by one group in Austria, but their study used a particular research-grade 3-D camera, which required being added to the standard sleep test hardware.

""No study before ours had tested video data routinely collected with the 2-D-infrared camera used in all clinical sleep labs around the world,"" During said.

MEETING THE CHALLENGE

""We assembled a large dataset – larger than done in the prior study – comprising 81 sleep study recordings of patients with RBD (""cases"") and 91 without RBD (""controls""), including 63 with a range of other sleep disorders and 28 healthy sleepers,"" During explained.

An optical flow computer vision algorithm automatically detected movements during REM sleep, from which features of rate (frequency), ratio (proportion of time in REM sleep showing movements), magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility (a measure of the distribution pattern of movements in REM sleep) were extracted, he continued. From those five features, a machine-learning classifier was trained to differentiate RBD from other sleep conditions and normal sleep.

""We also were interested in testing the accuracy of the resulting classifier to detect RBD in patients who actually have RBD, but who, on the review of their sleep test, were not reported to move, based on manual review of video footages by a sleep expert,"" During recalled. ""A total of 11 such patients with RBD but no visible-with-the-human-eye movements were identified, and 71 patients with RBD with visible movements.""

RESULTS

The Mount Sinai team found, as they expected, that people with RBD exhibited an increased number of movements in REM sleep, particularly brief movements shorter than two seconds, including jerks or twitching known as myoclonus. Accuracies for detecting RBD ranged from 84.9% (with only two features) to 87.2% (with five features).

Combining all five features but only analyzing short (less than a 2-second duration) movements achieved the highest accuracy at 91.9%.

Of the 11 patients with RBD without noticeable movements during the sleep test, seven were correctly identified, or detected as having RBD, based on the Mount Sinai algorithm.

ADVICE FOR OTHERS

""This is the first study showing that a simple algorithm analyzing video recordings acquired during sleep tests, conducted under routine clinical care, can diagnose RBD and with a very high accuracy of 91.9%,"" During noted. ""This work improves prior frameworks by using a 2-D camera that is routinely used in sleep laboratories, and improving performance by adding only three features.

""This approach could be implemented in clinical sleep laboratories to facilitate and improve the diagnosis of RBD,"" he concluded. ""Coupled with automated detection of REM sleep, it should also be tested in the home environment, using conventional infrared cameras to detect and monitor RBD.""

Oops, something went wrong

Adventist Health Simi Valley has launched its newly designed clinic in the US to improve healthcare accessibility for the local community.

It hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the inauguration of the Sycamore Primary & Specialty Care Clinic.

This event was attended by members of the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce, local city officials, Adventist Health Simi Valley executives, and physicians affiliated with Adventist Health Medical Group.

The facility merges two previous clinics into a single location, offering extended access to speciality and primary care services.

Situated in Simi Valley, California, the clinic offers expanded operating hours to provide patients with improved flexibility, especially those requiring care outside traditional working hours.

Adventist Health Simi Valley president Alice Issai said: ""It's no coincidence that Adventist Health Simi Valley has been a trusted community resource for 60 years — we continually evolve to meet the needs of our neighbours.

""With this new clinic, we're taking a significant step toward ensuring that every patient receives timely, coordinated and compassionate care.""

The design of the clinic was informed by a six-month collaborative process involving physicians and staff from both former clinics, culminating in a space that lessens wait times, enhances patient flow, and improves care coordination.

Issai added: ""This clinic represents our ongoing commitment to keeping healthcare local, efficient and patient-centred.”

The 136-bed acute-care hospital Adventist Health Simi Valley, founded in 1965, serves the Ventura County area, including Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Moorpark and the west San Fernando Valley in the US.

The hospital and its five clinics offer a range of medical services, including robotic surgery, cardiology, neurology and stroke care, with a focus on patient safety.

In February 2024, Adventist Health entered a definitive agreement for the acquisition of two Tenet Healthcare hospitals and associated operations in San Luis Obispo County.

Concurrently, Tenet's Conifer Health Solutions subsidiary will provide revenue cycle services to Adventist Health.

""Adventist Health's new clinic in the US to improve healthcare access"" was originally created and published by Hospital Management, a GlobalData owned brand.

Settle brings four decades of experience in law, healthcare, government, and public policy

PHILADELPHIA, March 17, 2025 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Royer Cooper Cohen Braunfeld LLC (RCCB), a law firm known for its distinctive blend of business acumen, legal expertise, and entrepreneurial spirit, is proud to welcome Eric L. Settle, a highly regarded healthcare attorney with long experience in healthcare insurance, law, government and public policy. Mr. Settle joins RCCB as Senior Counsel to expand and enhance its healthcare transactional and regulatory practice within the Corporate & Business Group, further strengthening the firm's ability to navigate the evolving healthcare landscape. His deep industry knowledge and strong relationships will be instrumental in growing RCCB's presence in the healthcare sector.



With four decades of experience, Mr. Settle has held senior and chief counsel roles at leading health insurance companies, including Aetna, UnitedHealthcare, and AmeriHealth Caritas, a key subsidiary of Independence Blue Cross. He also served as Deputy General Counsel to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, overseeing health and environmental affairs, and was more recently appointed by Governor Josh Shapiro as part of the administration's Transition Advisory Committee for Health and Human Services, Healthcare Sub-Committee.

Beyond his legal career, Mr. Settle has been deeply involved in healthcare policy and advocacy, serving as a hospital trustee, leading the successful effort for the passage of Pennsylvania Act 62—which mandated insurance coverage for children with autism—and supporting disadvantaged children through his long-standing role with the Early Head Start Program at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Mr. Settle also spent five years as a wealth management executive at Alliance Bernstein. Most recently, he was recruited by the Forward Party, a new national centrist party led by Andrew Yang and Governor Christine Todd Whitman to run for Attorney General of Pennsylvania. His campaign was well received, and he earned over 18,000 votes in all 67 counties contributing to the advancement of the party's efforts.

""Eric's work and connections in the healthcare industry, law, government and public policy make him a tremendous asset to our firm and our clients,"" said Neil Cooper, Executive Partner of RCCB. ""Healthcare is a complex and rapidly evolving industry, and Eric's skills and experience will allow us to further service clients across the full spectrum of transactional and regulatory matters.""

Mr. Settle's work in healthcare law includes transactions, dispute resolution, regulatory compliance, value-based care models, and payer-provider partnerships. He played key roles in major healthcare mergers, including Aetna's acquisition of NY Life and Prudential Health's businesses, and played a lead role in structuring an innovative commercial health plan joint venture with Jefferson Health System on behalf of United Healthcare. His work in public affairs and consulting has positioned him as a trusted advisor to companies, investors, providers, payors, innovators, and government agencies navigating the evolving healthcare landscape.

Joining RCCB marks a return to private practice for Mr. Settle after three decades in government, corporate and public affairs roles. Encouraged by longtime friend and RCCB Executive Partner Mr. Cooper, he was drawn to the firm's dynamic growth, entrepreneurial culture, and commitment to providing innovative legal solutions.

""I've watched RCCB grow over the past decade and have been consistently impressed by the caliber of lawyers joining the firm. Many of them, like me, saw an opportunity to practice law in a better way,"" said Mr. Settle. ""After spending years advising businesses and policymakers, I realized I wanted to get back to practicing law and building something new. RCCB provides the perfect platform to launch a healthcare-focused practice that integrates regulatory expertise with corporate strategy.""

With Mr. Settle's addition, RCCB strengthens its ability to guide healthcare clients through transactions, regulatory compliance, and strategic partnerships. His hands-on roles with healthcare mergers, investments, and payer-provider collaborations provides RCCB clients with a distinct advantage.

""There are significant opportunities in healthcare today—whether through mergers, private equity investments, or innovative payer-provider collaborations,"" Mr. Settle noted. ""Having spent my career inside large healthcare organizations, I understand how these deals come together and how to navigate the regulatory complexities that come with them.""

Beyond his professional achievements, Mr. Settle remains deeply involved in philanthropy and community service. He served as President of Main Line Reform Temple and continues his service as a trustee and investment committee chair, leading the effort to create a permanent endowment, as well as a governing board member of the Early Head Start Program at CHOP.

NEW YORK, March 17, 2025

President Abdallah announces Trustee Debbane's largest gift in LAU's history for LAU Global.

NEW YORK, March 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of its commitment to support education and healthcare in Lebanon, the Lebanese American University (LAU) marked the beginning of a new century of service to the community in a Centennial Gala Dinner held on March 13, 2025, at the New York Public Library.



 



Proceeds from the fundraiser will go toward LAU's initiatives to foster industry in Lebanon, support financially challenged students and patients, and create an ever-giving legacy.

The university's continued efforts to help uplift the country are needed more than ever as Lebanon emerges from years of crises and embarks on rebuilding and renewal.

The event was attended by New York State Assemblymember Alex Bores, Lebanon's Ambassador to the United Nations Hadi Hachem, Permanent Representative of the State of Kuwait to the United Nations Ambassador Tareq Al-Bannai, Consul General of Lebanon in New York Majdi Ramadan, members of the Board of Trustees, LAU President Emeritus Joseph G. Jabbra, alumni, donors, and friends of LAU committed to upholding LAU's mission.

Welcoming the distinguished guests, the Chairman of the LAU Board of Trustees Philip Stoltzfus said: ""The Lebanese American University is a trusted institution for a simple reason: we always try to do the right thing, decade after decade, in times of crisis, in times of blessings. For a full century, for 100 years. It is not always easy and it is nearly always expensive, but acting this way is not a choice, it resides in our mission, the formative values of our founders, our sacred covenant with Lebanon.""

LAU President Chaouki T. Abdallah announced that LAU trustee Raymond Debbane and family were making the greatest gift in LAU's history to launch the university's global strategy and support its New York campus.

Expressing his gratitude to sponsors, donors and friends of LAU for their generosity and commitment to the university's mission, he said: ""Please join me in holding the gate of hope open for more students in Lebanon and around the world and thank you for helping us usher in the second century of LAU.""

Alumnus and CEO of Synopsys, Sassine Ghazi ('91) and three-time World Music Award winner and Arab pop icon Elissa were honored at the event; Ghazi for his lifetime achievements in innovation and excellence and Elissa for her advocacy of women's rights and brave fight against breast cancer.

Ghazi said: ""When I went to LAU in '88 I never imagined I would be here at its 100 anniversary. I love our country, and I love our heritage and our people.""

""Today, more than ever, our nation needs passionate leaders with access to education,"" said Elissa. ""It is our collective duty to nurture this hope and empower future generations to believe in themselves and dream so they can best represent Lebanon anywhere like yourselves.""

The evening was co-chaired by LAU trustees, H.H. Sheikha Intisar Al Sabah and Mr. Peter Tanous.

Private equity-backed healthcare companies are underperforming when it comes to preventing and responding to cyberattacks, according to a new report from Clearwater Security.

“Firms that proactively address cybersecurity can reduce liability, strengthen resilience, and not only protect but also accelerate revenue growth and create long-term value,” Clearwater CEO Steve Cagle said in a statement.

Nashville, TN-based company said it found “systemic gaps” in security preparedness among private equity-backed healthcare companies.

“Private equity firms need to consider the cybersecurity risk profiles of companies when deciding whether to acquire them or merge them with other businesses,” according to the report.

Cybersecurity weaknesses can threaten an entire portfolio, Clearwater found.

Using HHS' 405(d) Health Industry Cybersecurity Practices framework, the security company examined the top cybersecurity practices necessary to mitigate threats, such as:

The findings showed that many PE-backed healthcare companies lack a formalized incident response plan or rely on outdated procedures and that they do not conduct regular tabletop exercises, “leaving them unprepared for ransomware and system outages,” according to the report. In addition, the companies often lack organized recovery processes, which affect downtime and financial losses.

In addition, Clearwater noted weak data classification, inconsistent encryption and limited insider threat monitoring among the firms.

“Cybersecurity and resilience capabilities are creating winners and losers. Firms who are [making] cybersecurity a standard part of due diligence, perform ongoing risk analysis and align cybersecurity goals to their investment strategy are winning, as they are more competitive in the market while also avoiding costly breaches, regulatory penalties and post-acquisition surprises,” Cagle said. “We see winning private equity firms taking a proactive approach to ensuring their portcos [portfolio companies] have effective cyber risk management programs in place.”

The six guiding principles of using AI tools in healthcare. Credit: FUTURE-AI consortium

A new set of guidelines have been launched to create trustworthy AI systems in health care. The first of its kind, the FUTURE-AI guideline provides recommendations covering the entire lifecycle of medical AI, from design, development and validation to regulation, deployment, and monitoring.

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in health care, helping with tasks like disease diagnosis and predicting treatment outcomes. However, despite these advances, many health care professionals and patients are still hesitant to fully embrace AI technologies. This hesitation largely stems from concerns about trust, safety, and ethics.

In particular, existing research has shown that AI tools in health care can be prone to errors and patient harm, biases and increased health inequalities, lack of transparency and accountability, as well as data privacy and security breaches.

To overcome these challenges the FUTURE-AI Consortium has developed a comprehensive set of guidelines published in the BMJ. Developed by an international consortium of 117 experts from 50 countries the new guidelines called FUTURE-AI provide a roadmap for creating trustworthy and responsible AI tools for health care.

The FUTURE-AI guidelines are built around six guiding principles:

Gary Collins, Professor of Medical Statistics at the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS), University of Oxford, and author of FUTURE-AI said, ""These guidelines fill an important gap in the field of health care AI to give clinicians, patients, and health authorities the confidence to adopt AI tools knowing they are technically sound, clinically safe, and ethically aligned. The FUTURE-AI framework is designed to evolve over time, adapting to new technologies, challenges, and stakeholder feedback. This dynamic approach ensures the guidelines remain relevant and useful as the field of health care AI continues to rapidly advance.""

Researchers from the Viking Genes research project identified 108 genetic variants – differences in a person's DNA – in 23 genes, which can be linked to conditions like cancer and heart disease. These results were then communicated to participants, giving them the opportunity to undertake personalised treatment for their condition. Experts say it is one of the UK's first extensive efforts in returning clinically actionable genetic results to people involved in the study. 

These ground-breaking new results from the Viking Genes project underscore the critical role of genetic research in foreseeing and forestalling disease

After receiving a letter advising him of a variant in the BRCA2 gene, one volunteer underwent tests that showed he had prostate cancer. He underwent a successful operation in February to remove his prostate and is already back at work on his fishing boat. The research also revealed that 10 of these disease-causing variants were much more common in either Orkney or Shetland than elsewhere in the UK. Experts say the findings demonstrate the power of targeted genetic screening to help improve the health of people from isolated communities. 

Viking Genes, led by experts at the University of Edinburgh, is investigating the genetics and health of volunteers with at least two grandparents from the Hebrides, Shetland or Orkney. In this latest study, researchers analysed the genetic data of 4,198 participants and found small differences known to affect health in about 2.5% of them. 

NHS Grampian clinical genetics services verified the findings before 64 consenting participants were notified about their results, with experts adhering to recently introduced international guidelines developed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for returning genomic results. The study, which involved researchers the University of Aberdeen and the Regeneron Genetics Center, is published in the American Journal of Human Genetics and was funded by the Medical Research Council. The letters were funded by a Wellcome Trust Institutional Translational Partnership Award (iTPA), through the iTPA team at Edinburgh Innovations.    

""These ground-breaking new results from the Viking Genes project underscore the critical role of genetic research in foreseeing and forestalling disease,"" said Professor Jim Flett Wilson, Chair of Human Genetics at the University of Edinburgh. ""By tailoring our approach to fit specific genetic backgrounds, we can offer more precise, predictive, and preventative healthcare, thereby protecting communities, preserving health and saving lives. The results of this study provide a foundation for creating bespoke genetic screening programs for the Scottish Islanders and other unique genetic populations."" 

Since 2005, Viking Genes has recruited over 10,000 volunteers from the Northern and Western Isles of Scotland — regions known for their unique gene pools due to historical isolation and limited migration. This distinct genetic background provides a powerful tool to identify rare but medically significant genetic variants, experts say. It has previously identified clusters of rare breast and ovarian cancers in Shetland and Orkney involving the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.

Aged care provider halves staff turnover with automation

Not-for-profit aged care provider Southern Cross Care Queensland has modernised its workforce management processes amid reforms across the aged care sector. 

It recently implemented a suite of solutions from Humanforce, including for time and attendance, rostering and scheduling, and financial wellbeing, as well as an employee application. Based on a media release, the implementation resulted in reduced staff turnover, from 40% over the past four years to 17%. 

The 40-year-old aged care provider runs 13 homes and five retirement villages, manned by over 1,300 staff. The organisation needed to replace its previous rostering system, which was at its end of life, as it dealt with challenges posed by sector-wide reforms.

Free telehealth launched in Sydney

The state government of New South Wales has extended free virtual healthcare service to Sydney. 

The service, which can be accessed via HealthDirect, will provide care for urgent but non-life threatening conditions, including coughs, colds, and flu; respiratory symptoms; diarrhoea; and minor rashes. 

The NSW government expects the service to save 85,000 unnecessary waits in emergency departments each year.

Free telehealth has been part of government initiatives to address ED pressures. Over the past two years, free urgent virtual care services have been delivered to children and adults; telestroke and rural telehealth services have also been launched. 

Virtual hand therapy consults live in Western Australia

WA Country Health Service has started piloting a new virtual specialist hand therapy service. 

Running in two phases over 12 months, the pilot service will provide virtual co-consultations with local physicians and patients.

Based on a media release, co-consultation appointments will be booked following triage of e-referrals to the Telehands Clinic

The Radiation Oncology Case Rate (ROCR) Value Based Payment Program Act would stabilize access to radiation therapy and protect patient care across the country.

March 14, 2025 — Another pivotal milestone in the nation's fight against cancer recently took place with the reintroduction of bipartisan federal legislation to transform Medicare reimbursement for radiation therapy.

The Radiation Oncology Case Rate (ROCR) Value Based Payment Program Act of 2025, sponsored by Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.), John Joyce, MD (R-Pa.) and Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.), would protect access to high quality cancer care and improve outcomes for patients nationwide, while generating savings for Medicare.

The ROCR Act provides a patient-centered solution to modernize how Medicare reimburses radiation therapy services. By shifting away from the current quantity-based, per-treatment system to patient-focused, episode-based payments, ROCR prioritizes the quality and value of care provided — rather than the number of treatment visits. Passage of the ROCR Act would serve as an example of bipartisan congressional action toward value-based payment policy for America's health care system.

“The ROCR Act represents a balanced, evidence-based policy solution to safeguard access to high value cancer treatment for Americans, and it is the only viable policy solution designed to provide payment stability for the field of radiation oncology in 2026 and beyond,” said Howard M. Sandler, MD, FASTRO, Chair of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Board of Directors. “ASTRO applauds Sen. Tillis, Sen. Peters, Rep. Fitzpatrick, Rep. Panetta, Rep. Joyce and Rep. Tonko for championing a forward-thinking, patient-centered policy that keeps quality and value at the heart of cancer care.”

ROCR is broadly supported by more than 80 organizations representing a wide spectrum of radiation oncology stakeholders, including patient advocates, health professionals, small and large hospital systems, independent clinics and technology companies. Its introduction follows years of diminishing returns in the radiation oncology reimbursement landscape, marked by declining Medicare payments — with cuts totaling more than 25% since 2013 — as well as rising practice costs and an increase in the number of Americans needing cancer treatments. A recent study found that these and other factors have contributed to practice consolidation, with a 51% increase in large practices and 27% decrease in solo practices between 2015 and 2023.

Key features of the ROCR Act of 2025 include:

Patient specific episode-based payments that align financial incentives with guideline-driven care supported by science

Encouraging the adoption of evidence-based shorter treatments when they are clinically determined to be in the patient's best interest, minimizing physical and financial burdens on patients

Strengthening quality and safety standards by incentivizing practice accreditation and supporting new technologies for patient care

Targeted support to tackle transportation barriers that keep patients from completing their radiation treatments

Unifying technical payments across hospital and freestanding/community practice settings

Generating millions of dollars in Medicare savings while ensuring that more than a million Americans who receive radiation therapy for cancer each year maintain access to the best possible treatment

“The ROCR Act modernizes Medicare's payment system to ensure cancer patients receive the best care possible,” said Sen. Tillis. “Current reimbursement policies reward quantity over quality, making it harder for physicians to provide the tailored, high-quality care cancer patients deserve. This bipartisan bill fixes this by shifting to a fair, bundled payment model that removes incentives for longer treatments, supports innovation, and ensures continued access to world-class care.”

“Radiation oncology is a highly effective tool for fighting certain cancers, but outdated Medicare reimbursement policies prevent many Americans from being able to utilize this treatment,” said Sen. Peters. “I'm proud to help lead this bipartisan bill that would reduce barriers to this essential care for cancer patients and ensure oncologists can prescribe the best treatment available for their patients.”

ROCR builds on lessons learned from the indefinitely delayed Medicare Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model (RO Model), which offered changes but failed to adequately address stakeholders' concerns. The bipartisan ROCR bill incorporates the RO Model's strengths, namely the use of episode-based payments to support patient-centric care, while addressing shortcomings such as mandated cuts and burdensome reporting requirements. ROCR was introduced last year in the previous Congress by Sen. Tillis and Reps. Fitzpatrick, Panetta, Joyce and Tonko, with 10 additional members of Congress joining as cosponsors.

ASTRO urges all members of Congress to support this bill and help usher in a new era of evidence-backed, bipartisan policy solutions to safeguard Americans' access to high quality, high value cancer treatment in their communities.

Toyota's long-term strategy on the advancement of a hydrogen-powered society took center stage at the recent 2025 Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Seminar as executives presented and outlined the company's vision and plan for achieving carbon neutrality.

“We are collaborating with companies that would traditionally have been our competition to develop standards for hydrogen fueling connections and protocols, recognizing that an industry standard was of greater benefit than our own competitive advantage,” said Jay Sackett, Toyota's chief engineer of advanced mobility, according to a Toyota press release.

Many of Toyota's public-facing efforts toward decarbonization have focused on hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric powertrains; however, Toyota says its hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles and powertrains remain an important part of its multi-pathway strategy.

Toyota believes hydrogen can play a role in the transition to a carbon-neutral future, particularly in sectors with significant carbon footprints, such as heavy-duty trucking, the release states.

An example shared at the event was how Toyota's largest port vehicle processing center in the U.S., located at the Port of Long Beach, which processes upward of 200,000 vehicles per year, has applied the technology. With FuelCell Energy, Toyota built the first-of-its-kind Tri-gen system at the port.

“The system was designed to use directed renewable biogas and convert it to hydrogen, which is then used to produce 2.3 megawatts of electricity per day, part of which is used to power Toyota Logistic Services' port operations,” the release states. “Some of the hydrogen produced by the system, up to 1,200 kg per day, is pumped to two adjacent stations, providing fuel for heavy-duty trucks and light-duty passenger vehicles.

“The third product of the facility is water. Tri-gen produces 1,400 gallons of water a day as a byproduct of the electricity generated by hydrogen — the Toyota team members use the water to wash vehicles when they come off shipping vessels. The system offsets 9,000 tons of CO₂ emissions per year from the Long Beach community.”

The port has about 30 fuel cell EV trucks in its rotation, all of which can take hydrogen produced from Tri-gen.



“While this is a small start, given the more than 20,000 heavy-duty truck routes operating daily in the area, including both the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, Toyota sees a substantial opportunity to replace conventional diesel trucks with zero-emission, hydrogen-powered alternatives,” the release states.

FCEV trucks are capable of not only matching the payload capacity of their diesel counterparts but also allow greater up-time for drivers through significantly quicker refueling times than pure battery EV commercial trucks — 15 to 20 minutes for a full fuel cell tank versus 90 minutes on the quickest chargers available for a 90% battery charge — and emit only water vapor.

Toyota noted that it launched the world's first mass-produced hydrogen FCEV, the Toyota Mirai, in 2014.

“That vehicle showed that Toyota's polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell stack could reliably convert hydrogen into electricity to power passenger vehicles,” the release states. “Those vehicles — and the millions of miles they've traversed in the ensuing decade — were only the start. Now, Toyota has shown that there are other use applications and cases to be found with the versatility and scalability of fuel cells.”

H2HQ, Toyota's North American hydrogen headquarters in Gardena, California, has been co-developing the technology with Toyota Motor Corp. in Japan, from the earliest fuel cells and semi-truck applications to mobile and stationary generators, replacing diesel-powered generators in several applications, according to the release.

Thibaut de Barros Conti, general manager of fuel cell solutions, touched on how a Toyota fuel-cell-based generator is already in use as a backup generator in a hospital in the Pacific Northwest. On a smaller scale, a mobile generator built into a Toyota Tundra by TRD North America for motorsports and marketing activations was used to power the Hot Cocoa Village and Santa's Workshop, presented by Lexus, at last year's Detroit Christmas tree lighting.



On a much larger scale, a 1-Megawatt proton exchange membrane fuel cell power generation system using Toyota's fuel cells was installed at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado, and a future microgrid at H2HQ includes fuel cells in its design to enhance energy resilience.

Despite advancements in hydrogen technology, de Barros Conti said challenges still remain in the creation of a hydrogen society, including a limited number of stations available. Toyota has been taking steps to address the infrastructure gap in California, the release states.

As Toyota continues to innovate and expand its hydrogen initiatives, the company is committed to decarbonizing its logistics and trucking fleet, integrating hydrogen solutions where they make sense.

Calling upon the audience for collaboration, de Barros Conti expressed optimism.

“This has not been an easy road but it is the right road,” he said.

March 17, 2025





Belgian offshore installation contractor Jan De Nul, in consortium with Greek cables supplier Hellenic Cables has signed a framework agreement with National Grid for strategic HVDC interconnections in the U.K.

This agreement will entitle the consortium to participate in upcoming tenders for call-off projects for the design, manufacturing, supply, installation, testing, and commissioning of HVDC cable systems as part of National Grid's large-scale offshore and onshore transmission infrastructure investment program.

The deal, which has an initial term of five years with an option for extension of up to three additional years, is a key component of National Grid's strategy to secure long-term partnerships that support deliverability for critical projects in the UK.

The U.K. Government's commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2050 has placed significant emphasis on expanding the country's electricity grid infrastructure to integrate renewable energy sources, such as offshore wind.

National Grid's cable framework aims to support this transition, ensuring a robust and reliable energy network, and this framework will play a crucial role in enhancing grid resilience, facilitating renewable energy integration and ensuring energy security for the future.

The consortium will participate in potential future tenders for turnkey projects.

“We are proud to partner with National Grid through this framework for strategic HVDC interconnections. The agreement confirms our position as World Builders of the energy transition through providing vital power cable links,” said Wouter Vermeersch, Director Subsea Cables Offshore Energy at Jan De Nul.

“This agreement strengthens our commitment to supporting the UK's energy transition and offshore wind ambitions. We are proud to be part of this critical framework, providing world-class HVDC cable solutions,” added Kostas Savvakis, General Manager, Hellenic Cables.

Cleary Gottlieb has acquired Springbok AI, bringing aboard the generative AI-focused legal technology company's founder and a 10-person team.

The rare law firm acquisition of a technology company—Cleary declined to say how much it's spending on the deal—comes as Big Law grapples with how to apply generative AI solutions to client work. Law firms are boosting their investment in technology tools by hiring data scientists to build internal applications and buying new software products.

Cleary's acquisition of Springbok and its data scientists combines both of the “buy versus build” strategies. The company has developed generative AI tools used by other major law firms, including Dentons and Hogan Lovells, according to previous reports. The Springbok team now will work exclusively with Cleary's lawyers.

“What Springbok will allow us to do is tailor and customize off-the-shelf products to the specific use cases that our clients are interested in,” Cleary's managing partner Michael Gerstenzang said in an interview. “That takes a particular level of technological capability and sophistication.”

Founded in 2017, Springbok has rolled out generative AI products like a chatbot that it says allow law firms to run searches on documents or compare terms across documents with little to no input from technologists. The tools, underpinned by large language models, have been customized by law firms for specific practices and contract management.

Springbok also provided consultancy services, including for Dentons on the 2023 lunch of the “fleetAI” product, according to a report by a legal technology publication. 

Cleary was exploring working with Springbok when it struck the deal to buy the company, said Ilona Logvinova, the law firm's director of practice innovation.

“They are forming a new capability within our firm,” she said. 

Bloomberg Law sells legal research tools and software, including some that make use of GenAI.

Gerstenzang is among the more vocal Big Law leaders supporting the adoption of generative AI, which he expects to bring “massive change” to law firms.

The technology could help law firms move away from the billable hour and also reduce the advantage of “brute force” held by the world's largest law firms, he told Bloomberg Law in late 2023. 

Technologists will play a greater role at law firms moving forward, Gerstenzang said in an interview regarding the Springbok deal,and technology spending will become a larger line item on his firm's budget.

Unlike traditional technology spending, he said the firm's investments in generative AI will generate a significant return. He also acknowledged it's unclear when that return will happen—“maybe” in the near term, but “certainly” in the medium to long-term.

The billable hour will become “completely antiquated” once generative AI is doing significant work. “That is all for the good in terms of law firms and clients,” Gerstenzang said, since the value delivered by more efficient products won't be captured by charging for time.

The rise of generative AI has also prompted concerns that younger lawyers will be replaced. Paul Weiss chair Brad Karp stoked those fears last month when he said junior lawyers could be “significantly replaced” by technologists and data scientists in the future.

Gerstenzang offered a different view.

Lawyers who don't use technology will be replaced by those who do, he said, but that doesn't mean the technology will reduce the overall number of attorneys.

“It is a mistake to say there's only so much legal work and either humans or computers will do it,” Gerstenzang said. “What I don't think is the case is that law firms won't need associates anymore because they'll have machines.”

The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are warning against a dangerous ransomware scheme.In an advisory posted earlier this week, government officials warned that a ransomware-as-a-service software called Medusa, which has launched ransomware attacks since 2021, has recently affected hundreds of people.

Medusa uses phishing campaigns as its main method for stealing victims' credentials, according to CISA. To protect against the ransomware, officials recommended patching operating systems, software and firmware, in addition to using multifactor authentication for all services such as email and VPNs.

Experts also recommended using long passwords, and warned against frequently recurring password changes because they can weaken security. Medusa developers and affiliates — called “Medusa actors” — use a double extortion model, where they “encrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid,” the advisory said.

Medusa operates a data-leak site that shows victims alongside countdowns to the release of information. “Ransom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets,” the advisory said.

“At this stage, Medusa concurrently advertises sale of the data to interested parties before the countdown timer ends. Victims can additionally pay $10,000 USD in cryptocurrency to add a day to the countdown timer.”

Since February, Medusa developers and affiliates have hit more than 300 victims across industries, including the medical, education, legal, insurance, technology and manufacturing sectors, CISA said.

Download the app:

Platform X, formerly known as Twitter, suffered multiple outages on March 10.

Thousands of X users in the US and UK reported being unable to access the app throughout the day.

It is reported that owner Elon Musk attributed the outages to a ""massive cyberattack"" and claimed that ""IP addresses originating from the Ukraine area"" were behind it.

With reported issues peaking at 40,000 on Downdetector, the extent of the outage is beyond doubt.

It is the most significant service outage the platform has suffered in years, with the effects of the outage lasting for several hours.

But what exactly caused the outage?

Here are the original theories, followed by the opinions of cybersecurity experts.

Claim: Ukraine-based hackers were behind the cyberattack on X

After X's interruption, question marks remain over its cause – and who could be behind it, writes yahoonews, the Telegraph reports.

Elon Musk continues to claim that behind him is ""a large, coordinated group with IP addresses from the Ukraine area.""

Reality: it is impossible to determine the true source of the attack on X

Analysts across the web are broadly united in their understanding that X suffered a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.

This is traditionally a fairly crude form of cyberattack.

It floods a target's servers, exceeding their capacity and preventing real users from accessing the website in question.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ciaran Martin – a professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government and former head of the UK's National Cyber ​​Security Centre – described the technique as ""not that sophisticated"".

Some experts suggest the opposite.

David Mound said in a statement that ""DDoS attack tactics have evolved dramatically.""

He noted that ""attackers now distribute traffic across entire subnets.""

It is reported that some experts have pointed out that DDoS attacks are usually orchestrated using a battalion of devices across the globe.

Traffic tends to be generated from IP addresses that are distributed across different regions, making it difficult to pinpoint where the attack originated.

Speaking to Wired, Shawn Edwards, chief security officer of Zayo, a network connectivity company, said that ""attackers often use compromised devices, VPNs or proxy networks to obscure their true origins.""

As a result, it is difficult to determine the true source of an attack.

However, even if it comes from a specific country, as Musk suggested, that doesn't mean the cyberattackers were based in that country.

Incidentally, Wired quoted an anonymous researcher who stated that none of the 20 main sources involved in the attack were located in Ukraine.

If correct, this would contradict Musk's statement regarding Ukrainian hackers.

Otherwise, there appears to be no evidence behind his claim that the IP addresses involved in the attack originated in Ukraine.

But, this does not mean that a state actor could not be involved.

Another question is how the attack was able to affect X significantly.

DDoS attacks are relatively common, with Musk himself announcing that X is “attacked every day.”

So why did this attack bring down X?

Musk is keen to suggest that a group with vast resources is behind him.

However, a number of independent analysts have identified that the platform's servers were not properly secured, leaving them publicly exposed to attack. /Telegraph/

BYD is also starting to set the pace in advanced driver-assistance technology.

BYD unveiled a new system for electric cars that the Chinese automaker says will allow them to charge almost as fast as it takes a regular car to refuel.

BYD's new battery and charging system was capable of providing 470 kilometers (292 miles) of range in five minutes in tests on its new Han L sedan, Chairman and founder Wang Chuanfu said Monday.

Being able to charge a car in the time it takes a combustion engine vehicle to pull in and out of a gas station could convince drivers who aren't willing to make lengthy stops to go electric. 

The new system, which will underpin many of its future electric vehicles, could provide another boost for BYD, which has come from behind to rival Tesla Inc. as the world's top EV seller. 

The speeds would be comfortably ahead of Tesla's Superchargers, which can add up to 275 kilometers of range in 15 minutes. Tesla, however, has a much larger network of more than 65,000 Superchargers worldwide. Mercedes-Benz Group AG's new entry-level CLA electric sedan unveiled last week can add 325 kilometers in 10 minutes of charging.

BYD's new EV platform will allow cars to reach 100 kilometers per hour in two seconds, Wang said at the event at the company's headquarters in Shenzhen.

This is BYD “elevating the game to another dimension,” Lei Xing, an independent China autos analyst, said.

BYD has had a stellar start to 2025. The company, which only makes hybrid and fully electric cars, sold more than 318,000 passenger vehicles last month, up 161 percent from a year earlier. It's the top carmaker in China, the world's biggest auto market, with a share approaching 15 percent. BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares, which were little changed on Monday, are up about 45 percent this year.

An advanced EV powertrain could further boost demand for BYD's next-generation cars, said Joanna Chen, a China autos analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “This could mark the beginning of a new wave of model rollouts, propelling BYD's battery-electric vehicle sales to catch up with hybrids after they fell behind in 2024,” she said.

BYD is also starting to set the pace in advanced driver-assistance technology. The company earlier this year said that it's taking this to the masses by including features like lane-keeping and adaptive cruise control in some of its cheapest models.

BYD's Super e-Platform may also pose a competitive threat to Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., currently the world's largest manufacturer of EV batteries. Li Auto Inc., for example, is using one of CATL's latest generation batteries to enable charging that gives 500 kilometer of range in 12 minutes.

The OnePlus 13 is primarily known for its Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered performance, Hasselblad-tuned cameras, and OxygenOS 15. However, the latest flagship from OnePlus offers much more than just these highlights. In fact, some of its lesser-known features are so handy that they elevate the user experience, making the OnePlus 13 an even more compelling flagship offering than it was perceived to be.

Here are five such features that every OnePlus 13 (review) user—and those considering getting one—must know:

The OnePlus 13 is the first smartphone from the brand to support eSIM in India. Unlike most phones with eSIM—especially from brands like Google and Apple, which offer a single physical SIM slot along with eSIM support—the OnePlus 13 includes two physical nano SIM card slots in addition to eSIM support. However, when using an eSIM, the secondary physical SIM card will be automatically disabled, meaning the phone can only accommodate two SIM cards at a time.

The OnePlus 13 is one of the first Android smartphones in the world that can be tracked even when turned off. This feature, which has been available on iPhones for a while, allows users to locate their device via Google's Find My network even when it is powered down. This can be especially useful in case of theft, as owners can continue tracking their phones.

The OnePlus 13 can function as a walkie-talkie, thanks to a feature called BeanLink. This allows the device to connect with other OnePlus and Oppo smartphones without requiring an internet connection, enabling users to make calls and send messages. Although it has a limited range, this feature can be highly useful in scenarios such as trekking or in areas with weak network coverage.

This feature ensures that the OnePlus 13 remains responsive even when the screen is wet. Combined with support for gloves mode, it makes the phone easy to use in extreme conditions. Simply put, the display on the OnePlus 13 will stay active and responsive in almost any environment.

Last but not least, the alert slider is a signature hardware feature on the OnePlus 13. However, this is likely to be the last OnePlus smartphone to include it, as the brand plans to replace it with a programmable button similar to the Action Button on the iPhone 16. The alert slider makes it easy to switch between different sound profiles without needing to turn on the screen.

The Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited has introduced a youth empowerment initiative targeting the North-West region of Nigeria. The programme aims to equip participants with advanced technological skills and improve broadband access in remote areas.

The initiative, featuring a Space-Tech Hackathon and Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) training, is scheduled to take place in Dutse, Jigawa, from April 7 to 11.

In a statement issued in Abuja, Aisha Bantam, NIGCOMSAT's Head of Corporate Affairs, confirmed that the programme is designed to engage university students, start-ups, and local innovators from Kaduna, Kano, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Katsina, and Jigawa states.

Interested participants can register via the official link: https://bit.ly/VSAT_JIGAWA.

NIGCOMSAT previously organised a similar programme in the North-East, hosting a regional Space-Tech Hackathon in Yola, Adamawa State, from February 24 to 28. That event, co-hosted with the Adamawa State Government, focused on grassroots innovation in satellite technology, driving economic and social impact.

Providing further details, NIGCOMSAT's Managing Director, Jane Egerton-Idehen, highlighted that the five-day event would offer mentorship and hands-on experience in satellite technology.

“The hackathon provides participants with a platform to identify challenges, generate ideas, develop prototypes, and receive expert mentorship,” she explained.

She also announced that the winning team from the hackathon would be enrolled in the NIGCOMSAT Accelerator Programme Cohort 2025, where they will receive further support to develop and implement their projects.

Beyond the hackathon, Egerton-Idehen revealed that 100 youths will receive specialised training in VSAT installation, a crucial technology for expanding broadband access in underserved communities.

Egerton-Idehen reiterated that the overarching goal of the initiative is to inspire technological innovation, tackle community challenges, and reduce youth unemployment across Nigeria.

She also confirmed that the North-West Hackathon and VSAT training will be jointly hosted by Jigawa State and NIGCOMSAT Ltd.

U.S. immigration authorities arrested and interrogated a German national who is a legal permanent U.S. resident at Boston Logan International Airport on March 7, according to the man's mother and his partner. Three days later, law enforcement officers took him to a hospital before he was transferred to a federal detention facility.

Fabian Schmidt, 34, is now being held at the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls, Rhode Island, according to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement online database. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In an emailed statement Monday, an assistant commissioner of public affairs at U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said: “If statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.”

“Due to federal privacy regulations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection cannot disclose details about specific cases,” said the assistant commissioner, Hilton Beckham.

Astrid Senior, Schmidt's mother, said in a phone interview Monday that her son contacted her March 11, four days after he was scheduled to land in Boston. She said that she and her son moved to the U.S. from Germany in 2007 and received green cards in 2008. He lives in New Hampshire and renewed his legal permanent resident status last year, she said.

Senior said she has no idea why her son is being detained by U.S. immigration officials. She said her son, who once lived in California, faced misdemeanor charges roughly a decade ago. He has no active legal or court issues, Senior said. 

“I feel helpless. Absolutely helpless,” Senior said.

Senior and Schmidt's partner, Bhavani Hodgkins, confirmed the family has retained a lawyer to work on his case. The lawyer, David Keller, did not immediately respond to an email and text message requesting more information Monday.

In recent weeks, President Donald Trump's administration has ramped up border enforcement and moved to tighten immigration policies. Schmidt's case raises questions about how federal immigration officials will treat people who are permanent legal residents.

The news of Schmidt's arrest and detention was first reported by GBH, a Boston area public television station.

Senior, who also lives in New Hampshire, said Schmidt called her from the ICE facility on March 11 and provided his account of events leading up to his detention. She said she has not heard from him since.

Schmidt, an electrical engineer, recently traveled to Germany for seven days to visit family and flew into Boston Logan from Luxembourg on March 7, Senior said.

Hodgkins was supposed to pick him up and drive him back to the home in Nashua they share with their child, who is a U.S. citizen. Hodgkins called the authorities when he did not appear after several hours, Senior said.

Senior said Schmidt told her that he was interrogated at the airport, though she declined to provide specifics. He required medical attention at some point during the interrogation and he was taken  to Massachusetts General Hospital, Senior said.

Benjamin Crawley, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Port Authority, which owns and operates Boston Logan, said in an email: “We don't have any information on this case.” He referred NBC News to CBP.

In an emailed statement, Sgt. Gregory Jones of the Massachusetts State Police said authorities dispatched a trooper to a medical call at the customs hall in Boston Logan's Terminal E shortly before 8 a.m. on March 10.

“Boston EMS also responded and determined that the individual required transport to a local hospital,” Jones said. CBP personnel “accompanied the individual to the hospital as they were not able to process the individual through customers prior to the transport.” 

Mass General's press office did not immediately respond to an email seeking information about Schmidt.

In an email, a German official at the German embassy in Washington, D.C., said it was “aware of the case and has been in close contact about it with the relevant U.S. authorities as well as the family of the concerned person.”

“We kindly ask for your understanding that for reasons of privacy and data protection laws, we cannot provide any further details on the case,"" the official said. ""Considering the procedures of the Customs and Border authorities, please refer to the relevant U.S. authorities.""

Fox News correspondent Brooke Taylor reports on the busy holiday travel season on ‘Special Report.'

President Donald Trump on Sunday sent the National Guard to tornado-struck Arkansas after tornadoes and heavy winds ripped through multiple states over the weekend, leaving at least 37 dead.

Heavy winds tore through the Heartland on Saturday, threatening Missouri, Mississippi, Kansas, Arkansas, Texas and Oklahoma with tornadoes, damaging buildings and homes. Northern states, including South Dakota and Minnesota, faced blizzard warnings.

""We are actively monitoring the severe tornadoes and storms that have impacted many States across the South and Midwest — 36 innocent lives have been lost, and many more devastated,"" Trump said in a Sunday post on X. 

""The National Guard have been deployed to Arkansas, and my Administration is ready to assist State and Local Officials, as they help their communities to try and recover from the damage. Please join Melania and me in praying for everyone impacted by these terrible storms!"" the president wrote.

The National Guard tweeted that its Arkansas officers will ""support civilian authorities providing security and humanitarian assistance in communities affected by tornadoes in central and eastern Arkansas.""

Here are the number of deaths by state so far:

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said there were about 50 National Guardsmen and 40 state police on the ground in Arkansas on Sunday.

""As you drive through this community, you see so many neighbors coming out, taking care of each other,"" she said in a video posted to X. ""One of the things that will make you so proud as a governor is to see neighbors helping neighbors, and never is that more true than right here in this community today. We've got about 40 state police on the ground in the county, about 50 National Guard.""

Missouri resident Dakota Henderson told The Associated Press that he and some others helped rescue neighbors trapped beneath rubble on Friday evening and found five bodies in the process.

A majority of American voters say their sympathies lie more with Ukraine than Russia in the war between the two countries. At the same time, nearly half say they think President Donald Trump favors Russia, while most of the remainder believe he favors neither, according to the new national NBC News poll.

Sixty-one percent of registered voters choose Ukraine when asked which of the two countries has their sympathies more, while just 2% say Russia. Another 35% say they are more sympathetic to neither side, while 2% are not sure.

When asked where they believe Trump's sympathies are, 49% choose Russia, 40% say they think Trump favors neither side, and 8% choose Ukraine. Another 3% say they are not sure.

Trump himself has publicly adopted the idea of not favoring either side, saying in February, “If I didn't align myself with both of them, you'd never have a deal.”

“I cannot recall a moment in history when American public opinion and voters' views of a president, as to which country they are more aligned with, have been more in conflict with each other,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey along with GOP pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.

Those whose personal sympathies lie more with Ukraine are more likely to be Democrats (88% of them chose Ukraine), independents (59%) and those with higher levels of education and income. But majorities across a handful of key demographic cross-sections — gender, age and race — all backed Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia in 2022. Hispanic voters are close to evenly divided between Ukraine and “neither side.” 

The key split is on political lines, with Republican and conservative-leaning voters more likely to say their sympathies lie with neither nation. Among Republicans, 57% say they favor neither side.

But there are some notable splits within the GOP. For example, 53% of college-educated Republicans say their sympathies lie more with Ukraine, while 62% of Republicans without a college degree say their sympathies lie with neither country.

On the question of how voters view Trump's positioning on Ukraine and Russia, majorities of Democrats, independents, suburban women, voters of color and voters across all age ranges (except ages 50-64) all believe Trump is more sympathetic to Russia.

Among Republicans, 70% say Trump is not more sympathetic to either nation. Another 14% say Trump is more sympathetic to Russia, and 13% say he's more sympathetic to Ukraine.

Trump's handling of the war between Ukraine and Russia has been one of the major storylines of the early months of his second term. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly pledged he would end the war quickly upon taking office, but the situation has proved to be more complicated as efforts to reach a ceasefire continue. And it's clear America's posture toward the two sides has changed in the new administration.

While then-President Joe Biden heaped praise on Ukraine for defending itself against Russia's incursion and repeatedly trumpeted new aid packages to the country, Trump has been more critical toward Ukraine, culminating in a heated confrontation between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in front of reporters in the Oval Office late last month.

During the discussion, Trump declared that Zelenskyy was “gambling with the lives of millions of people” and had been “disrespectful” to the U.S., while Vance argued the Ukrainian president hadn't been thankful enough for the help his country received. The episode scuttled plans to sign an agreement on mineral rights in Ukraine, and the Trump administration moved to pause intelligence sharing and aid to Ukraine in the days after the meeting, though both restarted last week after talks in Saudi Arabia.

These developments come amid a broader philosophical shift among Republicans toward Trump's brand of “America First” foreign policy, while Democrats have pulled in the opposite direction.

In the poll, voters heard two statements and picked which one better represents their thinking: The U.S. “need to focus here at home because America cannot be the world's policeman trying to solve all the problems and intervening in countries around the world,” or “America has not been strong enough and has allowed Russia and China to extend their influence and power throughout the world?”

In March 2022, Republicans were split: 47% chose focus here at home and 46% said America hasn't been strong enough on the international stage. 

Now, 61% want America to focus here at home while 33% say it hasn't been strong enough on the world stage. Democrats have moved in the opposite direction, from 49%-40% on focusing at home in 2022 to 57%-37% now that America hasn't been strong enough internationally.

Overall, 51% of American voters prefer to focus here at home and 43% say that America hasn't been strong enough on the world stage. That's similar to three years ago, when 50% said focus at home and 41% said America hasn't been strong enough on the world stage.

Republicans' evolution on U.S. foreign policy also includes increasingly negative views of NATO over the last few years. Trump has long criticized NATO countries for not spending enough to defend the alliance and said the U.S. has been unfairly shouldering the load.

In 2022, 39% of Republicans had a positive view of the military alliance among the U.S., Canada and 30 European countries, while 22% had a negative view of it. Now, 19% view NATO positively and 46% view it negatively.

Fifty-five percent of registered voters disapprove of Trump's handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, while 42% approve of it.

When asked to evaluate the kind of change Trump is bringing to America's handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, 41% of registered voters say Trump is bringing the right kind of change, 34% say he is bringing the wrong kind and 22% say he isn't bringing any change.

And U.S. voters give Ukraine and Zelenskyy far higher positive marks than Russian President Vladimir Putin and his country. Forty-six percent of voters say they view Zelenskyy favorably and 32% view him negatively, close to the 41% who view Ukraine positively and 28% who view the country negatively.

Just 6% view Russia positively and 68% view it negatively, while 3% view Putin positively and 84% view him negatively.

While Democratic views on Zelenskyy and Ukraine have largely stayed similar since NBC News polling measured them in May 2022, Republicans have less positive views of Zelenskyy and Ukraine than they did previously. Negative views of Russia and Putin have also declined among Republicans, though positive views have not moved appreciably.

A plurality of Republicans, 37%, viewed Ukraine negatively in November 2023, while 27% viewed the country positively. But the nation's lost support from the party since then, and now 46% view it negatively and 19% view it positively.

“The president is creating an alignment with his own political base,” said McInturff, the Republican pollster.

“You're watching a shift,” McInturff continued. “He is dragging his own political base in terms of his current rhetoric and position.”

The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news","Why are Trump supporters claiming he wants to crash the US stock market?","https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/17/why-are-trump-supporters-claiming-he-wants-to-crash-the-us-stock-market","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 11:50:16 GMT","

Some MAGA followers are spreading an unsubstantiated theory related to the cost of the US national debt.

The US stock market has had a bumpy ride since United States President Donald Trump's election in November.

After hitting record highs in the aftermath of Trump's victory, US stocks have shed trillions of dollars amid his dizzying back-and-forth announcements on tariffs and growing fears of a recession.

While Trump has played down the turbulence as a temporary “period of transition” on the road to a stronger economy, supporters and critics of the US president alike have speculated without evidence that he may be trying to crash the stock market on purpose.

Trump's vacillating economic policies have created uncertainty – something investors famously dislike.

The benchmark S&P500, which tracks the performance of 500 of the biggest US firms, has lost nearly $5 trillion in value from its February 19 peak.

On March 10, the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 4 percent – its worst single-day drop since September 2022.

Regardless of whether Trump is playing the long game as he claims, the past month “stands out for both the amount of uncertainty and the variety of fronts”, Tara Sinclair, director of the George Washington University Center for Economic Research, told Al Jazeera.

The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis produces based on news coverage of economic policy-related issues, in February hit its highest level since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

The Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index in January reached its highest point on record apart from May 2020.

There are several unsubstantiated theories about why Trump might want to crash the stock market, but chief among them is that he is trying to make it easier to pay off the US's $36 trillion national debt by lowering interest rates.

Since taking office, Trump has both expressed concern about the size of the debt and called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.

In a recent interview with FOX News, he claimed that “nobody ever gets rich when the interest rates are high, because people can't borrow money.”

With a debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio of about 120 percent, the federal debt is approaching its highest level since the end of World War II.

It is also expensive to pay off – the US government last year spent more than $1 trillion on interest payments alone.

 



 

Some Trump supporters have claimed that he is intentionally trying to induce economic pain to force the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would make it cheaper to refinance the national debt.

“Trump is setting up a stock market crash. The US government needs to refinance $7 trillion in debt over the next 6 months,” crypto influencer and investor Thomas Kralow, who has more than 500,000 YouTube followers, said on X last week.

“Trump doesn't want this done at current 10-year yields. This is why he's letting the stock market drop while pushing bond prices higher,” Kralow said, adding this would create “short term pain, long term gain”.

While the Federal Reserve makes its decisions independent of the White House and US Congress, it typically lowers the cost of borrowing during difficult economic conditions in order to stimulate growth.

When interest rates go down, the government also pays out lower yields on US Treasury bonds – essentially a type of loan to the government – thereby reducing the cost of interest paid on outstanding debt.

If bond yields were to come down, the US government would be able to pay substantially lower interest payments on the debt that needs refinancing, which is expected to amount to some $9 trillion in 2025, according to an estimate by Axel Funhoff, a professor at the Antwerp Management School in Belgium.

“For the better part of a decade, the US benefitted from historically low interest rates. These lower rates enabled the government to finance its debt at rates around 2.7 percent,” Funhoff said in a LinkedIn post in January.

Compared with that era of cheap borrowing, current interest rates are much higher: The yields on 10-year Treasury bonds and 5-year Treasury bonds stood at 4.3 percent and 4 percent, respectively, on Friday.

 



 

A different theory circulating among some Trump critics suggests that he is deliberately tanking the stock market to reward himself and his supporters, including conservative Wall Street investors and MAGA-supporting Silicon Valley CEOs.

Proponents of this theory claim that Trump induced a market tumble so that he and his allies can “buy the dip” – in other words, buy stocks at a discount before the market bounces back.

“[Trump] is purposely manipulating the stock markets …. Tariff scare, markets go down his rich buddies buy the dip, afterwards tariff off, stock market goes back up, said rich friends get richer… He needs to be investigated,” X user AKASabraFella said last week.

While the Trump administration has played down the turmoil in the markets, it has not given any indication that it actually wants the stock prices to go down.

Indeed, Trump has in the past often boasted about the performance of stocks on his watch when the market has been bullish.

Kathleen Brooks, the founder of market analysis company Minerva Analysis, said she did not believe Trump was purposely trying to cause the market to drop.

“The US economy peaked in November and since then US economic data has been trending lower and surprisingly on the downside. This means that the bond market had to play catch-up,” Brooks told Al Jazeera, adding that other assets like Bitcoin have also fallen from their peak.

“It is not unusual for markets to move in unison like this. This undermines the view that the moves in the Treasury market are a conspiracy theory. Instead, there are good fundamental reasons for the decline,” she said.

Some market analysts have also suggested that the market is overvalued and long overdue a correction – Wall Street lingo for a drop of more than 10 percent from its peak.

Legendary investor Warren Buffett, whose market moves are closely watched due to his decades-long record of outperforming the S&P 500, dumped at least $134bn in stocks in 2024 in a sell-off that was widely interpreted as a signal that the market was running too hot.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday will visit the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where he'll take a tour and attend a board meeting.

It will be his first time at the venerable institution since he began remaking it at the start of his second term in office. 

Trump fired the previous board of the Kennedy Center, writing on social media that they “do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.” He replaced them with loyalists and made himself chairman. 

The Republican president's allies have complained that the Kennedy Center, which is known for its annual celebration of notable American artists, had become too liberal and “woke” with its programming. 

“We have to straighten it out. It's not a good situation,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday evening. 

The Kennedy Center, which sits on the banks of the Potomac River, opened in 1971 and has enjoyed bipartisan support over the years. 

However, Trump has a fraught relationship with it, dating to his first term as president. He skipped the annual honors ceremony each year, breaking with tradition.

""Uncommon is Calling"" reveals meaningful opportunities for prospective Soldiers to serve their communities

WASHINGTON, March 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The U.S. Army announced a new marketing campaign exclusively focused on opportunities in the Army National Guard. ""Uncommon is Calling"" challenges young people to reimagine the potential of part-time service by comparing Soldiers' everyday lives to the uncommon experiences they gain as part of the Army National Guard. 

New U.S. Army National Guard campaign spotlights extraordinary impact of part-time service

With a presence in 54 states and territories, the Army National Guard is a unique component of the U.S. Army where Soldiers support communities in their home state by responding to domestic emergencies and at the federal level as standby support for Active Duty Soldiers. Army National Guard Soldiers have the flexibility to serve part-time across medical, aviation, law enforcement, transportation, and engineering fields and beyond, while also pursuing their personal and professional goals through a civilian career or higher education. 

""Many young people are unaware that they can serve in the Army part-time,"" says Brig. Gen. Antoinette Gant, Chief of Army Enterprise Marketing. ""To bridge this gap, 'Uncommon is Calling' offers youth a new perspective on Army service by presenting the experiences, flexibility, and local impact that can only be achieved as part of the Army National Guard.""

The campaign delivers five films featuring real Soldiers in emergency scenarios based on the missions that the Army National Guard completes every year. Each one provides an up-close and personal view of Soldiers as uncommon experiences unfold through their eyes:

Influenced by youth brands and street posters, the films' black-and-white visuals and distinct typography aim to appeal to this new generation of prospective Soldiers and showcase how the Army National Guard is distinct from other paths to military service. 

""The campaign represents just a few of the many ways Army National Guard Soldiers make an impact in their communities,"" says Gant. ""By showing the variety of capabilities and extraordinary blend of skills National Guard Soldiers can gain through service, we are inspiring the next generation of Soldiers who seek exciting challenges, opportunities for growth, and a deep sense of purpose.""

""Uncommon is Calling"" will reach audiences across a variety of channels and distribution methods, including streaming platforms like MAX, CBS, and ESPN, and digital platforms like YouTube, Meta, Reddit, LinkedIn, and NationalGuard.com, with an emphasis on local and state-specific extensions to meet prospective Soldiers where they are.   

For more information on ""Uncommon is Calling"" and the opportunities to serve in the Army National Guard visit NationalGuard.com.

Updated on:  March 17, 2025 / 10:22 AM EDT
          / CBS/AP
        

Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 40 people across six states. 

The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Forecasters assigned an unusual ""high risk"" designation to the system, which was also blamed for icy winter weather in northern parts of the country and severe thunderstorms, including on the West Coast, on Sunday.

In all, extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south.

Heavy thunderstorms in the forecast for Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, prompted schedule changes for the 2025 Players Championship, CBS Sports reported. The tournament moved up tee times Sunday and grouped golfers together to ensure the last 18 holes would be completed before the evening.

In Kansas, at least eight people died and numerous injuries were reported Friday after more than 55 vehicles were involved in a crash due to a dust storm.  

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves reported six deaths across three counties as multiple tornadoes swept through the state. At least three others had been missing, but were all found as of Sunday evening. Reeves said. At least 27 people were injured across the state and some 217 people were displaced by the storms. A peak of about 36,000 customers had lost power, but by Sunday evening that was down to a little under 8,000, Reeves said. 

Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12, authorities said. The deaths included a man whose home was ripped apart by a tornado.

""It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field,"" said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. ""The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.""

Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt's house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri.

""It was a very rough deal last night,"" Henderson said Saturday, not far from the splintered home from which he said they rescued his aunt through a window of the only room left standing. ""It's really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night.""

Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe said that first responders, volunteers and faith-based partners ""worked tirelessly"" through the night ""in response to a series of devastating tornadoes and severe storms, and before that, dangerous and damaging fires."" 

In Oklahoma, the governor said one person died on the road, presumably due to smoke. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner later confirmed at least four people had died in the state as a result of fires or high winds.

In Arkansas, officials reported three fatalities in Independence County, and 29 people were reported injured in eight counties in connection to a storm system that moved through the state overnight. Staff from the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) have been called to the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) due to extensive storm damage across the state. 

The National Weather Service on Sunday noted at least two areas in the state where ""damage consistent with EF-4 tornado damage"" was seen.

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Saturday that she spoke with President Trump after Friday night's tornados in the state. 

""[Trump] said to tell the people of Arkansas he loves them and he and his administration are here to help with whatever we need following last night's tornadoes,"" she said in a post on X.

Mr. Trump on Sunday announced on social media the National Guard had been deployed to Arkansas.

Further south in Texas, officials said four people died after weather-related fatalities, some during car crashes in the midst of a dust storm.

""It's the worst I've ever seen,"" said Sgt. Cindy Barkley of the state's department of public safety, calling the near-zero visibility a nightmare. ""We couldn't tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled.""

Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers.

""This is terrible out here,"" said Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48-foot trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. ""There's a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I'm not pushing it over 55 mph. I'm scared it will blow over if I do.""

The severe storm front sparked tornadoes in Alabama as it moved eastward, killing at least three people. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said Sunday that one of the deaths was confirmed in Plantersville and another in Winterboro, both in the state's central region. 

Earlier, the weather service issued multiple tornado warnings across Alabama, advising residents to seek shelter Saturday night. In the east Alabama community of Elrod, a CBS News spotter reported that a possible tornado had uprooted trees and damaged at least one home. 

And in Sipsey, Alabama, north of Birmingham, a 911 call center told CBS News that a suspected tornado had caused possible injuries and damaged several homes.

At one point, weather service employees at the agency's Birmingham office were forced to abandon operations and take shelter themselves. 

""We're back. Much thanks to @NWSAtlanta for the help!"" NWS Birmingham wrote on social media. 

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has declared an emergency in anticipation of the storm's continued shift eastward. Early Sunday morning, the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency used its social media accounts to repost a National Weather Service tornado watch for parts of southeast Georgia. The watch warned of isolated tornadoes, hail and wind gusts of 50 to 70 miles per hour.

On the East Coast, heavy rain could bring flash flooding to some areas on Sunday. 

Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.

""What's unique about this one is its large size and intensity,"" said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. ""And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area.""

The Storm Prediction Center uses five categories to warn of expected severe weather, ranging from marginal to high. Its forecast maps are color-coded, with the lowest risk areas in green and the highest shown in magenta.

On Saturday, the area of highest risk included parts of Mississippi and Alabama.

The ""high risk"" designation is used when severe weather is expected to include ""numerous intense and long-tracked tornadoes"" or thunderstorms producing hurricane-force wind gusts and inflicting widespread damage, according to the agency's product descriptions.

On many days when the ""high risk"" designation was used in recent years, the forecasts became reality.

The weather service said at least five tornadoes were reported in Missouri on Friday, including one in the St. Louis area. Several buildings were damaged in the storm, including a strip mall in Rolla, Missouri, where a tornado was reported Friday afternoon.

The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible.

""Potentially violent"" tornadoes were expected Saturday in parts of the central Gulf Coast and Deep South into the Tennessee Valley, according to the National Weather Service.

The Storm Prediction Center said parts of Mississippi, including Jackson and Hattiesburg, and areas of Alabama, including Birmingham and Tuscaloosa, were at a high risk. Severe storms and tornadoes were also possible across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle.

Wildfires in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds, and evacuations were ordered Friday for some communities in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico.

A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile to an estimated 32.8 square miles, the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles before its advance was halted in the afternoon. 

In Oklahoma, the National Weather Service said a ""complex of extremely dangerous fires"" was located northeast of Oklahoma City, near Stillwater, and urged some people in the city of about 50,000 to evacuate on Friday evening. Officials issued mandatory evacuation orders via social media that included homes, hotels and a Walmart.

Overall, nearly 150 fires were reported in Oklahoma, Andy James, the state's Forestry Services fire management chief, told local media. The State Patrol said on social media that winds toppled several tractor-trailers. 

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said that 70,000 acres had burned in the state. About 293 homes and structures had been destroyed as of Saturday afternoon — including Stitt's own farmhouse, he said. 

Firefighters had been prepositioned in certain areas, which helps authorities jump on blazes early, James said. Firefighting aircraft were also deployed in some parts of Oklahoma and Texas but were generally unable to fly due to low visibility from smoke and dust, he added.

Officials urged people in some areas of central Missouri's Camden County to evacuate due to wildfires, and the State Highway Patrol warned via social media that they were nearing homes and businesses.

Roughly 120 miles of Interstate 70 in western Kansas were temporarily shut down due to blowing dust and limited visibility.

High winds also knocked out power to more than 250,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Mississippi, according to the website poweroutage.us.

The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches were expected, with up to a foot possible.

Winds gusting to 60 mph were expected to cause whiteout conditions.

A French politician says the United States should return New York City's iconic Statue of Liberty, which was gifted by France 138 years ago.

The statue, which was given to the U.S. on the 100th anniversary of its independence, has long been a defining feature of the New York City skyline and an emblem of the free world.

At a party convention for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, Raphael Glucksmann, a member of European Parliament, told his colleagues that America should return the gift as the country no longer embodies or protects the values of democracy and freedom.

“We're going to say to the Americans who have chosen to side with the tyrants, to the Americans who fired researchers for demanding scientific freedom, give us back the Statue of Liberty,” he said, according to media reports.

“We gave it to you as a gift, but apparently you despise it. So it will be just fine here at home.”

At a White House press briefing on Monday, when asked if the U.S. government would return the statue, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed the French politician's comments off, saying that the U.S. will “absolutely not” be returning it.

“My advice to that unnamed low-level French politician would be to remind them that it's only because of the United States of America that the French are not speaking German right now. So they should be very grateful to our great country,” she told reporters.

Glucksmann's comments come amid a flurry of protests against the Trump administration both domestically and from the international community.

In Canada, American flags flown outside government buildings, schools and sports arenas are being taken down.

Over the weekend, flags flying in Mississauga, Ont., were removed following Mayor Carolyn Parrish's approval.

“At the request of many, the City has begun to remove all American flags from sports arenas and locations along Lake Ontario, including the pier at Snug Harbour in Port Credit. Oversized Canadian flags (15'x30') are ordered and will be installed on all the poles at City Hall,” she wrote on X.

The City of Barrie, Ont., has also taken down American flags.

Meanwhile, Canadians are reducing travel south of the border and are opting to buy domestically produced products.

According to a recent survey by Canadian market researcher Leger, 59 per cent said they are less likely to visit the U.S. in 2025 than in 2024, and two-thirds of Canadians have minimized their purchasing of American goods both in-store and online.

Canadian sports fans have been drowning out The Star-Spangled Banner at professional events between American and Canadian teams, a phenomenon that former prime minister Justin Trudeau said would likely continue during an address to the nation and Trump in February.

In the U.S. an audience at the Kennedy Center booed vice-president JD Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, as they took their seats ahead of a classical concert last weekend.

The vice-president was also met by demonstrators during a ski trip to Vermont last month, following his and Trump's dressing down of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office.

Canada wants to “maintain the most positive possible” relationship with the United States, Prime Minister Mark Carney said as he kicked off his first international trip since taking office.

Carney was in France, where he meet with French President Emmanuel Macron before leaving for the United Kingdom later on Monday.

In joint opening remarks before their meeting in Paris, Carney stressed that Canada and France shared values of sovereignty, solidarity and sustainability and must strengthen their ties.

“With you Mr. President, I want to ensure that France and the whole of Europe works enthusiastically with Canada, the most European of non-European countries, determined, like you, to maintain the most positive possible relations with the United States,” Carney said in English.

“Canada is a reliable, trustworthy, and strong partner of France, which shares our values and lives them through action during this age of economic and geopolitical crises.”

Carney also said Canada and France know that economic co-operation, not confrontation, will help build strong economies.

This was Carney's first in-person meeting with an international leader as prime minister.

Macron called Canada a “unique friend” with a shared vision of freedom. He also underscored a deep strategic partnership for trade, defence, protecting the environment and creating new technologies.

“We believe that fair trade that respects international rules is a good thing for everyone's prosperity and it is far more effective than tariffs that simply create inflation and destroy the integration of our economies and our supply chain,” he said.

Carney's Europe trip comes just days after he was sworn in as Canada's prime minister Friday.

Later on Monday, Carney arrived in London, where he had a private audience with King Charles III at Buckingham Palace.

The Royal Family's X account shared a photo of the King with Carney, but did not mention what was discussed at the audience.

Carney will also meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer before travelling to Canada's north on Tuesday.

The meetings are taking place amid global trade uncertainty as U.S. President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs on America's allies, including Canada and European nations, with more threatened to come.

Carney said on Friday that he currently has no plans to go to the U.S., but he looks forward to speaking to Trump at the “appropriate moment.”

On Sunday, Carney spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during which he “reaffirmed Canada's steadfast support for Ukraine” in its fight against Russia's invasion, according to a statement from the Prime Minister's Office.

Carney also formally invited Zelenskyy to the G7 Summit that will take place in Alberta in June.

US Stocks:

The sale would add a lever for the company as it seeks to secure $42 billion over the next few years by selling securities to buy Bitcoin.

Michael Saylor's Strategy said it bought $10.7 million of Bitcoin, a week after unveiling plans to issue up to $21 billion of preferred stock to acquire more of the cryptocurrency. 

The enterprise software company turned leveraged Bitcoin proxy controlled by co-founder and chairman Saylor has been buying Bitcoin on a frequent basis since late October. The former MicroStrategy purchased 130 Bitcoin at an average price of approximately $82,981 from March 10 through March 16, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. It now holds about $41.6 billion of Bitcoin. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}"

Bitcoin (BTC) started Monday in the red with a 2% drop over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Indices data, leading to heaviness in the broader market as major tokens fell as much as 5%.

BTC touched resistance at $84,000 on Sunday, making it a key level to cross for chances of a run to the upside and trading at just over $83,300 in Asian afternoon hours Monday. 

Majors such as XRP, Solana's (SOL), Cardano's (ADA) and dogecoin (DOGE) tanked as much as 5%, while BNB Chain's (BNB) stood out as the only major in green with a 3% rise.

The crypto market has plateaued since last week's sell-off due to the U.S. tariffs and deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. Concerns over a U.S. recession is growing due to Trump's tariffs, traders say, with the likelihood of choppiness ahead as a correlation with U.S. equities staying intact.

Still, some see oncoming volatility in altcoins and memecoins amid a flat market regime.

“Trading volume has increased for altcoins after Trump's World Liberty Financial bought MNT and AVAX, the latter of which was also part of an ETF application by VanEck,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, said in a Telegram message. “This may be a sign that traders and investors will focus on altcoins in the short term for better gains compared to large-cap coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum.”

Traders say the current sell-off could have been caused by an unwinding of ETF and spot-linked traders. 

“The current belief is that the current sell-off is entirely driven by the massive 'multi-strat' hedge fund strategies that have dominated the macro space,” Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

Multi-strategy (multi-strat) trades involve hedge funds using diverse tactics — like arbitrage, long-short positions, and leverage — to maximize returns across asset classes. 

In bitcoin's case, a popular multi-strat approach is the basis trade where funds buy spot BTC(often via ETFs) and short BTC futures to profit from price differences. This locks in low-risk gains when the spread is favorable.

When profits from basis trades shrink, due to tighter spreads or market shifts , funds exit positions, selling bitcoin and ETF shares en masse. This liquidation pressure likely amplified the sell-off, especially amid tariff-related volatility in the past week.

However, the “buy-the-dip” mentality persists among bulls.

“Equity valuations outside of the major large caps are relatively contained vs historical averages, and economic hard data is likely to outperform the rapid deterioration in soft data, so market consensus is that this remains a 'buy the dip' market while we work through the tariff volatility,” Fan added.

Bitcoin (BTC) daily price chart shows signs of recovery in the largest cryptocurrency. Strategy, one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, acquired another 130 BTC last week, according to an announcement on Monday. 

Ethereum (ETH) gained 1.54%, and XRP added 2.40% to its value today. 

Bitcoin trades at $83,000 at the time of writing. Technical indicators on the BTC/USDT daily price chart support a thesis of gains in the largest cryptocurrency. 

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 42 and is sloping upward. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line. The Bitcoin price trend has an underlying positive momentum on the daily timeframe. 

The two key momentum indicators support Bitcoin's gains, and a return to resistance at the $90,000 level is likely. 

BTC price is currently 8.35% away from the $90,000 resistance. The $90,000 level is key to Bitcoin price since the token has been hovering under this level since March 7, as observed in the BTC/USDT chart below:





BTC/USDT daily price chart 

Ethereum trades at $1,902 at the time of writing. The largest altcoin in the crypto market looks prepared to test the psychologically important $2,000 level and attempt to close above the resistance. 

The $2,000 level holds significance as it remained as key support for Ethereum for over a year, as observed on the ETH/USDT daily price chart. 

A 5% rally from the current price could push Ether to $2,000. A successful daily candlestick close above the $2,000 mark could push the altcoin toward resistance at the lower boundary of the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at $2,533. 

The rally to $2,533 would mark an over 30% gain from the current ETH price. 

Two key momentum indicators, the RSI and MACD, support Ether's recent gains. The RSI is sloping upward and reads 34, while the MACD shows an underlying positive momentum in Ethereum price trend.

A failure to test the $2,000 level could imply weakness in Ether's price trend and the nearly 16-month low at $1,754 could come into play as support. 

XRP trades at $2.3386 at the time of writing on Monday. The altcoin gained nearly 2% on the day, and the momentum indicators on the daily price chart support gains in XRP. 

The 50% Fibonacci retracement of XRP's decline from the peak of $3.40 to the February low of $1.7711 — at $2.5856 — is a key resistance for the altcoin. A rally to this level could mark 10% gains in XRP. 

The RSI reads 48 and is sloping upward, while the MACD flashes green histogram bars above the neutral line.



XRP/USDT daily price chart

In the event of a flash crash in Bitcoin, altcoins like XRP and Ether could face a correction. XRP could find support at the multi-month low of $1.7711 if there is a serious decline in the altcoin's price. 

Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, told FXStreet that the recent Bitcoin pullback put the spotlight on the $82,000 and $85,000 support levels. 

Lee said, “It's a classic post-rally consolidation phase that is healthy but also a test of whether Bitcoin's recent momentum has real staying power. Institutional buying and the buzz around a potential US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve continue to prop up sentiment, but with resistance looming near $85,000–$90,000, a breakout won't come easy. 

Let's not forget the macro wildcard: any unexpected FOMC moves could throw a wrench into the market. If sentiment turns bearish, we could see Bitcoin dip toward $75,000–$80,000, though a bullish macro backdrop could send it climbing back to $90,000.”

Observing that Ethereum and Bitcoin are tightly correlated and the altcoin tends to respond to shifts in the BTC price trend, Lee told FXStreet:

“The ETH/BTC ratio's weakness suggests Ethereum is struggling to find independent strength, even with promising developments on the horizon. The Pectra upgrade and ongoing Layer 2 expansion give it a bullish long-term case, but in the short term, those fundamentals might not be enough to break resistance at $2,300–$2,500 without Bitcoin leading the charge. If market sentiment sours, ETH could slip to $1,800, but Ethereum could push toward the top of its range if BTC stages a recovery. Right now, it's a waiting game—does Bitcoin hold the line, or does the market need a deeper reset before the next leg up?”

South Korea dismisses adding bitcoin to its foreign exchange reserves, citing extreme volatility and failure to meet IMF standards for reserves. 

The Bank of Korea (BOK) has dismissed the possibility of establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve, citing concerns over price volatility and risks. This comes despite ongoing global discussions about using bitcoin as part of foreign exchange reserves following the United States plans to create a reserve.

JUST IN: 🇰🇷 South Korea's central bank dismisses establishing a Strategic #Bitcoin Reserve Says its “price volatility is very high” 👀 pic.twitter.com/CppD3nvC52

In response to an inquiry from a member of the National Assembly's Strategy and Finance Committee, the central bank rejected adding bitcoin to its reserves. BOK officials emphasized bitcoin's wild price swings as a key deterrent, stating that transaction costs to convert bitcoin to cash “could rise drastically” if the market experiences instability.

As of March 17th, bitcoin trades around $83,500, having fallen 23% from its peak of $108,000 in January. The BOK warned that this extreme volatility poses significant risks to its reserves.

The bank also indicated that bitcoin fails to meet the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) criteria for reserve assets. The IMF calls for prudent management of liquidity, market, and credit risks for reserves – standards bitcoin does not currently satisfy in the eyes of the BOK.

This latest stance marks the first time the South Korean central bank has directly addressed the possibility of using bitcoin as a reserve asset. It emphasized a “cautious approach” regarding bitcoin.

The dismissal of a strategic bitcoin reserve comes despite growing attention on crypto's potential role in reserves globally. Earlier in March, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve. This fueled discussions in South Korea and other Asian nations about following suit.

On March 6th, the Trump administration announced the establishment of a cryptocurrency reserve. This reserve is purported to modernize the nation's financial strategy by holding digital assets—such as Bitcoin—as part of its national reserves. Since the reserve's establishment, the price of Bitcoin has experienced a sharp sell-off as investors reacted to the order's potential regulatory and market implications....

By Dallas Morning News Editorial



Texas doesn't need a bitcoin reserve any more than it needs a Beanie Baby reserve or a tulip bulb fund. Nevertheless, state leaders are determined to create one.

The Senate passed SB 21 on March 6, which authorizes the state to establish the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve “for the purpose of investing in cryptocurrency.” The bill, which had strong bipartisan support, assigns oversight of the fund to the comptroller of public accounts. The legislation also allows, but does not require, the state to make appropriations into the fund.

Call us old-fashioned, dismiss us as Luddites, but we cannot endorse financial speculation with public dollars. Cryptocurrency is far too volatile an asset to belong in a public reserve fund. It is too frequently associated with fraud, theft and other illegal activity, even though it is theoretically extremely secure. Private investors can do what they want with their money, but public agencies should avoid this market for now.

In their most general sense, reserve funds help households, nonprofit organizations and businesses cover both expected and unexpected expenses. Local governments often hold reserves to pay off debt or in case revenue falls short of projections. No matter the reserve fund's ultimate purpose, governments must be conservative — in the financial sense — investors. Not losing public money is more important than trying to make a lot of money.

That's why public funds shouldn't be invested in cryptocurrency. It offers overly abundant opportunities to lose principal. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, and even the best-known are volatile. The price of bitcoin rose above $109,000 on Jan. 20 but fell below $77,000 on March 11 – a loss of about 30%.

Another source of risk is theft. Hackers have proved remarkably astute in finding flaws that allow them to abscond with large amounts of cryptocurrency. In February, for example, the FBI accused North Korea-affiliated criminals of stealing $1.5 billion of ethereum from the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange.

There are other concerns. Mining cryptocurrency demands enormous amounts of electricity. Maybe a growing state with increasingly warm weather shouldn't be investing in a business that will further strain the electrical grid.

Last, the majority of Americans don't trust cryptocurrencies. The Pew Research Center surveys Americans annually about their attitudes on the issue. Last year's survey found that only 17% of Americans had ever used these currencies — a share that hasn't changed since 2021. Sixty-three percent of respondents said they had little to no confidence that existing ways to invest in, trade or use cryptocurrencies are safe or reliable.

A government-sponsored Bitcoin reserve is questionable at best, and adding “strategic” to the fund's name doesn't make it any safer or smarter. Texas doesn't need to fall for this fad.

The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has proposed restricting cryptocurrency transactions to the wealthiest individuals, preventing most citizens from trading digital assets unless they meet stringent financial criteria.

Under the proposed framework, only individuals classified as ""especially qualified investors"" would be permitted to buy and sell cryptocurrency. This status would be granted to those with financial assets exceeding RUB100mn ($1.2mn) or an annual income above RUB50mn ($580,000). The proposal also suggests allowing companies already classified as qualified investors under current legislation to participate in the experiment. These include professional financial market participants such as banks, insurance companies, brokers, trust managers, non-state pension funds and asset management companies for mutual investment funds.

The CBR argues that cryptocurrencies pose significant risks due to their volatility and lack of state backing. Beyond these wealthy investors, the regulator has proposed a ""ban on transactions between residents using cryptocurrency.""

""The Bank of Russia still does not recognise cryptocurrency as a means of payment,"" the CBR stated, adding that digital assets ""are not issued or guaranteed by any jurisdiction, are based on mathematical algorithms, and are highly volatile.""

The proposal is part of ongoing efforts to regulate digital assets in Russia, where authorities have long maintained a sceptical stance on cryptocurrency. While private individuals are already prohibited from using crypto for payments, ownership is not banned, and the government has permitted limited use in international transactions under an experimental legal framework. This has gained importance following the imposition of Western sanctions after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Moscow Exchange has indicated its readiness to launch crypto-related trading instruments once a regulatory structure is in place.

Despite government resistance to widespread cryptocurrency adoption, Russia has gradually introduced measures to regulate digital assets. In 2024, the country legalised cryptocurrency mining under specific conditions, while a new tax regime for digital assets took effect in 2025.

The global altcoin market is agog with activity as investors rotate assets across the markets to navigate the market lull.

Among mega-cap altcoins, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have taken center stage, driven by significant ecosystem developments. 

For Solana, the CME Group, one of the world's largest institutional trading platforms, has confirmed the launch of Solana ETF futures on Monday.

This news aligns with the blockchain marking its fifth anniversary — forming a dual bullish catalyst.

Ethereum's ""Hoodi"" testnet goes live on Monday, marking a key step toward boosting DeFi capabilities and scalability.

ETH price has increased by 1.7% to reclaim the $1,900 level at press time, signalling widespread optimism around the network update.

Taking a broader look at the market, here's a breakdown of the day's standout performers and laggards:

BNB Price Action, March 17 | CoinMarketCap

 The price action among major altcoins reflects a mixed market sentiment :

The current market dynamic signals that despite positive catalysts from Solana fifth birthday and SOL futures ETF launch on CME Group, fears surrounding the FXT estate's recent token unlocks continue to weigh heavily on SOL's short-term price momentum. 

In response, investors are strategically channeling funds toward Solana's layer-1 rivals, XRP and LTC, with ETF filings in progress. 

Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of Telegram linked to the development of blockchain network Toncoin, has announced his return to Dubai after spending several months in France due to an ongoing investigation into criminal activities on the messaging platform.
 
Durov expressed gratitude to the investigative judges for permitting his return and thanked his legal team and the Telegram community for their support. 

He emphasized that Telegram has consistently exceeded legal obligations concerning moderation and cooperation with law enforcement.

The investigation, which began with Durov's arrest in August near Paris, centers on allegations that Telegram facilitated illegal activities such as the distribution of child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking.

VanEck has submitted a filing to the US Securities & Exchange Commission for an Avalanche (AVAX) ETF, aiming to provide investors with direct exposure to the smart contract platform.

The proposed fund will track AVAX's price performance while deducting operating expenses.

According to the filing, the ETF will value its shares based on the MarketVector Avalanche Benchmark Rate.

If approved, this would mark one of the first AVAX-focused ETFs in the US, expanding institutional access to the Avalanche ecosystem.

OKX has temporarily halted its decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator after identifying misuse linked to the North Korean hacking group Lazarus.

The exchange announced the suspension as a precautionary measure while conducting an internal review and implementing additional security upgrades.

Despite the suspension, OKX will continue to offer wallet services but will restrict new wallet creation in certain markets.

The platform's security enhancements aim to strengthen defenses against hacker activity and prevent further exploitation of its DeFi services.

Amid a 2% decrease in market capitalization, crypto trading volume surges 42% to $87.2 billion in the last 24 hours, signalling active capital rotation. Bitcoin price stagnates below $85,000 as Gold enters a record rally to $3,000 ahead of the US Fed rate decision.

Bitcoin (BTC) daily price chart shows signs of recovery in the largest cryptocurrency. Strategy, one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, acquired another 130 BTC last week, according to an announcement on Monday. 

The 2025 Formula 1 season kicked off in Australia last week with a lineup of crypto sponsors for half of the teams. Racing giants are powered by sponsors like crypto exchanges Binance, OKX, ApeCoin, and Crypto.com, among other NFT and trading platforms.  

The US SEC postponed its decisions on several spot altcoin ETF applications this week, including those for Litecoin, XRP and Solana. A K33 Research report shows there is consensus but the agency is waiting the confirmation of Trump's nominee for SEC Chair. 

Bitcoin price remained constrained within a tight 8% channel between $76,000 and $84,472 this week. With conflicting market catalysts preventing prolonged directional swings, here are key factors that moved BTC prices this week, as well as key indicators to watch in the weeks ahead.

The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has nixed Zeux Limited's attempt to secure registration as a cryptoasset exchange provider.

The application, submitted in June 2022, showed that the firm had failed to implement anti-money laundering controls and carry out effective risk management.

The anti-money laundering controls put forward by Zeux Limited fell well short of legislative requirements. Registration of the firm would have posed a significant risk of harm to the public.

The application showed:

These points are critical for mitigating the risks of money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions evasion that a customer may pose.

Cryptoasset exchange providers must be registered with the FCA and comply with the UK money laundering regulations to operate legally in the UK.

US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded their longest run of weekly net outflows since listing in January last year as US President Donald Trump's tariffs drove a wider retreat from riskier assets. 

Investors pulled over $5.5 billion in total from the group of 12 ETFs over the past five weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The record outflows started shortly after Trump returned to the White House, underscoring how even crypto investors have focused more on the trade war he ignited than on his crypto-friendly policies like creating a digital-asset stockpile.

Amid revolutionary announcements, technological developments, and regulatory turbulence, the crypto ecosystem continues to prove that it is both a realm of limitless innovations and a battlefield for regulatory and economic struggles. Here is a summary of the most notable news from the past week regarding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, Solana, and Ripple.

Despite a 25% drop in the price of Bitcoin and a decrease in inflows, Bitcoin ETFs maintain 95% of their assets under management, which amounts to approximately $115 billion. This behavior, similar to that of traditional ETFs, indicates a shift in investor perception towards a more long-term approach. However, warning signs are emerging with capital outflows reaching $1.6 billion over the last month and a decline in BTC demand, which could signal potential turbulence in the market. 🔗 Read the full article

The case between the SEC and Ripple could finally be coming to an end after four years of legal battle. The commission is considering ending the proceedings following a judgment that fined Ripple $125 million. If appeals are abandoned by both sides, the decision will remain in place, but in case of disagreement, a new negotiation will be necessary. This potential conclusion coincides with a shift in direction from the SEC, which is dropping other lawsuits against crypto companies. 🔗 Read the full article

Bitcoin reinforces its grip on the crypto market with a dominance of 61.2%, confirming the slowdown of the altcoins rally. After a brief spike linked to Donald Trump's election, investors are retreating to BTC, seen as a safe-haven asset in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. If this trend continues, Bitcoin's supremacy may further increase, especially as institutions continue to adopt it on a wide scale. 🔗 Read the full article

The crypto platform Binance has received a $2 billion investment from MGX, a fund based in Abu Dhabi. This fundraising, conducted in stablecoins, is the largest ever in the crypto sector. CZ took advantage of the announcement to discuss a possible “altcoin season,” fueling speculation about a new bullish cycle for alternative cryptos. This investment could also help Binance solidify its dominant position and navigate an increasingly strict regulatory environment. 🔗 Read the full article

Marine Le Pen proposes to exploit surplus nuclear electricity to power Bitcoin mining. During a visit to the EPR in Flamanville, she criticized the underutilization of the French nuclear fleet, which operates at 70% capacity compared to 90% in the United States. Instead of reducing production during low-demand periods, she wants to channel excess energy into crypto mining to generate income for EDF. While this initiative appeals to some industry players, it also raises questions about its environmental impact and economic viability. 🔗 Read the full article

The speculative frenzy surrounding memecoins ended abruptly, leading to a 93% drop in Solana's revenue, which fell from $55.3 million to $4 million per week. The Pump.fun site, which accounted for 80% of the network's revenue, saw its activity collapse after the fall of the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens. Solana's TVL has lost nearly 50%, and the price of SOL has dropped by 58% in just a few weeks. This crisis highlights the network's dependence on speculative cycles and raises doubts about its ability to build a more stable and diversified ecosystem. 🔗 Read the full article

As Bitcoin nears $100,000, market watchers anticipate short-term consolidation, though the asset's uptrend is likely to continue.

Bitcoin (BTC) price returning to $100,000 could prompt “short-term consolidation,” analysts warn, though the long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency remains positive. While key psychological levels often lead to profit-taking, analysts point to gold's rise to new all-time highs as a sign of growing momentum for alternative assets.

Analysts at Matrixport noted that the shift in sentiment that began in the summer of 2023, when gold broke above $2,000, has boosted the outlook for Bitcoin since it has increasingly been seen as a form of “digital gold,” a narrative popularized by investment giant firm BlackRock.

“Regardless of the prevailing narrative, both gold and Bitcoin are poised to grow in importance as alternative assets gain momentum. While key psychological levels-such as gold at $3,000 or Bitcoin at $100,000-could trigger short-term consolidation, the broader uptrend likely remains intact.”

Markus Thielen, independent analyst

As crypto.news explained earlier, Bitcoin now faces two potential risks and two opportunities. First, there are signs that investor sentiment remains fearful.

While the fear and greed index has moved out of the extreme fear zone (18), it still sits in the fear zone at 22. Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies perform better when the index is in the greedy zone. This continued fear is reflected in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which saw $143 million in assets leave, bringing total weekly outflows to $870 million. These funds have experienced outflows for five consecutive weeks.

Second, Bitcoin has formed a death cross as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages crossed, signaling potential downside.

The cryptocurrency market is teetering as the stablecoin supply surges past $219 billion, a sign that the bullish momentum may still have some way to run. This trend, detailed by Yahoo Finance, typically heralds investor interest, with stablecoins acting as a bridge from fiat to crypto markets. According to insights from the IndexBox platform, the last comparable surge in stablecoin supply, which hit $187 billion in April 2022, preceded a bearish market turn.

However, the broader crypto market is experiencing a correction. Ethereum value has plummeted more than 50% from its December 2024 highs, raising concerns among traders. A dip below the $1,900 mark, a crucial demand zone, is predicted by some analysts and could trigger further buy-in. The market's eyes are on the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 19, which could provide direction based on recent economic data. With the U.S. economy showing signs of slowing, suggested by declining jobless claims and the Producer Price Index (PPI), many predict the Federal Reserve will maintain current interest rates, thus providing much-needed market clarity.

Despite the short-term market jitters, some experts hold a bullish long-term view. Investment firm VanEck posits that Ether could reach $6,000, and Bitcoin might soar to $180,000 by the end of 2025, reflecting the potential enduring upward trend in the market. Investors remain hopeful that the current correction, coupled with the increased stablecoin supply, signals that the bull market is still well in play, with critical guidance anticipated from the FOMC's proceedings as they unfold.

Ethereum's price remains in a deep bear market after plunging more than 53% from its November high.

Ethereum (ETH) has crashed below the crucial support at $2,000, and is hovering near its lowest point since November 6.

The ongoing crash happened as demand for the coin waned in Wall Street. All spot Ethereum ETFs have had outflows in the last three consecutive weeks, bringing the cumulative net inflow to $2.52 billion. Total assets have dropped to about $6.72 billion. 

Ethereum's decline has also been fueled by growing fear in the crypto market. The closely watched crypto fear and greed index has dropped to the fear zone of 21. Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins tend to underperform when investor sentiment is weak.

The recent ETH token sales by Ethereum Foundation have not helped. Just last week, Harikrishnan Mulackal, an ex-engineer at the foundation, warned that Ethereum's future was at risk without clear leadership. 

Ethereum network has continued to face substantial competition from other layer-1 chains like Solana (SOL) and BSC Chain. According to DeFi Llama, DEX protocols on Ethereum handled $1.012 billion in token volume on Monday, lower than BSC's $1.63 billion and Solana's $1.077 billion.

The ongoing ETH price crash happened after it formed a triple-top pattern on the weekly chart. This pattern has three peaks and a neckline, which in this case, was at $2,126. 

Ethereum also formed a death cross on the daily chart when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages crossed on February 13. A death cross is considered one of the riskiest patterns in technical analysis.

Now, ETH is slowly forming another bearish pattern — a pennant. This formation consists of a long vertical line followed by a symmetrical triangle. The triangle is nearing its confluence point, suggesting that a bearish breakdown could happen soon.

Therefore, a drop below the year-to-date low of $1,757 could signal further declines to the psychological level of $1,500.

A potential catalyst that may boost Ethereum's price this week is the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday. A dovish tone from the Fed could lift ETH and other cryptocurrencies.

        Share    

Bitcoin's market has seen a major reset, with over $10 billion in open interest wiped out in just two months, leading analysts to believe that a Bitcoin price recovery is imminent.

According CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost's latest market analysis post on X, on Jan. 17, Bitcoin's (BTC) open interest hit a record $33 billion, signaling extreme leverage in the market. However, political uncertainty tied to former U.S. President Donald Trump's recent actions led to a wave of liquidations.

Subsequently, nearly $10 billion in open interest vanished between Feb. 20 and Mar. 4. This sharp decline pushed Bitcoin's 90-day futures open interest change down to -14%, often signaling market resets before price recoveries. Analysts believe that eliminating excessive speculation, these stages provide a more stable basis for future growth. 

Bitcoin's long-term outlook is still optimistic despite the decline. According to economist Timothy Peterson, April and October are usually when Bitcoin experiences the biggest seasonal gains. Peterson's most recent analysis reveals that Bitcoin might hit new all-time highs before June, with a median target of $126,000.

In addition, his “Lowest Price Forward” model, which estimates a price level that Bitcoin is unlikely to drop below in future trading, indicates that Bitcoin's price floor has now risen to $69,000, with a 95% chance of holding. Past bull markets have shown that corrections like Bitcoin's recent 30% pullback often precede strong rebounds.

However, not all analysts are fully bullish. Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse, warned on a Mar. 15 YouTube stream that Bitcoin's bull cycle could be in jeopardy if it drops below the 2024 highs, which is in the lower $70,000s. Cowen compares the current cycle to 2017 when Bitcoin retested the prior year's high. 

He suggests the bull market might be over if Bitcoin closes in the low $60,000s. Additionally, according to Cowen, holding above $70,000–$73,000 would maintain the market's structure. Bitcoin may signal a macro lower high later in the year if it drops below this level, which could result in a more bearish outlook by Q3.

Bitcoin is still in a crucial consolidation phase, with its current price at $82,900 at the time of press. If past trends hold, this reset could pave the way for another strong rally in the coming months.

March 17, 2025 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Investorideas.com, rated as a top 100 investment website for investing ideas, issues market commentary from Rania Gule, Senior Market Analyst at XS.com - MENA

Bitcoin has recently experienced significant volatility, starting at $83,000 and recording an 8% gain from its weekly low of $76,000. Despite these gains, Bitcoin remains trapped in a zone between risks and opportunities, with tight price movements and a lack of clear direction in the market. While there have been some indicators supporting short-term gains for Bitcoin, economic and geopolitical pressures could lead to further declines.

Last week, financial markets closely monitored developments in the trade war between the U.S. and Canada, which overshadowed investor reactions to economic data showing declining inflation. Under these circumstances, Bitcoin trading volumes fell for the third consecutive week, reflecting, in my opinion, a decrease in public interest in the cryptocurrency. The trade war, exacerbated by harsh statements from President Donald Trump, has been a factor that overshadowed any optimism from better-than-expected economic data. This trade war poses a threat to the future of financial markets in general, including cryptocurrency markets, where investors remain cautious about potential economic fluctuations.

On the other hand, Bitcoin started the week within a narrow range between $76,000 and $84,000, a range it struggled to break out of for several days, reflecting market uncertainty. From my perspective, this relative stability indicates that the catalysts for significant price movements are currently absent, with decreased activity in the cryptocurrency market. In recent days, Bitcoin prices briefly fell below the $80,000 support level, reflecting the market's fragility in the face of global political and economic volatility.

Therefore, I expect Bitcoin to face weaker support if prices continue to decline in the coming week. If prices fall below $80,000 again, it could lead to a retest of the key support level, prompting traders to adjust their strategies more cautiously. This shift in market direction could increase the likelihood of new sell-offs, further pressuring the price and raising the chances of it dropping to lower levels.

Another factor that had a significant impact this week was the decisions made by Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Despite the ETFs seeing positive inflows of $13 million on Wednesday, the outflows from the market were larger, with investors pulling out an additional $830 million during the week, bringing the total outflows to $1.7 billion in March. This indicates that the market is still suffering from uncertainty, and the economic and geopolitical landscape could affect investor confidence in cryptocurrencies.

Regarding future expectations, some indicators may support Bitcoin in the coming weeks, despite the significant risks. Forecasts suggest that the Federal Reserve is highly likely to halt rate hikes in March, which could improve risk appetite among investors. If this happens, it could lead to more funds flowing into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, supporting a potential price rebound. Additionally, the chances of a resolution between Russia and Ukraine are approaching 75%, which could ease the geopolitical pressures that have been a negative factor in the markets.

Looking at geopolitical incentives, the potential decisions regarding Bitcoin from the U.S. government cannot be overlooked. Florida gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds is preparing to introduce a bill to protect Trump's policy on Bitcoin reserves, reflecting a political trend aimed at supporting Bitcoin's stability as an investment asset. This development could have a positive impact on the market if approved, as it would enhance confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term investment asset.

However, risks remain, in my opinion. Especially if the U.S.-Canada trade war escalates further, and if stock markets decline as a result of global monetary policy fluctuations, Bitcoin may face additional downward pressure. Therefore, investors must monitor developments related to Federal Reserve monetary policies and any political actions that could affect global financial stability.

In the end, the future of Bitcoin remains surrounded by significant geopolitical and financial risks, but some opportunities could arise from a halt in rate hikes and easing geopolitical tensions. As the situation in the trade war and monetary policy trends evolve, the coming week could be crucial for Bitcoin, as market directions become clearer. Although Bitcoin may face the risk of dropping to $75,000, the chances of a rebound to $90,000 may remain if economic and geopolitical conditions improve.

Some celebrity couples are more prominent than others.

Pairs like Leslie Bibb and Sam Rockwell are a bit more low-key and private.

Here are 16 celebrity couples you probably didn't realize are together.

Many celebrity couples are high-profile and open about their relationship, but others prefer to remain somewhat under the radar.

Among them are ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Taran Killam and ""How I Met Your Mother"" star Cobie Smulders, who said ""I do"" in 2012, and Leslie Bibb and Sam Rockwell, who have been together for over a decade and recently appeared on season three of ""The White Lotus.""

Keep reading for more celebrity pairs you likely weren't aware of.

Amy Daire contributed to a previous version of this article.

Sam Rockwell and Leslie Bibb

The two actors have been together for almost 18 years. They met at Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood in 2007 and went on their first date shortly after.

In 2010, Rockwell and Bibb both starred in ""Iron Man 2."" Rockwell played Justin Hammer, one of the film's antagonists, and Bibb portrayed Christine Everhart, a journalist.

Most recently, Rockwell guest-starred on season three of HBO's ""The White Lotus,"" which stars Bibb as Kate, one of this installment's privileged guests.

Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally

""Parks and Recreation"" star Nick Offerman and ""Will & Grace"" favorite Megan Mullally are a match made in comedy heaven and have been since 2003. They often appear in each other's projects, sometimes playing characters in a romantic relationship.

""We like each other,"" Mullally said in a NY Daily News interview. ""We also have a two-week rule, where we don't go more than two weeks without seeing each other. We've only broken it by a couple of days twice in 16 years.""

Amber Tamblyn and David Cross

""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" star Amber Tamblyn and ""Arrested Development"" actor David Cross took their relationship to the altar in 2012.

They welcomed their first child together, Marlow, in February 2017. The following month, Tamblyn and Cross shared a photo of the newborn on Instagram.

""Somehow my wife gave birth to a 55 year old furrier from Crown Heights,"" Cross joked. ""I'm investigating.""

Cobie Smulders and Taran Killam

""How I Met Your Mother"" star Cobie Smulders and ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Taran Killam got married in 2012 and have two children.

In 2012, the ""SNL"" star sat down for an interview with Vulture just days after the couple's wedding. When the interviewer asked Killam why they weren't on their honeymoon, he replied, ""Every day with Cobie is a honeymoon!""

In an interview with Parents, Smulders revealed that she always wanted to be a parent.

""I come from a big family,"" she said. ""I have two sisters and a brother and then my father remarried and I have four siblings from that marriage, which happened when I was quite young. So I always wanted kids but I also always wanted a career. I've always wanted both. It's a balancing system.""

Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz

James Bond actor Daniel Craig put a ring on it back in 2011 when he married actor Rachel Weisz in a private ceremony involving just her son and his daughter.

In a 2015 interview with MORE magazine, Weisz explained why they keep things private.

""He's just too famous,"" she said. ""It would be a betrayal. You have to protect your marriage. When you're young, you tell your girlfriends everything. One of the great pleasures of not being an adolescent is that you don't have to share everything. When you're married, that door closes. The audience goes, and you're in your own life.""

Jamie Lee Curtis and Christopher Guest

Jamie Lee Curtis and the mockumentary director Christopher Guest tied the knot in 1984 and have two children.

When asked about the secret to staying together, Curtis told the ""Today"" show in 2015, ""Don't get divorced""

""It's a fascinating thing,"" she said. ""I could write a book on marriage called 'Don't Leave.'""

Carey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford

Mulligan and Mumford, of the band Mumford and Sons, married in 2012 and are known for keeping their relationship private.

Luckily, their friend Sienna Miller has seen enough to shed some light for their fans.

""They have chickens and a dog, and roasts and friends, jams by campfires. It's sort of idyllic,"" she told Vogue. ""Marcus can headline Glastonbury and Carey can be nominated for however many Oscars, and then they come back to their farm, and they're in big woolly jumpers and funny hats, raising piglets.""

Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz

Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz have been married since 2010 and are often seen together on music's hottest red carpets.

When Keys made a statement by going makeup-free to the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, Swizz defended his wife against any haters.

""Y'all gotta think about that. This is deep,"" he said in an Instagram video. ""Somebody's sitting at home mad, because somebody didn't wear makeup on their face — not your face, but they didn't put makeup on their face, because they just didn't feel like wearing makeup.""

Carrie Preston and Michael Emerson

Carrie Preston from ""True Blood"" wed Michael Emerson, aka Ben Linus from ""Lost,"" back in 1998.

They may not have kids, but they do have a very special someone in their lives: their dog Chumley.

""Michael and I have been together for going on 22 years,"" Preston told Us Weekly in 2016. ""We talk about our lives B.C. and A.C. — Before Chumley and After Chumley.""

Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy

Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy got married in 1997, making their marriage one of the longest-lasting in Hollywood. They have two children together, daughters named Sophia and Georgia.

Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy

The couple wed in 2009 and had their only son, Cyrus, in 2012.

Despite being married for almost 10 years, Danes says she's still learning.

""Marriage is wonderful. It's challenging, and … it just keeps getting deeper. I keep learning more things about him and myself, and that's not always comfortable,"" Danes said during a 2015 interview with Entertainment Tonight. ""But I have this incredible security, and it's a huge asset to have a partnership with someone you trust and admire — and want to make out with.""

Kyra Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon

The two actors, who starred in the movie ""Lemon Sky,"" wed in 1988. They have two children together, a son named Travis and a daughter named Sosie.

Sedgwick and Bacon continue to support each other on red carpets for their projects and aren't afraid to be silly together on social media.

Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart

They met at the 2002 Golden Globes and have been married for more than 10 years. The actors have a 22-year age gap, but to them, it's not a big deal.

""It doesn't faze me,"" Flockhart told Hello! magazine in 2003. ""Sometimes I even say, 'Wow, I keep forgetting that he's [22] years older than me.' It doesn't factor into our relationship at all.""

Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen

""The Good Place"" actor Ted Danson and ""The Proposal"" star Mary Steenburgen have been married for more than two decades.

They met through Danson's audition for the 1983 film ""Cross Creek"" but didn't date at the time.

""I was married. He was married. That was not our moment,"" Steenburgen told People magazine in 2021.

Sure enough, the actors reconnected — as costars in the 1993 film ""Pontiac Moon."" They wed two years later.

""I want as long as possible in my life with Mary,"" Danson told People magazine. ""I know it will have all of its hard parts but I want to experience love in all those moments.""

Jameela Jamil and James Blake

They were first linked in 2015 when Jamil posted a photo of them celebrating her birthday in LA. Since then, they've stepped out together on red carpets and posted about each other on Instagram.

In 2015, Blake told Dazed magazine that the ""Good Place"" star, who never minces words on social media, encouraged him to say how he really feels and be outspoken.

Meanwhile, Jamil said on Emma Gannon's ""Ctrl Alt Delete"" podcast, that her boyfriend taught her ""to stick up for myself.""

She also told Meghan Markle that the Grammy-winning musician is a ""great source of strength and comfort.""

""He's incredibly supportive of me, and you know he's been a big encourager of me to learn how to fight back and speak my mind and understand my worth, and he's just a great ally,"" Jamil said.

The Belgian actor who won a top Cannes prize for her breakout role in “Rosetta,” Émilie Dequenne has died at 43

Belgian Actor Émilie Dequenne Dies at 43 of Rare Cancer, Report Says

Émilie Dequenne, the Belgian actor who won a top Cannes Film Festival prize for her breakout role in “Rosetta,” has died, a news report says. She was 43.

Her family and agent told the news agency Agence France-Presse that Dequenne died Sunday of a rare cancer in a hospital outside of Paris. In 2023, Dequenne revealed she had been diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma. Representatives for Dequenne did not immediately respond to inquires from The Associated Press on Monday. 

Dequenne was only 18 when she was selected as best actress at Cannes in 1999. In “Rosetta,” from Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, she portrayed a teenager trying to escape her difficult life in a caravan park with an alcoholic mother. The film also won the Palme d'Or that year.

Born in Belœil, Belgium, in 1981, Dequenne had a performance streak from a young age. She studied drama at the Académie de Musique de Baudour.

She became well-known in France after starring alongside Catherine Deneuve in “The Girl on the Train,” in 2009, based on the true story of a woman who falsely claimed she was the victim of an antisemitic attack. Dequenne also portrayed police officer Laurence Renauld on the French series “The Missing.”

In 2012, she won the Un Certain Regard actress prize from Cannes for “Our Children,” a dark psychological drama inspired by the real story of a Belgian woman who killed her five children. She was also nominated for several César Awards throughout her career, finally winning best supporting actress in 2021 for the romantic comedy “Love Affair(s).”

Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the difficult role in “Our Children,” she said, “For my part I went home every weekend, and stayed with my family, which is a very safe place. Making a film like that is something that you have to survive.”

More recently, she co-starred in “Close,” Lukas Dhont's tender boyhood drama, which brought her back to Cannes again in 2022. She saw similarities between her young co-star and her own breakout role with “Rosetta.”

“For me to be here and to come back here after 23 years, it's very emotional and there is like a reflection between Eden (Dambrine) and myself because I remember when I was here the first time with ‘Rosetta,'” she told The Associated Press. “It was like a very powerful movie with this main character, which is in every scene, every, every shot. And that's the same for him.”

Dequenne returned to the festival again in 2024 for the 25th anniversary of “Rosetta.” Her last film was Frédéric Jardin's post-apocalyptic thriller “Survive,” which came out earlier this year.

While she loved taking on work in England, France and Belgium, she had little interest in Hollywood.

“I have been to Hollywood and had meetings, but really they don't do the kind of films I like to make. And everything is kind of boring, no?” she said in the interview with The Guardian. “Honestly, it's not a fun place, or at least not my kind of fun.”

She is survived by her husband, director and producer Michel Ferracci, and daughter, Milla Savarese.

The date for Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter tour stop in Las Vegas has been released.

On Monday (March 17), Bey announced that she will be headed to Vegas to perform at Allegiant Stadium on July 25 as part of her Cowboy Carter tour.

Live Nation confirmed the addition on Monday and noted that Bey's highly anticipated tour is 94 percent sold out amid rumors that the 35-time Grammy winner was struggling to sell tickets.

Fans can get early access to the Vegas tickets through the BeyHive presale, which runs from Thursday (March 20) through Sunday (March 23). Artist presale begins March 24 and ends March 25. Citi cardmember and Verizon Access presales begin Friday (March 21) and run through March 23.

The newly announced Vegas date comes after Bey shared a flyer advertising the Cowboy Carter Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour that highlighted Sin City as one of the stops. Fans speculated that the singer might be performing at The Sphere in Vegas after the initial ticket drop didn't include the city.

During her Cowboy Carter tour, Bey will also be heading to stadiums in New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Atlanta, Washington D.C., Paris, London, and Chicago. Beyoncé is set to perform songs from her latest album, which took home three Grammys last month.

Tom Cruise and Ana de Armas keep fanning the flame when it comes to romance rumors.

The Top Gun star, 62, and the Deep Water actress, 36, were all smiles when arriving at the London Heliport together on Friday, March 14, per photos obtained by People. The actors, who arrived via helicopter, were spotted ""chatting and laughing"" with the staff, according to the outlet. The pair, who both wore casual, dark ensembles for the outing, had also been spotted at the heliport one day prior.

Cruise and de Armas' latest outing comes one month after they initially sparked romance rumors in London over Valentine's Day weekend.

The stars reportedly grabbed dinner at the time — another night out in which they appeared to be in good spirits, with the Mission: Impossible star greeting fans and taking photos with them. He and de Armas were once again photographed smiling.

At the time of their February get-together, however, a source told People that Cruise and de Armas were ""discussing potential collaborations down the line"" — adding that they ""appeared to have no romantic connection, just friends.""

While the nature of Cruise and de Armas' relationship has yet to be determined, both actors have had their dating lives take center stage in the public eye.

The Jerry Maguire star, for his part, was married to Nicole Kidman from from 1990 to 2001, and shares two adult children with her: daughter Bella, 32, son Connor, 30. He went on to wed Katie Holmes in 2006 before the couple divorced in 2012. Cruise and the Dawson's Creek alum share daughter Suri, 18. He was last linked to model Elsina Khayrova in 2024.

De Armas, meanwhile, dated Ben Affleck from March 2020 to September 2020. She was most recently linked to Manuel Anido in 2024.

While Taylor Swift continues to make headlines, so do those who were once part of the superstar's orbit — from ex-boyfriends to her one-time BFF Karlie Kloss, now expecting baby number three.

The 32-year-old model, who is married to Joshua Kushner, 39, announced the news that she is pregnant by posting a black-and-white photograph on Instagram. In the shot — captioned ""Three's a party"" — Kloss holds her 19-month-old son, Elijah, and is wearing a button-down shirt baring her growing belly.

In addition to Elijah, Kloss and her husband of six years are parents to Levi, who turned 4 this month.

Other photos in the carousel include a close-up shot of the Kode with Klossy founder cradling her bare stomach, another of her dressed in a floor-length black gown that shows off her expanding profile, and a third of her two sons.

A post shared by Karlie Kloss (@karliekloss)

In a November 2023 interview with People, Kloss opened up about her last pregnancy, revealing she struggled with her posture and had to relearn her ""whole anatomy"" in order to fix the issue and straighten her back.

Kloss was famously part of Taylor Swift's ""Girl Squad"" that included Gigi Hadid, Selena Gomez and other stars — with the two best friends even embarking on a road trip together featured in Vogue — but the once-close pals appeared to fall out with each other as early as 2017. Their rift has been highly-publicized over the years, among both fans and stars alike. Even Jennifer Lawrence quipped in a 2018 interview that she was lying awake at night wondering ""what happened"" to lead to the pair's possible estrangement.

""I'd like to know what's going on with Karlie Kloss and Taylor Swift, that's the honest to God truth. Is nobody else curious? It's keeping me up at night. What happened?"" - Jennifer Lawrence [@TimesTalks]

It remains to be seen if Swift and her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, will also become parents together someday, but his mother, Donna Kelce, shared with Entertainment Tonight that the NFL star definitely wants kids of his own.

In a 2023 interview with the outlet, Donna revealed that whether Travis, 35, or his older brother Jason Kelce, 37, was her favorite has depended on where they were in life.

At the time, she revealed that Jason was ""a little ahead"" because he gave her grandchildren (the former Philadelphia Eagles player and his wife Kylie Kelce now share three daughters — Wyatt, 5, Elliotte, 4, and Bennett, 3 —and they're expecting a fourth later this year).

However, Donna added, ""I'm sure Travis will take it over soon.""

The 98th Academy Awards has officially found its host — and it's a very familiar face.

It was announced on Monday (March 17) that Conan O'Brien will return as host for the 2026 Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, following up his successful stint as first-time host at the 97th Academy Awards earlier this month, per People. In true Conan fashion, the 61-year-old comedian celebrated the news by joking about the ""only reason"" he was returning to host.

""The only reason I'm hosting the Oscars next year is that I want to hear Adrien Brody finish his speech,"" he said in a press release, referencing the actor's lengthy Best Actor acceptance speech during the 2025 Oscars.

During his first time as Oscars host, the show drew in a five-year high of more than 19 million viewers who tuned in to watch O'Brien take on some of the year's biggest films and pop culture moments as well as see which of their favorite movies and actors took home awards during the night.

In addition to O'Brien, the Academy is bringing back executive producers Raj Kapoor and Katy Mullan as well as Jeff Ross and Mike Sweeney as producers, with the latter also serving as a member of the writing team. 

""We are thrilled to bring back Conan, Raj, Katy, Jeff and Mike for the 98th Oscars!"" Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Janet Yang said in a statement. ""This year, they produced a hugely entertaining and visually stunning show that celebrated our nominees and the global film community in the most beautiful and impactful way. Conan was the perfect host — skillfully guiding us through the evening with humor, warmth and reverence. It is an honor to be working with them again.""

The 2026 Oscars will air on ABC Sunday, March 15, 2026.","{'href': 'https://kiisfm.iheart.com', 'title': 'On Air with Ryan Seacrest'}"

Rachel Zegler is paying tribute to the original Snow White.

The actress, who plays the Disney Princess in the upcoming live-action remake, took to Instagram to honor Adriana Caselotti, the actress who voiced the character in the 1937 animated classic film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

""just had to pay homage to the original snow white, miss adriana caselotti, to whom i owe everything,"" Zegler wrote.

The carousel includes a photo where Zegler styled her hair with curls and a red bow clip. After that is a black-and-white photo of Caselotti sharing a similar hairstyle. Rounding out the post is a video of Zegler, wearing the same ensemble, looking off to the side before staring into the camera and laughing.

Caselotti was named a Disney Legend in 1994. Thought of as Disney's first ingenue of the animated screen, she voiced both the speaking and singing voice of the animated princess. She died in 1997.

Gal Gadot stars alongside Zegler in the live-action remake. It arrives in movie theaters on March 21.

Chrissy Teigen offered a few choice words to haters in a new message calling out social media users who cannot keep their negative thoughts to themselves. 

The model and mother-of-four took to Instagram on Saturday (March 15) to relay her distaste, calling out people who relentlessly criticize her appearance. 

""Stop being miserable. Honestly like what happened to just thinking things? Remember thinking things? You'd go through a magazine, you'd be like, ‘Oh, that person looks like s***. Ugh, I would never have that haircut. Bleh, those teeth suck.' We all do it, but we used to do it to, like, magazines, and then we spit it out and it would go into the universe and it would disappear,"" she remarked in a lengthy rant shared to her Instagram Story (obtained by People). 

Teigen, wife to music sensation John Legend, proceeded to sarcastically mock haters before concluding: 

""Just say those things inside, in your head. Say them inside your big brain. Your big brain is so ready for all your thoughts, but you don't let them keep anything in because you're spewing them out. Keep those big, beautiful thoughts to yourself. Keep them inside.""

Teigen did not zoom in on a specific instance that sparked the conversation but felt it necessary to offer a blanket note to haters amid a continuous stream of online ridicule.

DUBLIN (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of people packed the streets of Dublin on Monday to watch Ireland's national St. Patrick's Day parade, as crowds in green flooded cities and towns across the country to honor the country's patron saint.

Officials said half a million spectators were expected to line the parade route in the capital to watch the colorful floats, performers and dancers. Many waved the Irish tricolor flag or had it painted on their faces, while others sported leprechaun hats and all shades of green.

Some 4,000 people and 12 marching bands from across Ireland, North America and Austria took part in the parade this year.

While the tradition of St. Patrick's Day parades first began among Irish immigrant communities in the United States in the 1700s, and the biggest parade these days takes place in New York City, officials say the holiday draws some 100,000 tourists to Ireland each year.

Smaller parades also took place in cities from Limerick to Cork and Belfast in Northern Ireland.

In London, Kate, the Princess of Wales, sported a forest green long coat with matching hat as she marked the occasion with a solo visit to the Irish Guards at Wellington Barracks.

The royal, who is the ceremonial colonel of the regiment, presented fresh shamrock sprigs and awarded medals to soldiers before the regiment's St. Patrick's Day parade. She enjoyed a half pint of Guinness afterward as she chatted and joked with the soldiers.

Kate, who missed the Guards' celebrations last year after she was diagnosed with cancer, has gradually returned to public duties.

Lijomol Jose and Losliya Mariyanesan's Tamil crime thriller Gentlewoman is preparing for its digital release after its theatrical run. The film, written and directed by Joshua Sethuraman, was released in cinemas on March 7 and received mixed-to-positive reviews from audiences and critics. The storyline, which revolves around betrayal and revenge, struck a chord with viewers, leading to discussions about its intense narrative. After its stint in theatres, Gentlewoman is set to make its way to the streaming platform Tentkotta, providing audiences an opportunity to watch it online.

The film Gentlewoman will be available for streaming on Tentkotta, a platform known for hosting Tamil films. While an official streaming date is yet to be confirmed, reports indicate that the digital premiere will take place towards the end of March or early April. Fans who missed the theatrical release will soon have the chance to watch the thriller from the comfort of their homes.

The trailer of Gentlewoman set the tone for a gripping crime drama, showcasing the story of Poorni, played by Lijomol Jose, a newlywed woman trapped in an abusive marriage. Her husband, Aravind, portrayed by Hari Krishnan, not only mistreats her but is also involved in an affair with Anna, played by Losliya Mariyanesan. The plot thickens when Poorni discovers the betrayal and an altercation in the kitchen leads to Aravind's sudden disappearance. As the police begin their investigation, Poorni finds herself caught in a web of deception, forcing her to navigate a dangerous path filled with unexpected twists.

The film features Lijomol Jose and Losliya Mariyanesan in lead roles, supported by Hari Krishnan, R. Rajiv Gandhi, Dharani, Vairabalan, Nandithaa Sreekumar, and Sudesh. Produced by Komala Hari, Hari Bhaskaran, PN Narenthra Kumar, and Leo Logame Nethaji, Gentlewoman has cinematography handled by Sa Kathavarayan. The editing has been done by Elayaraja Sekar, while the background score and music have been composed by Govind Vasantha.

Since its theatrical release, Gentlewoman has received a rating of 7.9/10 on IMDb, reflecting a largely positive reception from viewers. Audience feedback highlights the film's engaging storyline and strong performances, particularly from Lijomol Jose. Critics have praised the screenplay and direction, though some reviews pointed out pacing issues in certain sections.

Cassie Ventura is expecting a baby boy.

The 38-year-old actress already has daughters Frankie, five, and Sunny, three, with Alex Fine and revealed while celebrating her husband's birthday that they are going to have their first son.

She wrote on Instagram: ""There aren't words to describe how grateful I am that I get to do this life with you! The laughter and pure joy that I get to experience with you is beyond any of my dreams and manifestations. You've taken care of me and my heart like no other, you're hands down the best girl dad and I'm SO excited to see you now become a father to OUR SON!""

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/DHJULX-RiFu/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==[/embed]

Cassie first announced her pregnancy in July.

At the time, she shared a series of images from a professional photoshoot to show off her blossoming baby bump with her two young children sweetly seen cosying up to their mom's bare pregnant stomach and her husband hugging her belly.

Cassie simply captioned the post ""#3"" along with a pregnant lady and blue heart emoji, signifying the gender of the unborn tot.

The couple's exciting baby news came after a difficult time for Cassie as she's had to relive her ordeal with embattled ex Sean 'Diddy' Combs.

Diddy was hit with allegations including physical abuse by Cassie in a November 2023 lawsuit, which he settled out of court a day after it was lodged.

Thanking people for their support, Cassie wrote in a statement shared to Instagram days later: ""Thank you for all of the love and support from my family, friends, strangers and those I have yet to meet.

""The outpouring of love has created a place for my younger self to settle and feel safe now, but this is only the beginning. Domestic Violence is THE issue.

""It broke me down to someone I never thought I would become. With a lot of hard work, I am better today, but I will always be recovering from my past.""

Justin Bieber thought he was ""drowning"" amid the ""hate"" he felt after being ""hurt"".

The 31-year-old singer - who has been the subject of months of speculation about his physical and mental health - has shared an emotional post in which he reflected on the conflicting feelings he has expressing negative emotions because of his childhood experiences.

He shared a message on his Instagram story which read: “I was always told when I was a kid not to hate. But it made me feel like I wasn't allowed to have it and so I didn't tell anyone I've had it.

“Which made me feel like I have been drowning feeling unsafe to acknowledge it. I think we can only let hate go by first acknowledging it's there. How couldn't we feel hate from all of the hurt we have experienced?(sic)""

The 'Peaches' hitmaker accompanied the post with SZA's track 'I Hate U'.

Justin's social media admission came days after he told fans he felt like a ""fraud"" and had struggled with imposter syndrome.

He wrote on Instagram: “People told me my whole life, ‘Wow, Justin, you deserve that'. And I personally have always felt unworthy, like I was a fraud, like when people told me I deserve something.

“It made me feel sneaky, like, damn, if they only knew my thoughts. How judgmental I am, how selfish I really am... they wouldn't be saying this.

“I say all this to say, if you feel sneaky, welcome to the club. I definitely feel unequipped and unqualified most days.”

Last month, the 'Baby' singer's representative slammed speculation about the star's health and insisted rumours Justin - who has seven-month-old son Jack Blues with wife Hailey Bieber - had been using hard drugs were ""absolutely not true"".

The spokesperson added to TMZ: ""[The last year has been] very transformative for him as he ended several close friendships and business relationships that no longer served him.""

Of the stories about his health, they added: ""[It's] exhausting and pitiful and shows that despite the obvious truth, people are committed to keeping negative, salacious, harmful narratives alive.""

And recently, Justin declared it's ""time to grow up"" in a cryptic post in which he admitted he is ""not good"" at following rules but he's determined to embrace a ""life of love"" as he follows his Christian faith.

He wrote on Instagram: ""It's time to grow up. Changing is about letting go! Not trying harder! Are you tired of trying to follow all of the rules in hopes to get the results you crave? I've found love to be more powerful than rules.”

He added: ""I tried to follow the rules. I'm not good at it. But u don't need to follow rules to enter into a life of love. U just receive so enter love living! God always grants us love! It's one of his promises! Upon receiving God's love! U start to change and start following love.(sic)""

Justin Theroux has married Nicole Brydon Bloom.

The 53-year-old actor got engaged to Nicole, 30, in August 2024 after just over a year of dating and now they have tied the knot, according to TMZ.

The outlet obtained photos of the couple in Tulum, Mexico, where Justin was seen wearing a cream tuxedo and kissing Nicole as she danced in a traditional wedding dress.

The outlet claimed that the couple had to contend with windy weather conditions but claimed that they had it on ""good authority"" that the pair are now husband and wife.

The couple were first romantically linked in February 2023 and attended the Venice movie festival to promote his new film Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, which was released in September 2024.

They made their red-carpet debut as a couple in March at the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, wearing matching all-black outfits.

They were also photographed getting cosy on a night out in New York City in August 2023, and next month were spotted getting dinner with Nicole's parents.

Justin's exes include Friends actress Jennifer Aniston, 55, to whom he was married from 2015 to 2018.

The exes are said to have stayed friendly after their split and were spotted getting dinner together at the Il Cantinori restaurant in New York last April.

Justin told the New York Times about their break-up: ""The good news is that was probably the most — I'm choosing my words really carefully — it was kind of the most gentle separation, in that there was no animosity.""

Nicole is best known for playing Caroline Stuyvesant in season two of The Gilded Age, and has also appeared in Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, 1BR and We Were the Lucky Ones.

Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Naga Chaitanya may have separated from each other, but the discussion over them is not ending anytime soon. After about 4 years of marriage, both of them got divorced in 2021. At the same time, last year, Chaitanya married South Indian actress Sobhita Dhulipala and started his life afresh. After this decision of Chaitanya, now it seems that Samantha wants to erase all the memories related to her ex-husband. 






For the unversed, Samantha had already turned her white wedding gown into a black off-shoulder dress and her wedding ring into a pendent, but now it seems like the actor has also decided to erase the joint tattoos that the actors got together while they were married.

On Sunday, March 16, Samantha shared some glimpses of her upcoming film on her official Instagram account. In these pictures, the tattoo on her wrist has caught people's attention; two arrow tattoos are seen on the actress's wrist, which have faded to a great extent. This tattoo matches Naga Chaitanya's tattoo. This was a sign of her love with Naga Chaitanya. Let us tell you that years ago, both of them got the same design tattooed on their respective hands.





These pictures of Samantha are trending on social media. Social media users speculated that the actress had decided to remove it. In the comment section of Samantha's latest post, a fan wrote, 'Good, never get a tattoo of your partner's name, guys. You never know when the relationship will end, and removing a tattoo is painful.' Another user wrote, 'It's good for them.' Another user wrote, 'Hope you make a great start.'

Samantha and Naga Chaitanya tied the knot in 2017. Before marriage, both of them got the same design tattooed on their right hand, the meaning of this tattoo was, 'Create your own reality.' After their marriage, Chaitanya added their wedding date in Morse code to his tattoo. At the same time, Samantha got a tattoo of 'YMC' on her neck for her Telugu debut 'Ye Maya Chesaave', where she first met Chaitanya.

TORONTO - Longtime former ""Breakfast Television"" co-host Dina Pugliese is settling back into the chair.

Pugliese announced her return on the show Monday by stepping onto the set in a moose costume before removing the mascot-style head to raucous cheers from the crew.

Pugliese will also serve as a co-executive producer on the program, which she left in February 2023 after 16 years citing burnout.

Citytv says Pugliese will anchor the show alongside Tim Bolen, who hosted CHCH's ""Morning Live"" until earlier this year.

The move comes just over a month after ""BT"" hosts Meredith Shaw and Sid Seixeiro abruptly departed the show.

That move came just weeks after the network axed a planned extension to ""Breakfast Television"" that would have featured two other high-profile hosts, Cheryl Hickey and Tracy Moore.

This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 17, 2025.

Made in Canada.

Three words that are now a common presence on Canadian shelves, after Donald Trump's tariffs sparked a trade war with the US's northern neighbour.

In Canada the economic measures against it have been met with a wave of patriotism, with some consumers and businesses boycotting American products. 

Others with operations in the US face a choice - ride out the uncertainty or bring their enterprise back home.

""Right now, I'm a little angry. I don't want to invest in American companies,"" says Joanna Goodman, owner of Au Lit Fine Linens, a Toronto-based bedding and nightwear company.

""It's about having your eggs in one basket. And right now, that basket is very reckless and very precarious,"" she continues.

On a tour around one of her firm's two stores, housed in a giant warehouse, Ms Goodman highlights elegantly made-up beds, mannequins in silk pyjamas, and shelves full of sweet-smelling candles – most of it made in Canada.

But one fifth of the stock currently comes from the US. Ms Goodman is quick to point out, ""you see how big the store is, so even 20% is a lot"".

""I have a lot of inventory here of American brands that I've had relationships with for 20 years. I'm not going to throw it away,"" she says. ""The question is, will I reorder?""

To show Au Lit Fine Linens' commitment to Canadian manufacturers, its stores now highlight everything that is Canadian made. This is mirrored on its website, which has a ""shop all made in Canada"" section, and says ""made right here at home"".

From Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, to the Ukraine war, global events in recent years have given rise to a more recent phenomenon – reshoring.

Bringing business operations back to home shores, it is the reversal of offshoring.

Business leader and recently-appointed new member of Canada's Senate, Sandra Pupatello, says that reshoring is ""really obvious"" to support.

Pupatello, who had previously been Ontario's Minister of Economic Development and Trade, points to the Covid-19 pandemic, when rules of trade ""went right out the window"".

She specifically cites the example of US mask manufacturer 3M coming under pressure from the White House in 2020 to halt exports to Canada and Latin America.

In that moment Pupatello thought: ""We've got to be prepared for the worst"".

Shortly after, she established Reshoring Canada, a non-partisan group advocating for a more resilient supply chain in Canada.

Pupatello tells the BBC: ""If the going gets tough, Canada is on its own. And if we know that's the case, let us plan for it.""

A Canadian government report from last year found that there had ""not been signs of either large-scale or any notable increased reshoring by businesses"", but things could now be changing.

Ray Brougham has been trying to make inroads into the Canadian car manufacturing sector since establishing his company Rainhouse Manufacturing Canada in 2001. Based in British Columbia, it manufactures parts for a number of industries.

The North American car industry's integrated supply chains can see parts crossing the borders between the US, Mexico, and Canada multiple times before a vehicle is finally assembled.

US President Donald Trump said he would temporarily spare US carmakers from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico, just a day after the tariffs came into effect in March.

But in the shadow of a trade war, Mr Brougham says he has had ""good communications"" with a large Canadian auto parts company for the first time ever. ""All of a sudden they are interested in working closer with other Canadian companies.""

For Mr Brougham and others, the benefits of reshoring are clear. From giving a leg up to small companies that have struggled to compete with manufacturers overseas, to ensuring fair wages, and the environmental benefits of importing and exporting fewer goods.

Others, including Graham Markham, director of a food sector supplier, believe it's about adding value to products Canada already produces.

His Canadian firm New Protein International is currently constructing Canada's first soy protein manufacturing plant in southwest Ontario, just miles from the US border.

Canada is the world's fourth-largest exporter of the crop, but most of it is processed overseas.

""We don't process those value-added ingredients into more valuable ingredients here at home,"" says Mr Markham.

From critical minerals and uranium to lumber and soybeans, he argues that this is the moment to change.

""Canada has long been a successful supplier of raw materials to the world. The opportunity now is to stop exporting the job creation and innovation that comes from processing those materials domestically.""

So, could manufacturing start coming back to Canada?  Economist Randall Bartlett says it is too early to tell.

""There's a lot more smoke than there is fire when it comes to actual reorganisation of supply chains and moving them domestically,"" says Mr Bartlett, senior director of Canadian economics at Quebec-based Desjardins.

""I think there has been some movement toward reshoring, but I think there's a lot more narrative around it than there is actual re-establishing of manufacturing capacity.""

There are major hurdles too.

The highly-integrated auto industry, for example, would take years to untangle. Reshoring it would require ""many tens of hundreds of billions of dollars in both private and public sector investment to make happen"", according to Mr Bartlett.

Then there's the reality of global trade.

""Some countries are better at producing some things than other countries are,"" Mr Bartlett says, suggesting that rather than a full reshoring push, diversifying Canada's trade partners might be more practical.

He says that Canada should focus on ""those industries where we have a comparative advantage"", which he says include renewable energy and processing steel and aluminium. Those two metals have now been hit with a 25% tariff if they are exported to the US.

Back at Au Lit Fine Linens in Toronto, Joanna Goodman steps into a vast stockroom, filled with the sound of carboard boxes being packed.

""We're shipping orders to the US that came in pre-tariffs,"" she explains, before pausing.  ""We did get an order the day of the tariffs starting, and it was a very decent-sized order.""

She says that she doesn't know whether the US buyer understands that tariffs will now apply. ""He has to ask Mr Trump [why]"".

As for what comes next?  ""These tariffs could be gone any day. Let's see how it all unfolds, then we'll start making decisions,"" says Ms Goodman.

Like many Canadian businesses, she's waiting for the dust to settle before deciding where to buy, where to sell, and what Made in Canada really means for the future.

The King, who is also head of state of Canada, meets the country's new prime minister Mark Carney amid a trade war with the US. 

Canada's new PM meets King Charles at Buckingham Palace, before talks with UK PM Starmer.

Trump's tariffs will hit its biggest steel trading partners' economies the most, the OECD predicts.

Carney described Canada as the ""most European of non-European countries"".

US stores will remain open as Forever 21's operating company ""begins its process of ""winding down"".

Flagging global sales and Elon Musk's increasingly outspoken political activities are combining to rock the value of Tesla.

Shares in the once-trillion-dollar company saw their worst day in five years this week. Year to date, Tesla's stock has plunged 41% — though it is still up by about 36% over the past 12 months.

On Monday, the stock was down another 5%. 

For Musk, Tesla's shares remain his primary source of paper wealth, though he has also turned his stake in SpaceX into a personal lending tool. But it was proceeds from selling Tesla shares that helped Musk complete his acquisition of Twitter, now known as X.

Musk's wealth also allowed him to help vault Donald Trump into a second presidential term. Even as Musk's net worth has diminished as a result of Tesla's recent share-price declines, data suggests he is in no danger of losing his title as the world's wealthiest person.

Musk has said on X that he is not concerned about Tesla's recent drop in value. Still, evidence suggests the company is entering a period of transition.

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Musk's wealth has propelled him to a global presence that lacks precedent — and has polarized world opinion about the tech entrepreneur in the process. Any weakening of his financial position, therefore, could undercut his influence in the political and tech spaces where he now commands outsize attention.According to Bank of America, Tesla's European sales plummeted by about 50% in January compared with the same month a year prior.

Some say this is attributable to a growing distaste for Musk, who has begun dabbling in the continent's politics in the wake of his successful support of Trump's candidacy last year.

Others note Tesla's European market is facing increased competition from the Chinese electric-vehicle maker BYD, which has telegraphed ambitious plans for expansion on the continent.  

A more decisive blow to Tesla's near-term fortunes may be emanating from China itself. There, Tesla's shipments plunged 49% in February from a year earlier, to just 30,688 vehicles, according to official data cited by Bloomberg News. That's the lowest monthly figure registered since July 2022 — amid the throes of Covid-19 — when it shipped just 28,217 EVs, Bloomberg said.

Tesla is now facing intense competition from other Chinese EV makers, including BYD.

Yet even there, a Chinese official also warned about the impact of Musk's high-profile politicking.

“As a successful businessman, one should be embracing 100% of the market: Treat everyone nicely, and everyone will be nice in return,” the secretary of China's Passenger Car Association, said in a briefing Monday, Bloomberg reported. “But if you look at it in terms of voting, then half of voters will be friendly to you and half of them won't be.”

“This is the unavoidable risk that's come after he got his personal glory,” the secretary, Cui Dongshu, said Monday, referring to Musk.

On Friday, Reuters reported Tesla was planning to sell a Model Y costing at least 20% less to produce to defend its China share.

And in the U.S., Tesla's January sales were down about 11%, according to data from the S&P Global analytics group — an outlier at a time when EV sales for all other brands are trending higher in America.

Though he has long worn multiple proverbial hats, Musk's role in the White House as nominal head of the Department of Government Efficiency may be his most consequential. And having influence with the Trump administration could be critical to Tesla's fortunes. This week, Trump promised he would purchase a Tesla in a showy presentation on the White House lawn, seemingly further cementing the Trump-Musk alliance.

On X — the social media platform he owns — Musk's frenetic posting is increasingly focused on politics and America's culture wars, with an occasional nod to SpaceX launches.

His apparently undiminished role in the Trump administration — he was seen leaving the White House last weekend alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick — has sparked boycotts in Europe, as well as protests and even acts of vandalism against auto owners in the U.S.

“When people's cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent to Musk might think twice about buying a Tesla,” Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, told CNBC's “Squawk on the Street” on Monday.

In a note to clients this week downgrading its estimate of deliveries, analysts with JPMorgan said the damage to Tesla's brand has been serious.

“We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,” they wrote.

Tesla itself is warning about the fallout from retaliatory measures taken by countries targeted by Trump's tariffs, saying in a letter to the U.S. trade representative this week that the company may be “exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions.”

Already, the Canadian province of British Columbia has announced it was ending subsidies for Tesla's products.

For all the oxygen Musk has taken up with his political activities, concerns about Tesla products themselves are equally keeping investors and analysts up at night.

Musk has “neglect[ed] the rest of Tesla's automotive business as he thought that by the end of every year for the last 6 years, Tesla would be able to flip a switch and make all its vehicles self-driving — automatically increasing their value and making them infinitely more competitive than other vehicles,” Fred Lambert, who covers the company for the Electrek electric vehicle blog, wrote in a recent post.

Meanwhile, Musk decided to kill Tesla's cheaper, $25,000 model while going all-in on the Cybertruck, whose sales have yet to take off, Lambert said.

“Tesla's core business remains selling cars and batteries,” he wrote. “There's no doubt that the business of selling cars is not going well for Tesla right now, and under Musk, there's no clear path to improvement.”

By contrast, many analysts continue to take a much longer view of Tesla's outlook. In his most recent note to clients about the company, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, one of the most closely watched observers of Tesla, summarized the long-term outlook that he says continues to justify the company's eye-watering valuation.

“Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive ‘pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,” he wrote in a note March 2.

While that was before the most recent sell-off intensified, Jonas said he was already discounting market gyrations.

“While the journey may be volatile and non-linear, we believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage,” he wrote.

If you're thinking of starting a new business and need advice on what to do, your first move should be turning to an artificial intelligence chatbot tool, like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude.

That's according to Steve Blank, who has written four books on the subject of entrepreneurship. He helped build eight different tech startups, of which he co-founded four, before retiring over two decades ago. His final startup, business software company Epiphany, sold to SSA Global Technologies for $329 million in 2005.

Blank is currently an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where he teaches courses on innovation and his Lean Startup method.

For years, Steve Blank has advised students and the founders he advises to ""get the heck outside"" of the office or classroom to talk to actual potential customers and find out what it is they want and build their prospective businesses accordingly. Now, he says, AI's generative tech can make that process even more effective.

""AI [is] a force multiplier to everything you do,"" Blank tells CNBC Make It. ""AI could help you figure out where to get outside, probably faster than anything else. If you have a business idea, [ask] something like ChatGPT: 'I have Idea X, has anybody done it? Why hasn't [it] worked? Where should I best do this?'""

In addition to summarizing market research and offering feedback, some AI chatbots can write you a whole business plan. That free feature in ChatGPT, as well as in other platforms like Grammarly and Canva, can help give you a significant boost without the need to pay thousands of dollars for a freelance business consultant, Blank says.

""Just imagine you have Steve Blank over your shoulder, helping you ask these questions,"" says Blank. With AI, ""you have at your fingertips a pretty good consultant [who] in the past would have charged you $10,000.""

Though they have made rapid advances in recent years, AI tools are still far from foolproof. Their responses frequently include errors known as ""hallucinations."" Blank advises that anyone turning to AI for a business plan take recommendations with a grain of salt.

""Somewhere between 10% and 50% of their answers are bullshit, sure. And the problem is you don't know which ones,"" Blank says. One 2023 study from AI startup Vectara found that chatbots hallucinate as much as 27% of the time, while a recent BBC study found that roughly half of AI assistants' answers to news-related questions contained errors.

Even if they're far from perfect, though, Blank argues that these tools still have plenty of value, particularly for first-time entrepreneurs who want to move forward with a business idea and aren't entirely sure what steps to take. He compares getting business feedback from AI tools to ""having a pretty smart friend who's kind of riffing."" Maybe every single suggestion they have isn't brilliant, but they could give you some good starting points you might not have thought of on your own.

""If you take everything at face value, you might drive over the cliff, but they're giving you some great ideas to think about, particularly if you've really never done this before,"" Blank says.

Feed a few simple initial questions into an AI tool, he suggests: The answers generated can help give you some clarity about whether there is a legitimate ""product-market fit"" for your idea. For example:

AI-generated insights should never be a stand-in for boots-on-the-ground research, Blank says — putting in that work remains essential for any entrepreneur mapping out a new business. The crux of the ""lean startup"" method Blank has taught for decades is speaking with a cross-section of potential customers and clients as early in the ideation process as possible, and then using their feedback to determine the viability of any concept.

AI still ""doesn't eliminate the need for getting out and testing the fundamental assumptions,"" Blank says. ""Whether it's a restaurant or a consulting business or gardening store or whatever, you have a set of assumptions. The most important one is: 'Well, who are my customers?' And the second one is: 'What do they want?'""

Answering those questions before moving ahead with a business idea is essential, because they speak to the fundamental focus and strength of any potential business, Blank says. Not doing so is a major mistake that can doom a new company before it launches.

That said, prospective business owners who are unwilling to use AI tools put themselves at a distinct disadvantage, too, Blank says.

""You don't want to compete with someone who has an AI at their shoulder, because they're acting like they have a team of 20 people coaching them,"" says Blank. In addition to testing the hypothesis of a business idea, after all, AI assistants can help overwhelmed founders handle aspects of their business' finances, administrative tasks and web design.

""If you don't want to use it as a tool,"" fine, Blank says. ""No one is going to stop you not wanting to succeed.""

US low-cost airline JetBlue and its fuel partners have marked an industry milestone with the first regular supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for commercial air travel in the Northeast region at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK).

Last summer, the airline announced its agreement with World Fuel Services (World Fuel), a company under the global energy provider, World Kinect corporation, for a minimum of one million gallons of neat SAF to be provided by Valero Marketing and Supply Company (Valero), a subsidiary of the Valero Energy Corporation.

The SAF supply is produced by Diamond Green Diesel LLC, a joint-venture subsidiary between a Valero affiliate and Darling Ingredients Inc. affiliate. It is one of the largest renewable energy producers in North America, and the second largest in the world.

Diamond Green produces the SAF fuel, then it's blended with traditional jet fuel by Valero to create blended SAF, which is then delivered by World Fuel via jet fuel distribution infrastructure at JFK so that JetBlue can use it to power its fleet.

The blended SAF is a drop-in product for existing aircraft and infrastructure and can lower greenhouse gas emission lifecycles by up to around 80% compared to regular jet fuel.

To maintain the consistent SAF supply, JetBlue's corporate partners help cover the cost of the cleaner jet fuel, and under the terms of its deal with the partner companies, an additional four million gallons of neat SAF is possible.

“As the international gateway to the US, JFK is leading by example through our work on safe SAF delivery to our regional airports and promoting sustainable air travel. We look forward to facilitating more SAF operations across our airport system,” said Port Authority chairman, Kevin O'Toole.

The airline already receives regular SAF deliveries in its operations at San Francisco Airport (SFO) and Los Angeles Airport (LAX), and with its expansion efforts, its total SAF procurement has doubled since 2020.

Ursula Hurley, chief financial officer of JetBlue, also commented: “JFK has been JetBlue's home for 25 years, and our operations here should set the standard we envision for our entire network… Incorporating SAF into our flights is an important lever in decarbonising the aviation industry and expanding its availability to our Northeast airports is a big step.”

Shares for High Point-based vTv Therapeutic soared more than 69% on Monday in early trading after the company announced that the FDA had lifted the clinical hold on its late-stage trial for cadisegliatin, a potential adjunctive oral drug for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.

The FDA placed a clinical hold on the trial in July 2024 due to a chromatographic signal in how the drug was absorbed and processed. No patient had been dosed in the trial at the time of the clinical hold, and past clinical studies did not reveal any clinically concerning safety issues. The clinical hold was lifted on March 14, after it was concluded that the chromatographic signal was an experimental artifact, according to the company, which was founded in 2015.

“We are pleased that the FDA has lifted the clinical hold on our cadisegliatin program and are eager to resume our Phase 3 trial,” says CEO Paul Sekhri. 

The drug is used as an adjunct therapy meant to maximize the effectiveness of insulin alone. Its aim is to help diabetics maintain blood sugar levels while avoiding incidents of low blood sugar levels, according to the company. The drug has been well-tolerated in more than 500 subjects to date, according to the company.

In a January 2025 presentation to investors, the company reported that 9.4 million people globally have type 1 diabetes and that if the drug were approved it would have the potential for gross sales in the $3 billion to $5 billion range annually.

In its 2023 annual report, the company reported it had 16 full-time employees, with nine of them working in North Carolina. Of its employees, seven worked full-time in research and development, and 10 had graduate degrees, including eight with doctorates.

Shares of vTv Therapeutics have traded between $12.12 and $30.99 in the past year, and closed Friday at $14.82. Around 1:30 p.m. Monday, shares were trading at $24.84, up $10.02 or 69.5%. It has a market capitalization of $64 million.

In February 2024, vTv Therapeutics announced a $51 investment in private placement financing that included institutional investor Samsara BioCapital and JDRF, now known as Breakthrough T1D.

The company has reported losses ranging from $20.3 million in 2023 to $13 million in 2021. It has never reported a profit.

Bruce Andrews and Connor Bernard from mid-market aviation and defence M&A specialists Alderman & Company, advises company owners to embrace the space race

With the world growing ever more interconnected on a daily basis, satellite internet has quickly emerged from being a niche technology into being a global communication, defence, and business mainstay.

As data multiplies and efforts are made to bridge the divide between the offline and online population, players like SpaceX's Starlink and Blue Origin's Project Kuiper have emerged as the primary players in the field.

But as the reliance on satellite-based connectivity grows, it is more and more clear that a single controlling force could stifle innovation, raise prices, and even threaten national security.

This article explores the situation now, highlights Starlink's controlling position and Blue Origin's status and argues for why robust competition needs to be maintained in order to safeguard the future of satellite internet.

In order for direct-to-consumer high speed/high quality internet to be deployed worldwide there are two significant challenges.

The first challenge is the design and manufacture of thousands of small affordable technically sophisticated satellites combined with ground-based sender/receiver routers (so-called “Dishy” by Starlink) to permit direct to consumer internet reception.

The second challenge is to deploy the thousands of satellites into their respective orbits to create the satellite constellation. Clearly, Starlink has had the advantage in deployment thanks to the incredible success of SpaceX and the Falcon series of rockets.

Starlink has quickly become a synonym for satellite internet innovation. The company's aggressive deployment plan has resulted in a constellation of over 7,000 satellites in low Earth orbit and expansion plans for worldwide internet access with 42,000 satellites.

This large network already has offered real-world service to rural and underserved areas, revolutionising access to high-speed internet where the traditional infrastructure is not present.

Starlink's success extends past consumer markets; its technology has attracted significant government interest. Especially noteworthy are the Department of Defense contracts valued at approximately $733 million.

These highlights not only refer to first to market advantage but also to iterative improvements that have positioned Starlink as the industry standard-bearer.

The company's commitment to bringing people closer together all over the world is also reflected in its continuing innovation and swift growth, keeping even the remotest part of the world connected.

While Starlink has been going at an enormous speed, Project Kuiper of Blue Origin has encountered a succession of setbacks that have kept it from deployable success.

Delays in securing reliable launch vehicles, including United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur and Blue Origin's own New Glenn rocket, have significantly pushed back its deployment schedule.

Additionally, the project has faced manufacturing and regulatory challenges, compressing the timeline to meet FCC requirements that mandate at least half of its planned 3,236-satellite constellation be deployed by mid-2026.

These logistical hurdles have further postponed Project Kuiper's ability to begin providing commercial service, creating a widening gap between it and Starlink.

While Blue Origin remains committed to the initiative, the disparity in execution underscores how difficult it is to compete with Starlink's first-mover advantage and aggressive rollout strategy.

Project Kuiper's plans to manufacture satellites were initially envisioned for the first half of 2024 at a rate of five satellites per day but start-up issues delayed rate production to the end of 2024. Beta trials with paying users are envisioned in 2025.

Delays are indicative of the historic-sized issues with satellite mass production, management of complex supply chains, and transition from development to operation on a large scale.

As opposed to Starlink, with its enormous real-world experience, Project Kuiper is just starting to demonstrate viability at commercial levels.

That delay in practical experience not only postpones Blue Origin's market entry but also weakens its position in a rapidly evolving industry.

Competing against an established leader like Starlink, which continuously refines its technology and expands its reach, makes catching up increasingly difficult.

A future where Starlink dominates satellite internet poses risks, as a single company controlling such critical infrastructure could dictate pricing, limit service availability, and slow innovation.

Additionally, governments and industries relying on satellite connectivity may become overly dependent on one provider, creating economic and security vulnerabilities.

There is, however, significant good news and major progress achieved by Project Kuiper in recent months. Project Kuiper's new satellite manufacturing facility in Kirkland, Washington has been completed and is successfully producing higher satellite volumes.

Project Kuiper is also near completion of a satellite support facility on site at Cape Canaveral.

This facility is designed to complete system integration, perform satellite maintenance, and store completed satellites in preparation for charging its launch vehicles.

Significantly, Project Kuiper has also secured 83 launch reservations from its own Blue Origin rockets, United Launch Alliance, Arianespace, and from SpaceX, its direct competitor.

Thus, Project Kuiper is on the cusp of success having overcome the two key challenges of volume manufacturing and launch capacity.

Project Kuiper should be in the competitively challenging position of its goal of creating its own satellite constellation of 3,236 satellites in three orbital planes by the 2026/2027 timeframe.

With new entrants such as Amazon's Project Kuiper and other potential start-ups, a more dynamic and resilient market awaits.

These companies may well offer alternative technologies, new service models, and diverse approaches to global connectivity.

In a multi-firm market, consumers benefit from competitive pricing, improved service quality, and accelerated innovation.

A diversified industry also reduces reliance on a single provider, enhancing security and reliability.

While SpaceX's Starlink leads with services in over 100 countries, competition drives advancements and prevents monopolistic control over critical infrastructure.

The satellite internet industry is at a crossroads—though Starlink's success is significant, long-term sustainability depends on creating and maintaining a competitive market.

Having multiple competitors will lead to innovation and lower prices while also assuring that the network is more resistant to attacks from single points of failure.

With global demand for connectivity increasing relentlessly, it is not merely a question of economic efficiency to level the playing field for all contestants—it is a matter of strategy.

Opening ourselves to competition now is a gateway to a healthier, more dynamic, and safer satellite internet world tomorrow.

As specialists in the selling of middle market aerospace and defense companies, we believe that it is advisable for company owners to ensure they participate in those companies and technologies that support the growing space sector.

The sector is not only rapidly expanding but contains many areas in which to participate from launch vehicles to payloads to Space Infrastructure projects (e.g., debris detection and removal, ground support equipment, communication equipment, etc.).

We strongly encourage embracing the space sector for future growth and success.

Seed Golf is marking St Patrick's Day [March 17] with the launch of ‘The Craic', a limited-edition variant of its signature SD-01 golf ball that celebrates the Irish brand's heritage.

Embellished with the image of a traditional Irish pint of stout, the ball headlines a full product range that also includes ‘Craic' ball markers, a divot repair tool, a cap, towel and umbrellas. Each item can be bought individually or as part of ‘The Craic Pack', priced at £75 on Seed's online store.

‘Craic' is an Irish slang term for a fun, lively time spent in good company – the essence of Seed's golfing philosophy. The brand was founded in Ireland, and the country remains Seed's home as it expands to all corners of the globe.

Known as ‘The Pro One', the SD-01 is Seed's first and best-selling ball, launching alongside the company in 2017. Now in its third iteration, the SD-01 is a three-piece Tour construction ball with an ultra-thin urethane cover and can fly up to 306 yards.

Dean Klatt, founder and CEO of Seed Golf, said: “We wanted the Craic range to be a celebration of not only St. Patrick's Day but Ireland itself – the place that will always be Seed's home even as we expand operations to more countries than ever before.

“As well as the SD-01, which is our flagship ball for a good reason, we've given nearly all of our non-ball products the Craic treatment – so even if all your Craic balls eventually end up in a lake somewhere you can have something from the range in your golf bag for a long time.”

All of Seed's balls can be purchased in individual boxes or via an online subscription-based service.

At the start of 2025, Seed announced a major ramp-up of global operations, including new distribution channels in the United States and Australia.

SolasCure Enrols First Patient in a Next Phase II Clinical Trial to Advance Aurase Wound Gel

Phase II clinical trial to determine the efficacy of Aurase Wound Gel at a higher concentration of the active enzyme Tarumase in venous leg ulcers

CAMBRIDGE, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SOLASCURE Ltd (SolasCure), a biotechnology company developing a novel treatment to transform chronic wound healing, today announced the initiation of a new Phase II clinical trial, CLEANVLU2. The enrolment of the trial's first patient marks a new clinical milestone in the development of its investigational product, Aurase Wound Gel, for the treatment of chronic wounds.


Aurase Wound Gel is a hydrogel releasing Tarumase, a recombinant enzyme originally cloned from medical maggots that selectively targets fibrin, collagen and elastin in wounds to promote healing through debridement and wound bed preparation. CLEANVLU2 adds further insight to the successful Phase IIa clinical study, CLEANVLU 1, which established proof-of-concept, a strong safety profile and pain-free application. The new randomised controlled trial will explore the efficacy of Tarumase at higher concentration, in patients with venous leg ulcers.




Chronic wounds affect around 100 million people globally, representing a significant healthcare challenge with limited safe, pain-free, and effective treatments. Clinical data suggest that, after 6 weeks of the current standard of care treatment, overall wound closure is achieved in as little as 41% of chronic or hard-to-heal wounds 2. This trial will generate key efficacy data to further demonstrate Aurase Wound Gel's potential as the first treatment to address all aspects of wound bed preparation including debridement, informing investors and potential strategic partners.




The trial is being run in association with South Leicestershire Medical Group, UK, as part of its community service. Once the CLEANVLU2 study is completed, a further Phase II study is planned over a longer period, with stratification for factors that may affect debridement and wound healing, before moving into confirmatory clinical Phase III trials for regulatory approval.




Andy Weymann MD, MBA, Chairman of the Board, SolasCure said: “This trial is pivotal for fully demonstrating proof-of-concept of efficacy for Aurase Wound Gel with a stronger concentration of the enzyme Tarumase. This will help us to establish that the product can achieve complete debridement in 6-9 applications aligned with standard of care and have a positive influence on the rate of healing. This is what the market has been waiting for and brings Aurase Wound Gel a step closer to providing relief to those suffering from chronic wounds worldwide.”

The inside of Odds & Ends Again in Arden Hills is like a trip back in time, with vintage toys, phonographs and classic art around every turn.    The thrift shop opened last month, after spending a dozen years down the street in Shoreview.    All was well for owner Brett Foss, until he received a letter from the city. Foss was told his shop had 14 days to leave its Lexington Avenue location.    Odds & Ends Again was in an area where thrift shops are not allowed, something Foss said he had no idea about.

""They were reaching out and saying 'hey, that's now allowed in this zoning,' even though we have Goodwill across the street in the same zoning,"" said Foss.

Last week, Foss went before Arden Hills City Council to make the case for his business.

""The business owner should have known,"" Arden Hill's Mayor David Grant said during the meeting. 

Grant said Foss was told about the city's zoning districts while previously inquiring about a different property in the city last year.

""It's a situation that was created by the owner of Odds & Ends Again,"" said Grant.

Foss could apply for a zoning change, but said it is too costly.

""I'm not wanting to give up on anything,"" said Foss.

In the meantime, hundreds have signed an in-store petition asking council to reconsider. That is just a fraction of the support, which is now in the thousands, even coming from outside Minnesota, Foss said.

""I never could have dreamt this could have come out of it,"" said Voss. ""We're just trying to stay in business and be a local employer and give back to the community.""

Grant said the council will decide on the issue during an April 14th work session.

Foremost Golf, the UK's largest retail and marketing services group, has announced 250 users of its innovative Point of Sale (POS) software system, after its main launch last year.

Members recognise the immediate financial benefits of Foremost POS, despite the huge value the premium system brings, the new till system costs just £40 per month. 

Foremost POS is designed to provide accurate data and seamless integration with Foremost systems and services, and more than 250 members now benefit from these advanced features, saving time with product input, utilising accurate reports and streamlining business processes for golf retailers across the country.

“The transition was seamless. A lot of people were wary of changing things up, but the entire data transition to Foremost POS was completed within 15 minutes, a brand new till system that contained all my product details”, commented Martyn Hamer of Davyhulme Golf Club.

The new Foremost POS system integrates seamlessly with other key Foremost services such as the Foremost group's digital and integrated retail marketing system, EMP (Elite Marketing Programme) and the Central Invoicing & Payment system; which will deliver unparalleled benefits to Central and EMP premium members.

“Foremost POS gives me more confidence than any previous till system” added Rudy Stables of Hanging Heaton Golf Club. “Due to the Central Payment integration, the till system is 100% accurate and we have complete faith in the reliability of our stock levels.”

“We're thrilled with the response from the membership after rolling out Foremost POS, it has been nothing short of phenomenal”, commented Andy Martin, Managing Director at Foremost Golf “Foremost POS makes it so much easier to run a golf retail business, with two key benefits, saving time, and providing accurate data for our Business Development Consultants. Our support team is then fully informed and can show our members exactly where they can improve their business and margins.”

The Foremost POS system enables the Foremost BDC team to provide enhanced reporting capabilities and robust data analysis. The integrity of data has been a primary focus of this investment, as golf professionals and club managers relish efficient software systems and the ability to make more informed business decisions. Forecasts indicate consistent growth for Foremost POS sign-ups and continue to predict a minimum of 300 users by the end of 2025.

Canadian tariffs push costs up while Trump's tariffs push demand down — Desjardins

Expect to pay more for everything from new cars to your weekly grocery shop as the tariff war between Canada and the United States squeezes some businesses at both ends, economists warn.

So far U.S. President Donald Trump has put tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and threatened more to come on April 2. In retaliation, Canada has slapped duties on about $60 billion worth of U.S. goods and threatened them on another $100 billion.

Trump's tariffs will have the biggest impact on the economy, said Florence Jean-Jacobs, principal economist at Desjardins Group, but there will also be negative repercussions from Canada's counter tariffs and a weaker Canadian dollar for businesses who import materials from the United States.

“Some industries are caught between a rock and a hard place, risking a drop in U.S. demand for their products and an increase in their supply costs if substitutes are not easily found,” she wrote in her report.

The hardest hit sectors will be food manufacturing, machinery, plastics, chemical, automobiles, aerospace, wholesale trade and livestock and crop production.

Take, for example, a food manufacturer in Canada who exports to the United States. They would have to pay more to import grains, fruits and other raw materials from the U.S. to make their product because of Canadian tariffs, only to see sales fall south of the border because U.S. tariffs make them more expensive.

Even sectors that are considered resilient to Trump's direct tariffs such as construction, retail and food services will face higher costs because of Canada's retaliatory duties and a weak Canadian dollar.

Canada's construction industry will pay more for products it buys from the U.S. that range from heating and air conditioning equipment to furniture and cabinets to electrical and plumbing fixtures.

Auto wholesalers and dealers will pay more for cars imported from the U.S. as will retailers of clothing, food and beverages, pharmaceuticals and medical suppliers, said the Desjardins report.

“We can therefore expect consumers to pay higher prices for cars and parts imported from the United States and for food purchases that are hard to replace with Canadian or overseas products at equivalent cost,” said Jean-Jacobs.

The low loonie could also raise the price of gas, especially in eastern Canada where refineries are not set up to handle Western Canada's heavy oil and rely on imports from the United States.

The squeeze at both ends could lead to liquidity challenges for some companies, said the economist.

“They will have to choose between reducing their profits or increasing their selling prices, which will weaken their power to retain and attract customers already burned by the record-high inflation that followed the pandemic.”

The challenge will be especially difficult for low-margin businesses.

“Car dealerships and grocery stores, in particular, have some of the lowest margins among non-financial industries in Canada. Since Canada's counter-tariffs particularly target food and automobiles, these businesses could face significant challenges,” she said.

Jean-Jacobs said government support in reducing Canada's internal trade barriers, increasing productivity and exploring alternative markets will all help, “but companies will need to be proactive and invest to build their resilience against what's shaping up to be four years of uncertainty and volatility.”

How much do Trump's 25 per-cent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports matter to Canada? These sectors are highly dependent on the U.S. market, but in the big picture make up only 6 per cent of Canada's total merchandise exports.

The regional impact, however, is significant, in particular to Ontario and Quebec, said TD Economics' Maria Solovieva. Ontario produces most of the steel exports to the U.S. and Quebec the aluminum.

Quebec isn't just the biggest aluminum producer in Canada, it's the biggest on the continent and ranks fourth in the world behind China, India, and Russia.

				New Products 

Golfstream, a leading player in the UK electric and push trolley market, is celebrating its 18th year in business with a comprehensive brand refresh.

The stylish rebrand introduces a refined product lineup under the banner of the new GX Series, along with performance and design enhancements and an upgraded digital presence to better serve consumers and retailers alike.

INTRODUCING THE GX SERIESAs part of the brand transformation, Golfstream's electric trolley range will now be relaunched under the GX Series, offering a clearer and more intuitive product differentiation.

Golfstream's well-established Blue, Vision, and Vision Brake electric trolley models will now be known as the GX1, GX3, and GX5, respectively. Each model has been upgraded with enhanced design and performance features, ensuring a superior golfing experience.

Golfstream's commitment to user-friendly innovation continues across all GX Series models. All trolleys feature Golfstream's signature effortless one-touch folding mechanism, making setup and storage quick and convenient. Their lightweight, compact design ensures they can be transported easily, folding down to be among the most space-efficient electric trolleys on the market.

Each model secures the bag using side arms rather than the traditional central spine, significantly reducing any ‘bag wobble' on uneven terrain. Additionally, all three trolleys come with a non-clogging front wheel and detachable main wheels, simplifying cleaning and maintenance.

A liquidation plan at Canada's oldest company could begin at all of its locations as soon as Tuesday and last for up to 12 weeks, but Hudson's Bay is still holding out hope that it will find a lifeline.

Lawyers for the beleaguered retailer said in an Ontario court Monday morning that if approved by the judge, the liquidation would span 80 stores as well as three Saks Fifth Avenue stores and 13 Saks Off 5th locations in Canada that it owns through a licensing agreement.

The process Hudson's Bay is proposing would allow the retailer to remove some stores from the liquidation, should it find sufficient financing during the 10 to 12 weeks when lawyer Ashley Taylor expects the company to offload its inventory.

""A quick start will maximize the value of the business ... and preserve whatever chance there is of a restructuring,"" Taylor told Ontario Superior Court Judge Peter Osborne in a hearing at a Toronto courtroom Monday.

Hudson's Bay plans to liquidate business, close all stores

The hearing attracted so many lawyers, media and other observers that an overflow room had to be opened to facilitate spectators there to learn what will come of the retailer dating back to 1670, when the country was involved with the fur trade.

The hearing was meant to advance a creditor protection case Hudson's Bay launched March 7, when it admitted it was struggling with financial difficulties amid subdued consumer spending, Canada-U.S. trade tensions and post-pandemic drops in downtown store traffic.

It said the situation has become so bad that it deferred some payments to landlords, service providers and vendors and was days away from not being able to meet payroll obligations.

As it struggled, a landlord ""unlawfully locked"" Hudson's Bay out of a store located in Sydney, N.S., and a team of bailiffs attempted to seize merchandise from a location it runs in Toronto, Ont., mall Sherway Gardens, said Jennifer Bewley, the chief financial officer for Hudson's Bay's parent company, in a court filing.

When the company filed for creditor protection, Hudson's Bay lawyer Taylor said the retailer's plan was to restructure by liquidating half its stores and monetizing some of the leases it tends to hold in prime, high-traffic spaces.

That plan was to be carried out under debtor-in-possession financing, which lenders make available to troubled companies in order to help them restructure.

In the run-up to the March 7 court hearing, Taylor said the company had two lenders interested in supplying that funding. But three hours before, the financing from its chosen suitor ""fell apart"" and the retailer ""scrambled"" to get an alternative together.

That alternative came in the form of $16 million in funding commitments from U.S.-based investment management firm Restore Capital and other lenders, expanded to $23 million soon after.

Despite the boost, the commitments weren't enough to satisfy all of Hudson's Bay's needs, forcing the company to ""double"" its efforts to find more cash, Taylor said.

It's since reached out to at least 19 potential lenders and major landlords who could offer rent concessions.

""To date, the company's efforts have failed,"" Taylor said in court Monday as he described why the company needed to pursue liquidation.

The liquidation Hudson's Bay is seeking will span the company's entire footprint, with Ontario taking the bulk of the hit because it's where the company has 32 locations and more than half of its employees work. B.C. hosts 16 locations; Alberta and Quebec each have 13; and Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have two per province.

Saks Fifth Avenue's Canadian sites are split between Ontario and Alberta and Saks Off 5th has stores in Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Quebec and Manitoba.

Liquidating its entire business would put more than 9,000 jobs at risk.

Elizabeth Pillon, another lawyer who appeared on Hudson's Bay's behalf, said the company has about $315 million in inventory on its balance sheet right now and the proposed liquidation will extend to its e-commerce business, which will continue until the company's Scarborough, Ont., distribution centre empties.

The company plans to stop accepting gift cards after April 6 and has already paused its loyalty program, with more than 8.2 million Canadian customers holding about $58.5 million in unused points.

Hudson's Bay is also seeking permission to launch a process to find a buyer for some or all of its properties or the business.

The process would allow potential buyers to make a bid for some of the company's leases or just intellectual property, like Hudson's Bay's branding or rights to its famed stripe trademarks.

The company will also keep seeking financing. But some experts say finding a backer will be no easy feat for a business that has struggled with even ""simple"" matters like keeping escalators working.

""It is a major challenge and no doubt with some large strings attached,"" said Lanita Layton, a luxury and retail consultant and a former Holt Renfrew vice-president, in an email.

""Depending on who, if anyone does bring the financing, I don't foresee HBC continuing in the same format.""

She says Hudson's Bay's most logical path forward will be shrinking the company to a ""manageable size"" by operating a smaller number of stores more ""conducive to today's customer desires,"" which include a unique product mix, experiential opportunities, exciting visuals and great customer service.

""This marks the end of a nearly 400-year-old institution which is going to have significant impacts in reshaping the Canadian retail landscape, with major consequences for employees, customers, as well as broader retailers operating in Canada,"" said Jenna Jacobson, director of the Retail Leadership Institute at Toronto Metropolitan University.

This could be a real challenge for malls as large department stores act as the anchors in a lot of malls and also act as the driver to bring in consumers, she said.

""Filling that space is very challenging, because what retailer is able to take over that amount of space.""

Hudson's Bay Company, in its original form, was founded by fur traders and owned a vast tract of northern Canada around Hudson Bay where it operated a far-flung chain of trading posts.

Dating back to 1670, it has been deeply entrenched in Canadian history, but has been led by Americans for several decades now.

The architect behind most of the Bay's modern history is Richard Baker, an American real estate titan whose National Realty and Development Corp. Equity Partners bought the company in 2008 from the widow of late South Carolina businessman Jerry Zucker for $1.1 billion.

Baker took it public in 2012, only to reverse course through a takeover bid that had to be sweetened twice before shareholders accepted it in early 2020, ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

      America's biggest retailers are deploying every weapon they have to navigate President Trump's fast-escalating trade war, from leaning on suppliers for discounts to finding alternate product sources. In some cases, that includes price increases for consumers.


     
      Much of the action so far has focused on goods from China, which the Trump administration hit with a 10% tariff in February and another 10% in March. Some suppliers say Walmart, Home Depot and other retailers are pushing a variation of the same demand: Make a price concession or shift production out of China. Otherwise, the suppliers risk losing some business.


     
      The sometimes-tense deliberations among retailers and suppliers show how Trump's trade agenda is already rippling through global supply chains, with billions of dollars of consumer spending at stake.


     
      “Companies are completely under the gun and panicking,"" said Joe Jurken, founder of the ABC Group in Milwaukee, which helps U.S. businesses manage supply chains in Asia. He has received a flood of inquiries from manufacturers facing pressure from retailers to move production out of China, he said.


     
      Some of the requests have raised the ire of Chinese officials. Authorities in China summoned Walmart for a meeting in recent days after some suppliers complained the largest U.S. retailer by annual revenue was pressuring them to cut prices and absorb the tariff cost.


     
      Walmart said it was in discussions with suppliers to help consumers save money and that it would continue to work closely with them “to find the best way forward during these uncertain times.""


     
      Some pricing negotiations are hitting an impasse because many of these manufacturers are often already operating on razor-thin margins, according to suppliers. And retailers don't want to raise prices for shoppers so they can continue to compete for market share.


     
      William Liu, sales director for Rongli Garments, a Chinese manufacturer that makes seamless apparel, said that when the 10% tariff hit in February, his company agreed to lower prices by 5% for Walmart, though it cut into the garment maker's profit margins. After Trump imposed the additional 10% tariff, Walmart asked his company to raise the discount to 10%. Liu's company couldn't afford to absorb the cost and, as a result, Walmart is seeking new suppliers outside China, Liu said.


     
      Target, too, is talking to suppliers about how to share any additional costs, said Rick Gomez, chief commercial officer for the company. “Right now, a lot of those negotiations are going on.""


     
      Some of the haggling has prompted more sourcing from outside of China. After the first 10% tariff on Chinese goods in February, Home Depot asked one of its U.S. suppliers of lighting and home decor to absorb the cost, according to an executive at the supplier. The supplier agreed to a two-month, 10% discount, part of which would be covered by its Chinese manufacturer.


     
      After the second 10% tariff in March, the supplier declined another request from Home Depot to lower prices again. Instead, the supplier is moving production to Southeast Asia so it can eventually charge the home-improvement retailer the original price, the executive said.


     
      A Home Depot spokeswoman said the company has been diversifying its sourcing for more than a decade. “We do this partnering with our vendors typically over several years,"" she said.


     
      The tariff planning is especially complicated because companies have little sense of which tariff threats will materialize and where new ones could emerge, retailers and suppliers say. Bouqs Co., an online flower company, learned that lesson soon after Trump took office and threatened a 25% tariff against goods imported from Colombia because of the country's initial refusal to accept repatriation flights from the U.S.


     
      That sent Bouqs executives into an emergency weekend meeting, during which they came up with a plan for Bouqs and its partners to share costs if tariffs emerge, Chief Executive Kim Tobman said. Farms in Colombia provide much of the cut flowers sold in the U.S. Bouqs sells goods directly to shoppers as well as inside Amazon.com's Whole Foods.


     
      “We had been thinking China,"" Tobman said. “There was no talk in our world about Colombia.""


     
      Trump reversed course a few days later after Colombia accepted the repatriation flights. “It was a real shocker and stress for our team"" and came just ahead of Valentine's Day, one of the industry's biggest sales days, she said.


     
      Now as the president threatens additional tariffs on a range of other trading partners, companies are worried about investing resources into moving production, only to potentially face duties on goods from those locations.


     
      “Choosing any other country other than the U.S. and thinking it's a safe haven is risky,"" said Kimberly Kirkendall, president of International Resource Development, an international supply-chain consulting firm that works with U.S. suppliers. “If your business is big enough and you've got the financial wherewithal to have multiple manufacturing sites, then that's the best strategy.""


     
      In some cases, retailers and manufacturers have decided it is worth it to keep production in China to maintain quality. Costco, the warehouse chain, plans to continue selling patio furniture made in China—even at an elevated price—because it is higher quality than versions made in other countries, Costco executives said. Costco and its supplier will absorb some of the cost increase and pass some on to shoppers, they said.


     
      Prices on all goods affected by tariffs won't go up equally. Retailers create their tariff pricing strategies with the full assortment of goods consumers usually buy in mind. They might raise the price of clothing that shoppers are willing to pay more for, while keeping the price steady on another item shoppers are likely to buy frequently like bananas or paper towels.


     
      Merchants have to think through “pricing architecture,"" said Gomez, the Target executive. Target, for example, wants to continue selling some Christmas ornaments at $3, rather than raising the price.


     
      “That means we have to think about margin elsewhere. So maybe we will take pricing up a little bit on stockings,"" he said. “It's really not as simple as just flowing through cost.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news","Indian Wells prize money: Men's champion earns more than women's winner","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/indian-wells-prize-money-why-the-womens-champion-gets-more-than-the-mens-winner","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 08:38:46 GMT","

The prize money for the Indian Wells tournament has been revealed, with the men's champion taking home more cash than their female rivals.

For the first time since 2009, the prize money at the 2025 BNP Paribas Open is not being distributed equally between the ATP and WTA Tours, with a 2.13% difference between the two.

The total combined prize money was $19,387,080, with the ATP Tour receiving $9,693,540 and the WTA Tour receiving $9,489,532. This represented a rise of 6.63% from 2024.

But the WTA Tour has confirmed that they have opted to give their champion less money than the ATP Tour Masters 1000 winner at the same venue.

So while men's champion Jack Draper collected $1,201,125 for his breakthrough maiden ATP Masters 1000 title, women's champion Mirra Andreeva received $1,127,500.

The difference in cash distribution is also reflected across the draw, with losing finalists in the men's tournament getting $638,750 and the women's runner-up earning $599,625.

Losing semi-finals in the men's event get $354,850 in prize money, which is a little more than the $333,125 female last four players collect.

The WTA Tour opted to give more money to players who go out in the earlier rounds of the competition, with players knocked out in the first round getting $30,801 and second round losers collecting $43,050. Those figures are more than the male players who were knocked out early in the California desert.

This variable prize money distribution will not be reflected at the Miami Open that gets underway imminently, with prize money in the second part of the ‘Sunshine Double' equal for the ATP Tour and WTA Tour events:

Miami ranking points and prize money

First round: 10 points | $23,760
Second round: 35 points | $35,260
Third round: 65 points | $60,400
Round of 16: 120 points | $103,225
Quarterfinals: 215 points | $189,075
Semifinals: 390 points | $332,160
Finalist: 650 points | $597,890
Champion: 1000 points | $1,124,380

With the WTA Tour generating a lot less revenue than the ATP Tour in broadcast revenue, it is tough for many tournaments to pay equal prize money when they are hosting men's and women's events.

All four Grand Slam tournaments pay men and women the same money, even though one plays best-of-five-set matches and the other only competes over three sets.

It means that male players need to stay on court for longer to earn the same amount of money, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal offering his comments on the equal pay debate last year.

“I don't want to be hypocritical and say things that are easy to say and that I don't feel. What do you want me to say? For me, the investment for women should be the same as for men,” said Nadal.

“The opportunities, the same. The salaries, the same? No, for what? It's not unfair, what's unfair is that there isn't equal opportunity.

“I have a mother and a sister. If you tell me that men and women deserve the same opportunities, I'm a feminist. This term is taken to the extreme. If we're talking about logical and normal things in this conversation, of course I want equality.

“For me, equality isn't about giving away gifts, but if Serena Williams earns more than me, I want her to earn more than me. I want equality, I want women to earn more than men if they generate more than men.

“What bothers me is when people tell me that income and earnings should be equal. In tennis, for some reason, the payouts are almost equal in most events because at the time there was an opportunity for women's tennis to be seen.

“Women's tennis is very popular around the world. I don't want to get into a fight about this, the problem for me is the discussion.”

Featured:

SETERMOEN, Norway — The Norwegian Army has dropped tennis balls on tanks to test new attack strategies for drones, drawing on tactics seen on the battlefields of Ukraine.

Officials staged the evaluation as part of NATO exercise Joint Viking 2025, held in Northern Norway earlier this month. The idea was to test intelligence and surveillance tactics involving the deployment of different types of unmanned aerial vehicles.

Among them were first-person-view drones, or FPVs, used by Ukrainian and Russian forces to attack enemy positions or equipment. Skilled operators have been able to steer the remote-controlled drones into the open hatches of tanks and armored vehicles, blowing up their deadly charge inside.

In the context of the exercise, the drones carried tennis balls to simulate munitions hitting Norwegian armored vehicles, according to Maj. Tor Sellevold, who works for Combat Lab, the Norwegian Army's land warfare centre testing unmanned technologies.

“To simulate attacks on participating forces, tennis balls were dropped and FPVs were flown in dive attack patterns to simulate modern-day drone threats — the purpose was to provide insights to the participants of their own aerial signature, experience the threat from top-attack drones, and evaluate their standard operating procedures,” he told Defense News in an email.

Over 30 tennis balls were dropped during the ten sorties the FPVs carried out, he added. This represented the first time that the Norwegian Army conducted such testing with attack drones at that scale.

In Ukraine, cheap drones have proven increasingly capable of striking larger Russian platforms, such as combat helicopters, as a result of their fast-paced development, which now allows them to fly faster and further than at the start of the conflict.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense recently announced the creation of the Drone Line project, which seeks to establish a 15 kilometer unmanned “kill zone” along the front lines. The plan entails the deployment of a mix of surveillance and strike drones.

The Norwegian military has been paying close attention to all the developments ongoing in Ukraine regarding drone warfare.

As part of its operations, the Army's military intelligence battalion plans to operate drones from further back from the battle space, an officer within the unit, who wished not to be named, told Defense News.

“Our unit [Norwegian Army's military intelligence battalion] will not be operating them close to the frontlines, we will do so from a larger distance back with longer-ranges ones,” the officer said in an interview during Joint Viking.

Norway plans to acquire new drones that will be more suitable to operate in Arctic conditions, with “very long-range” cameras, the officer added.

During the exercise, another drone that the unit deployed to conduct surveillance missions was the U.S.-made Puma, manufactured by AeroVironment.

World number two Iga Swiatek has made the headlines again after experts claimed that the tennis star 'doesn't know real life' as she lost her temper during the Indian Wells semi-final.

The Pole came under fire after she smashed a ball at a ball kid following her devastating loss to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva 7-6 1-6 6-3, who reached the tournament's final for the first time.

Swiatek appeared to smash the ball back into the ground towards the ball kid after the tennis star was thrown it as she was on serve.

The ball kid was able to evade the ball as it bounced into the crowd, followed by a hostile reaction from those in attendance, who booed the Polish player.

However, Eurosport expert Tomasz Wolfke has now claimed, via SuperExpress, that her recent struggles may be related to her lifestyle off the court.

'She doesn't know real life,' he said. 'I don't remember anyone seeing her at a disco, all dressed up, having fun with friends.

'Maybe it's not a convent life, not that much, but it's definitely rare. Tennis will be a profession for her for a dozen or so years, but she's probably good at it - he admitted.' 

His comments came after the WTA rankings were updated on Monday, with Swiatek still number two but significantly lower than Aryna Sabalenka, who has 9,606 points.

The Polish star has endured a challenging time on the court and lost all five of her semi-final appearances since triumphing in the French Open in June 2024.

Tennis legend Boris Becker has also commented on Swiatek's behaviour during the disappointing semi-final.

'Iga got little angry…' he wrote on X (formerly Twitter).

Andreeva, meanwhile, achieved the end of her path to Indian Wells triumph as the 17-year-old player defeated world number one Aryna Sabalenka.

The Siberia-born star fought back for a 2-6 6-4 6-3 victory in her second successive title after clinching a trophy in Dubai at the end of February.

She became the youngest champion in WTA history at this level and has risen to sixth place in the world rankings.

In Mallorca, 15-year-old Indian tennis prodigy works at Nadal's academy, far from the apathy of Indian tennis administration.

A few weeks back, pictures emerged of Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi meeting Rafael Nadal while training at his academy in Mallorca. It was also reported that the Spanish superstar congratulated the 15-year-old on her remarkable run at last month's WTA event at Mumbai. This was a much-needed ray of hope for fans during a particularly lean run for Indian tennis.

Maaya, just 15, became the first player born in 2009 to reach the semifinal of a WTA event at the Mumbai 125k. A few weeks later, she packed her bags to move to the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, where she will spend at least one year. Having already made her first strides on the tour at such a young age, and securing a place in a prestigious international academy where she can hone her talent and build a European base to play tournaments, the future looks bright for a real talent to emerge from the country.

But the real hard yards are what lies ahead. Living a life on the road away from her father and committing to tennis full-time at such a young age comes with its own challenges. If she is to continue training and playing abroad, with little to no administrative support, the financial costs will rise to levels that will be hard for her family to maintain. The grind of transitioning to the tour has eaten up many promising juniors in the past. And doing it where she is now will be no cakewalk; Spanish academies – having produced generations of tennis superstars – are famed for unique and creative, but also tough, training regimens.

“It's a lot of tactical work,” Maaya tells The Indian Express from Mallorca. “After a certain level of tennis, I think that's what good coaching is, learning the right tactics and using them in your natural game. It's a great environment here, I'm learning to be a professional.”

At 15, Maaya seems to be breaking the mould for a prodigal Indian athlete.

Her baseline play and movement are solid and so is her court craft – top-level women's tennis is becoming less about the variety of the arsenal and more about finding the opportune moment to use weapons wisely. But her consistent temperament is eye-catching; staying cool under pressure has long been the Achilles' heel of Indian sporting prodigies.

Globe-trotting does not seem to bother her; she does not seem to mind spending her formative teenage years in a foreign country among new people in an alien culture. When asked what does, she begins to show her young age for the first time.

“The toughest thing is that I miss my father,” she says. “I'm very close to both of my parents. I live with my mom, we have rented an apartment here, but I travel around and I play, so it's not possible for my dad to come everywhere. Staying away from him for a very long time is tough.”

Based out of Coimbatore, Maaya picked up a racquet as an after-school activity at the age of 8. By 11, she and her parents knew the goal was to turn professional. The immediate goal also became to send her abroad.

For players like Maaya, an early commitment to a career in tennis can be daunting. The financial challenges can be extreme in a sport where funding is so often unglamorous. Lakhs of rupees can be spent scouring the globe to play tournaments where a tame first-round exit is a possibility. But that exposure is crucial for the development of a player at Maaya's stage of their career.

And in India, securing that funding takes place in an entirely personal capacity; administrative apathy is Indian tennis's well-publicised legacy. From the Amritraj brothers and Ramesh Krishnan in the 1970s and 80s, to Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi in the 90s, to Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna this century; each of Indian tennis's success stories stem from stray sponsors and familial dedication; existing outside the system, not within it.

And Maaya's case is no different. Her parents – her father works at an MNC and is the sole breadwinner of the family – have solely supported her dream in her initial years. After she showed promise on the junior tour, sponsorships came in, the first of which was from an anonymous benefactor.

“I didn't even know their name yet. But they are sponsoring us through the trust that Maaya's coach, Manoj Kumar, set up,” Maaya's mother, Revathi, says. “It started when it was only us – when we started out we had to sell some properties and burn our savings – but slowly after that, it (Maaya's support and funding) has become quite professional.” The 15-year-old is now sponsored by companies like TVS, LG, and American Steels.

Even aside from just paying for coaching, nutritionists, and travel, India does not even contain a high-quality training facility. The National Tennis Center (NTC) was opened by the All India Tennis Association (AITA) in 2020 with the idea of creating a talent pipeline and harnessing the talent they produced – a de-facto high-performance center. Not only were those heady dreams never achieved, amid an ongoing court case over the validity of the federation's latest election results due to an alleged breach of the National Sports Code, the NTC also shut down earlier this year.

With the system set up for young players in India to fail, the moment they show promise, they attempt to secure a ticket to a foreign academy. India's most promising junior men's player, 17-year-old Manas Dhamne, is currently training at the Piatti Center in Rome – the same academy that gave Jannik Sinner, the current World No. 1, his start.

A lack of domestic administrative support has not deterred Maaya and her family's dedication towards making her a top tennis pro. “So far, we have never missed anything,” Revathi says.

Maaya is almost forceful in her positivity about the decision to become a tennis player. “I want to do this because this is what I love and this is what I'm good at. I love to compete. That is why I am pursuing a career in tennis. And I know I'm lucky, because my parents respected that decision. Not everyone does,” the 15-year-old says.

For months, domestic Indian tennis circles had been buzzing about Maaya's talent before the semifinal run in Mumbai last month. She entered what was only her fifth professional tournament with a qualifying wildcard and won five matches in a row. It was her first breakthrough in the rankings, and she landed at the World No. 646 spot, making it a top 20 highest-ranking for a debutante (that list includes Monica Seles and the Williams sisters.)

Impressive as her achievements are, Maaya's early success is magnified because Indian tennis has had very little hope of late. Sumit Nagal is the only player, man or woman, to be a singles presence at the Grand Slams. More and more players, at a younger age, are veering towards doubles in search of playing opportunities and success.

That expectations are already being harboured of Maaya, does not seem to add to the pressure.

“To have so much crowd support and to have so many people asking about you can only be a good thing,” Maaya says. She is currently preparing to play a few junior ITF tournaments before the French Open juniors in May.



Crowd support is not the best part of playing in India though. It is getting to see her father and having a hit with him on court – a great way to settle a few arguments.

“He was always better than me, but now…”

CONWAY, Ark. – The Central Arkansas tennis team opened ASUN conference play with a tough weekend on the road, falling 6-1 to Stetson on Friday before narrowly dropping a 4-3 decision to FGCU on Sunday.

Against Stetson, the Sugar Bears fought hard but struggled to gain momentum. The lone point for UCA came from the Vimuktananda/Miyakwa and Kazama/Shigemasu in doubles play, securing a hard-fought victory. Despite the final score, several matches were tightly contested, showcasing UCA's resilience.

The Sugar Bears bounced back with a stronger performance against FGCU, pushing the Eagles to the wire in a 4-3 loss. UCA picked up key singles wins from Vimuktananda and Park, while the doubles pair of Vimuktananda/Miyakawa and Kazama/Shigemasu secured a victory to set the tone early. The match came down to the final singles showdown, but FGCU ultimately clinched the win.

UCA looks to regroup and build on this experience as they prepare for their matches this weekend at North Alabama and Lipscomb.

Old Dominion women's tennis fell to No. 24 Georgia Tech in its last road game of the weekend by a 4-0 score.

ATLANTA, Ga. – Old Dominion women's tennis fell to No. 24 Georgia Tech in its last road game of the weekend by a 4-0 score.

“Tough result today,"" Head Coach Dominic Manilla said. ""We lost some key points in the dubs that got us off to an early 0-1 deficit. In singles we were in the midst of a momentum surge that felt like we were going to turn the match our way but unfortunately they were able to secure the fourth point at number 1 singles where we have had so much success this season. Hats off to Georgia Tech, they played a heck of a match today. This weekend had its ups and downs, we were happy to do well in our SBC match play. I'm happy with where we are at this point in the season. Go monarchs.”

The Yellow Jackets began the morning with a doubles win from No. 2 Alejandra Cruz and Given Roach over Lidiia Rasskouskaia and Ulyana Romanova (6-2). Teammates No. 1 Kylie Bilchev and Scarlett Nicholson downed Monarchs Sofia Johnson and Victoria Matasova (6-2) to put Georgia Tech on the board first. No. 3 Marina Markina's and Kira Matushkina's match against Taly Licht and Meera Jesudason was suspended at 4-5.

No. 5 Licht continued to add onto Georgia Tech's lead with a win over Matasova (6-2, 6-2) to open the singles matches. No. 2 Cruz, who's ranked 113th in the nation, followed suit by downing Matushkina (6-1, 6-0), and No. 1 teammate, who places 94th in the nation, secured the Yellow Jacket's win as she defeated No. 10 Johnson (6-3, 6-3). Monarchs No.3 Rasskouskaia, No. 4 Romanova, and No. 6 Markina had their matches against respective opponents Kate Sharabura (6-3, 4-6, 1-1), Roach (1-6, 6-4), and Olivia Carneiro (7-5, 2-4) suspended.

 A busy 12 days in the south-western United States ended with Jack Draper claiming his maiden ATP Masters 1000 crown in Indian Wells, California, while #NextGenATP Joao Fonseca also picked up a trophy at an ATP Challenger Tour 175 event in neighbouring Arizona. 

 Draper has become a Top 10 player for the first time after his title run, while Fonseca has also hit a new career high. ATPTour.com looks at the movers of the week in the PIF ATP Rankings as of Monday, 17 March. 



 No. 60 Joao Fonseca, +20 (Career High) 
After tasting success on his Indian Wells debut by defeating Jacob Fearnley (before falling to eventual champion Draper in the second round), Fonseca racked up five more wins in the south-western United States to take the title at the Arizona Tennis Classic. The 18-year-old Brazilian dropped just one set to prevail from a stacked draw at the Challenger 175 event in Phoenix: He defeated Jan-Lennard Struff, Kei Nishikori and Alexander Bublik en route to his third Challenger crown, a triumph that has lifted him 20 spots to a career-high World No. 60. 

 No. 7 Jack Draper, +7 (Career High) 
Like Fonseca, Draper also dropped just one set throughout his title run at the BNP Paribas Open. The 23-year-old Briton defeated his fellow seeds Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Carlos Alcaraz and Holger Rune to claim the biggest title of his career. Draper's semi-final triumph against two-time defending champion Alcaraz secured his rise into the Top 10 for the first time, and he is now the new World No. 7 after seeing off Rune in the championship match.

 No. 18 Arthur Fils, +3 (Career High) 
The 20-year-old Fils pulled through a couple of three-setters (against Lorenzo Musetti and Marcos Giron, respectively) on the way to his maiden Masters 1000 quarter-final in Indian Wells. Although he fell to Daniil Medvedev in a deciding-set tie-break in the last eight, Fils has jumped three spots to a career-high World No. 18. The Frenchman will enter the Miami Open presented by Itau this week with no PIF ATP Rankings points to defend from the 2024 edition. 
 No. 34 Tallon Griekspoor, +9 
Dutchman Griekspoor was another first-time Masters 1000 quarter-finalist in Indian Wells, where he launched his campaign by overcoming Miomir Kecmanovic in three sets and then defeating Alexander Zverev for his first victory against a Top 5 opponent. The 28-year-old also downed Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard and Yosuke Watanuki in the California desert before falling to Rune, and he has climbed nine spots to World No. 34. 
 No. 64 Kei Nishikori, +12 
The former World No. 4 Nishikori continued his post-injury climb up the PIF ATP Rankings by notching four wins across Indian Wells and Phoenix. The Japanese star defeated Juame Munar in his first BNP Paribas Open appearance for four years before falling to Ugo Humbert, and then bounced back quickly to reach the semi-finals in Arizona. Nishikori has risen 12 spots to World No. 64, his highest position since May 2022. 
 Other Notable Top 100 Movers 
No. 5 Novak Djokovic, +2 
No. 12 Holger Rune, +1 
No. 24 Francisco Cerundolo, +2 
No. 41 Alexandre Muller, +3 (Joint Career High) 
No. 45 Marcos Giron, +3 
No. 51 Zizou Bergs, +2 (Career High) 
No. 54 Jakub Mensik, +3 
No. 70 Damir Dzumhur, +14

No. 100 Nishesh Basavareddy, +1 (Career High)

Match Recap: Men's Tennis | 3/16/2025 8:46:00 PM 

 Lipscomb

3/19/2025 | 3:00 PM

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (March 16, 2025) – The University of North Alabama men's tennis team won in dramatic fashion Sunday evening in Louisville, completing a 4-3 comeback victory against the Bellarmine Knights.

The second dual in Atlantic Sun Conference play saw North Alabama battling Bellarmine from start to finish. The Knights struck first early with the doubles point, then taking two of the opening three singles matches to gain a 3-1 team lead. The Lions received a key singles win from flight two, leading to UNA's fourth, fifth and sixth flights taking wins in straight sets to complete the road-dual rally.

North Alabama completes the weekend away from Florence at 2-0 in ASUN bouts, with UNA now 11-3 on the campaign. Bellarmine's record stands at 4-7 with a 0-2 conference record.

Five Lions secured victories en route to the win, led by sophomore Birtan Duran with a singles and doubles triumph. Duran and senior Nazar Fedoryshyn combined for a court two doubles victory, with the sophomore also providing the second singles win.

Sophomore Izan Orgiles battled back a set down for a crucial three-set singles win, with freshmen Satoru Nakajima and Samu Dominguez capturing straight-set triumphs to complete the come-from-behind victory.

Bellarmine gained the 1-0 team advantage with doubles wins on courts one and three. The Knights secured a flight three victory to start, but Duran and Fedoryshyn won 6-4 from court two to force the deciding point on court one. Bellarmine was able to see out the top-flight doubles, as Louis Fletcher and Eli Wood defeated Orgiles and sophomore Alberto Altur, 6-3.

Playing three singles matches at a time, the top three flights opened play with Knights able to gain the first win. Bellarmine's Jack Batchelor beat junior Lachlan Brain, 6-3, 6-4, but Orgiles answered back with a hard-fought, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 triumph from flight two over Matthew Nice.

Altur and the Knights' Vineet Rameesh also battled to three sets, but Rameesh gave Bellarmine the 3-1 team lead with a 6-7 (1-7), 6-4, 7-5 victory.

The bottom three flights opened with a Duran win, as the sophomore took a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Wood from court four. Nakajima tied the dual with a straight-sets bout against Bellarmine's Brent Reynolds, but the fifth-flight matchup needed tiebreaks in both sets. Nakajima secured both to take the battle, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-3).

Dominguez and the Knights' Diego Martinez decided the dual from court six, but a strong performance from the UNA freshman saw the Lions take the dual with a 6-3, 6-2 victory.

Men's Tennis | 3/16/2025 10:29:00 PM

WINSTON-SALEM, NC – Well. It took the No. 1 team in the nation to do it, but the North Carolina A&T men's tennis team is no longer undefeated.

The Aggies suffered their first loss of the season at the hands of the top-ranked men's tennis team in the International Tennis Association (ITA) poll, the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, 4-0, at the Wake Forest Tennis Center on Sunday.

The Aggies dropped to 11-1, while the Deacs improved to 24-0.

It was a clincher's match, where the match or doubles point ends once a team clinches enough points to determine the winner because the Deacs were playing the second match of a doubleheader after beating 32nd-ranked Florida State earlier in the day.

That became the case in doubles. Wake won at No. 3 doubles 6-3 behind the partnership of Dylan Chang and Harry Thursfield as they defeated sophomore Kaua Santos and junior Mathieu Dussaubat. Wake Forest clinched the doubles point when Ioannis Xilas and Franco Capalbo beat sophomore Lucas Coupo-Moison and freshman Jindrich Brill, 6-2, at No. 2 doubles.

Sophomore Said Akbarov and senior Ian Pedersen were in a competitive 5-5 match with Wake's No. 1 doubles team of DK Suresh Ekambaram and Martin Mazev when the match stopped because the Deacs had already clinched the doubles point.

Wake took a 2-0 lead once singles play started when Wake's Luca Pow won No. 2 singles by retirement, which usually indicates an injury or illness by the opponent, which in this case was Coupo-Moison. No reason for the retirement was stated. Wake increased its lead at No. 6 singles as Cornelius Shalmi defeated Dussaubat 6-1, 6-2.

Sunday's clincher came at No. 3 singles. Joaquin Guilleme defeated Santos 6-2, 6-3 to give the Deacs the necessary points to win the match. The other matches still playing when Guilleme clinched for Wake included Aggies senior Ian Pedersen at the No. 1 position.

Pedersen lost his first set to Xilas but led 5-3 in the second before the match ended. Akbarov also held a second-set lead at No. 4 singles. He lost the first set to Thursfield 6-4, before taking a 4-3 advantage in the second. Something similar brewed at No. 5 singles, where Brill lost the first set to Chang. He did not have the lead in the second set, but it was still close as he only trailed 4-3 in the second.

A&T recently added another ITA-ranked team to its schedule. The Aggies will face the Georgia Bulldogs at 5 p.m., Saturday, March 29 in Athens, Ga. The Bulldogs are currently ranked 30th in the nation. A&T's next match is Monday at 1 p.m., against Queens University of Charlotte at Howard Levine Tennis Center in Charlotte, NC.

Welcome back to the Monday Tennis Briefing, where The Athletic will explain the stories behind the stories from the past week on court.

This week, Indian Wells dominated the tennis world, with 2024 champions Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek suffering similar fates but contrasting futures. Elsewhere, there was a top-10 reshuffle on the ATP Tour, three American women lining up in the WTA Tour top five and some retirees getting a nice new tournament.

If you'd like to follow our fantastic tennis coverage, click here.

Alcaraz and Swiatek arrived in Indian Wells as heavy favorites. They lost in three sets in the semifinals and their conquerors, Jack Draper and Mirra Andreeva, went on to win the titles.

It would be easy to draw parallels, but other than coming up short on a court where they are generally masterful, Swiatek and Alcaraz are at very different spots in their quests to reclaim their top form and top ranking. That starts with their headspace. Swiatek swatted a ball towards her box in annoyance during her semifinal. She looked frustrated during recent defeats and against Andreeva, as when they met in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, she failed to convert numerous inroads on her opponent's serve into break points and games. Swiatek has routed all comers and lost tight matches to eventual champions for most of the year, but the level she expects from herself is even higher.

Alcaraz wasn't happy with his loss to Jack Draper either, but he was irritated with how he went into the match more than how he played it, despite an aberration of a first set. He dominated the second and looked ready to roll through the third, before umpire Mohamed Lahyani fluffed a double-bounce call against Draper on a key point. Draper appealed both the decision and the idea that the call had affected Alcaraz through video review. He was successful on both counts and the delay checked the set's momentum and let Draper gather himself.

Draper also offered to replay the point, but Alcaraz said he hadn't been distracted in a news conference after the loss. Neither Swiatek nor Madison Keys, who won just one game against Aryna Sabalenka in their semifinal, did news conferences after their exits.

Alcaraz and Swiatek's paths diverge most strikingly in what comes next. Alcaraz has big opportunities to pick up points over the next few months. He won't be defending a title until the French Open, after a right arm injury heavily disrupted his clay-court season last year. Swiatek has a lot of defending to do. Once she gets done in Miami, the queen of the red clay will defend WTA 1,000 titles in Madrid and Rome before she seeks a fourth consecutive French Open title.

Head to Luxembourg in October and tennis fans will find the Luxembourg Ladies Tennis Masters, an event that offers recently retired professionals the chance to play in a competitive event as opposed to an exhibition doubles mostly staged for trick shots and banter.

Swedish entrepreneur Marten Hedlund has launched the Legends Team Cup to perform a similar role on the men's tour, but it comes complete with a $12 million (£10.1m) prize pool and player draft of the 18 former tennis professionals involved. They include former Grand Slam champions Dominic Thiem and Juan Carlos Ferrero, and former top-five players including Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

The event will be played in eight different venues across the world, starting in Saint Barths in the Caribbean in June before arriving at New York's UBS Arena from July 16 to July 18. Last week, the event announced that the legendary Bjorn Borg would join as the event's “Grand Master of Tennis,” a role as open as it is bombastic.

Having stayed out of the tennis spotlight for some time, Borg, now 68, has ensured he will remain visible in the sport for a bit longer and players at last year's Luxembourg event, including Grand Slam champions and former world No. 1s Martina Hingis and Ana Ivanovic, told The Athletic how much they valued having an event that isn't just a hit and giggle. The Legends Cup will have a go at another tennis format, though: matches will be capped at 45 minutes.

Three American women in the WTA Tour top five. Not too shabby.

Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula and Madison Keys are Nos. 3, 4, and 5 as they head to their home WTA 1,000 in Miami. All of them call Florida home, though only Gauff was raised there.

Can they stay in this rare air? That's a tough one to answer. Pegula missed the clay-court swing last year with an injury, so she has a lot of opportunities to corral points over the next few months. Keys is in good shape, too. Sabalenka ended her 16-match winning streak but Keys is a terrific clay-court player.

The biggest question mark could be Gauff. She is comfortable on clay, but she's the only one of the three who is reconstructing her game. She has changed her grip on her serve, which changes her motion; she's still figuring out how and when to play aggressively on her forehand, which has been an attackable weakness for too long. She's been willing to take the one-step-back-two-steps-forward approach but consequently, from match to match, even she doesn't know which version of herself will show up.

Matt Futterman

Last Thursday was the first time that an ATP Masters 1,000 or a men's singles Grand Slam draw had three semifinalists born in the 2000s, according to Opta.

Draper, Holger Rune and Alcaraz were the 2000s representatives, with only Daniil Medvedev from the 1990s cohort. The '90s generation, also known as the “sandwich generation,” was already squeezed between the Roger Federer-Rafael Nadal-Novak Djokovic axis and the rise of Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner; Draper and Rune also making good on their potential would squeeze them further. Medvedev is one of two male players born in the '90s to win a major; Thiem is the other.

Draper took out Taylor Fritz, another child of the '90s, on his way to the Indian Wells title, and his move into the top 10 could be followed by a resurgent Rune and Ben Shelton.

Top-10 '90s stalwarts, including Andrey Rublev, Casper Ruud and Medvedev, are starting to look over their shoulders as the demographics at the top of men's tennis shift.

How to save a break point in a WTA 1,000 final, by Mirra Andreeva.



🎾 ATP: 

🏆 Draper (12) def. Rune (13) 6-2, 6-2 to win the BNP Paribas Open (1,000) in Indian Wells, Calif. It is his first ATP Masters 1,000 title.

🎾 WTA:

🏆 Andreeva (9) def. Sabalenka (1) 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 to win the BNP Paribas Open (1,000). It is the Russian's second successive WTA 1,000 title.

📈 Andreeva moves up five places from No. 11 to No. 6 after her win at Indian Wells. It is a career-high ranking for the Russian, 17.
📈 Draper ascends seven spots from No. 14 to No. 7 after his win. It is a new career-high ranking for the Brit, 23.
📈 Belinda Bencic reenters the top 50 after rising 13 spots from No. 58 to No. 45.

📉 Alex de Minaur drops out of the ATP top 10 after Draper's win — the Australian falls to No. 11.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news","Second Serve: Success for Mirra Andreeva and Jack Draper in Indian Wells, plus Sonay Kartal's rise up the rankings","https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c78ex9g4v7jo","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:47:40 GMT","

In the first edition of Second Serve, a weekly snapshot of the tennis tour, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko looks at the success stories from Indian Wells.

Mirra Andreeva had an important apology to make right after winning the Indian Wells title.

Looking to her coaching team, she said sorry for being ""as you like to say, a little brat"" before her match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka.

It's easy to forget Andreeva is just 17. She is playing with the maturity of a seasoned professional - and already cleaning up at some of the biggest tournaments on the WTA Tour.

Having become the youngest player to win a WTA 1000 event when she triumphed in Dubai last month, she continued her form in Indian Wells and lifted the trophy on Sunday with her 12th successive victory.

Impressive, right? 

But her achievement is made even more remarkable by the fact she beat Iga Swiatek and Sabalenka - the world's top two players - over the weekend.

The way she regrouped after dropping the second set 6-1 to Swiatek was impressive, as was her mental fortitude after losing the first set of the final against Sabalenka.

No wonder the prodigiously talented teenager is being tipped as a future world number one - and Grand Slam champion.

Talk naturally leads to which Slam that is most likely to happen at, as it will with Britain's Jack Draper, who triumphed in the men's final.

In truth, it could be any of the four, as Andreeva possesses a skillset suited to any surface.

The Russian agrees, saying: ""I like to play on clay, I like to play on hard, I like to play on grass. So I can say that all three of them are my favourites.""

Draper beats Rune to win Indian Wells title

Teenager Andreeva 'runs like rabbit' to stun Sabalenka

When Sonay Kartal lost in Indian Wells qualifying, she checked out of her rented accommodation and expected to be flying out of California.

Plans quickly changed. The British number three was picked out as a lucky loser - a player who takes a place in the main draw despite being beaten in qualifying - and went on to enjoy a memorable fortnight.

A heavy defeat by Sabalenka ended the run, but Kartal climbs 20 places to a career-high of 63rd in the world rankings as a result.

While Kartal is the biggest mover, former world number three Maria Sakkari dropped 22 places.

Sakkari, who was defending points from her run to last year's Indian Wells final, has tumbled out of the top 50 for the first time since 2019.

On the men's side, Tallon Griekspoor jumped nine places to 31st in the world after causing a shock on his way to a first Masters quarter-final.

Few people gave the 28-year-old Dutchman a chance of beating top seed Alexander Zverev - especially given he had never beaten a top-five player in 18 previous attempts.

But Griekspoor, a talented player with a powerful baseline game, stunned an out-of-sorts Zverev in a comeback win and carried his momentum to reach the last eight.

Draper and Kartal were not the only British players to enjoy success in Indian Wells.

In the women's doubles, Olivia Nicholls reached her first WTA 1000 final alongside Slovakian's Tereza Mihalikova.

Nicholls, 30, has surged up the doubles rankings since forming a partnership with Mihalikova last May.

Despite their loss to Dutch-American pair Demi Schurrs and Asia Muhammad, British number one Nicholls has soared to a career-high 31st in the world.

Britain's strong stable of men's doubles players, led by Australian Open champion Henry Patten, all lost in the Indian Wells second round.

All-British pairs Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski, Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash, plus Jamie Murray joined Patten in an early exit.

From Indian Wells, we go straight to Miami for the second half of the 'Sunshine Double'.

This is another combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 event. It is the tier below the four Grand Slams and one of the most prestigious prizes in the sport.

Novak Djokovic, as ever, is one of the most intriguing storylines as the 24-time major champion looks to avoid a third straight defeat.

Defending men's champion Jannik Sinner is missing as he serves a three-month ban for a doping offence, though reigning women's champion Danielle Collins - who planned to retire last year before doing a U-turn - will return.

From a British perspective, Draper, Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter, Cameron Norrie and Draper are named in the main draw.

Starting on Tuesday, the Miami Open culminates on 29-30 March and is the final hard-court event before the season moves to the European clay-court swing.

With so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep across everything from one week to the next.

The Salida High School tennis team swept their first two opponents of their season, beating Sierra 7-0 on March 11 and St. Mary's 6-1 on March 12, both in Colorado Springs.

Sierra is a very new team, assistant coach Kristi Miller said, resulting in the sweep. 

Senior Caroline Wooddell, the No. 1 singles player, said, “We came out with a 7-0 win, which was so fun. It's a great way to start the season.”

Junior Chloe Epperson, No. 3 singles player, said, “I think a lot of girls were really eager to start playing.”

Miller said the team learned the next day that the St. Mary's team was very talented. “(We) were not expecting them to be so experienced.”

St. Mary's has a good tennis program, Wooddell said, and in recent years the Lady Spartans have always been “neck-and-neck” with them. “This year we swept them 6-1.”

Of her own match, which she lost 0-6, 2-6, Wooddell said her opponent was one she has faced the last three years and who was undefeated in the last regular season. 

“Last year I lost with the same set score, but I felt like I played a lot better this year,” she said.

Wooddell said her favorite match to watch was Epperson's, which she won in a tiebreaker, 5-7, 6-3, 7-5. “She just battled to the very end.” This is Epperson's first year playing singles.

Miller said of Epperson's match, “She was really playing well from the baseline.” Epperson's opponent was giving her deep shots and slice shots, Miller said, and Epperson had to adapt.

Of St. Mary's match, Epperson said it was difficult going into a third set. “That was very hard mentally.” Her takeaway, she said, was “we can all do hard things if we put our minds to it.”

The No. 1 doubles team, sophomores Kiernee Torline and Nevaeh Talley, also had a close match, which they won 6-4, 6-4, Miller said. “They had to really get some strategy together in the second set,” she said, and the duo worked on deep returns and playing at the net.

Wooddell said, “It was definitely a more tough competition,” and additionally, “back-to-back matches gives a feel for the season.”

New head coach Mike Mendicino did not respond for a comment.

Hi, what are you looking for?

Howard's men's team swept the competition in their first home game against Harford, ending their three game losing streak. 

By

Published

Howard's men's tennis team hosted their first home match of the season at Banneker Recreation Center last week, where they defeated Harford Community College with an overall score of 6-1. This ended a three-match losing streak and improved their record to 3-6. 

The Bison dominated on their home turf on March 14, sweeping the three doubles contests, a remarkable rebound from their previous three matches. The game attracted members of Howard's student body to the tennis court that sits next to student housing. 

The singles competition was spearheaded by the top team of senior Marcel Dawson and sophomore Michael Major Jr., the latter of whom defeated his opponent in three sets putting him in position to becoming the team's top singles performer.

Playing on campus was meaningful to Major Jr., a human performance major. 

“It feels good to win on our home court. We practice here everyday, and it's good to see a lot of people come out. We had a lot of support and it's great that we got it done at home,” he said.

Major Jr. described the Bison's 6-1 victory as a “solidifying win” and believes that the win holds value going further into the conference.

Hannah Dessie, a sophomore on the women's tennis team explained the importance of playing close to home, allowing the Howard community to come and support their team.  

“When we get to play here it signifies that it's getting warm outside and everyone's back in their element. As I'm sitting here some of the freshmen are talking about how nice it is to have a sense of community,” she said. 

The on-court play however, spoke the loudest to Dessie.

“They won doubles 3-0. They had a tough season so far, so for them to come out in the first match and sweep doubles like that, it just shows how much they've been working,” Dessie said. 

She cited injuries as the driving force behind lineup changes, but reassured that their work from the preseason will pay off if they continue to work hard and remain healthy.   

Major Jr. pointed to the team's showing of maturity as the biggest reward of the game. He had to remain positive to ensure he won his match. 

“Sometimes when we're up, we can start to lose focus but I think everyone remained locked-in this match,” Major Jr. said. “In my doubles match, I went down early [in points] so I used the energy from my teammates and got it done.”

Though the team took a large win against Harford, Major Jr. believes there is still room for improvement, especially when playing in front of the home crowd. 

“Even though we were pretty mature, I think sometimes when the crowd is there, you want to show off,” Major Jr. said. “Also, some decision-making in some matches such as going for too big of a shot at certain times.”

With no referees present in this game, players were also tasked with upholding honesty and integrity in their calls. Major Jr. noted that despite some players' inclination to cheat, the matches remained fair. 

The Bison will return to Banneker Recreation Center to face Wagner College on March 22.

Columbia, Mo. – No. 13 Texas Women's Tennis defeated Missouri, 6-1, at the Green Tennis Center in Columbia, Mo., on Sunday. It was the second-straight SEC road win for the Longhorns and the second-straight match played on just four courts following a 4-3 win at Vanderbilt on Friday.

Texas claimed the doubles points with wins at Nos. 2 and 3 and followed with singles victories by freshmen Charlotte Kempenaers-Pocz at No. 4, No. 69 Eszter Meri at No. 2, and No. 70 Ashton Bowers at No. 1 for the clinch at 4-0. The match was then played out with wins by junior Vivian Ovrootsky at No. 3 and sophomore Shachf Lieberman at No. 6 surrounding Missouri's win at No. 5.

Following doubles, Kempenaers-Pocz was first off the singles court with a 6-1, 6-3 win over Zoe Lazar for a 2-0 overall Texas lead. After both players held on their opening serves, Kempenaers-Pocz went on a 5-0 run for the set. In the second, both again held their initial serves with both on deuce points, this time starting with Lazar. Kempenaers-Pocz then broke for a 2-1 lead that she consolidated for 3-1. She broke again for 5-2, and although Lazar managed a deuce-point break in the next game, Kempenaers-Pocz broke back for the win.

Meri was next to finish with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Inah Canete to extend the overall lead to 3-0. In the first set, Meri was the first to break for a 2-1 lead that she consolidated for 3-1. She had a break point chance in the next game on a deuce point, but Canete was able to hold for 3-2. Meri later broke again for a 5-2 lead and then won the set on a deuce-point hold. The second set began with three-straight breaks until Meri held for a 3-1 lead, which would turn out to be the only hold of the set as the last five games were all broken, including at deuce by Canete to trail, 4-2, and by Meri to win, 6-3.

The overall match was then clinched by Bowers with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-1 win over Mary Brumfield. Bowers jumped out to a 5-0 lead, including a deuce-point break for 4-0. Brumfield picked up one game on a hold, but Bowers served out the set. In the second, Bowers won the first two games on deuce points for a break and a hold and then broke again for a 3-0 lead. However, Brumfield came up with a deuce-point break in the next game, starting a 6-0 run for the set that included two more wins at deuce for 3-3 and a 4-3 lead. Bowers finished the third set the way she started match – on a 5-0 run that delivered wins for her and the team.

With the remaining contests played out, Ovrootsky completed the group of first four matches with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 win over Lailaa Bashir. After Bashir held on a deuce point to begin the match, Ovrootsky went on a 6-0 for the set, including on deuce points for 3-1 and 6-1. The second set was all breaks except for one hold by Bashir for 5-3. She then broke on a deuce point to win. Another break started the third set for Ovrootsky, who consolidated for a 2-0 lead. Bashir then held on a deuce point, which ultimately kept her in the match as Ovrootsky went on a 4-0 run for a 5-1 lead. With the match still going, Bashir got back within 5-4 before Ovrootsky finished it on serve.

The last two singles matches had begun at that point, and Missouri collected its lone point as freshman Salma Drugdova fell to Korina Roso, 7-6 (5), 6-4, at No. 5. Roso opened on a 3-0 run capped by a deuce-point hold. That would be the first of four-straight deuce points, but all resulted in holds. That last of those went to Drugdova and started a 4-0 run for her for a 5-4 lead, including another deuce-point hold for 4-4. At that point, she had a chance to serve out the set, but Roso broke to get back on serve where it stayed to a tiebreaker. In the breaker, Roso got out to a 2-0 lead, which she maintained to 4-2. Drugdova responded with a 3-0 run to lead 5-4, but Roso answered the run for the 7-5 win. Roso began the second set with a deuce-point break and a hold for a 2-0 lead. After Drugdova held for 2-1, Roso put together two deuce-point holds and a break for 5-1. Drugdova fought back to get within 5-4 and had deuce point to break and draw even, but Roso held on to take the match.

Lieberman then completed the overall scoring a 7-5, 6-0 win over Gian Octa. The first four games all went to deuce with the first two and last one resulting in breaks and a 3-1 lead for Octa. The next three games were also breaks until Lieberman held for 4-4. Octa briefly regained the lead with a hold for 5-4, but it was all Lieberman from there as she went on a 9-0 run for the match, including second-set deuce points for 2-0 and on match point.

Earlier in doubles, Bowers and Drugdova were first off the court with a 6-2 win over Canete and Andrea Artimedi at No. 2. The Longhorns secured the only two breaks of the match, first on a deuce point for a 4-2 lead and then for the match.

Meri and Carmen Herea then clinched the point with a 6-3 win over Bashir and Lazar at No. 3. Both teams broke to begin the match, starting with Missouri. With the score, 2-2, the Longhorns won consecutive deuce points to start a 3-0 run. The Tigers held off a match point at deuce in the next game, but Meri and Herea served out the match after that.

In the remaining match, Kempenaers-Pocz and senior Sabina Zeynalova were leading Brumfield and Roso, 5-3, at No. 1. The Longhorns began on a 3-0 run with back-to-back deuce points for a hold and a break. The Tigers later held on a deuce point for 4-2 and got the break back for 4-3, but Texas broke again for 5-3 before play stopped.

Texas will next return home for a pair of weekend matches starting with No. 9 LSU on Friday, March 21 at 2 p.m. CT, followed by No. 42 Ole Miss on Sunday, March 23, at 12 p.m. CT.

Jack Draper and Mirra Andreeva have both just made huge statements on the ATP and WTA tours respectively, having both triumphed at Indian Wells.

Draper admits there is still room to improve after his Indian Wells success, where he beat Holger Rune 6-2, 6-2 in their final in the desert.

Andreeva has been likened to Carlos Alcaraz, with the Russian having defeated Aryna Sabalenka 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 in their final.

Both Draper and Andreeva have achieved career-high rankings following their Indian Wells titles, with the former seventh and the latter sixth in the ATP and WTA respectively.

The Briton has climbed a huge seven places following his triumph, while the Russian is up five places after her brilliant tournament.

And both players have earned the praise of tennis legend Chris Evert, who also shared her verdict on the current state of the men's and women's games after the hard-court tournament in California.

Both Draper and Andreeva really have come on leaps and bounds in recent times, with their final victories just part of their superb Indian Wells stories.

The British number one knocked out a long list of hugely talented players on his way to another career title, including second seed Alcaraz.

And Russian teenager Andreeva, who remarkably is only 17, saw off top 10 players Elena Rybakina and Iga Swiatek before beating world number one Sabalenka.

It really is an exciting time for tennis, where the next generation of stars are quickly becoming the players to beat.

And their success also caught the attention of another legend in Rod Laver, who wrote on X: “Congratulations to Jack Draper and Mirra Andreeva on capturing the singles titles at Indian Wells.”

And tagging the BNP Paribas Open, he said: “Thank you for having me – it marked another exciting episode in tennis and I can't wait to see what transpires in Miami.”

Updated March 17, 2025 | 8:53 am

The 2025 tennis season is here, and area programs are swinging into action with a mix of postseason aspirations. From veteran rosters to up-and-coming rosters with new talent, here's a look at what each team brings to the court this spring.

Apollo

After graduating 18 seniors, Apollo enters the season focused on developing a younger group of athletes into competitive tennis players.

On the girls' side, Sophey Jennings returns as the team's No. 1. She's reached the state tournament every year she's been on varsity. Alice Wilson, who battled injuries in 2024, is healthy again, and Jessie Pate showed promise in doubles play. The boys' team will look to Jamison Framie to lead the way as their new No. 1.

“We have a bunch of new players who are athletes but aren't tennis players,” head coach Janie Walther said. “We are going to turn them into tennis players and it will be interesting.”

With such an inexperienced roster, Walther's main goal is for her team to compete at the varsity level and gain valuable match experience.

Daviess County

The Panthers came up just short last year, with both the boys' and girls' teams falling in the regional finals to Owensboro Catholic. With most of their core returning and only a few graduates lost, Daviess County is determined to flip the script in 2025.

First-year head coach Dylan McDuffee is confident in his team's potential and wants to see his players embrace every opportunity.

Leading the boys are Matthew Dunlay, Eli Bivens, and Landon McDuffee, while eighth grader Mikhail Khachikyan could make an immediate impact. On the girls' side, Alexa Salamah, Ella Boswell, and Emmie Kate Williams return as leaders, with freshman Jenna Faulkner expected to make waves.

McDuffee is focused on building confidence in his younger players and staying locked in on the fundamentals.

“As a first-year head coach, I want to stay organized and be attentive to everyone and all of the little things,” McDuffee said. “We expect to return to the regional finals and emerge victorious this time around.”

Hancock County

The Hornets' boys finished the regular season with a strong 10-4 record last year but fell short in the region tournament. Still, the team exceeded expectations and returns a group of experienced players ready to take the next step.

“We beat a couple of teams that I don't think anyone thought we were going to beat,” head coach Dan Hopkins said. “We do have some talent and some kids coming back, so I am hopeful. We have got to be ready to take it to the next level to really compete with the Owensboro schools and some of the other top schools in our region.”

Returning for the boys are Lucas Anderson, Kyle Anderson, and Tyce Boiling. On the girls' side, Ella Chappell, Audree Morris, and Kylee Bowlds lead a team still in rebuilding mode but showing signs of progress.

“I want the team to keep working hard, improving, competing well, and having positive attitudes about it,” Hopkins said. “That is the bottom line and if those things happen, other successes will take care of themselves.”

Owensboro

The Lady Devils had high expectations in 2024 but came up short of a state appearance. This year, they're back with the same fire, led by seniors Addie Travis, Whitley Ford, and Drew Crandall, along with sophomore Anna Travis.

Crandall joined the team last year and quickly established herself as a key contributor.

“She is a scrapper and showed vast improvement due to her dedication,” head coach Madeline Williams said.

Williams hopes her returning players can embrace leadership roles.

“I really want to see our returning players take the lead and be leaders for the up-and-coming players,” Williams said. “Be models on and off the court because we aren't just building athletes, but growing solid human beings.”

On the boys' side, the Red Devils lost several seniors but bring back a strong group. Sophomore John Clay Ford, the team's lone state qualifier last year, returns, along with veterans Romer Payne, Andrew Diebel, Broderick Divine, and Malik Browder.

Junior Walker Gaddis—who has his sights set on a return to the state tournament—has formed a strong doubles pairing with freshman Miles McDaniel.

Head coach Clay Ford is especially looking forward to coaching his own children.

“My daughter is a senior and my son is a sophomore,” Ford said. “This is my last opportunity to enjoy this experience with her. I am really looking forward to watching and experiencing that with her. I hope she has a lot of fun, stays healthy, and enjoys her senior season.”

Ford wants his team to compete with purpose.

“What we are focused on is mental toughness, a winning attitude, and winning effort levels,” Ford said. “We want to be a well-prepared team, but we want to be confident, assertive, and respectful of both the game itself and our opponents. And of course, I want them to have fun.”

Owensboro Catholic

The Aces swept last year's regional titles on both the boys' and girls' sides and reached the second round of the state tournament. Now, they're looking to defend those titles with a mix of proven talent and fresh faces.

The girls' team graduated six players but returns 2024 singles regional champion Ella Cason, who is chasing her fifth straight regional title. She's joined by returners Madison Clark, Lexie Moyers, Meredith Traylor, Sophia Merchant, Paige Hamilton, and Reagan Hamilton.

The boys return most of their roster, including Houston Danzer, Jack Haynes, Luke Pfeifer, John William Wathen, Joseph Merchant, Ben Haines, and Jack Haines. Fresh faces Ollie Haines and Henry Haines are expected to contribute early.

Head coach Noel Clayton has his sights set on another postseason run.

“We play a tough schedule this year,” Clayton said. “…We want to get better so we are peaking at the end of the year. Winning the team championship is a big deal for us because that determines who wins the region. We'd like to win that and take our chances in the state. I want to see everybody get better.”

Georgia women's tennis adds another SEC win to its 14-1 record after defeating Ole Miss 4-1 on Sunday. This win marks the Bulldogs' 25th win over the Rebels in the last 28 matchups.

No. 13 Dasha Vidmanova and Mell Reasco had yet another strong doubles match against No. 50 Ludmila Kareisova and Anaelle Leclerq-Ficher. The pair of seniors defeated the Rebels 6-2.

Ole Miss' Emily Welker and Alice Soulie secured their doubles match against No. 75 Aysegul Mert and Hayden Mulberry, ending their six-match winning streak. After a 6-2 loss on court three, No. 70 Guillermina Grant and Anastasiia Lopata clinched the doubles point for Georgia, defeating Andrea Nova and Brooklyn Olson 6-4.

No. 82 Grant found success in singles play against Rachel Krzyzak, securing Georgia's first singles win with a 6-4, 6-2 win on court five. With the win, the senior extended her singles winning streak to nine matches.

The Rebels added their first point to the board after Reasco fell short to Lucie Petruzelova on court three. Petruzelova defeated Reasco in consecutive sets 6-4, 6-2. No. 48 Lopata, however, brought the score to 3-1 after finding victory against Kareisova 6-3, 6-2.

No. 1 Vidmanova clinched the match for Georgia on court one against Welker. Vidmanova had a dominant first set, securing a 6-0 win. Welker battled in the second set, but ultimately could not mount a comeback. After a 7-6(5) win in the second set, Georgia maintained its perfect record against SEC opponents.

At the time of Vidmanova's win, the match between No. 41 Mert and Alice Soulie was left unfinished. Mert had a strong first match, winning 6-1. Soulie found her momentum in the second set and forced a third set after defeating Mert 6-4. The third set was left unfinished at 5-0.

On court six. Sofia Rojas was also in a three-set battle against Emma Kette. Rojas defeated Kette 6-3 in the first set, but fell in the second set 6-4. The third set was left unfinished at 0-0.

Georgia will return to Athens to face No. 70 Arkansas at the Dan Magill Tennis Complex on Friday.

Led by Henry Hunter's two towering home runs and a seven-run third-inning explosion, Georgia defeated Kentucky 17-10 on Sunday, securing its first SEC series win of the season.

The decade-long drought is over.

The Athens Rock Lobsters got back in the win column after defeating the Baton Rouge Zydeco on Friday and Saturday, clinching the Commissioner's Cup Playoffs in the process.

In the last game of the series in Colombia, South Carolina, No. 13 Georgia softball was defeated 3-2 by No. 9 South Carolina, resulting in a series loss. Georgia's record fell to 21-6 overall and 2-4 in SEC play with the loss.

The Princess of Wales has congratulated Jack Draper on the biggest win of his tennis career and praised his “fantastic performance”.

Kate, patron of the Lawn Tennis Association, tennis's governing body, paid tribute to the British number one on social media after he was crowned Indian Wells champion.

The future queen said in her post on X, which was signed off with her initial C: “Congratulations, Jack. A Fantastic performance. Well Done. C”

Congratulations, Jack. A fantastic performance. Well Done. C 👏 🏆 https://t.co/z6rwNQEUDL

— The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) March 17, 2025

The message also featured applause and trophy emojis.

Kate is a keen tennis fan and an accomplished player who regularly attends the Wimbledon Championships in her role as LTA patron.

Draper, 23, defeated Dane Holger Rune in straight sets to be crowned Indian Wells champion and win his first ATP Masters 1000 title in the tournament held in California.

He powered past Rune 6-2 6-2 in a final staged in California that lasted just an hour and eight minutes.

A life in tennis seemed inevitable for Draper considering his father Roger was the chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association between 2006 and 2013 and his mother Nicky was an accomplished junior player.

A run to the Wimbledon boys' final in 2018 showcased his full potential, but his transition on to the professional tour was troubled.

He found it tough to adapt to the grind, while later battling injuries, and he admitted he thought about quitting.

“It's really difficult. It's not the sort of strawberries and cream of Wimbledon that I expected,” he has said about life on the tour.

But victory means Draper, who beat world number one Carlos Alcaraz in the last four, is set to rise to a career-high number seven in the world rankings.

After his win, Draper said: “It's definitely a big moment for me, getting inside the top 10 and to win my first Masters title just adds to my inner belief and confidence.”","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Published: 17/03/2025

The Briton has risen up to No 7 in the world following his triumph

Jack Draper has claimed the biggest victory of his career with a dominant performance at the Indian Wells Open.

The 23-year-old Briton secured his first Masters 1000 title with a commanding 6-2 6-2 win over Denmark's Holger Rune on Sunday night.



The triumph earned Draper a massive £930,000 payday for his two weeks' work in Palm Springs.

He becomes just the fifth British man to win a Masters 1000 title, joining Andy Murray, Cameron Norrie, Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski in this elite club.

The victory also propels the Sutton lefthander to a career-high world ranking of No 7.

Draper's victory was swift and decisive, taking just 68 minutes to dispatch Rune.

The Briton fired 10 aces at his stressed-out opponent, who appeared below par throughout the contest.

Draper broke Rune's serve twice within the first 14 minutes to race to a 4-0 lead.

He secured the first set in just 29 minutes amid breezy conditions in the Californian desert.

The dominance continued in the second set with an early break of serve.

Draper's performance was so impressive that at one point, Rune applauded a forehand winner from his opponent.

The victory came less than 24 hours after Draper defeated Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-final.

After his victory, Draper sank to his knees and pointed both fingers to the sky in celebration.

""It's incredible. I wasn't expecting this. I put in a lot of work over time,"" he said.

""I feel like I deserve this in all honesty. The amount of adversity I have been through, the amount of sacrifices, the amount of time all the people around me have put into me...

""To be here now and to say I will be seven in the world, I cannot tell you how much that means to me.""

LATEST SPORTS NEWS:

Draper's fortnight of consistent tennis has catapulted him to just 60 points behind Novak Djokovic, who sits fifth in the world rankings.

This represents the most consistent tennis of his professional career to date.

""All the work I have done over the last few years, it feels like it's coming together on the big stage,"" Draper reflected.

""I knew that Holger would come out and play some good tennis. I needed to be aggressive and play to win from the first ball. I did an amazing job of that.""

Jack Draper was far too strong for Holger Rune at Indian Wells on Thursday night

This victory will have enormous reverberations throughout the year for Draper.

He will now be viewed within the tennis world as a genuine Grand Slam contender.

This new status comes at a perfect time with Wimbledon less than four months away.

Philomath News


					Local • Independent • Trusted				

Hit hard by graduation, transfers, other sports and a part-time job, the Philomath High boys tennis team enters this season with a roster of just 10 players — and only two of them bring back varsity experience.

As such, veteran coach Gary Quandt will be working this spring with a fairly green group of kids. Out of the PHS players that competed in the district tournament last year, only two of 12 are back on the local court.

“I've got a lot of newbies that have just been playing for two weeks,” Quandt said, adding that his expectations aren't very high for the season as far as how team results turn out because of the likelihood of forfeiting one, maybe two matches.

The Warriors do not return any singles players with the top two lost to graduation — state qualifier Andrew Leonard to name one — while another chose to play golf and the fourth transferred to Corvallis.

Among those who played doubles last season, junior Lane Schell brings back the most experience. Schell played at No. 1 doubles with the now-graduated Gradin Fairbanks. Senior Ahren Harris competed with No. 4 doubles at districts.


“Hands down my best player is Lane Schell and I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that,” Quandt said. “I may just rotate him around … maybe put him in doubles a couple of times, put him in singles and throw some other guys around. I really don't know what my lineups are going to be — I have to be very flexible and see what happens.”

Elsewhere, sophomores Jayden Pope and Kayden Reynolds return but they were used sparingly over the course of the season. The rest of the roster features two more sophomores in Nate Houck and Elijah Robinson along with four freshmen — Cedric Gaskey, Samuel Holroyd, Laurence Mielke and Mika Laukkanen Raskauskas.

Quandt's return as head coach was in question as PHS advertised the position after last year's campaign. At one point, it appeared that a new coach had been hired but that ultimately did not work out and Quandt had always told the school that he would continue coaching if the program needed him. He did confirm last week that this will be his last season of coaching.

“I don't know how much success we'll have but at least they'll enjoy it and get some skills,” Quandt said about the upcoming season. “Maybe next year, they can get a full team together and get a coach. That's my hope anyway.”

Philomath is scheduled to open the season, weather permitting, at 4 p.m. Tuesday at home against 5A Lebanon.

“We only have the one match and then we have Spring Break and come back and start our matches with a vengeance after that,” Quandt said. “So that'll give me an extra week or so to get the kids in playing shape.”

Quandt does see potential on the roster.

“There's some kids that with some time, they can be pretty fair players,” he said. “It's going to take some time and it's not going to happen this year but hopefully they have a positive experience and want to keep playing.”

After the season opener, Philomath will have six other matches on the home courts. The district meet will take place at Estacada for the early rounds before moving to Salem.

“We only have the one match and then we have Spring Break and come back and start our matches with a vengeance after that,” Quandt said. “So that'll give me an extra week or so to get the kids in playing shape.”

Quandt does see potential on the roster.

“There's some kids that with some time, they can be pretty fair players,” he said. “It's going to take some time and it's not going to happen this year but hopefully they have a positive experience and want to keep playing.”

After the season opener, Philomath will have six other matches on the home courts. The district meet will take place at Estacada for the early rounds before moving to Salem.

Among those who played doubles last season, junior Lane Schell brings back the most experience. Schell played at No. 1 doubles with the now-graduated Gradin Fairbanks. Senior Ahren Harris competed with No. 4 doubles at districts.



“Hands down my best player is Lane Schell and I'm not sure what I'm going to do with that,” Quandt said. “I may just rotate him around … maybe put him in doubles a couple of times, put him in singles and throw some other guys around. I really don't know what my lineups are going to be — I have to be very flexible and see what happens.”

Elsewhere, sophomores Jayden Pope and Kayden Reynolds return but they were used sparingly over the course of the season. The rest of the roster features two more sophomores in Nate Houck and Elijah Robinson along with four freshmen — Cedric Gaskey, Samuel Holroyd, Laurence Mielke and Mika Laukkanen Raskauskas.

Quandt's return as head coach was in question as PHS advertised the position after last year's campaign. At one point, it appeared that a new coach had been hired but that ultimately did not work out and Quandt had always told the school that he would continue coaching if the program needed him. He did confirm last week that this will be his last season of coaching.

“I don't know how much success we'll have but at least they'll enjoy it and get some skills,” Quandt said about the upcoming season. “Maybe next year, they can get a full team together and get a coach. That's my hope anyway.”

Draper beats Rune in Indian Wells final - highlights

When Jack Draper had to retire injured from his Australian Open match against Carlos Alcaraz in January, some people asked the same old questions.

Was the Briton's body built for success at the top of a physically demanding sport? Could he get over the line mentally in career-defining moments?

Eight weeks later, Draper has answered any lingering critics.

On Sunday, he won the biggest title of his career at Indian Wells. He has also cracked the world's top 10 for the first time.

This is how the 23-year-old has done it.

Draper was coping with a hip problem at the Australian Open and required a regular intake of painkillers to play.

He came through three gruelling successive five-setters to reach the fourth round - showing he had already improved his durability - but it eventually took its toll against Alcaraz.

Afterwards, Draper admitted he may need to manage what he described as hip tendonitis throughout the rest of his career.

More difficult choices had to be made.

The British number one skipped the Davis Cup tie against Japan and also pulled out of a tournament in Rotterdam in early February.

He returned later that month, finishing runner-up at the Qatar Open before heading to Indian Wells.

Ultimately, the ""sensible"" decision to retire against Alcaraz - and manage his workload since - has paid off.

Having greater belief in his body allowed the left-hander's technical and tactical talents to flourish in the Californian desert.

Consistent serving - a mixture of dangerous, swinging deliveries out wide and flatter, pacy serves - laid the platform.

His forehand switched from punchy to loaded with spin, keeping opponents guessing, while sharp footwork allowed him to stay in rallies longer.

Coach James Trotman, who has worked with Draper since he was a teenager, has been a driving force in his success.

""Jack has a way of playing that we should be looking to execute first and foremost,"" he told the ATP website., external

""A big part of [our] journey is to try and impose his weapons and take the racquet out of his opponent's hand.""

Welcome to Second Serve - your new weekly tennis briefing

Former world number one Andy Murray might be in Novak Djokovic's coaching box nowadays, but the long-time flagbearer of British tennis continues to have an influence on Draper.

Two core pillars of the recently-retired Scot's team - physiotherapist Shane Annun and fitness coach Matt Little - are now part of Draper's inner circle.

Just two years ago, Draper was lamenting being known as ""the guy who got injured all the time"".

Building his fitness in the gym has allowed him to compete more regularly on the tour - instrumental in his rise up the rankings.

""Being away from home, waking up early on a daily basis – it's like groundhog day,"" Draper told BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller.

""Putting in hours and hours on the court, in the gym, in the ice bath at the end of the day when I don't want to.

""It's like a normal job. Some days you really enjoy it and other times you don't want to get out of bed.

""But you do it anyway and do it to the best of your ability because you know it is going to pay off on the big stage.""

Off the court, Draper has spent nights in Indian Wells playing Monopoly Deal - a shorter version of the classic board game - and refuelling with healthy takeaways.

""As much as I enjoy playing, being around my team and doing the right thing, it's one thing saying you'll do the hard work and another to do it when you're tired and really don't want to,"" Draper added.

""That is what feels good when you're playing well on court.""

Jack Draper won the third title of his career in Indian Wells and moved up to a career-high ranking of seventh in the world

Draper's rise over the past year has been solid and steady.

His first trophy came on the Stuttgart grass in June last year, followed by an ATP 500 hard-court title in Vienna in October.

His run to the US Open semi-finals captured the attention of the wider British public, although his nerves were illustrated by vomiting on court in a defeat by eventual champion Jannik Sinner.

Draper began seeing a ""breathing coach"" to help solve the issue, and he pointed to the way he came through the third set against Alcaraz as an example of his improved composure.

""I had a few doubts before the Indian Wells final wondering if would feel the same things - but I didn't,"" he said.

""I was really strong and focused on my breathing and things I could control. That's what I was really proud of.""

The next step from Masters champion is a logical one - becoming a Grand Slam champion.

Winning Indian Wells is no guarantee of future major success but as Dominic Thiem, Naomi Osaka and Bianca Andreescu have shown, coming through a 96-player field of the very best opponents is a strong indicator.

Hard courts have been Draper's most successful surface, but the next two majors are on the French Open clay-courts and Wimbledon grass.

So far he has struggled on clay, but his improved footwork should help, while the increasingly dangerous serve and groundstrokes are suited to grass-court success.

""I still feel I have a lot to prove on the clay,"" Draper added.

""I didn't get it going last year, but I don't see why I can't be pushing the best players on that surface.

""As for grass, I feel my game has improved massively since last year.""

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey isn't happy the Mountaineers' men's basketball team missed out on the NCAA tournament.

Morrisey held a press conference Monday, reading from a podium featuring a sign that read ""National Corrupt Athletic Association."" He announced that he has asked state Attorney General John McCuskey to open an investigation into the NCAA selection committee to find out whether any ""backdoor deals"" were made.

“West Virginia deserved to be in the NCAA tournament,"" Morrisey said. ""This is a miscarriage of justice, and robbery at the highest level.”

After going 19-13 overall, and 10-10 in conference play, West Virginia was considered a safe bet to be one of the 68 teams selected to play in the NCAA tournament. A surprise loss to last-place Colorado during the first game of the Big 12 tournament, however, may have dashed the Mountaineers' hopes of playing for a national championship. When the brackets were revealed Sunday, West Virginia did not make the cut. The team quickly emerged as one of the biggest snubs of the tournament.

Head coach Darian DeVries and athletic director Wren Baker both released statements after West Virginia failed to make the cut. DeVries said the team was “shocked, saddened and disappointed” with the news. He added that he believes the Mountaineers had a résumé worthy of being part of the 68-team field, and that — despite the news — he was incredibly proud of what the team was able to accomplish. Baker said he was “heartbroken” by the snub, and claimed the Mountaineers' record was “better than several teams in the field.” Baker did not specifically call out any teams that made the NCAA tournament over West Virginia in his statement.

Following the bracket reveal, North Carolina emerged as one of the most questionable selections for the tournament. The Tar Heels went 22-13 overall and finished 13-7 in conference play. The team pulled off an upset over Wake Forest in the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament before falling to top-seeded Duke in the semifinal round. Entering Sunday, North Carolina was firmly on the bubble for the NCAA tournament. They made the final cut as an 11 seed.

The team's inclusion in the field of 68 drew even more ire than other questionable selections considering Tar Heels athletic director Bubba Cunningham chaired the selection committee. Cunningham said he was not in the room when the committee decided to include North Carolina in the final bracket. He added that “all of the policies and procedures were followed” when it came to the team's selection.

That explanation was apparently not enough for Morrisey, who said during an interview with Newsmax on Monday it was “ridiculous” and “outrageous” that West Virginia failed to make the cut. He accused Cunningham of bias, saying there was a “little home cooking going on in North Carolina.”

This isn't the first time that Morrisey has taken on the NCAA. While serving as state attorney general, he was successful in a lawsuit that challenged transfer rules. He suggested Monday that the Mountaineers' snub may have been payback over that case.

""Is this retribution? We're gonna have to get to the bottom of that,"" Morrisey said.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

BYU came in at No. 17 in Monday's top 25 ranking, maintaining the same poll position as last week.

BYU is one of five Big 12 teams listed in this week's poll, joining No. 2 Houston, No. 9 Texas Tech, No. 15 Iowa State and No. 21 Arizona.

In last week's Big 12 tournament, the Cougars defeated Iowa State in the conference quarterfinals before falling to Houston in the semis.

Monday's poll is the first this season in which the Cougars are ranked higher than former BYU head coach Mark Pope's Kentucky squad, who fell down to No. 18.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news","The ""insider"" game has changed, dramatically","https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/the-insider-game-has-changed-dramatically","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:38:34 GMT","

The NFL, unlike any other American sport, has spawned a class of national “insiders.” And the “insider” game has changed, dramatically.

Full disclosure: I guess I'm one of them, even if my approach is different. I mainly hope to find out, and to report, things they don't want us to know. To uncover and highlight the inconvenient truths (like the year-to-year structure of Sam Darnold's deal). To push the storylines that tend to hold the stewards of the game accountable (even if it pisses them off and prompts complaints to NBC) in the hopes of improving the product.

I've got no interest in reporting on transactions that will be announced in as little as five minutes after the tweet is posted. I'll take the periodic nugget that lands in my lap, but I won't play the game the “insiders” now have to play in order to get a head's up on a new contract or a trade or a release or any other move that is about to be made.

The “insider” industry started as an extension of actual journalism. The pioneer was Will McDonough. Chris Mortensen widened the trail that McDonough blazed. Nowadays, however, “insiders” are everywhere. And most of them operate not as journalists but as hand-picked conduits for information that could be given to any, some, or all of them. (They'll be upset with that characterization. Regardless, the shoe fits.)

We've addressed in the past the fact that teams often engineer the manner in which news of, for example, a new contract will be revealed. Five minutes before the deal is announced, it will be reported to the world by a hand-picked “insider.” In most of these cases, there's no longer a firewall between reporter and subject. Instead, it's become a symbiotic relationship — in the dynamic between both insiders and teams and insiders and agents.

One of the most significant developments in this regard happened upon the launch of NFL Network in 2003. When the league started hiring, and paying, reporters to cover the various teams that own and operate the NFL's in-house media conglomerate, a boundary was crossed. Not as conspicuous as the Rubicon, it was subtle. It seemed normal and natural. And anyone (like me) who pointed out the obvious conflict of interest for those who were paid by the league to cover the league was dubbed an agitator at best, an asshole at worst. (The shoe fits for me, too.)

Right or wrong, the arrival of NFL Network shoved the “insider” industry toward where it now is. Today, when it comes to any transaction that teams and/or agents can announce on their own or hand to an “insider,” any “insider” who hopes to receive and report that information is necessarily compromised by the importance of maintaining the relationship that positioned the “insider” to get the scoop in the first place.

Last week, for example, the many Twitter reports (when Twitter was actually, you know, functioning) regarding new free-agent deals were littered with public recognition of the agents who negotiated the contracts and, at times, gratuitous praise for what a great deal it was. The General Manager that negotiated the contract was never mentioned, because team executives aren't the sources for free-agent contracts. The information almost always comes from the agents, and securing a spot on the group text the agent disseminates now includes: (1) reporting only the new-money average, which is always higher than the value of the contract at signing; (2) reporting the injury guarantee, which is always greater than the true, full guarantee; and (3) mentioning by name the agents who negotiated the contract.

It's not an accident. It's the current cover charge for being an “insider.” Anyone who can't or won't play along won't get the texts.

More recently, another strange dynamic has become obvious. When it's time for the “insiders” to do their insider thing, with all of them getting the same information at or about the same time, they always behave as if they're the only ones who reported it.

It became glaring over the past 12 hours, in connection with the report regarding the contracts signed by Bengals receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. Jordan Schultz of Fox somehow managed to elbow his way to the front of the line. He tried to call it an “exclusive,” but it wasn't. He simply got the information before it was handed to other “insiders.”

And even though much was made a few weeks ago regarding Schultz's alleged methods for positioning himself (with or without offers of Uber stock) to get the information first at best or simultaneously at worst, the rest of the insiders simply ignored the fact that Schultz had it first. Hell, some are trying to make it look like they had the news before Schultz, because it was reported on Friday by others that the deals were close.

The audience doesn't care who reports the news. They just want the information. The teams and the agents, for the most part, see the value in spoon feeding the information to one or more “insiders.” There's a mutual benefit. The “insiders,” by snatching scoops, are able to justify their existences — and their salaries. The teams and/or the agents get their news publicized for free, before making the formal announcements.

The “insider” industry isn't going anywhere. But it has definitely morphed into its own category of media. “Insiders” aren't journalists. They're external P.R. reps, whose packaging as a press release of what otherwise would be hard news boosts the outlets that employ them, while also making each transaction seem like a bigger deal. And, for the agents who drive the “insider” bus (especially during free agency), it's a way to push embellished (and, at times, fraudulent) numbers into the NFL bloodstream while also getting a free Twitter advertisement that can then be used to recruit more clients.

It's the NFL's version of the circle of life. Throughout the year, the “insiders” harness and spread the information that teams and/or agents choose to disseminate through them. During free-agency week, the competition among the “insiders” has prompted each of them to set aside nagging concerns such as whether the information being shared with the audience is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. That's because, on the mean streets of #scooptown, he (or she) who hesitates to ask questions or get clarification or confirm accuracy has already lost the thumb race to Twitter.

Five months after more than 300 college basketball teams began the season with championship dreams, the number of contenders is now down to 68.

With the NCAA men's basketball tournament revealing its 68-team bracket Sunday, NBC News is here to break down the teams and players to know, from the top seeds to the potential Cinderella stories.

The men's championship will take place April 7 in San Antonio's Alamodome. Connecticut, which won consecutive championships in 2023 and 2024, begins its title defense as a No. 8 seed.

Greif: Florida. The West Region is the tournament's most difficult on paper with the top-seeded Gators surrounded by St. John's, Texas Tech and Maryland, all of which are ranked in the nation's top 12 by Ken Pomeroy, whose rankings are something of a Bible in the sport.

By winning the brutal SEC Tournament — it was by far the nation's best conference this season and produced 14 NCAA teams — the Gators have shown they can prevail in a loaded field, but they appear to have been given the most difficult top draw.

Auerbach: Auburn and Florida. Duke is still the best team in the country, as long as presumptive No. 1 NBA draft pick Cooper Flagg can play. Houston is weirdly underrated even though it is Kelvin Sampson's best (and healthiest) group yet. I like both of those teams to get to the Final Four. I'm equally concerned about the two other No. 1 seeds. 

Auburn lost three of its final four games heading into Selection Sunday, which concerns me a bit considering the Tigers could face Tom Izzo's Michigan State Spartans in the Elite Eight. Izzo has taken eight different teams to the Final Four, and this particular team has that type of DNA. 

On a completely different note, I'm worried about Florida because of the path it drew. The Gators are red hot and playing as well as anyone in the country coming into this tournament, but they have St. John's as the No. 2 seed, Texas Tech as the No. 3 seed and Maryland as the No. 4 seed in their region. That might be too tough a path after a treacherous regular season in the SEC.

Nadkarni: I'm a little nervous for Duke. Yes, I know the Blue Devils won the last two games of the ACC Tournament without Flagg — and I'm aware things are trending toward Flagg's playing in the first round — but I wonder if Duke is a little vulnerable with its best player nursing an injury. 

Is there any part of Flagg that will be cautious with his much-hyped NBA career on the horizon? Couple that with how every school treats the Blue Devils like their own personal national championship when it comes tourney time, I'm curious to see how Duke responds early in the bracket.

Greif: Akron, because of its offense. The 13th-seeded Zips, who face fourth-seeded Arizona in the first round, play at one of the country's fastest tempos and make the fourth-most 3-pointers per game. They should be able to play at their preferred pace because their opponent also likes to play fast. More possessions and more field-goal attempts equal more opportunities to knock off a higher seed.

Auerbach: Drake. The Bulldogs have already been one of the best stories in all of college basketball — and that's not just because their adorable live bulldog mascot, Griff II, stole the show at the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament. 

After having won four Division II national championships at Northwest Missouri State, Ben McCollum jumped up to Division I and promptly started winning basketball games at this level. Drake won both the MVC regular season title and the conference championship in his first season.

This is a team that rebounds extremely well on both ends while forcing a lot of turnovers, which means the Bulldogs typically get significantly more scoring opportunities than their opponents. And they rank dead last in the nation in tempo, maximizing possessions even more by playing at such a slow pace that they have more chances to score than their opponents, and their opponents feel more pressure because they won't have many chances to make up for empty possessions. That's a winning combo, and, as I like to say in March, styles make fights.

Nadkarni: Can you be a Cinderella story if you're the sixth seed? I don't care, because I'm picking the Missouri Tigers. Missouri finished fifth in Kenpom's adjusted offensive efficiency, and I like riding with a team that can score in March. Beyond that, the Tigers finished 0-18 in the SEC last year. That's right — Missouri is coming off a defeated conference season. The Tigers' simply making the tournament out of a loaded SEC is a Cinderella accomplishment in its own right. The school should have a good chance to keep it rolling in March.

Greif: Oh, you mean other than the most obvious answer of Duke's Flagg, the odds-on favorite to be the top pick in June's NBA draft but who injured his ankle last week? In that case, I want to watch 6-foot-10 big man Johni Broome of top-seeded Auburn, who, like Flagg, is a semifinalist for the Naismith Trophy, which goes to the country's best player. 

I also want to watch the way Creighton's Ryan Kalkbrenner, another Naismith semifinalist who tied Patrick Ewing as a four-time winner of the Big East's Defensive Player of the Year award, deters opponents from attempting shots near the rim.

Auerbach: Cooper Flagg, Johni Broome and Zuby Ejiofor

Flagg is self-explanatory, assuming he's healthy. He's projected to be the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft and is unbelievably entertaining to watch, which is why his injury during the ACC Tournament was such a bummer. Thankfully, he's expected to play in March Madness — and here's hoping he's close to 100% so we get to see if one of the best teams in the nation all year ends up being the best team in this tournament.

Broome, Auburn's best player, may be the nation's best player. It's Flagg vs. Broome for all the National Player of the Year awards, and rightfully so. The old-school vet and walking double-double has led the Tigers all season long, and he'll try to carry this team all the way to a national championship over the coming weeks. Despite losing three of its last four games, Auburn remains poised for a deep March run because of its age and experience, led by Broome.

Ejiofor, the St. John's center, has had some massive performances when the Johnnies needed him most — most recently with a career-high 33 points in the semifinal of the Big East Tournament and the buzzer-beater against Marquette in the team's regular-season finale. 

""I have been coaching for 50 years,"" St. John's coach Rick Pitino said this weekend. ""There are very few Zubys to come along.""

Pitino himself will be one of the biggest storylines of March Madness, which means we'll all get to learn more about this team and its many tough, dynamic playmakers.

Nadkarni: I'll also avoid the obvious choice in Flagg and give some love to Florida's Walter Clayton Jr. here. Any time I can watch a guard who likes chucking it from deep in the tournament, I will tune in. Clayton fits the bill. 

Like Flagg and Broome, he is a Naismith Trophy semifinalist. And he shoots over seven 3-pointers a game, connecting at nearly a 38% rate. I want to watch Clayton let it fly for the Gators.

Greif: St. John's, Auburn, Gonzaga and Wisconsin. Bruce Pearl and the Tigers end up winning their first national title. 

Auerbach: Michigan State, Duke, Houston and Florida, with the Blue Devils winning the national championship. Assuming Flagg is healthy, the best team in the country will be the one that cuts down the nets.

Nadkarni: St. John's, Auburn, Alabama and Clemson, with Rick Pitino's Red Storm winning it all.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news","LA 2028: Boxing set to be included after International Olympic Committee approval","https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/ce8yjx61wd6o","Mon, 17 Mar 2025 12:22:26 GMT","

Boxing has been at every Olympics since its debut in 1904 apart from in 1912

The International Olympic Committee executive board has recommended that boxing be included at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.

The sport was not part of the initial programme when it was announced in 2022, but last month World Boxing was given provisional recognition as the sport's international governing body.

The recommendation will still need to be approved by the IOC at this week's session in Greece, but outgoing IOC president Thomas Bach expects it to be given the green light.

""After the provisional recognition of World Boxing in February we were in a position to take this decision,"" Bach said on Monday.

""This recommendation has to go to the session, but I am very confident they will approve it so that all the boxers of the world then have certainty they can participate in the Olympic Games in LA.""

The creation of a new global body was the biggest hurdle to the sport's inclusion in the next Games.

The IOC has run boxing at the past two Olympics after the International Boxing Association (IBA) was suspended as the sport's world governing body in 2019 over governance, finance, refereeing and ethical issues.

The Russian-led IBA was then stripped of its status in June 2023 over a failure to implement reforms.

The IOC was at loggerheads with the IBA during last year's Olympics in Paris over the participation of two boxers, Algeria's Imane Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting.

The IBA banned the fighters midway through the 2023 World Championships saying they had failed gender eligibility tests, but the IOC allowed them to compete and both won gold medals in their weight classes.

World Boxing was formed in April 2023 and now has 84 members across five continents, including Great Britain.

Last month the IOC said World Boxing met several key criteria for provisional recognition.

President of World Boxing, Boris van der Vorst, welcomed Monday's announcement.

""This is a very significant and important decision for Olympic boxing and takes the sport one step closer to being restored to the Olympic programme,"" he said.

""I have no doubt it will be very positively received by everyone connected with boxing, at every level throughout the world, who understands the critical importance to the future of the sport of boxing continuing to remain a part of the Olympic movement.

""On behalf of everyone at World Boxing I would like to thank the Executive Board of the IOC for the trust they have placed in our organisation and we hope for a positive outcome when the IOC Session meets this week.

""World Boxing understands that being part of the Olympic Games is a privilege and not a right and I assure the IOC that if boxing is restored to the programme for LA28, that World Boxing is completely committed to being a trustworthy and reliable partner that will adhere to and uphold the values of the Olympic Charter.""

The IOC has said only athletes whose national federations were members of World Boxing by the time of the start of the qualification events for the 2028 Olympics could take part in Los Angeles.

The dates for the qualifying period are yet to be confirmed.

Perhaps the biggest shock after the 2025 NCAA Tournament men's basketball bracket was revealed on Sunday was seeing the North Carolina Tar Heels as one of the ""First Four"" teams that will play San Diego State to determine who will be the No. 11 in the South Region. 

There's a large contingent that isn't too happy with that decision by the selection committee. 

Social media erupted with backlash after the Tar Heels were named as the last team of 68 to make it in, and there's some backing to that vitriol.

UNC, despite the program's historic pedigree, was just 1-12 in Quadrant 1 games, which the selection committee determines as a game against a team that is ranked in the top 30 of the NET (the NCAA's evaluation tool) at home, against a team ranked 1-50 on a neutral court, and 1-75 in away contests. 

Bubba Cunningham, the Tar Heels athletic director who also happens to be the chair of the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee, explained the process that went into UNC making it in. 

""Obviously, I'm going to defer that to [vice committee chair] Keith [Gill],"" Cunningham responded after being asked about UNC getting in and how it wasn't a conflict of interest. ""But all the policies and procedures were followed. And Keith can address exactly how North Carolina was discussed because I was not in the room for any of that.""

Gill responded, ""Our policies require the AD of any school to recuse themselves and actually leave the room for those discussions. And they're not allowed to participate in any vote as well. ... We voted in four teams in the field on Saturday night, and we had a contingency vote.

""The contingency vote, that was the last team in the field. And it was based on Memphis-UAB. If Memphis won that game, then that was going to free up a spot in the tournament and that was going to be North Carolina.""

Despite the responses about why UNC got in, social media commenters wasted no time reacting when seeing the Tar Heels' decision. 

""Maybe the worst team ever to get an at-large bid,"" one commenter on X said. 

Another added, ""How did this even happen??""

""1-12 vs Q1,"" one explained. ""NC State was the highest NET team ever left out in 2019 with a net of 33. The reason was a 3-9 Q1 record.""

It wasn't entirely backlash, though, as some brought up the Tar Heels' recent games against some of the best teams in the country. 

""Like it or not, the Tarheels over the last month are amongst the Top 30-40 teams in the country just based off current form,"" one commenter said. ""If you want the maximum quality in the tourney, it's a no brainer.""

Another added, ""Why is anyone upset about UNC having to play into the NCAA Tournament? They were 33rd in [KenPom ratings] and 36th in NET. Their Quad 1 losses include, Kansas, Alabama, Auburn, Michigan St, and Duke, with many coming down to the wire. UNC deserved to get in.""

UNC finished 22-13 overall and 13-7 in ACC play while winning two games in the ACC Tournament before being bounced by the No. 1-seeded Duke Blue Devils in the semifinals.

Meanwhile, teams like Indiana, West Virginia, Boise State and UC Irvine – all of which were on the bubble – didn't get in despite having competitive resumes. 

Each year, teams on the bubble are heartbroken when their name isn't called during the selection show. It's an unfortunate part of the game, but ultimately, the decision is final. 

The Tar Heels will play the Aztecs on Tuesday night to determine who will be the No. 11 seed facing off against No. 6 Ole Miss in the South Region.

03/15/25  Mirror photo by Patrick Waksmunski     /     
Bishop Guilfoyle's Morgan Ruggery (left) and Anberlyn Petrecca enjoy the win.

Many of the players for Bishop Guilfoyle Academy have already been all the way through the gauntlet of needing to win five PIAA playoff games in a couple weeks to become a state champion.

The players the Lady Marauders took the court against on Saturday in the PIAA quarterfinals had never even won a state playoff game before this season.

It showed — early.

Bishop Guilfoyle, which won in the PIAA semifinals on the same Altoona Area High School Fieldhouse court they played on again Saturday last year, defeated District 6 third-place finisher Saint Joseph's, 66-48, on the strength of a 28-2 run to open the game.

“I think when we played Norwin on the road, we also had a start like that,” Bishop Guilfoyle coach Kristi Kaack said. “We talked about how when you're playing in the state playoffs, it's win or go home now. When you only have 32 minutes to do the job, you have to have the start, and that's what we have been talking about all week — how important it was to be ready from the tip — and they definitely were tonight.”

Morgan Ruggery got the run started with a jump shot and made another after 3-pointers by Anberlyn Petrecca and Layona Williams to make it 10-0.

Williams made a lay-in and three free throws, Mary Haigh hit the first of her three 3-pointers and Gia Adams made the first two of her five 3-pointers to make it 24-2 after a quarter. Ruggery made a 3-pointer and a free throw to make it 28-2 early in the second quarter.

“I don't know about a nightmare, but that was their first time being in a situation like this,” Saint Joseph's coach Bethany Irwin said. “I'm extremely proud of this group of girls, because we have only played a year and a half together. From last year to this year, we got much better. We went further than we did last year, and that's always been a goal to do that. I'm really proud of them. We hung with them the last three quarters. It was just that they made everything and we missed everything in the first quarter.”

Bishop Guilfoyle got double figure scoring from five different players. Adams finished with a team-high 15 points followed by Haigh's 13 points. Williams, Petrecca and Maurie Querry each added 10 points and Ruggery scored eight.

Adams is still coming off the bench after missing much of the second half of the season due to a hand injury, but she's recently found her shooting touch after struggling with her shot early in the season.

“Honestly, just getting my rhythm back and having the confidence to put the ball through the net has helped,” Adams said. “My teammates set me up really well for my shots, and I feel like that really helped tonight.”

Bishop Guilfoyle finished with 12 3-pointers in the game — though the Lady Marauders aren't known as an outside shooting team.

“These kids can all shoot the ball,” Kaack said. “But we also ask them to really get into our plays and get to the rim. We're capable of it, but we just have different weapons when we play. Tonight, the 3-point line was good to us.”

All of the 3-pointers helped counteract Saint Joseph junior Naomi Crispin, the daughter of former Penn State player Joe Crispin, who made six 3-pointers and finished with a game-high 25 points.

“Saint Joes is a solid team,” Kaack said. “The Crispin kid is pretty unbelievable. She was really deep on some of those shots. I think any good team is going to fight back, and I think they just clawed back in as best as they could.”

With the help of Crispin and Aubrey Yartz, who finished with 13 points and 14 rebounds, the Wolfpack outscored BG, 46-42, after the first quarter, but the hole was too deep.

“There was a tremendous amount of growth,” said Irwin regarding her team that finished 26-3 with losses only to BG and Bishop Carroll twice. “From team unity, team communication, believing in each other and just so much growth from player one through 10. We only had 10 players, and from my last player to my first player, they all showed tremendous growth throughout. I'm extremely proud of all of them.”

Earlier in the day, Bishop Carroll Catholic eliminated Williamsburg with a 60-47 win in the other PIAA quarterfinal in the lower bracket, and Bishop Guilfoyle will play the Lady Huskies with a trip to Hershey and the state championship on the line at the AAHS Fieldhouse Saturday at noon.

“We told them in the locker room to not let this moment get lost on them, because they got to do it last year,” Kaack said. “There are a lot of teams that want to be in our position right now and aren't, so we told them to take tonight and tomorrow to really soak in what they have done this year and that we would get back to work on Monday.”

Seeing four District 6 teams in the PIAA Class 1A quarterfinals and the leaders that got them there led to a sense of pride from Irwin, who led the State College girls basketball team for several seasons prior to her time at Saint Joseph's.

“District 6 has always been strong in Class 1A,” Irwin said. “Bishop Guilfoyle has always been strong. Williamsburg has always been strong. Bishop Carroll has always been strong. It's fantastic to see four district teams playing each other in the state quarterfinals. I also find it fantastic that there were three women coaches out there instead of male coaches all the time. I think I coached against those two when they were players — so I'm getting really old.”

Stella Yeskey, who started at forward for Bishop Guilfoyle earlier this season before suffering an injury, was dressed for the game and sat on the bench in uniform but did not play. Though, she may return before the end of the season.

“We're working really hard for that,” Kaack said. “We're crossing our fingers. She's still day-by-day, and we're seeing how she feels.”

A week off between games should help as the Lady Marauders continue their quest to defend their PIAA championship on Saturday against Bishop Carroll.

“It feels amazing just being back here with the atmosphere and hopefully getting to states again,” Adams said. “I love doing this with my teammates, who I love.”

BISHOP GUILFOYLE (66): Williams 3 3-4 10, Querry 3 4-7 10, Ruggery 3 1-2 8, Petrecca 2 4-6 10, Haigh 4 2-2 13, Adams 5 0-0 15, Gofus 0 0-0 0, Homan 0 0-0 0. Totals — 20 14-21 66.

A look back at local, national and world events through Deseret News archives.

On March 17, 1925, the Deseret News released its annual All-State boys basketball team.

And the anticipation of who would make the squad was no doubt great, just as it is today.

For the record, the first team that season consisted of Lund from Dixie High, and Watts from Murray at forwards, Worthington from Nephi at center, and guards Collins from Provo and Blake from Dixie.

No first names, interestingly enough, and the squad include a second team and roll of honor.

Just think, for more than 100 years, the Deseret News sports team has been honoring high school athletes for their performances.

High school football games have been held in Utah since 1898, and in boys basketball since with all-state teams listed on the Deseret News high school sport website since 1929.

High school basketball all-state teams are listed going back to the 1907-08 season.

Since then, the Deseret News has continued to cover high schools like no other, from those early sports to the 25 boys and girls team sports contested each school year. And the Deseret News honors those who excel with all-state team designations.

In its current format, all-state teams are selected in a vote of coaches of teams that compete each season. Additionally, for the past three decades, the Deseret News has selected MVPs and Mr. Basketball and Ms. Basketball honorees (two decades), following the same pattern in other sports as well.

It's a full-time process, and Deseret News sports editor James Edward — and an honor roll of high school sports writers and correspondents before him — keep churning out the the predictions and previews, the game coverage and the recaps, as well as all the supporting statistics.

You can see it all at Deseret News High School Sports.

The 67 postseason matchups -- including four First Four competitions -- will air on truTV, CBS and TNT. A full schedule, including game times and channels for the First Four and opening round, is listed below.

Freshman phenom Cooper Flagg -- the projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft -- and the Duke Blue Devils (31-3) are the outright favorites to win the championship.

They earned one of the four No. 1 seeds and will start their run Friday against American (22-12) or Mount St. Mary's (22-12), two No. 16 seeds who will meet in a First Four game at 6:40 p.m. Wednesday in Dayton.

The Auburn Tigers (28-5), who earned the No. 1 overall seed, will take on Alabama State (19-15) or Saint Francis (16-17) on Thursday in Lexington, Ky.

""For us, we sort of feel like it makes us the regular-season national champion, but it is a tournament sport,"" Tigers coach Bruce Pearl told reporters, when asked about the top seed.

""We are six wins away from winning our first national championship.""

The top-seeded Florida Gators (30-4) will start their run Friday against No. 16 Norfolk State (24-10). The Houston Cougars (30-4), the other top seed, will face Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (22-11) in their opener Thursday in Wichita, Kan.

The No. 2 Tennessee Volunteers, No. 3 Texas Tech Red Raiders, No. 3 Iowa State Cyclones, No. 2 Michigan State Spartans and No. 2 St. John's Red Storm are among other expected contenders.


The No. 8 UConn Huskies (23-10), who won the last two titles, are not among among the Top 10 favorites for the March Madness crown.

Just two of the SEC's 16 teams -- LSU and South Carolina -- failed to make the NCAA tournament cut, setting a record for the most teams from one conference to participate. The Big East, which sent 11 teams to the tournament in 2011, held the previous record.

No. 9 Baylor's V.J. Edgecombe, No. 11 Texas' Tre Johnson, No. 4 Maryland's Derik Queen, Duke's Khaman Maluach and Kon Knueppel, Michigan State's Jase Richardson and No. 6 Illinois' Kasparas Jakucionis are among top projected NBA Draft picks to watch.

No. 5 Memphis' P.J. Haggerty, who ranks third in the nation with 21.8 points per game, is the top individual scorer. No. 10 New Mexico's Donovan Dent (20.6), No. 4 Purdue's Trey Kaufman-Renn (20.2) and No. 14 Lipscomb's Jacob Ognacevic (20.1) join Texas' Johnson (19.8) and Dukes' Flagg (18.9) among the other prolific bucket-getters set to compete.

No. 8 Gonzaga's Ryan Nembhard, who averaged a national-best 9.8 assists per game so far this season, will attempt to guide the Bulldogs into contention. Purdue's Braden Smith (8.7), Tennessee's Zakai Zeigler (7.3) and No. 9 Creighton's Steven Ashworth (6.8) are among the other top assist men in the tournament.

New Mexico's Nelly Joseph (11.2), Baylor's Norchad Omier (10.9) and Auburn's Johni Broome (10.6) are among the top rebounders.

A total of 32 teams will advance to the second round on Saturday and Sunday. Sweet 16 games be March 27 and 28. The Elite Eight will be March 29 and 30. Final Four games will beApril 5 in San Antonio. The Final Four and finale will air on CBS.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Most U.S. adults think betting on professional sports should be legal — but they don't feel the same way about college sports, according to a new poll.

The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that about 6 in 10 Americans think betting on professional sports should be legal in their state, but only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults say the same thing about legalized wagering on college sports. More than half oppose legal betting on college sports.




After years of opposition, professional sports leagues have embraced legalized wagering, agreeing to lucrative sponsorship deals with gambling companies in the aftermath of a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that allowed states to legalize sports betting.

College conferences and teams have largely stayed away – a separation reflected in the poll results, as some Americans continue to think there should be a distinction between professional and college sports.

Colleen Plowman, who lives in Kansas, is among those who think betting should be legal for professional sports but not for college. She says that younger athletes might be less well-equipped to handle the pressure of having bets placed on their games.

“I think once they get out of school — not that it couldn't happen — they have more maturity to deal with all the pressures that go along with that,” said Plowman, who said she does not bet. “I assume there would be a lot of pressure on kids at that age. I think there would be more pressure on college kids than it would be on pro.”




Sports betting is now legal in 38 states and the District of Columbia, and Missouri narrowly passed a ballot measure in November that paves the way for legalization this year. Each state with legalized sports betting has its own set of regulations regarding what can be wagered on and in what form.

Despite these shifts, Americans aren't more open to either kind of sports betting than they were a few years ago. They about as likely to say betting on professional or college sports should be legal as they were in 2019.

And the public appetite for sports betting doesn't seem to have grown, either. In the new poll, about one-quarter of U.S. adults said they “frequently” or “occasionally” bet on professional or college sports with friends or through an office pool, down from 36% in 2019. About one-quarter said they bet at least “frequently” in person at casinos, and 14% said they regularly wager online, both of which are generally unchanged from six years ago.

The growth of legal sports betting has prompted concerns about increased stress on athletes and the potential for wrongdoing.

A suspected gambling ring under federal investigation for its role in two NBA betting cases also was reportedly involved in unusual wagering activity on at least three men's college basketball programs. In 2023, about two dozen college athletes were criminally charged after a state investigation in Iowa into illegal sports wagering, though some charges were later dropped. That same year, Alabama fired its baseball coach amid an investigation into suspicious bets involving a Crimson Tide game.

Jodie Campbell, who lives in California, agrees that if sports betting is going to be legal in her state, that it should be for pro events and not college. But Campbell, who said she does not bet, had issues with legalized wagering in general.

“I feel a little bit conflicted about it,” Campbell said. “On one hand, I think sometimes with betting you can create a situation where there's an opportunity for dishonesty, fraud or misconduct. ... I'm just not a big fan of gambling and betting generally. If it was up to me, it would be great not to have any of that. I prefer to keep it out of sports involving young people, like high school, college level.”

John Markley, who lives in Delaware, says he thinks both forms of gambling should be legal but with some limits at the college level.

“It's OK to bet (on) a team, I believe, but individually, probably not,” said Markley, who said he regularly bets small amounts of money. ""... It seems (athletes would) be more vulnerable to influence to throw a bet, influence a game, something like that. Probably anyone is, but probably a younger, less affluent person might be more subject to influencing a game on behalf of a bettor.”

Sanders contributed from Washington.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,112 adults was conducted Feb. 6-10, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — The Miami Dolphins added linebacker help, signing veteran K.J. Britt on Monday.

Britt spent the past four seasons in Tampa after being drafted by the Buccaneers in the fifth round out of Auburn in 2021. He made 15 starts with 59 appearances for the Buccaneers, recording 105 tackles (56 solo), a 1/2 sack and three passes defensed. He also made appearances on special teams with 21 tackles.

Britt has appeared in six postseason games with two starts, 21 tackles and one pass defensed.

It's the latest move the Dolphins have made to bolster their defense, which finished as the fourth-best unit in 2024.

Miami lost safety Jevon Holland, linebacker Anthony Walker Jr. and defensive lineman Da'Shawn Hand in free agency but re-signed linebackers Quinton Bell and Tyrel Dodson and added safeties Ifeatu Melifonwu and Ashtyn Davis.

Welcome to the St. Patrick's Day edition of the Pick Six newsletter! 

Apparently, everyone in the NFL got the memo that today is St. Patrick's Day because every NFL owner is handing out pots of gold. OK, well not every owner, but Bengals owner Mike Brown and Texans owner Cal McNair have been feeling very generous over the past 24 hours. 

In Cincinnati, Brown handed out a total of $276 million in new contract money to Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. In Houston, McNair made Derek Stingley Jr. the highest-paid cornerback in NFL history. 

We'll be covering all three of those deals today, plus more, so let's get to the rundown.

As always, here's your daily reminder to tell all your friends to sign up for the newsletter. To get them signed up, all you have to do is click here. And remember, you can pinch them if they're not wearing green today and you can also pinch them if they don't sign up for the newsletter. 

The Bengals have long had a reputation for being cheap, but no one is going to be using that word to describe them anymore after what they did on Sunday night. Bengals owner Mike Brown opened up his pocketbook and handed out a total of $276 million in contract money to Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. 

The Bengals had a chance to get these contracts done last offseason, but things got acrimonious between the team and its two star receivers. This year, they finally got a deal done with each guy. 

Here's what you need to know: 

You can check out our full story on the Bengals' record-setting deals here. Also, I broke down why the Bengals got out of their comfort zone this offseason and you can check that out here. 

The Bengals aren't the only team that handed out a record-setting contract heading into St. Patrick's Day; the Texans also threw a pot of gold at Derek Stingley Jr. 

The cornerback got a historical new deal, and here's what you need to know: 

The biggest winner of the Stingley deal might be Sauce Gardner. The Jets corner is due for an extension soon and there's a good chance he'll be looking to top Stingley's record-setting number. 

We've got the full details on Stingley's record-setting deal, and you can check those out here. 

The biggest problem with trying to build an NFL team is that you're never done building. Even if you fill a few of your needs in free agency, there are always going to be other needs. 

With that in mind, Josh Edwards decided to take a look at every team's biggest remaining need after one week of free agency: 

You can check out the biggest need for each of the 28 other teams here. 

There's no one here at CBS Sports who knows more about NFL contracts than Joel Corry, and the reason Joel knows so much is because he used to be an NFL agent. 

After taking a look at every contract that has been signed over the past week, Joel made 10 contract-related observations and we're going to take a look at three of them. 

Corry has seven more observations, and you can check those out here.  

It's time for another edition of Mock Draft Monday, which is where we hunt down one of our NFL Draft gurus and force them to give you a new mock draft since there's no better way to start the week than with a fresh mock draft. 

This week's mock is coming from NFL draft analyst Josh Edwards, who has THREE quarterbacks going in the first round. 

Let's check out his top 10: 

1. Titans: QB Cam Ward (Miami)2. Browns: EDGE Abdul Carter (Penn State) 3. Giants: CB/WR Travis Hunter (Colorado) 4. Patriots: OT Will Campbell (LSU) 5. Jaguars: DL Mason Graham (Michigan)6. Raiders: WR Tetairoa McMillan (Arizona) 7. Jets: OT Armand Membou (Missouri)8. Panthers: EDGE Mykel Williams (Georgia) 9. Saints: QB Shedeur Sanders (Colorado) 10. Bears: RB Ashton Jeanty (Boise State) 

If you're wondering where the other first-round quarterback ended up, don't worry, I'm not going to leave you hanging. Josh has the Steelers taking Mississippi's Jaxson Dart with the 21st overall pick. 

If you want to see how the rest of the first round pans out, then be sure to check out Josh's entire mock draft here. 

For more draft coverage, you can hear Ryan Wilson every week on ""With the First Pick,"" our year-round NFL Draft podcast here at CBS Sports. You can find ""With the First Pick"" wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify and YouTube. 

It was a busy weekend in the NFL, and since it's nearly impossible to keep track of everything that happened, I went ahead and put together a roundup for you.

While nagging can build frustration, a little reminder never hurt anyone.

The Detroit Red Wings have been a busy team over the last week. Like the rest of the NHL, they are dealing with the aftermath of a hectic trade deadline.

Bookmark The Hockey News Detroit Red Wings team site to stay connected to the latest news, game-day coverage, and player features. 

*Highlights from the Red Wings' most recent win.

Last Sunday (March 9th, to be precise), Red Wings newcomers Petr Mrazek and Craig Smith joined the team for their first practice. Their new jersey numbers were also revealed at that time.

Detroit Red Wings Schedule For March 2025

Can The Red Wings Make The Playoffs?

 Red Wings Playoff Chances Haven't Evaporated (Yet) So, you are saying there's a chance?  

The following day, the Red Wings took on the Ottawa Senators in a very important matchup. They ultimately lost the contest 2-1, with goaltender Linus Ullmark pulling out all the stops - 48 of them.

Players can only participate in a playoff run if they are acquired by the NHL's Trade Deadline. However, teams are still allowed to make trades. The Red Wings AHL affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins, pulled off a minor deal with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins by acquiring defender Nikolai Knyzhov for future considerations.

Swedish prospect Axel Sandin-Pellikka is having a season. Just this past week, he set an SHL record. Additionally, rumors are swirling that he will join the Red Wings once his SHL season and playoffs have reached their end.

While this hasn't been officially confirmed at this time, all signs point to it being the case.

The Red Wings broke a streak of bad luck by walloping the Buffalo Sabres 7-3. Patrick Kane had a huge night, recording two goals and three assists in 17:21 minutes of work to propel them to a victory.

Another Swedish defenseman made headlines with the Red Wings last week. Anton Johansson signed a three-year entry-level contract with the team. The 6-foot-4 right-handed defender has played full-time in the SHL for the last two years and will report to the Griffins under an AHL tryout.

And just when you thought things were going well, the Red Wings get handed another loss. This time, it came at the hands of the Carolina Hurricanes. Alex DeBrincat and Michael Rasmussen scored for the Red Wings in a 4-2 result.

Thanks to Trey Augustine, Michigan State is going to the Big Ten Championship game. Augustine is having quite the season. He's already won a World Junior Gold Medal with Team USA this season, and adding another Big Ten Championship would put an emphatic exclamation point on his season.

Finally, the Red Wings capped off their week by gaining ground on the final Eastern Conference Wild Card spot. They earned a 3-0 shutout victory over the Vegas Golden Knights. Mrazek earned an 18-save shutout while Albert Johansson, Lucas Raymond, and Marco Kasper contributed the run support.

The Frewsburg girls basketball team celebrates after defeating Section V's Keshequa 58-44 in the Class C Far West Regional at the Buffalo State Sports Arena on Saturday.

BUFFALO — The Frewsburg girls basketball team reached the New York State Public High School Athletic Association championships for the first time in program history last year and this season the Bears have been on a mission to get back there. 

After getting through a tough Section VI tournament, the Bears had one more obstacle in the way, which was the state's top-ranked Class C team in Section V's Keshequa. 

For the Bears, who started the season atop the rankings, they showed it was barely an obstacle as they began the Class C Far West Regional at the Buffalo State Sports Arena with a 12-0 run and never looked back en route to a 58-44 victory on Saturday. 

“It means a lot,” Frewsburg head coach Sierra Beaver said about returning to states. “This group has played together for a long time; they're probably the hardest-working group I've ever worked with. They do whatever I ask of them and so to see them rewarded with that opportunity is a lot of fun.”

Keshequa got itself on the board at the free throw line and trailed 19-10 after the first quarter, but it was when Frewsburg starting hitting shots from long range that the Bears began to pull away. In the second quarter, in nearly three consecutive possessions Frewsburg received 3-pointers from Teghan Trocki, Taytum Jimerson and Jadyn Trocki.

“We work on being able to get to the rim, mid-range jumpers and shooting the three,” Beaver said about the versatility of the offense. “We talk about just take what the defense gives you. If you have a lane to drive, go, if you don't have a look, find someone that does. Just don't play selfish and work the ball.”  

Frewsburg first established its 20-point lead in the second and even with a whole half to play the pressure was really on Keshequa to come up with an answer. The Wildcats managed just three field goals in the period and by halftime the score was 34-17. 

“Our team is so successful because we have five kids who can score,” Jadyn Trocki said. “It's so cool how unselfish we are and I think that's what helps us win.” 

Frewsburg's hot start captivated the entire building and even set off the fire alarm at the Buffalo State Sports Arena, causing what amounted to be roughly a five-minute break in the third quarter. Several fans even began to evacuate before the alarm ended. 

“It adds a little more excitement to the win,” Beaver said about the fire alarm going off during the game.  

Keshequa came out stronger in the second half, but the Bears were still too much for them defensively. Anytime it looked like the Wildcats were going to chip away at the lead, Frewsburg would get a basket. 

“They had a couple of players that are generally their focus,” Beaver said about the defensive game plan. “We practiced how we're going to get through their screens. … But playing team defense, somebody gets beat the next person steps up and helps that person too.”

The Wildcats started the final quarter on an 8-2 run and Frewsburg took its first timeout with 4:22 remaining holding a 49-37 lead. Then, just when Keshequa thought it might be getting back into the game, Frewsburg resumed play after the timeout with another 3-pointer from Teghan Trocki, showing there would be no comeback.

“We play as a team as much as we can,” Teghan Trocki said. “We know we all have to score in order to win, so we play for each other. It's not just one person scoring all the time.”

Teghan Trocki finished with a game-high 18 points, six boards and a block; Jadyn Trocki had 10 points, five rebounds, six steals, six assists and two blocks; Ava Jimerson scored 10 points with seven boards and four assists; and Abery Harvey had five rebounds. Keshequa had just one scorer reach double digits with Braelynn Isaman scoring 17.

“We always talk about if we're a one-dimensional team we're easy to defend,” Beaver said. “So we pride ourselves on having a lot of people who can score all the time. It's hard to stop five people who can score in double figures.”

Frewsburg closed out the game 58-44 and clinched its second trip to states in program history.

“The first time you do anything is always nerve-racking,” Beaver said. “Last year we got there and you walk out onto that court and there's all the cameras. It's tough mentally to not get nervous, but I think this time we'll be a little bit more calm. We know what to expect.”

Last year was the first trip for all of the Frewsburg girls to states, but now they return determined and experienced.

“We worked hard all year in order to get to this point,” Teghan Trocki said about getting back to states. 

“I feel like this is a really big year for us,” Jadyn Trocki added. “We have a bunch of seniors on the team so I feel like this is our year to do it.”

A transformation of women's soccer in Europe is well under way

This Small-Town Team in Sweden Was a Women's Soccer Powerhouse. Then Europe's Big Clubs Took Over

UMEA, Sweden (AP) — Sprinkled around its small, shared office are trophies and mementos signifying the not-so-distant glory days of Swedish women's soccer team Umeå IK.

On one wall is the No. 60 jersey worn by its greatest ever player, Brazil superstar Marta. Across the corridor is a bookcase crammed with European and Swedish silverware and medals. Gathering dust in the corner of a room nearby is a trophy for the 2003 UEFA Women's Cup, the precursor to the Champions League.

Indeed, it's only 21 years ago that the team from this small northern city virtually unknown outside Sweden was a back-to-back European champion.

Now Umeå is adjusting to its new status in women's soccer — languishing in Sweden's second division, playing before average attendances of around 400 spectators, and battling debts.

A transformation of the women's game in Europe is well under way. As attendance figures and TV ratings rise, big-money clubs already well established in men's soccer – think Barcelona, Real Madrid, Chelsea – are taking over the show.

Umeå is among the unfashionable clubs of yesteryear who know they can no longer compete.

“Not to be harsh or anything, but I don't think it's possible anymore,” Umeå coach Edvin Erfanian said about the club's chances of returning to the top of the European game. “But I don't necessarily see it as a bad thing. The product of women's football is a whole lot better than it was 20 years ago.”



  Champions League lineup
 

The changing face of women's European soccer is best illustrated by comparing the lineup of the Champions League quarterfinals taking place this week to that of 20 years ago.

On Tuesday, it's Real Madrid vs. Arsenal and Bayern Munich vs. Lyon. On Wednesday, it's Wolfsburg vs. Barcelona and Manchester City vs. Chelsea.

Rewind to the 2004-05 season and the quarterfinalists included Bobruichanka Bobruisk (Belarus), Energy Voronezh (Russia), Trondheims-Ørn (Norway), Turbine Potsdam (Germany), Torres (Italy), as well as Djurgården/Älvsjö and defending champion Umeå from Sweden.

Arsenal, a rare example of a top men's club that also had a strong women's team in those days, is the only quarterfinalist from 20 years ago that remains competitive in the Women's Champions League today.

The contrast in resources is considerable.

Barcelona, the reigning European champion, generated 17.9 million euros ($19.5 million) in revenue in 2023-24, according to analysis from accountancy firm Deloitte. Jörgen Crovin, Umeå's sporting manager, estimates that Umeå's revenue last year was about $800,000.



  Accepting a new reality
 

Umeå IK is a club located around 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the Arctic Circle — the winters here are long and cold — and in a quiet university town populated by 130,000. The team has been surviving year-to-year, even week-to-week as recently as last November when a last-gasp crowdfunding campaign and donations from wealthy locals raised enough cash to keep the team afloat.

Expectations and targets have been realigned. Being European champion again is a pipe dream for a squad containing many students and only three full-time professionals. Crovin joined in 2022 and says the players brought in during his time have all been free transfers. Chelsea, meanwhile, just made U.S. defender Naomi Girma the world's first million-dollar female player.

Instead, returning to Sweden's top division and consolidating with a strong youth system and robust finances, while serving as a pipeline for the best players in the north of the country, is the best Umeå's soccer leadership can realistically hope for these days.

“We just need to find our own way,” Erfanian, a 28-year-old coach, told the AP. “We don't have the finances and, in the end, that's what it's about. ... For us, what we need to do is put our resources in the academy and create a good environment for young girls in the north part of Sweden.”



  The glory days with Marta
 

It's very different to the early years of this century when women's soccer wasn't such big business and Umeå was a benchmark in the European game.

In lore in these parts is the cold, gray day in February 2004 when an 18-year-old Marta, reportedly wearing flip-flops, arrived in Umeå from Belo Horizonte with her cousin, Marina, and threw a snowball for the first time in her life. Within months, Marta was scoring in both legs of the Champions League final against FFC Frankfurt as Umeå retained the title before losing the 2007 and '08 finals — by which time she was the Ballon d'Or winner.

“It's pretty much a different world up there — really small place, really cold — and she adapted,” Johanna Frisk, a teammate of Marta's at Umeå and now a pundit for Swedish broadcaster Viaplay, told the AP. “Her skills were on another level. She could do pretty much anything.”

Umeå was a “winning machine,” Frisk said. For Crovin, the club “raised the bar” in terms of how much they trained and the ambition they had in using their money, pumped into the club from local and national businesses, to buy foreign players.

“Umeå was ahead of its time,” Crovin said in an interview in a cluttered office the club now shares with the city's indoor floor hockey team.



  The powerhouses take over
 

Sponsors started to leave and debts started to build for Umeå. Marta left after the 2008 season and the team hasn't won a major title since.

Around that time, Europe's powerhouse clubs started taking women's soccer seriously. Paris Saint-Germain won its first major women's title in 2010 and soon was fueled by cash from the men's team's Qatari ownership. Barcelona won its first Spanish women's league title in 2011. Bayern Munich, which wasn't in Germany's top women's league during much of the 1990s, started winning cups and leagues in the 2010s. Manchester United's women's team was reformed in 2018, having been disbanded in 2005. Real Madrid's women's team was founded in 2020.

With resources, infrastructure and a brand name behind them, the big-name women's teams are flourishing. Even in Sweden, Malmö — the biggest men's club — relaunched a women's team in 2019 that just got promoted to the top division.

According to a Deloitte report, the 15 top revenue-generating women's clubs whose financial results were available for analysis brought in more than 100 million euros (dollars) combined for the first time during the 2023-24 season, a year-on-year growth of 35%.

“Investing in women's football is proving to be a good business decision, benefitting both brand recognition and the business models of football clubs,” Jennifer Haskel, knowledge and insight lead in Deloitte's sports business group, said.



  The future for women-only soccer clubs
 

It seems the best way to be a strong, financially sound women's team is to be linked to a successful men's club — or have an owner with deep pockets.

Crovin says there are no immediate plans for Umeå to be affiliated with the city's men's team, which also plays in the second tier in Sweden and doesn't have so strong a brand.

Similarly in Germany, Turbine Potsdam — the Champions League winner in 2005 and ‘10 based outside Berlin — has slumped as hard as old rival Umeå amid the changing financial landscape. It's also an independent women's team, with a recent co-operation with the Hertha Berlin men's team lasting only three years.

Demoted in 2023 after 26 years in Germany's top division and now battling to avoid a return to the second tier after promotion last year, Turbine has struggled to bring through enough talented young players in recent years to get close to competing with powers like Bayern and Bayer Leverkusen.

“We need money,” Turbine president Karsten Ritter-Lang told the AP. “It's really, really difficult to find sponsors ... I'm absolutely sure if we have enough money and we develop our sports school system, then it will be possible to be successful as an isolated women's football club.”

The Auburn Tigers were selected as the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA men's basketball tournament Sunday.

Joining the Tigers as No. 1 seeds will be the Duke Blue Devils, the Houston Cougars and the Florida Gators.

Auburn will be the No. 1 seed in the South Region, with the Cougars leading the Midwest, the Blue Devils atop the East and the Gators headlining the West. 

The full bracket was revealed on Selection Sunday, with the tournament scheduled to begin Tuesday with the First Four before the opening round begins Thursday.

One of the more intriguing two-seeds are the St. John's Red Storm, led by coach Rick Pitino. The Red Storm finished 30-4 in the regular season, including an 18-2 record in the Big East. Pitino has already led three teams to the Final Four and is the only coach to win national championships at two different schools. He can now add to both totals this spring. 

Duke, meanwhile, enters March Madness with a little bit of a question mark despite its seeding. The Blue Devils had to play the last two games of the ACC Tournament without star forward Cooper Flagg, who injured his left ankle during the conference tourney. 

Duke coach Jon Scheyer said Saturday that Flagg was “trending in a great way” to be ready for the first round. 

As for teams more on the fringe, a controversial pick to take part in the First Four are the North Carolina Tar Heels. The Tar Heels were on the bubble but earned the chance to play for the 11th seed in the South. (The school's athletic director, Bubba Cunningham, is the chairman of the selection committee but says he recused himself from any discussion surrounding North Carolina's inclusion.)

Other notable schools that were on the bubble who sneaked into the tourney include Texas (which benefited from the strength of its conference), the Longhorns' First Four opponent, the Xavier Musketeers, and the San Diego State Aztecs.

The Tar Heels, Musketeers, Aztecs and Longhorns were the last four teams in, according to the NCAA. 

The first four schools that were left out were two Big Ten stalwarts, the Indiana Hoosiers and the Ohio State Buckeyes, and the West Virginia Mountaineers and the Boise State Broncos.

The SEC will be well represented in the bracket, with a whopping 14 of its 16 teams making the 68-team field — an NCAA men's record for most bids by a single conference. 

Among the SEC's 14 selections are the Missouri Tigers, who made the tournament only one year after going 0-18 in conference play. The Tigers, who had three wins against top-five opponents in the regular season, could be a dangerous opponent. 

The first and second rounds of the tournament will run from Thursday through March 23, with the Sweet Sixteen and the Elite Eight taking place from March 27 through March 30.

This year's men's Final Four will take place in San Antonio, beginning with the national semifinals on April 5 and the national championship game on April 7.

Luka Doncic had 33 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists, and the Los Angeles Lakers snapped their four-game losing streak with a 107-96 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Sunday.

Austin Reaves scored 28 points and Jaxson Hayes matched his season high with 19 for the Lakers, who returned from an 0-4 road trip to extend their home winning streak to seven games.

Kevin Durant scored 21 points and Devin Booker had 19 for the 11th-place Suns, who missed a chance to gain ground on Dallas for the West's final play-in spot after the Mavericks lost at Philadelphia. Phoenix remained 1 1/2 games behind Dallas with a game in hand.

LeBron James (left groin strain) missed his fourth straight game, but coach JJ Redick said the top scorer in NBA history is “ramping up” toward a return.

Lakers starter Rui Hachimura (knee) also missed his ninth straight game, but Doncic (ankle) returned after sitting out Friday's loss in Denver, as did Hayes, Dorian Finney-Smith and Gabe Vincent.

Suns: A rough shooting game and their usual unimpressive defense were a bad combo. Durant and coach Mike Budenholzer also had another animated huddle exchange, this time while Phoenix was falling behind by 20 in the first quarter.

Get today's sports news out of Los Angeles. Here's the latest on the Dodgers, Lakers, Angels, Kings, Galaxy, LAFC, USC, UCLA and more LA teams.

Lakers: They fell three spots in the West during their road trip, and their current stretch is brutal with seven games in 10 days, including five at home in seven days. With Doncic and Reaves healthy, they can compete until James returns.

Phoenix trimmed its deficit to 100-92 with less than two minutes left, but Finney-Smith buried a 3-pointer to seal it.

Durant, Booker and Bradley Beal went a combined 2 of 12 on 3-point attempts. Phoenix was 9 of 41 overall.

Both teams finish a back-to-back Monday. The Suns host the Raptors, and the Lakers host the Spurs.","{'href': 'https://www.nbclosangeles.com', 'title': 'NBC Los Angeles'}"

A native of Alabama, Earl Etheridge came to Savannah in 1963 and has been entrenched in the high school sports scene in the Hostess City and Georgia ever since.

Now 87 years old, Etheridge just recently stepped down from his day-to-day duties as an athletic administrator with the city's Athletic Department, where he worked for nearly three decades in his second career after working as a coach and teacher in the Savannah Chatham County Public School system. He had coaching and teaching stints at Savannah High, Windsor Forest and Beach before stepping away to work for the City. He has also worked with the Georgia High School Association since 1967.

A member of multiple Hall of Fames, including the Greater Savannah Athletic HOF, where he has also served as the organization's president, Etheridge and his wife of 61 years, Becky, still live near Lake Mayer and have two sons and two grandsons.

Etheridge will pick up another honor for his impact on the local sports scene as the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Coastal Empire Sports Awards show, presented by Georgia Ports, on May 27th at the Johnny Mercer Theater. 

He recently took some time to talk about his life and career and why sports has been the perfect venue for his legendary work ethic.

A standout baseball and football player, as a running back and defensive back, at Escambia County High in Alabama, he started his college career at Auburn playing football before moving on to Southern Mississippi where he played baseball and earned his degree.

He and Becky came to Savannah in 1963 and he started at Savannah High as a baseball coach, assistant football coach and teacher, with classes that included typing.

""I remember those classes where we had the old Corona typewriters and the big old football players would get their fingers caught between the keys,"" Etheridge said with a laugh. ""But when Becky and I came to Savannah we had no idea about the city. But the people were so nice, we thought we ought to stay here,""

After four years at Savannah High, Etheridge moved on to Windsor Forest, which opened its doors in 1967. He did it all for the Knights serving as the schools football coach from 1968 through 1983, while also coaching the baseball teams and tripling up as the school's athletic director.

""The kids at Windsor Forest gave their all — whether they were big or small or fast or slow, they gave everything they had an put in that effort,"" said Etheridge, who posted a 73-84-2 record in 16 seasons leading the Knights. ""I was a player's coach. I tried to have a different approach with each player. They have different personalities, just like coaches do. I was hard on some and easier on others. I remember we had two players get into a fight at practice one day, so I made them walk around the track holding hands for the rest of the practice. I think that made an impact on them. They were good friends and never did that again.""

John Sanders is a Windsor Forest graduate from the class of 1980. He was a standout golfer who didn't play on Etheridge's teams, but said everyone knew the man.

""He was loved and feared at the same time,"" Sanders said. ""But Earl did so much for the school and for sports in the Savannah community. He had a big impact on his players' lives and then when he started working with the GHSA he always looked out for the Savannah schools. He is respected by everyone in Savannah and throughout the state.""

Etheridge started working with the GHSA in 1967 and was the Region Secretary for Savannah area schools until 2021. He has worked behind the scenes helping to organize state playoff events in football, baseball, basketball and softball and also served on reclassification committees helping to shape the competitive environment for his school sports throughout the state.

Mitchell ""Mouse"" Minick has known Etheridge since he was a kid growing up in Savannah as Etheridge was close friends with his late father, Guy, another man who had a big impact in the Savannah sports community. Mouse Minick has been working with the GHSA and traveling with Etheridge to events since the late 1990s.

""The best way to describe Earl for me is that he's a combination between a father figure and a boss,"" Minick said. ""When we drive to events, he always sits in the last seat that is the farthest away from the driver. And we'll take his two cell phones during the ride. He will get calls from everyone — including coaches like Kirby Smart and Nick Saban, who are looking to get sideline passes to see prospects playing in state championship games.""

Minick said Etheridge is a hard working, personable man who has had a big impact on the lives of those he has worked with including some of Savannah's best coaches like the late Terry Webb, James ""Buddy"" Hardy and Gary Shephard.

He said Etheridge came from the ""Old School"" style of coaching, and some of his Windsor Forest players would have tobacco stains on the front of their helmets after receiving a tongue lashing from their no-nonsense coach. He said that tough personality belies a hidden talent of Etheridge, who plays the piano very well.

""Earl is a hard worker and such a great family man,"" Minick said. ""And he's in so many Halls of Fame I'm not sure he's sure about which ones he is in. We'll be at a game and a police officer will come up to say hello and say he was a defensive tackle who played for Earl back in the day at Windsor Forest, and then every college coach will come by to talk with him. He knows everyone and has done so much for sports in Savannah and in Georgia.""

Etheridge said he can't explain why only recently retired and continues helping with the GHSA.

""I can't answer that,"" he said. ""I guess it's because I've always enjoyed what I'm doing and feel like I have something to offer. I think sports are important because they teach kids to compete and be successful in other areas of life. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose, but you always have to try to play your best.""

Rory McIlroy has won The Players Championship in a three-hole playoff against J

Rory McIlroy Takes Drama Out of Playoff to Win the Players and Build Momentum to the Masters

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The playoff was only three holes. Rory McIlroy needed only three swings. And yet his victory Monday over J.J. Spaun in The Players Championship revealed so much about the state of his game and the cruel nature of the notorious TPC Sawgrass.

McIlroy delivered an early knockout against J.J. Spaun with his best drive of the week that set up a simple birdie, followed by a three-quarter 9-iron into a cold, cackling wind that found land on the island green at the par-3 17th. 

“By no means did I have my best stuff this week,” McIlroy said after becoming the eighth multiple winner of The Players. “But I was still able to win one of the biggest tournaments in the world. That's a huge thing.”

It's the first time in his career he has won twice going into the Masters, the major that for more than a decade has kept him from joining golf's most elite group with the career Grand Slam.

Spaun thought he had the perfect answer until he saw his 8-iron sail over the island on the second playoff hole, ending his hopes of the biggest win of his career.

“Can I watch this?” Spaun said as he sat at a table, his eyes trained on a television in the back of the media center showing a replay of his tee shot on the 17th. It was his first time seeing where the ball landed — just beyond the wooden frame and into the water. He had only heard groans from the gallery.

And he still couldn't believe it.

“I never thought it was long,"" he said quietly. “I never thought it was long.”

So ended a memorable week at golf's richest tournament, where thousands of spectators showed up in the cold and wind for 47 minutes of golf between McIlroy — among the most celebrated players who now has 39 worldwide wins — and Spaun, a 34-year-old with one PGA Tour title who until this week had never broken 70 on the TPC Sawgrass.

McIlroy said he woke up at 3 a.m. and couldn't get back to sleep. Whether this was about trying to win or trying not to lose — he had a three-shot lead with five holes to play in the final round Sunday — didn't matter.

He worked on his tee shot with the same helping wind off the right. To practice in the right wind for the 17th, McIlroy turned and hit balls from the range toward the third green.

McIlroy had been spotty off the tee all week, missing nearly half of his fairways. He set the tone with his best of the week, a 336-yard blast right down the middle that set up a pitching wedge from 176 yards into the par-5 16th for a two-putt birdie from 35 feet.

“I thought if I could get the ball in the fairway there, it sort of puts a little bit of pressure on J.J.,” he said. “To step up and make that swing was awesome.”

And then it effectively ended on the 17th.

“When my ball was in the air, I was telling it to get down,"" McIlroy said.

Spaun hit his 8-iron with a higher trajectory into a hurting wind off the right, and his first instinct was to yell, “Get up.”

“It just looked like it was going to be short,” Spaun said. “I was stunned. I couldn't believe it was long. I'm happy with the swing I put on it — I am. The wind must have just laid down just a little too much, and it just went through the wind. Wasn't my time.”

The first three-hole playoff in 10 years at The Players was caused by a four-hour rain delay on Sunday. McIlroy had to make a 4-foot par putt on the 72nd hole. Spaun had a 30-foot birdie putt for the win that stopped inches short.

McIlroy, disappointed and having lost a three-shot lead on the back nine, looked ahead to the playoff by saying, “Make five good swings tomorrow morning and get this thing done.”

Turns out he only needed three — the driver and wedge on No. 16, the 9-iron on No. 17 — to beat Spaun and claim the $4.5 million prize from the $25 million purse.

It was reminiscent of a 2008 playoff between Sergio Garcia and Paul Goydos, back when the 17th was used in sudden death. Garcia hit the green. Goydos came up short and into the water, and there is no lonelier walk than to the drop zone knowing it's over.

Spaun wound up three-putting from 45 feet for triple bogey. McIlroy ran his 30-footer well past the hole for a bogey, giving him a three-shot lead. Both hit drives well right on the 18th. McIlroy took a safe bogey and Spaun didn't bother putting the 10-footer he had left for bogey.

Any mention to The Players being the fifth major or even resembling one is not where McIlroy wants to go right now because he knows the real one — the big one — is a month away at Augusta National. The trick now is to keep his game in good stead. He also won the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am last month. He plans to add one more start in Houston or San Antonio before the Masters.

“Everything feels like it's in good working order at the minute,” he said. “Just keep practicing and doing the right things and practicing the right habits, and day after day, week after week, they all add up to days like today.”

Spaun won $2,725,000 for his runner-up finish and moved to No. 25 in the world ranking, high enough that he is assured a spot in the Masters. 

“A good consolation to the week,” Spaun said.

NFL teams have been spending more like a drunken sailor this week, thanks to a higher-than-expected 2025 salary cap. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, players have collectively signed contracts worth $4.88 billion, including $2.19 billion fully guaranteed at signing since Monday.  

Once teams could officially begin contacting the agents of players with expiring contracts as the two-day negotiating window that's a precursor to the start of free agency opened on Monday, it was a seller's market as usual. The tide is turning since the first wave of free agency is essentially over. It's now a buyer's market.   

The NFL annual owners meeting, which is March 30-April 2 in Palm Beach, Florida, typically signifies the end of free agency for all practical purposes. Teams will devote most of their attention to the upcoming NFL Draft held April 24-26 after the meeting wraps up.

Here are 10 contract-related thoughts and observations relating to free agency and the early part of the offseason. 

The Buffalo Bills renegotiated 2024 NFL MVP Josh Allen's contract although he had four years worth $154,554,595 remaining on the six-year, $258 million extension averaging $43 million per year (worth a maximum of $288 million through incentives) he signed in 2021. It's extremely unusual for a team to essentially rip up a contract with four years left like the Bills did. 

It's what happened with the Cleveland Browns' ill-fated trade for Deshaun Watson in 2022. Watson had four years totaling $136 million remaining on the four-year, $156 million contract extension averaging $39 million per year he received from the Houston Texans in 2020. The Browns gave Watson an unprecedented fully guaranteed five-year, $230 million contract in connection with his trade from the Texans.

Allen received a six-year, $330 million deal averaging $55 million per year. The contract has an NFL record $250 million of guarantees. The $147 million fully guaranteed at signing is the second-most ever in an NFL contract. The deal is worth as much as $333 million because of incentives and a $500,000 annual incentive for winning the Super Bowl.

Allen was clearly focused on cash flow as opposed to maximizing the average yearly salary. His $220 million from 2025 through 2028 is the best four-year cash flow ever in an NFL contract. It surpassed the previous high of $219 million (2024 through 2027) in the four-year, $240 million extension Dak Prescott signed with the Dallas Cowboys last September that made him the NFL's first $60 million-per-year player. 

Being the reigning NFL MVP should have given Allen enough ammunition to not only become the cash flow king, but also the league's highest-paid player. Instead, Allen is tied for second in the NFL salary hierarchy at $55 million per year with Joe Burrow (Cincinnati Bengals), Trevor Lawrence (Jacksonville Jaguars) and Jordan Love (Green Bay Packers).

Reverend Run once said, ""Money is the key to end all your woes. Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows. … It's like that, and that's the way it is."" That definitely applies to Myles Garrett. 

The 2023 NFL Defensive Player of the Year publicly requested a trade from the Cleveland Browns in February during Super Bowl week because he wanted to play for a championship contender. The Browns were adamant about not trading him.

Garrett was given an offer he couldn't refuse to stay in Cleveland. The perennial All-Pro edge rusher signed a four-year, $160 million extension running through the 2030 season to become the NFL's first $40 million-per-year non-quarterback. The deal has non-quarterback records of $122,796,125 in overall guarantees and $88.8 million fully guaranteed at signing.

The Patriots entered free agency with over $125 million in salary cap space, which was easily the most in the NFL. According to OverTheCap.com, the Patriots have signed eight players to contracts worth $238.5 million with $141.4 million in guarantees where $118.4 million is fully guaranteed at signing. The Patriots are determined to improve upon the 4-13 record of the last two seasons.

The primary emphasis has been on defense. Most notably, Milton Williams signed a four-year, $104 million contract with $63 million in guarantees ($51 million fully guaranteed at signing). The deal makes Williams the NFL's third-highest paid interior defensive lineman at $26 million per year. Carlton Davis was signed to pair at cornerback with 2024 Second Team All-Pro Christian Gonzalez. He received a three-year, $54 million deal averaging $18 million per year with $34.5 million fully guaranteed. The deal is worth as much as $60 million thanks to incentives. Linebacker Robert Spillane signed a three-year, $33 million contract averaging $11 million per year with $20.6 million fully guaranteed. Incentives make the maximum value of the deal $37.5 million.

Last year's first overall draft pick Caleb Williams was sacked 68 times in 2024, which was the third-most ever in an NFL season. The Chicago Bears have made protecting Williams the focal point of the offseason. A 2026 fourth-round pick was dealt to the Kansas City Chiefs for All-Pro left guard Joe Thuney. 

Jonah Jackson was acquired from the Los Angeles Rams for a 2025 sixth-round pick. He reunites with new Bears head coach Ben Johnson, who was his offensive coordinator for his last two seasons with the Detroit Lions in 2022 and 2023. Jackson was a major disappointment after the Rams signed Jackson to a three-year, $51 million deal with $34 million in guarantees, of which $25 million was fully guaranteed at signing. He didn't have a smooth transition from offensive guard to center. 

With the free agent addition of center Drew Dalman, Jackson will be moving back to offensive guard. Dalman signed a three-year, $42 million contract averaging $14 million per year with $28 million in guarantees where $26.5 million was fully guaranteed at signing.

The Washington Commanders unexpectedly advanced to the NFC Championship game before losing 55-23 to the Philadelphia Eagles. The 12 regular-season wins were the most since the 1991 season when the Commanders won Super Bowl XXVI, the franchise's last league title. 

The first order of business was bringing back Zach Ertz and Bobby Wagner, the 34-year-old seasoned veterans, who helped changed the culture in Washington. Wagner, a future first ballot Hall of Fame linebacker, signed a one-year, $9 million deal with $8 million fully guaranteed worth up to $9.5 million through incentives. Ertz received $6.25 million for one year where $5.59 million is fully guaranteed. The three-time Pro Bowl tight end can make as much as $9 million because of incentives.

General manager Adam Peters has been active in the trade market. Wide receiver Deebo Samuel was obtained from the San Francisco 49ers for a 2025 fifth-round pick. Samuel is in his contract year scheduled to make $17,550,529 in 2025. 

Laremy Tunsil, who is one of the NFL's best pass-protecting left tackles, and a 2025 fourth-round pick were acquired from the Texans for 2025 third- and seventh-round picks as well as 2026 second- and fourth-round picks. There are two years worth $42.7 million remaining on the three-year, $75 million extension Tunsil signed in 2023 that made him the NFL's first $25 million-per-year offensive lineman. 

High-end contracts are made to be surpassed. This was evident with Maxx Crosby. The ink was barely dry on the three-year, $106.5 million extension averaging $35.5 million per year the four-time Pro Bowl edge rusher signed with the Las Vegas Raiders to become the NFL's highest-paid non-quarterback before Garrett surpassed him with a $40 million-per-year extension. 

Garrett's reign at the top of the non-quarterback landscape will likely be short-lived as well. Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase, Cowboys edge rusher Micah Parsons and Pittsburgh Steelers edge rusher T.J. Watt are entering contract years. 

Watt's 2021 extension made him the league's highest-paid non-quarterback. A history of delaying extensions that are inevitable cost the Cowboys more money in the long run. Parsons has made comments about potentially taking some sort of hometown discount, though. Bengals director of player personnel Duke Tobin has publicly vowed to make Chase, who won the receiving triple crown in 2024 by leading the NFL in receptions, receiving yards and touchdown catches, the league's highest-paid non-quarterback.

The Super Bowl LIX champion Eagles are going against the grain with their 2025 signing priorities. The NFL world was stunned when the Eagles extended the three-year, $37.75 million contract averaging $12,583,333 per year (worth as much as $46.75 million through incentives and salary escalators) with $26 million in guarantees, of which $24.5 million was fully guaranteed at signing, Saquon Barkley received in 2024 free agency. The contract was set to expire after the 2026 season.

Barkley became the NFL's first $20 million-per-year running back on a two-year, $41.2 million contract extension averaging $20.6 million per year with $36 million fully guaranteed. He arguably had the best season in NFL history for a running back. Barkley had a legitimate shot at breaking Eric Dickerson's 40-year-old, single-season record of 2,105 rushing yards before the Eagles decided to rest him for the regular-season finale against the New York Giants since the game didn't affect playoff seeding. He was named 2024's NFL Offensive Player of the Year.

There are $15 million of incentives and salary escalators in Barkley's contract. Out of the $15 million in performance bonuses, only $1.5 million were already in Barkley's old contract so $13.5 million are new.

Zack Baun was one of the biggest surprises of the 2024 season after signing a one-year, $3.5 million deal worth a maximum of $4.5 million through incentives in free agency. His transition to inside linebacker from a reserve edge rushing outside linebacker and special teams standout on the New Orleans Saints during the first four years of his NFL career went better than anyone could have possibly imagined.

Baun is the only player to ever have at least 150 tackles and five or more forced fumbles in an NFL season. He was named to the Pro Bowl and earned first team All-NFL honors both for the first time in his career because of his efforts. Baun was also a finalist for the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year award.

The Eagles did something uncharacteristic in making a major investment in an off-ball linebacker. Baun is remaining in Philadelphia on a three-year, $51 million contract averaging $17 million per year with $34 million fully guaranteed. The only off-ball linebacker contract with a higher average yearly salary ever in free agency is the four-year, $72 million deal averaging $18 million per year with $50 million in guarantees where $41.8 million was fully guaranteed at signing Tremaine Edmunds received from the Bears in 2023. 

The Eagles reset the running back market and have the NFL's fourth-highest paid off-ball linebacker. Running back and off-ball linebacker aren't considered premium positions. It could be just as simple as the Eagles choosing to reward their best players regardless of where they play.

The 49ers have been among the NFL's highest-spending teams in recent years. According to NFLPA data, the 49ers led the NFL in cash spending at $346.423 million in 2024. There's a big change occurring with the 49ers in anticipation of a massive contract extension for quarterback Brock Purdy.

Samuel was dealt to the Commanders for a 2025 fifth-round pick. His days in San Francisco had seemed numbered ever since fellow wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk was signed to a four-year, $120 million extension averaging $30 million per year with $76 million of guarantees, of which $45 million was fully guaranteed at signing, last September. 

A contract maneuver in December paved the way for defensive tackle Javon Hargrave to be released with a post-June 1 designation. Hargrave's $19.9 million 2025 base salary was cut to $2.1 million that was fully guaranteed on the second day of the 2025 league year (March 13). His 2026 base salary was raised $18 million from $21.65 million to $39.65 million. It was also fully guaranteed on the second day of the 2025 league year. 

Defensive tackle Maliek Collins, fullback Kyle Juszczyk and edge rusher Leonard Floyd were also cap casualties. Juszczyk was the NFL's highest-paid fullback at $4.55 million per year.

Offensive guard Aaron Banks, linebacker Dre Greenlaw, safety Talanoa Hufanga, offensive tackle Jaylon Moore and cornerback Charvarius Ward have departed in free agency. The Broncos signed both Greenlaw and Hufanga. Greenlaw got a three-year, $31.5 million deal worth up to $33.5 million through incentives. Hufanga's three-year contract is reportedly worth up to $45 million with $20 million fully guaranteed at signing.  

Banks went to the Packers on a four-year, $77 million contract averaging $19.25 million that's worth up to $82 million through incentives and salary escalators. Ward signed a four-year, $72 million deal averaging $18 million per year worth up to $20 million through incentives with the Indianapolis Colts. There are $34.98 million in guarantees where $27 million was fully guaranteed at signing. Moore received a two-year, $30 million contract averaging $15 million per year with $21.42 million fully guaranteed from the Kansas City Chiefs. 

The Denver Broncos gave cornerback Patrick Surtain II a four-year, $76 million extension averaging $24 million per year with $77.5 million in guarantees where $40,688,565 was fully guaranteed at signing last September as the start of the 2024 regular season was approaching. The deal made Surtain the NFL's highest-paid defensive back. The 2021 draft's ninth overall pick preceded to have a career year after signing the extension. He was named 2024's NFL Defensive Player of the Year.

Cornerback Jaycee Horn, the eighth pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, just signed a four-year, $100 million extension with the Carolina Panthers  to become the NFL's first $25 million-per-year defensive back. The maximum value is $108 million, thanks to salary escalators. The deal has $72 million in guarantees, of which $46.707 million was fully guaranteed at signing.

Durability has been a problem with Horn. He has only played 37 of a possible 68 regular-season games during his four NFL seasons. Horn earned his first Pro Bowl berth last season.

Just imagine the Broncos trying to sign Surtain after being named NFL Defensive Player of the Year and with Horn's contract in existence when he was heading into a contract year. Surtain would be justified in asking for a massive reset of the cornerback market. At a minimum, Surtain would be able to command the $27 million per year maximum value of Horn's deal as his base value.

Becoming the NFL's first $30 million-per-year defensive back wouldn't be out of the question with the Bengals planning on making Chase the league's highest-paid non-quarterback. That means eclipsing Garrett's new $40 million-per-year extension with the Browns. 

Shutdown cornerbacks, like Surtain, are rarer commodities than elite wide receivers. According to the NFL's Next Gen Stats, Surtain was on Chase for 43 of 56 coverage snaps when the Broncos played the Bengals in Week 17 last season. Surtain limited Chase to three catches for 27 yards on six targets.

The original intent of a per-game roster bonus was for a team get some type of financial relief with a player coming off an injury or because of durability concerns if there was inability to remain healthy. With this type of bonus, an amount is only payable each time a player is on the game day active roster. 

Per-game roster bonuses are becoming increasingly prevalent in NFL contracts, particularly with players who don't have a history of getting hurt. It's impossible to sign a contract of significance on multiple teams, including the 49ers and Patriots, without per-game roster bonuses. 

The Patriots are taking per-game roster bonuses to an extreme. For example, Williams' four-year contract averaging $26 million per year contains $8.5 million in per-game roster bonuses. He has $2.55 million ($150,000 for each game active) in 2027 and 2028. 

The biggest per-game roster bonus  I can recall before the Williams deal is former 49ers quarterback Colin Kapernick with $2 million annually ($125,000 per game) in his 2014 contract extension. A shoulder injury in 2015 that ended Kapernick's season after nine games cost him $875,000 since he didn't earn seven games worth of per-game roster bonuses.

Currently in Columbia















(CNN) — Officials in North Macedonia are investigating a fire that tore through a nightclub killing 59 people and injuring more than 150, with many crushed in the rush to escape flames suspected to have been sparked by on-stage pyrotechnics.

Around 500 revelers were at the “Pulse” nightclub in the town of Kochani, east of the capital Skopje, when flames ripped through the venue at about 3 a.m. Sunday morning, officials said.

Video of the tragedy seems to show sparks flying from stage props and setting the roof alight as local band DNK performed to the crowd.

One concert-goer, 22-year-old Marija Taseva, told Reuters that everyone was shouting, “Get out, get out.” She said she fell to the ground, and people trod on her, injuring her face.

Her sister didn't make it out. “My sister died,” Taseva said.

The victims range in age from 16 to 24, the head of Kochani General Hospital, Dr. Kristina Serafimova, said, according to state media outlet MIA. The majority of those who died were trampled in the crowd crush, she added.

Several members of DNK are reported to be among those killed, including Andrej Gjorgieski, one of its lead singers.

Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski said the blaze was caused by pyrotechnics used for lighting effects.

“Most likely, sparks caught a part of the ceiling that was made of flammable material, causing the fire to spread to the entire discotheque in a short period of time, creating thick smoke,” he said.

At least 152 people who were injured in the tragedy were taken to hospitals across the country, MIA reported, citing the country's health ministry. Dozens of victims are being treated for second-degree burns on their hands and faces, Vlatko Zahariev, head of the city of Shtip's hospital said, according to MIA.

Twenty-seven of the most seriously injured victims will receive treatment abroad, the health ministry said, according to MIA.

Football player Andrej Lazarov was confirmed to be among the deceased, his club FC Shkupi announced in an Instagram post Sunday. Lazarov was 25.

By late Sunday, around 20 suspects had been arrested, including members of the band, the son of the club owner, and government officials, Toskovski told a press conference. Earlier MIA reported the owner of the nightclub was among those arrested.

Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski said the nightclub's license had been issued illegally by the economy ministry, according to Reuters. He said those found responsible will face justice.

“Regardless of who they are, from which institution, from what level, from which party and profession,” Mickoski said, as he declared seven days of national mourning.

Leaders from across Europe have taken to social media to express their condolences, including Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, and Antonio Costa, President of the European Council.

Angela Aggeler, the US ambassador to North Macedonia, also posted about the incident on X, writing that her “heart breaks” for the victims of the tragedy and offering the US embassy's assistance and resources.

Pope Francis also expressed his “deep” condolences to the families of the victims.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar said Israeli medical experts will head to North Macedonia “within the next day” to provide medical assistance.

The disaster is one of the deadliest nightclub fires to have taken place in at least a decade. In 2015, a crowded nightclub in Bucharest, Romania was engulfed in flames after pyrotechnics were set off during a concert, killing 64 people.

Two years earlier, more than 240 people died after a fire broke out at a nightclub in Santa Maria, Brazil. Pyrotechnics were also being used inside the club when the fire started.

(TNND) — President Donald Trump told ""Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson"" that failing to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine would be ""bad news for this world.""

""Because so many people are dying,"" Trump told Attkisson. ""But I think ... he's going to agree. I really do. I think I know him pretty well, and I think he's going to agree.""



Russian foreign policy expert Mark N. Katz said Trump sees a continuation of the war as bad for not just Ukraine, but also Russia and the rest of Europe.

“I don't think he was making a comment on how the U.S. would react,” said Katz, a professor emeritus of government and politics at George Mason University.

Trump views the war as counterproductive, Katz said.

Trump thinks ending the war would allow Russia to normalize relations and see sanctions lifted, Katz said.

Ending the war would save lives.

And it could even open the door for U.S. investments in Russia, Katz said.

“From Trump's deal-making viewpoint, it just makes sense,” he said.

Though, he noted, Trump can't bind American corporations to invest in Russia or trade with Russia. And a lot of them have had bad experiences in Russia in the past.

Trump plans to speak with Putin on Tuesday as he pushes to end the war in Ukraine.

Ukraine has agreed to an American-proposed 30-day ceasefire with Russia.

Now, the ball is in Putin's court.



The ceasefire breakthrough arrived in talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, last week in Saudi Arabia.

The U.S. also agreed to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.

The turnaround came after a tense White House meeting at the end of last month between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump told Attkisson that he wants to end the war to save lives and money, telling her the U.S. has spent “massive amounts of money” on helping Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February 2022.

Trump told Attkisson that the U.S. has spent $350 billion on Ukraine, which is a higher dollar amount than what's been reported by other sources, including an official U.S. government website.

The Council on Foreign Relations says the U.S. has pledged $175 billion to support Ukraine via five bills passed by Congress, most recently in April 2024.



And the Council on Foreign Relations noted that a lot of the Ukraine funds passed by Congress are being spent in the U.S., paying for American factories and workers to produce weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or used to replenish American arsenals.

The U.S. is Ukraine's largest donor, but over a dozen European countries have given Ukraine a bigger percentage of their economic output as support against Russia.

Attkisson also asked Trump about his campaign pledge to end the war in 24 hours if elected.

“Well, I was being a little bit sarcastic when I said that. ... What I really mean is I'd like to get it settled,” Trump told her.

Katz said Trump likely knew that was a campaign promise he couldn't keep.

“I'm pretty sure that he knew during the campaign that he wasn't going to end it within 24 hours,” Katz said. “I think what he was trying to indicate during the campaign (was) that he would try to end it quickly.”

It won't be easy to get Putin to agree to a ceasefire, Katz said.

And it probably won't happen quickly.

“Putin has indicated that he doesn't want just a ceasefire,” Katz said. “He wants to address the root causes, as he sees them. So, he wants a ceasefire plus concessions from Ukraine and the West.”



Putin won't want the West to keep arming the Ukrainians, Katz said.

The French and British are talking about sending troops to Ukraine to provide security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire, but Katz said both nations will be wary of sending troops without American support.

Ukraine and the West might demand North Korean troops leave Russia in exchange, Katz said.

The North Koreans have been helping Russia drive back Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk region, and that mission has mostly been accomplished. So, it's possible Putin would be OK with losing North Korean support on the battlefield.

Putin likely wants to not only keep what he's gained but add the rest of the land in partially occupied Ukrainian provinces, according to Katz.

Russia controls nearly 44,000 square miles of Ukraine, or close to a fifth of Ukrainian territory including Crimea and parts of Donbas that Russia had seized before its 2022 invasion.

Russia has taken over another 27,000 square miles of Ukraine since its invasion three years ago.



And Putin wants a guarantee that NATO won't admit Ukraine, which Katz said should be viewed as an untenable demand.

NATO was created in 1949 by the U.S., Canada, and several Western European nations to provide collective security against the Soviet Union.

NATO membership is between NATO and candidate countries, Katz said.

Katz said Putin doesn't want to burn his bridges with Trump, so he's likely to entertain ceasefire talks.

But Katz doesn't see Putin making any commitments quickly.

If Putin doesn't eventually agree to a ceasefire, then Trump will have to decide if he wants to increase the pressure on Russia via more sanctions or with more support for Ukraine.

Katz said more sanctions aren't likely to change Russia's behavior.

And he said Trump probably doesn't want to increase support for Ukraine.

Katz said Putin might try to jam Trump into that tough decision.

“Putin might see it as a way to call Trump's bluff,” Katz said.

Or, Katz said, Putin might try and put Ukraine in a hard position between agreeing to a Russia-favoring deal or risk further damaging its relations with Trump.

Katz said that's a classic Russian “divide your opponents from each other strategy.”","{'href': 'https://katv.com', 'title': 'KATV'}"

Yemeni Houthis have twice attempted to attack the USS Harry S. Truman after at least 53 people have been killed and 98 injured after the U.S. launched a series of airstrikes on Yemen on Saturday, according to the Houthi health ministry.

A U.S. defense official told NBC News on Monday that the militia had launched two retaliatory attacks against the USS Harry S. Truman that had both been unsuccessful. 

The Houthis claimed to have attacked the U.S. aircraft carrier — the vessel is stationed in the Red Sea — in December and January, and the Yemeni Houthi Armed Forces said in a statement posted on Telegram on Monday that “we are confronting this criminal aggression and responding to escalation with escalation.”

A rebel spokesperson had told NBC News on Sunday that the group would respond with “more escalation,” after President Donald Trump said he ordered the airstrikes on Houthi-held areas of Yemen on Saturday and promised “overwhelming lethal force” until the group ceased attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

The Houthis, an Iran-backed militia that has taken over part of Yemen, including its capital, Sanaa, began launching missiles and drones and pursuing other attacks against shipping vessels in response to the war in Gaza.

The group reported explosions Saturday evening in Sanaa and Saada, the Houthi stronghold near the Saudi border.

Footage broadcast on Yemeni TV and published by The Associated Press showed vast destruction, with people searching for survivors as a bulldozer shifted rubble and ambulances arrived at the scene of the wreckage.

Photos showed black smoke rising over Sanaa's airport complex, which includes a military facility. Strikes were also reported in Hodeida, Bayda and Marib.

The attack came a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel's latest blockade on Gaza, which has halted the flow of aid into the enclave. There have been no reported attacks since this threat was made.

Nasr el-Din Amer, a spokesperson for the Houthis, told NBC News on Sunday that most of the casualties from the airstrikes were women and children, which NBC News has not independently verified.

Amer said the Houthis would continue their operations “until the blockade on Gaza is lifted.”

“We will respond to the recent escalation with further escalation,” he said. “Our response will not be delayed.”

Trump also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group and promised hold the country “fully accountable” for the actions of its proxy Houthi group. Tehran supports the Houthis with money, training and equipment.

In a statement to Iranian state media, Hossein Salami, the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, said Iran would “respond decisively and destructively” to any enemy taking threats into action.

But Salami also distanced Iran from the Houthis, emphasizing that the group made its strategic decisions independently.

“The Islamic Republic of Iran plays no role in shaping the national or operational policies of any resistance front group,” he said, in remarks that could be interpreted as a signal that the Houthis are on their own.

An annual $1 trillion flow of goods passes through the Red Sea.

The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of Israel's war in Gaza in late 2023 and January of this year, when the current ceasefire took effect.

Some shippers responded to the attacks late last year by suspending service in the region.

Earlier this month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio redesignated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. The designation had been revoked by Joe Biden's Democratic administration over concerns it would badly affect the delivery of aid to Yemen, which was considered to be facing one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.

Vladimir Putin could ask for more concessions from Ukraine before he signs a ceasefire agreement, Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia, tells Sky News.

So far Donald Trump has given Russia ""all concessions"", including saying Ukraine needs to give up territory, can't become a NATO member and there will be no US peacekeepers.

In return ""it's been all sticks"" for Ukraine, he says, including cutting off military assistance and intelligence.

""Now the ball's in Putin's court and I wouldn't be surprised if he signed it because he's gotten so much in return already,"" he says.

As ambassador to Russia McFaul says he negotiated with the Putin administration and ""I can tell you that you don't just give them everything in the beginning and then hope for goodwill back.

""It doesn't work that way with these guys. They pocket your concessions and ask for more.""

He adds: ""I worry Putin has hinted that now he's pocketed the earlier concessions, he wants more things.""

He says Trump is ""not interested in the deals of any long-term negotiation"" and just wants to get a temporary ceasefire so he can declare victory.

On the other hand, from the Ukrainian perspective, ""a ceasefire is just a baby step towards what they want to be a more long-term security settlement"".

Asked what will happen in the next few weeks, McFaul says he thinks ""Putin is going to take one more run at some more demands.""

""He's going to test the waters for that, and then he'll probably sign an agreement. But it'll be a very temporary agreement, just 30 days. I hope it launches a peace settlement because the Ukrainian people deserve peace. But I'm not optimistic about the long-term peace and stability under these current terms.""

One detail White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed in the news conference earlier was that Donald Trump will discuss a power plant on the border of Ukraine and Russia with Vladimir Putin tomorrow.

Leavitt did not give any details about which power plant she was referring to, but her comments may have been a reference to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the largest nuclear plant in Europe.

Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of risking an accident at the plant with their actions.

For context: The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has six units with a one gigawatt capacity each.

It was occupied by Russian troops in early March 2022 and shut down in September that year due to battles near the plant.

Ukraine's state-owned firm Energoatom has said it does not know the state of the equipment and warned the Russian occupation could result in a serious disaster.

It said because of that it would take up to a year to restart operations at the plant.

Ukraine and Russia ""have never been closer to peace"" and ""we are on the 10th-yard line"" according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, but our US correspondent James Matthews says, to extend the American football analogy, ""the question is who's carrying the ball?""

""There is a strong argument to say that's Vladimir Putin right now,"" he adds.

""She was asked about this business of Donald Trump talking about detail, things to be negotiated,"" he says.

""She was asked: 'Has Donald Trump been speaking to the Ukrainians about that fine detail?'

""She seemed to indicate there had been discussions about that. That would be a surprise I think. The Ukrainians want to get to a starting point, which is a ceasefire, and thereafter get into detailed negotiations.

""So we'll see how that comes out in the wash tomorrow.""

We've been listening to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt's news conference, where she was asked about ceasefire negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.

She says ""we are on the 10th-yard line of peace and we've never been closer to a peace deal than we are in this moment"".

""The president is determined to get one done,"" she adds.

Asked if Donald Trump would consider putting sanctions on Russia if his phone call with Vladimir Putin doesn't go well tomorrow, Leavitt replies: ""It's something the president has floated, and certainly he's willing to do if necessary.""

Leavitt also sidesteps a question on whether Volodymyr Zelenskyy has given Trump authority to divide up Ukrainian assets with Putin.

She says it has been part of the discussion between the US president and his Ukrainian counterpart, but adds further details will come after Trump's call with Putin tomorrow.

She also declines to answer a question on whether Trump and Putin will discuss Zelenskyy's future.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy was asked further questions about the war in Ukraine by the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, after he delivered a statement to the House of Commons on the G7 meeting in Canada last week.

He says the pause in US intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine ""has not had a material effect"" because it was only for a short period.

Discussing the ceasefire proposal, Lammy says the UK is prepared to consider putting British troops on the ground, ""but there must be a US backstop"".

""At stake is not only the future of Ukraine but the collective security of our continent and therefore Britain's direct national interest,"" he says.

The foreign secretary also says Russia must ""pay for the damage it is causing"" in Ukraine, and there will be a discussion on ""moving from freezing to seizing"" Russian assets.

Here's a look at what Foreign Secretary David Lammy said about the Ukraine war during his statement to the House of Commons about last week's G7 meeting in Canada.

Lammy says Vladimir Putin must prove he is serious about peace by agreeing a ""full and unconditional ceasefire now"".

He says the G7 countries are ""united"" in supporting Ukraine and its pursuit of peace.

He says: ""Now it is Putin who stands in the spotlight, Putin who must answer, Putin who must choose - are you serious, Mr Putin about peace?

""Will you stop the fighting or will you drag your feet and play games, pay lip service to the ceasefire whilst still pummelling Ukraine? My warning to Mr Putin is this: if you are serious, prove it with a full and unconditional ceasefire now.

""And if Putin does not deliver, and I must tell the House that I currently see no sign yet that he is, the G7 meeting helped us ready the tools to get Russia to negotiate seriously.

""We're not waiting for the Kremlin. If they reject a ceasefire, we have more cards that we can play.""

Foreign Secretary David Lammy has just given a statement in the House of Commons on last week's G7 meeting in Canada.

You can watch his speech here:

Three children have been injured by Russian shelling in the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, the head of the Donetsk regional administration has said.

Vadym Filashkin said the injured included two girls aged eight and 15 and one boy aged 12.

All three are receiving medical care, he added.

He said the children had ""already been evacuated to a safer region, but their parents made a crazy decision to return to Pokrovsk"".

He added: ""Adults forcing their children to sit under fire in frontline cities are provoking outrage.

""If you don't take care of yourself, then at least take care of the children! Don't wait for a shell or bomb to arrive at your house! Evacuate!""

Earlier, military analyst Michael Clarke explained how Russia could divert troops to the battle for Pokrovsk after gaining the upper hand in the battle for Kursk (see our 13.50 post).

These pictures show Ukrainian servicemen firing a 120mm mortar towards Russian troops on the frontline near the city of Chasiv Yar in eastern Ukraine.

For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.

A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.

“I think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,” said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. “But they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.”

When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it's being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.

Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.

The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.



Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn't make up for the emissions of the cattle.

Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions “without concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,” like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.

The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.

Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper “helps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,” she said.

Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.

It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is “second to none” when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.

“I have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,"" Eshel said.

For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, ""don't make beef a habit.""

The Trump administration has transferred hundreds of immigrants to El Salvador even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations under an 18th century wartime declaration targeting Venezuelan gang members, officials said Sunday. Flights were in the air at the time of the ruling.

U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg issued an order Saturday temporarily blocking the deportations, but lawyers told him there were already two planes with immigrants in the air — one headed for El Salvador, the other for Honduras. Boasberg verbally ordered the planes be turned around, but they apparently were not and he did not include the directive in his written order.

Boasberg scheduled a 4 p.m. ET hearing on Monday and said the government should be prepared to answer a series of questions about the flights laid out in the motion from plaintiffs, which include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the nonprofit group Democracy Forward.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement Sunday, responded to speculation about whether the administration was flouting court orders: ""The administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order. The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory.""

The acronym refers to the Tren de Aragua gang, which Trump targeted in his unusual proclamation that was released Saturday

In a court filing Sunday, the Department of Justice, which has appealed Boasberg's decision, said it would not use the Trump proclamation he blocked for further deportations if his decision is not overturned.

Trump's allies were gleeful over the results.

""Oopsie — Too late,"" Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who agreed to house about 300 immigrants for a year at a cost of $6 million US in his country's prisons, wrote on the social media site X above an article about Boasberg's ruling. That post was recirculated by White House communications director Steven Cheung.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who negotiated an earlier deal with Bukele to house immigrants, posted on the site: ""We sent over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars.""

The deportees were taken to the notorious CECOT facility, the centrepiece of Bukele's push to pacify his once violence-wracked country through tough police measures and limits on basic rights.

Trump moves quickly on immigration raids, arrests

The immigrants were deported after Trump's declaration of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which has been used only three times in U.S. history.

The law, invoked during the War of 1812 and World Wars I and II, requires a president to declare the United States is at war, giving him extraordinary powers to detain or remove foreigners who otherwise would have protections under immigration or criminal laws. It was last used to justify the detention of Japanese-American civilians during World War II.

Venezuela's government in a statement Sunday rejected the use of Trump's declaration of the law, characterizing it as evocative of ""the darkest episodes in human history, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps.""

Tren de Aragua originated in an infamously lawless prison in the central state of Aragua and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone during the past decade. Trump seized on the gang during his campaign to paint misleading pictures of communities that he contended were ""taken over"" by what were actually a handful of lawbreakers.

The Trump administration has not identified the immigrants deported, provided any evidence they are in fact members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crimes in the United States. It also sent two top members of the Salvadoran MS-13 gang to El Salvador who had been arrested in the United States.

Boasberg noted that the Alien Enemies Act has never before been used outside of a congressionally declared war and that plaintiffs may successfully argue Trump exceeded his legal authority in invoking it.

The bar on deportations stands for up to 14 days and the immigrants will remain in federal custody during that time. Boasberg has scheduled a hearing Friday to hear additional arguments in the case.

He said he had to act because the immigrants whose deportations may actually violate the U.S. Constitution deserved a chance to have their pleas heard in court.

""Once they're out of the country,"" Boasberg said, ""there's little I could do.""

Concerns have also been raised in other cases about whether the Trump administration is complying with court rulings.

Dr. Rasha Alawieh, 34, who is an assistant professor at Brown University's medical school in Providence, R.I., has been deported to Lebanon even though a judge had issued an order blocking the U.S. visa holder's immediate removal from the country, according to court papers.

U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, said he had received a ""detailed and specific"" timeline of the events from a lawyer working on Alawieh's behalf that raised ""serious allegations"" about whether his order was violated.

Despite the judge's order, according to the cousin's lawyers, Alawieh was flown to Paris, where she was then set to board a flight for Lebanon that had been scheduled for Sunday.

Alawieh, a Lebanese citizen who lives in Providence, R.I., was detained on Thursday after arriving at Logan International Airport in Boston after travelling to Lebanon to see relatives, according to a lawsuit filed by her cousin, Yara Chehab.

Alawieh has held visas to be in the United States since 2018, when she first came to complete a two-year fellowship at Ohio State University before then completing a fellowship at the University of Washington and then moving to the Yale-Waterbury Internal Medicine Program, which she completed in June.

Lawyers for the government explained in a court filing Monday that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at Logan did not receive notice of the order until she ""had already departed the United States,"" the judge noted. They asked that the petition be dismissed.

Sorokin put a hearing on her case on hold to give Alawieh's new lawyers time to prepare.

Hamas continues to expand its vast underground tunnel network in Gaza, a released Israeli hostage has revealed. Tal Shoham, who was held captive for 505 days, told Fox News that Hamas operatives would dig constantly, adding they never stopped, ""not for a single day.""

The network, named the ""Gaza metro"" by the Israeli military, is estimated to be around 560 - 720 km long, with approximately 5,700 separate shafts leading down to the tunnels. It is believed to stretch across the Gaza Strip, with tunnels connecting various areas, including military bases, logistics centres, and residential neighbourhoods.

The tunnels are dug by hand, using simple tools, and are often reinforced with concrete and iron. The network is designed to provide Hamas militants with safe passage, allowing them to move undetected.

Mr Shoham was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7, 2023. His wife and young children, aged four and eight, were also taken that day, though he was unaware of their fate at the time. Hoping to protect them, he stepped outside to surrender, only to be surrounded by around 40 armed men.

Driven into Gaza in a car trunk, he was ordered to kneel but refused, telling his captors, ""If you want to kill me, kill me, but you will not execute me like ISIS."" He was then paraded through Gaza's streets.

For 50 days, Mr Shoham didn't know if his wife and children were alive. To cope, he imagined their funeral, eulogising them in his mind. ""I sobbed but never let my captors see me cry,"" he told Fox News. On the 50th day, he received a letter confirming their survival and release, shifting his focus to his survival.

Mr Shoham was held in isolation before being moved in with other hostages. Eventually, he and three others were transferred to an underground tunnel, where he would remain until his release.

He described the dire conditions inside the tunnel, surviving on just 300 millilitres of water daily - for both drinking and washing - and plain rice. The lack of nutrition left him severely weak.

Months into captivity, as his health deteriorated, a doctor was finally brought in. By then, he had developed a severe infection and internal bleeding in his legs, turning them blue, yellow, and purple. The doctor provided blood thinners and a week's worth of vitamin supplements.

""It tasted like dog food, but it dramatically improved our condition,"" Mr Shoham recalled.

Despite the supplements, he was severely underweight upon his release from Gaza. Tal Shoham and another hostage, Omer Wenkert, were released on February 22.

As of now, 58 of the 251 people abducted by Hamas on October 7, 2023, remain in captivity. The Israeli military has targeted the tunnel network, using air strikes, artillery bombardment, and ground forces to destroy the tunnels and disrupt Hamas's operations. Despite these efforts, the tunnel network remains in a ""good functional state,"" with many areas repaired.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The passports of multiple employees of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek have been confiscated, preventing them from travelling outside the country, according to a new report. The government has reportedly tightened regulations on the company to prevent sensitive information from being leaked and key employees from deserting it.

DeepSeek's parent company, High-Flyer, a hedge fund, is holding onto the passports of key employees - especially those in research and development - to ensure they cannot leave the country without approval, The Information reported.

The report further claimed that the Chinese government now plays a direct role in deciding who can invest in DeepSeek, which gained global attention in January with the launch and meteoric rise of its open-source ""reasoning"" model, R1.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's administration has even labelled DeepSeek a ""national treasure"".

DeepSeek's AI technology has faced scrutiny for following China's censorship rules. Earlier, The Guardian reported that DeepSeek's chatbot avoids discussing sensitive political topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre, the Hong Kong Umbrella Revolution, and other government-sensitive issues.

The restrictions come amid heightened AI competition between China and the US. Reports suggest that Beijing recently advised AI researchers and business leaders to avoid travelling to the US due to concerns about trade secret leaks.

Kylie Robison, a senior AI reporter at The Verge, cited three unnamed sources who claimed the purpose of these travel bans was to prevent the disclosure of confidential data, including trade or even state secrets.

Founded in May 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, DeepSeek quickly became a significant player in the AI industry. The company first entered the AI space with DeepSeek Coder in November 2023, followed by DeepSeek LLM and DeepSeek V-2 in May 2024. Its most recent models, R1 and V-3, have drawn global attention for their impressive capabilities at a surprisingly low cost.

DeepSeek's AI model, DeepSeek-V3, reportedly costed under $6 million (Rs 51 crore) to develop - significantly less than what US tech giants like Microsoft and OpenAI spend. According to its creators, DeepSeek-V3 ""tops the leaderboard among open-source models"" and rivals leading closed-source AI models in math, coding, and natural language reasoning.

India's finance ministry recently warned employees against using AI tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek on government devices, citing risks to official data privacy. The US has also imposed export bans on high-end Nvidia A100 chips, limiting DeepSeek's access to critical hardware. The European Union is also considering tighter regulations on foreign AI applications to safeguard national security and user data.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Lithuanian prosecutors on Monday blamed the Russian military intelligence service for being behind the arson attack on an Ikea store in Vilnius last year, calling it ""an act of terrorism"".

Lithuania, a Baltic state and NATO member, has been a staunch ally of Kyiv since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and frequently warned against sabotage attempts inspired by Russia.

On Monday, Lithuanian prosecutor general's office attributed the arson attack at Vilnius's Ikea furniture store to Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU.

""We regard this act as an act of terrorism with serious consequences,"" prosecutor Arturas Urbelis told reporters.

The Ikea store was set ablaze in Vilnius in May 2024. The fire caused no casualties.

The prosecutors said two Ukrainian citizens were suspects in the Ikea arson case -- with one being detained in Lithuania and the other in Poland.

""It has been established that through a series of intermediaries... the organisers of these crimes are in Russia and this is connected to military intelligence and security forces,"" Urbelis said.

Prosecutor's office said that the person detained in Lithuania is suspected of having entered Poland in spring 2024.

""During a secret meeting in Warsaw, he and another person agreed to set fire to and blow up shopping centres in Lithuania and Latvia for a reward of 10,000 euros,"" the office said in a statement.

""More than one supermarket has been set on fire, and not just supermarkets,"" Urbelis said when asked about whether the arson was linked to similar cases in neighbouring Poland.

""It is obvious that the persons we have identified, the perpetrators and the intermediaries, are also linked to the criminal acts committed in Poland,"" he added.

Commenting on the findings, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said it was ""exceptionally perfidious"" for Russia to hire Ukrainians as perpetrators of sabotage acts.

""Dear allies, the investigation of the Lithuanian prosecutor's office has confirmed our suspicions that responsible for setting fires to shopping centres in Vilnius and Warsaw are the Russian secret services,"" he said on X.

""Good to know before negotiations. Such is the nature of this state,"" he added, referring to potential talks on war-torn Ukraine's fate.

THE WEST LOOP in Chicago was once the city's meatpacking district. That is long gone, but the neighbourhood is still a place where people come from miles around to buy beef. At Au Cheval, a fancy burger joint where tourists queue up for hours, the signature dish is a double cheeseburger served with a fried egg. It is reputed, at least among Chicagoans, to be the best burger in the world. Yet the price of such a delight is rising. It is not only that eggs now sell for $6 a dozen, thanks to bird flu. More quietly, beef has been rising in price for years now too. And thanks to Donald Trump's proposed tariffs, it may be about to get much worse.

Since January 2020 the average price of a pound of beef mince has risen from $3.90 to $5.60, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. That is a 45% increase, almost double the general rate of inflation. The price rise is the result of high demand combined with tight supply, according to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a lobby group for the industry. Thanks to underinvestment a decade ago America's cattle herd is smaller than in the past, but Americans still love their burgers and steaks. There is now a national beef shortfall.

Thankfully, imports have saved the day. As recently as 2022 America was a net exporter of beef. That has now reversed. Last year imports totalled 2m head of live cattle and 4.6bn pounds (2.1bn kg) of the dead variety–a record high. That has stopped prices rising further. Yet Mr Trump seems more worried about foreign herds crossing the border than he is about inflation. On March 3rd, on his social-media platform, Truth Social, the president staked out a new position. On April 2nd he will be imposing hefty new tariffs on agricultural imports. That will probably include beef. Farmers, he said, should “get ready” to grow food to sell to Americans, and “have fun”.

One might think cattlemen at least would be delighted. Unlike say, soyabean farmers, who largely export their crop and so will get hit by reciprocal tariffs, they are at a medium-rare advantage: Americans are already buyers, and a squeeze on imports will merely push up the price. “You could make the argument…it is actually going to help the domestic market,” says Steve Sonderman, a rancher in north-east Nebraska. The problem, he goes on to explain, is that ranching is more complicated than that. “We're trying to be in a rebuilding phase for the herd,” he says. A sudden price spike would encourage farmers to sell down their stocks rather than invest. Meanwhile, consumers might learn to like alternatives to red meat. “So it'd be a great thing for price, but probably a horrible thing for the industry,” he says.

Even if the proposed agricultural tariffs do not go into effect, a now partially suspended separate 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico may be reimposed. Just like an engine part, a cow may cross many borders before it is finally eaten. Of America's imported cows, a large share are calves raised in Mexico then brought to America to fatten. Once fattened, many then go to Canadian slaughterhouses, with the product subsequently reimported. That may all be disrupted too. Mr Trump famously likes to eat his steaks well done. With these tariffs he may be the one who gets burnt.

 LONDON - A ""significant number"" of countries are willing to provide peacekeeping troops in Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday. 

 Britain and France have spearheaded efforts to offer a peacekeeping plan for Ukraine after U.S. President Donald Trump began talks to press for a peace deal with Russia. 

 More than 30 countries are expected to be involved in the so-called 'coalition of the willing' to support Ukraine, Starmer's spokesperson told reporters. 

 ""The contribution capabilities will vary, but this will be a significant force, with a significant number of countries providing troops."" 

 Russia has repeatedly rejected the idea of soldiers from countries belonging to the NATO military alliance being stationed in Ukraine. 

 Asked if the peacekeeping troops would be allowed to fire back if targeted, the spokesperson said military planning meetings were taking place to go through the details. 

 Starmer hosted a virtual meeting on Saturday with leaders from Europe and other countries to build support for the coalition before military planners are due to meet in Britain on Thursday to discuss how a truce could be guaranteed. 

 Asked about Russian comments that Moscow would not accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine, Starmer's spokesperson said: ""It is worth remembering that Russia didn't ask Ukraine when it deployed North Korean troops to the frontline last year."" 

 Britain and France are both continuing to push the United States for security guarantees to deter any future Russian attacks.

At Veterans Affairs facilities in Detroit and Denver, staff reductions have led to canceled health programs and left homeless veterans without their dedicated coordinator to help them find an apartment and line up a deposit.

 In Alabama, job cuts at the Education Department have slowed efforts to get disabled children access to classrooms.  And in California, Yosemite National Park paused new reservations for more than 500 campsites during peak summer months because of staffing uncertainty.  An unprecedented effort to  rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-seeks-deeper-cuts-to-federal-workforce-081d7d5a"" target=""_blank"" class=""manualbacklink"">shrink the federal labor force is impeding work at government sites across the country and spawning unintended consequences for services Americans rely on.  The U.S. government is America's largest employer, with 2.4 million civilian workers as of January, excluding the postal service. The Trump administration has started cutting tens of thousands of jobs through a plan encouraged by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency that aims to reduce the size of government by $1 trillion this fiscal year, roughly 15% of last year's spending. The goal is to cull a workforce that President Trump has said includes many people who aren't doing their jobs. Oxford Economics, a data provider and consulting firm, estimates there will be 200,000 fewer federal workers by the end of 2025. In the private sector, employment attorneys say, major companies can spend months analyzing workers' job performance, position and skills before making big cuts. They enlist senior leaders to recommend which workers to keep, pore over union rules and smooth the process of applying for unemployment benefits for fired workers. Such forethought is key to ensuring the employees who remain can still get the work done, they say. The Trump administration has adhered to few of those norms so far. Managers say essential staff have been cut, and that the administration hasn't followed detailed rules on how to enact widespread layoffs. Government agencies have granted voluntary buyouts to tens of thousands of people, fired probationary workers—a term for those who were hired or promoted in the past year or two—and are planning for deep reductions in the next few months. So far, many cuts haven't taken into account workers' performance or the necessity of their roles. Two judges on Thursday blocked the firings of probationary workers at agencies including the departments of Agriculture, Energy and Veterans Affairs. Probationary workers have fewer protections against layoffs. Still, the firings need to go through the proper legal avenues, said U.S. District Judge William Alsup in California. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration will immediately fight Alsup's order. While some probationary employees are expected to return to their jobs as a result of the rulings, their ability to retain those jobs remains uncertain given the continuing legal fight and plans for deeper agency cuts. Supporters of the overhaul say the government's workforce was due for reinvention, with the last major effort taking place under President Clinton. Republicans have criticized agencies for allowing federal employees to work remotely well past the pandemic, a practice they say has made them less accountable. Trump has ordered workers to return to the office. Trump in the Oval Office told reporters this month that he wanted to terminate “the people that aren't working, that aren't showing up and have a lot of problems.” He said the government was experiencing “bloat like nobody's ever seen before.” In interviews, more than 60 current and former federal workers said the wide slashing has worsened services Americans receive and hindered remaining staff working on areas like improving healthcare and lowering energy bills. It also has discouraged top talent from working for the federal government. From schools to campsitesStaff cuts have reduced or slowed services for health, education and even operations like weather forecasting. After facing years of bipartisan criticism from Congress, the Department of Health and Human Services late last year hired a transplant surgeon to help implement fixes to the system that regulates organ transplants. Dr. Jayme Locke, who left her post at the University of Alabama Birmingham for the federal job, was recently fired as a probationary worker. Transplant experts had hoped she would preside over a new era of making improvements instead of just studying them. Dr. Locke declined to comment. HHS didn't respond to a request for comment. Weather balloons, which capture information on temperature, humidity and wind, aren't going up regularly in Albany, N.Y., or Gray, Maine, and launches have stopped altogether in Kotzebue, Alaska, due to staffing shortages at the National Weather Service. National Parks and other federal lands are cutting hours at visitor centers. More than 700 Park Service employees took the government's resignation offer, according to an email to supervisors seen by The Wall Street Journal. Roughly 1,000 probationary employees were fired, according to the National Parks Conservation Association, a nonprofit advocacy group. A spokeswoman for the Department of the Interior declined to comment on personnel numbers, adding that the agency is improving fiscal responsibility and efficiency. Yosemite will begin taking summer reservations for some campground sites next week. More may become available if operational capacity allows, according to a Friday post from an official park account. People familiar with the delay attributed it to staffing uncertainty. The spokeswoman said the park expects to share more details about reservations later this year. Oregon's Yaquina Head, a Bureau of Land Management shoreline area, cut hours, halted lighthouse tours and may see closures at the black-stoned Cobble Beach after losing three of seven members of its permanent staff, said Sabrina Gorney, one of the laid-off probationary workers. “Visitors are going to find that their services are really limited,” said Gorney, 24, who had worked at Yaquina Head as a seasonal employee and in August was promoted to a permanent role making $21.50 per hour. Gorney's termination letter, viewed by the Journal, said her abilities didn't meet the department's needs. She received three performance awards in less than a year. Victoria DeLano, 52, worked as an equal-opportunity specialist for the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights. Based in Birmingham, Ala., she processed discrimination allegations against Southeast U.S. schools. About a month after she was fired, OCR offices in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas and New York were eliminated as the Education Department cut about half of its workforce. Complaints have piled up, slowing efforts to ensure school access for disabled children in an office where staff were already overworked, she said. “A child is not able to go to school right now until something is in place,” said DeLano, who has advocated against the cuts through her union, the American Federation of Government Employees. OCR plans to use more mediation and a faster case-processing approach to address disability-related complaints and other harassment complaints, a spokesperson said. “The dedicated staff of OCR will deliver on its statutory responsibilities,” said Madi Biedermann, the department's deputy assistant secretary for communications. Some offices have tried to hire back the fired workers. In March the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency, paused the terminations of about 5,900 probationary workers in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The agency said it would bring back those employees with back pay. Visitors walk near Yaquina Head lighthouse in Newport, Ore. Jeffrey Grant, deputy director for operations at an entity within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said 29 of his 82 fired employees were rehired—20 because of their specific responsibilities, the rest because they weren't actually probationary. Some laid-off members of his team, he said, worked on improving the process of how Americans enrolled in insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act. He retired in anticipation of mass terminations and later wrote to HHS's acting chief human capital officer that “every one of these people had the ability, knowledge and skills that we require to accomplish our work.” Not ‘safe'In many parts of the country, the Trump administration's job cuts have hit services and constituencies that Trump pledged to protect. Chief among them is the Department of Veterans Affairs, which plans to cut about 70,000 positions and has already laid off thousands. The agency employs about 470,000 people. Fewer VA staff are handling veterans' claims that will get them treatment for military-service injuries and mental health conditions, two current employees said. This has already resulted in veterans waiting longer to get treatment in North Texas, one said. Fifteen homeless veterans getting services at a VA community resource center in Denver are now without their assigned housing advocate, Brett Taylor, who was laid off from his role finding apartments for clients and making sure they had deposits. Remaining staff, he said, are overworked already. “You would think it would make sense to add more providers, add more people, to make sure the veterans were taken care of,” said Taylor, a 37-year-old Army veteran who served in Iraq. One VA hospital in Detroit canceled programs meant to improve patients' stability and range of motion after the firings of probationary workers, including Kara Oliver, a 33-year-old Navy veteran leading classes and monitoring participants' health and progress. Brett Taylor, who worked for the VA in Denver helping homeless vets find apartments, was recently laid off.Oliver, whose salary was about $48,650, realized she was laid off when she went into the office on Feb. 25 and couldn't access her computer. She said she didn't receive her termination letter—useful for filing for unemployment benefits—until March 5. “I want to be there for my veterans,” she said. But the instability of federal work is making her unsure if she would take a federal job in the future. “It just doesn't feel safe.” VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said the agency has laid off 2,400 probationary employees in positions including publicists, interior designers and diversity, equity and inclusion officers. The positions amounted to half of one percent of the VA's workforce, he added. “The notion that these layoffs are causing issues across the department is false,” he said. Performance reviewsSince Trump's inauguration, the administration has gutted entire agencies, teams and categories of employees, only to add some back later. Early targets were the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Officials have tried to wind down the divisions' work and lay off many staff. The CFPB, created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, investigates complaints from Americans who say their banks charged them improper fees or falsely advertised interest rates. Matthew Pfaff, chief of staff of the CFPB's Office of Consumer Response, said in a court hearing that more than 16,000 complaints—unprecedented in his memory—piled up when the division was ordered to stop work for weeks. Layoffs also cut into the work. Among the fired CFPB workers was Milo Chang, 22, who joined the CFPB in June through a program that recruited college graduates to the public sector who may have otherwise sought lucrative jobs in consulting, technology or finance. His team last year analyzed complaints from Missouri to Texas from Americans pressured to refinance their mortgages at higher interest rates after a divorce or the death of a spouse. He learned Sunday he would be rehired due to one of the Thursday rulings but said his future employment remains unclear. Milo Chang, 22, pictured a week before being laid off, has been told he will be rehired.Other agencies have cut probationary employees for performance reasons, without reviewing their performance. Traci DiMartini, a human capital officer for the Internal Revenue Service, said in a court declaration that it would have taken weeks or months to evaluate 6,700 probationary workers' performance. That didn't happen: “This fact was discussed openly in meetings,” she said. She refused to sign the termination notices and was put on administrative leave pending termination, in part because she was “insubordinate and uncooperative with the DOGE employees,” according to her declaration.

He said he's not opposed to downsizing the government but is against the indiscriminate manner in which the cuts are being made. “Is it mission critical in the sense of police, fire, border security?” he said of the work he was doing. “No, but it's essential to provide fiscal accountability and responsibility, which is what DOGE is about.” Deeper cutsDeeper cuts are expected in the coming months as agencies begin the next phase of the downsizing: a so-called reduction-in-force process that is a highly regulated exercise used infrequently in government. Agencies were told they had until last Thursday to outline how many positions would be cut through attrition, layoffs, a Trump-ordered hiring freeze and the proposed elimination of agencies' functions. One former senior government official described the process like baking a cake with 20-step directions and that leaders must read the rules countless times. Workers' tenure, veterans status and performance must be taken into account during layoffs. The Office of Personnel Management on Wednesday told agencies that collective-bargaining agreement provisions that “excessively interfere with management's rights” to lay off employees aren't enforceable. It urged agencies not to respond to every request for information from unions. In a recent round of cuts, officials at the Energy Department could submit just 200 characters to justify positions, according to two people with knowledge of the process. In February, teams identified probationary workers who were critical to public safety, the environment and health, or other mission-critical areas, a former official said. Still, ultimately some fired probationary staff were essential to nuclear facilities, that person said. Though some were reinstated, the agency will now lean more on contractors.

In Alabama, job cuts at the Education Department have slowed efforts to get disabled children access to classrooms.

 And in California, Yosemite National Park paused new reservations for more than 500 campsites during peak summer months because of staffing uncertainty.  An unprecedented effort to  rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-seeks-deeper-cuts-to-federal-workforce-081d7d5a"" target=""_blank"" class=""manualbacklink"">shrink the federal labor force is impeding work at government sites across the country and spawning unintended consequences for services Americans rely on.  The U.S. government is America's largest employer, with 2.4 million civilian workers as of January, excluding the postal service. The Trump administration has started cutting tens of thousands of jobs through a plan encouraged by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency that aims to reduce the size of government by $1 trillion this fiscal year, roughly 15% of last year's spending. The goal is to cull a workforce that President Trump has said includes many people who aren't doing their jobs. Oxford Economics, a data provider and consulting firm, estimates there will be 200,000 fewer federal workers by the end of 2025. In the private sector, employment attorneys say, major companies can spend months analyzing workers' job performance, position and skills before making big cuts. They enlist senior leaders to recommend which workers to keep, pore over union rules and smooth the process of applying for unemployment benefits for fired workers. Such forethought is key to ensuring the employees who remain can still get the work done, they say. The Trump administration has adhered to few of those norms so far. Managers say essential staff have been cut, and that the administration hasn't followed detailed rules on how to enact widespread layoffs. Government agencies have granted voluntary buyouts to tens of thousands of people, fired probationary workers—a term for those who were hired or promoted in the past year or two—and are planning for deep reductions in the next few months. So far, many cuts haven't taken into account workers' performance or the necessity of their roles. Two judges on Thursday blocked the firings of probationary workers at agencies including the departments of Agriculture, Energy and Veterans Affairs. Probationary workers have fewer protections against layoffs. Still, the firings need to go through the proper legal avenues, said U.S. District Judge William Alsup in California. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration will immediately fight Alsup's order. While some probationary employees are expected to return to their jobs as a result of the rulings, their ability to retain those jobs remains uncertain given the continuing legal fight and plans for deeper agency cuts. Supporters of the overhaul say the government's workforce was due for reinvention, with the last major effort taking place under President Clinton. Republicans have criticized agencies for allowing federal employees to work remotely well past the pandemic, a practice they say has made them less accountable. Trump has ordered workers to return to the office. Trump in the Oval Office told reporters this month that he wanted to terminate “the people that aren't working, that aren't showing up and have a lot of problems.” He said the government was experiencing “bloat like nobody's ever seen before.” In interviews, more than 60 current and former federal workers said the wide slashing has worsened services Americans receive and hindered remaining staff working on areas like improving healthcare and lowering energy bills. It also has discouraged top talent from working for the federal government. From schools to campsitesStaff cuts have reduced or slowed services for health, education and even operations like weather forecasting. After facing years of bipartisan criticism from Congress, the Department of Health and Human Services late last year hired a transplant surgeon to help implement fixes to the system that regulates organ transplants. Dr. Jayme Locke, who left her post at the University of Alabama Birmingham for the federal job, was recently fired as a probationary worker. Transplant experts had hoped she would preside over a new era of making improvements instead of just studying them. Dr. Locke declined to comment. HHS didn't respond to a request for comment. Weather balloons, which capture information on temperature, humidity and wind, aren't going up regularly in Albany, N.Y., or Gray, Maine, and launches have stopped altogether in Kotzebue, Alaska, due to staffing shortages at the National Weather Service. National Parks and other federal lands are cutting hours at visitor centers. More than 700 Park Service employees took the government's resignation offer, according to an email to supervisors seen by The Wall Street Journal. Roughly 1,000 probationary employees were fired, according to the National Parks Conservation Association, a nonprofit advocacy group. A spokeswoman for the Department of the Interior declined to comment on personnel numbers, adding that the agency is improving fiscal responsibility and efficiency. Yosemite will begin taking summer reservations for some campground sites next week. More may become available if operational capacity allows, according to a Friday post from an official park account. People familiar with the delay attributed it to staffing uncertainty. The spokeswoman said the park expects to share more details about reservations later this year.

An unprecedented effort to  rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-administration-seeks-deeper-cuts-to-federal-workforce-081d7d5a"" target=""_blank"" class=""manualbacklink"">shrink the federal labor force is impeding work at government sites across the country and spawning unintended consequences for services Americans rely on.

The U.S. government is America's largest employer, with 2.4 million civilian workers as of January, excluding the postal service. The Trump administration has started cutting tens of thousands of jobs through a plan encouraged by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency that aims to reduce the size of government by $1 trillion this fiscal year, roughly 15% of last year's spending. The goal is to cull a workforce that President Trump has said includes many people who aren't doing their jobs. Oxford Economics, a data provider and consulting firm, estimates there will be 200,000 fewer federal workers by the end of 2025.

In the private sector, employment attorneys say, major companies can spend months analyzing workers' job performance, position and skills before making big cuts. They enlist senior leaders to recommend which workers to keep, pore over union rules and smooth the process of applying for unemployment benefits for fired workers. Such forethought is key to ensuring the employees who remain can still get the work done, they say.

The Trump administration has adhered to few of those norms so far.

Managers say essential staff have been cut, and that the administration hasn't followed detailed rules on how to enact widespread layoffs. Government agencies have granted voluntary buyouts to tens of thousands of people, fired probationary workers—a term for those who were hired or promoted in the past year or two—and are planning for deep reductions in the next few months. So far, many cuts haven't taken into account workers' performance or the necessity of their roles.

Two judges on Thursday blocked the firings of probationary workers at agencies including the departments of Agriculture, Energy and Veterans Affairs. Probationary workers have fewer protections against layoffs. Still, the firings need to go through the proper legal avenues, said U.S. District Judge William Alsup in California.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration will immediately fight Alsup's order. While some probationary employees are expected to return to their jobs as a result of the rulings, their ability to retain those jobs remains uncertain given the continuing legal fight and plans for deeper agency cuts.

Supporters of the overhaul say the government's workforce was due for reinvention, with the last major effort taking place under President Clinton. Republicans have criticized agencies for allowing federal employees to work remotely well past the pandemic, a practice they say has made them less accountable. Trump has ordered workers to return to the office.

Trump in the Oval Office told reporters this month that he wanted to terminate “the people that aren't working, that aren't showing up and have a lot of problems.” He said the government was experiencing “bloat like nobody's ever seen before.”

In interviews, more than 60 current and former federal workers said the wide slashing has worsened services Americans receive and hindered remaining staff working on areas like improving healthcare and lowering energy bills. It also has discouraged top talent from working for the federal government.

Staff cuts have reduced or slowed services for health, education and even operations like weather forecasting.

After facing years of bipartisan criticism from Congress, the Department of Health and Human Services late last year hired a transplant surgeon to help implement fixes to the system that regulates organ transplants.

Dr. Jayme Locke, who left her post at the University of Alabama Birmingham for the federal job, was recently fired as a probationary worker. Transplant experts had hoped she would preside over a new era of making improvements instead of just studying them. Dr. Locke declined to comment. HHS didn't respond to a request for comment.

Weather balloons, which capture information on temperature, humidity and wind, aren't going up regularly in Albany, N.Y., or Gray, Maine, and launches have stopped altogether in Kotzebue, Alaska, due to staffing shortages at the National Weather Service.

National Parks and other federal lands are cutting hours at visitor centers. More than 700 Park Service employees took the government's resignation offer, according to an email to supervisors seen by The Wall Street Journal. Roughly 1,000 probationary employees were fired, according to the National Parks Conservation Association, a nonprofit advocacy group.

A spokeswoman for the Department of the Interior declined to comment on personnel numbers, adding that the agency is improving fiscal responsibility and efficiency. Yosemite will begin taking summer reservations for some campground sites next week. More may become available if operational capacity allows, according to a Friday post from an official park account. People familiar with the delay attributed it to staffing uncertainty. The spokeswoman said the park expects to share more details about reservations later this year.

Oregon's Yaquina Head, a Bureau of Land Management shoreline area, cut hours, halted lighthouse tours and may see closures at the black-stoned Cobble Beach after losing three of seven members of its permanent staff, said Sabrina Gorney, one of the laid-off probationary workers.

“Visitors are going to find that their services are really limited,” said Gorney, 24, who had worked at Yaquina Head as a seasonal employee and in August was promoted to a permanent role making $21.50 per hour.

Gorney's termination letter, viewed by the Journal, said her abilities didn't meet the department's needs. She received three performance awards in less than a year.

Victoria DeLano, 52, worked as an equal-opportunity specialist for the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights. Based in Birmingham, Ala., she processed discrimination allegations against Southeast U.S. schools.

About a month after she was fired, OCR offices in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas and New York were eliminated as the Education Department cut about half of its workforce.

Complaints have piled up, slowing efforts to ensure school access for disabled children in an office where staff were already overworked, she said. “A child is not able to go to school right now until something is in place,” said DeLano, who has advocated against the cuts through her union, the American Federation of Government Employees.

OCR plans to use more mediation and a faster case-processing approach to address disability-related complaints and other harassment complaints, a spokesperson said.

“The dedicated staff of OCR will deliver on its statutory responsibilities,” said Madi Biedermann, the department's deputy assistant secretary for communications.

Some offices have tried to hire back the fired workers. In March the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency, paused the terminations of about 5,900 probationary workers in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The agency said it would bring back those employees with back pay.

Jeffrey Grant, deputy director for operations at an entity within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said 29 of his 82 fired employees were rehired—20 because of their specific responsibilities, the rest because they weren't actually probationary. Some laid-off members of his team, he said, worked on improving the process of how Americans enrolled in insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

He retired in anticipation of mass terminations and later wrote to HHS's acting chief human capital officer that “every one of these people had the ability, knowledge and skills that we require to accomplish our work.”

In many parts of the country, the Trump administration's job cuts have hit services and constituencies that Trump pledged to protect.

Chief among them is the Department of Veterans Affairs, which plans to cut about 70,000 positions and has already laid off thousands. The agency employs about 470,000 people.

Fewer VA staff are handling veterans' claims that will get them treatment for military-service injuries and mental health conditions, two current employees said. This has already resulted in veterans waiting longer to get treatment in North Texas, one said.

Fifteen homeless veterans getting services at a VA community resource center in Denver are now without their assigned housing advocate, Brett Taylor, who was laid off from his role finding apartments for clients and making sure they had deposits. Remaining staff, he said, are overworked already.

“You would think it would make sense to add more providers, add more people, to make sure the veterans were taken care of,” said Taylor, a 37-year-old Army veteran who served in Iraq.

One VA hospital in Detroit canceled programs meant to improve patients' stability and range of motion after the firings of probationary workers, including Kara Oliver, a 33-year-old Navy veteran leading classes and monitoring participants' health and progress.

Oliver, whose salary was about $48,650, realized she was laid off when she went into the office on Feb. 25 and couldn't access her computer. She said she didn't receive her termination letter—useful for filing for unemployment benefits—until March 5.

“I want to be there for my veterans,” she said. But the instability of federal work is making her unsure if she would take a federal job in the future. “It just doesn't feel safe.”

VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said the agency has laid off 2,400 probationary employees in positions including publicists, interior designers and diversity, equity and inclusion officers. The positions amounted to half of one percent of the VA's workforce, he added.

“The notion that these layoffs are causing issues across the department is false,” he said.

Since Trump's inauguration, the administration has gutted entire agencies, teams and categories of employees, only to add some back later. Early targets were the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Officials have tried to wind down the divisions' work and lay off many staff.

The CFPB, created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, investigates complaints from Americans who say their banks charged them improper fees or falsely advertised interest rates.

Matthew Pfaff, chief of staff of the CFPB's Office of Consumer Response, said in a court hearing that more than 16,000 complaints—unprecedented in his memory—piled up when the division was ordered to stop work for weeks.

Layoffs also cut into the work. Among the fired CFPB workers was Milo Chang, 22, who joined the CFPB in June through a program that recruited college graduates to the public sector who may have otherwise sought lucrative jobs in consulting, technology or finance. His team last year analyzed complaints from Missouri to Texas from Americans pressured to refinance their mortgages at higher interest rates after a divorce or the death of a spouse. He learned Sunday he would be rehired due to one of the Thursday rulings but said his future employment remains unclear.

Other agencies have cut probationary employees for performance reasons, without reviewing their performance.

Traci DiMartini, a human capital officer for the Internal Revenue Service, said in a court declaration that it would have taken weeks or months to evaluate 6,700 probationary workers' performance.

That didn't happen: “This fact was discussed openly in meetings,” she said.

She refused to sign the termination notices and was put on administrative leave pending termination, in part because she was “insubordinate and uncooperative with the DOGE employees,” according to her declaration. The IRS didn't respond to a request for comment.

Keith Camire, 48 years old, received one of those letters. He started in September at the IRS to streamline spending on IT. His co-workers, he said, are now scrambling to absorb the work.

Camire, in Milford, Penn., said he voted for Trump three times. He said he's not opposed to downsizing the government but is against the indiscriminate manner in which the cuts are being made.

“Is it mission critical in the sense of police, fire, border security?” he said of the work he was doing. “No, but it's essential to provide fiscal accountability and responsibility, which is what DOGE is about.”

Deeper cuts are expected in the coming months as agencies begin the next phase of the downsizing: a so-called reduction-in-force process that is a highly regulated exercise used infrequently in government. Agencies were told they had until last Thursday to outline how many positions would be cut through attrition, layoffs, a Trump-ordered hiring freeze and the proposed elimination of agencies' functions.

One former senior government official described the process like baking a cake with 20-step directions and that leaders must read the rules countless times. Workers' tenure, veterans status and performance must be taken into account during layoffs.

The Office of Personnel Management on Wednesday told agencies that collective-bargaining agreement provisions that “excessively interfere with management's rights” to lay off employees aren't enforceable. It urged agencies not to respond to every request for information from unions.

In a recent round of cuts, officials at the Energy Department could submit just 200 characters to justify positions, according to two people with knowledge of the process.

In February, teams identified probationary workers who were critical to public safety, the environment and health, or other mission-critical areas, a former official said.

Still, ultimately some fired probationary staff were essential to nuclear facilities, that person said. Though some were reinstated, the agency will now lean more on contractors.

The DOE is finding ways to maximize efficiency while upholding its mission of “unleashing American energy dominance and strengthening our energy security,” said Andrea Woods, an agency spokesperson.

 By Fatos Bytyci 

 KOCANI, North Macedonia -Sporadic violence broke out in North Macedonia on Monday as thousands of people demanded justice for 59 people killed in a nightclub blaze and called for an end to the corruption that they say was behind the country's worst disaster in years. 

 The fire broke out during a hip hop concert in the town of Kocani at around 3 a.m. on Sunday when sparks from flares set a patch of ceiling alight. Hundreds of people scrambled for the unlicensed venue's only exit as flames spread across the roof. 

 The incident has shattered the town of 25,000 people, 50 miles east of the capital Skopje. Bulldozers and workers with shovels dug a line of fresh graves in the town's cemetery on Monday. People with missing loved ones queued outside the hospital to give DNA samples in case their relatives were not immediately identifiable. 

 Officials said that the ""Pulse"" nightclub's licence was illegally obtained and that the venue lacked fire extinguishers and emergency exits. More than 150 people were injured. 

 ""I want everyone who helped this place carry on with its business to be jailed,"" said 16-year-old Jovan, who said he lost a friend in the fire. ""We need change because this is a corrupt country."" 

 Jovan joined thousands of others in a quiet protest in Kocani's central square on Monday. People hugged and cried as they lined up to light candles for the dead and write messages of condolence. 

 Some held placards that read: ""We are not dying from accidents; we are dying from corruption"" and ""Everything is legal here if you have connections"". Hundreds more held a vigil in central Skopje.  

 Violence broke out briefly when a group of people used rocks to smash out the windows of a pub that three protesters said was run by the same person who owned ""Pulse"".  

 Later hundreds of people descended on the mayor's home, throwing rocks and smashing windows. Next door, a family who had lost a relative in the fire looked on in tears.  

 NO WAY OUT  

 The club, which local media described as a former carpet warehouse, is a squat building with a corrugated iron roof that backs onto a grassy vacant lot. It had just one emergency exit, which was locked during Sunday's concert, two fire extinguishers and no fire alarm or sprinkler system, North Macedonia's state prosecutor Ljupco Kocevski said.  

 ""It did not have two exit doors, but only one single improvised metal door at the back of the building, which was locked and without a handle on the inside,"" Kocevski said. 

 The ceiling was made of flammable materials and the plasterboard walls were not fire-resistant. Reuters pictures on Monday showed the club's roof burned through and collapsed in places, its interior wooden beams exposed and blackened. 

 "" operated in substandard conditions. It does not have this and that, and people were making money from it. Who is responsible?"" said Sasa Djenic, a school teacher whose 15-year-old daughter escaped the fire with burns on her arms. 

 Draghi Stojanov's son died in the fire. ""After this tragedy, what do I need this life for? I had one child and I lost him,"" he told Reuters. 

 ILLEGAL LICENCE 

 Authorities have arrested about 20 people in connection with the fire, including government officials and the nightclub's manager. 

 State prosecutor Kocevski said his office was working to determine the criminal liability of a number of people for ""serious offences against public security"" and other crimes. 

 ""The individuals acted contrary to the regulations and technical rules of the protection measures and thereby caused a danger to the life and work of people on a large scale,"" he said. 

 Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski said the club's licence was issued illegally by the economy ministry and said that those responsible would face justice. Former economy minister Kreshnik Bekteshi was questioned by police over the disaster, the local TV 5 broadcaster said. 

 Fifty-one people were treated in hospitals in Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Turkey. Burn specialists from Serbia, the Czech Republic and Israel were expected in North Macedonia on Monday to assist local medical staff. More would be taken to hospitals in Croatia and Romania, officials said.

 The EU led the way on pledging aid for Syria on Monday at a donor drive in Brussels but the call for funding to help the war-torn country after Bashar al-Assad's ouster risked falling short of last year as US support dries up. 

 Western and regional powers are desperate to steer Syria onto the road to stability after 14 years of civil war that have sent millions of refugees over its borders. 

 For the first time, the Syrian authorities were represented at the annual conference in Brussels with interim foreign minister Assaad al-Shibani attending. 

 But an outbreak of deadly violence this month the worst since Assad was toppled in December has rocked confidence in the new Islamist-led authorities. 

 European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said Brussels was stepping up its commitment for this year and next to almost 2.5 billion euros to help those in Syria and neighbouring countries. 

 ""Syrians need greater support, whether they are still abroad, or they decide to go home,"" she told the Brussels conference. 

 The vow from Brussels came on top of significant contributions from individual countries, including some $330 million from Germany and $210 million from Britain. 

 Last year's donor drive raised 7.5 billion euros in grants and loans to help the people of Syria. The overall total for this year will be announced later Monday. 

 Efforts to top that level this time around look set to be hit by US President Donald Trump's axing of Washington's foreign aid budget. 

 Up until now, the United States has been the single biggest individual donor to fund humanitarian efforts in Syria, according to the United Nations. 

 Syria's new rulers headed by former Islamist rebel commander Ahmed al-Sharaa have been clamouring for assistance to help the country's recovery.

 The EU has eased sanctions on key sectors of the economy, but along with other powers it insists the authorities must make good on promises for an inclusive transition. 

 ""We do appreciate the major measures taken by the European Union, such as the lifting or suspending of the sanctions,"" Shibani said. 

 ""However, these measures did not live up so far to our expectations. We want further measures in order to help us secure our recovery."" 

 There have been positive moves from Damascus, including Sharaa signing a constitutional declaration laying out a five-year transitional period, and rights for women and freedom of expression. 

 But hopes were shaken by the violence on Syria's Mediterranean coast, which a war monitor said saw security forces kill nearly 1,500 civilians, most of them members of the Alawite minority to which the Assad family belongs. 

 Shibani insisted that the new authorities would bring to justice ""anyone who perpetrated any crime, whose hands are stained with blood"". 

 ""We believe in the true sense of citizenship, the citizenship of every single citizen of Syria, regardless of their ethnicity or religion,"" he said. 

 The EU has held its annual donor drive for Syria for the past eight years but it mainly focused on supporting refugees in neighbouring countries and avoided any contacts with the Assad regime. 

 Syria's needs are massive as swathes of the country lie in ruins and the economy has been ravaged by years of international isolation after Assad's 2011 crackdown on opposition sparked the civil war. 

 The country still faces a dire humanitarian situation, with an estimated 16.7 million people in need of assistance. 

 ""It would be a mistake to disinvest from Syria now,"" said Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 

 ""Humanitarian aid remains a lifeline that millions of Syrians depend on. Severing it now would only deepen their suffering and prolong the country's recovery,"" she said. 

 The United Nations says that, at current growth rates, Syria would need more than 50 years to get back to its economic level before the outbreak of the war.

 HOUSTON - Oil prices edged higher on Monday after the United States vowed to keep attacking Yemen's Houthis until the Iran-aligned group ends its assaults on shipping while Chinese economic data fuelled hopes for higher demand. 

 U.S. President Donald Trump launched military strikes against the Houthis on Saturday over the group's attacks against Red Sea shipping. One U.S. official told Reuters the campaign might continue for weeks. 

 Brent futures rose 28 cents, or 0.4%, to $70.85 a barrel by 11:25 a.m. ET while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained 22 cents, or 0.3%, to $67.39. 

 The Red Sea port city of Hodeidah and the Al Jawf governorate north of the capital Sanaa were targeted on Monday, the Houthis' Al Masirah TV said. 

 Chinese economic data also supported prices. Retail sales growth quickened over January-February in a welcome sign for policymakers seeking to boost domestic consumption, though unemployment rose and factory output eased. 

 China's crude oil throughput in January and February rose 2.1% versus a year earlier, official data showed on Monday, supported by a new refinery and holiday travel, but weak refining margins persisted. 

 ""The combination of increased stimulus from China and the heightened attack by the Houthi rebels is providing a significant boost this morning,"" said Phil Flynn senior analyst with Price Futures Group. 

 Oil rose slightly last week, though Brent is still down almost 5% this year on concern over a global economic slowdown driven by escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and other nations. 

 OPEC oil producers' plan to raise oil output from April has also pressured prices. However, the prospect of tighter U.S. sanctions against Iran more than offsets the gradual OPEC production increase, said Saxo Bank's Ole Hansen. 

 ""China's plans to boost consumption and fresh Red Sea risks"" are supporting the market on Monday, he added. 

 Meanwhile, Trump said he would speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday about ending the Ukraine war, with territorial concessions by Kyiv and control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant expected to feature prominently in the talks. 

 ""The negative to crude is focused on the tariffs and a Russia/Ukraine peace negotiation which would likely increase Russian crude to the world market.""

Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed on Monday to have twice attacked an American aircraft carrier group within 24 hours, calling it retaliation for deadly US strikes. The Houthis initially said they launched 18 missiles and a drone at the ""aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman and its accompanying warships"" in the Red Sea, before hours later claiming to have fired a second round.

There was no immediate comment from the United States about the Houthis' claimed attacks.

In a statement posted to Telegram on Monday, a Houthi spokesperson said the attacks on the carrier group were ""in retaliation to the continued American aggression against our country"".

Washington has vowed to keep striking Yemen until the rebels stop attacking Red Sea shipping, with President Donald Trump warning he will use ""overwhelming lethal force"".

The Houthi health ministry said women and children were among the 53 people killed and 98 wounded in US strikes on Saturday.

Houthi media reported more explosions on Sunday night, accusing the Americans of targeting a cotton ginning factory in the western region of Hodeida as well as the Galaxy Leader, an Israeli ship captured more than a year ago.

Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called on Yemenis to march on Monday in defiance.

In response to the latest escalation along the maritime trade route, the United Nations has urged both sides to ""cease all military activity"".

The Iran-backed Houthis, who control much of the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country, have attacked Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, claiming to be acting in solidarity with Palestinians.

Before this weekend's targeting of the US carrier group, the Houthis had not claimed attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since January 19, when a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip.

The group said it relaunched its attacks over Israel's halting of humanitarian aid to Gaza, and would ""move to additional escalatory options"" if ""the American aggression against our country continues"".

Washington's weekend strikes against the Houthis were the first since Trump's return to the White House in January.

US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz told ABC News that Saturday's strikes ""targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out"".

Trump meanwhile warned the Houthis that ""hell will rain down upon you"". 

In a social media post addressed to Iran, the US president demanded the Islamic Republic stop supporting ""Houthi terrorists"".

The US Central Command (CENTCOM) confirmed a ""large scale operation"" against the Houthis, which it said on Sunday night was continuing.

Witnesses in Sanaa described experiencing a ""horrific explosion"" that shook houses and shattered windows.

Footage on Houthi media showed children, including a dazed girl with blackened legs wrapped in bandages, and a woman being treated in hospital.

The Houthis have sealed off areas around the blast sites, however, making it impossible to gauge the true scale of the destruction.

One father of two, who gave his name as Ahmed, told AFP: ""I've been living in Sanaa for 10 years, hearing shelling throughout the war. By God, I've never experienced anything like this before"".

""My family and I were terrified,"" he added.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the deadly US strikes and said Washington had ""no authority"" to dictate Tehran's foreign policy.

The Houthis' political bureau said its ""forces are fully prepared to confront escalation with escalation"".

A database set up by ACLED, a non-profit monitor, shows 136 Houthi attacks against warships and commercial vessels, as well as Israeli and other targets since October 19, 2023.

While the Red Sea trade route normally carries about 12 percent of world shipping traffic, Houthi attacks have forced many companies into costly detours around southern Africa.

The Palestinian group Hamas, which has praised Houthi support, branded the US strikes ""a stark violation of international law and an assault on the country's sovereignty and stability"".

The head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, said: ""Iran will not wage war, but if anyone threatens, it will give appropriate, decisive and conclusive responses.""

The United States had already launched several rounds of strikes on Houthi targets.

Israel has also struck Yemen, most recently in December, after Houthi missile fire towards Israeli territory.

Fighting in Yemen's own war has largely been on hold since a 2022 ceasefire, but the promised peace process has stalled in the face of the Houthi attacks on shipping.

The war killed hundreds of thousands either directly or indirectly through causes such as disease, plunging Yemen into one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.

Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw recently visited the Hyperloop testing facility at IIT Madras, where he announced that the Hyperloop tube being developed will soon become the world's longest, stretching 410 meters in length. The minister witnessed a live demonstration of the Hyperloop tube at the testing facility at IIT Madras Discovery Campus in Chennai. Currently, the 410-meter-long Hyperloop test tube at IIT Madras holds the title of Asia's longest Hyperloop test facility. 

""This is one of the longest tubes in Asia at 410 metres. Another 40 metres will be added, then it will become the longest in the world,"" Mr Vaishnaw said. 

The Hyperloop technology, conceptualised by Elon Musk in 2013, is a high-speed transportation system that uses vacuum-sealed tubes to propel pods at speeds over 1,000 km/h. This innovative mode of transportation has the potential to revolutionise travel, making it faster, more efficient, and environmentally friendly.

During his visit, Mr Vaishnaw also revealed plans to develop electronic components for the Hyperloop at Chennai's Integral Coach Factory, highlighting India's commitment to indigenous technology development. Sharing a live demonstration of the Hyperloop on his Instagram account, he wrote, ""Longest Hyperloop tube in Asia (410 m)… soon to be the world's longest.""

Notably, the Ministry of Railways allocated Rs 8.34 crore to IIT Madras in May 2022 to drive indigenous development and validation of Hyperloop technology. The Union Minister expressed optimism about India's readiness to adopt Hyperloop transportation, citing promising results from ongoing tests. 

He said that the entire testing system for Hyperloop transportation has been developed using indigenous technologies, and he congratulated all the young innovators for this achievement.

Congratulating IIT Madras on its cutting-edge innovations, Mr Vaishnaw said, ""This place is so full of so much energy that I cannot describe it. I'm so happy to see young, energetic engineers working on this new technology and doing new experiments. We are providing only small help. I think that this will really lead us to some good solutions for the country, for our people, for our start-ups and the world of technology as well.""

The Hyperloop Technology and IIT Madras

Hyperloop technology, conceptualized by Elon Musk in 2013, represents the 5th mode of transportation, enabling high-speed travel in a near-vacuum tube. By minimizing air resistance, the capsule can reach speeds exceeding 1000 km/h, revolutionising the future of transportation.

IIT Madras has been at the forefront of hyperloop research for the past seven years, significantly contributing to the field. The institute's cutting-edge facilities, including the 422-meter-long operational student-run hyperloop test tube and track at Discovery Campus, have significantly contributed to advancing the field. IIT Madras also recently hosted Asia's first Global Hyperloop Competition, supported by the Ministry of Railways, Government of India.

TuTr Hyperloop, a deep-tech incubated startup at IIT Madras, is set to launch the world's first commercial hyperloop technology-based project in India next month. This historic milestone marks a significant step towards Atmanirbhar Bharat and Viksit Bharat 2047.
