                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The largest crypto now has erased all its 2025 gains and declined 27% from its record high a little more than a month ago. The bearish sentiment spilled into crypto-related equities with Coinbase (COIN), Circle (CRCL), Gemini (GEMI) and Galaxy (GLXY) tumbling around 7%. Digital asset treasury-linked companies continued their descent: Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate bitcoin holder, slid 4% to its lowest since October 2024, while ether treasury firms BitMine (BMNR), ETHZilla fell 8% and 14%, respectively. Bitcoin miners tied to high-performance computing and AI infrastructure fared better after weeks of drawdowns. Thanks to the government shutdown, there hasn't been much in the way of official economic statistics for weeks, making otherwise little-followed reports grow in importance. To wit, this morning's New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. CoinDesk Senior Analyst James Van Straten also pointed to a technical headwind. Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) opened at $93,840 on Sunday, leaving a gap to $91,970 from April still unfilled — a level that may attract short-term downward pressure, as bitcoin frequently revisits such gaps, he noted. Meanwhile, Bitfinex analysts noted that the pace of realized losses is starting to stabilize, suggesting bitcoin could be approaching a local low for at least for a rebound. "Across multiple historical cycles, sustainable bottoms have only formed after short-term holders have capitulated into losses and not before," the analysts said in a note shared with CoinDesk. "The market appears to be approaching that threshold once again, with near-term resilience contingent on whether this capitulation phase can exhaust remaining sell-side pressure." They added that this is now the third-largest pullback since 2023, and second-largest since the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs launched, arguing that a local bottom could form "relatively soon."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UK Man Who Hacked Musk, Obama Accounts for Bitcoin Scam Ordered to Pay Back $5 Million A British man that hacked the social media profiles of former president Barack Obama, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and other celebrities and brands to scam people out of their Bitcoin has been ordered to pay it back—over $5 million worth of BTC and other coins at the current price. Joseph James O'Connor was charged for his role in a 2000 SIM-swapping scheme that led to the takeover of social media profiles for dozens of major accounts, and the subsequent theft of cryptocurrency valued at $794,000 at the time. “Joseph James O'Connor targeted well-known individuals and used their accounts to scam people out of their crypto assets and money,” said Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Proceeds of Crime Division Adrian Foster, in a statement. He was ordered to pay $794,012.64 in forfeiture at that time, and is now responsible for the civil recovery order from the U.K.'s Crown Prosecution Service. Scammers have frequently utilized hacked social media profiles to trick unsuspecting users into parting with their crypto. For example, earlier this year, hackers promoted a fake UFC meme coin on the Solana blockchain after an Instagram account takeover, making away with $1.4 million in proceeds. Similarly, a malicious takeover of the McDonald's Instagram account resulted in $700,000 for hackers on a fake Grimace token last year, and numerous celebrities and other brands have had their accounts hijacked to perpetrate pump-and-dump meme coin scams. A mid-year report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis indicated that more than $2.1 billion has been stolen from crypto users via crimes thus far in 2025, a growing share of which is contributed to personal wallet compromises.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto exchange companies in Canada are evading finance laws by offering to buy thousands of dollars in digital currencies without proper registration or without checking ID. Canada has long had a problem with dirty money in its traditional economy, whether it be in banking, casinos or real estate, but the advent of storefront and online cryptocurrency services and a lack of strong regulation and enforcement are blasting open new frontiers for laundering and illicit finance, experts say. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized by nature, making it difficult for police or fraud victims to identify who is behind millions of transactions in digital currencies like bitcoin, ethereum or tether. But investigators can still track initial purchases of digital coins, or when potential fraudsters offload those coins into hard currency. But the idea that anyone, from drug cartels to would-be terrorist plotters, can use a crypto-to-cash service to wire cryptocurrency to a foreign, unregulated digital wallet and then go collect tens of thousands of dollars in cash anonymously somewhere in town — or the reverse — strips away the controls at the blockchain's on- and off-ramps. "If you have this way to move money with absolutely zero checks on it, you're facilitating an unlimited amount of crime," said Richard Sanders, one of the world's foremost experts on the kinds of crypto-to-cash operations that have cropped up across Canada and around the world. Nick Smart, the chief intelligence officer at Crystal, a company that sells tools to help investigate crypto crimes, said the amount of money being pushed through crypto-to-cash services is "absolutely staggering." To test how easy it would be to find such a service in Canada, Radio-Canada and CBC News partnered with the Toronto Star and La Presse, as part of a global reporting effort called The Coin Laundry from the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. It was no fly-by-night operation: The company is registered with FINTRAC, Canada's national financial-intelligence agency, and its storefront is one of a dozen branches the company has in three provinces. "Hi, I'm here for pickup," the woman said. "Here," the customer said, showing a Canadian $5 bill and its serial number. That $5 bill was the only verification she needed to make sure it was the right person to hand over $1,900 US in cash to — which she promptly did, in $100 bills, from a drawer under the counter. Undercover journalist visits money exchange for anonymous cash handover It is illegal under Canada's anti-laundering regulations for a money transfer business to remit $1,000 or more, including from cryptocurrencies, to someone without recording the recipient's personal information and details about all the accounts involved in the transaction. The rules are in place, among other reasons, to try to make crime less profitable by impeding perpetrators from having freewheeling use of the proceeds of their offences. Iuso said FINTRAC doesn't have the resources to properly oversee all 2,600-plus money-services businesses registered in Canada, let alone to police unregistered ones. So "there's just tons" of foreign money transfer businesses illicitly offering services to Canadians. One web directory lists more than 20 services for converting crypto into cash in cities across the country, from Halifax to Vancouver, none of them registered with FINTRAC. Contacted anonymously by reporters for the Toronto Star, a handful of the Toronto-based services said they wouldn't ask for any ID. Meanwhile in Quebec, a journalist for La Presse entered into his own anonymous discussions with 001k and another crypto-to-cash service that said they could deliver $1 million and $890,000 Cdn, respectively, to locations in Montreal in exchange for sending them tether to specific crypto wallets. The services also never asked for any ID. It wasn't clear where those other offers would direct the customers to go pick up their cash — the location is only revealed once digital money is sent. FINTRAC would not answer questions about the undercover crypto-for-cash transaction or whether it's aware that such services are being offered across Canada by entities like 001k. "FINTRAC is prepared to take strong action as necessary so that businesses take their responsibilities seriously," it said in a statement. "That can include administrative monetary penalties and referrals of any non-compliance to law enforcement." Since August 2022, it has been on the receiving end of more than $14.8 billion US in cryptocurrency transfers, according to data provided to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists by crypto forensics firm Chainalysis. "This is a way to move money with absolutely zero checks."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchain technology is a powerful tool for public administrators to get real-time, tamper-proof transparency in budgeting at a time when people are demanding more accountability and honesty from their governments. Governments can build trust with citizens, lower the risk of corruption, and improve financial management by using blockchain in important parts of the budget cycle, such as allocation, disbursement, and auditing. In this article, we will talk about how blockchain works in public budgeting, show examples of how it has been used in the real world, look at the pros and cons, and give administrators who want to use it some useful tips. At its most basic level, blockchain is a distributed ledger. Smart contracts (self-executing code on the blockchain) also make it possible to automatically enforce financial rules. Blockchain is especially good for managing public finances because it lets you make programmable, conditional payments and hold people more accountable. Blockchain is no longer just a theoretical tool for public finance; several governments and institutions are actively implementing it to enhance transparency, accountability, and efficiency. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has launched a public portal that records Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) and Notices of Cash Allocation (NCAs) on a blockchain. This system represents a bold, practical deployment of blockchain in public finance, making critical budget documents verifiable by citizens and reducing the risk of document tampering. In another notable example, Guinea-Bissau has partnered with the IMF and other technical advisors to deploy a blockchain platform that manages its public wage bill. The platform records salary eligibility, pension disbursements, and payments in near real time on a tamper-evident ledger. The system leverages blockchain to provide a fully traceable, shared ledger of fund disbursement across partners, contractors, and governments. While powerful, implementing blockchain for public budgeting is not without its challenges: Before full-scale deployment, pilots let you test smart contracts, data access, and public engagement. Public, permissioned, or hybrid models can help find a balance between privacy and openness. Smart contracts should automatically release funds when certain conditions are met, such as project milestones or audit approvals. A public portal gives people access to budget information, and auditors and oversight bodies should be involved early on to check it independently. Training staff makes sure that the new system is used correctly, and analytics tools can find problems. Blockchain isn't just a cool piece of technology; when it's used wisely in public financial systems, it can help make things more open, accountable, and trustworthy. Blockchain-based budgeting gives public administrators a chance to rebuild trust with citizens by making budget allocations, payments, and audits easy to check in real time. It needs careful planning, legal work, working together with stakeholders, and the right technical partners. Governments like the Philippines and Guinea-Bissau have shown that blockchain can change public finance from closed ledger books to a system that is open, participatory, and strong. For example, you could tokenize important documents, set up a public verification portal, and make smart contracts for spending that only happen when certain conditions are met. What is the main advantage of using blockchain in government budgeting? Yes, Smart contracts can enforce conditions (milestones, invoice submission, audit approval) before funds are released, ensuring budgeted money is used appropriately. How has a real government implemented blockchain for budget transparency? In the Philippines, the Department of Budget and Management records key budget documents (SAROs and NCAs) on Polygon via a blockchain portal, enabling public verification. What challenges do public administrators face when implementing blockchain budgeting? Key challenges include data privacy, building technical infrastructure, navigating legal recognition of on-chain documents, and securing buy-in from stakeholders. How can governments balance transparency with confidentiality on a public blockchain? They can adopt permissioned or hybrid blockchains and use protocols (e.g., privacy layers) to restrict sensitive information while keeping transactional data auditable.</p>

New video shows the moment Sunrise Police intervened to stop an 80-year-old man from sending money to criminals overseas who convinced him he needed to move the cash. The body camera video shows police arriving as the man was on the phone with the scammers who were posing as his bank and directing him to put cash in a Bitcoin ATM. "Sir, how much money have you put in here?" The man had several stacks of money with him that totaled $60,000. Authorities said the man had already lost more than $50,000 before police intervened and stopped him from sending more. Police were tipped off when the man's son noticed large withdrawals from his bank account and alerted officers. “They created a sense of urgency to him, they told him they were from Chase Bank and that his bank account was compromised and some of the Chase Bank employees were in on it, so he needed to withdraw his money quickly to protect it," Sunrise Police Sgt. The scam started with a pop-up window on the man's computer and from there, the scammers sent him a link which he clicked on and gave them access to his personal information. Police warn everyone to be on alert for callers who claim a loved one or your money is in trouble.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) unveiled EnsembleX, the next phase of Project Ensemble for tokenized deposits and tokenization. The pilot phase will run throughout 2026 with real money transactions, unlike the previous iteration which mainly involved simulations or experimental tokenized deposits. The use cases in focus are tokenized deposits and tokenized money market funds for real time treasury management. This will allow companies to move money 24/7 and to switch into yield bearing money market funds in real time when their funds are idle. Seven banks will be involved in the tokenized deposit trials. They include the three Hong Kong note issuing banks, Bank of China (Hong Kong), HSBC and Standard Chartered. Several commercial firms are also participating in the pilots, including Ant Digital and Ant International, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and HKEX. While many banks have launched internal tokenized deposit solutions, these only allows clients to move money between branches of the same bank.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Perpetual DEXs became the real leaders of on-chain trading in 2025. Perpetual DEXs now account for over 40% of total trading volume, according to the recent DefiLlama analysis. Now, BasePerp, the first Base perpetual DEX, brought institutional interest and investors, announcing its presale. It offers zero-fee trading, up to 100x leverage, and yield options for liquidity providers. Early investors can purchase $BPEP via all major wallets like MetaMask, OKX, Trust, and Coinbase Wallet, and with direct purchase via smart contract. Only 25% of the total supply (6,400,000,000 BPERP) is allocated for the BasePerp presale, with a 15% TGE unlock to provide stable ecosystem growth after launch. How BasePerp Can Become a Trading Hub For Base Chain In 2025, Base became one of the fastest-growing Layer-2 chains with its Coinbase integration and DeFi developers' activity. However, the Base network still lacks liquidity drivers and trader inflow from other ecosystems. The BasePerp team plans to provide an open public testnet and mainnet launch by Q2 2026, and it can bring higher on-chain volume, up to 10x daily trading volume growth, with a liquidity boost for DeFi ecosystems on the Base chain. Additionally, stakers will be able to activate an incentive boost with transferable XP multipliers that will help to unlock new liquidity rewards. The total $BPERP supply is 6.4 billion tokens with steady growth and a transparent allocation structure. The BasePerp tokenomics is designed to accumulate trading volume for the Base ecosystem and provide long-term stability with fair access for investors and traders. This structure is built to provide long-term commitment and ensure protocol growth. BasePerp is a native Base perpetual DEX with advanced AMM features and 100x leverage trading options. It is designed to become a trading hub for Base traders and institutional investors with stable, long-term ecosystem growth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A combination of weakening momentum, strong ETF outflows, and selling from long-term holders has dragged the price of Ethereum lower at a pace that has led to concerns about whether the cryptocurrency is preparing for a deeper correction. Ethereum Price Slips Below Moving Averages As ETF Outflows Deepen New data from 10x Research reveals that Ethereum is now trading firmly below both the 7-day and 30-day moving averages, confirming a clean shift toward bearish momentum. The chart provided by the research firm illustrates how ETH-USD rolled over throughout early November as both moving averages curved downward, indicating that market structure has fully weakened. This technical deterioration is unfolding at the same time the Ethereum ETF market is experiencing one of its heaviest redemptions on record. According to data from SoSoValue, spot ETH ETFs have now seen more than $1.4 billion in net outflows since the beginning of November, a change that shows the decisive shift in institutional appetite. The combination of sustained selling pressure and shrinking ETF demand has created a feedback loop that continues to pull ETH lower whenever each price support level fails. Long-Term Holders Selling Fastest Since 2021, But Whales Are Accumulating On-chain flows paint a picture of an ecosystem under strain. Data shows that long-term ETH holders, wallets that have held their coins for three to ten years, are now selling at their fastest rate since 2021. This group is known to be dormant during most phases of the market, so their recent activity has introduced a strong supply wave that exchanges have struggled to absorb. On-chain data shows that a few large whale wallets have stepped in aggressively during the downturn and bought hundreds of thousands of ETH worth over $1 billion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Traditional stock exchanges have always been seen as the backbone of global finance. They are places where companies raise money, investors trade stocks, and financial markets create value. For decades, stock exchanges operated in a familiar world of brokers, regulations, trading floors, and well-defined processes. What started as a niche market run by small, tech-focused startups is now attracting the attention of global stock exchanges. Big exchanges that once focused only on stocks and bonds are now exploring digital assets. And one of the fastest and safest ways for them to enter the crypto market is through white label exchange solutions. This article explains why traditional stock exchanges want to enter the crypto trading space, how white label exchanges help them launch faster, what challenges they face, and what the future could look like as crypto and traditional finance come together. Crypto trading has grown at a massive pace over the last ten years. What started with Bitcoin has expanded into thousands of digital assets including tokens, stablecoins, utility coins, and digital securities. Global trading volumes sometimes match or even exceed traditional stock markets on busy days. Stock exchanges see this trend and understand that digital assets are becoming a permanent part of the global financial landscape. For stock exchanges, this opens a new source of income without changing their basic business model. More investors are adding crypto to their portfolios. Even traditional investors who previously avoided digital assets are now exploring them. Younger users prefer digital assets and trade through mobile apps. If stock exchanges do not offer crypto services, these users might move to independent crypto platforms, reducing the exchange's relevance. New trading platforms and fintech companies keep entering the market. If stock exchanges stay limited to traditional stocks, they risk falling behind. Offering crypto trading helps them stay modern and competitive. Banks, hedge funds, and large investors are slowly entering the crypto space. These institutions trust regulated stock exchanges more than small, unregulated crypto startups. If stock exchanges offer crypto services, institutions are more likely to invest through them. Many financial experts believe that real estate, bonds, art, gold, and even company shares will be tokenized in the future. Stock exchanges want to be prepared for this shift. Launching a crypto exchange today helps them become ready for wider digital asset trading tomorrow. Building a crypto exchange from scratch is very complex and time-consuming. It requires a strong tech team, advanced security systems, compliance tools, testing frameworks, and constant updates. For a stock exchange, this can take years and cost millions. This is where white label exchanges come in. A white label exchange is a ready-made crypto trading platform that can be customized with the stock exchange's own branding, features, and design. A white label platform can be launched within weeks instead of waiting years to develop a new one. This allows stock exchanges to enter the crypto market quickly and start attracting users before their competitors. Building a crypto exchange from the ground up can cost millions of dollars. White label exchanges cost much less because the development work is already done. The stock exchange only pays for customization, licensing, and ongoing support. Security is the most important part of any exchange. White label platforms come with features like multi-layer encryption, two-factor authentication, cold storage for funds, and advanced fraud detection. This saves stock exchanges the stress of building and testing security systems on their own. Exchanges must follow rules such as KYC, AML, data reporting, user verification, and transaction monitoring. As user numbers grow, the platform must handle more transactions per second. White label solutions are designed to scale easily, which helps stock exchanges support millions of users without downtime. Stock exchanges can add features that match their brand quality. This includes custom dashboards, trading tools, mobile apps, APIs for institutions, staking, payments integration, and more. When a stock exchange decides to launch a white label crypto exchange, the process usually follows these steps. The exchange shares its needs, such as trading types, supported currencies, security preferences, compliance rules, and branding guidelines. Developers customize the platform with logos, UI design, color themes, trading tools, and region-specific rules. The platform is connected to blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. This allows users to deposit, trade, and withdraw digital assets. Critical security features like multi-signature wallets, DDoS protection, encryption layers, and cold wallet storage are added. The platform undergoes testing for performance, security, scalability, and compliance. Once everything is ready, the exchange launches its crypto trading services with full customer support. The development team provides updates, bug fixes, new features, and security patches to keep the exchange running smoothly. Many well-known exchanges have already stepped into the crypto world. SIX launched a digital asset trading platform for crypto and security tokens. The London Stock Exchange has announced plans to create a digital asset marketplace that follows strict regulations. SGX has actively partnered with blockchain companies and is exploring ways to offer tokenized securities trading. These examples show a clear trend: stock exchanges know that crypto is not temporary. It is becoming a large and important part of global finance. Even with white label solutions, stock exchanges still face several challenges when entering the crypto market. Exchanges must keep up with new rules in every region they serve. Some countries restrict certain types of tokens or require extra licenses. Exchanges must protect users and maintain stable operations even during market crashes or extreme trading volume. Stock exchanges must ensure complete protection and be ready for new cyber threats. Stock exchanges must educate users, share transparent information, and build trust. Exchanges must keep updating their systems to stay competitive. As crypto becomes more integrated with traditional finance, the role of stock exchanges will continue to grow. Companies may start issuing digital tokens instead of traditional shares. This will allow faster settlements, lower costs, and global access. We may soon see platforms where users can trade stocks, crypto, commodities, and tokenized assets in one place. Banks, investment firms, and pension funds will become more active in crypto once they see regulated exchanges offering reliable services. Central Bank Digital Currencies may become part of trading platforms, offering faster and safer transactions. Crypto allows global trading without the need for multiple banking systems. Stock exchanges can become global trading hubs for digital assets. White label exchange solutions help stock exchanges start this journey quickly, safely, and cost effectively. As more traditional exchanges explore digital assets, we will see a financial system that is more open, modern, and accessible to people everywhere. This transformation will continue in the coming years, and it will be shaped by innovation in white label crypto exchange development. I write to simplify complex concepts and spark meaningful conversations. New traders should start by educating themselves on how blockchain, exchanges, and wallets work, then choose a reputable trading platform with strong security measures. It's important to invest only what you can afford to lose, begin with small amounts, and diversify rather than placing all funds into a single asset. Using risk-management tools such as stop-loss orders, dollar-cost averaging, and maintaining a long-term strategy also helps stabilize returns. Keeping emotions in check—avoiding fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) or panic selling—is equally crucial for consistent performance. )us integrates advanced security protocols, real-time market analytics, and automated risk-control features that help protect traders from volatility and fraudulent activity. Its platform uses AI-driven insights to guide decision-making, while its custodial safeguards and multi-layer encryption protect user funds from unauthorized access. With professional support, transparent operations, and built-in risk-management tools, ChainCapital enables both beginners and experienced traders to navigate the crypto market with greater confidence and reduced exposure to potential losses. Horse racing has always been seen as a world for the wealthy. Expensive auctions, million dollar racehorses, and high maintenance costs made ownership something only the rich could enjoy. Tokenization platforms are turning racehorse ownership into something ordinary people can participate in, even with small amounts of money. The real estate sector across Europe—particularly in Spain—is at a turning point. While the demand for property remains strong, real estate professionals are facing increasing pressure to deliver faster, more engaging marketing content without inflating their budgets. When Google's cloud-based technologies failed on Wednesday, November 12, 2025, there appeared to be a brief stop in global digital production. This was a disruptive reminder of how much we depend on constantly operating cloud infrastructure for both consumers and organizations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Across four days of intense competition, the United States delivered one of the most dominant displays in ICO history, bringing home an astonishing 164 world titles in forms, weapons, point fighting, continuous sparring, team events, and more. This year, Master Clayton Watkins earned his place in that circle. Representing East Texas and the American sport-martial-arts community, Watkins joined a coaching lineup filled with international icons—champion makers, technical innovators, and long-respected leaders in the field. Shoulder to shoulder with these world-class coaches, he contributed to game-winning strategies, ringside tactics, and athlete preparation throughout the event. His presence in Wales showcased what his students and peers already know—he is one of the most effective, respected, and influential coaches in the United States today. The American performance was nothing short of breathtaking. 164 world championships across multiple disciplines, a medal count that stunned countries around the globe and reaffirmed the United States as a powerhouse in international sport karate. This achievement reflects not just talent, but the unity, preparation, and coaching excellence that drove the team for months leading up to Wales. Though the world stage was bright, East Texas shined with it. Master Clayton Watkins' contribution extended far beyond corner coaching. He brought leadership, discipline, and an athlete-centered approach that helped competitors stay composed under pressure and execute at the highest level. ProComp's fingerprints were felt throughout Team USA's performance. The 2025 ICO World Championships in Wales will be remembered as a landmark moment—a year when Team USA didn't just participate, but dominated. a coach who has devoted his life to building champions in both skill and character.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NFTs are not just quirky cartoons of apes and anime avatars, argues this new book from Taschen, but an education on the possibility of art, ownership, collecting and trading. At one point, NFTs were a major talking point in the art world, with a sudden well of opportunity opening up for digital artists and budding art collectors. However, artist and author Robert Alice – a trained art historian who most notably co-produced the first academic conference on NFTs at the University of Oxford in 2022 – is challenging the idea that NFTs are purely synonymous with art (a presumption that ignores their surprising 50 year history). Described as a groundbreaking technology, digital art is only the first chapter in its evolution, as Robert makes a compelling case for how NFTs can expand on ideas of ownership and collectables. “The low cost, democratic nature of the medium, like paper and the printing press before, has and will continue to usher in a democratising revolution in terms of publishing.” NFTs used to be a bit of a dirty word that would conjure up stereotypical images of kitsch gorilla drawings, pixel characters and anime avatars, but Robert's near 700 page artist-led book is filled with striking and alternative images that could only take place in the virtual world of cryptoart. Alongside Rutherford Chang, Leander Herzog, Kim Asendorf, Shl0ms, Roope Rainisto and Jack Butcher, the book also includes 60s computer compositions by A. Michael Noll, Rafael Rozendaal's trippy patchwork art recently shown in MoMa, generative WebGL artworks, and Anna Ridler's early and important NFTs, all of which share unique relationships with the digital medium and the act of viewing art through the desktop. “Both Herzog and Asendorf in their own respective ways with Infinite Garden and PXL DEX have created technically complex work that uses the blockchain as a medium to create collaborative works that engage the collector,” says Robert. In a world of exponential synthetic image and video generation, where you can't tell what is real or not, how will you be able to know an image of google is real?” asks Robert. Or a permissionless blockchain?” With NFT's unique relationship with provable ownership and digital collecting, they can create a space for artists where they have an intimate connection with how their art is distributed, stored, bought and traded, especially as a more sophisticated digital art market has emerged.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee's Ethereum price prediction was wrong, and ETH made a new ATH for all of two seconds. And the only coins that did anything notable were flagrant casino 1000x tokens. Meanwhile, Ether cracked below the $3,100 level for the first time since early November, slipping to $3,066 on Sunday during a broader crypto pullback. Investment manager Timothy Peterson highlighted a worrying trend that isn't visible in headline ETF flows. “Spot ether ETFs posted net outflows in four of the past five weeks, totaling roughly 7 percent of cost-basis capital,” Peterson said. Cost-basis withdrawals track how much of the original capital committed to an ETF is leaving and it isn't look good for Ethereum. Rising redemptions here show conviction weakening among long-term holders, not just traders repositioning. A sweep across key analytics platforms adds more context to the ETH price: DeFi Llama: ETH TVL fell 2.1 percent this week, reversing prior gains FRED (Rates): Long-term yields remain elevated, restraining risk assets Despite the volatility, ETH still trades comfortably above its 200-day moving average near $2,550, a level that has historically defined cycle support zones. Ethereum's 4-hour chart shows price locked inside a narrowing falling wedge, which is a corrective pattern that often precedes upside breaks. ETH has repeatedly been rejected at the upper trendline and the stacked supply zones near $3,550 and $3,800. A decisive reclaim of $3,350 will flip the short-term trend and open a path back toward $3,550. Failure keeps the wedge intact and elevates the risk of a $3,000 retest or even a quick liquidity sweep below it before any true reversal. Ether slipping under $3,100 says more than a bad trading day. ETF outflows, shaky macro signals, and stubborn resistance have all piled onto the chart at the same time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Americans who want to transfer money online have options. They can go with services like Venmo and PayPal, make transfers from their personal bank, or do a transaction with stablecoins issued by cryptocurrency companies. All those options have something in common that may not always occur to consumers: The transfers are offered by exclusively by private companies. That means users' accounts aren't stuffed with physical dollars, but rather with promises made by private companies to make the recipient whole. Unlike with cash money, the system creates a middleman for every dollar spent — and an opportunity for them to make a profit off the digital equivalent of something so simple as handing someone else a bill. There's no way to send money digitally without involving a company that has an angle. With cash on the way out — the last penny was just minted, for instance — there is a possible future where every single monetary transaction between people involves private interests. Academics have been exploring this question for years, asking why the federal government can't back its own digital currency to facilitate transfers between people. In the U.S., those researchers never got past an exploratory phase, but that did not stop a central bank digital currency from becoming a boogeyman for right-wing activists. The Republican House majority whip, Rep. Tom Emmer, warned that the Chinese Communist Party uses a digital currency to spy on its citizens. Online memes dubbed them a “mark of the beast.” Donald Trump promised to ban them last year, and followed through with an executive order in January. Now, Republicans are trying to make sure that no matter who is president, private companies will forever hold the monopoly on Americans sending money to each other online. The bill would even prevent research on government-issued digital currencies. They're pushing a formal, codified ban that would squash government competition to private payments before it ever gets started. The bill would even prevent research on government-issued digital currencies. In the Bahamas, citizens can use smartphone apps or plastic cards to make fee-free purchases and transfers with the digital Bahamian dollar. American boosters of central bank digital currencies, such as former President Joe Biden, say it is important that the U.S. not get left behind. “The digital yuan, Major, is a financial surveillance tool,” he told CBS News' Major Garrett in an interview earlier this year. Still, she believes that it is important to keep studying central bank digital currencies, given the inevitable trend toward more digital transactions. Narula is adamant that a central bank digital currency could be built with privacy protection at its core. After all, there are already cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin that allow their users to remain mostly anonymous. Digital currency critics, by contrast, paint them as Orwellian tools of government oversight. One skeptic argued that privacy protections would be too vulnerable to the whims of an administration. And that's a very important point to stress here,” said Nicholas Anthony, an analyst with the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. “Once a crisis occurs, it would be so easy to have privacy protections ripped away.” “Our financial transactions reveal so much about us,” he said. “Anyone in power can really use it to their advantage. Private offerings come with a host of privacy concerns as well, Anthony acknowledged. Others aren't so sure and think the issue may be operating as a smokescreen for private companies. “You hear a lot of high-minded rhetoric about CBDCs being a threat to people or privacy, but at the end of the day, this is really about what roles the public and private sector play in finance,” said Mark Hays, an advocate with the left-leaning groups Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress. By banning even government research on central bank digital currencies, MIT Media Lab's Narula warned, the legislation also risks endangering further progress on privacy protections. “There's certain experience that only people in government have when it comes to administrating our monetary system,” she said. “So to cut them off from participating in this research means that we are not going to get to the best outcomes, because we don't have the best minds working on it.” By signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. If a ban comes to pass, the field of digital payments will be left wide open for private industry. That could present a profitable market opportunity for financial services companies and cryptocurrency startups. The stablecoin industry already has a market capitalization of over $300 billion, and it is poised to explode in the wake of recent legislation supported by Trump, himself a stablecoin entrepreneur. In fact, cryptocurrency companies have been some of the most vociferous opponents of central bank digital currencies after initially exploring partnerships with the U.S. government on them. Critics point out that government-issued digital dollars could compete with stablecoins, which earn profit for their private issuers from the interest on U.S. bonds and other securities backing consumer accounts. “Your HUD grant would be brought to you by Circle or Tether.” Still, he worries that private interests are moving to take control of financial infrastructure that should belong to the public. “How far they get is anybody's guess, but the fact that they are floating it gives you a signal of their intentions. They would like to see a world where that fundamental architecture — which we would argue needs to be democratically controlled — is another way of putting more of that system under private control, including crypto.” What we're seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump's assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” Then they saw Epstein write that Trump “knew about the girls.” By signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Kent Halliburton stood in a bathroom at the Rosewood Hotel in central Amsterdam, thousands of miles from home, running his fingers through an envelope filled with €10,000 in crisp banknotes, he started to wonder what he had gotten himself into. Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates bitcoin mining hardware on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States. As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family. The family office had offered to purchase hundreds of bitcoin mining rigs from Sazmining—around $4 million worth—which the company would install at a facility currently under construction in Ethiopia. When Halliburton arrived at the Rosewood Hotel, he found Even and Maxim perched in a booth. They struck him as playboy, high-roller types—particularly Maxim, who wore a tan three-piece suit and had a highly manicured look, his long dark hair parted down the middle. A Rolex protruded from the cuff of his sleeve. Over a three-course lunch—ceviche with a roe garnish, Chilean sea bass, and cherry cake—they discussed the contours of the deal and traded details about their respective backgrounds. Even was talkative and jocular, telling stories about blowout parties in Marrakech. As a relationship-building exercise, Even proposed that Halliburton sell the family office around $3,000 in bitcoin. Halliburton was initially hesitant, but chalked it up as a peculiar dating ritual. “It felt like something out of a James Bond movie,” says Halliburton. For Sazmining, a small company with around 15 employees, it promised to be transformative. Directly after his lunch with Even and Maxim, Halliburton flew to Latvia for a Bitcoin conference. They landed on $400,000 worth—a tenth of the overall deal value. Having been away from his family for weeks, Halliburton protested. But Even drew a line in the sand: “Remotely doesn't work for me that's not how I do business at the moment,” he wrote in a text message reviewed by WIRED. As they waited for a table, Maxim asked Halliburton whether he could demonstrate that Sazmining held enough bitcoin to go through with the side transaction that Even had proposed. The funds would remain under Halliburton's control, but the family office would be able to verify their existence using public transaction data. With Maxim at his side, Halliburton downloaded the app and created a new wallet. “I was trying to earn this guy's trust,” says Halliburton. Maxim was less guarded this time; he talked about his fondness for watches and his work sourcing deals for the family office. Thanks for your patience,” wrote Halliburton in a WhatsApp message to Even. When it arrived, he sent a screenshot of the updated balance to Even. One minute later, Even wrote back, “Thank yiu [sic].” Halliburton sent another message to Even, asking about the contracts. Though previously quick to answer, Even didn't respond. Halliburton checked the Atomic Wallet app, sensing that something was wrong. “It was like being punched in the gut,” says Halliburton. Halliburton racked his brain trying to figure out how he had been swindled. At 11:30 pm, he sent another message to Even: “That was the most sophisticated scam I've ever experienced. I know you probably don't give a shit but my business may not survive this. I've worked four years of my life to build it.” Even did not respond to a request for comment. Within hours, the funds drained from Halliburton's wallet began to be divided up, shuffled through a web of different addresses, and deposited with third-party platforms for converting crypto into regular currency, analysis by blockchain analytics companies Chainalysis and CertiK shows. A portion of the bitcoin was split between different instant exchangers, which allow people to swap one type of cryptocurrency for another almost instantaneously. The bulk was funneled into a single address, where it was blended with funds tagged by Chainalysis as the likely proceeds of rip deals, a scam whereby somebody impersonates an investor to steal crypto from a startup. “However, the fact that they leveraged consolidation addresses that appear very tightly connected to labeled scam activity is potentially indicative of a fraud operation.” Some of the bitcoin that passed through the consolidation address was deposited with a crypto exchange, where it was likely swapped for regular currency. The remainder was converted into stablecoin and moved across so-called bridges to the Tron blockchain, which hosts several over-the-counter trading services that can be readily used to cash out large quantities of crypto, researchers claim. “Though we can trace through a bridge, it's a way to slow the tracing of funds from investigators that could be on your tail.” From the transaction data, it's not possible to tell precisely how the scammers were able to access and drain Halliburton's wallet without his permission. But aspects of his interactions with the scammers provide some clue. Initially, Halliburton wondered whether the incident might be connected to a 2023 hack perpetrated by threat actors affiliated with the North Korean government, which led to $100 million worth of funds being drained from the accounts of Atomic Wallet users. (Atomic Wallet did not respond to a request for comment.) “Executives who are publicly known to custody large crypto balances make attractive targets,” says Guanxing Wen, head of security research at CertiK. The in-person dinners, expensive clothing, reams of cash and other displays of wealth were gambits meant to put Halliburton at ease, researchers theorize. “This is a well-known rapport-building tactic in high-value confidence schemes,” says Wen. Equipped with a wallet's seed phrase, anyone can gain unfettered access to the bitcoin kept inside. It would all fit inside a couple of suitcases,” says Adrian Cheek, lead researcher at cybersecurity company Coeus. But Halliburton insists that his phone never left his possession, and he used mobile data to download the Atomic Wallet app, not public Wi-Fi. “They're normally recruited through underground forums, and secure chat groups,” says Cheek. For a few days, it remained unclear whether Sazmining would be able to weather the financial blow. The stolen funds equated to about six weeks worth of revenue. “I'm trying to keep the business afloat and survive this situation where suddenly we've got a cash crunch,” says Halliburton. By delaying payment to a vendor and extending the duration of an outstanding loan, the company was ultimately able to remain solvent. They received acknowledgements from only UK-based Action Fraud, which said it would take no immediate action, and the Cyber Fraud Task Force, a division of the US Secret Service. (The CFTF did not respond to a request for comment.) The incredible volume of crypto-related scam activity makes it all but impossible for law enforcement to investigate each theft individually. In that scenario, any funds recovered are typically dispersed to those who have reported themselves victims. Until such a time, Halliburton has to make his peace with the loss.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The numbers are going top of the roof because there are more than enough cherries to grab at just $0.01 for each token. Players join the presale, grab their allocation, and automatically qualify for the giveaway that includes tokens, NFTs, USDT, in-game rewards and a Whopping $500,000 giveaway for early buyers. In a sector where most projects struggle to get off the ground, EV2 is already making waves. Its tokenomics are designed to trim the fat and keep players hooked, while the Battle Pass system ensures gamers are getting a big chop of ROI. With a total supply of 2.88 Billion tokens and a hard cap that stops at 50 million, the tokenomics show a system that tries to keep things balanced instead of letting supply inflate endlessly. Meanwhile 40% also sits in presale allocation which gives a rough idea of where interest is forming. At this moment, nearly $400,000  has already been raised and more than 38M  tokens are in the hands of early participants. This is not surprising because the token is driven by profitable utility like storage upgrades, gear crafting, rewards, and marketplace activity. Fracture is the first game mode that jumps out and not just because it throws twenty five players into frantic free for all combat. The map scatters glowing cubes in three colours and each colour becomes a stepping stone toward a final relic that only one player can claim. It sounds simple but the trick is that death resets your progress and steals do happen when rivals grab the cubes you collected. The Cloaker suit fits this mode like a glove. Survivor is the lone wolf challenge that forces players to rely on instinct because one mistake can send them right back to the lobby. It is a last man standing format where the environment shifts and demands smart movement more than reckless aggression. The Mag suit adds a different flavour to this mode. Its control over cosmic energy lets players heal when battles drag on and strike with hybrid elemental attacks when moments turn critical. This combination makes Mag feel like a flexible choice, especially for players who want a little safety net without playing too slow. EV2 uses simple systems to keep players active without making things look complicated. Holocrons let players enter high stakes matches for rare rewards. Some future items may arrive as NFTs on the wider Web3 marketplace, although this part still sits in the maybe zone. All things considered, EV2 presents itself as a project that tries to merge strong design with easy entry, changing the narrative around Web3 gaming. The numbers are growing massively in a blink of an eye. It wouldn't be long before traders will feel they have missed out on something great and at a steal price. We do not share any kind of investment advice. NFT Games are very risky and come with no guarantees.</p>
