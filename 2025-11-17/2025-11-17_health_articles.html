                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yet for more than 12 million Americans living with visual impairments, even small deficits can profoundly impact daily life, limiting independence and overall quality of life. Researchers have long recognized the potential of visual perceptual learning (VPL) – a process by which the brain improves its ability to detect subtle differences in visual stimuli, such as fine patterns or orientations – to enhance vision. VPL is already being explored in professional contexts such as radiology, where precise detection of faint anomalies in medical images can save lives. However, a significant challenge remains: improvements in visual perception through VPL are typically confined to the exact part of the visual field that is trained, greatly restricting its broader clinical and practical applications. To address this challenge, Luke Rosedahl, Ph.D., principal investigator, an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering within the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University, and a Sensing Institute (I-SENSE) fellow, has received a $746,998, three-year grant from the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health. Rosedahl's work focuses on how different forms of attention – such as feature-based attention, which focuses on specific characteristics of visual stimuli, and spatial attention, which directs focus to particular locations in the visual field – interact to enable the transfer of visual learning to untrained areas. This grant represents an incredible opportunity to advance our understanding of how the brain learns to see and how that learning can be made more adaptable. By identifying how attention contributes to this process, we can develop more effective training paradigms for vision rehabilitation and potentially create artificial intelligence systems that mimic the human brain's remarkable ability to adapt and learn from visual experience." Rosedahl's project will employ a combination of computational modeling, brain imaging, and neurochemical analysis to study how visual information is reorganized during learning. The research will specifically investigate a technique known as "double-training," in which training on a secondary, seemingly unrelated task at a new visual field location prompts the transfer of previously acquired visual skills to that location. By integrating data from behavioral performance measures, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and changes in neurotransmitter concentrations measured through magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the project aims to develop a unified model of visual processing, VPL and attention. "We expect this model to not only advance fundamental neuroscience but also serve as a valuable resource for the broader scientific community studying visual learning in real-world scenarios," said Rosedahl. For professionals in fields such as radiology, surveillance or any domain that relies on nuanced visual discrimination, these insights could inform advanced training methods that enhance accuracy and performance. Rosedahl's long-term research goal is to understand the interactions between multiple visual processes including category learning, visual perceptual learning, and attention, to optimize both training paradigms and rehabilitation strategies. His work builds on prior findings that VPL is typically highly location-specific, aiming to uncover how combinations of attention mechanisms can overcome this limitation. Over the next three years, Rosedahl and his team will work to decode the neural processes underlying flexible visual learning, paving the way for more effective interventions for individuals with visual impairments and novel approaches to training in professional fields that demand high-level visual expertise. "Professor Rosedahl's work addresses a fundamental challenge in vision science with enormous real-world impact," said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. "By uncovering how the brain can generalize visual learning, this research could transform vision rehabilitation and professional training, redefining what is possible for individuals with visual impairments and advancing our understanding of human perception.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at The University of Osaka have engineered a novel technique, Balloon-Assisted Bronchoscope Delivery (BDBD), to guide endoscopes to small, early-stage lung cancers hidden deep within the periphery of the lungs. While CT scans have improved the detection of small, suspicious lesions in the peripheral lung fields, obtaining a definitive diagnosis requires a tissue biopsy. However, the bronchi-the airways of the lung-become progressively narrower and more complex toward the periphery, making it physically impossible for conventional bronchoscopes to reach these remote targets. Clinicians were often forced to stop several centimeters away, limiting the precision of biopsies and subsequent treatment. Instead of pursuing thinner endoscopes, the research team adopted a paradigm-shifting approach: widening the airway to create a path. In a first-in-human clinical trial, the team successfully demonstrated that this technique is both safe and effective, enabling access to lesions smaller than 20 mm. This enhanced accessibility is expected to dramatically improve the diagnostic accuracy for early-stage lung cancer, allowing for earlier and more effective intervention. Furthermore, it paves the way for future endoscopic therapies, where tumors can be treated in a minimally invasive manner without the need for major surgery. BDBD is a homegrown Japanese technology developed through industry-academia collaboration. Our study has demonstrated its utility and safety. By allowing us to reach deep into the lungs where we couldn't before, we expect to significantly expand the options for early diagnosis and minimally invasive treatment of lung cancer."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elinzanetant improves sleep disturbances independent of improvements in vasomotor symptoms, according to data presented at The Menopause Society 2025 Annual Meeting. Elinzanetant is a nonhormonal drug that the US Food and Drug Administration approved October 24 to treat hot flashes and night sweats. Data from 1898 women enrolled in the four randomized controlled OASIS trials showed that elinzanetant reduced the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms not only in postmenopausal middle-aged women but also, in one trial, in women aged 18-70 who had HR+ breast cancer, were receiving endocrine therapy, and were experiencing at least 35 moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms per week. "These findings highlight the potential for elinzanetant to improve sleep through mechanisms beyond vasomotor symptom alleviation and support the notion that sleep disturbances in menopause are not solely caused by vasomotor symptoms," Pauline Maki, PhD, told attendees. "Further research is warranted to elucidate the pathways through which elinzanetant exerts its direct effects on sleep." Maki, a professor of psychiatry, psychology, and obstetrics & gynecology at the University of Illinois in Chicago, presented pooled data from 1345 women enrolled across three phase 3 trials and one phase 2 trial that compared 120 mg of elinzanetant to placebo over 12 weeks. Two of the phase 3 trials, OASIS-1 and OASIS-2, included postmenopausal women who reported at least 50 vasomotor symptoms per week. OASIS-3 included postmenopausal women who reported any bothersome vasomotor symptoms, regardless of frequency. While none of these trials required participants to report sleep disturbances, the phase 2 NIRVANA trial included postmenopausal women with at least 20 vasomotor symptoms per week as well as sleep disturbances. Researchers used a longitudinal causal mediation analysis to understand the total treatment effect and the effect on sleep independent of reduction in nighttime vasomotor symptoms. When taking into account changes due to vasomotor symptoms, however, researchers calculated that 2.25 of those points were due to improvements in symptoms while 2.67 points occurred directly because of elinzanetant separate from improvements in night sweats. Overall, researchers calculated that 54.3% of the improvement in sleep disturbances was directly due to elinzanetant even without vasomotor symptom improvements. "It's very exciting to have another option for people who either don't want to be on hormone therapy or have a contraindication to being on hormone therapy," Monica Christmas, MD, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology and director of the Menopause Program at the University of Chicago Medicine, told Medscape Medical News. "One of the nice things about this is that sleep was improved even outside of correcting for vasomotor symptoms," Christmas said. She found the safety profile of elinzanetant reassuring as well. Another important thing about this, Christmas said, "is that they didn't show in their safety data that there were the same hepatic concerns" as those seen with fezolinetant, the only other approved nonhormonal drug in the same class as elinzanetant. "With elinzanetant, because they didn't show the same liver concerns, the recommendation is just to check liver function at baseline and at 3 months," she added. Adding to the safety profile, "this one was also studied in women with a history of breast cancer," unlike fezolinetant, Christmas added. Christmas has given lectures for FertilityIQ and had no other disclosures.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today marks the first World Cervical Cancer Elimination Day – mandated by the World Health Assembly – a historic milestone in global efforts to end a preventable cancer. This day of action builds on powerful momentum, with countries and partners uniting to launch ambitious vaccination campaigns, expand screening and treatment services, and accelerate progress toward eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem. More and more countries are scaling up HPV vaccination, improving screening, and expanding treatment, bringing us closer to a future free of cervical cancer." This momentum is underscored by the announcement from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and its partners, who estimate that the ambitious goal to reach 86 million girls by the end of 2025 has been met, reflecting a broader wave of country action to advance national elimination plans and expand access to screening and treatment. Countries are marking World Cervical Cancer Elimination Day with a wave of actions on multiple fronts. Vaccination is scaling up through campaigns in Sierra Leone and Liberia targeting over 1.5 million girls. Screening efforts are also intensifying, with Sierra Leone planning a mass campaign across all 16 districts, followed by an awareness walk. Meanwhile, in Malaysia, advocacy is taking center stage as survivors lead a week-long promotion of self-sampling HPV testing, a key innovation for expanding screening access. This past year has seen significant country-level action, providing a powerful foundation for the new annual commemoration. Countries worldwide are accelerating efforts to expand access to HPV vaccination, screening, and treatment, advancing toward the 90-70-90 targets of the Global Strategy.

There is massive variation among phages, but researchers don't know the roles played by many individual genes. Hatfull collaborated with Ansa Biotech and New England Biolabs, combining their unique techniques for synthesizing and assembling DNA with his expertise in phages and mycobacterium. The team constructed synthetic DNA modeled after two naturally occurring phages that attack mycobacterium (which include the pathogens responsible for tuberculosis and leprosy, among others).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, et al. have published a case report entitled "Acquired immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) associated with inactivated COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac". This report was published in Frontiers of Medicine, Volume 18, Issue 4, 2024. Acquired immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare but life-threatening bleeding disorder. However, whether inactivated COVID-19 vaccines (such as CoronaVac) could cause TTP and whether the symptoms of TTP cases induced by inactivated vaccines are different from those of previously reported cases remain unclear. The researchers reported two cases of TTP that developed after vaccination with CoronaVac. Both patients developed TTP after receiving the second dose of CoronaVac, with no abnormalities observed after the first dose. They presented with symptoms including fever, neurological abnormalities, renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and hemolysis. Both patients achieved complete remission through several sessions of plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy. The number of newly diagnosed TTP cases during this period was 11, 6, 16, and 17 respectively. The incidence of TTP decreased in 2020 and then increased in 2021-2022, which is presumably related to the administration of COVID-19 vaccines. This study is the first report on TTP associated with inactivated COVID-19 vaccines such as CoronaVac. The rarity and delayed onset of TTP may be attributed to the relatively milder immune response induced by inactivated vaccines. Timely plasma exchange is a vital treatment for such TTP cases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study has discovered a molecular signal that tumors exploit to exhaust the T cells meant to destroy them-and how silencing that signal could revive the body's immunity. The study led by Weill Cornell Medicine researchers was published Nov. 17 in Nature Immunology and shows that tumors not only evade the immune system but can actively reprogram immune cells to stop fighting. This discovery moves us closer to a future where the immune system itself defeats tumors," said the study's co-senior author, Dr. Taha Merghoub, Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor in Oncology Research, and professor of pharmacology at Weill Cornell Medicine. In recent years, immunotherapy has transformed cancer care, offering a way to rally the body's own immune system to fight tumors. But even with these advances, many patients still don't respond-or their initial response fades as their immune cells become exhausted. Our findings reveal a completely new way that tumors suppress the immune system. By blocking this pathway, we can help exhausted T cells recover their strength and make existing immunotherapies work better for more patients." Dr. Jedd Wolchok, co-senior author, the Meyer Director of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, professor of medicine, Weill Cornell and oncologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center T cell exhaustion is a phenomenon triggered by continued exposure to chronic infections or tumors that activate the immune system. The embattled immune cells remain capable of recognizing their foes, but they no longer attack them. "So, they're primed, but they're no longer killing," said Dr. Merghoub, who is also deputy director of the Meyer Cancer Center and co-director of the Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy at Weill Cornell. "Although such cellular surrender may seem counterproductive, it serves as a brake to protect against out-of-control inflammation and sepsis," Dr. Merghoub said. Previous work from other labs has demonstrated that a protein called PD1 on the surface of T cells plays a key role in putting the brakes on T cells. Checkpoint-inhibitor drugs, which target PD1, have been remarkably successful in reviving T cells to treat cancers such as melanomas. The researchers started out investigating whether CD47 molecules present on cancer cells contributed to T cell exhaustion. But they were surprised to discover that CD47 has another function on the surface of T cells. Their experiments found that mice lacking CD47 had delayed tumor growth. They suspected that eliminating CD47 on T cells could be beneficial. When tested in mice with melanoma, T cells lacking CD47 were better at fighting the cancer than T cells, which had CD47 intact. They focused on a large protein called thrombospondin-1 that interacts with CD47 and is produced by metastatic cancer cells. "It showed us that CD47 and thrombospondin are clearly key players because eliminating either one gives you the same effect." Their suspicions were confirmed: TAX2 preserved T-cell function and slowed down tumor progression in mice with melanoma or colorectal tumors. "We used the TAX2 peptide as a proof-of-concept to confirm that disrupting the crosstalk between TSP-1 and CD47 prevents T cell exhaustion in mice with tumors," said Dr. Chien-Huan (Gil) Weng, an instructor in pharmacology and the study's lead author. Targeting this interaction would be a valuable therapeutic on its own, but it could also help preserve tumor-reactive T cells in patients who would otherwise develop resistance to the currently available T cell-based immune checkpoint inhibitors. Even more promising, experiments in preclinical tumor models suggest that blocking both PD1 and CD47 produces T cells that are more effective at killing cancer cells, Dr. Merghoub said. Thrombospondin-1–CD47 signaling contributes to the development of T cell exhaustion in cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Veterans with Gulf War Illness experienced significant improvement in migraine symptoms after following a diet low in glutamate, a component of flavor enhancing food additives commonly found in processed foods, according to new research presented by Georgetown University and American University scientists. Because cortical thickening has previously been linked to migraines more broadly, the study also suggests that a low-glutamate diet could provide relief to a much larger population. This was exciting, because it shows that the brain itself is responding and changing. Gulf War Illness is a chronic condition affecting more than a quarter of veterans who served in the first Gulf War. It can cause an array of debilitating musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and neurologic symptoms, including migraines, and is thought to be caused by exposure to neurotoxic chemicals during the war. The new research, which was funded by the Department of Defense (DOD W81XWH1710457), grew out of a collaboration with Kathleen Holton, PhD, MPH, a nutritional neuroscientist at American University, who developed the low-glutamate diet and has been researching it as an approach to managing neurological conditions. The low-glutamate diet is currently being studied in a large multi-site clinical trial to confirm these findings in patients with Gulf War Illness. "This was an exciting opportunity to see if we can do something for these veterans who have literally been suffering since the 1990s," VanMeter said. For the study, researchers first used brain scans to compare differences in cortical thickness between patients with Gulf War Illness and a group of healthy patients. Those with Gulf War Illness had a significantly thicker right visual cortex. After a month, scans showed that cortical thickness in this group was significantly reduced. Holton said the findings support the team's theory that glutamate may be contributing to the symptoms of Gulf War Illness by driving excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in the brain; and that these three processes then continue to trigger each other in an ongoing cycle. "We think this is one of the reasons people who are susceptible to dietary glutamate tend to have prolonged symptoms over time," she explained. The researchers noted that other symptoms also improved in the low-glutamate group, including significant reductions in widespread pain, fatigue, mood issues, and cognitive dysfunction. The team plans to publish additional findings from their current ongoing study. While not universal, thickening of the visual cortex, part of the brain linked to vision, is common among migraine sufferers, especially those whose migraines occur with aura, or visual disturbances. That raises the question of whether a low-glutamate diet could also benefit the wider population of migraine sufferers, potentially even as an alternative to medication, VanMeter said. Holton noted that the study also adds to a growing body of evidence about how ultra-processed foods impact health. "This speaks to the fact that diet can not only make us sick, but can also acutely treat our symptoms," she said. Follow-up research is underway to expand on the findings and investigate if weakening of the blood-brain barrier plays a role in glutamate sensitivity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oxytocin administration, when combined with instructed positive interaction with a partner and physical intimacy, improved wound healing in couples in a randomized trial. “These modest, context-dependent effects provide preliminary insights into the neuroendocrine mechanisms through which intimate relationships can improve health, underscoring the need for larger, more diverse trials,” they noted, adding that the data “support the view that oxytocin functions as a social amplifier rather than a standalone therapeutic.” The study was led by Ekaterina Schneider, PhD, Institute of Medical Psychology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, and was published online on November 12 in JAMA Psychiatry. Wound healing assessment was limited to only 24 hours and 7 days post-wounding; the PAT had incomplete adherence at 68% and lacked standardized timing. The study population was restricted to young, healthy, heterosexual couples, limiting generalizability to other demographics. Additionally, the beliefs about group assignment were only indirectly assessed, and intimacy measures lacked standardized definitions. The study was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new evidence review reveals how everyday mushrooms can nudge cardiometabolic markers in the right direction and even prime frontline immune defenses, offering a simple, whole-food strategy for healthier meals. Review: Mushroom consumption impacts on biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease risk and immune function: a narrative review from a whole food perspective. In a recent review published in the journal Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, a group of authors synthesized human and mechanistic evidence on how the consumption of whole mushrooms influences biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease risk and immune function. One in three adults worldwide will develop cardiovascular disease, stroke, or type 2 diabetes mellitus. For many families, warning signs such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, creeping fasting plasma glucose, and higher blood pressure often emerge through ordinary meals, long commutes, and tight budgets. Mushrooms are unusual “other vegetables”: low in energy but rich in fiber, potassium, selenium, B vitamins, beta-glucan, chitin, and L-ergothioneine. These features make them easy swaps for part of meat or refined starch in daily cooking. Further research is needed to clarify the causal effects, optimal amounts, species differences, and the limited evidence base regarding the consumption of mushrooms within an overall healthy dietary pattern. Mushrooms are fungi, not plants, bringing a distinct package of nutrients and bioactives that complement common vegetables. When exposed to ultraviolet light, mushrooms produce vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), which is beneficial in areas with low sun exposure. In kitchens, their natural glutamate and 5′-ribonucleotides contribute to the umami flavor, allowing home cooks to reduce salt and saturated fat without compromising flavor, which is particularly beneficial for families concerned about blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Across human research included in this narrative synthesis, 22 original studies (16 experimental and 6 observational) assessed mushrooms as part of either a “self-chosen diet” (where people incorporated mushrooms into their existing habits) or a “healthy dietary pattern” emphasizing minimally processed, vegetable-rich foods. Experimental doses typically ranged from 13 to 300 grams per day (wet weight), far higher than the average public intake of about 1.4–1.6 kilograms per year (≈approximately 4 grams per day) in the United States. Outcomes commonly tracked included low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP, an inflammation biomarker), and salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA, an immune biomarker). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were generally small and short, so consistency matters more than single p-values. In self-chosen diets, consuming mushrooms consistently reduced serum triglycerides, with neutral effects on HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and CRP. When mushrooms were consumed as part of a healthier overall dietary pattern, fasting plasma glucose levels decreased in the single healthy dietary pattern trial available, plausibly through fiber-mediated, slower carbohydrate absorption and improved satiety. Limited evidence also suggests potential improvements in blood pressure, though results remain preliminary. Culinary strategies, such as “blend-and-extend” meat and mushroom mixtures, can reduce meal energy, sodium, and saturated fat; however, these are culinary applications rather than outcomes demonstrated in the reviewed human trials. Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was not universally measured; however, mechanistic expectations (fiber, potassium, and L-ergothioneine effects on glycemia, endothelial stress, and oxidative balance) align with the observed trends. Importantly, no signs of harm were observed for any biomarker assessed. Immune outcomes are practical when they translate into fewer infections or better vaccine responses; intermediate markers help us get there. Several studies reported increases in salivary IgA after regular mushroom intake. For systemic inflammation, CRP findings were largely neutral in self-chosen diets; heterogeneity in species, dose, and duration likely contributed to this result. Mechanistically, mushroom polysaccharides (notably beta-glucan and chitin) can activate pattern-recognition receptors on innate immune cells, “training” immunity without provoking excessive cytokine release. L-ergothioneine may support the glutathione (GSH) system and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), potentially lowering oxidative stress that sustains chronic inflammation. Mushrooms provide nutrients that many diets lack: fiber (for microbiome and glycemic control), potassium (for blood pressure), and L-ergothioneine (essentially unique to fungi). Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) can be meaningful in winter or for indoor workers if packs are labeled “ultraviolet-exposed.” For households, one can start small but frequently. Add 75–100 grams on most days, sliced into weekday curries, stir-fries, eggs, or sandwiches, or use mushrooms to substitute for part of the meat in patties, tacos, or pasta sauces for culinary and nutritional benefits, while preserving savor. Choose mixtures you enjoy; adherence is better than perfection. Schools, hospitals, and canteens can “blend-and-extend” meat dishes by replacing a portion of the meat with mushrooms to reduce sodium and saturated fat while maintaining acceptance and controlling costs. By framing mushrooms as familiar whole foods rather than pills or powders, they can further improve trust and uptake. Across human studies, whole mushroom consumption appears safe and practically useful, with consistent reductions in triglycerides on self-chosen diets, lower fasting plasma glucose in a single healthy dietary pattern trial, limited but positive evidence for blood pressure improvements, and early signals of improved salivary IgA levels. Effects on LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and CRP are generally neutral; importantly, no adverse biomarker effects were identified. Given their fiber, potassium, L-ergothioneine, and potential vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), mushrooms fit seamlessly into everyday meals and institutional menus. Larger, longer RCTs should define causal impacts, optimal doses, and species differences, and clarify the effects of consuming mushrooms within an overall healthy dietary pattern.
