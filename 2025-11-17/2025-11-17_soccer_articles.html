                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After losing their first two FIFA Club World Cup matches by a combined 16-0 score, semi-pro side Auckland City FC drew Boca Juniors 1-1 behind a goal from Christian Gray, who moonlights as a physical education teacher and youth football coach outside his football career. In an exclusive interview, he shares insights from the tournament and the grind of being a semi-professional footballer. What do these players all have in common? But out of the 130 players who scored at last summer's tournament, only one was an amateur footballer: Christian Gray. Having injured his groin in his final match in New Zealand before flying across the Pacific, Gray was absent for Auckland City's warmup fixtures and their 10-0 defeat to Bayern Munich in Cincinnati, before coming on for the final quarter-hour of the club's 6-0 demolition to Benfica in Orlando. With Auckland City already eliminated after two matches, manager Paul Posa decided to experiment and give Gray the start on the right side of their central defensive trio in their final group stage match against Boca Juniors. It could have easily not happened the way it did, but that just happens to be that the way it worked out,” said Gray in an exclusive Urban Pitch interview. Boca Juniors knew that they could book their ticket to the Round of 16 with a lopsided victory, and when they opened the scoring within 26 minutes, all signs pointed to yet another beatdown in Nashville. Instead, Auckland held firm and escaped halftime with a 1-0 deficit, before taking the lead after the break as Gray headed home from a corner kick. Going up against legendary striker Edinson Cavani and other key figures like Carlos Palacios and Miguel Merentiel, Gray held his own with a disciplined display, making 12 clearances and two recoveries, blocking a shot, completing 11 out of 15 passes, and leading Auckland to one of the greatest upsets in the history of the Club World Cup: a 1-1 draw vs. Boca. While Boca's players have gone back to the glory of playing for one of the most storied clubs in football, Auckland's have returned to their day jobs. For Auckland captain Mario Ilich, that's working as a Coca-Cola sales representative. He started at his school as the football coach three years ago, and started teaching PE this year. Born in the Gisborne Region of New Zealand, Gray is the son of Sandra Edge, who won a gold medal in the 1987 World Netball Championships in Glasgow as well as a silver and a bronze medal with New Zealand in the following two editions. After starting off as a striker, Gray followed in his dad's footsteps and launched his career as a center back. He played for several semi-pro teams across New Zealand incluidng Waitakere United and Eastern Suburbs before eventually joining Auckland City in 2022. Unlike New Zealand's sole two professional teams, Wellington Phoenix and Auckland FC, who play in Australia's league and are thus banned from competing in Asian and Oceanian competitions, Auckland City have been able to form a domestic and continental dynasty. Auckland have won 10 New Zealand Football Championships, including last year's edition, as well as 13 OFC Champions League titles, including the last four. As a result of their unrelenting dominance in Oceania's premier football competition, Auckland have competed in more FIFA Club World Cups (12) than any other team in world football, winning the bronze medal in 2014, before losing their next six matches in the competition by a combined 17-3 margin, the last of which being a 6-2 demolition in the rebranded 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup at the hands of Al Ain. The annual Intercontinental Cup was introduced in order to make way for a revamped, quadrennial FIFA Club World Cup, the inaugural edition being in 2025 in the United States. Instead of just one game, Auckland were going to get the chance to prove themselves in at least three different games in an expanded tournament. Despite missing quite a few of of their players who were unable to secure annual leave from their jobs, and despite losing to Bayern and Benfica by a combined 16-0 score, they managed to hold their own against one of the biggest teams in world football in Boca and headed home with their heads held high. “We had an opportunity after the Boca game to mingle with some of their fans, and obviously they're disappointed at the result, but they could appreciate us,” Gray said. We're not normal players, we work 9-5s, and so I think that makes us relatable in that sense, and the Boca fans were cool with us.” Since that historic stalemate, Auckland have had middling results, currently sitting in sixth place in the New Zealand National League. With all the different competitions, it's been a busy run of fixtures for Auckland, and for Gray, it's been made even more complicated with his challenging work schedule. “There's times where you don't get the right amount of sleep, because you've got to get out for work in the morning and can't get to the gym as often as you'd like. Any spare time we have, the boys will try to get to the gym, or look after themselves a bit, but I guess that's the reality for us, having to work outside of football.” Gray wakes up at 5 a.m. before coaching his junior side from 6:30 to 8, followed by teaching physical education and health at Auckland Grammar School and Mt. And on the weekends, he'll find the time to squeeze in online lectures as he studies for a graduate diploma. Gray is set to graduate from his one-year program and become a registered teacher in December. “I think I've always had many different kinds of commitments, I haven't solely focused on playing professionally, or playing football full-time…I've always enjoyed doing different things,” Gray said. “I've got many different passions, and I guess that's maybe a reason for me not solely pursuing football as a career. I've studied a couple different degrees now, and I've been involved coaching junior and youth football for 10 years now.” As he approaches 29 years of age, Gray has already traveled across the world, gone up against legendary footballers like Cavani, Karim Benzema, and Angel Di Maria, and earned cult hero status thanks to his iconic goal against Boca. But while he's followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a top-quality center back in New Zealand, he hasn't managed to replicate his feat of playing for the New Zealand national team. He recognizes that, in order to get a chance with the All Whites, Gray would likely have to depart Auckland and make the move to a professional club. Despite being comfortable with his current role at Auckland, where he has emerged as a vital cog in central defense and a regular source of goals, Gray hasn't ruled out challenging himself at the professional level. I've been playing in Auckland and domestically for over the last 10 years, so it'd be cool to experience another competition or football in another part of the world.” Most are in Spanish or Portuguese so I don't understand. ⁠I liked all of the stadiums we played in at the Club World Cup especially Geodis Park in Nashville.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United reportedly rejected the chance to sign Chelsea midfielder Romeo Lavia as part of a proposed swap deal for Alejandro Garnacho during the summer. Manchester United allowed Garnacho to join Chelsea in August after the winger fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim, agreeing a deal worth £40m. United assessed the offer but ultimately turned it down due to concerns surrounding Lavia's prolonged battle with fitness issues. The Liverpool-target-turned-Chelsea-signing has endured repeated setbacks since arriving at Stamford Bridge, meaning United felt he would not provide the reliable midfield upgrade needed. The Argentine winger struggled to make an immediate mark at Chelsea despite featuring regularly early in the campaign; however, he has picked up form recently. United's refusal to move for Lavia stemmed largely from the club's growing frustration with persistent midfield instability. Senior figures inside Old Trafford recognise the need for a dedicated defensive midfielder who can provide structure, control and reliable availability. Casemiro's age and physical decline have increased the urgency to identify a long-term successor capable of anchoring Amorim's system at a high level. Without such a figure, United have been forced into makeshift solutions that compromise tactical balance. Bruno Fernandes has dropped deeper to partner Casemiro, reducing his creative influence in attacking zones where he has historically been most impactful. In that context, Lavia's profile, a deeper, possession-based midfielder with Premier League experience, naturally held appeal. However, the defining concern for United was his track record of lengthy injury absences, which threatened to leave them no better prepared for the future than before. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Lavia's Chelsea tenure has been dominated by physical setbacks since his £58m ($76m) move from Southampton in 2023. After arriving with huge expectations, he missed large stretches of the season due to a hamstring problem suffered in training, delaying his debut for months. Lavia has never completed a full 90-minute match for Chelsea, and his total competitive playing time remains extraordinarily low for a player of his profile and price tag. This season, he was ruled out again after sustaining a quadriceps injury in the Champions League against Qarabag. His talent, however, remains clear: press-resistant, intelligent, and proactive in defensive duels, with an impressive passing range for a player his age. Chelsea still believe he can grow into a midfield cornerstone once his body stabilises. For now, though, his availability continues to be a major concern. Manchester United continue to prioritise the recruitment of a specialist holding midfielder who fits both their tactical plan and durability criteria. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba mentioned as potential signings for the summer of 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United are monitoring AZ Alkmaar sensation Kees Smit as they look to finally address their long-standing midfield issues, but face rival interest from within the Premier League. The 19-year-old Dutch international is attracting interest from multiple elite clubs, with AZ prepared to demand around £25 million for their prized academy graduate. Manchester United have identified Smit as a potential solution to their midfield rebuild, as per CentreDevils, with sources confirming that scouts have been closely monitoring the AZ Alkmaar starlet's development this season. His age, tactical intelligence and technical quality make him an attractive long-term investment for a club beginning to reshape its spine. AZ are understood to value the player at roughly £25 million ($33m), a figure widely regarded as modest given his projection and growing international pedigree. Newcastle are pushing hardest alongside United in the race, with their interest described as "gathering serious momentum". Despite United's growing desire to strengthen early, a January move looks unlikely at this stage. United's midfield issues have been evident for several seasons, arising from a blend of ageing personnel and uneven squad construction. Casemiro will turn 34 next year and has begun to show physical decline, occasionally leaving the defence exposed. Meanwhile, Bruno Fernandes has often been forced into unfamiliar roles as cover inside the double pivot. Kobbie Mainoo remains the club's most exciting midfield talent, but his limited minutes this campaign underline United's need to protect young players rather than rely on them to paper over structural gaps. With Mainoo potentially heading out on loan for developmental reasons, the squad risks a further drop in depth. Smit is widely regarded as one of the finest midfielders to emerge from AZ's academy, a system that has consistently produced intelligent, technically excellent talents. At just 19, he already demonstrates a level of composure and decision-making beyond many established professionals. Operating primarily as a deep-lying midfielder, Smit excels in reading play, shielding the back line and dictating tempo with exceptional passing range. His ability to play both short and progressive long balls makes him the central hub for AZ's build-up phases. Because of this, comparisons have been drawn with fellow Dutch orchestrators such as Frenkie de Jong - though Smit boasts a more naturally defensive instinct. Manchester United must decide whether to advance negotiations quickly or risk a rival outmanoeuvring them. With Newcastle already stepping up their approach and big European clubs circling, hesitation could prove costly. A summer move currently appears the most realistic scenario, giving United time to free up squad space, resolve outgoing uncertainties and refine their long-term midfield blueprint. AZ will hold firm on their valuation, knowing demand continues to rise with every standout performance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After the U.S. men's national team defeated Paraguay 2-1 Saturday night, another matchup between Concacaf and CONMEBOL teams took place considerably further away, in Torreón, Mexico. The hot and humid temperatures matched the aggressive nature that both sides displayed during a friendly that nearly reached a boiling point – and issued a warning for any U.S. players expecting anything less than an intense 90 minutes ahead. Within five minutes, the game's first studs-up challenge took place. Mexican players Hirving Lozano and Marcel Ruíz both led with their boots high as Uruguayan winger Brian Rodríguez slid in to play the ball. Lozano's reckless vigor was duly noted by the Uruguayans. One quick body feint wrong-footed Uruguay fullback Guillermo Varela, who then intentionally used his knee as a battering ram to take Lozano out. Minutes later, Lozano angrily used his own right knee to jab Uruguay's Rodrigo Zalazar's thigh. Mexico captain Edson Álvarez raked his right cleat over the top of Mathias Olivera's right foot, in an attempt to win the ball and to let Olivera know his intentions in midfield. It was an obvious red card-level offense that Panamanian referee Fernando Javier Morón merely cautioned with a yellow. When Nandez realized he had gotten away with it, he approached Mora to apologize, who was on the ground writhing in pain. But Nandez's tap on Mora's shoulder showed little remorse for the violent tackle. Mexico's bench spilled out onto the field in the 87th minute after Mexico defender Cesar Montes and Uruguay attacker Maximiliano Araujo tangled on the ground after a would-be penalty in Uruguay's box went uncalled. Neither Mexico nor Uruguay can claim innocence on the night. Both teams toed the line with fouls that were clear yellow card warnings, and a few that could've resulted in a sending off. But for both Mexico and Uruguay, valuable lessons were learned. Mexico, winless in its last five matches under Javier Aguirre, played with intensity and showed a willingness to suffocate the opposition's build-up play. Uruguay will rue yet another match without a goal. The South Americans have failed to score in nine of their last 15 games. Head coach Marcelo Bielsa blamed himself but said that he was surprised by his side's overall performance. “I expected more than Uruguay and less from Mexico,” he said. Uruguay is still a very gritty team whose mind games, or dark arts, are amongst the most cunning in world football. It'll be something that the Argentine will have no problem emphasizing. Uruguay remains very sound defensively and is still one of game's great underdog stories. La Celeste represent a country of roughly 3.5 million people that for decades has produced thick-skinned football heroes and trophy-laden national teams. Today, their striker room lacks the star power of the past when Luis Suárez, Diego Forlán and Edinson Cavani starred internationally. Former Liverpool striker Darwin Nuñez, now with Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal, is not in this camp due to a knee injury. That has forced Bielsa to rely on 31-year-old Rodrigo Aguirre at the lone No. Pochettino has spent many hours as U.S. head coach trying to gradually instill some of the passion that he identifies with as an Argentine on this U.S. team that began his tenure with a clear personality. After the win over Paraguay, some U.S. players revealed that an antagonistic attitude is encouraged by their head coach, especially against opposition that may seek a psychological advantage. I think we embody that,” said U.S. defender Max Arfsten on Saturday. “These games are gritty and physical, I think this plays into our identity.” The match, of course, was marred by a late-game skirmish between both benches. “Anything can happen, I don't like this type of situation.” U.S. goalkeeper Matt Freese accused the Paraguayans of delivering “a few cheap shots.” U.S. captain Tim Ream said, “It shows that guys are in it, willing to protect each other, wanting to get involved.” He added that not getting “pushed around” was an objective against a typically tough-tackling Paraguay team. On Tuesday in Florida, that newfound U.S. bravado will clash against the famed garra charrúa of Uruguay. Bielsa expects better from his men and will certainly retool his starting XI with the inclusion of a few first-team players who sat out against Mexico. Bielsa said on Saturday night that Uruguay's less-than-convincing performance wasn't due to a lack of preparation or effort. He blamed his approach and pre-match vision for the Mexico match. Even though his ideas have been fully embraced by the current squad, Bielsa said they're still chasing the ideal style of play. By shielding his players, Bielsa sought to maintain their natural fighting spirit intact for Tuesday's date against the U.S. Pochettino's men will have to be careful to not let their emotions spill over, or at the very least, refrain from any more bench-clearing tussles in the name of machismo. In a World Cup setting, patriotism and heart can be difference makers, but when passion is mistaken for belligerence, the consequences can be severe.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Talks between the club and Coronel over a new deal did not reach an agreement and the parties will part ways. Coronel is out of contract at the end of December and is eligible for MLS free agency. Coronel, 28, made 180 appearances for RBNY, an anchor for the club's playoff run to reach MLS Cup last winter, where they fell to the LA Galaxy. The Paraguayan international has nine caps for his country, starting the first six matches in World Cup qualifying. Paraguay secured qualification to the 2026 World Cup in September. The Red Bulls acquired veteran goalkeeper John McCarthy from the LA Galaxy this summer and gave him a new contract. Following that tournament, Stokes travelled to RB Leipzig for a training stint.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The forward brought a remarkable flare and flash and plenty of hardware to her storied legacy with the team. She is now being honored as receiving induction into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in her first year of eligibility. She just recently announced her retirement and then appeared on the player's ballot. It was quickly voted on that she would be selected. It should come as no surprise to many who followed her career. In addition to her time representing her country, she won three national titles at the University of North Carolina and twice earned a ring as a member of the Portland Thorns in the NWSL. Throughout her career she dazzled both spectators and teammates with how she handled the ball anytime it came her way. She scored in her first two games back against Mexico. It kicked off a bronze medal the 2021 Olympics in Japan. She has been a great ambassador for both women's soccer and women's sports as a whole. Together with her wife and fellow National Team soccer star, Christen Press, she has founded Re-Inc. Its aim is to rebrand and have an inclusive environment for all sports and genders. Never more apparent than in the match against Sweden. In a 2-0 victory for the United States was named the Player of the Match for "Tireless running and a forcing goal to seal victory". It was a perfect way to describe an exciting player who now will be forever remembered in the Hall of Fame.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino has called for fans to step up their support of the U.S men's national team as preparations for the 2026 FIFA World Cup continue—specifically by attending games in greater numbers in order to build a closer bond with the players. After beating Paraguay 2–1 in Chester, Pennsylvania to open the November international window, the Argentine manager pleaded with fans to care more intensely in the lead-up to next summer's tournament. In Spain, the same,” Pochettino said to reporters post-match. “In every country, it's the same. So we need our fans to follow and support the national team. We need to build that relationship.” At the same time, several fans also took to online platforms to share their concerns about ticket prices, which have been a consistent sticking point for many supporters. That's the most important,” Pochettino continued. If we're able to attract our fans to support us, we can create a very good [relationship] between us and be very, very strong.

In September, in a flustered press conference that followed a 2–0 loss to South Korea at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J.—in front of a largely pro-Korean crowd—he begged Americans to “please come” to support the national team in the lead-up to next year's tournament. That match marked the final loss before the USMNT embarked on their current five-game undefeated run.
