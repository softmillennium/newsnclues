                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristian Garin joined a six-way tie for a season-leading four Challenger titles on Sunday when he won the Uruguay Open in Montevideo. Buse would have made his Top 100 debut in the PIF ATP Rankings had he triumphed. But the 29-year-old Garin spoiled Buse's hopes and claimed his eighth Challenger title. His three previous trophies this year came in Mauthausen, Oeiras and on home soil in Antofagasta. "Proud of the effort and already looking ahead to what's next," Garin wrote in an Instagram post reflecting on his 2025 season. "Thank you to everyone who supported me. Garin, seeded fifth in Montevideo, rallied from a set down in his final three matches of the week. German Jan-Lennard Struff lifted his seventh trophy at that level with a title run at the ALL IN OPEN Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes in Lyon.

Kozlov claims first title since 2021, fittingly at same tournament American Stefan Kozlov captured his first Challenger title in four years by triumphing at the Paine Schwartz Partners Challenger — the same event he won back in 2021. The 27-year-old saved a match point in his quarter-final against Darwin Blanch and rode that momentum through the final, claiming a 7-6(3), 7-5 victory against former Arizona State University standout Murphy Cassone. Glinka, 25, becomes third Estonian Challenger champion Daniil Glinka became the third Estonian player (Mark Lajal, Jurgen Zopp) to win a Challenger title with his maiden title at the Challenger Banque Nationale de Drummondville.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Nitto ATP Finals title match between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday became the most-watched tennis broadcast in Italian television history. Over 6.7 million viewers watched on linear TV alone, with the combined total across linear and digital reaching 7.008 million. Sinner defeated Alcaraz 7-6(4), 7-5 and successfully defended his Turin crown — surpassing the previous national record of 6.6 million set during Sinner's final showdown with Novak Djokovic at the season finale in 2023. The new benchmark not only underscores Sinner's status as a national sporting icon but also the surging momentum behind tennis viewership in Italy, helped by the likes of fellow stars Lorenzo Musetti, Flavio Cobolli and Luciano Darderi. It marked their sixth meeting in 2025, which have all come in finals, including in the past three majors. Sinner, who trails Alcaraz 6-10 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, extended his indoor winning streak to 31 matches, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. His last defeat in these conditions came to Djokovic — the previous most-watched tennis broadcast in Italian television history. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ATP and Nitto Denko Corporation have today announced a multi-year extension of their highly successful partnership. Guided by its ambition to be a top ESG company, Nitto continues to drive innovation at the Nitto ATP Finals, pioneering a range of social and environmental initiatives. Highlights include the Nitto ATP Finals Innovation Summit, an annual conference bringing together thought leaders to explore solutions to sustainability challenges, and the Nitto ATP Finals Torino Green Project, a collaboration between Nitto, FITP, and the City of Turin, aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and promoting environmental sustainability within the host city. Nitto has also invited children and families from U.G.I. Eno Polo, ATP CEO, said: “Nitto has been our trusted partner for almost a decade now. Their commitment to the Nitto ATP Finals has helped make it what it is today – a world-class experience for both fans and players. Their impact doesn't stop there – they've fully embraced sustainability, leading the way in building an event that drives real, positive change.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even in the midst of a standout 2025 on the ATP Tour, Jannik Sinner and his team knew that improvements were always possible. The Italian crowned his season in style on Sunday night in Turin, where he overcame his great rival Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets to successfully defend his title at the Nitto ATP Finals. A key feature of Sinner's trophy run at the prestigious season finale was his serve, and his coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi later reflected on the recent work they had done with that aspect of the World No. “For sure after the US Open we saw some issues, especially with the serve,” said Vagnozzi at Inalpi Arena after Sinner's 7-6(4), 7-5 final triumph. He served really well from Shanghai until here. Today in the second set he struggled a little bit. “I think Carlos changed his position on the second serve, changed something on the serve of Jannik also. The second set he started to serve too slow. You May Also Like: It all adds up for Sinner at the Nitto ATP Finals, Italian defeats Alcaraz for title “Jannik and Simone have done some incredible work over the last four or five weeks to rejig the serve and find that rhythm and tempo where he has been able to up the first-serve percentage. “It is not just that about the first-serve percentage. If we were really concerned about the first-serve percentage, we would let him slow the serve down to let him get more first serves in. He's actually pumped up the miles per hour, and he is getting the ball closer to the line, which means he gets a lot more free points. They've done a wonderful job with that.” After his final defeat to Alcaraz in New York, Sinner lifted ATP 500 titles in Beijing and Vienna, an ATP Masters 1000 crown in Paris, and the Nitto ATP Finals trophy. Sinner's Turin victory against Alcaraz, in which he saved a set point in the first set and rallied from 1-3 to clinch the second, reduced his Lexus ATP Head2Head deficit against the Spaniard to 6-10. Vagnozzi was delighted with the way his charge had held his nerve in front of thousands of adoring home fans. “We are really happy about Jannik's performance. I think there is still something to work on also after this win, the match showed something that we can try to make better. But I'm really happy how we finished the season with unbelievable three tournaments in a row. We are pumped to start next season.” No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>
