                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Based on the successful movie franchise, the eerie ghost tale relies on special effects and mood to make audience members scream, faint, and jump into their partner's lap. Just don't try to follow the plot. Lou obsesses over a podcast led by mystical medium Etheline Cotgrave (Kate Fry), desperate to discover why she feels so haunted. She hears voices, sees objects move, and believes that evil followed them to England. James grapples with the dread that his wife has gone insane, while feeling the burden from his pushy mother (Shannon Cochran) to conceive a grandchild. Director Felix Barrett and writer Levi Holloway have devised a crackerjack nightmare for an entire audience to eyewitness. The play starts with Smashing Pumpkins blasting through the Ahmanson (a bit too loudly, so bring ear plugs). The curtain opens to Fly Davis's vast two-story set with doors hiding secrets and lies. Gareth Fry's sound design features banshee shrieks and ominous warnings. Anna Watson's lighting makes a quaint cottage into The Amityville Horror, with smoke, flickering lights, and a window that tracks headlights making spooky visions in the darkest of rooms. But the main course is the litany of effects by video designer Luke Halls and illusionist Chris Fisher. Without revealing any of the surprises ahead, it can be said that audience members will spend all night wide-eyed awake, desperate to figure out how they possibly saw what they know they saw. Holloway's script is confounding and one has to just let it wash over them. There are plot holes that the entire house could fall through, and twists that turn other facts into quicksand. Thankfully, one does not go to horror for Shakespearean construction. Álvarez and Heusinger convey two people too frayed to sleep or even breathe. Fry is delightful as a countryside psychic, one who has seen everything, but still would like a nice cup of tea with her exorcism. Cochran is relatable as the mother from hell, one who knows where that line is, but crosses willfully because she believes every comment in her head warrants being expressed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That their theories of full-on corruption in the upper spheres where power lives are valid. That the “Eyes Wide Shut“ cabal of political and financial interests married to sinister sexual deviance depicted in Stanley Kubrick's 1999 film is not, in fact, fiction. So often journalists like myself attempt to demonstrate to family members and voters in the far reaches of the country, away from centers of power and money, that their conspiracies are false. They suggest that in fact there is a widespread code among people with power and money who support one another. They are pals no matter what side of the aisle. Leave aside, for a moment, Donald Trump's involvement in any of this. His name appears more than 1,600 times in the email release, according to a Wall Street Journal review, and we all know how hard he's fighting to keep the files from the Department of Justice investigation from being released. Epstein's email pals range across the landscape of the politics and trip across business, media, tech, academia and society, from former Harvard president and U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to former White House Democratic counsel Kathy Ruemmler. From MAGA dark knight Steve Bannon to prime ministers across northern Europe and Gulf oil dignitaries. They include chummy conversations with a New Age health guru Deepak Chopra and a New York PR fixer Peggy Siegel, with a New York Times journalist Landon Thomas Jr, a Bonfire of the Vanities simulacrum Michael Wolff – and Harvard literature professor and poet Elisa Lew, whom Epstein gave a $500,000 donation for her TV project, “Poetry in America.” In an email, she recommended he read “Lolita” by Nabokov, “a man whose whole life is stamped forever by his impression of a young girl.” (No, I am not making this up. And — just a guess — Epstein was probably already familiar with the novel.) The emails include real-time texting with US Virgin Islands Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett while she was soliciting public testimony from former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, live on C-SPAN. “Great outfit,” he texted her during the 2019 hearing, later advising: “Cohen brought up RONA — keeper of the secrets,” referring to Rhona Graff, Trump's longtime executive assistant, before pushing her to ask about other “henchmen” in the Trump organization. At the time these emails were being exchanged, Epstein had already pleaded guilty to procuring a girl younger than 18 for prostitution and sentenced to 18 months in prison (serving only partially). By the 2010s he was back in the saddle, with dinner invitations accepted, his private jet sought after — and apparently his friendship and advice. In March 2019, Summers whined to Epstein that a woman had “blown off” a weekend plan and complained about “being the friend without benefits.” Epstein replied with his best dating advice:  “She's smart … making you pay for past errors … you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring … no whining showed strength.” Just a few months after this exchange, Epstein was arrested again, this time by the feds, on charges of sex trafficking. I asked Brown if she thought the emails validated those who believed in wacky Pizzagate-style theories (where Hillary Clinton was bizarrely accused of participating in a pedophile ring). (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Epstein — that was a conspiracy,” she said. “And that's exactly the way they should be looked at. People who have money and power get away with crimes. [The email trove] shows that people are willing to overlook even the worst crime if they think that somehow they're going to benefit.” The swamp is specifically what Donald Trump promised to clean up. But these emails suggest a much wider group of elites who accepted Epstein as fine company. You remember the scene in “Eyes Wide Shut” when Tom Cruise finds that weird orgy mansion with masks and creepy rituals? It's the deep state network depicted in “One Battle After Another” with sex instead of racism as the social glue. That regular people cannot get access to the byways of power or, eventually, money. I used to scoff at the notion that there was a vast conspiracy of men — from public figures to shadowy spooks — who trafficked in women across the world. The question is: What are we going to do about it?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The composition of interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS has been puzzling scientists for four months. While some believe it is a comet racing through the Solar System at 130,000mph, leading theoretical physicist Avi Loeb has suggested it could be an alien 'mothership'. UFO enthusiasts think it could be extraterrestrials attempting to make first contact. SpaceX boss Musk told the Joe Rogan Experience podcast that while it may be an unusual comet or asteroid it 'could be alien - I don't know'. That is the date scientists believe it will come closest to Earth. They believe it will get no nearer than 170 million miles away. But Musk cautioned space chiefs must continue to monitor its approach in case it strays from its predicted flight path, reports the Daily Star. It marks only the third confirmed visitor from beyond our solar system, following 2017's 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov two years later. When it reached its closest point to the Sun on October 30, researchers observed it making non-gravitational accelerations, while a radio signal detected from the object left observers stunned. Professor Loeb stated its 'anomalies' suggest it 'might' be an extraterrestrial spaceship. Its conduct has been so unusual that he indicated he will never be able to dismiss the possibility it is an alien craft. On his UFO scale where zero represents something 'consistent with known natural phenomena' and 10 is of 'confirmed extraterrestrial origin' he stated 3I/Atlas would always at least be a two - an object 'meriting attention'. Telescopes around the globe are monitoring its every movement. British documentary film-maker Mark Christopher Lee has suggested humanity could be on the verge of making first contact with ET in time for Christmas. He has stated: "These are weird times and we've always looked to the stars for guidance – and we need guidance now in 2025. "The UFOlogist in me sees 3I/ATLAS's Earth flyby just before Christmas as no coincidence." "We could detect signals or course changes by December 19 to 25.</p>

This week, the nonprofit Veterans Community Project (VCP) broke ground on its sixth tiny home village, this time in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to offer more military veterans a fresh start with housing and individualized care. Each 240-square-foot home is part of a larger community designed to help residents regain stability and independence. Since its founding in 2018 when they welcomed their first residents in Kansas City, VCP has helped hundreds of vets transition out of homelessness. VCP has set a new standard for how cities can address veteran homelessness, with its 85% success rate for vets who complete the program successfully and transition to sustainable permanent housing—all in an average of 335 days. Army combat veteran Dave Myers ... had never heard of VCP when his life was spinning out of control three years ago, addicted to drugs after returning home from war. He now smiles recalling a judge's words ordering him to become a volunteer after he got clean in prison: “He told me, ‘You're going to spend so much time with these guys that they're either going to love you or hate you ... I hope it's the former, and that they offer you a job after. “I was able to connect with our residents in some ways that not a lot of other people can. I've been in their shoes.” “This place saved me,” he said proudly.</p>
