Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! To kick off our week of coverage from the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, we play video of a major protest that took place Saturday, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the host city Belém to demand urgent climate action. The Indigenous-led action was the first major climate protest at a United Nations climate conference since 2021; protests were banned by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan, the three previous host countries. Demonstrators denounced corporate greed, war and imperialism, while demanding urgent action to reduce use of fossil fuels and to respect Indigenous sovereignty. “The answer is us,” said Lucía Ixchíu, a Maya K'iche' environmental defender. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: We're broadcasting from the U.N. climate summit — that's COP30 — from the Brazilian city of Belém. Leaders and delegates from more than 190 countries have entered a second week of negotiations. The Great People's March was the first major climate protest at a U.N. climate summit since 2021. The three previous climate summits were hosted by nations that ban public actions: Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan. MARÍA INÉS TARACENA: We're in the streets of Belém, where the U.N. climate summit is taking place. We're halfway through the negotiations of CO30. Thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding urgent climate action. We spoke to several of them. I'm here with all the people from world. We have gathered there 30,000 people from 60 countries. We are seeing U.S. right now just launching a new military attempt against Venezuela, against Colombia. There is no peace, there is no possibility of environmental solutions with war, with fossil fuels. We have the diversity of all societies here. So, this is what we are doing here: fight for our life. I am an activist in the peasant women's movement. And we are here at the global march in defense of life, in defense of our territories. And we will not negotiate our rights, because there is no living territory if we are not alive. We will not negotiate our rights. I'm part of the Amazon Flotilla and also Festivales Media in Guatemala. I'm also part of the Yaku Mama Flotilla. We traveled for more than 31 days from the Amazon River from Ecuador to Belém, and we see the ecocide there. So, for us, it's very important to be here and stand together, because we have to take action together for the environmental issue. MARÍA INÉS TARACENA: Why is that sense of solidarity so important, especially among Indigenous leaders from across the region and around the world? LUCÍA IXCHÍU: Well, one of the most important things for me for this COP is the action and the solidarity that we are building together as Indigenous leaders and land defenders from different parts of the world, because we know that the answer is us. And we are making this together. DELMAH WELLINGTON NDHLOVU: My name is Delmah Wellington Ndhlovu from Zimbabwe, a smallholder farmer, a peasant farmer from my country. We feel the power is not equal. And so, we have come to lend our voice to say this is high time it should stop. We are the majority, even in any country. Therefore, we should be considered first. It's for them to leave us, the Tapajós, in peace. That is a sacred place, where we must fight until the end of our lives, until we die, for that river, for the stones, for the rock formations. That place is a legend to us. And I want to tell the government to look out for us, because stop harming us in our region, in our Amazon rainforest. LARISSA SACRAMENTO: Our families are dying. And in our country, we and the nature, we are the same thing. And no, that needs to stop right now. AMAZONIAN ACTIVIST 2: It's just really important to point out that there's a lot of focus in Amazon, in the forest, but there's also a need to focus on the riverine communities, on the quilombola communities, and also on the other communities from other areas that are also guardians of our ecosystem and ecosystems that are very important, like the fisherfolk in the coast and the fisherfolk in the mangroves. So, this is a movement that represents them. We are a global, international network of Indigenous people. We're standing here here with our relatives from the Global South, from the Amazon to speak with one mind and one voice and one heart. We're demanding that all these fossil fuel lobbyists be removed. It's very unethical and immoral that there's more there than the Indigenous people here from the local regions. We have Indigenous people here who have to fight to get in, but we have these corporations that can just walk right in with no struggle. So we're declaring that the rights of Indigenous people be recognized and that there be climate action, action, real solutions. And we have that as Indigenous people. EDWARDS CASTILLO-RODRÍGUEZ: [translated] We are here to denounce the capitalist negotiations in the face of the climate crisis, which never manages to fulfill any agreements for controlling greenhouse gas emissions or establishing carbon sinks. Instead, it's pure capitalist business interests with no results. Climate justice is also necessary, and that implies compensation for the damage caused by the climate crisis, inflicted by capitalism and global imperialism. And, of course, solidarity with the people of Venezuela, who are being threatened with the use of force by a thug in a red tie and blue suit, but who only wants not freedom, not democracy, not humanitarian aid, but to plunder the resources — not only of Venezuela. They want to enter the Amazon through Venezuela, and they're coming to seize all of Latin America. I'm from the Philippines, and I'm with the Peoples Rising for Climate Justice. We're marching with the people of Belém today to demand accountability from the world leaders as they attend COP30. As we can see, a lot of wars and occupations has been happening all over the world, from Palestine to Sudan to Congo and other regions, West Papua and even in Asia. And so we're here demanding for these world leaders, for these imperialist nations to stop the U.S.-led wars, to stop their imperialist dominations over these countries, to stop the food blockades and to stop violating the human rights of those people and the environment. Communities in the Philippines are devastated by flooding and corruption, and those are things that should have been talked about in the COP30. And yet we are seeing false solutions. That's why the movement is here to get their space to demand accountability and to fight back against these world leaders who are dominating the space that should have been for the people and for the environment. GIOVANI DEL PRETE: Why are we on the streets today? Can we answer that question, please? We are tired of false solutions. We are tired of being slaves in our own countries. I believe the power is in us to say no. As we stand together, let the COP know that we are concerned as peasants. MARÍA INÉS TARACENA: From the streets of Belém, this is María Inés Taracena with Democracy Now! AMY GOODMAN: Voices from the streets of Belém, here in Brazil, at Saturday's major Indigenous-led climate protest outside the U.N. climate summit, where we are right now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is no significant relationship between immigration rates and rising housing costs in the US, experts have said. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. In an interview with Fox News last week, Vice President JD Vance downplayed the significance of rising inflation and costs for consumer goods in the U.S., claiming that any price increases are not due to Trump administration policies. Unlike President Donald Trump, Vance recognized that costs were up compared to last year. But he blamed former President Joe Biden for the increases. “A lot of young people are saying, ‘Housing is way too expensive.' Because we flooded the country with 30 million illegal immigrants who are taking houses that ought, by right, go to American citizens,” Vance said. This claim — frequently peddled by Vance and Trump to deflect blame for the state of the economy — is blatantly false, housing and immigration experts say. There is “no significant relationship between unauthorized immigrants and general house price growth for each state in the U.S.,” said a joint study from researchers at Texas A&M and the University of Maine published earlier this year. Furthermore, immigrant workers are essential to the housing supply, making up a crucial segment of the construction workforce that can address shortages and improving housing stock. Christopher J. Calton, a research fellow at a nonpartisan think tank called The Independent, condemned the administration in May for blaming immigrants for rising prices. “The simple truth is that we would have a severe housing shortage even if President Trump were to deport every undocumented immigrant tomorrow,” Calton said, adding that, “the longer we scapegoat immigrants for America's self-imposed housing shortage, the longer it will take us to solve it.” “Greedflation” — when corporations use the effects of inflation to justify increasing prices higher than is necessary in order to make higher profits — also played a role in costs going up. So far in 2025, it appears that inflation is on track to rise by 3.0 percent again. While not a significantly huge increase, the rate change suggests that Vance's arguments about an “inherited” inflation problem are false — if prices were getting better under Trump's watch, that number would be lessening, not growing. What's more, studies demonstrate that Trump's various tariffs have indeed contributed to a rise in retail prices for consumers, amounting to an effective tax rate of about 18 percent on American shoppers, the highest level since 1934. In response to off-year elections earlier this month that saw huge wins for Democrats across the country, Trump insisted that voters were not casting their ballots based on concerns about affordability, describing the concept as a “con job” by Democrats. Instead, Trump said he and Republicans “are the ones that have done great on affordability.” Everything is way down, and the press doesn't report it,” Trump during a White House event nearly two weeks ago. But that claim is false: Grocery store prices, similar to inflation overall, have increased by 2.7 percent since Trump won the 2024 presidential election. Trump also disregarded rising prices in a lengthy Truth Social post over the weekend, writing that he and Republicans  “are winning BIG” on “the Economy” and “Affordability.” Voters, however, do not appear to agree: A Quinnipiac University poll published in mid-October shows that only 38 percent of Americans give the president positive marks on his handling of the economy, while 57 percent said they disapproved of his job performance on the issue.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prominent Ukrainian activist and volunteer Serhii Sternenko criticized his country's military and political leadership on Nov. 17, warning that "we are headed toward a disaster of strategic magnitude, which could lead to the loss of statehood." In an X post accompanied by screenshots of a critical Facebook post by a Ukrainian journalist, Sternenko stressed that remaining silent about the issues with Ukraine's military and political approach to the country's defense "is a crime." "Our defense is falling apart," Sternenko, who works closely with various military units to supply their immediate needs, such as drones, said. Sternenko's warning comes as Russian troops pierce through Ukrainian defenses on multiple hot spot sectors of the war, including Pokrovsk in eastern Donetsk Oblast and near the town of Huliaipole in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast. This year alone, Russia has been able to suddenly open new fronts in areas that were once far from the fighting, such as in Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy oblasts, raising concerns about Ukraine's ability to prepare and build fortifications — and learn from its repeating mistakes. Without significant changes in both the military and political leadership, the possibility of Russian tanks hypothetically reaching cities such as Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia is "only a matter of time," Sternenko warned. There was no immediate reaction from either of the leaderships. The Kyiv Independent reached out to Sternenko but was declined an immediate comment. Asami Terajima is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent covering Ukrainian military issues, front-line developments, and politics. She previously worked as a business reporter for the Kyiv Post focusing on international trade, infrastructure, investment, and energy. Sternenko's warning comes as Russian troops pierce through Ukrainian defenses on multiple hot spot sectors of the war. Poland reopened the Kuznica and Bobrowniki crossings with Belarus after they had been closed for years, citing economic reasons and strengthened security along the eastern frontier. Discounts on Urals relative to Brent reached $23.5 per barrel, the widest gap since June 2023. Zelensky told TF1-LCI news channel that Ukraine aims to buy 100 Dassault-made Rafale fighters, a 4.5-generation multirole aircraft. "Unfortunately, calls about possible victims continue to come in," authorities said. Ukraine has long highlighted Western and foreign components used in Russian weapons to call for tougher sanctions. Kremniy, located in east-central Irkutsk Oblast, is the country's largest refined silicon producer with a yearly capacity of 34,000 tons. "We will catch the perpetrators, whoever they are," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said, noting that the route was "crucially important for delivering aid to Ukraine."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Once the measure passes, it would still need approval in the US Senate, where 13 Republican senators would need to join with all 47 Democrats to approve it. Trump spent last week aggressively squeezing allies in the US House, including Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, to back off in their support of releasing the files. Those efforts were unsuccessful, and when it became apparent the measure was going to pass, Trump backed it in an effort to salvage an embarrassing political loss. “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,” he posted on his Truth Social network on Sunday evening. For years, Trump's Maga base, including people who now have prominent positions in his administration, have called for the release of the Epstein files, suggesting there was a conspiracy to protect the rich and powerful. But earlier this year, the justice department said it had reviewed the files and would not be releasing more documents. That set off more furor and pressure on Trump to release them. The messages also show Trump ally Steve Bannon advising Epstein on how to rehabilitate his image. Epstein further corresponded with other prominent people, including the former treasury secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers; the journalist Michael Wolff; and Kathryn Ruemmler, Barack Obama's former White House counsel. Some Maga influencers have sought to pivot the story away from Trump. Megyn Kelly, the conservative radio host, appeared to question whether Epstein really was a pedophile. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to one count of soliciting an underage prostitute and in 2019 faced federal sex trafficking charges for girls as young as 14. The issue has ignited a bitter split with Marjorie Taylor Greene, a House representative of Georgia, who has increasingly styled herself as someone in touch with the real Maga base and has refused to blindly back Trump through the Epstein saga. “Just release it all, let the American people sort through every bit of it, and, you know, support the victims. Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters Trump repeatedly attacked Greene over the weekend, calling her a “traitor”, amid other insults. “Those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,” she said. Later that evening she posted on social media that she and her family had started receiving hoax pizza deliveries, and that there had been a pipe bomb threat directed at her construction company. But whether Trump's reversal will effectively quell the pressure from his base, or if he'll continue to feel the heat – including from some of his otherwise staunchest allies – will be closely watched.</p>

Among the dead was a seven-year-old girl who was swept into the ocean by waves estimated up to 20ft at a state beach on Friday. The girl's father, 39-year-old Yuji Hu, of Calgary, Alberta, was killed while trying to save his daughter. In northern California, in Sutter county, north of Sacramento, a 71-year-old man died after his vehicle was swept off a flooded bridge. Much further south, a wooden boat believed to have been ferrying migrants toward the US from Mexico capsized in stormy seas off the coast of San Diego, leaving at least four people dead and four hospitalized. Downtown LA saw more rain than any previous November, breaking a record previously set in 1985, the Los Angeles Times reported. On Monday, lingering thunderstorms continued to pose the risk of mudslides in areas of Los Angeles county that were recently ravaged by wildfire. More than 4in of rain fell over coastal Santa Barbara county as the storm approached Los Angeles. Amid the climate crisis, warming oceans are supercharging such atmospheric river storms, making them deadlier and costlier. Atmospheric rivers have long been important features of weather systems across the US west and are vital to replenishing the state's reservoirs and snowpack.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gunmen attacked a government girls' boarding school in Nigeria's Kebbi State early on Monday, killing the vice principal and abducting 25 female students, police said, in the latest mass kidnapping in the country's northwest. The assailants, armed with rifles and reportedly using coordinated tactics, stormed Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga town around 4 a.m. local time, engaging police in a gunfight before scaling the perimeter fence and seizing the students, police spokesperson Nafiu Abubakar Kotarkoshi said. Gunmen who kidnapped 287 school children in Nigeria say they will kill them all if $622,000 ransom not paid Vice Principal Hassan Yakubu Makuku was shot dead while resisting the attackers, and another staff member sustained gunshot injuries, he added. Police said additional tactical units, soldiers and local vigilantes have been deployed to comb suspected escape routes and surrounding forests in a search-and-rescue operation. Northwest Nigeria has witnessed repeated school abductions by armed gangs seeking ransom payments, despite government pledges to improve security in the region. Islamist militant group Boko Haram kidnapped 270 schoolgirls in 2014 in the northeastern town of Chibok. While many of the girls managed to escape or were later released, some have never been returned. This story has been updated. CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine will purchase “up to 100” French-made Rafale fighter jets as well as anti-air defenses and drones from France, the Elysee Palace confirmed, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Paris on Monday. At a news conference, Zelensky told reporters that the deal would include eight air defense systems and six launchers in what he described as an “historic agreement.” Macron said that some of the deliveries of drones, interceptor drones and guided bombs, would come in the “very short term” with manufacturing commitments made for the coming three years. Macron said that Ukraine will receive a “new generation” of the SAMP/T missile interceptor – largely comparable to the US-made Patriot system – which will be available in 2026. This was Zelensky's ninth visit to Paris since the 2022 Russian invasion, as France has become a central pillar of Western support for Ukraine, particularly given the unpredictability of US weapons supplies. In a powerful show of Franco-Ukrainian military cooperation, the leaders inked the agreement in front of a Rafale jet loaded up with guided AASM bombs and beside a SCALP cruise missile that Paris has already supplied to Kyiv. The two leaders were flanked by a SAMP/T missile interceptor system and a GF300 radar system that France has also sent to Ukraine. France has seen broad success exporting the Rafale, including to India. In what has been described as the largest aerial battle of the modern era, India lost one of its Rafale jets in combat with Pakistani forces in May, according to a French intelligence source. The French aviation firm behind the Rafale, Dassault, is looking to boost its production output to four fighter jets per month and the company said it has 233 jets still on order, as of October 7. The agreement signed Monday is merely a letter of intent, still a way off a concrete purchase, spurring questions as to how Ukraine will pay for the French jets when Ukraine signed a letter of understanding  for 100-150 Swedish-made Grippen jets in October. In a letter to European Union members on Monday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggested that Ukraine had three options – independently or in combination – to meet its financing needs. She said these were grants from EU allies, a loan funded by EU borrowing or loan linked to the cash balance of frozen Russian assets, according to Reuters. The Elysee Palace also said that European financing could be used for the purchases as well as financing from frozen Russian assets.</p>

MOSCOW, November 17. /TASS/. Russia has absolutely no supporters whatsoever of any possible confrontation with forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.

"There are no supporters of any confrontation with NATO in Russia, but we must take measures that ensure our interests," Peskov said at a news briefing commenting on a recent statement by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius that a possible war between Russia and NATO could be allegedly unleashed before 2029.

On November 15, in an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Pistorius warned that a confrontation between Russia and NATO might occur before the end of this decade.

The German defense chief stated in particular that: "We have traditionally cited 2029 as a potential timeframe, but current assessments suggest a possibility as early as 2028. Some military analysts contend we may have just experienced our final peaceful summer." He added that NATO maintained "robust deterrence capabilities," including nuclear forces.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HUR said that its list of equipment from Eastern Asian companies is helping Moscow produce a Unified Module for Gliding and Guidance (UMPK) kit for glide bombs, as well as missiles and artillery ammunition. Ukraine has long highlighted Western and foreign components used in Russian weapons to call for tougher sanctions that would make it more difficult for Moscow to circumvent them. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in October, for instance, that the missiles and drones that Russia used to attack Ukraine on Oct. 5 "contained over 100,000 foreign-made components," including those from American, German, and British companies. Japanese Okuma and Chinese Hision machining centers' equipment were included in the newly released data. HUR claimed that Russia's Tactical Missile Armament Corporation is using them to produce planning and correction modules for weapons, such as glide bombs and cruise missiles. Another Japanese machining center, Matsuura Machinery Corporation, was also in the list, with HUR claiming that the company's equipment is helping Russia produce missiles that regularly hit Ukraine, such as Kh-59 and Kh-101. Equipment from Korean Samsung Machine Engineering Company (SMEC) is also used by Russia to produce the external structure for unguided missiles, as well as large and medium caliber shells, according to HUR. Taiwanese AKIRA SEIKI's equipment, HUR claimed, is used by the Russian defense enterprise Burevestnik stabilizers for mortar rounds. Aside from East Asian companies, which also included Chinese ones, the new data released also named three Czech companies and a German company's equipment for aiding Russian weapon production.

Poland reopened the Kuznica and Bobrowniki crossings with Belarus after they had been closed for years, citing economic reasons and strengthened security along the eastern frontier. Discounts on Urals relative to Brent reached $23.5 per barrel, the widest gap since June 2023. Zelensky told TF1-LCI news channel that Ukraine aims to buy 100 Dassault-made Rafale fighters, a 4.5-generation multirole aircraft. "Unfortunately, calls about possible victims continue to come in," authorities said. Ukraine has long highlighted Western and foreign components used in Russian weapons to call for tougher sanctions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People run past a sound grenade fired by police to disperse demonstrators in Dhaka on Monday.ABDUL GONI/Reuters Bangladesh's ousted prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, was sentenced to death in her absence on Monday at the end of a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year. The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus described it as an “historic verdict,” but called for calm and warned that it would deal with any disorder. India said it noted the verdict and would “engage constructively,” without going into more detail. Hasina's son warned on Sunday there could be violence if a ban on her Awami League party taking part was not lifted. A United Nations report estimated that up to 1,400 people were killed and thousands wounded – most by gunfire from security forces – during the anti-government demonstrations between July 15 and August 5 last year, the worst political violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence. Judge Golam Mortuza Mozumder said Hasina, 78, was found guilty on three counts including incitement, ordering killings and failing to prevent atrocities during the uprising. In an e-mailed statement sent to media after the verdict, Hasina accused the court of being “biased and politically motivated.” The interim government urged Bangladeshis to remain calm. “Any attempt to create disorder, chaos, or disturb public order will be dealt with strictly,” it added. People wave Bangladesh's national flag as they celebrate the court's verdict.MUNIR UZ ZAMAN/AFP/Getty Images “The path ahead requires not just legal accountability but rebuilding trust between institutions and citizens,” interim leader Yunus said in a statement after the verdict. Hasina was represented by a state-appointed defence counsel who told the court that the charges against her were baseless and called for her acquittal. Military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad was sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in 1991 for illegally possessing firearms. Bangladesh is one of the world's largest garment exporters, supplying major global brands. The industry was hit hard by last year's protests.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a statement, the designation will take effect on November 24. Trump has long accused Maduro of cartel links, calling him a “narcoterrorist.” Despite Maduro's denials of the allegations, Washington dispatched a naval armada to the western Caribbean earlier this year, and since September, US forces have hit alleged drug-smuggling vessels near Venezuela. US officials also say Trump is considering strikes on cartel targets inside the country. It added that “neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,” accusing them of corrupting the country's institutions, directing “terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere,” and trafficking drugs into the US and Europe. “It allows us to do that,” Trump told reporters on Sunday. “They would like to talk… we'll see how that turns out.” It is unclear why he said the designation would allow strikes, as it would not permit attacks without separate authorization. Maduro has dismissed the allegations and the military buildup as an attempt to overthrow him, while urging Trump to negotiate. In September, he sent a letter to the White House in which he said Venezuela has dismantled the drug networks, offering direct talks. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

MOSCOW, November 17. /TASS/. Russia is consulting with Middle Eastern countries on the joint development and production of aircraft, including fifth-generation aircraft, Russian Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation Director Dmitry Shugayev told TASS.

"Negotiations with representatives of Middle Eastern countries on the joint development and production of aviation equipment, including fifth-generation aircraft and modern aviation weapons, are indeed continuing. These consultations are constructive and aimed at developing mutually acceptable technical and organizational solutions. At the current stage, we are discussing the parameters of potential cooperation and the distribution of responsibilities," he said on the sidelines of the Dubai Airshow 2025 international aviation and space exhibition.

Shugayev noted that the potential projects are long-term and technologically complex, requiring detailed study.</p>

Masaaki Kanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, headed to Beijing on Monday for talks with his Chinese counterpart over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's recent remark about Taiwan. Kanai is scheduled to meet with Liu Jinsong, director general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Department, on Tuesday. Amid a deepening rift in Japan-China relations, Tokyo hopes to calm the situation through diplomatic consultations with Beijing. In response to China's demand that Takaichi retract her remarks, Kanai is expected to seek Beijing's understanding by explaining that her comments do not contradict the Japanese government's established stance on the matter. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has also issued an advisory urging Chinese citizens to refrain from traveling to Japan for the time being. Kanai will also ask Beijing to take appropriate measures regarding the move. In connection with Takaichi's remark, Chinese Consul General in Osaka Xue Jian said in a post on X, “There would be no choice but to cut off that filthy head without a moment's hesitation.” Kanai is expected to lodge a protest over the post. Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said Monday that the Japanese government has answered by calling for an appropriate response from China. “We will continue to closely monitor the situation as it develops, including the impact of China's actions, and take appropriate measures,” he added.
