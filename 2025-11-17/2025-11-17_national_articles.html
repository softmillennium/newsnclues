                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• At least 130 people were arrested in North Carolina's largest city over the weekend in the Department of Homeland Security's latest targeted immigration blitz, spearheaded by Customs and Border Protection and dubbed Operation Charlotte's Web. Justices will review a controversial immigration policy adopted during the first Trump administration of turning away potential asylum seekers before they step foot on American soil. • The community of Charlotte is on edge: Students at a local high school plan a walkout Monday to protest the action, and a popular Colombian bakery remains closed after the owner says agents tackled people outside his shop. • Unlike other federal enforcement operations in Democratic-led cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, President Donald Trump made almost no prior mention of Charlotte, and local Democrats believe the action aims to “score political points.” • While police say violent crime has dropped by 20% this year in Charlotte, the city got nationwide attention this summer after Iryna Zarutska, 23, was stabbed to death without provocation on public transit. Profiling North Carolinians “based on what they look like, including American citizens and those with no criminal records” puts communities at risk because it leaves violent criminals at large, former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, wrote in a statement on X Monday. “I've prosecuted violent criminals and fought to keep them behind bars, so I know the importance of using federal resources to deport violent criminals and keep our borders strong,” he wrote, alleging what's happening with immigration sweeps are being done at random and based on physical appearance. Remember: Cooper announced his Senate run late July, boosting the Democratic party's hopes of winning the seat, which was opened by retiring Republican Sen. Thom Tillis. Heightened anxiety is gripping a Charlotte suburb after Huntersville mayor Christy Clark said her office has received verified reports of Border Patrol activity in town, with officers allegedly targeting primarily Latino communities. When asked about Border Patrol activity in Huntersville and the potential deployment to other suburbs outside of the city, a DHS spokesperson said they “do not discuss future or potential operations” and said the agency will not stop enforcing the nation's laws “until every criminal illegal alien is arrested and removed from our country.” Clark, who also works at a local public elementary school, said she is aware of families keeping their children home out of fear that the adults in their households could be detained. She described the immigrant community as part of what makes the town a “beautiful” and “wonderful place to live and work,” adding that she is saddened and angered that some residents now fear being “taken from their families without due process.” North Carolina-based Muslim political groups issued a joint statement today publicly condemning the presence of federal agents engaging in an immigration crackdown in the state. Customs and Border Protection, along with the Department of Homeland Security, launched “Operation Charlotte's Web,” the newest immigration blitz, in Charlotte on Saturday. “We also urge you to carry your legal identification with you at all times and comply if asked to,” the statement says. Community organizers opposing the new immigration enforcement blitz in Charlotte, North Carolina, saw a similar operation in Chicago as warning of what their community could experience. “It gives me great pleasure to know that our example has been useful to them,” wrote Ismael Cordová-Clough, an organizer in Evanston, Illinois – a community just north of Chicago that was the site of raids under Operation Midway Blitz. In Evanston, volunteer groups have been monitoring the area for immigration agents and handing out flyers asking people to report ICE activity, follow agents and record their activities. Operation Charlotte's Web is led by Border Patrol section chief Gregory Bovino, who also was in charge of the Chicago operation until late last week. Frustrated and saddened that some of his most loyal customers are now the targets of the immigration operation in Charlotte, David Rebolloso is keeping his laundromat open  — but locking the doors behind everyone that comes and goes. On Sunday, federal agents were in the parking lot of his business, North Tryon Laundromat, which is nestled in a strip mall that is primarily Latino owned, he said. Rebolloso was not there at the time, but witnesses told him agents chased some people out through the back door of his business, he said. Rebolloso isn't worried for his own safety as an American citizen but wouldn't be surprised if he was profiled based on the color of his skin, he said. “But we're open because people need to do laundry. Some of the people detained in Charlotte by US Border Patrol agents are being transferred to detention facilities in Georgia, a North Carolina-based immigration attorney said today. North Carolina doesn't have long-term detention facilities, so detainees are being moved to Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, and Folkston ICE Processing Center in Folkston, Georgia, immigration attorney Jeremy McKinney told CNN, citing accounts from people on the ground in Charlotte and attorneys working to locate detainees. CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for more information. At least 130 people have been arrested amid the latest immigration crackdown in Charlotte, according to a DHS spokesperson. Federal law requires the government to process asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry. But in 2018, President Donald Trump's first administration began a policy known as “metering,” in which border agents simply turned back potential asylum seekers to Mexico before they entered the US. An immigrant rights group, Al Otro Lado, and several asylum seekers filed a lawsuit in California challenging the policy. The Biden administration rescinded “metering” and instead began requiring most people seeking asylum to make an appointment before arriving at a port of entry. At least 130 people have been arrested in North Carolina's largest city so far in “Operation Charlotte's Web,” the newest Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection led immigration blitz, according to a DHS spokesperson. “During the first two days of Operation Charlotte's Web, Border Patrol arrested over 130 illegal aliens who have all broken the immigration laws of our country,” a DHS spokesperson told CNN in an email. When asked how many of those arrested were undocumented immigrants and how many had previous criminal records, the DHS spokesperson responded, “Criminal records of those arrested include known gang membership, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony larceny, simple assault, hit and run, possession of stolen goods, shoplifting, DUI, DWI, and illegal re-entry after prior deportation, a felony.” CNN has also reached out to CBP, ICE and HSI for those numbers. Before it even started, the announcement that an immigration enforcement operation would arrive in Charlotte — right on the heels of a weekslong operation that led to hundreds of arrests and fierce protests in Chicago — provoked fear and anxiety in the city. Manuel “Manolo” Betancur closed his family bakery Saturday after men in green uniforms chased and tackled people outside the shop, he told CNN. The officers emerged from unmarked SUVs on Saturday morning, “jumping and taking people down in the street, just people that look like me,” Betancur said. Betancur said he doesn't want his customers to risk a similar encounter with federal agents — not when they're just trying to buy cakes or pastries. Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino's crackdown on immigration is expected to continue apace in other Democratic-led cities after Charlotte. The president has talked about sending the National Guard to New Orleans, a Democratic-led city in a Republican-led state, as far back as September. The New Orleans mayor's office has not responded to CNN's outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there. Speaking to Fox News on Thursday from West Virginia — before the Charlotte operation was officially announced — Bovino floated a few cities that the Border Patrol could target next. Video shared to X by DHS shows some of what happened. “As agents were boxing him in — the driver proceeded to ram law enforcement vehicles in an attempt to escape,” the agency said. One law enforcement officer was injured during the incident. In the video, a white van can be seen driving off the street and onto a grassy area as it appears to go around law enforcement vehicles. At least two black SUVs are seen in pursuit of the van. Car crashes or ramming incidents have happened  over the past few months as many cities across the US have seen a crackdown on illegal immigration. “We value our strong relationships with all members of our community and remain dedicated to building trust while upholding the law,” the mayor continued. “We believe every person, regardless of immigration status, should feel safe in the community they call home.” Police in Asheville do not have authority to enforce immigration law, the mayor said. Students at one Charlotte high school are planning a walkout to protest the Department of Homeland Security's targeted immigration blitz in North Carolina's largest city. “The student's main objective is to provide protection and cover to their fellow students of immigrant descent,” a news release on the planned protest said. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools system issued a statement Sunday night saying there has been no immigration enforcement activity on school property and it has not received any notice of planned ICE actions at its schools. “CMS follows all federal and state laws protecting students' right to a public education. The U.S. Supreme Court guarantees that all children, regardless of immigration status, have the right to attend public school,” CMS Assistant Communications Officer Tom Miner said in a statement to school district families. Students should attend class, Miner said, but added that per district policy,  students who miss assignments due to absence are allowed to make up the work regardless of why they missed school. A top leader in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina — where Charlotte is located — says local officials still haven't received any information from Customs and Border Protection on how it is conducting its new immigration enforcement operation. “There's no coordination, collaboration or communication, and so it's stoking a lot of fear in our community,” Mark Jerrell, chairman of the Mecklenburg County Commission, told CNN's Audie Cornish this morning. What is this that allows folks just to be detained on the street, essentially profiled?” “There is a high level of profiling that appears to take place,” Jerrell added. Charlotte hadn't been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago and Los Angeles. And crime has dropped 8% from last year, with violent crimes down 20%, according to data released by the city in October. Democratic leaders in Charlotte have largely framed the operation — which came as a surprise to local officials — as a political distraction ahead of next year's midterm elections. “This administration ran on rhetoric that is anti-immigrant to score political points,” said City Council member Dimple Ajmera, a Democrat. “We have a very important US Senate race in 2026 coming up.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Earl Warren Building, headquarters of the Supreme Court of California and part of the Ronald M. George State Office Complex, is shown in San Francisco, Jan. 7, 2020. The Supreme Court in Washington, Nov. 4, 2020. WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court agreed Monday to review a policy used under past administrations to deny migrants a chance to apply for asylum on the Mexican border until space opened up to process claims. The justices will hear the Trump administration's appeal of lower court rulings that struck down the practice known as metering, in which U.S. border agents capped the number of people seeking asylum at border crossings by prohibiting migrants from setting foot in the U.S. The administration pressed for the high court's intervention even after President Donald Trump suspended the asylum system on the first day of his second term and advocates for migrants said the lower-court rulings have no ongoing practical effect. Metering was first used during President Barack Obama's administration when large numbers of Haitians appeared at the main crossing to San Diego from Tijuana, Mexico. It was expanded to all border crossings from Mexico during Trump's first term in the White House. President Joe Biden formally rescinded the use of metering in 2021. Still, the Justice Department said it wanted the justices to hear the case because the court rulings took away “a tool that administrations of both parties have deemed critical for controlling the processing of inadmissible aliens during border surges.” U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant ruled in 2021 that metering violated the migrants' constitutional rights and a federal law requiring officials to screen anyone who shows up seeking asylum. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Bashant's ruling in a 2-1 decision. People seeking refuge in the U.S. are able to apply for asylum once they are on American soil, regardless of whether they came legally. To qualify, they have to show a fear of persecution in their own country because of specific reasons, such as their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Once people are granted asylum, they can't be deported. They can work legally, bring immediate family, apply for legal residency and eventually seek U.S. citizenship. It offers a permanent future in the U.S.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Harvard University should sever ties with Larry Summers, the school's former president and one of its most prominent faculty members — putting new pressure on the elite university to hold Summers accountable for his close friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. New details of Summers' relationship with Epstein emerged last week when a House committee released emails showing years of personal correspondence between the two men, including Summers making sexist comments and seeking Epstein's romantic advice. Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor and now the Democratic senior senator from Massachusetts, said in response to a CNN inquiry that she believes Summers “cannot be trusted” with students given his past relationship with Epstein. “If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein's sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation's politicians, policymakers, and institutions — or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.” CNN has reached out to Summers and Harvard for comment. Summers has previously said he regrets his past association with Epstein. Summers served as Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary and Barack Obama's director of the National Economic Council and has been one of the country's most influential economic voices for decades. Warren, an economic populist, has clashed with Summers over financial regulations in the past. But her new call on policymakers and institutions to shun Summers represents an even sharper critique of his character. We are reviewing last week's disclosures to determine appropriate next steps.” Summers resigned as Harvard's president in 2006 under pressure amid multiple controversies, including his suggestion that men may perform better in the sciences because of genetic differences from women. He currently serves as the Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard. At other times, the two men appeared to discuss Summers' romantic endeavors, with Epstein offering advice. “Think no response for a while probably appropriate,” Summers wrote. Epstein wrote back in part: “she's already beginning to sound needy :) nice.” In March 2019, the two men exchanged multiple emails over the course of one morning, appearing to debate whether Summers should send a note to a woman of romantic interest. Summers' continued contact with Epstein during this period was particularly noteworthy because the Miami Herald published just months prior an exhaustive investigative series detailing Epstein's abuse of underage girls, and exposed what the paper called “the deal of a lifetime” that he negotiated in 2007 and 2008 to avoid federal charges. Sending a note would be “BAD FORM,” Epstein argued to Summers. And in one October 2017 email to Epstein, Summers mused: “I observed that half the IQ In world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.” Summers' wife, Elisa New, is a professor emerita of American literature at Harvard. Rachel McCleary, a lecturer in the economics department, where Summers still teaches, told The Crimson his relationship with Epstein was not “just one lapse” but rather a “character flaw.” Among those Trump singled out included Summers, Clinton and JPMorgan Chase.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. A criminal illegal immigrant who was released into the U.S. under the Biden administration and began working as a commercial truck driver has been arrested over alleged ties to terrorism, federal authorities announced Monday. Akhror Bozorov, 31, hails from Uzbekistan, where authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in 2022 for allegedly belonging to a terrorist organization, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said. Authorities in Uzbekistan accused him of distributing terrorist propaganda calling for jihad online and recruiting terrorists to join the jihad movement. ICE arrested Bozorov on Nov. 9 while he was working as a commercial truck driver, driving an 18-wheeler in Kansas. ICE said that Bozorov was issued a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) in Pennsylvania while Gov. Officials added that he was granted authorization to work in January 2024 under the Biden administration. Akhror Bozorov was arrested for his alleged ties to terrorism, federal officials said. "Not only was Akhror Bozorov — a wanted terrorist — RELEASED into the country by the Biden administration, but he was also given a commercial driver's license by Governor Shapiro's Pennsylvania," Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. Biden and Mayorkas allowed countless terrorists to come into our country." She added: "President Trump and Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target these national security threats." ICE said Bozorov was issued a CDL from Pennsylvania. Bozorov's license indicated he was living in the Somerton section of far northeast Philadelphia, a suburban-feeling neighborhood at the edge of the city limits, which has recently seen an influx of Russian and Arabic residents. In Pennsylvania, noncitizens with temporary or permanent resident status can currently qualify for PennDOT licenses. Fox News Digital reached out to Shapiro and PennDOT for further comment. Bozorov illegally entered the U.S. in February 2023, according to ICE. Border Patrol arrested Bozorov upon entry, though ICE said the Biden administration then released him into American communities. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said illegal aliens should not be operating trucks on American highways. Bozorov's recent arrest comes as the Trump administration is putting increased scrutiny on states that issue CDLs to immigrants after an illegal immigrant truck driver was accused of causing a tractor-trailer crash that killed three people in Fort Pierce, Florida. Following the deadly crash, the Department of Transportation attempted to put restrictions on immigrants obtaining commercial driver's licenses, but a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday ruled that the move cannot be enforced.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>THEY KNEW EPSTEIN WAS GUILTY OF TRAFFICKING UNDERAGE GIRLS. In 2014, the journalist-turned-adviser Michael Wolff wrote an unpublished profile of Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein gave Wolff, who had once hoped to go into business with the financier, access to his “absurdly vast house” in Manhattan and his life in it. We have the profile Wolff wrote because he emailed it to Epstein — not the sort of thing most journalists would do — and it was made public in the 20,000-plus documents House Republicans released last week. The theme of the profile is that many prominent and accomplished people decided to maintain their friendships with Epstein even after an investigation showed he lured a number of underage girls to his house for sex. In an infamous sweetheart deal, Epstein received an 18-month sentence that allowed him to come and go freely while spending nights in “jail.” While surprisingly few others dropped him, the Clintons did, an irony of the present tabloid interest in Epstein's old address book with its many Clinton contacts. And his sex offender status has transformed him from libertine playboy to pedophile in tabloid parlance.” The article is a long list of people who hung around with post-prison Epstein. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, “for whom Epstein has become a key adviser,” was helping Epstein deal with his image problems. Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury Secretary and president of Harvard University. Ehud Barak, the former prime minister of Israel. Thorbjørn Jagland, then-head of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee. And then: “A high ranking official from the Obama White House, whose name I am asked not to use.” They all came to Epstein's house in New York. “These meetings, and this lifestyle, have somehow stayed private or secret — or apart — not out of any formal or stated restrictions, but because, in some sense, it would be very hard to explain just what you're doing there with a brazen sex offender in a guffaw-inducing home flaunting all moderation,” Wolff wrote. Feeling that his invitation is quite an extraordinary privilege.” '” Wolff concluded that the atmosphere “may be part of the appeal for the men who come to visit Epstein.” After trying to explain the situation, Wolff ended up saying, “The constant attendance of so many comely young women seems so outside of conventional living or staffing or social or romantic relationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward or straight-faced way.” Given today's political situation and the things Wolff has been saying recently, here is something interesting. Out of all the names dropped, one is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump. The billionaire developer, reality TV star, and future president, who had a falling out with Epstein around 2004, did not even merit mention as a former friend. Wolff saw fit to name former President Bill Clinton as absent, but Trump, who at that point had not yet entered national politics, was just not there. Some years later, of course, after Trump became president, his adversaries saw Epstein, like they once saw Russia, as an opportunity to bring him down, and the Epstein story became all about Trump. But in 2014, when Epstein was alive and active and Wolff wrote the profile, Trump wasn't part of the picture. Whenever new information is released, such as the thousands of documents recently made public by the House GOP, and when that new information contains nothing to incriminate Trump, the usual suspects loudly proclaim that more new information is still being hidden that will incriminate Trump. One prominent Democratic senator, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, literally said recently, “Clearly, Donald Trump was at the center of a child sex ring. That is a positively surrealistic read on what we know about Epstein so far — and we know a lot. But do not expect Murphy or any of his allies to stop.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kay Ivey on Monday urged the board that oversees Alabama Public Television to delay any decision on severing ties with PBS until it has studied Alabamians' opinions on the matter and developed a plan for what comes next. The Republican governor sent a letter to the Alabama Educational Television Commission ahead of a Nov. 18 meeting in which commissioners were expected to discuss disaffiliation. Some commission members had pushed the idea of dropping PBS due to federal budget cuts, President Donald Trump's dislike of public broadcasting and accusations of bias against NPR and PBS news programs from him and other conservatives. “While I'm sympathetic to the concerns that may be prompting this proposal, such a sweeping, immediate action, especially if taken unilaterally by the executive branch, should be undertaken only after a thorough planning process and only with a thorough understanding of public opinion,” Ivey wrote. Ivey asked the commission to conduct an extended survey of Alabama voters “to ensure their voices are heard.” She said the commission should also develop a separation plan that “should be available for public review for a considerable length of time before any vote is taken.” Alabama Public Television Executive Director Wayne Reid said some commissioners asked him to research the possibility and ramifications of ending the contract with PBS. Commissioners were divided at an Oct. 28 meeting, according to the Alabama Reflector and al.com. Alabama Public Television pays about $2.2 million yearly for PBS programming. The governor said it is imperative that APT programming “align with Alabama values,” but said the decision should be made in “collaboration among stakeholders.” The possibility of dropping PBS prompted a backlash from Alabama public television viewers and donors. Petitions and posts were shared across social media, urging people to “Save PBS for Alabama Children” and “Don't let Alabama send Elmo packing.”</p>

FBI Director Kash Patel joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss President Trump's deal with China's Xi Jinping to curb the flow of chemicals used in fentanyl production, the latest on the Arctic Frost probe and more. Instead of waging a bloody battle that could ignite a clash between nuclear-armed states, China may be betting it can conquer Taiwan without firing a shot — by choking off the island's fuel and electricity until its government capitulates. China's campaign wouldn't start with missiles but with paperwork and patrol boats — "routine" inspections, new customs rules and cyber intrusions designed to quietly strangle Taiwan's imports while giving Beijing plausible deniability, according to a new report by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). The report warns that a successful Chinese squeeze on Taiwan's fuel would ripple far beyond Asia. With the island producing most of the world's advanced semiconductors, any prolonged power outage could halt global electronics and defense manufacturing — hitting U.S. supply chains and markets almost immediately. Its gray-zone campaign is a strategy of slow-motion strangulation — one that risks a sudden shock as Chinese ships and aircraft surge around the island," report author Craig Singleton said. An aerial view of a Chinese coast guard ship navigating near the disputed Scarborough Shoal, as Philippine coast guard aircraft carrying journalists patrols the area, days after two Chinese vessels collided in the area while allegedly trying to block a Philippine supply mission in the South China Sea. The findings stem from a tabletop exercise conducted this summer by FDD and Taiwan's Centre for Innovative Democracy and Sustainability at National Chengchi University. Teams representing China, Taiwan, the United States, Japan and other allies wargamed a monthslong campaign in which Beijing throttled Taiwan's fuel imports through "gray-zone" tactics — administrative slowdowns, cyberattacks and disinformation — all while maintaining plausible deniability. The exercise found that a prolonged squeeze on Taiwan's liquefied natural gas (LNG) could cripple its electrical grid within weeks and trigger a global chip shock. The report warns that cyber operations and propaganda would be central to Beijing's playbook. At the same time, Beijing would unleash a barrage of false narratives — rumors of blackouts, fuel hoarding and government incompetence — to erode public trust and fracture morale. "For Beijing, disinformation is not a sideshow but its primary weapon," the report notes, describing a campaign designed to "control the narrative and sap its adversaries' will." Taiwanese soldiers are deployed during a war and disaster drill as part of the annual Wan-An Air Raid Drill, at a seaport in New Taipei, Taiwan, on July 23, 2024. Taiwan imports nearly all of its energy — half from natural gas and about 30% from coal — and holds only "a few weeks' worth" of reserves. That dependency makes Taiwan one of the world's most energy-insecure economies. A blockade or "energy quarantine" could cut the island's power generation in half within weeks — forcing leaders to decide whether to keep the lights on for hospitals or for chipmakers like TSMC and UMC, Singleton and co-author Mark Montgomery write. "Coercion, not combat, is Beijing's preferred weapon," Singleton said, adding that such a blockade would have "ripple effects that would reshape global markets and stability alike." The report also calls for the United States to expand its own LNG export capacity — particularly through new projects in Alaska — to ensure it can supply Taiwan directly and make U.S. energy a core element of the island's resilience. Taiwan produces around 60% of global semiconductor chips and 90% of the world's most advanced chips, though TSMC is building a facility in Arizona to help offset that imbalance. "The choice to slowly shutter industrial capacity would eventually make Taiwan's conundrum a global catastrophe when a plurality of the world's supply of legacy chips and a supermajority of its advanced chips cease flowing," the report says. A Chinese blockade of Taiwan could shatter global semiconductor shipping. The authors argue that Taiwan should build up its LNG reserves through greater U.S. supply and for the U.S. Navy to be ready to escort vessels delivering it. "Beijing believes pressure plus patience equals political collapse," Montgomery said. "What unnerves China isn't Taiwan's defiance, but its people's ability to withstand coercion." But as China builds the tools to choke Taiwan's energy supply and shape its narrative abroad, the line between peace and pressure is narrowing.

Fox News' Bryan Llenas provides details on the unrest in Haiti and efforts to rescue Americans as gang uprisings in Port-au-Prince force residents to flee to the Dominican Republic. U.N. security directed staff to work remotely and restrict travel in the West region, while Haiti's National Police canceled all personnel leave until further notice, according to The Miami Herald. Integrated Office in Haiti, confirmed to Fox News Digital in an email that staff were asked to work from home for the day. Public threats from a powerful Haitian gang leader began circulating on social media in recent days following weekend security operations from the Haitian National Police, the Armed Forces of Haiti and the Gang Suppression Force (GSF), a multinational mission, authorized by the U.N. Security Council. Gang Leader Jimmy "Barbecue" Cherizier patrolling the streets with G-9 federation gang members in the Delmas 3 area on Feb. 22, 2024, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Jimmy Chérizier, widely known as "Barbecue," appeared in a video shared Sunday by an independent Haitian media outlet, urging people to stay home on Nov. 17 so they wouldn't "be a victim," according to a brief translation of his remarks. Leave the streets to 'Viv Ansanm' and the police so that we can confront them," "Barbecue" is quoted as saying, according to HaitiLibre, an independent Haitian news site based in Port-au-Prince. Viv Ansanm is a Haitian gang coalition that was designated by the U.S. State Department as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist and Foreign Terrorist Organization in May. It was formed in September 2023 through an alliance between the two main gang factions operating in Port-au-Prince, G-9 and G-Pép. The Friday operation resulted in the seizure of multiple weapons, including an M50-caliber Barrett rifle, six assault rifles and three pistols, they said. "This operation sends a clear and unequivocal message: the era of unchecked gang dominance is over. Haiti's security institutions are mobilizing all available capabilities; on land, at sea, and in the air, to restore peace, protect communities, and ensure that every Haitian can exercise their basic human rights without fear of violence," read a statement from GSF. "Joint intelligence-driven operations and continuous security patrols will persist until these criminal groups are decisively defeated." Police forces take part in an operation against powerful gangs near the National Palace in Port-au-Prince on July 9, 2024. GSF said a Haitian National Police helicopter providing aerial support during the operation was forced to make an emergency landing due to a mechanical malfunction. The team on board was evacuated by ground units, who came under heavy gang fire while conducting the rescue. On Thursday, U.S. Marines protecting the American Embassy in Haiti exchanged gunfire with suspected gang members. No service members were injured in the incident.

The MT Orinda was hit during the offloading of liquefied petroleum gas at Izmail port, Turkey's Directorate for Maritime Affairs said. All 16 crew on board evacuated and no one was hurt, it said. Ukrainian officials didn't comment specifically on the tanker, although regional military administration head Oleh Kiper said Russian drones attacked the Odesa region overnight and damaged energy and port infrastructure in several cities. The attack sparked multiple fires and damaged an unspecified number of civilian vessels, Kiper said, adding that one person was injured. Izmail lies on a Black Sea estuary and is one of a string of ports that are vital for Ukrainian imports and exports. With Russia also targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Zelenskyy is trying to ensure gas and other energy imports that can help see his country through the approaching winter. The U.S. liquefied natural gas will flow to Odesa via pipelines from the northern Greek port of Alexandroupolis starting in January. Four girls aged 12, 14, 15 and 17 were among those injured, authorities said. Russian drones and artillery also killed two people and injured two others in a daylight attack on Nikopol in the central Dnipropetrovsk region on Monday. Russia fired two Iskander-M ballistic missiles and 128 strike and decoy drones across the country during the night, Ukraine's air force said. Russian air defenses shot down 36 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia's Defense Ministry said, as Ukraine tries to hit back at Russia's power grid.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will review a controversial immigration policy adopted during the first Trump administration of turning away potential asylum seekers before they step foot on American soil, setting up the first major immigration policy case of the term. Federal law requires the government to process asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry. But in 2018, President Donald Trump's first administration began a policy known as “metering,” in which border agents simply turned back potential asylum seekers to Mexico before they entered the US. An immigrant rights group, Al Otro Lado, and several asylum seekers filed a lawsuit in California challenging the policy. The Biden administration rescinded “metering” and instead began requiring most people seeking asylum to make an appointment before arriving at a port of entry. Because of that, Al Otro Lado argued that the case “has almost no present implications, and likely no future implications either.” But the Trump administration balked at that reasoning, telling the Supreme Court that “this administration and future administrations should retain the option of reviving that practice when border conditions justify doing so.” A divided 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal law requires border agencies to inspect asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry, even if they did not enter the country. “In ordinary English, a person ‘arrives in' a country only when he comes within its borders,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court. But the groups supporting Al Otro Lado said that reading would make a mockery of the asylum process, empowering officials to render “inspection and asylum processing requirements wholly inoperable at ports of entry – the designated places where noncitizens may lawfully come into the United States – by simply blocking asylum seekers from stepping on U.S. soil.” This story was updated with more details on the case.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Indiana Republican lawmaker underwent a swatting incident on Sunday after President Donald Trump called him a “RINO” for opposing the Republican Party's mid-decade redistricting agenda. The email was sent around 5 p.m. Sunday, according to local authorities. Investigation showed that this was a prank or false email.” “A false or prank call of this nature will never be acceptable,” the statement reads. “Not only do calls like this waste and reduce resources of deputies serving and protecting other parts of our county, they have a negative impact on the victim and their families as well. The false email came hours after Trump criticized Goode and Rodric Bray, president pro tempore of the Indiana Senate, for abandoning his redistricting effort to gain two more House GOP seats in Indiana ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Friday, Bray announced that the Indiana Senate would not reconvene in December to proceed with redrawing the state's congressional map. Trump said he was “very disappointed” in the result, taking aim at Goode and Bray. Vice President JD Vance visited the state's lawmakers in August and again in October to encourage them to take up redistricting. A new map would turn the entire delegation red. Mike Braun (R-IN), whom he called a “friend of mine,” did not do enough to get the votes needed for a redistricting measure. “Considering that Mike wouldn't be Governor without me (Not even close! Indiana Republicans previously visited the White House for a meeting with Trump. Afterward, Braun warned that there could be funding repercussions for not working with the Trump administration. Later in the message, Trump implored Goode and Bray to do their jobs and, if they did not, suggested they risk being booted out of office. In response to the swatting incident, Goode called for civility. “Vigo County sheriff's deputies responded to the incident under the impression of a domestic violence emergency,” he wrote on X. “While this entire incident is unfortunate and reflective of the volatile nature of our current political environment, I give thanks to God that my family and I are ok.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? There's an open question hanging over both parties when it comes to Latino voters right now: How should they talk about the second Trump administration's ongoing campaign of mass deportations? On the Democratic side, that's over how to frame Trump's operations: as overreach and excessive — of going beyond what he promised to his recent converts and targeting longtime, law-abiding residents and sweeping up citizens through racial profiling — or to focus on other issues, like the economy. For now, there isn't consensus over any of this or even whether immigration is even an important or decisive issue for these voters. But both sides will still be spending the next few months looking at public opinion, primary voting, protests or popular backlash, and the campaign trail to get a sense of what approach might work. That's why I decided to take a look at what the data and research we have at this moment suggests and try to lay out the nuances of how Republican-voting Latinos are feeling right now. Polls, focus groups, and individual interviews with these voters all seemed to point in the same direction: a rightward shift among primarily working-class Latino voters, driven by a combination of economic anxiety and discontent with aspects of social liberalism that clashed with their more traditionalist views. In many ways, their views were beginning to align more with those of white working-class voters, and they voted in 2024 accordingly. Yet, just as this new conventional wisdom was beginning to settle, election results this year in New Jersey and Virginia suggested that the narrative about Latino voters — especially working-class ones with more conservative social views — had gone further than the voters themselves. Simply put, these voters wanted lower prices and a stronger economy, and, as my colleague Andrew Prokop has noted, Trump has signally failed to deliver on this fundamental promise. The research and data we have available right now backs up this interpretation. A new analysis by the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Initiative, for example, finds that Latino Republican voters in California are increasingly ambivalent about Trump's presidency. Analyzing statewide polling from the summer, the Initiative found that Latino Republicans are more likely than white or Asian GOP voters to oppose deporting longtime residents, more likely to support due process protections for potential deportees, and more skeptical of actions by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The report's authors suggest some recent enforcement actions are to blame. “Recent media depictions of ICE calvaries and gunmen entering family spaces, like MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, or picking up parents at school sites,” they wrote, “has felt like a step too far for some Republican voters. That said, it still remains unclear just how much these changing views will translate to a change in voting patterns. Being unhappy with Trump's stewardship is one thing; being unhappy enough with Trump's stewardship to vote against the Republican Party, however, is something else. Other issues — such as the economy or social conservatism — could end up being more important to these voters, as was the case in 2024. Similarly, a national poll from October found that, while these voters were wary of mass deportation's effect on their communities, they nevertheless still supported mass deportations and stricter border policies. It all paints a pretty muddled picture of just how far Latino Republicans are willing to bend or change on their politics when confronted with Trump's agenda. “One in three Republican Latinos told us they believe that their community is safer because dangerous criminals have been deported,” Anais X. Lopez, a pollster and analyst at BSP Research, told me. But, she emphasized that this trend still obscures the predominant issue in these voters' minds: prices, affordability, and the economy. Last year, “they were saying, ‘You know what? If we're going to vote for him, regardless of whether they agree with this immigration policy or not, if I'm going to vote for him, it's because I'm struggling economically.' Well, things haven't gotten better in one sense, and they also haven't gotten better in any other sense for them.” But there's also no doubt in my mind that this is at best, a very, very distant second in motivating partisan voting behavior,” Mike Madrid, a California Republican analyst and former California GOP political director, told me about this tension in voters' minds. “If the economy were good, no one would give a shit about immigration. You would not be seeing big changes in voting behavior. These voters are asking for the economy to be resolved, and if the economy were being resolved, there might still be variations in how these voters approve of enforcement, but it wouldn't be changing their voting behavior.” To Madrid and Lopez, this is the unresolved question facing American politics as it heads into another high-stakes midterm election. Is fear and frustration over mass deportation going to combine with economic dissatisfaction to create a larger and stronger swing against Republicans? Lopez argues that, at this point, it might be too late for Republicans to reverse those negative attitudes. Madrid, however, suggests there's still persuasion possible there, which suggests to Democrats that they should still prioritize economic messaging. “Yes, there is concern, there is fear, but overwhelmingly, we're in an economic crisis that affects 100 percent of Latinos,” Madrid told me. That's true of almost every issue, but especially now, the overwhelming number of Latino voters are US born and growing further into the generational cycle that matters in the outcome of these results, and it doesn't mean we're not sensitive to it, but it also means we're not lying awake at night, worried about ICE raids. How a neo-Nazi infiltrated so deep into the Republican Party. After Indiana opts out, is Republican redistricting backfiring? How Chinese hackers tricked Claude into hacking governments and companies all on its own. Thus far, the justices have signaled they may not let him — yet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a pair of cases in the coming months, which could significantly affect how much candidates coordinate spending with political parties and which mail ballots are counted ahead of next year's highly contested midterm elections. The justices have been preparing to hear arguments in the campaign finance law case National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission next month but opted to add Watson v. Republican National Committee, a case about a mail ballot counting law, to the docket for arguments later this term. On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to take up Watson v. RNC, which centers on the question of whether Mississippi's law allowing mail ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they are received up to five days later is preempted by a federal statute setting Election Day nationwide. “And until that has happened, a ballot is not considered cast, and therefore you cannot have ballots coming in after Election Day, because that means de facto votes are being cast after the election is concluded.” “Allowing states to count large numbers of mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day undermines trust and confidence in our elections,” Gruters said. Mail ballot deadlines vary by state, but most require ballots to be received on or before Election Day. Only a minority of states accept ballots postmarked by Election Day that arrive later. In Mississippi, mail ballots are accepted up to five business days after Election Day. In Illinois, ballots are accepted up to 14 days after Election Day, while in California, mail ballots can be received up to seven days after Election Day. Snead said that if the high court opts to strike down the Mississippi law and other post-Election Day mail ballot deadline laws, it would be a change for some states, but not for most states across the country. “I think it is fairly easy, if you are a state that has a policy to allow a ballot to be received and counted after Election Day, simply change the receipt deadline to line up with in-person voting rights.” “And it would be fairly easy to establish the same policy for mail-in voting.” “We will not run the risk of deciding this legal question in a postelection context, where the Supreme Court will not only be answering the question of what federal law does or does not do, but also likely who is going to win and who is going to lose, which party is going to control Congress, potentially,” Snead said. “Since their inception, these coordinated party expenditure limits have been a form of speech rationing in search of a rationale,” the NRSC's brief to the Supreme Court reads. “Given that they were enacted to reduce what incumbents saw as wasteful and excessive campaign spending by political parties, the government has spent decades casting about for a way to recharacterize them as an anti-corruption measure.” “You've got to come up with some plausible theory of bribery, and if you don't have that, then regulation is really not constitutional.” Greenberg also noted that if the high court strikes down the coordinated expenditure limits, then political parties could regain some of their power in swaying campaigns. “We live in an era of American history where parties are incredibly weak, and I think that if these regulations were struck down, it would certainly help parties to become relatively stronger,” Greenberg said. Opinions in both cases are expected to be released by the end of June 2026, meaning any changes to election rules caused by the high court's decision would be in time for the midterm elections in November 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? For the past several weeks, the American conservative movement has been publicly embroiled in a bitter, existential conflict between factions seeking to win control of its future. Rather, it's a harbinger of the post-Trump future to come. The Fort Sumter moment of this particular civil war came in late October, when Tucker Carlson — arguably the MAGA right's most influential journalist — hosted Nick Fuentes, a gutter antisemite with a large online following, on his podcast for a friendly interview. Then the backlash began in earnest, with some Heritage scholars and even Republican senators speaking out publicly. Chris DeMuth, one of Heritage's most prominent recent hires, quit in protest. When you hear this rhetoric, you may think that this is a simple struggle between the honorable conservative old guard and the insurgent online right. And yet, there is an obvious problem with this framework: The remaining “old guard” on the right today is almost uniformly pro-Trump. What is happening now, then, is less about preserving the genteel Buckley-and-Reagan right (which itself was always more dependent on extremists than many conservatives are willing to admit). And the leaders of right-wing institutions no longer have the power to police their own and say, “We will go this far, but no farther.” Only, instead of police abolition and “white fragility,” the ideas in question are pushing women out of the workplace and executing “perfidious Jews.” Given the anti-Roberts furor among some of Heritage's staff, you might think that the organization is a bastion of principled conservatism reflecting on its recent choices. But one Heritage insider I spoke to painted a different, and more worrying, picture of its internal culture. This person is quite familiar with both Roberts and Heritage's upper echelons; were I to publish their name, there is a very real chance their career would be over. But nonetheless, they felt the need to speak out, so we're not disclosing their name in order to protect them from retaliation. But they were deeply alarmed at what had happened to the place, warning of extremist “counter-culture thinking [that] has seeped in” among a portion (though not all) of the staff. While the source believes leadership does not share these staffers' politics, they believe it has created a climate of permissiveness — allowing a “rot” to set in. Heritage, for its part, describes the claims as “defamatory” — asserting that “Heritage has zero tolerance for racism” and threatening Vox with legal action. “We're used to Leftist lunatics spewing lies about conservatives, so it's unsurprising that the so-called source is laundering this gossip through a far-Left outlet like Vox,” the organization said in its statement. He is currently listed on its website as “the Chief Economist, and Richard Aster Fellow, in The Heritage Foundation's Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget,” and last published an article on Heritage's website under that title on November 4 (well over a month after his withdrawal). In 2023, Heritage brought on John McEntee — a key Trump ally who worked on personnel issues — to help construct Project 2025's database of staffers for a future GOP administration. The next year, McEntee publicly “joked” about revoking women's right to vote in a post on X. Third, other Heritage insiders have made related complaints after Roberts's public defense of Carlson. Last Friday, professor Adam Mossoff — a visiting fellow at Heritage — released a letter of resignation addressed to Roberts in which Mossoff accuses him of tolerating rising extremism in the right's ranks. Your videos and statements have made it clear that we embrace as ‘friends' those who embrace and proselytize these evil ideas under the guise of a big tent on the right in which self-proclaimed conservatives can have friendly and cheery conversations with modern Nazis,” Mossoff wrote. “It is one thing for you to make this choice as an individual, but you have made this choice for the Heritage Foundation.” For all its notable issues, it is important not to treat Heritage in isolation. It is quite common for someone to hold some provocative beliefs, especially on issues of identity and bigotry, that they do not wish to share publicly. It is unusual — but not unheard of — for such a person to openly identify their own views as “racist” or “sexist.” What's more common is a sense that certain “truths” are unsayable in public, because anyone who offered them would risk professional or personal consequences from a mainstream in hock to leftist PC or “woke” sentiments. What exactly those “unsayable truths” are is a subject on which people across the right disagree among themselves. Take race, for example: There is a deep divide between those who blame persistent inequalities on alleged deficiencies in Black culture and those who assert that Black genetics mean they (as a group) are more likely to have low IQs. The point is not that all conservatives hold one of those two views on the causes of racial inequality, or any other similar issue. The American right is a broad and heterogeneous movement, many of whom would reject both of the above views in private and in public. Rather, the point is that these are normalized debates inside broader conservative spaces: the sorts of things that people employed at places like Heritage feel they can argue with each other about in safe spaces. As recently as 2013, theorizing about the inherently lower IQ of Latino immigrants would get you fired from Heritage; today, such views are openly aired in the public debate. In a recent essay, writer Helen Andrews — who has a history of pushing boundaries on race — dubiously argued that many of the ills of the modern American workplace can be blamed on women's mass participation in it. Near its conclusion, Andrews describes feeling trepidation about airing her true views: I was apprehensive about putting forward the Great Feminization thesis in such a public forum. I made sure to express my argument in the most neutral way possible. You can see, in Andrews's comment, exactly the private-conversation-going-public effect that I'm describing. Just recently, Andrews appeared on the New York Times's Interesting Times podcast to make her case — in an episode initially titled “Did Women Ruin the Workplace?” That's because the contours of the right's internal discussion of that issue are qualitatively different from what they are on race or gender. Among conservatives, it's widely recognized that the movement's youth are, in general, more radical than their elders. My Heritage insider source, for example, warned that “some of the younger staff members [are] playing around with some really dangerous ideas I thought were going to lead to disaster, and we're kind of living through that now.” Sometimes the young and old right are in directional agreement, even if they disagree vehemently on specifics. The difference here is more about degree than kind. Yet on Jews, the two generations face a genuine divergence in orientation. The older guard on the right is not only staunchly pro-Israel, but also more likely to see Jews as a kind of “model minority”: proof that a minority group can overcome discrimination through grit and hard work rather than government handouts. The youth cadres, by contrast, are instinctively skeptical of US commitments to foreign states and deeply suspicious of the (mostly liberal) Jewish community's influence on American politics. This generational divide, born out by the best survey data on antisemitic attitudes, was vividly on display at the leaked Heritage meeting. Their ranks included Evan Myers, a speechwriter for Roberts, who claimed that a proposal for the organization to host an apologetic Shabbat dinner would amount to an insidious form of discrimination against Christians like him. So I want to be clear: It's not that all, or even most, young Republican operatives are Fuentes-style antisemites. But many of them — far more than outsiders would likely believe — sure sound like it. The most alarming estimate, offered repeatedly by social conservative pundit Rod Dreher, is that 30 to 40 percent of Gen Z Republicans in DC have views like Fuentes's. They feel like large numbers of young conservatives do not share their values when it comes to Jews and Israel, and that the rise of people like Fuentes and Carlson represents an existential threat to the movement as they understand it — much more so than race-and-IQ theorizing or Andrews-style reactionary gender politics. “For Republicans, the donors and the…movement rank-and-file have been aligned on most issues. In the past, such a fraught conversation might be the sort of thing that could be cordoned off into private right-only spaces. There are many reasons why the right's internal conversation has gone public. Some of the biggest ones are technological: Social media has demolished gatekeepers of all kinds, and the rise of direct online payment models has made it so people like Carlson can make a handsome living in ways that the right's traditional elite have no ability to shut off. And on that front, I think one of the most revealing conversations I had came with a formerly canceled conservative columnist named Jack Hunter. In the late '90s and early 2000s, Hunter was a kind of proto-Fuentes. The Southern Avenger endorsed Lincoln's assassination, claiming to raise a toast every year on John Wilkes Booth's birthday. He mooted modern-day Southern secessionism and called on someone to “whip” the Black director Spike Lee. He said that “a non-white-majority America would simply cease to be America for reasons that are as numerous as they are obvious.” As he got older, Hunter moved away from this racism — turning instead to a more principled kind of libertarianism and becoming an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY). But after Paul hired Hunter as his social media director in 2012, he became a visible target for their internal GOP enemies. In 2013, a reporter from the Washington Free Beacon — a neoconservative outlet opposed to Paul and Hunter's foreign policy views — dug up evidence of Hunter's neo-Confederate past. He resigned from Paul's office two weeks after the story broke. People I trust say Hunter is sincere in his conversion, and after speaking to him for nearly an hour this week, I agree. Part of this is personal: Carlson had been kind to Hunter in the past, and he's a loyal guy. Part of this is that he sees Carlson's actions differently, not as an attempt to mainstream Fuentes but, rather, to win his viewers. Hunter sees people like Roberts and Carlson as trying to move it in a saner direction — away from an unquestioning lockstep alliance and toward the kind of relationship that won't implicate the US in what Hunter describes as a “genocide” against Palestinians. I think it's healthy as hell,” he tells me. “If you were going to shake America, and particularly the American right, from this Israel obsession…it was always going to look like this stateside.” In this kind of war, he argues, the gloves need to come off. Anyone with eyes can see that Donald Trump is the figure currently holding a fractious right together. But Trump's ideological incoherence, together with his charismatic cult of personality, allows him to unify them under the banner of fighting the left. And while there is no plausible vehicle for a return to the pre-MAGA era, there are plenty of policy issues within the right — ranging from tariffs to Israel — where there is no consensus and the future remains uncertain. That means that party actors view each individual spat not just through the lens of principle, but also factional interest going forward. So it's not just that taboos over private debates on the right are breaking down. It's that these newly public debates over offensive topics are becoming a critical part of the right's post-Trump struggle for power. It's hard to say how any of this will shake out at present. But one person is shaping up to be a key figure: Vice President JD Vance. Previously defining himself as a “postliberal” opposed to the American “regime,” he has more recently been defending Republican operatives who got caught privately texting things like “I love Hitler.” And indeed, he is close with both Roberts and Carlson, the latter of whom reportedly played an instrumental role in Vance's selection as vice president. Yet at the same time, Fuentes regularly rails against Vance — with one of his principal gripes being that Vance's wife, Usha, is of Indian descent. Perhaps for this reason, many on the older right believe they can win Vance to their side. There is no option to stay neutral here for Vance. Amid these pleas, saying nothing would send a clear message that he won't rein in Carlson or Roberts's flirtation with Fuentes. Whatever decision he makes, it appears, will be a defining one: It will help decide not only which factions are currently ascendant in Washington, but also whether the right's top leadership will even attempt to shove some of its newly public discourse back into the conservative closet. ﻿Reasonable people can disagree about whether Hitler was good, says the Heritage Foundation. The right's new assault on free speech isn't cancel culture. ﻿Is the best way to fight Trump “normal” politics — or something else? A roundtable discussion among leading MAGA intellectuals suggests they might be suffering from success.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new owner of Dominion Voting Systems affirmed in his first interview since buying the company that President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election and pledged that his company's machines, used by nearly a third of US voters, won't be misused to help either political party. Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican election official from St. Louis who already runs a separate election tech company, bought Dominion last month and rebranded it Liberty Vote. The surprise move, and a public announcement that seemingly embraced parts of Trump's push to transform voting procedures, spooked election officials around the US, raising concerns about the future of a company that unexpectedly found itself at the center of Trump's attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss. After the 2020 election, Trump and his allies publicly claimed, repeatedly and falsely, that Dominion software flipped millions of his votes to Joe Biden. Dominion filed defamation lawsuits against many of the Trump lawyers and advisers who pushed these lies, and against the right-wing TV networks that gave them airtime. (Its case against Fox News famously settled for a historic $787 million in 2023.) Since buying Dominion last month, Leiendecker has embarked on a goodwill tour of sorts, meeting with about 80% of Dominion customers, spanning about half the country, and privately reassuring election administrators with a flurry of in-person visits and video conferences. I'm on democracy's side,” Leiendecker told CNN in an exclusive and wide-ranging interview. Despite his past work in Missouri GOP politics, Leiendecker said he isn't currently registered with any party, and “I am absolutely not an election denier.” After many states with Dominion machines held successful elections this month, some of their worst fears have eased, largely thanks to what Leiendecker has said in private meetings. One major source of comfort was Leiendecker's promise to keep existing Dominion employees on the job, multiple election officials said. This could be problematic among hardcore election deniers who have called for purges. One of the things he said to me was that the staff that was at Dominion were really great.” Michigan officials were similarly told last month by the vendor that services their Dominion equipment that they'll be using “the same proven product,” and to expect “no changes,” according to an email obtained by CNN. Trump has a long history of leaning on perceived allies in the election space to do his bidding. Some on the right have already criticized Leiendecker for not doing enough to help Trump as Dominion's new owner. Cleta Mitchell, who runs a national network of GOP election activists, said in an X post, “It is all a ruse. All of it,” complaining that the new owner hasn't returned the $67 million settlement it received from Newsmax or invited GOP activists to audit its machines. And there is also now growing distrust on the left. Last week, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat, claimed without evidence that Leiendecker bought Dominion to help Trump “cheat, potentially, with the voting machines” in the 2026 midterms, and urged states to stop using Dominion. It touted usage of “hand-marked paper ballots” (a Trump obsession). It encouraged “third-party auditing” (made infamous from the GOP-backed Arizona snafu). And it highlighted its “100% American” ownership (even though Dominion wasn't foreign-run). It also promised “compliance with President Trump's executive order” on elections. That order, which had already been partially blocked by a judge, featured Trump's wish list to drastically change US election rules, like ending most mail-in voting and requiring proof of citizenship before registering. A lot of that language set elections officials on edge. “The owner's comment about making sure people use paper ballots did give me pause,” said Barb Byrum, the Democratic election clerk for Lansing, Michigan, who says she still hasn't been contacted by Leiendecker or his new team. “That is a typical election conspiracy theorist talking point. Byrum, who is running for the Democratic nomination in Michigan's secretary of state race next year, said liberal activists are regularly asking her at campaign events to address their suspicions about the Dominion sale. “Folks on the left, who worry that MAGA now owns our elections, should not be worried,” Becker said. “And folks on the right, who think this fixes everything because Dominion was changing outcomes of elections, they're wrong too.” Dominion's founder and CEO, John Poulos, already personally knew Leiendecker from their work in the relatively small election equipment industry, the person said. As negotiations over a sale began and intensified earlier this year, “the circle around it was kept really small,” the person said. “I don't want to sound corny, but I felt like it was my calling, in a sense,” Leiendecker told CNN of his decision to buy Dominion. And I raised my hand to try to hopefully steer things in a direction where all voters can feel proud about what we do here in America.” To help with the rollout, Leiendecker worked with Logan Circle Group, a Trump-aligned public relations firm that vows to fight for “America First.” But election officials who have worked closely with Leiendecker are willing to vouch that he's not a partisan actor. “I've known this guy for 10 years, and I had no idea what his political party was,” said Manifold, the Atlanta-area elections supervisor. There have been record levels of disinformation, public vitriol and even death threats. The Dominion-related conspiracy theories were a big part of that. “I asked him point blank in our first meeting, where he's at on the election, and if he believes 2020 was stolen,” said Matt Crane, a Republican who runs the Colorado County Clerks Association. In Leiendecker's interview with CNN, he shied away from directly disavowing Trump's mantra that the election was “rigged.” But he made clear that he does not have concerns about the legitimacy of the 2020 election results. We saw a winner and we saw a loser in that election.” (Multiple Republican-run recounts confirmed Biden's victory in the state, which was certified by Georgia's Republican governor.) Leiendecker added: “I don't really like to go back and talk about what happened in 2020. Professionals from both political parties ran elections, reported results, conducted audits and worked with vendors, often without issue. He later founded KNOWiNK, a company that pioneered using iPads for electronic pollbooks, which are used to check in voters and verify their registration status when they arrive at their polling place. Their Poll Pad is now ubiquitous across the face of US elections. Borgmeyer said KNOWiNK helped him adapt during the Covid-19 pandemic. Borgmeyer said they used new KNOWiNK technology to print ballots “on demand” for individual voters to use after they checked in. Pollbooks aren't involved in casting or counting ballots. After buying Dominion, Leiendecker is now a major player in that part of the process. For the 2024 presidential election, more than 63 million registered voters lived in jurisdictions that used Dominion machines or software, according to Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that tracks the equipment in every jurisdiction. Still, industry insiders who spoke to CNN emphasized that even if Leiendecker wanted to weaponize his new company to boost Trump, as some Democratic lawmakers and activists fear, there would be serious structural limitations. “I don't think a MAGA takeover is even possible,” a former senior Dominion official, who left years before it was sold, told CNN. It's run by county clerks and secretaries of state. There are also financial reasons why this wouldn't be a smart move. And embracing Trump's call for hand-counting would undercut sales of their ballot tabulator machines. The former Dominion official said, “if they did all the election denier stuff, it would not be a viable business.” And when CNN asked Leiendecker whether his acquisition of Dominion was a MAGA takeover, he replied, “it's not.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A report by an Israeli human rights group says at least 98 Palestinians have died in Israeli detention facilities since the war in Gaza began. Physicians for Human Rights-Israel says systematic violence and denial of medical care contributed to the majority of the deaths it looked into. TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The number of Palestinians dying in Israeli custody surged to nearly 100 people since the start of the war in Gaza, according to a report published Monday by a human rights group that says systematic violence and denial of medical care at prisons and detention centers contributed to many of the deaths it examined. The picture that emerges from the report by Physicians for Human Rights-Israel is consistent with findings by The Associated Press, which interviewed more than a dozen people about prison abuses, medical neglect and deaths, analyzed available data, and reviewed reports of autopsies. The former guard at a military prison notorious for its harsh treatment of Palestinians told the AP detainees were routinely shackled with chains and kicked and hit with batons, and that the facility had been dubbed a “graveyard” because so many prisoners were dying there. PHRI says the actual death toll over this timeframe is “likely significantly higher,” noting that Israel has refused to provide information about hundreds of Palestinians detained during the war. The number of prisoners dying grew at an even faster rate over that period, PHRI data shows. PHRI documented deaths by interviewing former detainees and prison medical staff, examining reports prepared by doctors who observed autopsies at the behest of dead prisoners' families, and confirming dozens of fatalities through freedom of information requests. “The alarming rate at which people are killed in Israeli custody reveals a system that has lost all moral and professional restraint,” said Naji Abbas, a director at PHRI. Last year, the head of Israel's prison system, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, boasted that he had degraded prison conditions to the legal minimum. Israel's Prison Service said it operates in accordance with the law. The army said it is aware some detainees have died, including people with preexisting illnesses or combat-related injuries. It said allegations of abuse or inadequate conditions are assessed, and that those who violate the army's code of conduct are punished and sometimes subject to criminal investigations. This undated photo from winter 2023 provided by Breaking The Silence, a whistleblower group of former Israeli soldiers, shows blindfolded Palestinian prisoners captured in the Gaza Strip by Israeli forces at a detention facility on the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel. Although hesitant at first, the former guard at the Sde Teiman military prison in southern Israel said he eventually participated in beatings of prisoners. One morning, early in Israel's war against Hamas, the guard arrived at work to see a motionless Palestinian lying on his side in the yard, yet no guards rushed to see what had happened to the man, who was dead. Prisoners' arms and legs were always in chains, and they were beaten if they moved or spoke, the guard said, adding that nearly all would urinate and defecate on themselves rather than ask to use the bathroom. The former nurse at Sde Teiman said chains used to restrain many prisoners' arms and legs caused such severe wounds that some needed their limbs to be amputated. The army said prolonged handcuffing is implemented only in exceptional cases when there are “significant security considerations.” Even then, detainees' medical condition is taken into account, it said. Only a few detainees from Gaza are currently being handled this way, it added. Eventually cameras were installed, which helped mitigate the abuse, he said. Twenty-nine prisoners have died at Sde Teiman since the war began, according to PHRI. Earlier this year, an Israeli soldier was convicted of abusing Palestinians in Sde Teiman and sentenced to seven months in prison, according to the army, which said this shows there is accountability. But lawyers for prisoners say Israel rarely conducts serious investigations into alleged violence and that this fuels the problem. In a sign of the public climate, the Israeli military's top lawyer was recently forced to resign after acknowledging she approved the leak of a surveillance video at the center of an investigation into allegations of severe sexual abuse against a Palestinian at Sde Teiman. Several soldiers were indicted in that case, which is still pending before the military court. It is difficult to pinpoint with certainty the cause of death for most prisoners. Sometimes, at the behest of prisoners' families, doctors were granted permission by Israel to attend autopsies and provided reports to the families on what they saw. Eight reports seen by the AP showed a pattern of physical abuse and medical neglect. In one, a 45-year-old man who died in Kishon detention center, Mohammad Husein Ali, showed multiple signs of physical assault, likely causing brain bleed, according to the report. The potential use of excessive restraints was also noted. Husein Ali had previously served time in an Israeli prison after being convicted of association with militancy, according to his family. Relatives of Mohammad Husein Ali, a 45-year-old man who died in the Israeli Kishon detention center, sit in their living room in the Nur Shams refugee camp near the West Bank town of Tulkarem, Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025. From left are Mohammad's father Waleed Husein Ali, wife, Hadeel, son, Bara', daughter, Misk, an unidentified relative, and Mohammad's mother, Sobheya Husein Ali. Malnutrition was a contributing factor in at least one death, according to PHRI, leading to a 17-year-old boy dying from starvation. In September, Israel's Supreme Court ordered that more and better food be served to Palestinian inmates. It said every detainee is examined by a doctor upon arrival and, for those who need it, monitored with regular checkups. Sariy Khuorieh, an Israeli-Palestinian lawyer from Haifa, said he was detained at the start of the war after Israel accused him of inciting violence through his social media posts. While in Megiddo prison for 10 days, Khuorieh says he saw a man die after repeated beatings. The night before the man died, he screamed in pain for hours while in solitary confinement, said Khuorieh, who choked back tears while recounting what happened. The man had repeatedly called for a doctor, but none came, Khourieh said. A spokesperson for Israel's Prison Service wouldn't comment on the case. A report written about the man's autopsy seen by AP said the cause of death was inconclusive but that there were signs of old and new bruising, including broken ribs. The report said it could be assumed that violence contributed to his death. When the guards opened the man's cell they kicked and beat him before summoning a physician who tried to revive him and then pronounced him dead, said Khuorieh, who said he was able to see what was happening through the small window in his cell door. Once the man was pronounced dead, Khuorieh said one of the officer's laughed and said: there's “at least one less” to care about.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Once an engine of radical social upheaval, the Chinese Communist Party is coaxing its citizens toward conservative lifestyles in line with its traditional culture. Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only,” an Apple spokesperson announced. It was legalized in 1997, but Beijing has sought to curb public exposure of LGBT organizations, art, and activism. Jack Burnham, a research analyst in the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' China Program, said that this posture fits into the CCP's development of a “very culturally conservative worldview” that rejects influences deemed “not Chinese.” “But once [Chinese President] Xi Jinping came into power, he really did have a more conservative attitude around these types of things, and he started to see kind of a snowball effect around the silencing of LGBTQ voices within China.” Without no obvious parallels in the case of Blued and Finka, it seems that social value concerns are indeed driving the CCP's censorship on LGBT platforms. Similar campaigns have been widely documented in Russia, where the government has used its relationship with the Orthodox Church to promote socially conservative values and traditionalist sentiment among its population. Leaders see modern initiatives such as Pride parades, hook-up apps, and LGBT rights campaigns as a distinctly foreign development being imported into the country. “It's not so much that it's rooted in religious aspects, though there may be religious undertones,” Burnham told the Washington Examiner. “It's more rooted in a very strong focus on preserving this traditional — even in some ways, almost ancient — type of society that was ordered around having obedience to a strong father figure [and] having a mother that took care of children.” The Communist Revolution, rooted in the Western ideology of Marxism-Leninism imported from Europe, advocated a total rejection of native, Imperial-era customs and social structures. Xi's emphasis on childbearing is no doubt influenced by China's grim population projections, which led the CCP to abandon the disastrous one-child policy it introduced in 1979. China's foreign study programs, dubbed “Confucius Institutes,” aim to capitalize on the philosopher's name recognition abroad while transmitting pro-China narratives drafted by communist academics. Mao once deemed the ancient scholar and his teachings to be “feudal poison,” but Xi attends Confucius festivals as a guest of honor and advocates “using the past to serve the present.” “The CCP project is very much melding these kind of socialist ideological tenets with what they view as the best aspects of a Chinese society and Chinese culture that has adapted over thousands and thousands of years,” Burnham explained. If foreign influence and social decline are at the root of China's opposition to Blued and Finka, a mirrored campaign against such ills is being fought against Beijing in the United States. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the new American board of directors would maintain control over the app's algorithm, which has been accused of feeding users harmful, antisocial content.</p>
