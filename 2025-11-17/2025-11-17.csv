            Gunmen attacked a government girls' boarding school in Nigeria's Kebbi State early on Monday, killing the vice principal and abducting 25 female students, police said, in the latest mass kidnapping in the country's northwest.
    


            The assailants, armed with rifles and reportedly using coordinated tactics, stormed Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in Maga town around 4 a.m. local time, engaging police in a gunfight before scaling the perimeter fence and seizing the students, police spokesperson Nafiu Abubakar Kotarkoshi said.
    


Gunmen who kidnapped 287 school children in Nigeria say they will kill them all if $622,000 ransom not paid



            Vice Principal Hassan Yakubu Makuku was shot dead while resisting the attackers, and another staff member sustained gunshot injuries, he added.
    


            Police said additional tactical units, soldiers and local vigilantes have been deployed to comb suspected escape routes and surrounding forests in a search-and-rescue operation.
    


            Northwest Nigeria has witnessed repeated school abductions by armed gangs seeking ransom payments, despite government pledges to improve security in the region. Islamist militant group Boko Haram kidnapped 270 schoolgirls in 2014 in the northeastern town of Chibok. While many of the girls managed to escape or were later released, some have never been returned.

            Ukraine will purchase “up to 100” French-made Rafale fighter jets as well as anti-air defenses and drones from France, the Elysee Palace confirmed, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Paris on Monday.
    


            “We will have the greatest air defense system, one of the greatest in the world,” the Ukrainian president told reporters after signing the letter of intent with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Villacoublay Air Force Base southwest of Paris on Monday morning.
    


            At a news conference, Zelensky told reporters that the deal would include eight air defense systems and six launchers in what he described as an “historic agreement.”
    


            Macron said that some of the deliveries of drones, interceptor drones and guided bombs, would come in the “very short term” with manufacturing commitments made for the coming three years. The Elysee Palace said that the purchases covered by the letter of intent would span the next 10 years.
    


            Macron said that Ukraine will receive a “new generation” of the SAMP/T missile interceptor – largely comparable to the US-made Patriot system – which will be available in 2026.
    


            Questioned over the financing of the deal, Zelensky said Ukraine was examining the possible co-production of the French-made jets.
    


            This was Zelensky's ninth visit to Paris since the 2022 Russian invasion, as France has become a central pillar of Western support for Ukraine, particularly given the unpredictability of US weapons supplies.
    


            In a powerful show of Franco-Ukrainian military cooperation, the leaders inked the agreement in front of a Rafale jet loaded up with guided AASM bombs and beside a SCALP cruise missile that Paris has already supplied to Kyiv.
    


            The two leaders were flanked by a SAMP/T missile interceptor system and a GF300 radar system that France has also sent to Ukraine.
    


            The Rafale is a multi-role fourth generation fighter jet, similar in role to the American F-16, capable of carrying out long-range bombing and dogfighting tasks in the same mission, according to the French military.
    


            France has previously provided Kyiv with Mirage jets, which form the backbone of France's aerial bomber force.
    


            France has seen broad success exporting the Rafale, including to India.
    


            In what has been described as the largest aerial battle of the modern era, India lost one of its Rafale jets in combat with Pakistani forces in May, according to a French intelligence source. However, the French jets' performance in the India Air Force has been widely praised by expert reviews in the Indian press.
    


            The French aviation firm behind the Rafale, Dassault, is looking to boost its production output to four fighter jets per month and the company said it has 233 jets still on order, as of October 7.
    


            The agreement signed Monday is merely a letter of intent, still a way off a concrete purchase, spurring questions as to how Ukraine will pay for the French jets when Ukraine signed a letter of understanding  for 100-150 Swedish-made Grippen jets in October.
    


            In a letter to European Union members on Monday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggested that Ukraine had three options – independently or in combination – to meet its financing needs. She said these were grants from EU allies, a loan funded by EU borrowing or loan linked to the cash balance of frozen Russian assets, according to Reuters.
    


            The Elysee Palace also said that European financing could be used for the purchases as well as financing from frozen Russian assets.

The US plans to designate the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles, which it claims is led by President Nicolas Maduro, as a terrorist organization, the State Department has announced. According to a statement, the designation will take effect on November 24.

Trump has long accused Maduro of cartel links, calling him a “narcoterrorist.” Despite Maduro's denials of the allegations, Washington dispatched a naval armada to the western Caribbean earlier this year, and since September, US forces have hit alleged drug-smuggling vessels near Venezuela. US officials also say Trump is considering strikes on cartel targets inside the country.

The State Department reiterated the claim on Sunday that the Cartel de los Soles is led by the “illegitimate” President Maduro and senior Venezuelan officials.

It added that “neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,” accusing them of corrupting the country's institutions, directing “terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere,” and trafficking drugs into the US and Europe.

Trump said the designation would allow the US military to target assets of the cartel – and by extension, Maduro – and infrastructure in Venezuela. “It allows us to do that,” Trump told reporters on Sunday.

He added, however, that “we haven't said we're going to do that,” noting that the US “may be having some discussions with Maduro” first. “They would like to talk… we'll see how that turns out.”

Trump did not elaborate on potential talks. It is unclear why he said the designation would allow strikes, as it would not permit attacks without separate authorization.

Maduro has dismissed the allegations and the military buildup as an attempt to overthrow him, while urging Trump to negotiate. In September, he sent a letter to the White House in which he said Venezuela has dismantled the drug networks, offering direct talks.

Trump did not respond, though the White House claimed that the letter contained “a lot of lies.”

US Marines guarding the embassy in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, engaged in a shootout with suspected gang members last week, a military spokesman has said.

The Caribbean nation of almost 12 million has been gripped by violence since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021, with heavily armed criminal groups exploiting the power vacuum to increase their influence in Port-au-Prince and other areas. Haiti has been in a state of emergency for over a year.

The Marines returned fire after being targeted by suspected gang members late Thursday, US Marine spokesman Captain Steven J. Keenan said in a statement on Sunday.

There were no injuries among the US servicemen as a result of the incident, Keenan added.

The US State Department ordered nonessential US government employees and their families to leave Haiti in July 2023. It currently has a ‘Level 4: Do Not Travel' warning for the country, citing the risk of kidnapping, crime, terrorist activity, and civil unrest.

In June, the head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, Ghada Fathi Waly, said the gangs had “approximately 90% of Port-au-Prince... under their grip,” while expanding their attacks to other areas that were previously peaceful. Control over key trade routes by criminal groups has crippled legal commerce, driving up the cost of essential goods such as cooking fuel and rice, Waly added.

According to UN data, at least 5,600 people were killed in gang-related incidents in Haiti in 2024, with 1.3 million across the country being displaced due to the crisis.

A Kenyan-led, UN-supported mission, which arrived in Haiti in 2024 to help curb the violence, was able to free the presidential palace in the capital and unblock several key roads, but could not achieve further progress due to a reported lack of personnel and equipment. Only around 40% of the planned 2,500 troops were deployed, according to AP.

Last month, the UN Security Council decided to reorganize the mission into the Gang Suppression Force, to be composed of 5,500 soldiers and police officers.

US Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has apologized for her role in what she called “toxic politics,” amid an escalating feud with US President Donald Trump.

The Georgia lawmaker, known for her radical conservative views and combative speeches, has been increasingly critical of Trump, who she has passionately defended in the past. On Friday, Trump accused Greene of veering to the “far left” and branded her a “traitor.”

In an interview with CNN's ‘State of the Union' aired on Sunday, Greene said that while Trump's remarks were “hurtful,” she is determined to “end the fighting in politics.”

“The most hurtful thing Trump said, which is absolutely untrue, is he called me a traitor,” she said, warning that this type of language can “radicalize people” and put her life at risk.

“I would like to say, humbly, I'm sorry for taking part in the toxic politics. It's very bad for our country,” she said, adding that the uptick in political violence, including the assassination of conservative organizer and podcaster Charlie Kirk, prompted her to “put down the knives in politics.”

Greene said she will continue to fight for the release of all remaining unredacted files related to disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump has urged Republicans not to aid Democrats in spreading what he has called “the Epstein hoax,” arguing that his opponents are seeking to undermine his presidency.

Greene has also criticized US aid to Israel and Ukraine and claimed that Epstein may have been an Israeli agent.

President attempts to save face politically after pressuring Republicans to back off their pushes to release files

US politics live – latest updates

Donald Trump's call for Republicans to back the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, an abrupt reversal, is a rare instance of the president being unable to tame his Maga base and being instead forced to accede to it.

Many Republicans are expected to support a vote in the US House this week to force the justice department to release the files. Once the measure passes, it would still need approval in the US Senate, where 13 Republican senators would need to join with all 47 Democrats to approve it.

Trump spent last week aggressively squeezing allies in the US House, including Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, to back off in their support of releasing the files. Those efforts were unsuccessful, and when it became apparent the measure was going to pass, Trump backed it in an effort to salvage an embarrassing political loss. “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,” he posted on his Truth Social network on Sunday evening.

For years, Trump's Maga base, including people who now have prominent positions in his administration, have called for the release of the Epstein files, suggesting there was a conspiracy to protect the rich and powerful. Trump supported the release as a candidate. But earlier this year, the justice department said it had reviewed the files and would not be releasing more documents. That set off more furor and pressure on Trump to release them.

The House oversight committee last week released a tranche of documents they obtained from Epstein's estate, including messages in which Epstein wrote that Trump knew of Epstein's conduct. The messages also show Trump ally Steve Bannon advising Epstein on how to rehabilitate his image. Epstein further corresponded with other prominent people, including the former treasury secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers; the journalist Michael Wolff; and Kathryn Ruemmler, Barack Obama's former White House counsel.

The release of those messages has only further increased scrutiny on Trump, and built the pressure to release everything the government still has on Epstein – which could be quite a lot, given the number of federal investigations conducted into him.

Some Maga influencers have sought to pivot the story away from Trump. Megyn Kelly, the conservative radio host, appeared to question whether Epstein really was a pedophile. “There's a difference between a 15-year-old and a five-year-old,” she said on her podcast. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to one count of soliciting an underage prostitute and in 2019 faced federal sex trafficking charges for girls as young as 14. Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial.

The issue has ignited a bitter split with Marjorie Taylor Greene, a House representative of Georgia, who has increasingly styled herself as someone in touch with the real Maga base and has refused to blindly back Trump through the Epstein saga. “Releasing the Epstein files is the easiest thing in the world,” she told Politico on Friday. “Just release it all, let the American people sort through every bit of it, and, you know, support the victims. That's just like the most common sense, easiest thing in the world. But to spend any effort trying to stop it makes – it just doesn't make sense to me.”

Trump repeatedly attacked Greene over the weekend, calling her a “traitor”, amid other insults. Greene decried the president's rhetoric during an interview on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. “Those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,” she said.

Later that evening she posted on social media that she and her family had started receiving hoax pizza deliveries, and that there had been a pipe bomb threat directed at her construction company. Pressed on CNN about why she was speaking out against the president's rhetoric now, as she had not condemned his similarly viscous rhetoric in the past, she was evasive.

“I'm only responsible for myself and my own words and actions … and I've been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics,” she said. “I really want to just see people be kind to one another.” She also stressed during the interview that she continued to support the president and his administration.

But whether Trump's reversal will effectively quell the pressure from his base, or if he'll continue to feel the heat – including from some of his otherwise staunchest allies – will be closely watched.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Lingering thunderstorms pose risk of mudslides in areas around Los Angeles recently ravaged by wildfires

A powerful atmospheric river weather system has mostly moved through California but not before causing at least six deaths and dousing much of the state.

Among the dead was a seven-year-old girl who was swept into the ocean by waves estimated up to 20ft at a state beach on Friday. The girl's father, 39-year-old Yuji Hu, of Calgary, Alberta, was killed while trying to save his daughter.

In northern California, in Sutter county, north of Sacramento, a 71-year-old man died after his vehicle was swept off a flooded bridge.

Much further south, a wooden boat believed to have been ferrying migrants toward the US from Mexico capsized in stormy seas off the coast of San Diego, leaving at least four people dead and four hospitalized.

The long plume of tropical moisture that formed over the Pacific Ocean began drenching the San Francisco Bay Area last Wednesday night and then unleashed widespread rain over southern California on Friday and Saturday.

Downtown LA saw more rain than any previous November, breaking a record previously set in 1985, the Los Angeles Times reported.

On Monday, lingering thunderstorms continued to pose the risk of mudslides in areas of Los Angeles county that were recently ravaged by wildfire.

“Due to the abundant rainfall the past couple of days, it will not take as much rainfall to cause additional flooding/rockslide conditions,” the National Weather Service said in a Sunday update. The agency advised the region on Monday to “be prepared for a soggy day”.

Rain was expected to continue through Tuesday, the weather service said, while another storm was forecast to arrive on Thursday.

South-east of Los Angeles there was flooding in the Palm Springs area and road closures throughout the desert area of the Coachella valley.

More than 4in of rain fell over coastal Santa Barbara county as the storm approached Los Angeles. Parts of the Sierra Nevada received more than a foot of snow.

Amid the climate crisis, warming oceans are supercharging such atmospheric river storms, making them deadlier and costlier.

Atmospheric rivers have long been important features of weather systems across the US west and are vital to replenishing the state's reservoirs and snowpack. But filled with enough moisture to rival flows at the mouth of the Mississippi – and often many times more – the strong systems that carry water across the Pacific also often cause the most destructive floods.

Robert Garcia, ranking member of House oversight committee, says president has ‘realized he is about to lose this Epstein vote' and calls for release of files

Trump urges Republicans to vote for release of Epstein files in surprise U-turn

Robert Garcia, the ranking member of the House oversight committee, which released the tranche of new Epstein documents last week, said that Donald Trump “has tried everything to kill our Jeffrey Epstein investigation”.

The Democrat went on to say: “Now [Trump's] panicking and has realized he is about to lose this Epstein vote to force the Department of Justice to release the files.

“Let's be crystal clear: Trump has the power to release all the files today,” Garcia added in a statment. “But instead, he wants to continue this cover-up and launch bogus new investigations to deflect and slow down our investigation. It won't work. We will get justice for the survivors.”

A US judge has found evidence of “government misconduct” in how a prosecutor aligned with Donald Trump secured criminal charges against former FBI director James Comey and ordered that grand jury materials be turned over to Comey's defense team.

Last week, prosecutors were ordered to produce a trove of materials from the investigation, with the court saying it was concerned that the US justice department's position on Comey had been to “indict first and investigate later”.

Comey is charged with lying to Congress in 2020 in a case filed days after the US president appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute the former FBI director and other perceived political enemies. He has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have argued that it is a vindictive prosecution brought at the direction of the Republican president and must be dismissed.

Former national security adviser and noted Trump adversary John Bolton said that he supports “the idea of returning the government of Venezuela to its own people” in an interview with CNN today. But he remains “troubled” because he doesn't “see what the plan is”.

He added:

If it's simply about illegal narcotics, that's one thing. But it seems to be about overthrowing Maduro. Why else bring the Gerald R Ford carrier strike group from the European theater to the Caribbean? Trump has now put the gun on the table. The question is, is he going to use it or not?

It's worth remembering that FBI searched Bolton's home earlier this year, and he was later charged with transmitting and retaining highly classified information under the Espionage Act. He pleaded not guilty, following his indictment last month.

Several of Jeffrey Epstein's survivors appear in a new public service announcement to encourage House lawmakers to vote for the complete release of justice department files on the late sex offender.

In the video, produced by anti-trafficking organization World Without Exploitation, the survivors hold pictures of their younger selves. “It's time to bring the secrets out of the shadows,” one says. The video ends with the screen reading: “Five administrations and we're still in the dark.”

Robert Garcia, the ranking member of the House oversight committee, which released the tranche of new Epstein documents last week, said that Donald Trump “has tried everything to kill our Jeffrey Epstein investigation”.

The Democrat went on to say: “Now [Trump's] panicking and has realized he is about to lose this Epstein vote to force the Department of Justice to release the files.

“Let's be crystal clear: Trump has the power to release all the files today,” Garcia added in a statment. “But instead, he wants to continue this cover-up and launch bogus new investigations to deflect and slow down our investigation. It won't work. We will get justice for the survivors.”

The US has said it will designate a putative Venezuelan drug cartel allegedly led by Nicolás Maduro as a foreign terrorist organization, as the Trump administration sent more mixed messages over its crusade against Venezuela's authoritarian leader.

The move to target the already proscribed group, the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns), was announced by Marco Rubio on Sunday. “Headed by the illegitimate Nicolás Maduro, the group has corrupted the institutions of government in Venezuela and is responsible for terrorist violence conducted by and with other designated FTOs as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe,” the US secretary of state tweeted, generating excitement among hardline adversaries of Maduro who interpreted the announcement as proof Washington was preparing to intensify its push to force the South American dictator from power.

But shortly after Rubio's pronouncement, those hopes were undermined when Trump hinted he might be prepared to negotiate with Maduro representatives. “We may be having some conversations with Maduro, and we'll see how that turns out. They would like to talk,” Trump told reporters.

As we reported earlier, 81 people were arrested by Customs and Border Protection officers in Charlotte, North Carolina, over the weekend. My colleague Victoria Bouloubasis reports that the Meckenburg county sheriff, Gary McFadden, said on Sunday that he was not surprised by federal agents' actions this weekend. “This is something I have seen, something I have been battling repeatedly,” he said.

McFadden confirmed that his office will not assist ICE or border patrol with law enforcement actions. That also means the county cannot intervene in any federal arrests.

“Border patrol are going to do what they are being tasked to do. We cannot stop that,” he said. “I would suggest that people stay out of their way.”

The sheriff, who is Black, acknowledged that “some communities welcome this” in Mecklenburg county “and the others are living in fear and anxiety for the rest of this week, maybe the rest of this year. Mentally it's unbelievable to live in fear every day. African Americans can maybe understand it a little better than other people.”

Joe Walsh, the former Republican congressman from Illinois, has offered some words of advice to Marjorie Taylor Greene, as she continues to speak out against Donald Trump's claims that she's a “traitor” for pushing for the complete release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

“As a onetime divisive right-wing political asshole, I publicly came out against Trump & stopped being a divisive asshole over 7yrs ago,” Walsh wrote. A reminder, that the former representative was a loyal Republican until the end of Trump's first term when he mounted a short-lived primary challenge against the president in 2020. Walsh has since been a vocal critic of the Trump administration and became a registered Democrat this year.

“I've spent every day these past 7yrs proving the sincerity of my conversion, and doing all I can to defeat Trump/Trumpism. MTG will have to walk down this same road,” he added in his post on X.“ I appreciate her pledging to no longer be a divisive asshole, but now she's gotta prove it.”

The BBC chair, Samir Shah, has told staff that the corporation is “determined” to fight any defamation action brought by Donald Trump. The president has no case, Shah says.

In a note to staff seen by PA Media, Shah says:

There is a lot being written, said and speculated upon about the possibility of legal action, including potential costs or settlements.

In all this we are, of course, acutely aware of the privilege of our funding and the need to protect our licence fee payers, the British public.

I want to be very clear with you – our position has not changed. There is no basis for a defamation case and we are determined to fight this.

Last week I took the opportunity to speak with the executive team and am reassured of their resolute focus on ensuring the BBC continues to deliver on behalf of audiences and staff.

I know they plan to spend as much time as possible with their teams over the coming weeks to reinforce the importance of that work and answer your questions.

As her fallout with the president continues over her push for the full release of the Epstein files, Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said that the “hoax pizza deliveries have started now, to my house and my family members”.

She also noted that her construction company's office building received a “pipe bomb threat”.

“Unfortunately, I've been down this road before. As a matter of fact, as I campaigned all over the country and defended President Trump, I received dozens of swatting calls on my house,” the lawmaker said in a post on X. “When the President of the United States irresponsibly calls a Member of Congress of his own party, traitor, he is signaling what must be done to a traitor.”

Donald Trump is in Washington today. As we noted earlier, he'll hold a meeting with the 2026 World Cup taskforce in the Oval Office at 2pm ET. We'll bring you the latest lines from that meeting, particularly as it will be the first event open to the press since the president's apparent U-turn on the House releasing the Epstein files.

Later, Trump will deliver remarks at McDonald's impact summit. This will be in DC, and there will be a number of Democratic leaders speaking and in attendance.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The number of workers on unpaid leave due to US tariffs fell slightly in the first half of this month, thanks to a recovery in orders, the Ministry of Labor said yesterday.

The number of workers impacted by tariffs fell to 7,530 as of Saturday, down by 45 from the end of last month, the ministry said, adding that the number of employers carrying out furlough programs also declined by 17 to 353.

Labor Conditions and Employment Equality specialist Li Yi-hsuan (李怡萱) said the data indicated that employment in the local export-oriented manufacturing sector was stabilizing, on the back of an increase in orders.

The manufacturing sector recorded the largest number of furloughed workers at 7,923, accounting for about 94 percent of the total, ministry data showed.

The metal and electric machinery industry reported the highest number of furloughed workers at 6,029, with 283 employers implementing furlough programs, Li said.

The service sector stayed stable, with the number of workers on unpaid leave in the wholesale and retail industry remaining at 338, while the figure for the lodging, and food and beverage industry fell one to 32, data showed.

The total number of furloughed workers across the country was 8,456, up by 125 from the end of last month, while the number of employers implementing unpaid leave programs fell by 20 to 435, ministry data showed.

As tariff negotiations between Taiwan and the US are still ongoing, with Taipei aiming to lower the 20 percent tariff, the ministry will continue to closely watch the job market, Li said.

The ministry updates its furloughed worker data on the first and 16th of every month.

Most of the enterprises implementing furlough programs are small companies that employ fewer than 50 people.

Unpaid leave programs typically last less than three months, with employees taking five to eight days of unpaid leave per month, the ministry said.

Russia's largest silicon plant, Kremniy, will halt production on Jan. 1, 2026, due to collapsing demand and rising competition from cheaper imports, Russian mining giant Rusal told state news agency RIA Novosti on Nov. 17.

The shutdown underscores the mounting pressure on major Russian industrial producers as the economy slows, exports fall, and domestic demand stagnates.

Kremniy, located in east-central Irkutsk Oblast, is the country's largest refined silicon producer with a yearly capacity of 34,000 metric tons. Rusal said imported silicon has become significantly cheaper than domestic output, undercutting the plant's competitiveness. 

""Due to global silicon overproduction and the growth of silicon imports at dumping prices to Russia, the Kremniy plant is forced to suspend production,"" the company told RIA Novosti. 

Supplies from abroad continue to grow, while Russian silicon faces weak demand in global markets.

Rusal said it notified the Irkutsk Oblast authorities about the upcoming shutdown and expressed hope that officials will assist in managing the ""social consequences"" for workers.

The company's second facility, Kremniy Ural, which has a capacity of 27,000 metric tons, will continue operating but at a reduced rate. Rusal previously announced it would cut silicon production by 35% in 2025, down to 35,000 metric tons, due to growing pressure from Chinese producers.

Russia's domestic market can absorb roughly 45,000 metric tons of silicon per year. At full capacity, Kremniy and Kremniy Ural must export a portion of their combined output — a challenge as international buyers shift away from Russian suppliers.

Rusal, one of the world's largest aluminum producers, is controlled by Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire long seen as part of the business elite sustained by Russian President Vladimir Putin's patronage system.

At least a dozen Russian companies across multiple sectors have already shortened the workweek to reduce labor costs, as industrial output continues to weaken and export revenues decline.

Prominent Ukrainian activist and volunteer Serhii Sternenko criticized his country's military and political leadership on Nov. 17, warning that ""we are headed toward a disaster of strategic magnitude, which could lead to the loss of statehood."" 

In an X post accompanied by screenshots of a critical Facebook post by a Ukrainian journalist, Sternenko stressed that remaining silent about the issues with Ukraine's military and political approach to the country's defense ""is a crime."" 

""Our defense is falling apart,"" Sternenko, who works closely with various military units to supply their immediate needs, such as drones, said. ""Under a stunning silence about it."" 

Sternenko's warning comes as Russian troops pierce through Ukrainian defenses on multiple hot spot sectors of the war, including Pokrovsk in eastern Donetsk Oblast and near the town of Huliaipole in southeastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast. 

This year alone, Russia has been able to suddenly open new fronts in areas that were once far from the fighting, such as in Dnipropetrovsk and Sumy oblasts, raising concerns about Ukraine's ability to prepare and build fortifications — and learn from its repeating mistakes. 

Without significant changes in both the military and political leadership, the possibility of Russian tanks hypothetically reaching cities such as Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia is ""only a matter of time,"" Sternenko warned. 

Dnipro is a major logistics hub for the Ukrainian army located over 110 kilometers (about 70 miles) from the fighting, whereas Zaporizhzhia is only about 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) away. 

Sternenko didn't elaborate on the issues he's referring to or suggest solutions for the military or political leadership. There was no immediate reaction from either of the leaderships. The Kyiv Independent reached out to Sternenko but was declined an immediate comment. 

Sternenko attached screenshots from well-known Ukrainian war reporter Anna Kaliuzhna's Facebook post, in which she criticized the Ukrainian military leadership's allocation of limited manpower resources, especially the cost of ""scaling up assault troops at the expense of bleeding the brigades dry.""

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) on Nov. 17 published new data on foreign equipment that Russia uses in weapon production, focusing on Eastern Asian companies, including the Japanese Okuma Corporation, Korean Samsung Machine Engineering Company, and Taiwanese AKIRA SEIKI.

HUR said that its list of equipment from Eastern Asian companies is helping Moscow produce a Unified Module for Gliding and Guidance (UMPK) kit for glide bombs, as well as missiles and artillery ammunition. 

Ukraine has long highlighted Western and foreign components used in Russian weapons to call for tougher sanctions that would make it more difficult for Moscow to circumvent them. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky said in October, for instance, that the missiles and drones that Russia used to attack Ukraine on Oct. 5 ""contained over 100,000 foreign-made components,"" including those from American, German, and British companies. 

""The data obtained is already being used to develop sanctions initiatives and restrict the production capacity of the Russian military-industrial complex,"" HUR said in its Nov. 17 Telegram post. 

Japanese Okuma and Chinese Hision machining centers' equipment were included in the newly released data. HUR claimed that Russia's Tactical Missile Armament Corporation is using them to produce planning and correction modules for weapons, such as glide bombs and cruise missiles.

Another Japanese machining center, Matsuura Machinery Corporation, was also in the list, with HUR claiming that the company's equipment is helping Russia produce missiles that regularly hit Ukraine, such as Kh-59 and Kh-101. 

Equipment from Korean Samsung Machine Engineering Company (SMEC) is also used by Russia to produce the external structure for unguided missiles, as well as large and medium caliber shells, according to HUR. 

Taiwanese AKIRA SEIKI's equipment, HUR claimed, is used by the Russian defense enterprise Burevestnik stabilizers for mortar rounds.

Aside from East Asian companies, which also included Chinese ones, the new data released also named three Czech companies and a German company's equipment for aiding Russian weapon production.

Bangladesh's ousted prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, was sentenced to death in her absence on Monday at the end of a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year.

People in the packed courtroom – including families of victims – cheered and clapped, and some in the crowds outside sank to their knees and offered up prayers after the verdict, the harshest against a leader in the country's history.

Hasina – who fled to neighbouring India in August, 2024 at the height of the uprising against her government – issued a statement dismissing the court as a “rigged tribunal.”

The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus described it as an “historic verdict,” but called for calm and warned that it would deal with any disorder.

After the verdict, the Bangladeshi foreign ministry called on India to extradite Hasina and former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, who was also sentenced to death in the same case. India said it noted the verdict and would “engage constructively,” without going into more detail.

Earlier on Monday, police clashed with protesters demanding the demolition of what remains of the house of Hasina's father in Dhaka. Much of it was destroyed last year.

Police and paramilitary forces were deployed around government buildings and the tribunal complex, and there was tight security across the capital and other major cities.

The verdict by the International Crimes Tribunal – Bangladesh's domestic war crimes court – comes ahead of elections in February. Hasina's son warned on Sunday there could be violence if a ban on her Awami League party taking part was not lifted.

A United Nations report estimated that up to 1,400 people were killed and thousands wounded – most by gunfire from security forces – during the anti-government demonstrations between July 15 and August 5 last year, the worst political violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence.

Judge Golam Mortuza Mozumder said Hasina, 78, was found guilty on three counts including incitement, ordering killings and failing to prevent atrocities during the uprising.

“We have decided to inflict her with only one sentence – that is, sentence of death,” Mozumder said.

In an e-mailed statement sent to media after the verdict, Hasina accused the court of being “biased and politically motivated.”

“In their distasteful call for the death penalty, they reveal the brazen and murderous intent of extremist figures within the interim government to remove Bangladesh's last elected prime minister, and to nullify the Awami League as a political force,” she said.

The government had earlier dismissed her criticisms of the legal proceedings, saying the tribunal had been transparent, allowed observers and published regular documentation.

The interim government urged Bangladeshis to remain calm. The judgment “may naturally evoke strong emotions among the public”, it said. “Any attempt to create disorder, chaos, or disturb public order will be dealt with strictly,” it added.

Bangladesh was tense ahead of the ruling, with at least 30 crude bomb explosions and 26 vehicles torched across the country over the past few days. There were no reported casualties.

“The path ahead requires not just legal accountability but rebuilding trust between institutions and citizens,” interim leader Yunus said in a statement after the verdict.

During the trial, prosecutors told the court that they had evidence of a direct command from Hasina to use lethal force to suppress the student-led uprising.

Hasina was represented by a state-appointed defence counsel who told the court that the charges against her were baseless and called for her acquittal.

The interim administration has governed the Muslim-majority South Asian country of 170 million people since Hasina fled.

Military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad was sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in 1991 for illegally possessing firearms.

Bangladesh is one of the world's largest garment exporters, supplying major global brands. The industry was hit hard by last year's protests.

Deagreez/AFP/Getty Images

More than a year ago, when the world was a brighter and less orange place, The Globe and Mail ran a simple, modest series. It was called “Prosperity's Path.” Over five essays, the scholar Dan Breznitz laid bare all that was wrong with Canada's economy and explained how to fix it. (Did you know that Canada is among the world's top 10 exporters of stolen cars?) 

We now revive that series, because the world has changed, and yet the original sins of the Canadian economy have not. With a hostile United States, this country's problems have only gotten more visible, more numerous and worse. A rotating cast, from The Globe and beyond, will offer solutions on how this country can get back onto prosperity's path. 

Today, to kick things off, we talk about the word of the season, “sacrifice”: why we need it, why we haven't done it and how we can achieve it.

Prime Minister Mark Carney beat this drum until it broke: As U.S. President Donald Trump threatens Canada's economy and sovereignty, this country must spend more defending both and less on social programs and such. 

Mr. Carney is not wrong. America's second president, John Adams, once told his wife: “I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy … in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music.” 

Opinion: Ottawa again asks younger Canadians to make sacrifices for financially comfortable retirees

We are not, as Mr. Adams was, amid war. But arguably we are not at peace either. So, yes, we must have fewer nice things. If we sacrifice now to invest in the future, maybe our children can have those nice things.

But where exactly is the sacrifice? The budget, to be voted on by MPs on Monday, had much-hyped cuts to the public service. But there were no major tax hikes or cuts to social programs. The budget had nearly $90-billion in net new spending. To pay for that, we borrow on the bond market. Canadians down the line pay that back.

Canada's books are relatively good, and the government says we'll borrow less next year. But we say that year after year, announce more borrowing and shift the goalposts. The trend is worrying. In Britain and France, debt devastates state capacity and breeds instability because those countries once thought their books were good, too.

Instead of asking what we can do for future generations, we asked what future generations can do for us. That is not sacrifice. A prebudget Globe editorial cartoon was surprisingly prescient: It showed kids handing Mr. Carney their Halloween candy. 

If we want to, in Mr. Carney's words, “invest more” and “reinvest in the Canadian Armed Forces,” we should pay for today's spending today. The cuts to the public service are positive. Ideally, we should cut more, such as from Old Age Security, which benefits rich as well as poor retirees. But OAS seems a sacred cow no party dares touch. Indeed, a lot of federal spending covers various benefits, health care and social services – politically impossible to cut.

That leaves raising taxes, and we can choose the least painful path: Raise the goods and services tax. Let's bring GST back to the 7 per cent it was when then prime minister Brian Mulroney introduced it in 1991.

It's not a radical idea. Many think tanks have called for it. A broad consensus of economists, policy experts, former government officials and chief executives is supportive. Many economists agree that taxing consumption does less to hurt productivity than taxing income.

According to Ottawa, one percentage point of GST is worth more than $10-billion a year in federal tax revenue. Extrapolating from that, a two-percentage-point hike for five years is north of $100-billion. That's more than the entire net new spending of the budget.

If we say Canada can borrow more because it has not borrowed as much as European countries, we should also compare consumption-tax levels. Canada's GST is relatively low, even if provincial sales taxes are factored in. In Nordic countries it's as high as 25 per cent.

There is a success story right there in the old country. Ireland gives tax incentives for business investment, but that is balanced by consumption taxes as high as 23 per cent. From 1995 all the way up to the 2008 financial crisis, Ireland's economy grew 6 to 10 per cent per year, on average. 

Yes, we are in a period of rank inflation and economic turmoil. Prebudget surveys showed that sacrifice is not popular. Moreover, a consumption tax is inherently regressive. 

But let's not forget that in Canada consumption taxes are not charged on necessities such as groceries, and lower-income folks get some back via the GST credit payment. If we worry about the regressive impact of a higher GST, we can always up the credit.

And the government can do a better job of selling the GST hike. What makes a magician successful is showmanship, after all, and not necessarily the specific trick performed.

This goes back to that word: sacrifice. That's what carbon taxes are. We pay a cost today so that our children won't have to tomorrow. The problem is that, especially for the consumer-facing version, Ottawa couldn't make people see it. The main benefit was abstract but the cost tangible. The secondary benefit, the rebate, was sneaked electronically into bank accounts under the nondescript description “CANADA FED.”

Contrast that with Ontario's $200 Ford-bucks affordability boost. Cheques came in the mail with a letter explicitly saying that benevolent leaders on Mt. Olympus have bestowed this great boon. And consider Signmyrocket.com, a Ukrainian crowdfunding campaign that writes donor messages on rockets and sends photographic proof before firing them at Russia.

Shannon Proudfoot: Carney's budget is a manifesto of ‘no'

Ottawa should pre-give some of the rebate from the higher GST immediately in the same cheque-and-letter format. And Ottawa must identify a firm spending area for the additional GST and be loud about it.

Michael Wernick, former clerk of the privy council, has suggested a 2-per-cent “defence and security” consumption tax. It's really just a GST hike, but his proposal labels where the money goes and separates it. Does it have to be defence? No. Money is fungible. Could be infrastructure. Could be a sovereignty tax. What is important is that this 2 per cent doesn't diffuse into general revenue, as the GST does.

Whatever that spending area, this tax should be clearly labelled such on receipts. And the cheque and letter sent should not only elaborate in detail what that additional GST buys but also include a personal thank you from a real person. If it's a defence tax, the thank you could be from a soldier. We can go even further and have high-schoolers pitch in, thanking taxpayers for not saddling them with debt in the future. 

It's been done. For funded writing residencies and academic prizes, recipients are encouraged to write such thank yous to donors. It can be effective.

The cornerstone of a popular mandate is transparency. People are more willing to spend if they know where their money is going, believe that it is the right expenditure and see the impact of it. Ottawa needs to make Canadians see this, because it needs to hike the GST. Ultimately, a sacrifice is not a sacrifice if nothing is given up.

It's a viral claim with millions of views: Brazil allegedly chopped down trees in the Amazon rainforest to build a highway to the COP30 climate conference. As DW can show, the claim is misleading.

World leaders, policy makers and environmentalists are currently gathering in Belem, Brazil, to discuss climate change. But every year, the World Climate Conference, or COP, also sparks criticism as thousands of attendees travel from around the world to be there. At this year's event, dubbed COP30, one criticism in particular went viral on social media.

Claim: Amazon rain forest was felled to build a highway for COP30.

DW Fact check: Misleading

This claim has already been circulating for eight months but is currently regaining momentum while the conference is on. Some social media posts with this claim are getting more than a million views.

Among the most prominent figures sharing the claim is US President Donald Trump who wrote on his own social media platform, Truth Social: ""They ripped the hell out of the Rainforest of Brazil to build a four lane highway for Environmentalists to travel. It's become a big scandal!""

Conservative commentators like Chris Kenny of Sky News Australia have used the highway to criticize ""alarmism and moral panic"" about climate change at the United Nations.

But the reality behind these viral claims is more complex than the posts on social media make out.

Yes, it is true, parts of the rain forest were felled to build a four-lane highway approximately 13.2 kilometers long close to Belem. The highway is called Avenida Liberdade. But, according to local officials, this was not done just for COP30. Plans for construction of a highway here date back to 2012, long before Belem was chosen to host this year's conference. However other media have reported that the highway is linked to this year's conference.

It seems pedantic to discuss whether the highway was built for COP30 or not, right? But it is important because the criticism serves an anti-climate action narrative.

A recent investigationby the Eurovision News Spotlight, a fact-checking network created by Eurovision News in collaboration with members of the European Broadcasting Union, found that the construction of Avenida Liberdade is seen as part of what's known as an ""authenticity gap"" around climate summits.

""This view thrives on the event's bad optics, where readily available media images — delegates flying private, staying in luxury, and using motorcades — overshadow the slow, intricate and less visually engaging work of the actual negotiations,"" the Spotlight researchers reported, after analyzing 70,000 posts on social media platform, X (formerly Twitter). ""International climate conferences like COP30 are structurally vulnerable because they require extensive, high-carbon logistics.""

The Avenida Liberdade highway became an easy target for criticism as it seems to contradict the conference's core mission of reducing global emissions. Those who oppose climate action are ""transforming these logistical flaws into intentional symbols of elite corruption,"" the analysis found.

People who have shared the claims about Avenida Liberdade regularly used words like hypocrisy, scamor scandal.

That is why the bigger picture is important. Let's take a look at the details.

Belem, the capital of the Brazilian state of Para, is often called the gateway to the lower Amazon, where the river slows before meeting the Atlantic.

One of the most important routes into Belem is BR-316, a key highway that often experiences heavy congestion. Plans for an alternative route to Belem date back over a decade and evolved into the Avenida Liberdade project.

The highway project, which was officially announced in 2020, has been the subject of controversy, protest and even lawsuits for several years. Construction began in June 2024.

But certainly, the highway idea did not originate with COP30, as Ana Claudia Cardoso, a professor of urban studies at the Federal University of Para told news agency Reuters in March.

""There's been talk about that project for over 20 years, but there was a lot of resistance,"" she said. ""The need to prepare the city for a mega event ends up giving the necessary justification.""

The Para state governmentdescribes the Avenida Liberdade highway as a sustainable project. It aimsto lower carbon emissions by reducing travel time and will also feature wildlife crossings, bike lanes and solar-powered lighting to minimize environmental impact.

The area where the Avenida Liberdade highway is being built is protected but it is not untouched rainforest. The area is what is known in Brazil as an State Environmental Protection Area (APA), a categorythat allows limited, sustainable use and controlled human activity.

The highway route follows an existing power cable line, where vegetation had already been cleared even before construction started, the government of Parasays. This can be seen in satellite images. 

The area also includes major infrastructure and buildings such as the Federal Rural University of Amazonia.

However experts have warned that nearby Utinga State Park and wildlife in the area could suffer impacts from more noise, pollution and urban expansion facilitated by the road.

While the government claims it consulted involved communities, there have been protests. In October 2024, construction was briefly stopped after local communities demanded to be consulted. In July 2025, the same communities again halted work, calling for compensation for land taken and improvements to access roads for their community as these had been damaged by heavy machinery.

Many people sharing the criticism on social media — that rain forest was cleared because of COP30 — refer to the UK public broadcaster, the BBC, as a source.

In March this year, the BBC published an articleheadlined, ""Amazon forest felled to build road for climate summit,"" with corresponding videoson different platforms, in different languages.

In the article, it says that ""a new four-lane highway cutting through tens of thousands of acres of protected Amazon rainforest is being built for the COP30 climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belem.""

However after BBC published its story, officials in Brazil denied that the construction of the highway was linked to COP30.

The event organizers said the BBC's headline is ""misleadingly suggesting a connection between the construction project and the federal government's actions in preparing for the Conference."" According to their statement, Avenida Liberdade was not part of the 33 infrastructure projects planned for COP30.

A statement by the government of Para repeated this: ""The avenue is a project that began in 2020, even before Belem was chosen as the host city for COP.""

DW reached out to the BBC for reaction. ""The BBC report is based on state governments documents and an interview with a state government official — two of which directly link the project to COP30,"" a BBC spokesperson said.

According to the BBC's article, Adler Silveira, the state's infrastructure secretary, listed Avenida Liberdade as one of the projects happening in the city in preparation for COP30, a project which would also leave ""a legacy for the population.""

The BBC shared a longer extract of the interview with DW that supports this.

The BBC also points to a press release by the government of Para, dating back to November last year, titled, ""Infrastructure projects by the State Government for COP 30 are progressing in Belem.""

The press release included a paragraph talking about progress on the construction of Avenida Liberdade. However later the press release was changed and in the current version, accessible online, this paragraph has been deleted.

Archived versions of this website show that the paragraph was removed between  March 13 and March 14, meaning shortly after the BBC's story was published.

DW reached out as to the government of Para but had not received a response by the time of publication.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Germany news: Vice Chancellor Klingbeil in China for talks","https://www.dw.com/en/germany-news-vice-chancellor-klingbeil-in-china-for-talks/live-74771192","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 11:12:08 GMT","

The SPD's Lars Klingbeil is the first high-level visitor to China from the current Merz-led government. Meanwhile, the government announced an end to its partial arms embargo on Israel. DW has more.

German Vice Chancellor, and finance minister, Lars Klingbeil met with China's vice premier He Lifeng for talks on strengthening commerce while assuaging trade tensions and concerns over Germany's industrial sector. 

Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is continuing his tour of the Balkans, visiting possible future EU members.

He is set to hold talks in Montenegro, Albania and Serbia on Monday.

The German government also announced it was lifting a partial arms embargo on Israel.

Follow along for the latest stories from Germany on Monday, November 17:

Eleven people have been detained and questioned by police in Istanbul, Turkey, in the suspected poisoning deaths of a German-Turkish woman and her two small children ages six and three, according to Turkey's Anadolu news agency.

The three victims, as well as well as the woman's husband who died Monday evening after fighting for his life in an Istanbul hospital, fell ill Wednesday after having eaten street food from a vendor in the city's popular Ortakoy neighborhood on the banks of the Bosphorus River.

The children both died Thursday and the mother on Friday.

Although an investigation was opened into the food stand, authorities now believe the poisoning may have actually happened at their hotel.

Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper reported that a substance was sprayed in a room on the ground floor of the hotel that the family was staying in to combat a bed bug infestation. 

The pesticide may have reached the family's room on the next floor through a bathroom vent. 

The unnamed hotel was evacuated Saturday after two more guests were taken to hospital with similar symptoms, according to Anadolu.

The hotel was subsequently sealed off by municipal officials on Sunday. 
      
Authorities say that five food sellers, the hotel's owner and two staff, and three people from the pest control company have been questioned.

Eight of them were scheduled to appear before a judge on Monday. 
      
A toxicology report prepared by forensic experts was expected to be released later on Monday.

Food samples are being checked by experts at the agriculture ministry.

In a report commissioned by Berlin's Foreign Ministry, the German Economic Institute (IW) said Monday that China is ""flooding"" Germany and other European nations with goods as it diverts exports to the US as a result of a tariff war with President Donald Trump.

The study found that Chinese exports to Germany rose by 11% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same time in 2024 with prices dropping an average of 4%. 

In comparison, Chinese second quarter exports to the US fell 16%. 

China is not alone in shifting exports to Europe, putting further pressure on European producers.

Imports of Chinese hybrid electric cars, for instance, doubled in Q2, while exports of the same to the US were down 99%.

""As the US is further isolating itself from China, Germany is increasingly becoming an alternative market for Chinese companies,"" said Jürgen Matthes of IW.

The shift puts a further burden on Germany's car industry, which had invested in China for decades and is now being undercut by its EV imports.

The volume of trucks, sheet metal, foils, heating appliances, polyester and polyamide plastics as well as various other product groups imported into Germany also increased significantly, while at the same time those to the US nosedived.

Matthes said state largess and the undervaluing of the yuan mean that Chinese industry benefits from unfair competitive distortions, offering goods at extremely low prices. 

""Brussels must therefore focus more strongly and comprehensively on countervailing duties in order to restore fair competitive conditions,"" the IW expert demanded.

Chancellor Merz has taken part in a panel at an economic summit hosted by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.

He complained that the German economy has become ""too sluggish, too slow, too bureaucratic,"" according to the newspaper.

His plan to change that rests in large part on easing and digitalizing Germany's immigration policy, saying that the country needs more skilled migrants.

He defended his position on the so-called ""debt brake,"" saying he hadn't ""loosened"" it, but simply made two exceptions — for defense and for a special infrastructure investment fund — adding that this was a necessary step to boost growth and increase jobs.

The chancellor also complained about German savers who are afraid of investing. He said that around €2 billion was sitting in savings accounts.

""We want the money that's in Germany to be invested sensibly,"" he told the panel.

The German government announced on Monday that it was ending the partial suspension of weapons deliveries to Israel for use in Gaza.

""The government welcomes the ceasefire in Gaza that came into effect on October 10 and which has stabilized in recent weeks,"" spokesperson Stefan Kornelius said.

Read the full report on why Germany is lifting its partial arms embargo on Israel.

Vice Chancellor Klingbeil's first public comments upon his arrival in China have focused on the connections between Germany and China as well as their shared responsibilities.

""Germany and China together can find answers to the challenges of our time,"" he said ahead of the China-Germany Financial Dialogue in Beijing.

He pointed to German investments in expertise and engineering technology that helped boost China's growth and modernization as well as the important role Chinese suppliers play in German industrial value chains.

""The close trade relations between China and Germany over the past few decades also mean that we have a common responsibility,"" he added.

Police in the German capital Berlin said on Monday they had received over 900 calls about an alleged threat against dozens of schools.

A video that has been shared in numerous groups announcing planned attacks was deemed fake by police, but that hasn't quelled concerns.

Police said they believed the message to be ""false information deliberately intended to stir up fear."" 

""We have no indications of any danger or concrete threats,"" they said in a statement on Sunday, adding that schools would open as normal on Monday with officers on standby to respond if needed.

Reactions in chat groups where the video was shared indicated that parents were considering not sending their children to school.

One parent in the group said: ""My son showed me the video with the threat; he is scared, and so are his classmates. They will not go to school tomorrow. I am scared too. Please do something.""

Police have opened an investigation.

One in every seven (15.2%) children and young people in Germany was at risk of poverty in 2024, according to a new report from the Federal Office of Statistics (Destatis), based on data from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC).

That amounts to a total of 2.2 million people and marks an increase from 14% in 2023. However, it still remained below the EU average of 19.3%.

The EU-SILC calculates poverty risk as those with less than 60% of the median net equivalent income of the total population.

This amounts to anything less than a net €1,381 per month for a single person, €1,795 for a single parent with a child under 14, and €2,900 for households with two parents and two children under 14.

Young people from families with migrant backgrounds were four times as likely to be at risk of poverty.

The data also looks at material conditions related to poverty.

For example, 19% of under-16s were living in households that were unable to replace worn or broken furniture. Some 12% were in households that could not afford a weeklong holiday.

Around 5% were regularly unable to enjoy free time activities such as joining a sports club or going to the cinema due to financial limits, and around 3% could not afford two good pairs of shoes for everyday use.

Between 1% and 2% of under-16s were unable to invite friends over to play or to eat, not to host birthday parties or to access fresh fruit and vegetables daily.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz sought to put an end to an ongoing dispute with his party's own youth organization over a planned pension bill.

The Young Union is the youth organization for the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). Its members are aged between 18 and 35 years old, with 18 of its members sitting in the Bundestag as part of the coalition government.

The problem for Merz is that he only has a 12-seat majority and the Young Union opposes plans to keep the pension level to at least 48% of the average income until 2031 and to potentially increase this level by around 1 percentage point after that.

The Young Union has criticized the plan, saying it will incur high costs — citing ""added costs of more than €200 billion by 2040.""

They also expressed opposition to the ""mothers' pension,"" put forward by the CSU.

Merz has responded by calling the opposition to pension protections a vote loser and on Sunday he said in an interview the bill had been agreed on in the coalition agreement, which the Young Union also approved.

However, he offered a branch to the Young Union, saying that once this bill is passed, they could open a discussion on a systematic change to the system after 2031.

""I support the idea of fundamentally changing our pension system for the period after 2031,"" Merz told public broadcaster ARD on Sunday evening.

Germany's Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil was set to become the first representative from the current coalition government to visit China on Monday.

He is expected to discuss trade, with an emphasis on rare earth elements, with Chinese officials.

However, there will also be expectations that Klingbeil, who is also Germany's finance minister, can make headway in dealing with concerns over an increasing trade deficit with China and exposure to risks from its market.

""Access to critical raw materials and the reduction of Chinese overcapacity in sectors such as steel and electric mobility are of great importance for the economy and jobs in Germany,"" Klingbeil said before setting off.

Following the introduction of major and often-changing trade tariffs by the Trump administration in the US, Beijing overtook Washington as Berlin's largest trading partner for the first eight months of 2025.

The US-China trade war in particular has seen China seek to divest its exports to other markets, sparking fears in Europe of dumping that could undercut home-grown industries.

Germany is now facing a record trade deficit of €87 billion ($101 billion) with China, according to a forecast by state-owned international economic promotion agency Germany Trade & Invest, cited by Reuters.

This comes from a year-on-year 13.5% decline in German exports to China and an 8.3% increase in imports.

At the same time, China is a major supplier of rare earth materials and chips used in cars, both key to Germany's struggling industrial sector.

A dispute between China and the Netherlands, which led to Beijing placing a limit on the trade of rare earth materials, rang alarm bells in Europe.

Check out DW's analysis for a deeper dive on what can be expected from Klingbeil's visit to China.

Saudi officials did not immediately confirm the crash or any casualties. 

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said officials were in ""close contact"" with Saudi authorities. 

""My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones. I pray for the swift recovery of all those injured. Our Embassy in Riyadh and Consulate in Jeddah are providing all possible assistance,"" he wrote on social media. 

Indian broadcaster NDTV reported, citing witnesses, that the bus was in a collision with a tanker. 

Many of the passagers were reported to have originally been from the Indian city of Hyderabad, and were performing the Islamic pilgrimage known as Umrah in Saudi Arabia. 

V.C. Sajjanar,Hyderabad's police commissioner, said preliminary information indicated that 46 people were traveling in the bus.  

He told reporters that ""heartbreakingly, only one person survived.""

Footage circulating on social media appeared to show a massive fire rising, allegedly from the site of the crash. 

The Times of India paper quoted unnamed officials as saying that 46 passengers were aboard the bus while reportedly traveling from Mecca to Medina.

Muslims from around the world flock to Mecca, in Saudi Arabia's west, to perform Umrah, a shorter version of the annual Hajj pilgrimage. While Hajj takes place only at a specific time every year, Umrah can be performed year-round. 

Saudi Arabia is also home to a large Indian diaspora.

Donald Trump has urged Republicans to vote to release the remaining Jeffrey Epstein files in an about-turn.

The US president said that House Republicans should vote to publish the files on the late financier and convicted paedophile this week “because we have nothing to hide”.

Mr Trump had previously lobbied hard to prevent the remaining documents from being released after 23,000 were published last week.

He described the files as a “Democrat hoax” and ordered an investigation into Bill Clinton, the former president, following a meeting with officials in the Situation Room, a secure location usually reserved for top secret meetings about military operations and national security.

But in the face of a growing rebellion Mr Trump changed his stance on Sunday night.

“House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown',” Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“The House Oversight Committee can have whatever they are legally entitled to, I DON'T CARE! All I do care about is that Republicans get BACK ON POINT.”

The display of defiance from congressional Republicans had left Mr Trump on course for almost certain defeat.

His about-turn appears to be a face-saving exercise, as well as an attempt to neutralise an issue that has provoked backlash from his Maga base.

After a series of Republican candidates were defeated in state and local elections this month, putting the Epstein saga to bed will also allow the president to focus on issues such as affordability before the 2026 midterms.

On Sunday, Mr Trump told Republicans not to “fall into the Epstein ‘TRAP'”, urging them to talk up his administration's record on the economy, deportations, border security and “stopping transgender for everyone”.

“If the Democrats had anything, they would have released it before our landslide election victory,” he added.

On Monday morning, Mr Trump went on to claim Democrats should be prosecuted for their “sleazy relationships with Epstein”.

“It's a Democrat hoax for purposes of deflection, just like the Russia, Russia, Russia scam!” he added, referring to the probe into alleged collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian intelligence.

Republicans already released 23,000 documents pertaining to Epstein, including a raft of emails in which Mr Trump is mentioned. Those files were said to represent less than one per cent of the evidence the government had collected about Epstein, who died in his prison cell in 2019.

One email released last week showed Epstein wrote to a journalist: “Of course he [Trump] knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine [Maxwell] to stop.”

Mr Trump has also always denied any knowledge of or involvement with Epstein's sex-trafficking or abuse of underage girls.

In another email to Maxwell, his convicted accomplice, Epstein wrote: “I want you to realise that the dog that hasn't barked is Trump.”

“[Giuffre] spent hours at my house with him, he has never once been mentioned,” he added, referring to the late Virginia Giuffre, who accused Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor of sexual abuse before taking her own life in April. The former prince denies all allegations against him.

Mr Trump has repeatedly labelled claims he was hiding information about his relationship with Epstein a “hoax” and pointed out that the files implicated his political rivals.

On Sunday night, he named Mr Clinton, Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn, and Larry Summers, the former US treasurer, among “Democrat operatives” investigated over their relationship with Epstein.

Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman, said the investigation into Democrats could be a “last-ditch effort to prevent the release of the Epstein files”.

Mr Massie told ABC News on Sunday: “If they have ongoing investigations in certain areas, those documents can't be released.

“So, this might be a big smokescreen, these investigations, to open a bunch of them, as a last-ditch effort to prevent the release of the Epstein files.”

Mr Massie predicted a “deluge of Republicans” would support his push to release the files, suggesting there could be enough to block the president vetoing the move.

Before Mr Trump's about-turn, Mike Johnson, the House speaker, conceded on Sunday that “lots” of Republicans would support the bill.

Chuck Schumer, the Democrat leader in the Senate, noted that the vote in Congress was only necessary because the Trump administration had refused to publish the full Epstein files.

“The vote is to compel YOU to release them,” he wrote on social media. “Let's make this easier. Just release the files now.”The House is due to vote on publishing the files on Tuesday. No vote has been scheduled in the Senate, which would also have to pass the bill and means the timeline of any release is unclear.

More than 100 Republicans are expected to support the release of the remaining files.

Anger has been building since July when the Trump administration suddenly aborted its pledge to release all of the Epstein evidence and closed its investigation.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican congresswoman, claimed over the weekend that Mr Trump was inciting death threats against her after she called on him to release the rest of the files.

On Sunday, she said she had been the victim of “pizza doxxing”, where pizzas are ordered to an individual's home in an attempt to intimidate them, and that her construction company had received a pipe-bomb threat.

She criticised Mr Trump, formerly a close political ally, for “unwarranted and vicious attacks” that act as a “dog whistle to dangerous radicals that could lead to serious attacks on me and my family”.

Hours later, the president said: “Wacky Marjorie ‘Traitor' Brown (Remember, Green turns to Brown where there is ROT involved!) is working overtime to try and portray herself as a victim… she is the cause of all her problems.”

About two-thirds of voters in Ecuador on Sunday opposed the measure pushed by right-wing President Daniel Noboa.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

Ecuador's voters on Sunday delivered a major blow to right-wing President Daniel Noboa by decisively rejecting the proposed return of foreign military bases to the South American country's soil — including installations run by the United States.

Around two-thirds of voters opposed the measure with most ballots tallied, a result that was widely seen as a surprise. Voters also rejected a separate effort to rewrite the country's progressive 2008 constitution, which enshrined strong labor and environmental rights.

The stinging defeat for Noboa, an ally of US President Donald Trump, comes as the United States carries out an aggressive military buildup and deadly airstrike campaign in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific — and weighs a direct attack on Venezuela. The BBC reported that the Trump administration “had hoped the referendum would pave the way to opening a military base in Ecuador, 16 years after it was made to close a site on its Pacific coast.”

“The former US military base on Ecuador's Pacific coast was closed after left-wing President Rafael Correa decided not to renew its lease and pushed for the constitutional ban,” the outlet noted.

Correa celebrated Sunday's results in a social media post, expressing hope that the vote would mark “the beginning of a definitive constitutional stability for the country.”

“Our constitution is one of the best in the world; we just need to comply with it,” he wrote.

The vote followed a recent trip to Ecuador by US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, a prominent figure in the Trump administration's lawless assault in immigrants in the United States. The Trump administration and Noboa's government have ramped up cooperation efforts in recent months, and both governments have unleashed military forces on their own citizens, illegally repressed protests, and carried out enforced disappearances and other grave human rights violations.

During her visit to Ecuador earlier this month, Noem toured the site of what Noboa's office described as a potential US military base in the port city of Manta.

The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) said in a statement late Sunday that “by inviting direct US military involvement and permanent presence in military bases — framed as a partnership to combat drug trafficking and organized crime — Noboa has tied the country's safety and sovereignty to Washington's regional ambitions.”

“Today's ‘no' vote therefore underscores widespread public unease with that approach and reflects the Ecuadorian people's skepticism toward the government's heavy reliance on the Trump administration's support,” CEPR continued. “More generally, this vote raises questions about the effects and popularity of the last few years of security rapprochement and cooperation between Ecuador and the United States, which include, among other agreements, a Statute of Forces Agreement signed in 2023 that enables the presence of — and grants immunity to — US forces in Ecuador.”

“It is, to date, the Noboa government's biggest electoral defeat,” the group added.

There is no significant relationship between immigration rates and rising housing costs in the US, experts have said.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

In an interview with Fox News last week, Vice President JD Vance downplayed the significance of rising inflation and costs for consumer goods in the U.S., claiming that any price increases are not due to Trump administration policies. 

Unlike President Donald Trump, Vance recognized that costs were up compared to last year. But he blamed former President Joe Biden for the increases.

The Trump White House “inherited this terrible inflation crisis from the Biden administration,” Vance said.

The vice president then blamed immigrants for the administration's lack of action to make housing more affordable. (A new report from the National Association of Realtors, published earlier this month, notes that the median age of homebuyers in the U.S. is now 40 years old — the highest age ever recorded by the organization.)

“A lot of young people are saying, ‘Housing is way too expensive.' Why is that? Because we flooded the country with 30 million illegal immigrants who are taking houses that ought, by right, go to American citizens,” Vance said. 

This claim — frequently peddled by Vance and Trump to deflect blame for the state of the economy — is blatantly false, housing and immigration experts say.

There is “no significant relationship between unauthorized immigrants and general house price growth for each state in the U.S.,” said a joint study from researchers at Texas A&M and the University of Maine published earlier this year.

The National Immigration Forum similarly blasted such reasoning in an explainer on the subject last month, stating:

While immigrants do contribute to rising housing demand, they are not the primary drivers of increasing housing costs. Instead, factors such as housing shortages, restrictive zoning laws, and shifts in housing preferences in the wake of the pandemic are the more dominant forces behind rising prices. Furthermore, immigrant workers are essential to the housing supply, making up a crucial segment of the construction workforce that can address shortages and improving housing stock.

Christopher J. Calton, a research fellow at a nonpartisan think tank called The Independent, condemned the administration in May for blaming immigrants for rising prices.

“The simple truth is that we would have a severe housing shortage even if President Trump were to deport every undocumented immigrant tomorrow,” Calton said, adding that, “the longer we scapegoat immigrants for America's self-imposed housing shortage, the longer it will take us to solve it.”

Beyond his bigoted remarks about immigrants, Vance's other claim in the interview — that inflation is the fault of the previous administration — is also flawed.

While inflation was high under the Biden administration, most economists attributed it at the time to the reopening of the economy following the COVID pandemic, as demand for products went up and disruption in supply chains affected prices. “Greedflation” — when corporations use the effects of inflation to justify increasing prices higher than is necessary in order to make higher profits — also played a role in costs going up.

Even so, year-over-year inflation shrank slightly from 3.0 percent in 2023 to 2.9 percent in 2024. So far in 2025, it appears that inflation is on track to rise by 3.0 percent again.

While not a significantly huge increase, the rate change suggests that Vance's arguments about an “inherited” inflation problem are false — if prices were getting better under Trump's watch, that number would be lessening, not growing. 

What's more, studies demonstrate that Trump's various tariffs have indeed contributed to a rise in retail prices for consumers, amounting to an effective tax rate of about 18 percent on American shoppers, the highest level since 1934. 

Trump repeatedly promised to lower prices on the campaign trail last year, vowing to do so “on day one” of taking office. However, just weeks after he won his second term, Trump admitted he might not be able to keep his pledge.

“I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard,” Trump said.

Presently, Trump is deflecting from concerns about affordability. In response to off-year elections earlier this month that saw huge wins for Democrats across the country, Trump insisted that voters were not casting their ballots based on concerns about affordability, describing the concept as a “con job” by Democrats. Instead, Trump said he and Republicans “are the ones that have done great on affordability.”

“Our groceries are way down. Everything is way down, and the press doesn't report it,” Trump during a White House event nearly two weeks ago.

But that claim is false: Grocery store prices, similar to inflation overall, have increased by 2.7 percent since Trump won the 2024 presidential election. 

Trump also disregarded rising prices in a lengthy Truth Social post over the weekend, writing that he and Republicans  “are winning BIG” on “the Economy” and “Affordability.”

Voters, however, do not appear to agree: A Quinnipiac University poll published in mid-October shows that only 38 percent of Americans give the president positive marks on his handling of the economy, while 57 percent said they disapproved of his job performance on the issue.

 A Global Customs Union Could Solve the Problem of Imbalances

 Michael Pettis

Debates over world trade often conflate two distinct issues. The first is how to expand the efficiencies that occur when international trade is broadly balanced and countries are able to benefit from trade by specializing in particular industries. As the British economist David Ricardo famously observed, when Portugal specialized in producing wine and the United Kingdom specialized in producing textiles, trade allowed them collectively to produce more than they otherwise would. The second issue is how to think about and allocate the costs of persistent trade surpluses—or when some countries export more than they import in order to resolve economic imbalances between domestic production and domestic demand.

Many economists are unable to distinguish between the two, mainly because mainstream models are largely based on assumptions that government intervention in trade is limited, and countries export primarily to maximize their imports. Their policy recommendations thus assume that countries export roughly as much, value-wise, as they import—even in cases where that clearly isn't true. Instead, some large economies use growing exports not to pay for growing imports but rather to compensate for weak domestic demand. To do so, they manipulate their trade and capital accounts to keep their manufacturing cheap—such as by suppressing their currencies. They then export their cheaper wares, forcing the wider world to absorb their subsidized manufacturing while insulating their economies from the consequences of weak domestic purchasing power.

Persistent trade imbalances are thus the result of a world in which—to use the framing of the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik—countries have made different tradeoffs between global integration and economic sovereignty. Those choosing more of the former have to absorb the imbalances of those choosing more of the latter. Consider, for example, a government that runs surpluses by pursuing policies that effectively subsidize manufacturing at the expense of households. It might do so by suppressing the rate at which banks lend to manufacturers, by depreciating its currency, or by subsidizing transportation infrastructure. Unless its trade partners resist with countervailing policies, they will have to absorb this surplus either through higher domestic investment, higher consumption, higher unemployment, or some combination of the three. That is true no matter how powerful those partners might otherwise be. The United States, for example, has the biggest economy in the world. But because its market has been so open, its economy has been partly restructured by China—which heavily subsidizes its domestic manufacturers.

This doesn't mean governments should close themselves off to international commerce; people benefit from trade. But to make sure that trade serves their national interests, the United States and its allies must create a system that reduces the ability of countries to offload the cost of their domestic policies. The best way they can do so is by establishing a new global customs union whose members agree to keep their trade relatively balanced and free, while putting up barriers against countries that refuse to balance exports with imports. Within such a union, a government could still choose to subsidize certain types of investment and manufacturing, but only if it can itself absorb the resulting costs. For trade to work, every state must maintain its economic sovereignty. Otherwise, countries will have too strong an incentive to export their economic problems through beggar-thy-neighbor policies.

Any country's internal imbalances must always be consistent with its external imbalances, which in turn must always be consistent with the external imbalances of its trade partners. The result in today's hyperglobalized world is a kind of transitive property: states that control their capital and trade accounts can export the costs of their domestic policies. Consider what happened, for example, when Germany chose to address domestic unemployment in the 1990s with the Hartz reforms of 2003–5. These reforms effectively restrained wage growth relative to productivity, reducing the share of German GDP held by German workers and sharply boosting business profits. The lower wage share limited domestic consumption while the higher business profits led to an expansion in manufacturing. The country's trade surpluses surged.

These effects did not end at Germany's borders. At the time, Berlin effectively managed the euro, thanks to its dominance at the European Central Bank, and used this power to limit monetary and interest-rate adjustments within the European Union. As a result, Germany's EU partners were forced to import nearly all of Germany's surpluses. As they ran the corresponding trade deficits, their economies had to adjust, sometimes with higher investment, including in real estate bubbles, and sometimes with higher unemployment or rising household or fiscal debt. But either way, the manufacturing share of GDP rose in Germany and fell elsewhere in the eurozone.

Germany's behavior helps explain why so much of Europe struggled to recover after the 2008 financial crisis. Analysts like to blame the troubles of Greece, Portugal, and Spain on bad domestic decisions, especially excess fiscal spending, but in truth, the hardships they experienced were not only the product of decisions made in Athens, Lisbon, or Madrid. They were also the consequence of policies designed by Berlin to expand German manufacturing. Those policies were transmitted through Berlin's trade and capital account to its European Union partners, causing them to lose manufacturing while being forced to make tradeoffs between higher unemployment and higher debt. Berlin, in other words, was able to use trade to accommodate its industrial policies in Germany, which in turn constrained and directed policy in much of the EU.



A similar story unfolded between China and the United States around the same time. Between 2002 and 2010, as Beijing implemented negative real interest rates to clean up a banking system burdened with bad loans, the household and consumption shares of China's GDP fell sharply—from an already low 48 percent of GDP at the beginning of the century to a surreal 34 percent by 2011. China's national savings and trade surplus soared, along with its manufacturing, which was energized by extraordinarily cheap capital.

But again, this was not the end of the story. The Chinese economy's surplus savings were mostly directed into the United States by the People's Bank of China. The bank was shocked by the Asian financial crisis of 1997, when a sudden run on the Thai baht set off a vicious currency crisis, rocking the region's banking systems and pushing many of their economies into serious trouble. China avoided the worst of it, but the People's Bank—eager to protect the Chinese economy from future such events—accumulated massive amounts of U.S. government bonds to shore up its reserves. By pouring money into these bonds and forcing up the value of the dollar relative to the yuan, China also forced the United States to run corresponding deficits. That led to changes in the latter country's internal economic imbalances. Manufacturing leaked abroad to China, and American factories closed down production lines and fired workers.

The United States was able to avoid a spike in unemployment, mainly by running larger fiscal deficits and having households borrow more. But as China's share of global manufacturing surged, the United States shifted domestic economic production away from manufacturing and into service sectors. The United States thus changed the structure of its economy, partially directing and reshaping U.S. employment and leverage, not because Americans chose those changes but because of policies made by decision-makers in Beijing aimed at stabilizing China's banks.

In a truly open world—one with no directed credit, no currency intervention, no restrictions on trade and capital flows, and minimal government intervention in output—one country's imbalances would not be so easily transmitted. Instead, they would tend to self-correct as market-determined exchange rates, capital flows, and interest rates adjusted in ways that reversed the internal imbalances. In this world, trade would be broadly balanced, with countries pursuing comparative advantages and exporting to pay for imports that maximized domestic welfare.

But in the real world, some major economies actively intervene in their trade and capital accounts, producing persistent surpluses caused by distortions in domestic demand and production, whereas other economies don't. Little wonder, then, that the present trading system is so unstable. If some countries are able to use an open global trading system to transfer economic headaches onto their trading partners, the latter will eventually turn against the existing regime.

To sustain a stable and fair global system, policymakers must recognize that shared trade entails shared constraints. All major economies must accept similar limits on their ability to manage credit, currencies, and external accounts. The world must, in other words, fashion a new trading regime that forces each member to resolve its external imbalances at home, as the economist John Maynard Keynes proposed at Bretton Woods in 1944.

Thus far, countries have shown little appetite for forging such a coalition. Instead, they are embracing the kind of “beggar-my-neighbor” policies that the economist Joan Robinson warned of in 1937, when she explained that the main purpose of trade surpluses was to externalize the unemployment that results from weak domestic demand. The United States, for example, is now working aggressively—although not very effectively, if the growing U.S. trade deficit is any indication—to reduce its trade deficit by imposing tariffs. Other states are responding with their own retaliatory measures.



There is a better way. When trade is used by countries to expand their relative share of production, it allows individual countries to benefit from policies that are collectively harmful. Still, balanced trade can be positive for global growth, provided that it rearranges global production to maximize production efficiency. Instead of trying to restrict trade through piecemeal measures, the United States should try to impose a system similar to what Keynes proposed at Bretton Woods. Washington and its allies should organize a new global customs union open to all countries that commit to balanced trade. States would be able to join the union by agreeing to keep their current accounts with the union within a narrow band. This band would allow normal cyclical variations while preventing the externalization of policy-driven imbalances.

The customs union would then balance trade with nonmembers by adopting variable trade barriers—either in the form of tariffs or taxes on capital flows—that prevent the imbalances of nonmembers from being imported into the customs union. This would not be a political sanction, but rather a rules-based measure among trade partners. To join the union, countries would have to agree to these restrictions.

The principle behind such a union is that the gains from trade are largest when trade flows are reciprocal and sustainable. That is because persistent, policy-engineered surpluses—designed, for example, to boost a country's manufacturing share by suppressing wage growth—do not maximize global output. They instead reflect income distribution choices and credit policies that reduce global demand while pushing the cost of that reduced demand onto trade partners in the form of higher unemployment or higher debt.

Debates over “free trade” cannot be separated from questions of sovereignty. To sustain a stable and fair global system, policymakers must recognize that integration entails shared constraints. Countries cannot insist on the freedom to engineer domestic imbalances while also insisting that other countries absorb them. Unless major economies accept equivalent limits on their ability to manage credit, currencies, and external accounts, the world will see recurring beggar-thy-neighbor tensions, protectionist backlashes, and a fragmented trading order. The arithmetic of global accounts guarantees it.

 American Force Won't Dislodge Maduro, but American Diplomacy Might

 Francisco Rodríguez

President Donald Trump, it seems, has it out for Venezuela. Over the summer, his administration began massing naval power in the Caribbean, largely near the country's coast, and striking ships soon after they exit its territorial waters. In October, he authorized the CIA to carry out operations within Venezuela's borders. And Trump has repeatedly railed against President Nicolás Maduro, accusing him of emptying Venezuelan prisons into the United States and saying that his days in office are numbered. This week, Washington moved an aircraft carrier group to the Caribbean, and Trump was briefed on possible military options, including land strikes. Publicly, the White House maintains its operations are simply designed to stop narcotics—not to facilitate regime change. But the scale of the military deployment (it is the largest in the Caribbean since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis) and the accompanying rhetoric suggest Washington's real objective is toppling the government.

If Trump does attack Venezuela, it is unlikely to end well. Short of an invasion—a move for which there is little domestic appetite and for which the current mobilization is inadequate—a show of force will probably not be enough to bring down Maduro's regime. As the political scientists Alexander Downes and Lindsey O'Rourke wrote in Foreign Affairs, airstrikes alone have never driven a leader from office. Even if U.S. efforts somehow succeeded here, Venezuela's military would almost certainly replace Maduro with an insider. And even if, against all odds, Venezuela's opposition seized sudden control of the country, there is no guarantee that its ascendance would lead to a durable, democratic transition.

Trump, of course, could decide to attack anyway. But the White House probably knows that a simple show of force won't topple Maduro, and for all of Trump's fiery rhetoric, he has historically opposed large-scale military interventions involving prolonged deployments and nation building.

Instead, throughout his two administrations, Trump has consistently approached thorny domestic and foreign policy issues via a strategy he laid out in his 1987 book, The Art of the Deal: escalate to negotiate. Shortly after North Korea tested nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States in 2018, Trump threatened it with “fire and fury like the world has never seen.” He then held three summits on denuclearization with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump threatened to pull the United States out of NATO if other members did not raise their own levels of military spending. Most did, and so Washington has stayed put. And in April, Trump raised tariffs on almost every country in the world, only to pause many of the levies in order to negotiate with states for lower trade barriers.

If Trump's plan is to force regime change in Venezuela, then he could be walking into an embarrassing and expensive failure. But if he sees the military buildup as a prelude to a diplomatic overture, he has a shot at notching perhaps the most significant foreign policy win of his administration. To succeed, however, Washington must understand that democratic transitions do not happen overnight. Instead, they tend to occur after extensive negotiations in which the dictatorship agrees to start sharing authority with its critics. Free and fair elections come at the end—not at the beginning—of these transitions, because institutional reforms and a period of coexistence with the outgoing regime are needed to make a peaceful transfer feasible.

The United States should thus use its leverage to get both sides of Venezuela's internal political conflict to the negotiating table. It should then force each to abandon its maximalist goal—obliterating the other—and instead, accept sharing power. A deal that does this may not feel as satisfying to some as would a military strike. Unlike a CIA operation to remove Maduro, it does not promise immediate results. But it is far more likely to be effective at advancing U.S. interests, improving the lives of Venezuelans, and setting the stage for the country's democratization.

When it comes to attempts at regime change, Venezuela is a graveyard of ideas. During Trump's first administration, the United States imposed punitive economic sanctions on the country's oil and mining sectors, believing that depriving the government of crucial resources would lead to its implosion. It didn't: Maduro stayed in power, even as the sanctions helped provoke the largest peacetime economic contraction and migration exodus in modern history. The Biden administration took a different approach, offering partial sanctions relief in exchange for commitments to hold free elections. But this, too, floundered. During the country's 2024 contest, more than half of Venezuelans turned out to vote, and according to the opposition's methodical collection of official tally sheets, the former diplomat Edmundo González overwhelmingly prevailed. But electoral authorities declared Maduro the winner anyway, and his government forcefully put down the resulting protests.

But there is another approach to handling Maduro, one that has not been properly attempted: brokering a coexistence agreement between the president and his opponents. Rather than forcing Maduro to give up power immediately—a demand that has repeatedly proved unrealistic—the goal with such a deal would be to incentivize his government to gradually yet meaningfully democratize.

This idea shares some elements with the first Trump administration's Democratic Transition Framework for Venezuela. That plan, outlined in 2020, would have created a Council of State featuring both government and opposition representatives to oversee a transition to free and fair elections. But the framework treated the power-sharing council as a short-term bridge to national elections, which would come within, at most, a year. To work, coexistence agreements almost always need to run for a longer time, as this one should.



Done right, a coexistence deal would have good odds of democratizing Venezuela, at least relative to the alternatives. Decades of political science research show that these kinds of so-called pacted transitions offer one of the most stable avenues for ending authoritarian rule. Latin America alone has multiple states—Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay—in which reforms initiated by an authoritarian government created a level political playing field that has lasted across multiple governments. It is, by contrast, rare to find cases in which an external intervention has led to a durable process of democratization, in the absence of a prolonged military occupation.

And Venezuela, in particular, needs a pacted transition. After years of dictatorship, the country is deeply divided. Although most of the country opposes Maduro, nearly one-third of the population still identifies with him. Many more people—over half the country—have a positive view of Hugo Chávez, the populist former president who mentored Maduro and, before dying in 2013, named Maduro as his successor. To successfully undertake major reforms, Venezuela's next leader will thus need support from at least some Chavistas.

Without a power-sharing deal, however, Venezuela's opposition is unlikely to construct a big tent. Instead, it might use the presidency to seek revenge. It has, after all, failed to condemn the forced deportations and killings of Venezuelans in the Caribbean. It has advocated for sanctions that have severely damaged the country's economy. It has, in other words, subordinated human rights concerns to political objectives—the hallmark of an authoritarian movement. Coupled with Venezuela's winner-take-all political institutions, it is not hard to imagine an anti-Chavista president becoming the mirror image of Maduro and using the institutions of the state to viciously persecute opponents.

If anti-Chavista leaders do prioritize vengeance, Venezuela will not only face continued autocracy and economic malaise but also risk civil war. The country's military is packed with Chavistas, and should Venezuela's next leader systematically purge them, they might start an armed insurgency—drawing on support from Colombian guerrillas and organized criminal networks that have a strong presence in Venezuela. The result could be a prolonged internal conflict, reminiscent of the one that has plagued Colombia for over 50 years.

To work, a Venezuelan grand bargain will need to ensure that both dueling factions are represented in the country's many political and legal institutions. A stable democracy requires not just elections but also arrangements that limit executive power and make political competition safe and meaningful. Transitioning away from autocracy is difficult precisely because autocratic governments lack such bodies and rules; instead, they tend to concentrate authority, opening the temptation for opposition movements to similarly abuse power once they reach office. Venezuela's constitution, for example, allows the president to convene elections for a constitutional convention that can dissolve the other branches of government at any time. This prerogative would almost certainly be used by the opposition upon taking charge to drive Chavistas from all state institutions.

But Trump might be able to prevent a vicious cycle—while still easing out Maduro—by compelling Venezuela's two camps to forge a joint agreement. The country's opposition is highly dependent on Washington and thus ill positioned to refuse its demands. Meanwhile, by confronting the Maduro regime with an existential threat unlike any it has faced, Trump has gained new leverage over Caracas. This puts him in a position to make both sides an offer they can't refuse: a framework for political coexistence with institutional guarantees, backed by the United States and other major international actors (who would also promise to help facilitate economic recovery).

In practice, this would mean representatives from the regime would need to agree to carve out quotas for the opposition in key branches of government. Opposition figures should, for example, receive guaranteed representation in the supreme court, the electoral council, and the country's key oversight institutions. A credible arrangement would appoint opposition representatives to eight of the 20 seats in the supreme court, with another four justices chosen from figures acceptable to both sides; similar ratios should be used for appointments to the electoral council. Opposition-nominated justices should hold a majority of votes in some key supreme court chambers, such as the Criminal Cassation Chamber, which reviews prosecutions for human rights abuses and can overturn politically motivated convictions. Similarly, negotiators must agree to the appointment of a new prosecutor general, comptroller general, and ombudsperson. At least one of these positions should be held by an opposition nominee, and another by a figure acceptable to both sides. An impartial or opposition-aligned comptroller general (who oversees the use of public funds and investigates corruption in public administration), for example, could reassess the bans on political participation that have played a key role in reducing the competitiveness of Venezuelan elections.



Some of these reforms will require that Venezuela amend its constitution. Right now, it is the text of an electoral autocracy, not a democracy. A revised document must reduce the power of the executive branch and enshrine protections that ensure the losers of future elections will not be persecuted. It must also abolish the power of constitutional conventions to dissolve nonexecutive branches of government, create a bicameral legislature with binding supermajority requirements for key laws, and establish explicit provisions blocking whatever side wins the next election from manipulating the country's transitional judiciary and oversight bodies. Most important, the new constitution should emerge from an inclusive national discussion and be approved by Venezuelan voters in a referendum. That referendum would double as an opportunity for the new electoral authority to establish its credibility before Venezuelans—and before the world.

Reforming Venezuela's institutions will, naturally, be a protracted process. But there are steps the country could take immediately, including ending political persecution and other human rights abuses. The government should begin with the release of all political prisoners and the approval of a new law to limit arbitrary detention. It could create an impartial oversight body, assisted by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and empower it to supervise the conditions of any remaining or new detainees in real time and to order investigations for human rights abuses. This body would also have the authority to ensure that the country's National Telecommunications Office stops using its regulatory authority to censor speech.

These institutional and legal reforms would go a long way in facilitating Venezuela's democratic transition. But they are not enough to secure the country's future. As part of any agreement, the government and the opposition must work together to revive Venezuela's moribund economy. They can start by crafting an internationally backed economic reconstruction program aimed at reinserting the country into global oil and financial markets. To do so, the government and opposition could jointly appoint nonpartisan experts to head the country's central bank and oil company. The United States would lift all economic sanctions on the country and, in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund and private creditors, coordinate to give Venezuela the financial and technical assistance it needs to embark on reforms aimed at restoring its economic competitiveness and rebuilding its social and physical infrastructure.

Eventually, the country would hold elections at different levels of government. But the timetable for doing so must be gradual. Venezuela will be unable to carry out a free and fair contest until its new institutional framework is consolidated and the economy is clearly rebounding—a process that is likely to take three to five years. Even then, elections must proceed under a predetermined schedule: first local, then regional, then parliamentary, and finally presidential. The transitory judiciary, electoral, and oversight bodies that embody the power-sharing arrangements will have to remain in place, with the same split membership, through at least the first post-transition presidential term.

For American officials eager to get rid of Maduro, a pacted transition might sound far too slow and far too intricate. But in Venezuela, there are no shortcuts to a better future, and this proposal's deliberate pace is why it holds more promise than any alternative promising immediate solutions. By limiting the government's ability to rig elections while constraining the opposition's capacity to abuse executive authority, it generates the incentives for both sides needed to make a peaceful transfer of power viable. More important, it would cause immediate improvements in the living conditions of Venezuelans—freeing hundreds of political prisoners and leading to a rapid economic recovery that would stem outward migration. It would also contribute to addressing Washington's political priorities by allowing the United States and Venezuela to work together to reduce transnational crime and migration pressures.

This agreement will be staunchly opposed by extremists on both ends of Venezuela's political spectrum. But that is not unusual: democratic transitions are, more than anything, a process of finding common ground between moderates on different sides of polarized polities. Other countries have managed to bridge these divides, and Venezuela can, too. The United States and its partners can help by supporting negotiations aimed at helping the country establish a broad political consensus on a path forward.

The potential upside to the current U.S. military buildup off the coast of Venezuela may lie precisely in the uncertainty it has generated. In classic Art of the Deal style, Trump has single-handedly raised the stakes of Venezuela's political conflict. The risks are now high not just for the Maduro government, which faces the real prospect of a massive military attack, but also for the opposition, whose near-total dependence on U.S. support has been laid bare. Trump's threat of fire and fury could presage violence. But it could just as easily create an opening for a negotiated transition—one that breaks a catastrophic stalemate and allows Venezuelans to reclaim their future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Exclusive: Elizabeth Warren calls on Harvard to sever ties with Larry Summers after new Jeffrey Epstein emails","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/elizabeth-warren-larry-summers-harvard-epstein","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:05:50 GMT","


            Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Harvard University should sever ties with Larry Summers, the school's former president and one of its most prominent faculty members — putting new pressure on the elite university to hold Summers accountable for his close friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            New details of Summers' relationship with Epstein emerged last week when a House committee released emails showing years of personal correspondence between the two men, including Summers making sexist comments and seeking Epstein's romantic advice.
    


            Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor and now the Democratic senior senator from Massachusetts, said in response to a CNN inquiry that she believes Summers “cannot be trusted” with students given his past relationship with Epstein.
    


            “For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,” Warren told CNN. “If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein's sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation's politicians, policymakers, and institutions — or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.”
    


            CNN has reached out to Summers and Harvard for comment. Summers has previously said he regrets his past association with Epstein.
    


            Summers served as Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary and Barack Obama's director of the National Economic Council and has been one of the country's most influential economic voices for decades. Warren, an economic populist, has clashed with Summers over financial regulations in the past.
    


            But her new call on policymakers and institutions to shun Summers represents an even sharper critique of his character.
    


            A spokesperson for the Center for American Progress, the left-leaning think tank where Summers is a senior fellow, said in a statement to CNN: “Larry Summers is a non-resident, uncompensated fellow at CAP. We are reviewing last week's disclosures to determine appropriate next steps.”
    


            Summers resigned as Harvard's president in 2006 under pressure amid multiple controversies, including his suggestion that men may perform better in the sciences because of genetic differences from women. He currently serves as the Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard.
    


            The House Oversight Committee released tens of thousands of pages of documents on Wednesday that it received from the Epstein estate. Included in the recent trove were numerous exchanges between Summers and Epstein between at least 2013 and 2019. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida of one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of solicitation of prostitution with a minor.
    


            The messages show the two men frequently bantered about current events, political headlines and high-profile figures in elite orbits — everything from Iran's nuclear policy to Donald Trump's first-term decisions in the White House.
    


            At other times, the two men appeared to discuss Summers' romantic endeavors, with Epstein offering advice.
    


            In November 2018, for example, Summers seemed to forward an email from a woman to solicit Epstein's advice on when to write back.
    


            “Think no response for a while probably appropriate,” Summers wrote. (He happened to ask in the same email whether Epstein believed Trump was “getting crazier” or was “steady crazy.”)
    


            Epstein wrote back in part: “she's already beginning to sound needy :) nice.”
    


            In March 2019, the two men exchanged multiple emails over the course of one morning, appearing to debate whether Summers should send a note to a woman of romantic interest. Summers' continued contact with Epstein during this period was particularly noteworthy because the Miami Herald published just months prior an exhaustive investigative series detailing Epstein's abuse of underage girls, and exposed what the paper called “the deal of a lifetime” that he negotiated in 2007 and 2008 to avoid federal charges.
    


            Sending a note would be “BAD FORM,” Epstein argued to Summers.
    


            “Why bad form. Supposed to be face to face?” Summers wrote back.
    


            “you care very much for this person. You might want to demonstrate that. a note does the very opposite,” Epstein wrote back, before appearing to compare the situation to Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey.
    


            And in one October 2017 email to Epstein, Summers mused: “I observed that half the IQ In world was possessed by women without mentioning they are more than 51 percent of population.”
    


            Summers' wife, Elisa New, is a professor emerita of American literature at Harvard. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Summers had asked Epstein to donate money to his wife's nonprofit. The school's student paper, The Harvard Crimson, reported on the outrage among some professors about the emails between Summers and Epstein. Rachel McCleary, a lecturer in the economics department, where Summers still teaches, told The Crimson his relationship with Epstein was not “just one lapse” but rather a “character flaw.”
    


            Trump said after the release of the latest batch of Epstein files, which included numerous comments and discussions about the president, that he is asking his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to investigate Epstein's ties to high-profile figures and institutions. Among those Trump singled out included Summers, Clinton and JPMorgan Chase.

            The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will review a controversial immigration policy adopted during the first Trump administration of turning away potential asylum seekers before they step foot on American soil, setting up the first major immigration policy case of the term.
    


            Federal law requires the government to process asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry. But in 2018, President Donald Trump's first administration began a policy known as “metering,” in which border agents simply turned back potential asylum seekers to Mexico before they entered the US.
    


            An immigrant rights group, Al Otro Lado, and several asylum seekers filed a lawsuit in California challenging the policy. An appeals court based in San Francisco sided with the migrants, and the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court in July.
    


            The practical impact of the litigation, at least for now, is limited at best. The Biden administration rescinded “metering” and instead began requiring most people seeking asylum to make an appointment before arriving at a port of entry. Because of that, Al Otro Lado argued that the case “has almost no present implications, and likely no future implications either.”
    


            But the Trump administration balked at that reasoning, telling the Supreme Court that “this administration and future administrations should retain the option of reviving that practice when border conditions justify doing so.”
    


            In that sense, the fact that the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case was already a win for Trump.
    


            A divided 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal law requires border agencies to inspect asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry, even if they did not enter the country. In its appeal to the high court, the Trump administration argued that cannot be right.
    


            “In ordinary English, a person ‘arrives in' a country only when he comes within its borders,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court. “An alien thus does not ‘arrive in' the United States while he is still in Mexico.”
    


            But the groups supporting Al Otro Lado said that reading would make a mockery of the asylum process, empowering officials to render “inspection and asylum processing requirements wholly inoperable at ports of entry – the designated places where noncitizens may lawfully come into the United States – by simply blocking asylum seekers from stepping on U.S. soil.”
    


            The court will hear arguments in the case next year and hand down a decision by the end of June.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Exclusive: Dominion Voting's new owner pledges impartiality, says, ‘I'm not on anybody's side'","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/politics/dominion-voting-new-owner","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT","


            The new owner of Dominion Voting Systems affirmed in his first interview since buying the company that President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election and pledged that his company's machines, used by nearly a third of US voters, won't be misused to help either political party.
    


            Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican election official from St. Louis who already runs a separate election tech company, bought Dominion last month and rebranded it Liberty Vote.
    


            The surprise move, and a public announcement that seemingly embraced parts of Trump's push to transform voting procedures, spooked election officials around the US, raising concerns about the future of a company that unexpectedly found itself at the center of Trump's attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss.
    


            After the 2020 election, Trump and his allies publicly claimed, repeatedly and falsely, that Dominion software flipped millions of his votes to Joe Biden. Some Trump allies also tried to breach Dominion machines, in hopes of proving Trump's fraud allegations. Dominion filed defamation lawsuits against many of the Trump lawyers and advisers who pushed these lies, and against the right-wing TV networks that gave them airtime. (Its case against Fox News famously settled for a historic $787 million in 2023.)
    


            Since buying Dominion last month, Leiendecker has embarked on a goodwill tour of sorts, meeting with about 80% of Dominion customers, spanning about half the country, and privately reassuring election administrators with a flurry of in-person visits and video conferences.
    


            “I'm an election person. I'm not on anybody's side or anybody's team. I'm on the American people's side. I'm on democracy's side,” Leiendecker told CNN in an exclusive and wide-ranging interview. “I want to make sure everybody knows I'm not siding with the left or the right. That's important to me. That's important to the process.”
    


            Despite his past work in Missouri GOP politics, Leiendecker said he isn't currently registered with any party, and “I am absolutely not an election denier.”
    


            Democratic and Republican election officials, and nonpartisan experts who advise them, covering dozens of counties, told CNN that Leiendecker has largely allayed their concerns and confusion stemming from the abrupt rebrand. After many states with Dominion machines held successful elections this month, some of their worst fears have eased, largely thanks to what Leiendecker has said in private meetings.
    


            One major source of comfort was Leiendecker's promise to keep existing Dominion employees on the job, multiple election officials said. This could be problematic among hardcore election deniers who have called for purges.
    


            “Their message was, ‘It's the same team, same group, same contacts,'” said Zach Manifold, the nonpartisan elections supervisor for Gwinnett County, in the Atlanta suburbs. “That's what I heard from Scott, too. One of the things he said to me was that the staff that was at Dominion were really great.”
    


            Michigan officials were similarly told last month by the vendor that services their Dominion equipment that they'll be using “the same proven product,” and to expect “no changes,” according to an email obtained by CNN.
    


            Trouble may still lie ahead.
    


            Trump has a long history of leaning on perceived allies in the election space to do his bidding. Leiendecker could face pressure from Trump or other election deniers in the administration to somehow use Dominion's assets to support their attempts to change election procedures.
    


            Some on the right have already criticized Leiendecker for not doing enough to help Trump as Dominion's new owner. Cleta Mitchell, who runs a national network of GOP election activists, said in an X post, “It is all a ruse. All of it,” complaining that the new owner hasn't returned the $67 million settlement it received from Newsmax or invited GOP activists to audit its machines.
    


            And there is also now growing distrust on the left. Last week, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat, claimed without evidence that Leiendecker bought Dominion to help Trump “cheat, potentially, with the voting machines” in the 2026 midterms, and urged states to stop using Dominion.
    


            The announcement of Leiendecker's purchase of Dominion landed on October 9 with a press release peppered with MAGA-friendly phrases.
    


            It touted usage of “hand-marked paper ballots” (a Trump obsession). It encouraged “third-party auditing” (made infamous from the GOP-backed Arizona snafu). And it highlighted its “100% American” ownership (even though Dominion wasn't foreign-run).
    


            It also promised “compliance with President Trump's executive order” on elections. That order, which had already been partially blocked by a judge, featured Trump's wish list to drastically change US election rules, like ending most mail-in voting and requiring proof of citizenship before registering.
    


            A lot of that language set elections officials on edge.
    


            “The owner's comment about making sure people use paper ballots did give me pause,” said Barb Byrum, the Democratic election clerk for Lansing, Michigan, who says she still hasn't been contacted by Leiendecker or his new team. “That is a typical election conspiracy theorist talking point. As someone who works in the election space, he should know that as well.”
    


            Byrum, who is running for the Democratic nomination in Michigan's secretary of state race next year, said liberal activists are regularly asking her at campaign events to address their suspicions about the Dominion sale.
    


            David Becker, an elections expert who advises officials from both parties, said the rebrand “was incredibly clumsy, and unnecessarily raised questions about the partisanship of the new owners.” But the sale “doesn't change anything” in terms of accurately casting votes and reporting honest results.
    


            “Folks on the left, who worry that MAGA now owns our elections, should not be worried,” Becker said. “And folks on the right, who think this fixes everything because Dominion was changing outcomes of elections, they're wrong too.”
    


            A person briefed on the matter told CNN that after the 2024 election, there was an “aura of uncertainty” at Dominion about the future of the business. Years of lawsuits and disinformation took a toll on its leaders, paving the way for a potential sale.
    


            Dominion's founder and CEO, John Poulos, already personally knew Leiendecker from their work in the relatively small election equipment industry, the person said. As negotiations over a sale began and intensified earlier this year, “the circle around it was kept really small,” the person said.
    


            “I don't want to sound corny, but I felt like it was my calling, in a sense,” Leiendecker told CNN of his decision to buy Dominion. “Somebody needed to do this. And I raised my hand to try to hopefully steer things in a direction where all voters can feel proud about what we do here in America.”
    


            “I don't know if it's going to be possible, but I'm going to try,” he added.
    


            Another person briefed on the matter said when the deal closed, Leiendecker expected to have more time to craft the public announcement. The person said: “They only gave him a few days; that's why the rollout was so unartful.”
    


            To help with the rollout, Leiendecker worked with Logan Circle Group, a Trump-aligned public relations firm that vows to fight for “America First.”
    


            It's unclear whether the rollout was intended to pander to Trump, to make the new Dominion more palatable to Republican customers in conservative jurisdictions, or something else. But election officials who have worked closely with Leiendecker are willing to vouch that he's not a partisan actor.
    


            “I've known this guy for 10 years, and I had no idea what his political party was,” said Manifold, the Atlanta-area elections supervisor.
    


            Election officials have borne the brunt of a yearslong assault against their work from Trump and his fellow 2020 election deniers. There have been record levels of disinformation, public vitriol and even death threats.
    


            The Dominion-related conspiracy theories were a big part of that. So, naturally, that topic came up in many of Leiendecker's recent sit-downs with election officials, multiple officials told CNN.
    


            “I asked him point blank in our first meeting, where he's at on the election, and if he believes 2020 was stolen,” said Matt Crane, a Republican who runs the Colorado County Clerks Association. “He said he doesn't think 2020 was stolen, and he's here to support the community of election administrators.”
    


            In Leiendecker's interview with CNN, he shied away from directly disavowing Trump's mantra that the election was “rigged.” But he made clear that he does not have concerns about the legitimacy of the 2020 election results.
    


            “I worked in Georgia. I witnessed all the recounts,” Leiendecker said. “They all came back the same. We saw a winner and we saw a loser in that election.” (Multiple Republican-run recounts confirmed Biden's victory in the state, which was certified by Georgia's Republican governor.)
    


            Leiendecker added: “I don't really like to go back and talk about what happened in 2020. I'm kind of moving forward. I don't want to relitigate the 2020 elections. We're in 2025 now. I'm focused on 2026 and 2028.”
    


            The election industry is small and — until 2020 — operated largely out of the public eye. Professionals from both political parties ran elections, reported results, conducted audits and worked with vendors, often without issue.
    


            Earlier in his career, Leiendecker was the top Republican election official in St. Louis County. He later founded KNOWiNK, a company that pioneered using iPads for electronic pollbooks, which are used to check in voters and verify their registration status when they arrive at their polling place.
    


            “Scott finds innovative solutions to issues,” said Ben Borgmeyer, the Democratic co-director of the St. Louis County election board. “We use KNOWiNK products every day. They're a partner we trust. Their Poll Pad is now ubiquitous across the face of US elections. Almost everyone uses it.”
    


            Borgmeyer said KNOWiNK helped him adapt during the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            Voters traditionally go to their own precinct and vote on preprinted ballots that contain their specific races. But during the pandemic, St. Louis and other cities opened larger “vote centers” where any county resident could cast their vote. Borgmeyer said they used new KNOWiNK technology to print ballots “on demand” for individual voters to use after they checked in.
    


            “It made so much sense, on so many levels,” Borgmeyer said. “They were trying to find solutions to make elections more efficient and accountable.”
    


            Pollbooks aren't involved in casting or counting ballots. After buying Dominion, Leiendecker is now a major player in that part of the process.
    


            For the 2024 presidential election, more than 63 million registered voters lived in jurisdictions that used Dominion machines or software, according to Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that tracks the equipment in every jurisdiction. That was about 28% of registered voters nationwide that year.
    


            Still, industry insiders who spoke to CNN emphasized that even if Leiendecker wanted to weaponize his new company to boost Trump, as some Democratic lawmakers and activists fear, there would be serious structural limitations.
    


            “I don't think a MAGA takeover is even possible,” a former senior Dominion official, who left years before it was sold, told CNN. “Vendors don't run elections. It's run by county clerks and secretaries of state. Vendors only supply the equipment. They have no influence over the election results.”
    


            There are also financial reasons why this wouldn't be a smart move. It would alienate customers in Democratic jurisdictions. And embracing Trump's call for hand-counting would undercut sales of their ballot tabulator machines.
    


            The former Dominion official said, “if they did all the election denier stuff, it would not be a viable business.” And when CNN asked Leiendecker whether his acquisition of Dominion was a MAGA takeover, he replied, “it's not.”

            Federal Reserve policymakers are split over whether they should continue cutting interest rates, ending a period of consensus that has defined Chair Jerome Powell's leadership of the central bank.
    


            The Fed's latest decision to lower interest rates by a quarter point in late October was opposed by two policymakers: one official who preferred to hold rates steady, and another who wanted a larger rate cut instead. A pair of opposing dissents had not been seen since 2019. Earlier this year, more than one Fed governor cast a dissenting vote for the first time in more than three decades.
    


            The growing divide among Fed officials has spilled out into public speeches in recent days, presenting a challenge for Powell as he works to retain consensus among colleagues.
    


            That division is a direct result of the uncertainty in the US economy and questions around the impacts of President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policy. The murky economic outlook has divided the rate-setting committee, which is tasked by Congress to keep the labor market intact and to tame inflation. Some Fed officials want to continue to focus on reining in higher prices, believing that tariffs could jack up inflation. Other policymakers say it's time to prioritize a weakening labor market.
    


            Economists say the potential implications of a divided Fed are a mixed bag, but nonetheless represent an extraordinary shift in the politics of the world's most powerful central bank.
    


            “If these intellectual disagreements aren't able to be reconciled, then that could affect the Fed's effectiveness and credibility,” said Derek Tang, an economist at LHMeyer, a monetary policy analytics firm.
    


            “In the next decade or so, the Fed could become like the Supreme Court, with people voting along party lines,” he said.
    


            As leader of America's central bank — and chair of its influential rate-setting committee — Powell now has his work cut out for him, but the outcome may be beyond his control.
    


            Over the past few decades, the Fed chair has increasingly played a key part in shepherding the central bank's policy decisions through careful consensus-building efforts.
    


With inflation and jobs in ‘tension,' Powell warns of the Fed's tightrope on interest rates



            The Fed chair's role of seeking unanimous agreement notably began under former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, according to Jon Hilsenrath, a long-time Fed watcher and senior adviser at brokerage firm StoneX Group. It involves regular meetings with members of the Fed's seven-person Board of Governors and the 12 regional Fed bank presidents.
    


            “Powell built on what Bernanke and (former Fed Chair Janet) Yellen did,” Hilsenrath said. “But this kind of breakdown in consensus is beyond Jay Powell or his leadership.”
    


            In a post-meeting news conference after the Fed announced its October decision, Powell said there were “strongly differing views” among officials on how to move forward. He had previously characterized the division as merely a “healthy debate.”
    


            Dissents from Fed officials are expected to persist through the final meetings of Powell's term as chair, which ends in May. That could make it difficult for Wall Street to know what to expect from the Fed: The chances of a December rate cut are currently a coin toss, according to futures.
    


            The Fed's policymaking these days has indeed gotten much more complex: During the pandemic-fueled recession in 2020, it was clear the Fed needed to lower borrowing costs aggressively — and keep rates at ultra-low levels — to shore up a battered economy. Similarly in 2022, it was obvious the Fed needed to hike rates aggressively to tamp down the fastest inflation in four decades.
    


            At the same time, a more divided Fed could bode well for its credibility.
    


            “The market might also come to a conclusion that they're not going to make extreme choices or lock themselves in to decisions that could lead the economy and the financial system in the wrong direction,” Hilsenrath said. “If there's more disagreement, then that kind of moderates the Fed's behavior.”
    


            Assessing the economy became even harder during the government shutdown, which was the longest in American history and suspended the release of weeks of economic data. At their October meeting, Fed officials were left without key readings on inflation and employment, metrics that are vital for policymakers when considering how to address their dual mandate.
    


            With the government now reopened, an upcoming deluge of data could easily tilt the scales in either direction.
    


            On the side of holding rates steady to tame inflation are three of the four regional presidents who vote on policy this year. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who dissented in October and preferred no rate cut, explained in a statement that his decision came about partly because people in his district have voiced “widespread concern over continued cost increases and inflation.”
    


            His colleague Alberto Musalem, president of the St. Louis Fed and also a voter this year, said this week: “We need to proceed and tread with caution, because I think there's limited room for further easing without monetary policy becoming overly accommodative,” at a Thursday event in Evansville, Indiana.
    


            On Wednesday, Boston Fed President Susan Collins said she would be “hesitant to ease policy further,” and that it would “likely be appropriate to keep policy rates at the current level for some time to balance the inflation and employment risks in this highly uncertain environment.”
    


The Fed's newest governor brings a Trump perspective on the economy. Is anyone buying it?



            Meanwhile, the opposing camp includes officials who believe the Fed should continue to lower rates, primarily because they don't see tariffs as likely having a persistent impact on inflation. They also believe the labor market is at risk of falling off a cliff if rates aren't lowered quickly enough.
    


            Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who has taken leave from his role as head of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers in order to fill a temporarily vacant seat on the central bank's Board of Governors, dissented on the Fed's decision last month to lower rates by a quarter point, instead backing a larger, half-point cut. In his latest remarks, he argued that borrowing costs are exerting more pressure on the economy than most think and that inflation is bound to slow “substantially” regardless.
    


            Miran is joined by Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, also Trump appointees, who have called for rate cuts starting in July. They believe that with inflation close enough to the Fed's target rate of 2%, the primary concern should be the softening labor market.
    


            “If you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,” Miran told The New York Times in an interview that published on November 1. “I don't see a reason to run that risk if I'm not concerned about inflation on the upside.”

            Hot Stocks 





            The Trump administration is investing in publicly traded companies — and it's sending stocks soaring higher.
    


            Under President Donald Trump, the US government has taken equity stakes in companies including Intel (INTC), MP Materials (MP), Lithium Americas (LAC) and Trilogy Metals (TMQ). Investing in public companies is an unusual move that has sparked debate on Wall Street and Capitol Hill about whether the government should be interfering in markets.
    


            Proponents say the equity stakes are a strategic move to support companies in industries that are critical to national security, such as rare earths mining and the production of semiconductor chips. Critics, meanwhile, say it's a heavy-handed use of government influence that is un-American and exposes taxpayers to unnecessary risk.
    


            So far, the government's portfolio is outperforming the S&P 500. Intel shares are up 77% this year. MP Materials shares have soared 276%. Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals shares are up 50% and 204%, respectively. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 14.5% this year.
    


            “Markets seem to be understanding these deals as the federal government signaling it will continue to support these companies,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.
    


            MP Materials is a rare-earths mining company. The company on July 10 announced the Department of Defense (now the Department of War) would purchase $400 million of the company's stock, giving it a 15% equity stake and making it the company's largest shareholder.
    


This company is America's best chance to loosen China's grip on rare earths



            Intel, the beleaguered chipmaker, announced on August 22 that the US government would invest $8.9 billion in the company, resulting in a 9.9% equity stake. On October 1, the Energy Department announced it would take a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas, a lithium production company.
    


            Trilogy Metals, a mining company that is developing an enormous mining project in Alaska, announced on October 6 that the US government would invest in the company. The Department of War took a 10% equity stake in Trilogy Metals.
    


            The Commerce Department announced on November 3 that it would take a $50 million stake in Vulcan Elements, a private rare earths start-up. The government also has a “golden share” in US Steel as part of a national security agreement with Nippon Steel, which acquired the company in June.
    


            The Trump administration's actions are meant to address trade tensions with China, including bolstering supply chains of critical materials like chips and rare-earth minerals.
    


            Rare earths in particular have become a sticking point in the US-China trade war. The minerals are used in everyday items like mobile phones as well as highly sensitive industries like defense, aerospace and the military.
    


What are rare earth minerals, and why are they central to Trump's trade deal with China?



            China accounts for roughly 70% of global rare-earth elements mining output, 90% of rare earths refining output and over 90% of rare-earth magnet production, according to ING, a Dutch bank.
    


            ‘Self-sufficiency, allied resilience and national industrial champions are no longer optional,” James Litinsky, chief executive at MP Materials, said on the company's earnings call on November 6. “They are the front lines of security.”
    


            White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that “the Trump administration is committed to using every tool at our disposal to safeguard America's national and economic security.”
    


            There is precedent for the government to take stakes in companies to bail them out during a crisis. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the government took stakes in companies including General Motors, Chrysler and AIG, then turned a small total profit when it exited those stakes by 2015.
    


            But the government taking stock in companies outside of emergency situations is rare. Experts say it falls within a legal gray area.
    


            “It is a real break from past attitudes toward government ownership, particularly for Republicans,” Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, said in an email.
    


            Skeptics say this kind of government intervention goes against free market values — and raises the risks of big losses for taxpayers. It's also uncertain that an equity stake can produce stronger supply chains.
    


Trump is trying to break China's monopoly on rare earths, but can't cut deals fast enough to catch up



            “There is the risk of failure. Not all investments work out,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. “You're going to find people who are questioning, ‘Why are we doing this? We don't need to risk our tax dollars.'”
    


            Scott Ladner, CIO at Horizon Investments, said he was skeptical about the decision to take stakes in companies. The government historically has been poor at picking winners, he said, and it could divert money away from other, more compelling companies that are not in the government's purview.
    


            “I just don't like the precedent that it sets going forward,” Ladner said. “These individual ones might end up working fine, but the precedent and the power that it gives to the government 10, 15, 20 years from now — I don't love that precedent.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A drone struck a Turkish-flagged tanker and set it ablaze on Monday in southern Ukraine's Odesa region, officials said, a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a deal to import U.S. liquefied natural gas through the area.

The MT Orinda was hit during the offloading of liquefied petroleum gas at Izmail port, Turkey's Directorate for Maritime Affairs said. All 16 crew on board evacuated and no one was hurt, it said.

Russia has used drones, missiles and artillery to repeatedly batter the Odesa region, especially its Black Sea ports, since its full-scale invasion of its neighbor nearly four years ago. There was no immediate Russia comment Monday.

Ukrainian officials didn't comment specifically on the tanker, although regional military administration head Oleh Kiper said Russian drones attacked the Odesa region overnight and damaged energy and port infrastructure in several cities.

The attack sparked multiple fires and damaged an unspecified number of civilian vessels, Kiper said, adding that one person was injured.

Izmail lies on a Black Sea estuary and is one of a string of ports that are vital for Ukrainian imports and exports. With Russia also targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Zelenskyy is trying to ensure gas and other energy imports that can help see his country through the approaching winter.

Zelenskyy on Sunday was on an official visit to Greece. The U.S. liquefied natural gas will flow to Odesa via pipelines from the northern Greek port of Alexandroupolis starting in January.




Authorities in Romania, meanwhile, ordered the evacuation of people and animals from two villages close to Izmail on the Romanian side of the border, saying the nature of the tanker's cargo required such precautions.

Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian missiles killed three people and injured 11 others in Balakliya in the northeastern Kharkiv region in an overnight attack. Four girls aged 12, 14, 15 and 17 were among those injured, authorities said.

Russian drones and artillery also killed two people and injured two others in a daylight attack on Nikopol in the central Dnipropetrovsk region on Monday. The attack hit high-rise apartment blocks, stores and a hair salon, said the regional head of the military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko.

The United Nations says Russian strikes have killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians during the war.

Russia fired two Iskander-M ballistic missiles and 128 strike and decoy drones across the country during the night, Ukraine's air force said.

Russian air defenses shot down 36 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia's Defense Ministry said, as Ukraine tries to hit back at Russia's power grid.

A Ukrainian drone attack damaged an electricity substation in Russia's Ulyanovsk region, Gov. Aleksey Russkikh wrote on social media, adding that no casualties were reported and that local power supplies were working normally.

A report by an Israeli human rights group says at least 98 Palestinians have died in Israeli detention facilities since the war in Gaza began. Physicians for Human Rights-Israel says systematic violence and denial of medical care contributed to the majority of the deaths it looked into. (AP Video)

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The number of Palestinians dying in Israeli custody surged to nearly 100 people since the start of the war in Gaza, according to a report published Monday by a human rights group that says systematic violence and denial of medical care at prisons and detention centers contributed to many of the deaths it examined.

The picture that emerges from the report by Physicians for Human Rights-Israel is consistent with findings by The Associated Press, which interviewed more than a dozen people about prison abuses, medical neglect and deaths, analyzed available data, and reviewed reports of autopsies. AP spoke with a former guard and a former nurse at one prison, an Israeli doctor who treated malnourished prisoners brought to his hospital, former detainees and their relatives, and lawyers representing them and rights groups.

The former guard at a military prison notorious for its harsh treatment of Palestinians told the AP detainees were routinely shackled with chains and kicked and hit with batons, and that the facility had been dubbed a “graveyard” because so many prisoners were dying there. He agreed to talk to AP to raise awareness of violence in Israeli prisons and spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal.

Of the 98 prisoner deaths PHRI documented since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war, 27 occurred in 2023, 50 in 2024 and 21 this year, the most recent on Nov. 2. PHRI says the actual death toll over this timeframe is “likely significantly higher,” noting that Israel has refused to provide information about hundreds of Palestinians detained during the war.







Fewer than 30 Palestinians died in Israeli custody in the 10 years preceding the war, PHRI says. But since the war, the prison population more than doubled to 11,000 as people were rounded up, mainly from Gaza and the West Bank. The number of prisoners dying grew at an even faster rate over that period, PHRI data shows.

PHRI documented deaths by interviewing former detainees and prison medical staff, examining reports prepared by doctors who observed autopsies at the behest of dead prisoners' families, and confirming dozens of fatalities through freedom of information requests.

“The alarming rate at which people are killed in Israeli custody reveals a system that has lost all moral and professional restraint,” said Naji Abbas, a director at PHRI.

Last year, the head of Israel's prison system, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, boasted that he had degraded prison conditions to the legal minimum. Under pressure from rights groups, conditions improved slightly.




Israel's Prison Service said it operates in accordance with the law. It declined to comment on the death count and directed any inquiries to Israel's army.

The army said it is aware some detainees have died, including people with preexisting illnesses or combat-related injuries. But army spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said the death count in the PHRI report is inflated, while declining to say what the army believes the real number to be.

It said allegations of abuse or inadequate conditions are assessed, and that those who violate the army's code of conduct are punished and sometimes subject to criminal investigations.

(Breaking The Silence via AP, File)



Although hesitant at first, the former guard at the Sde Teiman military prison in southern Israel said he eventually participated in beatings of prisoners.

One morning, early in Israel's war against Hamas, the guard arrived at work to see a motionless Palestinian lying on his side in the yard, yet no guards rushed to see what had happened to the man, who was dead.

“It was sort of business as usual with the dead guy,” said the guard, who didn't know the cause of death.

Prisoners' arms and legs were always in chains, and they were beaten if they moved or spoke, the guard said, adding that nearly all would urinate and defecate on themselves rather than ask to use the bathroom.




The former nurse at Sde Teiman said chains used to restrain many prisoners' arms and legs caused such severe wounds that some needed their limbs to be amputated. She spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. During the several weeks she worked there at the start of last year she didn't see anyone die, but she said the staff at times talked about prisoner deaths. She left the job because she didn't like the abusive treatment of the prisoners, she said.

The army said prolonged handcuffing is implemented only in exceptional cases when there are “significant security considerations.” Even then, detainees' medical condition is taken into account, it said. Only a few detainees from Gaza are currently being handled this way, it added.

Guards were told by their commanders – who also participated in the beatings -- that they needed to reduce the deaths, according to the Sde Teiman guard, who spent several months there.

Eventually cameras were installed, which helped mitigate the abuse, he said. Twenty-nine prisoners have died at Sde Teiman since the war began, according to PHRI.

Earlier this year, an Israeli soldier was convicted of abusing Palestinians in Sde Teiman and sentenced to seven months in prison, according to the army, which said this shows there is accountability.

But lawyers for prisoners say Israel rarely conducts serious investigations into alleged violence and that this fuels the problem.

In a sign of the public climate, the Israeli military's top lawyer was recently forced to resign after acknowledging she approved the leak of a surveillance video at the center of an investigation into allegations of severe sexual abuse against a Palestinian at Sde Teiman. The leak, meant to defend the decision by her office to prosecute guards for the alleged abuses, instead triggered fierce criticism from hard-line Israeli leaders who sympathized with the guards.

Several soldiers were indicted in that case, which is still pending before the military court.

It is difficult to pinpoint with certainty the cause of death for most prisoners. Sometimes, at the behest of prisoners' families, doctors were granted permission by Israel to attend autopsies and provided reports to the families on what they saw.

Eight reports seen by the AP showed a pattern of physical abuse and medical neglect.

In one, a 45-year-old man who died in Kishon detention center, Mohammad Husein Ali, showed multiple signs of physical assault, likely causing brain bleed, according to the report. The potential use of excessive restraints was also noted. His family said he was healthy before he was detained from his home in the West Bank. He died within a week of being imprisoned.




Husein Ali had previously served time in an Israeli prison after being convicted of association with militancy, according to his family. But they said he had no ties with militants when he was arrested last year.

After Husein Ali was taken, his 2-year-old daughter would stare out the window calling for her father, said his wife, Hadeel. “She'd say ‘baba, where's baba', but after time she stopped asking,” she said, wiping tears from her eyes.

Malnutrition was a contributing factor in at least one death, according to PHRI, leading to a 17-year-old boy dying from starvation.

In September, Israel's Supreme Court ordered that more and better food be served to Palestinian inmates. Rights groups say the situation has slightly improved.

The army said detainees receive three meals a day, approved by a dietitian. It said every detainee is examined by a doctor upon arrival and, for those who need it, monitored with regular checkups.



Sariy Khuorieh, an Israeli-Palestinian lawyer from Haifa, said he was detained at the start of the war after Israel accused him of inciting violence through his social media posts. While in Megiddo prison for 10 days, Khuorieh says he saw a man die after repeated beatings.

Khuorieh said the 33-year-old father of four from the West Bank was beaten almost daily. The man, and some of his relatives, had close ties to Hamas, according to a Palestinian security official and someone who knew the family, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for retaliation.

The night before the man died, he screamed in pain for hours while in solitary confinement, said Khuorieh, who choked back tears while recounting what happened. The man had repeatedly called for a doctor, but none came, Khourieh said.

A spokesperson for Israel's Prison Service wouldn't comment on the case.

A report written about the man's autopsy seen by AP said the cause of death was inconclusive but that there were signs of old and new bruising, including broken ribs. The report said it could be assumed that violence contributed to his death.

When the guards opened the man's cell they kicked and beat him before summoning a physician who tried to revive him and then pronounced him dead, said Khuorieh, who said he was able to see what was happening through the small window in his cell door.

Once the man was pronounced dead, Khuorieh said one of the officer's laughed and said: there's “at least one less” to care about.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tom Cruise, at 63 still the biggest movie star in a room full of them, finally got to hold his own Oscar on a Hollywood stage on Sunday night. 

“Making movies is not what I do, it's who I am,” said Cruise. He was composed as always, but at moments seemed near tears as he spoke, grasping the gold honorary statuette that celebrated his more than 40 years at the apex of the industry at the film academy's annual Governors Awards. 

“In that theater we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together,” he said after a two-minute ovation. 

Production designer Wynn Thomas and choreographer and actor Debbie Allen were also selected by the academy's board of governors to be honored for their storied careers, and an absent Dolly Parton was honored for a lifetime of philanthropy at the ceremony at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Los Angeles. 

A competitive Oscar has eluded Cruise, who's been nominated four times: as an actor for 1989's “Born on the Fourth of July,” 1996's “Jerry Maguire” and 1999's “Magnolia,” and as a producer for 2022's “Top Gun: Maverick.”

Before he took the stage, the audience saw a long montage of clips from those and his other films — loaded with death-defying stunts he often did himself — from 1981's “Taps” through this year's “Mission: Impossible -- The Final Reckoning.” 

It was fitting that the Governors Awards aren't televised. Tom Cruise doesn't do TV, and he's been among the biggest champions of the theatergoing experience over streaming. 




“I will always do everything I can to help this art form,” Cruise said. “To support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful. Hopefully without too many more broken bones.” 

Oscar-winning director Alejandro González Iñárritu presented Cruise the award. The two have spent several months shooting a film in London set for release in 2026. The collaboration suggests that Cruise, who has stuck to blockbuster franchise fare in recent years, might not be done trying to win an Academy Award the old-fashioned way. 

“This may be his first Oscar,” Iñárritu said, “but from what I have seen and experienced, this will not be the last.”

The list of stars who attended suggests that the campaign for the next competitive Oscars is low-key underway. The banquet tables were filled with potential nominees, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael B. Jordan, Sydney Sweeney, Dwayne Johnson, Ariana Grande and Jacob Elordi. 

Here's a look at Sunday night's other honorees: 

Allen, 75, has never been nominated for an Oscar. But the multi-hyphenate entertainer has played an integral role in the Oscars show, having choreographed seven ceremonies over the years, four of them nominated for Emmys. 

As an actor she appeared in “Ragtime” and both the film and television series “Fame.” She was also a producer of the film “Amistad,” whose director, Steven Spielberg, hugged her as she took the stage. 

A tearful Allen thanked the room for “this glorious golden moment in the sun.” 

Cynthia Erivo presented the award to Allen, whom she considers an “aunty,” and praised her for lifting up her fellow Black artists. 

“Debbie, you have not only shown us the great heights dedication to the arts can take us, you have fought to bring all of us along with you,” Erivo said. 

Allen thanked her sister, actor Phylicia Rashad, and her husband of 40 years, former NBA all-star and LA Laker Norm Nixon, both of whom sat at her table. 

Looking at her statuette, she said it feels like she and Oscar “got married. Sorry, Norman!” 

Thomas was honored for the decades of visual imagination he brought to films as one of the first Black production designers and art directors of Hollywood films. 

His movies have included director Ron Howard's best-picture winner “A Beautiful Mind” and director Tim Burton's sci-fi farce “Mars Attacks.” 

But he's best known for his decades of collaborations with director Spike Lee on films including “Do The Right Thing,” “Malcolm X” and “Da 5 Bloods.”

“My journey to storytelling began as a poor Black kid in one of the worst slums in Philadelphia,” Thomas said after accepting his statuette from Octavia Spencer. “The local gangs looked down on me and called me sissy. But that sissy grew up to work with some great filmmakers.” 

Parton was the recipient of the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her decades-long charitable work in literacy and education. 

The country music giant had to miss the show, her representatives said, because of a long-established scheduling conflict, and not health difficulties that prompted her to cancel several recent concerts. 

Parton has twice been nominated for best original song Oscars, including for “9 to 5,” the title song of her first film in an acting career that also included “Steel Magnolias.” 

Her “9 to 5” co-star Lily Tomlin presented the award, turning her struggles to read the teleprompter into comic improv. She fondly recalled the baby-doll pajamas Parton wore at the impromptu slumber parties they had with co-star Jane Fonda. 

Tomlin said the song “9 to 5” became “an anthem for our times” and was itself an example of Parton's philanthropy with its emphasis on worker struggles.

She said it's ironic that there is so much artifice in Parton's appearance, because “she is the most authentic person I have ever known.”

Cruise, in typically hyper-prepared fashion, didn't just shout out his fellow nominees from the stage, but gave each their own detailed tribute. He told Thomas the exact date and theater he first saw one of his films, Spike Lee's “She's Gotta Have It.” He praised Parton for showing that “compassion and creativity are not separate.” And for Allen he quoted from the work of her mother, poet and playwright Vivian Ayers Allen. 

Allen gave her own tribute to Cruise, recalling the early-career signature moment when he danced and lip-synced in his underwear in “Risky Business.” 

“Honey, we loved when you slid out in those tighty-whiteys,” she said.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Monday urged the board that oversees Alabama Public Television to delay any decision on severing ties with PBS until it has studied Alabamians' opinions on the matter and developed a plan for what comes next. 

The Republican governor sent a letter to the Alabama Educational Television Commission ahead of a Nov. 18 meeting in which commissioners were expected to discuss disaffiliation.

Some commission members had pushed the idea of dropping PBS due to federal budget cuts, President Donald Trump's dislike of public broadcasting and accusations of bias against NPR and PBS news programs from him and other conservatives. A decision to separate from PBS would mean Alabama Public Television would no longer air PBS programs, including “Sesame Street,” “Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood,” “Antiques Roadshow” and “PBS NewsHour.” 

“While I'm sympathetic to the concerns that may be prompting this proposal, such a sweeping, immediate action, especially if taken unilaterally by the executive branch, should be undertaken only after a thorough planning process and only with a thorough understanding of public opinion,” Ivey wrote. 

Ivey asked the commission to conduct an extended survey of Alabama voters “to ensure their voices are heard.” She said the commission should also develop a separation plan that “should be available for public review for a considerable length of time before any vote is taken.”

The idea of dropping PBS arose at the October commission meeting. Alabama Public Television Executive Director Wayne Reid said some commissioners asked him to research the possibility and ramifications of ending the contract with PBS. 




Commissioners were divided at an Oct. 28 meeting, according to the Alabama Reflector and al.com.

“I just, I don't want to fund it, PBS has made themselves the enemy of what I stand with, and so I do not like them, and I don't follow the philosophy of feeding the beast,” commission member Les Barnett said during the meeting, according to the Alabama Reflector.

Alabama Public Television pays about $2.2 million yearly for PBS programming.

The governor said it is imperative that APT programming “align with Alabama values,” but said the decision should be made in “collaboration among stakeholders.”

The possibility of dropping PBS prompted a backlash from Alabama public television viewers and donors. Petitions and posts were shared across social media, urging people to “Save PBS for Alabama Children” and “Don't let Alabama send Elmo packing.”

President Donald Trump defended conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, saying the former Fox News host has “said good things about me over the years.” He said if Carlson wants to interview Nick Fuentes, whose followers see themselves as working to preserve America's white, Christian identity, then “people have to decide.” Trump did not criticize Carlson or Fuentes.




WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday brushed aside concerns about conservative commentator Tucker Carlson's recent interview with a far-right activist known for his antisemitic views, which has caused a schism within the Republican Party.

Trump defended Carlson, saying the former Fox News host has “said good things about me over the years.” He said if Carlson wants to interview Nick Fuentes, whose followers see themselves as working to preserve America's white, Christian identity, then “people have to decide.” Trump did not criticize Carlson or Fuentes. 

Fuentes appeared to appreciate Trump's sentiment, posting “Thank you Mr. President!” along with video of his interaction with reporters. 

Carlson had an amiable sit-down on his podcast last month with Fuentes that touched off a controversy among conservatives. It roiled the Heritage Foundation, where the president of the right-wing think tank defended Carlson for his interview, drawing outrage from staffers. Heritage President Kevin Roberts later denounced Fuentes' views.

Trump told reporters as he prepared to fly back to Washington from a weekend in Florida that when it comes to Carlson, “You can't tell him who to interview.”

“If he wants to interview Nick Fuentes, I don't know much about him, but if he wants to do it, get the word out,” Trump said. “People have to decide.”

Trump a few minutes later added, “Meeting people, talking to people for somebody like Tucker — that's what they do. You know, people are controversial.”




The president then said: “I'm not controversial, so I like it that way.”

It's not the first time Trump has been asked about Fuentes. Three years ago, he hosted Fuentes at a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort, along with the rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.

Trump at the time said he had not previously met Fuentes and “knew nothing about” him.

Fuentes' visit to Trump's estate was condemned by numerous Republicans, including former Vice President Mike Pence, who said it was wrong for Trump “to give a white nationalist, an antisemite and Holocaust denier, a seat at the table.”

Trump said Sunday that he didn't know Fuentes at the time and that he didn't know he was coming with Ye.

Trump's defense of Carlson's interview comes as he has used his second-term administration to crack down on colleges and universities over what his administration claims is a tolerance of antisemitic views during protests over the Israel-Hamas war.

Carlson has been critical of U.S. support for Israel in that war and has come under fire for his own far-right views, including the white-supremacist theory that says whites are being “replaced” by people of color.

It's no magic trick: The third installment in the thieving magician “Now You See Me” series beat the high-profile action pic “The Running Man” at the North American box office this weekend. Lionsgate's “Now You See Me: Now You Don't” pulled in $21.3 million, while Paramount's “The Running Man” made $17 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.

“Now You See Me: Now You Don't,” which cost a reported $90 million to produce, comes almost 10 years after the second film. Including ticket sales from 64 international territories, its worldwide opening is estimated to be around $75.5 million. Going into the weekend, it was expected to be a closer race between the two newcomers. 

“Honestly, I didn't see us being number one for the weekend about 10 days ago,” Kevin Grayson, the president of worldwide distribution for Lionsgate's motion picture group, said Sunday. “But as we started to get closer and ticket sale numbers started to pop, we saw that there was going to be a horse race. Then we pulled away Saturday morning.”

Grayson said it's a testament not only to the franchise but the marketing and publicity strategies which, “really helped us get into a position where we now can play all the way through the holiday corridor.”

The first two movies in the “Now You See Me” series, released in 2013 and 2016, earned over $686 million worldwide. This installment, directed by Ruben Fleischer, sees the return of the original “Four Horsemen,” Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco, and introduces three younger magicians into the mix: Dominic Sessa, Ariana Greenblatt and Justice Smith. A fourth film is already in the works.




Reviews were mixed on Rotten Tomatoes, coming in at 59%. According to PostTrak polling, audiences were a bit more positive, with 63% saying they would definitely recommend.

Audience scores were slightly less for “The Running Man,” which had a 58% “definitely recommend.” Both earned a B+ CinemaScore, but more people chose the franchise. One key difference is that women made up more of the “Now You See Me” audience (54%). They only accounted for 37% of “The Running Man” ticket buyers. 

Edgar Wright directed and co-wrote “The Running Man,” the second adaptation of Stephen King's novel, first published in 1982. The first film starred Arnold Schwarzenegger and was released in 1987 to mixed reviews and a tepid box office, earning only $38 million against a $27 million budget. The new version stars Glen Powell, who has had a good track record starring in box office hits, from the romantic comedy “Anyone But You” to “Twisters.”

Paramount Pictures released “The Running Man” in 3,400 domestic locations and 58 international markets. Worldwide, it earned $28.2 million against a reported $110 million budget.

The weekend's other new opener, “Keeper,” the third feature from “Longlegs” filmmaker Oz Perkins, cratered with $2.5 million and a D+ CinemaScore. But as an acquisition title for Neon, it's also not a disaster.

Third place went to “Predator: Badlands” with $13 million in its second weekend, followed by “Regretting You” in fourth with $4 million. “Black Phone 2” rounded out the top five with $2.7 million, bringing its domestic total to $74.7 million after five weeks in theaters.

In anticipation of the big budget musical “Wicked: For Good,” which opens next week, Universal Pictures put “Wicked” back in 2,195 theaters, where it made $1.2 million — barely missing a spot in the top 10. 

The box office should pick up considerably when “Wicked 2” blows into theaters, followed by “Zootopia 2” before the Thanksgiving holiday. Comscore's Paul Dergarabedian said it could be one of the highest grossing five-day Thanksgiving frames of all time.

“After a terrible October, the lowest grossing in decades, it's just warming up,” Dergarabedian said. “It's never too late to get the momentum moving in the right direction.”

With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:

1. “Now You See Me: Now You Don't,” $21.3 million.

2. “The Running Man,” $17 million.

3. “Predator: Badlands,” $13 million.

4. “Regretting You,” $4 million.

5. “Black Phone 2,” $2.7 million.

6. “Nuremberg,” $2.6 million.

7. “Keeper,” $2.5 million.

8. “Sarah's Oil,” $2.3 million.

9. “Bugonia” and “Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc”,” (tie) $1.6 million.

FBI Director Kash Patel joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to discuss President Trump's deal with China's Xi Jinping to curb the flow of chemicals used in fentanyl production, the latest on the Arctic Frost probe and more.

Instead of waging a bloody battle that could ignite a clash between nuclear-armed states, China may be betting it can conquer Taiwan without firing a shot — by choking off the island's fuel and electricity until its government capitulates.

China's campaign wouldn't start with missiles but with paperwork and patrol boats — ""routine"" inspections, new customs rules and cyber intrusions designed to quietly strangle Taiwan's imports while giving Beijing plausible deniability, according to a new report by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). 

The report warns that a successful Chinese squeeze on Taiwan's fuel would ripple far beyond Asia. With the island producing most of the world's advanced semiconductors, any prolonged power outage could halt global electronics and defense manufacturing — hitting U.S. supply chains and markets almost immediately.

""Beijing's goal isn't to invade today, but to make Taiwan believe resistance is futile tomorrow. Its gray-zone campaign is a strategy of slow-motion strangulation — one that risks a sudden shock as Chinese ships and aircraft surge around the island,"" report author Craig Singleton said.

TAIWAN'S ENERGY DEPENDENCE IS 'ACHILLES HEEL' AMID IMMENSE THREAT BY CHINA

(Adrian Portugal/Reuters)

The findings stem from a tabletop exercise conducted this summer by FDD and Taiwan's Centre for Innovative Democracy and Sustainability at National Chengchi University. The simulation, called ""Energy Siege,"" tested how the Chinese Communist Party might escalate from bureaucratic interference to a full-blown energy quarantine.

Teams representing China, Taiwan, the United States, Japan and other allies wargamed a monthslong campaign in which Beijing throttled Taiwan's fuel imports through ""gray-zone"" tactics — administrative slowdowns, cyberattacks and disinformation — all while maintaining plausible deniability. The exercise found that a prolonged squeeze on Taiwan's liquefied natural gas (LNG) could cripple its electrical grid within weeks and trigger a global chip shock.

The report warns that cyber operations and propaganda would be central to Beijing's playbook. Chinese hackers have already doubled successful intrusions into Taiwan's energy grid over the past year, and the exercise envisioned them embedding malware in LNG terminals and power-plant control systems to disrupt shipments and distribution.

At the same time, Beijing would unleash a barrage of false narratives — rumors of blackouts, fuel hoarding and government incompetence — to erode public trust and fracture morale. ""For Beijing, disinformation is not a sideshow but its primary weapon,"" the report notes, describing a campaign designed to ""control the narrative and sap its adversaries' will.""

HIGH STAKES ON THE HIGH SEAS AS US, CHINA TEST LIMITS OF MILITARY POWER

Taiwan imports nearly all of its energy — half from natural gas and about 30% from coal — and holds only ""a few weeks' worth"" of reserves. ""Taiwan's three main LNG terminals and the Taichung coal offloading port are clustered along the island's west coast, within range of the CCP's missiles as shipments are funneled through narrow Taiwan Strait lanes,"" the report adds.

That dependency makes Taiwan one of the world's most energy-insecure economies. A blockade or ""energy quarantine"" could cut the island's power generation in half within weeks — forcing leaders to decide whether to keep the lights on for hospitals or for chipmakers like TSMC and UMC, Singleton and co-author Mark Montgomery write.

""Coercion, not combat, is Beijing's preferred weapon,"" Singleton said, adding that such a blockade would have ""ripple effects that would reshape global markets and stability alike.""

The report also calls for the United States to expand its own LNG export capacity — particularly through new projects in Alaska — to ensure it can supply Taiwan directly and make U.S. energy a core element of the island's resilience.

Taiwan produces around 60% of global semiconductor chips and 90% of the world's most advanced chips, though TSMC is building a facility in Arizona to help offset that imbalance. ""The choice to slowly shutter industrial capacity would eventually make Taiwan's conundrum a global catastrophe when a plurality of the world's supply of legacy chips and a supermajority of its advanced chips cease flowing,"" the report says.

The authors argue that Taiwan should build up its LNG reserves through greater U.S. supply and for the U.S. Navy to be ready to escort vessels delivering it. ""Beijing believes pressure plus patience equals political collapse,"" Montgomery said. ""What unnerves China isn't Taiwan's defiance, but its people's ability to withstand coercion.""

Beijing's information strategy, the report adds, would aim to quietly turn Taiwan's population against its own government and allies — amplifying stories questioning President Lai Ching-te's competence, spreading rumors of military fuel hoarding and blackouts, and circulating claims that the U.S., Japan and Australia would hesitate to intervene.

China's propaganda campaign could also reach the American public, the authors warn, through efforts to ""seed questions across U.S. online ecosystems designed to wear down the American public's commitment to continued convoy operations.""

For now, the contest remains theoretical. But as China builds the tools to choke Taiwan's energy supply and shape its narrative abroad, the line between peace and pressure is narrowing. The exercise suggests the first shot in the next Taiwan crisis may not be fired at all.

Trisha Yearwood spoke with Fox News Digital at the CMT Music Awards saying it's been her family who have kept her grounded throughout her success.

Trisha Yearwood explained why she put her career on pause after marrying country music star Garth Brooks.

Yearwood chose to focus on her marriage and family, despite her initial success with the 1991 hit, ""She's in Love with the Boy."" Yearwood's self-titled debut album – which went double platinum – cemented her as one of the leading female country music artists of the 1990s. That all changed for Yearwood in the 2000s.

""When I married Garth and I moved to Oklahoma, I stopped,"" Yearwood said at the ""In Her Own Words: An Evening with Trisha Yearwood"" event, according to People magazine.

""I wasn't touring 200 days a year anymore,"" she explained. ""I was a bonus mom to three children, and I was trying to make a marriage work, because I had learned that marriages don't work if you're never together.""

She emphasized that being physically present was a deliberate choice to build a strong family life.

""That's kind of important. You have to be together,"" she added. ""I made a conscious effort to be there, to go to soccer games and cook dinner.""

Yearwood and Brooks have been married since 2005, and she is a ""bonus mom"" to his three children: Taylor, August and Allie, from his marriage to Sandy Mahl.

The two started out as friends in the 1980s and often collaborated together before Brooks' divorce in 2001. They struck up a romantic relationship and married in a private ceremony near Tulsa, Oklahoma.

TRISHA YEARWOOD CALLS GARTH BROOKS 'LOVE OF MY LIFE,' THANKS HIM FOR BEING HER CHEERLEADER

Since marrying, Yearwood has been outspoken about how she consciously shifted some parts of her career and prioritized family life. When the musician was honored with the inaugural June Carter Cash Humanitarian award at 2024 CMT Music Awards, she credited her family for keeping her grounded.

""I was raised by really great parents,"" Yearwood exclusively shared with Fox News Digital at the time. ""My mom and dad, who are both passed on, but they're still with me ... My sister's my date tonight because Garth couldn't be here. It's family. It's about how you're raised.""

She added, ""I always say, 'I don't always do the right thing, but I know what the right thing is because of how I was raised.' It's them; it's my family.""

Throughout the 1990s, Yearwood saw success with songs such as ""Walkaway Joe,"" ""The Song Remembers When,"" ""XXX's and OOO's (An American Girl)"" and ""How Do I Live.""

Yearwood took home three Grammy Awards and received several honors from the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music.

After taking a step back from her music career, Yearwood found a new passion. She premiered her own southern-inspired cooking show on the Food Network in 2012. ""Trisha's Southern Kitchen"" ran for 17 seasons before its conclusion in 2022.

She received a Daytime Emmy Award for the show and also authored several cookbooks.

The ""There Goes My Baby"" singer has seen support from Brooks throughout it all. Yearwood recently referred to Brooks as the ""love of my life"" after receiving her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in March.

""He's my person. He has accomplished so much in his career, but he is happiest when other people win,"" she told Extra. 

""And I think he just believes in me so much, and he believes that I deserve more than I believe I deserve, so I know that he's genuinely the happiest person here today.""

Fox News' Bryan Llenas provides details on the unrest in Haiti and efforts to rescue Americans as gang uprisings in Port-au-Prince force residents to flee to the Dominican Republic.

Threats from Haitian gangs reportedly prompted the United Nations (U.N.) and foreign embassies to advise staff to stay off the streets of the capital Port-au-Prince Monday.

U.N. security directed staff to work remotely and restrict travel in the West region, while Haiti's National Police canceled all personnel leave until further notice, according to The Miami Herald.

Mathias Gillmann, a spokesperson with the U.N. Integrated Office in Haiti, confirmed to Fox News Digital in an email that staff were asked to work from home for the day. 

Public threats from a powerful Haitian gang leader began circulating on social media in recent days following weekend security operations from the Haitian National Police, the Armed Forces of Haiti and the Gang Suppression Force (GSF), a multinational mission, authorized by the U.N. Security Council.

Jimmy Chérizier, widely known as ""Barbecue,"" appeared in a video shared Sunday by an independent Haitian media outlet, urging people to stay home on Nov. 17 so they wouldn't ""be a victim,"" according to a brief translation of his remarks.

""Those who don't need to, do not go out into the streets. Leave the streets to 'Viv Ansanm' and the police so that we can confront them,"" ""Barbecue"" is quoted as saying, according to HaitiLibre, an independent Haitian news site based in Port-au-Prince.

LEADER OR KILLER? A DAY WITH ‘BARBECUE' IN HAITI'S CAPITAL

Viv Ansanm is a Haitian gang coalition that was designated by the U.S. State Department as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist and Foreign Terrorist Organization in May.

It was formed in September 2023 through an alliance between the two main gang factions operating in Port-au-Prince, G-9 and G-Pép.

A Kenyan Police armored vehicle patrols the Solino district in Port-au-Prince on Nov. 16, 2024, days after the area came under control of the ""Viv Ansanm"" gang alliance. 

The GSF said in an X post on Sunday that, together with specialized units from the Haitian National Police and the Armed Forces of Haiti, it carried out a security operation against the leadership and members of the 400 Mawozo gang that led to the deaths of several gang members.

The Friday operation resulted in the seizure of multiple weapons, including an M50-caliber Barrett rifle, six assault rifles and three pistols, they said.

""This operation sends a clear and unequivocal message: the era of unchecked gang dominance is over. Haiti's security institutions are mobilizing all available capabilities; on land, at sea, and in the air, to restore peace, protect communities, and ensure that every Haitian can exercise their basic human rights without fear of violence,"" read a statement from GSF. ""Joint intelligence-driven operations and continuous security patrols will persist until these criminal groups are decisively defeated.""

GSF said a Haitian National Police helicopter providing aerial support during the operation was forced to make an emergency landing due to a mechanical malfunction. 

The team on board was evacuated by ground units, who came under heavy gang fire while conducting the rescue.

On Thursday, U.S. Marines protecting the American Embassy in Haiti exchanged gunfire with suspected gang members. No service members were injured in the incident.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump's welcome marijuana crackdown","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3888012/trump-welcome-marijuana-crack-down/","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Despite millions of dollars spent by the marijuana industry, the Trump administration is cracking down on the drug, closing loopholes that have let the industry expand banefully in states that have not legalized it, and stepping up prosecutions of those who use it on federal lands.

This summer, reports surfaced that President Donald Trump had been telling donors he was considering moving marijuana from Schedule I — the strictest category under the Controlled Substances Act — to Schedule III, a lower tier that includes drugs such as ketamine and codeine. Such a shift would make marijuana easier to use legally and open financing options for the multibillion-dollar cannabis industry. This came after Trump endorsed a Florida ballot measure that would have legalized the drug in 2024.

But not only has there been no rescheduling announcement, but the legislation that ended the government shutdown this week also included a provision closing a loophole that inadvertently legalized certain marijuana products in all 50 states.

Language in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 was intended to allow the growing of hemp for use in rope and clothing products while keeping psychoactive versions of the plant illegal. But the text of the statute kept only the most common form of THC illegal. Creative marijuana enthusiasts were able to develop hemp plants with high levels of other forms of THC that had been unintentionally made legal. Hemp products with these alternative forms of THC, still as dangerous as regular THC, rapidly became a $3 billion industry.

The government funding bill that passed on Wednesday closed the loophole by banning the possession and sale of hemp with any type of THC in it. THC-infused drinks and edibles will soon disappear from convenience stores and smoke shops nationwide. Good riddance.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Wyoming also announced this week that, thanks to a Justice Department guidance memo sent in September, it would begin “rigorously” prosecuting people arrested for possession of marijuana on federal lands. The new Trump marijuana guidance comes after a Biden administration memo directed U.S. Attorneys not to prosecute marijuana possession cases.

Evidence that marijuana is far more harmful than industry proponents want you to believe was strong in 2018. It has only grown stronger since then. Marijuana use contributes to more car crashes and has been linked to higher rates of schizophrenia and lasting brain damage. Studies show the drug is far more addictive than advocates suggest. It is now three times stronger than it once was, and its use and abuse have risen in every state that has legalized it. 

NEWSOM PUSHES CLIMATE COLONIALISM IN BRAZIL

Before endorsing Florida's marijuana ballot measure in 2024, Trump had been a strong opponent of the harmful drug.  In 2015, he told the Conservative Political Action Conference that Colorado's legalization of marijuana was “bad,” an assessment he still held in 2018 when he correctly noted that, “in Colorado, they have more accidents,” adding, “it does cause an IQ problem.”

The Trump administration's renewed focus on marijuana enforcement is a welcome correction after years of industry expansion and Biden administration weakness. By shutting down the hemp-THC loophole and restoring federal prosecutions, Trump is reasserting a needed distinction between public health and corporate profit. He was right to question legalization years ago, and he is right to rein it in now. Voters who care about safety, health, and accountability will be grateful for the effort.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","They knew Epstein was guilty of trafficking underage girls. They stuck with him anyway. Except Trump","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/daily-memo/3889197/people-knew-jeffrey-epstein-trafficking-underage-girls-stuck-with-him-anyway-except-trump/","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:18:34 GMT","

THEY KNEW EPSTEIN WAS GUILTY OF TRAFFICKING UNDERAGE GIRLS. THEY STUCK WITH HIM ANYWAY. EXCEPT TRUMP. In 2014, the journalist-turned-adviser Michael Wolff wrote an unpublished profile of Jeffrey Epstein. This was a few years after Epstein served a prison sentence for sex trafficking a minor girl. Epstein gave Wolff, who had once hoped to go into business with the financier, access to his “absurdly vast house” in Manhattan and his life in it. We have the profile Wolff wrote because he emailed it to Epstein — not the sort of thing most journalists would do — and it was made public in the 20,000-plus documents House Republicans released last week.

The theme of the profile is that many prominent and accomplished people decided to maintain their friendships with Epstein even after an investigation showed he lured a number of underage girls to his house for sex. He then pleaded guilty to one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of procuring a minor for prostitution. In an infamous sweetheart deal, Epstein received an 18-month sentence that allowed him to come and go freely while spending nights in “jail.”

“He got out of jail in 2009, serving 13 months, and moved seamlessly back into his life, to the shock-shock of tabloids whenever they are reminded of his existence,” Wolff wrote. “Some things changed. While surprisingly few others dropped him, the Clintons did, an irony of the present tabloid interest in Epstein's old address book with its many Clinton contacts. And his sex offender status has transformed him from libertine playboy to pedophile in tabloid parlance.”

The article is a long list of people who hung around with post-prison Epstein. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, “for whom Epstein has become a key adviser,” was helping Epstein deal with his image problems. Mort Zuckerman, “the real estate billionaire and owner of the Daily News.” PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel. Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury Secretary and president of Harvard University. Ehud Barak, the former prime minister of Israel. Then-Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim. The lawyer Reid Weingarten. Thorbjørn Jagland, then-head of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee. Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia. Nathan Myhrvold, a former top executive at Microsoft. Harvard professor Martin Nowak. Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. Investment fund manager Ron Baron. Josh Harris, owner of the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Devils. And then: “A high ranking official from the Obama White House, whose name I am asked not to use.”

They all came to Epstein's house in New York. “These meetings, and this lifestyle, have somehow stayed private or secret — or apart — not out of any formal or stated restrictions, but because, in some sense, it would be very hard to explain just what you're doing there with a brazen sex offender in a guffaw-inducing home flaunting all moderation,” Wolff wrote. “And yet, defying disgrace, and tolerating his tone deafness — or mocking attitude toward the zeitgeist — so many come. Gladly. Willingly. Feeling that his invitation is quite an extraordinary privilege.”

Wolff went to some length to note the constant presence of young women around the Epstein house. Wolff described them as being “in their twenties and thirties” — he did not say any were underage — and acting as “Epstein's support staff and companions.” The “Hefnerian prurience” in the house, Wolff said, was “somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and ‘Eyes Wide Shut.'” Wolff concluded that the atmosphere “may be part of the appeal for the men who come to visit Epstein.” After trying to explain the situation, Wolff ended up saying, “The constant attendance of so many comely young women seems so outside of conventional living or staffing or social or romantic relationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward or straight-faced way.”

Given today's political situation and the things Wolff has been saying recently, here is something interesting. Out of all the names dropped, one is conspicuously absent: Donald Trump. The billionaire developer, reality TV star, and future president, who had a falling out with Epstein around 2004, did not even merit mention as a former friend. Wolff saw fit to name former President Bill Clinton as absent, but Trump, who at that point had not yet entered national politics, was just not there. Some years later, of course, after Trump became president, his adversaries saw Epstein, like they once saw Russia, as an opportunity to bring him down, and the Epstein story became all about Trump. But in 2014, when Epstein was alive and active and Wolff wrote the profile, Trump wasn't part of the picture.

TRUMP CALLS ON HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO PASS BILL RELEASING FULL EPSTEIN FILES

Maybe that tells you something is wrong with the way the story is being reported today. Whenever new information is released, such as the thousands of documents recently made public by the House GOP, and when that new information contains nothing to incriminate Trump, the usual suspects loudly proclaim that more new information is still being hidden that will incriminate Trump. It must all be released! One prominent Democratic senator, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, literally said recently, “Clearly, Donald Trump was at the center of a child sex ring. That is heartbreaking that the President of the United States was involved in that kind of gross, craven immorality.” 

That is a positively surrealistic read on what we know about Epstein so far — and we know a lot. But do not expect Murphy or any of his allies to stop. In their world, the absence of evidence is simply more evidence of Trump's guilt. As long as they believe they can benefit politically from the story, they'll keep pushing it.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Et tu, Brute? It is with profound sadness that I report the death of a once-cherished cultural touchstone: South Park. Cause of death: Trump derangement syndrome. The decline began a decade ago, around Season 19, with the introduction of PC Principal and a lurch into serialized storytelling.

Still, even in those uneven years, the show retained its anchoring instinct: Comedy came first and was never afflicted by ideology. That is what makes the creators' recent justification so dispiriting. “It's not that we got all political,” Trey Parker told the New York Times. “It's that politics became pop culture.” This, apparently, explains why the past two seasons have fixated almost exclusively on President Donald Trump and his administration.

The difference is not merely topical. It is tonal. South Park has never shied away from vulgarity (the firebrand cartoon is certainly not for everyone), but it was always rooted in a worthwhile punchline. Increasingly, however, the show has indulged in vulgarity for vulgarity's sake: Pam Bondi smeared with feces, JD Vance carrying on a romantic affair with Trump, Satan returning as Trump's codependent paramour.

Meanwhile, the four boys who once formed the show's emotional core have been relegated to cameo status, their adventures now tertiary to a sprawling Resistance-era soap opera. In South Park's heyday, political allegory was subtle and filtered through its world; consider 2004's “Douche and Turd,” a single-episode riff on the Bush-Kerry election that still revolved around the characters' elementary school. Today, we get multi-season tirades in place of sharp satire.

When Season 27 premiered, portraying Trump as a resurrected Saddam Hussein analogue, complete with Satan as his jilted lover, I was naive enough to hope this was a one-off gesture intended to put to rest the asinine notion that late night host Stephen Colbert was fired for “criticizing Trump.” Instead, it became clear this would be the show's new organizing principle. It has abandoned everything that once set it above the late night monoculture. South Park has become a show you visit to hear MSNBC-level monologues with crasser delivery.

What makes this shift especially perplexing is the creators' insistence that their new direction is somehow rebellious. In the same New York Times interview, Matt Stone claims he and Parker “sensed a fear of speaking out against the administration” and that “new taboos had emerged.” This notion is patently delusional given their own history. Parker and Stone lampooned Trump relentlessly in 2015's Season 19 through the Mr. Garrison surrogate. If mocking Trump were a career-ending taboo, where were the gallows then?

To their credit, glimmers of the old show remain. Its spoofing of crypto grifters (Hawk Tuah girl) and AI-generated deepfakes offers sharp observations of contemporary absurdity. But these ideas exist only as side quests orbiting the Trump–Satan baby storyline. If South Park is ever to be made great again (to borrow a phrase), it must invert this formula. The boys should be the story; the politics, if present at all, should be mocked through their lens.

Compounding the problem is the show's abandonment of the “equal-opportunity offender” ethos the creators claim to uphold. There was, bizarrely, an entire episode blaming Benjamin Netanyahu for rising antisemitism in America — an Al Jazeera–esque moral framing wildly out of character for a show that (outside Saddam, bin Laden, a few dictators, and Canada) rarely waded into geopolitics at all.

The show took a swing at Charlie Kirk, only to drop the plotline entirely after his tragic murder. But if podcast punditry is fair game, where is the satire of Hasan Piker — currently enjoying glossy PR profiles in the New York Times and Vanity Fair? What about Zohran Mamdani, the trust-fund socialist newly elected mayor of New York? Or, for that matter, anything resembling a joke about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) or the House's Hamas caucus of Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI)?

These are genuine taboos and the ones late night hosts will not touch, no matter how many self-inflicted gaffes they generate. Yet Stone and Parker seem fixated on scolding one Trump Cabinet member after another.

Even more conspicuously absent is any commentary on President Joe Biden, a man whose declining cognition became a national scandal only after he left office, or Kamala Harris, whose oratorical style consists of word salads punctuated by nervous laughter. Defenders of the show often cite streaming-rights litigation as the reason South Park skipped the Biden years.

LIBERALS MAD PROMINENT CONSERVATIVES AREN'T UPSET OVER SOUTH PARK JOKES

But Parker and Stone undercut that excuse themselves in a 2024 interview, admitting they were “exhausted” with politics and simply opted out of the election cycle. What changed between then and now? They never say. But the result is unmistakable: A show that once skewered cultural absurdities now indulges them.

And so, we arrive at present-day South Park, a once-great institution hollowed out by its own narrative compulsions. Comedy becomes stale and dies when it becomes consumed by a single target for too long. The tragedy is not that South Park mocks Trump; it is that Trump is all it appears to know how to mock anymore.

An Indiana Republican lawmaker underwent a swatting incident on Sunday after President Donald Trump called him a “RINO” for opposing the Republican Party's mid-decade redistricting agenda.

State Sen. Greg Goode was the target of the swatting incident. His household was reported for a false emergency in a prank email to the Terre Haute Police Department. The email was sent around 5 p.m. Sunday, according to local authorities. Deputies responded to the home shortly thereafter, only to find there was no emergency and that the home belonged to the state senator.

“Attempts were initially unsuccessful to raise anyone at the residence, but ultimately contact was made with persons inside the home,” the Vigo County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. “All persons were secure, safe, and unharmed. Investigation showed that this was a prank or false email.”

The sheriff's office declined to share further details amid the investigation, but it denounced the swatting incident for wasting officers' time and putting the victims in harm's way.

“A false or prank call of this nature will never be acceptable,” the statement reads. “Not only do calls like this waste and reduce resources of deputies serving and protecting other parts of our county, they have a negative impact on the victim and their families as well. Our office along with federal authorities will investigate this incident with every intention of discovering who is responsible.”

The false email came hours after Trump criticized Goode and Rodric Bray, president pro tempore of the Indiana Senate, for abandoning his redistricting effort to gain two more House GOP seats in Indiana ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

On Friday, Bray announced that the Indiana Senate would not reconvene in December to proceed with redrawing the state's congressional map. The lawmaker said there were not enough votes in favor of the idea.

The state legislature's rejection of partisan gerrymandering came in spite of the White House's outreach to Indiana Republicans over the past few months.

Trump said he was “very disappointed” in the result, taking aim at Goode and Bray.

“Because of these two politically correct type ‘gentlemen,'” he wrote on Truth Social, “and a few others, they could be depriving Republicans of a Majority in the House, A VERY BIG DEAL!”

Vice President JD Vance visited the state's lawmakers in August and again in October to encourage them to take up redistricting. Seven out of nine members of Indiana's congressional delegation are Republicans. A new map would turn the entire delegation red.

Trump also suggested that Gov. Mike Braun (R-IN), whom he called a “friend of mine,” did not do enough to get the votes needed for a redistricting measure. Despite the criticism leveled against him, Braun expressed his displeasure with the Indiana Senate's inaction on the issue.

“Considering that Mike wouldn't be Governor without me (Not even close!), is disappointing!” the president said.

Indiana Republicans previously visited the White House for a meeting with Trump. Afterward, Braun warned that there could be funding repercussions for not working with the Trump administration.

Later in the message, Trump implored Goode and Bray to do their jobs and, if they did not, suggested they risk being booted out of office.

In response to the swatting incident, Goode called for civility.

TRUMP RIPS ‘POLITICALLY CORRECT' INDIANA REPUBLICANS FOR ABANDONING REDISTRICTING EFFORT

“Vigo County sheriff's deputies responded to the incident under the impression of a domestic violence emergency,” he wrote on X. “The deputies professionally fulfilled their duty.

“While this entire incident is unfortunate and reflective of the volatile nature of our current political environment, I give thanks to God that my family and I are ok.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Supreme Court will hear arguments in a pair of cases in the coming months, which could significantly affect how much candidates coordinate spending with political parties and which mail ballots are counted ahead of next year's highly contested midterm elections.

The justices have been preparing to hear arguments in the campaign finance law case National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission next month but opted to add Watson v. Republican National Committee, a case about a mail ballot counting law, to the docket for arguments later this term. The two cases, both involving the Republican Party, are poised to have a significant impact on the looming midterm elections.

On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to take up Watson v. RNC, which centers on the question of whether Mississippi's law allowing mail ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they are received up to five days later is preempted by a federal statute setting Election Day nationwide.

Jason Snead, executive director of the Honest Elections Project, told the Washington Examiner the crux of the RNC's challenge to the law is that ballots should only count if they have been “received by an election official by the date that the election concludes.”

“It's the act of casting the ballot by giving it to an election official that cements the deal,” Snead said. “And until that has happened, a ballot is not considered cast, and therefore you cannot have ballots coming in after Election Day, because that means de facto votes are being cast after the election is concluded.”

RNC Chairman Joe Gruters said after the high court agreed to take up the case that he is hopeful the justices will uphold the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit's ruling that counting mail ballots arriving after Election Day is unconstitutional.

“Allowing states to count large numbers of mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day undermines trust and confidence in our elections,” Gruters said. “Elections must end on Election Day, which is why the RNC led the way in challenging this harmful state law.”

Mail ballot deadlines vary by state, but most require ballots to be received on or before Election Day. Only a minority of states accept ballots postmarked by Election Day that arrive later.

In Mississippi, mail ballots are accepted up to five business days after Election Day. In some other states, the deadlines are longer. In Illinois, ballots are accepted up to 14 days after Election Day, while in California, mail ballots can be received up to seven days after Election Day.

Snead said that if the high court opts to strike down the Mississippi law and other post-Election Day mail ballot deadline laws, it would be a change for some states, but not for most states across the country.

“The argument has been made that this is going to be massively disruptive and that this is going to disenfranchise voters, but I think that neither one of those is true,” Snead said. “I think it is fairly easy, if you are a state that has a policy to allow a ballot to be received and counted after Election Day, simply change the receipt deadline to line up with in-person voting rights.”

“We say the close of polls is the close of polls, and that's when voting stops,” he added. “And it would be fairly easy to establish the same policy for mail-in voting.”

He also said there is a “huge upside to the public's confidence in the elections,” because the Supreme Court will decide the case before the hotly contested midterm elections.

“We will not run the risk of deciding this legal question in a postelection context, where the Supreme Court will not only be answering the question of what federal law does or does not do, but also likely who is going to win and who is going to lose, which party is going to control Congress, potentially,” Snead said.

The Supreme Court has not scheduled oral arguments for Watson v. RNC, but the case is expected to be heard sometime between February and the end of April 2026.

Next month, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in NRSC v. FEC, where it will look at the legality of the FEC's coordinated spending limits between political parties and candidates. The NRSC, the GOP's Senate campaign wing, sued the FEC over the limits, alleging they violate a political party's First Amendment rights.

“Since their inception, these coordinated party expenditure limits have been a form of speech rationing in search of a rationale,” the NRSC's brief to the Supreme Court reads. “Given that they were enacted to reduce what incumbents saw as wasteful and excessive campaign spending by political parties, the government has spent decades casting about for a way to recharacterize them as an anti-corruption measure.”

The Democratic National Committee, which intervened in the lawsuit after the Trump administration said it would not defend the FEC limits, warned in its brief to the high court that ruling in favor of the NRSC would “fundamentally reshape the campaign finance regime” and that the “potential for actual or apparent corruption is obvious.” The DNC points to concerns over “quid pro quo corruption” as a reason that the limits should be upheld.

Supporters of the NRSC's argument to strike down the coordinated expenditure limits argue that it is difficult to point to exactly how parties and their candidates coordinating spending leads directly to bribery.

“The constitutional argument that's really relevant here is you've got to show me the corruption,” Dan Greenberg, senior research fellow at the Cato Institute, told the Washington Examiner. “You've got to come up with some plausible theory of bribery, and if you don't have that, then regulation is really not constitutional.”

Greenberg also noted that if the high court strikes down the coordinated expenditure limits, then political parties could regain some of their power in swaying campaigns.

“We live in an era of American history where parties are incredibly weak, and I think that if these regulations were struck down, it would certainly help parties to become relatively stronger,” Greenberg said.

Oral arguments for NRSC v. FEC before the justices are scheduled for Dec. 9.

SUPREME COURT POISED TO SHAKE UP MIDTERM ELECTIONS

Opinions in both cases are expected to be released by the end of June 2026, meaning any changes to election rules caused by the high court's decision would be in time for the midterm elections in November 2026. They are expected to be hotly contested as control of the House of Representatives and the Senate is at stake, alongside dozens of gubernatorial races.

Republicans control both chambers of Congress, but the party with the president in the White House tends to underperform in midterm elections. In 2018, during Trump's first term, Democrats regained control of the House, but Republicans retained control of the Senate. In 2022, during former President Joe Biden's only term, the GOP regained control of the House, while Democrats maintained control of the Senate.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The United States will designate the Venezuela-based Cartel of the Suns as a foreign terrorist organization in one week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced on Sunday evening.

“The Department of State intends to designate Cartel de los Soles as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), effective November 24, 2025,” Rubio said in a press release. “Cartel de los Soles by and with other designated FTOs including Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel are responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.”

Rubio also claimed the cartel is led by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and “his cronies,” who have “corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary.”

The intended designation follows a slew of them on other drug cartels last winter, shortly after President Donald Trump reentered the Oval Office. Those included Tren de Aragua, MS-13, and the Sinaloa Cartel, among others, all now designated as terrorist groups.

Notably, Cartel of the Suns was not included in that batch, though the Treasury Department did slap sanctions on it over the summer.

The move from the State Department comes at a precarious time in the region, as Trump has waged a war on drug trafficking and has singled out Maduro, who the U.S. views as an illegitimate leader, as one of its enablers.

It has led to a surge of U.S. military assets to the region, including over a dozen warships, as well as over 20 separate strikes on small, alleged drug vessels operating in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific.

The increased military action has led Venezuela to deploy “almost 200,000” service members and put “the entire country's military arsenal on full operational readiness,” according to Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez.

Venezuela's military is also reportedly weighing sabotage tactics in the event the U.S. launches strikes on targets within the country, something Trump has not yet authorized.

US STRIKES ANOTHER DRUG BOAT, PUTTING TOTAL AT OVER 20

Trump did say over the weekend that he has “sort of made up my mind” on what military action, if any, could be next. Though speaking to reporters on Sunday night, Trump appeared to leave the door open to negotiations with Venezuela.

“We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we'll see how that turns out — but they would like to talk,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

FCC chair Brendan Carr is on a crusade to Trumpify the airwaves.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The scandal that briefly made Brendan Carr a household name this fall was an outlier several times over. For one thing, FCC chairmen rarely make news. More than that, Carr usually knows better than to draw too much attention to himself. A seasoned bureaucrat, he has a knack for pulling the strings of power in ways that escape public scrutiny. But when he issued a mob-style threat over a Jimmy Kimmel monologue that Republicans didn't like—“We can do this the easy way or the hard way”—he made the Trump administration's appetite for censorship unignorable.

Most of the administration's efforts to manipulate the media up to that point had retained at least a patina of deniability. Here, by contrast, was an uncomplicated threat of government interference—one that prompted Disney, ABC's parent company, to fall in line by suspending Kimmel's show. This was too much even for some of the Trump administration's biggest cheerleaders; Senator Ted Cruz called Carr's comments “dangerous as hell.” After a few days of public outcry, Kimmel was back on the air.

The whole episode was an unusual misstep by a skilled Washington operator. The hallmark of Carr's tenure as chair of the Federal Communications Commission has been the exploitation of bureaucratic procedure to consolidate ownership of communications infrastructure in Trump-friendly hands, while keeping those actions out of both the court of public opinion and the literal courts. To liberals, this is an obvious attempt to rig the media. To conservatives, however, it is a long-overdue unrigging. Why should the national networks devote airtime every night to liberal comedians who incessantly mock Republicans? “For those that benefited from a two-tier system of justice, today's even handed treatment feels like discrimination,” Carr posted on X in March, paraphrasing the economist Thomas Sowell. The left, in other words, got so used to controlling the media that it doesn't even notice the bias.

“The public airwaves belong to the public, and yet for the past 40 or 50 years, they have been used and abused as a propaganda tool for one party's political agenda,” Daniel Suhr, the president of the Center for American Rights, a conservative litigation nonprofit, told me. “It doesn't matter whether you're watching NBC, ABC, CBS, or PBS; you're going to get the same left-wing viewpoints permeating both the news and the entertainment shows.”

Conservatives have been complaining about media bias for decades, but Republican officials were long averse to interfering with the decisions of private companies. Then came the second Trump administration, and its willingness to wage cultural warfare in more intrusive ways. Carr's role in that effort is not to tell networks what to air and whom to fire. It's to get to the point where he doesn't have to.

Adam Serwer: The Constitution protects Jimmy Kimmel's mistake

Carr is bald, with a trim white beard and rimless glasses, which makes him look older than his 46 years. A D.C. lifer, he was born in the capital, went to college at Georgetown, and got his law degree at Catholic University. He joined the staff of the FCC in 2012, while in his early 30s, and never left. In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated him to serve as one of the five commissioners. (Carr did not respond to multiple interview requests, and the FCC press office did not reply to a request for comment.)

During this period, Carr was not considered particularly ideological. “He and I started at the FCC around the same time, and he was pretty much a typical Republican staffer,” Gigi Sohn, a Democrat who was nominated but not confirmed for a seat on the commission during the Biden administration, told me. Colleagues from both parties found him smart, funny, and pleasant to work with. “I've always had an excellent relationship with Brendan, and I always respected his intelligence,” Tom Wheeler, who chaired the agency under Barack Obama, told me. “He used to call me up after I left office: ‘Let's go get lunch.'”

The current version of Carr—outspoken, politically ambitious, highly partisan—seems to have emerged in 2020. That May, Trump directed the FCC to “clarify” the meaning of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law that shields internet platforms from liability over their content-moderation policies. Republican dogma held that the major tech platforms were censoring conservatives, but the party remained divided over whether the government should get involved. “We should all reject demands, in the name of the First Amendment, for private actors to curate or publish speech in a certain way,” said Mike O'Rielly, one of the other Republican commissioners, in public remarks that summer. A few days later, the White House pulled his nomination for another term on the commission. (O'Rielly did not respond to interview requests.)

Carr took a different tack. In op-eds and at conferences, on cable news and podcasts, he advocated for Trump's idea, even though most legal experts agreed that the FCC had no authority to reinterpret Section 230. He also began “embracing a flavor of distinctly Trumpian rhetoric,” as Politico put it in June 2020, “that could help him leapfrog his way to the chairmanship of the five-member regulatory agency.” Carr earned attention and retweets from the president by taking rhetorical shots at a range of real and perceived Trump foes, including the World Health Organization (“beclowned”), Adam Schiff (running a “secret and partisan surveillance machine”), and the “far left” in general (going “from hoax to hoax to hoax to explain the loss at the ballot box”).

“He obviously has a natural talent for messaging and doing the press, which has surprised a lot of people who knew him way back when he was in the doldrums of the FCC,” Evan Swarztrauber, a telecom-policy consultant who worked as an adviser to Carr during the first Trump administration, told me.

During the Biden administration, while in the commission's minority, Carr contributed a chapter to Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation manifesto that has served as a blueprint for much of the second Trump administration. Compared with other parts of the document, Carr's contribution isn't particularly radical. It focuses mostly on countering the threat of Chinese technological espionage and reining in Big Tech by reforming Section 230. (As chair, Carr has pursued the first part of that agenda energetically; the preemptive capitulation of the princes of Big Tech rendered the second part unnecessary.) The chapter contained almost no mention of what has turned out to be the most important power he would actually wield.

Media regulation in the United States has historically been a hands-off affair. For the most part, the First Amendment lets the FCC police “obscenity, indecency and profanity,” and little else. Until recently, if the agency made headlines, it was probably because something naughty, such as Janet Jackson's exposed right breast, had made its way onto the airwaves.

The FCC normally focuses more on the infrastructure of communications. Its docket is stuffed with such vital but dry topics as 5G coverage and rural broadband. Even the controversy over “net neutrality,” which inflamed internet-policy nerds for years, turns on the achingly technical question of whether ISPs are properly classified as “information services” or “telecommunications services” under federal law. The FCC does not print money, bring lawsuits, or command armed agents. A pamphlet published by the agency in 2010 analyzes some of the “most critical” decisions in its history. These include “spectrum allocations and color standards for over-the-air television in 1945 and 1952,” “authorizing customers in 1968 to attach equipment to their telephone lines,” and “adopting technical standards for high-definition and digital television in 1996 and 1997.”

Beneath the mountains of tedium, however, lies real power. Whoever controls communications infrastructure can shape the informational environment. Using that power to advance political objectives requires someone with both technocratic know-how and the ambition to use it. According to friends and detractors alike, Carr is that person. “He knows the law very well, and he knows how to get results under the law without running afoul of it,” Swarztrauber told me.

The FCC's authority arises from its control of a scarce public good. Because wireless spectrum is a finite resource (only one radio station can occupy a given frequency in a given location, for example), the federal government allocates and regulates its use: not just for radio but also for broadcast television, satellites, and cellphones. “Spectrum is the most valuable asset that the government owns in the information economy, period, end of story,” Blair Levin, a former FCC attorney who oversaw the Obama administration's National Broadband Plan, told me.

Recipients of FCC broadcast licenses are required by law to operate in “the public interest, convenience, and necessity.” Only once, however, has the FCC revoked a license on these grounds, in a court-ordered 1969 decision concerning a southern TV station that refused to air news about the civil-rights movement. More recently, in 2018, a group of Democratic senators urged the agency to investigate Sinclair, then the country's biggest TV-station owner. The company had ordered dozens of local-news anchors to read identical scripts repeating Trump talking points about media bias and “fake stories.” In a letter, the senators warned that Sinclair might be “deliberately distorting news by staging, slanting, or falsifying information,” putting its licenses at risk. But the letter was a transparent messaging exercise. Ajit Pai, the agency's Republican chair, was never going to revoke Sinclair's licenses. Neither did his successor, the Joe Biden appointee Jessica Rosenworcel.

James Surowiecki: Nexstar and Sinclair lost their game of chicken

Carr, by contrast, has made no secret of his desire to make aggressive use of the public-interest standard. “Broadcast licenses are not sacred cows,” he declared on X in November 2024. One of his first acts as chair was to reopen a previously dismissed complaint accusing CBS News of “news distortion” over its editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, along with complaints against ABC and NBC. These proceedings were unlikely to go anywhere. Broadcast licenses belong to individual stations, not the big networks that produce the programming. Even if the FCC tried to revoke a station's license over claims of partisan bias, that move would likely be overturned in court.

But Carr has another method available with the advantage of being legally unreviewable. The FCC must approve any merger that involves the transfer of broadcast licenses. If the agency were to vote to block a merger for ideological reasons, the companies involved could sue—perhaps on First Amendment grounds, perhaps on the grounds that the agency's reasoning violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which forbids “arbitrary” and “capricious” policy making. But if the merger never comes up for a vote, there's nothing to challenge. And whether that happens is the chair's call.

“Being chairman of the FCC is one of the best jobs in Washington because you run the agency,” Wheeler told me. “There are four other commissioners, but those commissioners never get a chance to vote on something that the chairman hasn't already decided they should put on the agenda.”

When Carr reopened the CBS News complaint, the network's parent company, Paramount, was in the process of being bought by Skydance Media, controlled by David Ellison, the son of the billionaire Trump supporter Larry Ellison. The informal 180-day window for the FCC to approve the license transfers came and went without Carr putting the deal on the agenda. Finally, on July 1, CBS News agreed to pay $16 million to Trump's presidential-library fund to settle his personal lawsuit over the 60 Minutes interview. Trump insisted that this had nothing to do with the merger, but a few weeks later, the acquisition was approved. Carr denied having slow-walked the deal, but proudly announced that the network's new owner had been required to commit to various ideology-focused reforms, such as appointing an ombudsman to watch out for bias. “One thing that CBS has agreed to do as part of this transaction is to bring more fact-based, objective, unbiased coverage to their newsrooms,” Carr told PBS. Ellison has since hired Bari Weiss, the founder of the conservative-leaning publication The Free Press, to head CBS News.

Democrats who knew Carr from his early days at the FCC were appalled. “What's going on here is using the power of a so-called independent agency to make the president happy and resolve his grievances,” Gigi Sohn said. “And that's absolutely not what the agency is supposed to be about.” Conservative activists, however, were thrilled. “I think what Chairman Carr accomplished through the Paramount proceeding is a great example of how we move toward more balance, more ideological diversity, and in doing so really serve more customers,” Daniel Suhr, whose organization filed the news-distortion complaint, told me.

The key point is that if Carr indeed delayed a vote on the merger until CBS News made its concessions, his decision could not be challenged in court. “He has perfected a technique where avoiding the process of the Administrative Procedure Act gives him unappealable power,” Wheeler said. “It's a hell of a technique.”

If the Skydance-Paramount merger doesn't strike you as sufficiently technical and bureaucratic, consider the case of Charlie Ergen and Elon Musk. In 2019, as part of a merger approval, the government required Sprint to sell some of its wireless-spectrum licenses to Ergen's satellite-TV company, Dish Network. Dish, which Ergen has since merged into a company called EchoStar, would have until 2025 to build out a new national cell network, or it could be forced to forfeit the valuable spectrum it had purchased.

In 2024, the Biden FCC granted the company an extension. But Musk coveted some of the spectrum that EchoStar controlled—specifically, on the 2-gigahertz band, which is ideal for “direct-to-cell” satellite service. In April, his company SpaceX sent a letter to the FCC accusing EchoStar of not meeting its build-out obligations and urging the agency to take action.

One month later, Carr sent Ergen a letter suggesting that the FCC might overturn the extension that his company had already received. Some of the letter's key passages consisted of impenetrable jargon. “I have also asked agency staff to issue a public notice seeking comment on the scope and scale of MSS utilization in the 2 GHz band that is currently licensed to EchoStar or its affiliates,” Carr wrote. But the message was clear. “The FCC threatens such severe sanctions that they put EchoStar's financial viability in question and threaten to kill the company,” Nathan Simington, a fellow Republican who had recently resigned his seat on the commission, wrote in an op-ed criticizing the investigation.

Ergen tried to meet with Carr, to no avail. Finally, Chris Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax—grateful that Dish had kept his right-wing network on the air when other broadcasters had not—brokered a White House meeting with Trump, according to the New York Post. The president arranged a deal: EchoStar would sell some of its spectrum to AT&T for $23 billion, and some to SpaceX for $17 billion. Trump's largest campaign contributor got the spectrum he craved, and Ergen got an enormous payout.

Carr hailed the agreement as “a potential game changer for the American consumer.” But an editorial by the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board decried the backroom deal, arguing that the administration's “rampant regulatory intervention in markets on behalf of businesses that do their bidding is giving Democrats the evidence to build a case that Republicans are the new kings of crony capitalism.”

If Carr had tried to formally order Ergen to give up the spectrum, Ergen might have successfully sued. But that would have taken years, by which time he would have long gone bankrupt. Instead, the deal was brokered behind closed doors, with no agency vote for anyone to challenge. “Brendan Carr is smart,” Sohn said. “He's been at the FCC since 2012, so he knows how these things work. None of these things are reviewable.”

Through September, Carr's tenure was marked by an unflashy use of the levers of bureaucratic power to deliver wins for Trump and his allies. Then came l'affaire Kimmel. A few days after Charlie Kirk's assassination, Kimmel falsely implied that the killer was a Trump supporter: “We hit some new lows over the weekend,” he said in his opening monologue, “with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.”

A right-wing campaign arose to get Kimmel taken off the air. Two days after the offending monologue, Carr, in an interview with the right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson, made his famous “the easy way or the hard way” comment. This was widely interpreted as a threat directed at ABC, which airs Jimmy Kimmel Live, and the broadcast affiliates around the country that carry it. Later that day, Nexstar and Sinclair, which together operate about a quarter of the country's ABC affiliates, announced that they would replace Kimmel with other programming. (Nexstar is considered conservative-leaning, though less aggressively so than Sinclair.) Soon thereafter, ABC announced that Kimmel was suspended indefinitely. Carr gloated by sharing celebratory GIFs on X. In a CNBC interview the day after the suspension, he evaded questions about whether he was responsible for taking Kimmel off the air while suggesting that he would have been justified for doing so. “Broadcast is different” from online speech, he explained. “They've got a license, and they're free to go on the internet and do whatever they want. But if they want to keep access to those valuable airwaves, I've been clear: We're reinvigorating the FCC's enforcement of public interest.”

Paul Farhi: Brendan Carr's half-empty threat

Carr might have underestimated how much backlash the move would generate. Less than a week after suspending him, Disney abruptly put Kimmel back on the air. As public opinion turned, Carr and his allies offered a mix of defenses: Kimmel had in fact been suspended because of poor ratings; Democrats had done worse, anyway, such as with the 2018 letter accusing Sinclair of news distortion; how could the suspension have been censorship if Kimmel was back on the air a few days later? These did not quell the outrage. Carr seemed to dial back his media appearances. His X inbox, which had been open to DMs from anyone, went private. He kept a low profile as, inevitably, the public's attention moved on.

Carr has not gone away, however. If anything, the episode only proved his point that the national networks have too much leverage over local broadcast affiliates. Sinclair and Nexstar had wanted to extend the Kimmel boycott, but they couldn't. ABC, with its control of must-have properties such as Monday Night Football, held the advantage.

Shifting that balance of power seems to be Carr's next big project. At the time of the Kimmel controversy, it was widely observed that Nexstar was seeking FCC approval to acquire Tegna, another large chain of affiliates, for $6.2 billion. This fact actually understates the FCC's leverage. Under federal law, no company can own TV stations that reach more than 39 percent of American households. The Nexstar merger would take the combined company all the way to 80 percent. “The deal that Tegna and Nexstar signed is an illegal transaction,” Wheeler told me. “Yet they still went ahead and did the deal, because Carr has been indicating that he will change that rule.” As of late October, Carr said he hadn't decided whether to raise the ownership limit. But Tegna and Nexstar clearly believe they have good reason to think the change will go through.

Carr has also long been suspicious of local ownership limits. Currently, one company can own up to two stations within a given market. On September 30, the FCC announced the first step of the process to amend those rules. (Both changes will require commission votes and thus are sure to be challenged in court. The 39 percent national cap is written into statute; whether the FCC can change it without an act of Congress is disputed.)

Carr has a perfectly nonpartisan rationale for these moves. He argues that allowing more mergers will make broadcasters more efficient and resilient, giving them more bargaining power against the ABCs of the world. “The agenda that I'm trying to run at the FCC is to empower those actual local television stations to serve the public interest,” he told CNBC in May. “Because what we've seen is, you've got national news media—ABC, NBC, CBS—and they're exercising more and more control over those local TV stations. I don't think that's a good thing for the country, so we're trying to reverse that.” According to Swarztrauber, Carr's professed concern for local broadcasters is sincere. “I was working for him in 2018, and he believed that broadcasting was going to go the way of the newspaper if the FCC didn't deregulate it,” he told me. “He was saying that in 2018.”

Still, allowing more mergers will, by definition, concentrate the “local” TV market even more heavily in the hands of a few national companies—companies that just so happen to have a rightward slant. They will know whom to thank for their good fortune. In the age of cable, social media, and streaming, broadcast TV is of course far less consequential than it once was. But even as it declines, it still commands a significant audience, especially among older Americans. As Carr himself is very fond of pointing out, local news enjoys much higher levels of trust than the rest of the media.

And broadcast TV is just one part of a multipronged effort. Skydance, fresh off of absorbing Paramount, is the favorite to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in a mega-deal that would give the Ellison dynasty control over dozens of cable networks, including CNN. Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corporation and Larry Ellison's Oracle are among the investors expected to have control over the American version of TikTok; Oracle would oversee the algorithm that recommends videos to users. (The final details of the pending Trump-brokered deal with China remain hazy.)

Developments such as these, along with Silicon Valley's rightward shift and the ideological concessions in higher education, bring the MAGA movement closer to realizing a long-held dream: using state power to achieve cultural power. Many Republicans believe that media bias has given Democrats an unfair political advantage, and that once they correct that imbalance, they will reap electoral rewards.

They might be right about that. If you can shape what people see and hear, you can influence their beliefs. But the relationship between culture and politics is not always so straightforward. Liberal hegemony within media, education, and entertainment might very well be the reason the Democratic Party finds itself so out of touch with, and disliked by, broad segments of the American public. Carr and his allies might someday discover that being the establishment is not all it's cracked up to be.

Anika Jade Levy's debut novel captures what it feels like to try to become an artist right now.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Some people draw an easy, maybe even lazy, distinction between two generations: Gen Z performs coolness and irony, while Millennials are the cohort of political correctness and cringe. Gen Z wears low-rise jeans while Millennials post things such as “You can pry these high-rise pants from my cold, dead hands!” These theories might make for a fun 30-second TikTok, but they have become so commonplace as to be almost meaningless. As I read Anika Jade Levy's debut novel, Flat Earth, I wondered if it might actually say something new, not just about what it means to be a member of Gen Z, but about what it feels like to come of age as an artist—and a person—in this particularly vexed American moment.

Flat Earth opens with an Adderall shortage in New York City, a consequence of supply-chain breakdowns and worsening relations with China. Without stimulants, 26-year-old Avery, a graduate student in a media-studies program, is unable to write. She's supposed to be working on “a book of cultural reports, but it wasn't taking shape.” Instead, she heads off on a summer trip with her best friend, Frances, another grad student, who's making a documentary about “rural isolation and right-wing conspiracy theories.” The two friends take a road trip together, driving from the Georgia Guidestones to a flat-Earth conference in Dallas. Frances interviews people and Avery films handheld footage, neglecting her own work. “I must have known, even then,” Avery thinks, “that Frances's project was more important than mine. I envied her clarity of vision, the inevitability of her success. I would have followed her anywhere.”

Flat Earth seems to both share and sneer at Frances's desire “to make something really American” (the book and Frances's film share a title). The novel satirizes contemporary society and its discontents, indexing the internet's alienating effects, the rightward political swing of many young men (and women), and the absurdities of the New York City art scene. But Avery's complicated reflections on Frances's work are about more than the state of the nation: Her floundering attempts to write, and her intense jealousy of her friend's easy success, point to a deeper truth about the precarity of making art today.

Read: A powerful indictment of the art world

Humming in the background of Levy's novel is a field undergoing a crisis: As funding for the arts declines, as rents go up and freelance rates fail to keep pace with inflation, as generative artificial intelligence grows more prevalent by the day, many artists struggle to find an outlet or audience for their work, and to live off it. Think of the New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino, who recently caught flak for announcing (in a since-deleted Instagram post) that she would break her “RIGID sponcon ban” to create an Airbnb “experience” for her followers. This mirrors the world of Flat Earth, where writers might critique the commodification of everyday life and work for corporations on the side. Levy's novel argues that artists don't have an authentic position to create from, that everything is corrupted by money.

Indeed, money is everywhere in Flat Earth, especially in its relationships. Avery and Frances's friendship is marked by their opposite financial situations: Avery has no safety net, while Frances gets a monthly allowance of $10,000 from her wealthy southern parents. Avery is a careful observer, a natural scorekeeper. She notices how frequently Frances changes herself in order to win people over. In New York, Frances takes on the persona of a struggling grad student; on their road trip, she becomes a regular American girl, the daughter of a cattle rancher. At one point, she talks about wanting to work as an escort to get money for her film (the novel is unclear about whether she follows through). Avery's reaction is caustic: She thinks Frances is proposing this “only because she hoped she might get herself sex-murdered by one of these men so that the girls in our department would mythologize her forever and she'd finally get her 16-millimeter films screened.”

But Frances doesn't get sex-murdered. She finishes her film, goes home to North Carolina, and gets engaged. She drops out of graduate school to marry “a day laborer she had gone to high school with.” At Frances's wedding, Avery observes that her friend has morphed again, adopting a quasi-tradwife identity. The ceremony is accentuated by the groom's sisters donning Confederate-flag bikinis and groomsmen holding camouflage-decaled AR-15s. Back in New York, Frances becomes the toast of the art world; her films are screened in galleries. Avery doesn't have the benefits of such success, but at least she has, for now, her integrity: She can feel superior to her shape-shifting friend without ever having written or made anything herself.

But in Levy's novel, no one can make it as a writer without selling out. Scrambling to make her tuition payment, Avery starts getting paid to escort and have sex with rich men, an idea Frances once toyed with. In between dates, she tries to write her book. But one night, under the hazy influence of Ambien, she applies to an entry-level job at a new right-wing dating app called Patriarchy. She gets the job, which involves swiping on the app, going on dates with men, and writing weekly reports about her experience. These men are not her type; she usually seeks the company of inaccessible, intellectual men who encourage her self-destructive behavior. Patriarchy instead targets “men who eat uncooked organ meat, sports gambling enthusiasts, porn-sick degenerates, downwardly mobile white men in red states,” as one executive says to Avery. “Don't look at me like that, sweetheart. I'm not the one who deindustrialized the Rust Belt and sent all our manufacturing overseas.” As Frances tells Avery, “All work is sex work. Your mother should just be happy you're such a mascot for social mobility.” Avery, for her part, hopes she can at least glean some material for her book.

The novel includes some heavy-handed moments. More than once, Avery's shattered phone screen leaves her thumbs bloody from scrolling, an obvious metaphor for the sometimes painful experience of being online. But there are more subtle scenes that speak to the weirdness of American life, such as when Avery sees climate activists outside the Pacific Fuels and Convenience Summit—a “multiday networking event for oilmen and gas station operators”—getting arrested. “Leaving the Convention Center, the cops had encircled the protestors. The girls looked good in their summer dresses, zip ties fastened around their tiny wrists.” Avery registers the scene only on a surface level—these beautiful, thin girls!—rather than plumbing for any deeper meaning in this collision of climate change and corporate profit and law enforcement.

By far the best parts of Flat Earth are the deeply cynical interludes between chapters, implied to be excerpts from a white paper that Avery wrote for Patriarchy before getting fired for not embodying the app's values. These missives are bizarre and prophetic, and certainly not an acceptable work product. They read like fiery tweets or diary entries, influenced by the men Avery dates and her general feeling that society is regressing. As she writes in one, “The men are playing with unstable digital currencies, betting on sports, betting on conspiracy theories and government coups and when the grid will go down. The girls are upending all the progress our mothers made, demanding lower hem lengths and mandatory home economics courses.”

If “the spirit of the age is paranoia and distrust at everything,” as one interlude asserts, then what of writing—of Avery's attempts to put something of this illogical system down on paper? After all, writing is a deeply earnest and even optimistic endeavor, one that is at odds with the cynicism produced by the economic conditions of art-making: A book asks the reader to submit to a story and to come through the experience changed, however subtly. Avery's ex-boyfriend tells her, “You're actually a proficient writer. You could be Mary Gaitskill if you weren't too embarrassed to be seen trying at anything.” Avery does seem allergic to trying hard, to taking herself seriously, to opening herself up to the possibility of failure. In the end, this tension might be the best way to understand Flat Earth: It recognizes the twin desires to say something meaningful and to do it without appearing to try. The tricky reality is that, now as ever, the true artist can't have it both ways.

First came the viral videos. Then came the shortages.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

A couple of years ago, Pokémon introduced a new monster: Poltchageist, a “Grass/Ghost type” with special abilities in “hospitality” and being “heatproof.” It is wily and homicidal; it is also matcha.

Sure—why not? Matcha, a special preparation of green tea, is already everywhere else. It's in candy and restaurant desserts and ultra-firming eye cream and Frappuccinos and a pretty foul-sounding martini. Loacker, the 100-year-old Italian company that makes those Quadratini cookies, has introduced a matcha flavor. Dunkin' sells a matcha doughnut. Thousands or possibly millions of young people on TikTok seem to have devoted their life to decanting green sludge from one vessel to another. Retail sales of matcha powder in the United States are up by 86 percent from three years ago. Matcha is outselling coffee at some cafés, including my local Blank Street, which isn't really a coffeeshop at all anymore—earlier this year, the company drenched its interiors in celadon, dropped the word coffee from its name, and began offering an ever-expanding menu of matcha drinks in baroque, hybridized flavors, such as carrot cake and “daydream.”

In 2023, the global matcha market was estimated to be $4.3 billion. That number is expected to nearly double by the end of the decade. Like most trends, this one is a synthesis of several macro-level factors, among them: caffeine anxiety, the wellness boom, rising coffee prices, the proliferation of cheap home milk frothers, and the fact that the color green looks amazing on video. Matcha has appeared, as if out of nowhere, to brute-force its way into the mainstream American palate.

Except—matcha does not come from nowhere. It comes from Japan, where it has, for centuries, been used ceremonially, and where supply challenges are now colliding with world-historic demand. For hundreds of years, matcha has been a specialized product, one that is, by definition, laborious to produce: Camellia sinensis thrives in subtropical, rainy climates. The best, sweetest matcha—the matcha that people who know matcha drink—comes from plants grown in the shade, after which their two youngest leaves are picked (by hand, only at the very beginning of the season) and then steamed, de-stemmed, deveined, dried, and ground between granite. As an agricultural product, it is much more like wine than like, say, corn. But climate change is shrinking the land that C. sinensis can grow on, and the farmers who have traditionally cultivated it are getting older, and they lack willing successors for the demanding work.

And so, as interest spikes, things are getting weird. From 2024 to 2025, the average price in Kyoto for first-flush tencha, the whole leaves used to make matcha, nearly tripled. Farmers outside Japan—in China and South Korea, for example—are frantically cultivating tencha, hoping to catch the wave. Manufacturers are taking advantage of the market's lack of regulation and are selling ground-up green tea as matcha. Joseph Sorensen, the chair of UC Davis's Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures and the acting director of the university's Global Tea Institute, estimates that 90 percent of the powdered matcha on store shelves isn't technically matcha at all. “Unauthorized resellers” are scalping marked-up matcha powder on social media as if it were Bad Bunny tickets. Counterfeiters are—allegedly!—selling colored powder and hoping no one notices. Kelly Shaw, who leads marketing for the U.K. matcha brand PerfectTed, told me that her company has seen others bulk ordering its matcha on Amazon and reselling it at competing local shops.

Like Poltchageist, PerfectTed is a product of its time. Quite literally: It became popular in 2023, after two of its co-founders, Marisa Poster and Teddie Levenfiche, went on Dragons' Den, the United Kingdom's version of Shark Tank, when they were both 25. There, they sold matcha using the language of utility and the logic of enterprise: Matcha, Poster told the cameras, evoked a venerable ritual, but more important, it was a “massive opportunity in the natural-energy-drink sector.” Poster had learned of matcha while trying to manage her ADHD and anxiety as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania. She was using energy drinks and coffee to stay awake while studying but was constantly crashing. Matcha—which contains less caffeine than coffee does but more than other green tea does, as well as an amino acid said to aid focus—offered her a cleaner buzz.

All five Dragons fought to give Levenfiche and Poster their money. PerfectTed is now the U.K.'s fastest-growing retail brand across all sectors; according to Shaw, it alone imports 25 percent of Japan's matcha supply. In addition to its flagship product, an energy drink, the company sells canned matcha lattes, Nespresso-compatible matcha pods, and powdered, sometimes flavored matcha. Its website features photographs of sporty people in green outfits and ad copy suggesting that matcha is not only better caffeine but more interesting caffeine: One graphic juxtaposes an intoxicatingly swirly jade-green matcha latte with a generic paper coffee cup, the latter stamped with BORING in red, like a voided check.

The traditional Japanese matcha ceremony involves patience, special equipment, and zero high-fructose corn syrup. Most of the new-wave matcha companies courting customers outside Japan are offering something else entirely, by admission and design. “I think if it remained in a tea ceremony and required a cha-wan and a whisk, it wouldn't have become as popular as it has,” Shaw told me, gently, using the Japanese word for the special vessel in which matcha is traditionally brewed.

But even as these companies reject historical authenticity, they employ it as a selling point: PerfectTed, like many, many others, calls its powdered matcha “ceremonial grade,” a newly popular designation that is unregulated and completely meaningless. Matcha, in these companies' tellings, presents an ancient and vaguely spiritual answer to the trials of modern life—an easy-to-consume, crash-free caffeine hit to get you through a looming deadline, a monk-approved solution to a problem that a monk would never have. Like miso, tahini, gochujang, and so many other global foods that have become trendy in this context-collapsed, free-associative, flavormaxxed culinary era, matcha is no longer really a fully formed cultural product with a heritage to be fidelitous to. Rather, it is a collection of appealing attributes, ready to be stripped for parts and endlessly remixed—a novel flavor, a functional ingredient, a component, a value proposition, a brand.

Matcha's shift from niche commodity with sacred associations to international celebrity is not, in Sorensen's view, wholly negative, as long as people don't “pretend that they're participating in Japanese culture by having a Starbucks latte.” The matcha ceremony's practitioners take it seriously, and they're watching it get more expensive—but, he told me, this is a “pretty specialized group of enthusiasts.” To the degree that the teenagers buying my local Blank Street out of carrot-cake matcha lattes are driving up the price of a pillar of Japanese life, we're talking about something that's closer to golf clubs than to communion wafers. And besides, Sorensen reminded me, much of the “matcha” flavor finding its way to the mass market isn't actually matcha. “It's pretty much the difference between something that is strawberry flavored,” he said, “and actual strawberries.” Food products can experience shortages, but flavors are a basically infinite resource, at least in food science's modern era.

Sorensen and others are less worried about the rise in demand than they are about what comes after it. Matcha plants require three to five years to mature. Even if farmers were to have the arable land and the human labor to plant all the plants that the world wants right now, the world, at some point, is likely to stop wanting so much of it. Telegenic 20-somethings in the United States can get excited about a new way to stay focused or go viral, and almost immediately, a massive agri-industrial mechanism halfway around the world will shudder to life to satisfy them—a population that barely knows such a mechanism exists and that will probably move on soon anyway. Food, especially food that comes from plants, is slow. Trends, especially trends that come from the internet, are not.

A Heritage insider alleging “openly misogynistic and racist” conduct shines a light on the right's inner workings.

For the past several weeks, the American conservative movement has been publicly embroiled in a bitter, existential conflict between factions seeking to win control of its future. And after speaking with a number of people on the right, including a well-placed source who describes seeing some ugly events at the Heritage Foundation, one of the most influential think tanks in the conservative movement, I've come to think this is not a one-off struggle.

Rather, it's a harbinger of the post-Trump future to come.

The Fort Sumter moment of this particular civil war came in late October, when Tucker Carlson — arguably the MAGA right's most influential journalist — hosted Nick Fuentes, a gutter antisemite with a large online following, on his podcast for a friendly interview. The subsequent attacks on Carlson pulled in his ally Kevin Roberts, Heritage's president, who vehemently defended Carlson and his decision to platform Fuentes from the “venomous coalition” on the right attacking him.

Then the backlash began in earnest, with some Heritage scholars and even Republican senators speaking out publicly. Chris DeMuth, one of Heritage's most prominent recent hires, quit in protest. In a November staff meeting, video of which leaked to the press, more than one staff member told Roberts to his face that they expected him to resign.

And the conflict is escalating well beyond Heritage.

In early November, two board members of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute — the oldest right-wing campus organization in America — resigned in protest over what they saw as an unacceptable drift toward Carlson-style politics. Afterward, the two men published a letter calling on conservatives to “choose to fight on the side of William F. Buckley, Jr. and give no corner to those preaching white supremacy, antisemitism, eugenics, and bigotry.”

When you hear this rhetoric, you may think that this is a simple struggle between the honorable conservative old guard and the insurgent online right. And yet, there is an obvious problem with this framework: The remaining “old guard” on the right today is almost uniformly pro-Trump. Those Buckleyite conservatives who opposed him, warning of precisely the kind of degradation we're seeing today, have functionally left the movement; their institutions-in-exile, like The Bulwark, now make up the right flank of American liberalism.

What is happening now, then, is less about preserving the genteel Buckley-and-Reagan right (which itself was always more dependent on extremists than many conservatives are willing to admit). Rather, it is about defining what comes next — or, more precisely, what comes next after Trump. And the leaders of right-wing institutions no longer have the power to police their own and say, “We will go this far, but no farther.”

The result is that the right is going through its own version of the left's 2020, when ideas from its most radical factions broke containment and became debated in the traditional halls of power. Only, instead of police abolition and “white fragility,” the ideas in question are pushing women out of the workplace and executing “perfidious Jews.”

Given the anti-Roberts furor among some of Heritage's staff, you might think that the organization is a bastion of principled conservatism reflecting on its recent choices. But one Heritage insider I spoke to painted a different, and more worrying, picture of its internal culture.

This person is quite familiar with both Roberts and Heritage's upper echelons; were I to publish their name, there is a very real chance their career would be over. But nonetheless, they felt the need to speak out, so we're not disclosing their name in order to protect them from retaliation.

The source had only kind words for Kevin Roberts as a person — “nothing but a gentleman” — and professed deep appreciation for the organization Roberts leads and its importance for the American right.

“If I didn't care about Heritage,” they said, “I would not be doing this at all.”

But they were deeply alarmed at what had happened to the place, warning of extremist “counter-culture thinking [that] has seeped in” among a portion (though not all) of the staff. While the source believes leadership does not share these staffers' politics, they believe it has created a climate of permissiveness — allowing a “rot” to set in.

“My message to Kevin [has been that] I know that you don't believe these things that have been going around the building,” the source said. “But he never had the courage to disavow it, to nip it in the bud when he could have.”

To substantiate their claims, the source described witnessing several instances of Heritage personnel “being openly misogynistic and racist” in their presence. These include Heritage staff using racially derogatory language about a Black employee behind their back and referring to the 19th Amendment (which granted women the right to vote) as the cause of American society's downfall.

But perhaps their most striking recollection was a conversation with a donor who, during a discussion about liberal allegations of racism against the right, admitted to actually holding racist views — but keeping them a secret in public.

Heritage, for its part, describes the claims as “defamatory” — asserting that “Heritage has zero tolerance for racism” and threatening Vox with legal action.

“We're used to Leftist lunatics spewing lies about conservatives, so it's unsurprising that the so-called source is laundering this gossip through a far-Left outlet like Vox,” the organization said in its statement.

Yet there are several independent reasons to believe that the source's claims of “rot” are credible.

First, evidence of toleration for hidden bigotry can be seen in Heritage's treatment of E.J. Antoni, its current chief economist.

Earlier this year, after the Trump administration nominated Antoni to be the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, CNN uncovered damning evidence that Antoni had maintained an anonymous Twitter account that posted “sexually degrading attacks on Kamala Harris [and] derogatory remarks about gay people.” The White House withdrew Antoni's nomination after the article's publication.

Yet Antoni maintained his position at Heritage. He is currently listed on its website as “the Chief Economist, and Richard Aster Fellow, in The Heritage Foundation's Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget,” and last published an article on Heritage's website under that title on November 4 (well over a month after his withdrawal).

Second, there is public evidence of Heritage hires engaging in some of the specific conduct alleged by the source. In 2023, Heritage brought on John McEntee — a key Trump ally who worked on personnel issues — to help construct Project 2025's database of staffers for a future GOP administration. The next year, McEntee publicly “joked” about revoking women's right to vote in a post on X.

Third, other Heritage insiders have made related complaints after Roberts's public defense of Carlson. Last Friday, professor Adam Mossoff — a visiting fellow at Heritage — released a letter of resignation addressed to Roberts in which Mossoff accuses him of tolerating rising extremism in the right's ranks.

“Antisemitism is just the tip of the spear of a collectivist and nihilist ideology that seeks the destruction of Western Civilization. Your videos and statements have made it clear that we embrace as ‘friends' those who embrace and proselytize these evil ideas under the guise of a big tent on the right in which self-proclaimed conservatives can have friendly and cheery conversations with modern Nazis,” Mossoff wrote.

“It is one thing for you to make this choice as an individual, but you have made this choice for the Heritage Foundation.”

For all its notable issues, it is important not to treat Heritage in isolation. When you spend enough time talking with people on the broader right, it becomes clear that the line between the hard right and the mainstream has long been more porous than many think. It is quite common for someone to hold some provocative beliefs, especially on issues of identity and bigotry, that they do not wish to share publicly.

It is unusual — but not unheard of — for such a person to openly identify their own views as “racist” or “sexist.” What's more common is a sense that certain “truths” are unsayable in public, because anyone who offered them would risk professional or personal consequences from a mainstream in hock to leftist PC or “woke” sentiments.

What exactly those “unsayable truths” are is a subject on which people across the right disagree among themselves. Take race, for example: There is a deep divide between those who blame persistent inequalities on alleged deficiencies in Black culture and those who assert that Black genetics mean they (as a group) are more likely to have low IQs.

The point is not that all conservatives hold one of those two views on the causes of racial inequality, or any other similar issue. The American right is a broad and heterogeneous movement, many of whom would reject both of the above views in private and in public.

Rather, the point is that these are normalized debates inside broader conservative spaces: the sorts of things that people employed at places like Heritage feel they can argue with each other about in safe spaces. For this reason, a real slice of the right's internal dialogue — not close to all of it, but certainly a meaningful part — consists of debating the merits of ideas that outsiders might reasonably describe as bigoted.

Over the course of the Trump era, these internal debates have breached containment: ideas once unsayable publicly becoming things that influential voices on the right freely and openly discuss. As recently as 2013, theorizing about the inherently lower IQ of Latino immigrants would get you fired from Heritage; today, such views are openly aired in the public debate. The president himself has talked about the “bad genes” of murderous undocumented immigrants.

Many right-wingers acknowledge that the dam is breaking. In a recent essay, writer Helen Andrews — who has a history of pushing boundaries on race — dubiously argued that many of the ills of the modern American workplace can be blamed on women's mass participation in it. Near its conclusion, Andrews describes feeling trepidation about airing her true views:

In September, I gave a speech at the National Conservatism conference along the lines of the essay above. I was apprehensive about putting forward the Great Feminization thesis in such a public forum. It is still controversial, even in conservative circles, to say that there are too many women in a given field or that women in large numbers can transform institutions beyond recognition in ways that make them cease to function well. I made sure to express my argument in the most neutral way possible. To my surprise, the response was overwhelming. Within a few weeks, the video of the speech had gotten over 100,000 views on YouTube and become one of the most viewed speeches in the history of the National Conservatism conference.

You can see, in Andrews's comment, exactly the private-conversation-going-public effect that I'm describing. Views that she once aired privately in conservative circles, controversial even there, are now getting positive attention in public. Just recently, Andrews appeared on the New York Times's Interesting Times podcast to make her case — in an episode initially titled “Did Women Ruin the Workplace?”

So far, I've deliberately avoided talking about the main subject of the right's current civil war: the role of Jewish people in American politics and society. That's because the contours of the right's internal discussion of that issue are qualitatively different from what they are on race or gender.

Among conservatives, it's widely recognized that the movement's youth are, in general, more radical than their elders. My Heritage insider source, for example, warned that “some of the younger staff members [are] playing around with some really dangerous ideas I thought were going to lead to disaster, and we're kind of living through that now.”

Sometimes the young and old right are in directional agreement, even if they disagree vehemently on specifics. Younger conservatives might indulge in provocations — like calling for the repeal of the 19th Amendment granting women the vote — that go too far for older conservatives, but they nonetheless express a shared dislike for feminism. The difference here is more about degree than kind.

Yet on Jews, the two generations face a genuine divergence in orientation. The older guard on the right is not only staunchly pro-Israel, but also more likely to see Jews as a kind of “model minority”: proof that a minority group can overcome discrimination through grit and hard work rather than government handouts. The youth cadres, by contrast, are instinctively skeptical of US commitments to foreign states and deeply suspicious of the (mostly liberal) Jewish community's influence on American politics.

This generational divide, born out by the best survey data on antisemitic attitudes, was vividly on display at the leaked Heritage meeting. While the staff excoriating Roberts skewed old, the ones who defended him (and the pro-Tucker video) seemed to be disproportionately young. Their ranks included Evan Myers, a speechwriter for Roberts, who claimed that a proposal for the organization to host an apologetic Shabbat dinner would amount to an insidious form of discrimination against Christians like him.

Any discussion about generational divides risks gross generalization. So I want to be clear: It's not that all, or even most, young Republican operatives are Fuentes-style antisemites. But many of them — far more than outsiders would likely believe — sure sound like it.

The most alarming estimate, offered repeatedly by social conservative pundit Rod Dreher, is that 30 to 40 percent of Gen Z Republicans in DC have views like Fuentes's. There is no real statistical basis for this estimate, and Dreher is known for a certain level of hysteria: He recently wrote that a chair breaking during a visit to Rome could be a personal warning to him from Satan.

But the value of the number is less as a precise estimate than it is as a reflection of the level of concern about the youth among conservatives of Dreher's generation. They feel like large numbers of young conservatives do not share their values when it comes to Jews and Israel, and that the rise of people like Fuentes and Carlson represents an existential threat to the movement as they understand it — much more so than race-and-IQ theorizing or Andrews-style reactionary gender politics.

“For Republicans, the donors and the…movement rank-and-file have been aligned on most issues. So we haven't seen this kind of tension before, not in recent memory,” says David Austin Walsh, a historian of conservatism at the University of Virginia.

In the past, such a fraught conversation might be the sort of thing that could be cordoned off into private right-only spaces. But now, under conditions where the right's external and internal conversations are merging, the fights invariably spill out into the open. And when it's divisive enough, as the subject of antisemitism is, a public disagreement can quickly turn into a civil war.

There are many reasons why the right's internal conversation has gone public. Some of the biggest ones are technological: Social media has demolished gatekeepers of all kinds, and the rise of direct online payment models has made it so people like Carlson can make a handsome living in ways that the right's traditional elite have no ability to shut off.

But what's important now is less why this is happening than what it means for the movement's future. And on that front, I think one of the most revealing conversations I had came with a formerly canceled conservative columnist named Jack Hunter.

In the late '90s and early 2000s, Hunter was a kind of proto-Fuentes. He hosted a South Carolina radio show under the moniker “the Southern Avenger,” a shock-jock persona who wore a Mexican-luchador style mask with a Confederate flag on it.

The Southern Avenger endorsed Lincoln's assassination, claiming to raise a toast every year on John Wilkes Booth's birthday. He mooted modern-day Southern secessionism and called on someone to “whip” the Black director Spike Lee. He said that “a non-white-majority America would simply cease to be America for reasons that are as numerous as they are obvious.”

As he got older, Hunter moved away from this racism — turning instead to a more principled kind of libertarianism and becoming an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY). But after Paul hired Hunter as his social media director in 2012, he became a visible target for their internal GOP enemies.

In 2013, a reporter from the Washington Free Beacon — a neoconservative outlet opposed to Paul and Hunter's foreign policy views — dug up evidence of Hunter's neo-Confederate past. Though Hunter apologized, the controversy was too much. He resigned from Paul's office two weeks after the story broke.

In the years following the controversy, Hunter has repeatedly disavowed the Southern Avenger's beliefs and built a career as a libertarian writer advocating for a non-interventionist foreign policy. People I trust say Hunter is sincere in his conversion, and after speaking to him for nearly an hour this week, I agree. When I asked him what he thought about Fuentes, he was unequivocal: “I think he's awful,” Hunter said, describing the Groyper king as a “dickhead” for good measure.

And yet, when I asked about Roberts and Carlson's behavior, Hunter took their side. He thinks Carlson was right to platform Fuentes, and that Roberts was right to defend Carlson.

Part of this is personal: Carlson had been kind to Hunter in the past, and he's a loyal guy. Part of this is that he sees Carlson's actions differently, not as an attempt to mainstream Fuentes but, rather, to win his viewers.

But Hunter's biggest motivation, the one he came back to the most in our conversation, was strategic. Hunter sees the current fight not through the lens of bigotry-versus-principle, but rather as factional infighting over US-Israel policy.

At the moment, the right's position on Israel and US foreign policy more broadly is up for grabs in a way that it hasn't been in the modern era. Hunter sees people like Roberts and Carlson as trying to move it in a saner direction — away from an unquestioning lockstep alliance and toward the kind of relationship that won't implicate the US in what Hunter describes as a “genocide” against Palestinians.

“People think the world is ending. I think it's healthy as hell,” he tells me. “If you were going to shake America, and particularly the American right, from this Israel obsession…it was always going to look like this stateside.”

His willingness to countenance some ugliness among allies appears, in part, to be a lesson of his own cancellation in 2013. That episode, he believed, stood as proof that the right's interventionists will resort to character assassination against their internal enemies. In this kind of war, he argues, the gloves need to come off.

“They have no moral scruples about kicking the shit out of anybody who's anti-war, especially on the right,” he tells me. “We have a chance to do the same to them. I'm a Christian, I believe in forgiveness, but there's a special exception carved out for those people.”

Hunter's comments point to the crucial subtext behind so much of the right's newly public fights: the looming factional conflict over what the GOP will stand for after Trump leaves office.

Anyone with eyes can see that Donald Trump is the figure currently holding a fractious right together. There are many different sub-factions inside the GOP, many of which disagree with each other viciously. But Trump's ideological incoherence, together with his charismatic cult of personality, allows him to unify them under the banner of fighting the left.

But now, with the imminent prospect of his departure from office looming, the question of what the post-Trump conservative movement stands for is becoming more urgent. And while there is no plausible vehicle for a return to the pre-MAGA era, there are plenty of policy issues within the right — ranging from tariffs to Israel — where there is no consensus and the future remains uncertain. That means that party actors view each individual spat not just through the lens of principle, but also factional interest going forward.

So it's not just that taboos over private debates on the right are breaking down. It's that these newly public debates over offensive topics are becoming a critical part of the right's post-Trump struggle for power. In such a brawl, battle lines are not just determined by moral sensibilities but also by raw power politics. Each side condemns the offensive speech of their enemies, while giving the excesses of their friends a pass.

It's hard to say how any of this will shake out at present. But one person is shaping up to be a key figure: Vice President JD Vance.

Vance is, by most accounts, the current favorite to win the GOP nomination in 2028. But more than that, he's the political avatar for the right flank of Very Online Conservatism. Previously defining himself as a “postliberal” opposed to the American “regime,” he has more recently been defending Republican operatives who got caught privately texting things like “I love Hitler.”

You'd think this would make him the natural candidate for the Fuentes faction. And indeed, he is close with both Roberts and Carlson, the latter of whom reportedly played an instrumental role in Vance's selection as vice president.

Yet at the same time, Fuentes regularly rails against Vance — with one of his principal gripes being that Vance's wife, Usha, is of Indian descent. Perhaps for this reason, many on the older right believe they can win Vance to their side. Dreher, among others, has both privately and publicly pleaded with the vice president to intervene to police the right's boundaries.

There is no option to stay neutral here for Vance. Amid these pleas, saying nothing would send a clear message that he won't rein in Carlson or Roberts's flirtation with Fuentes. Whatever decision he makes, it appears, will be a defining one: It will help decide not only which factions are currently ascendant in Washington, but also whether the right's top leadership will even attempt to shove some of its newly public discourse back into the conservative closet.

Trump is starting to make Latino Republicans uneasy.

There's an open question hanging over both parties when it comes to Latino voters right now: How should they talk about the second Trump administration's ongoing campaign of mass deportations?

Setting aside the moral and humanitarian issues, this is an important, and curious, political debate. On the Democratic side, that's over how to frame Trump's operations: as overreach and excessive — of going beyond what he promised to his recent converts and targeting longtime, law-abiding residents and sweeping up citizens through racial profiling — or to focus on other issues, like the economy.

On the Republican side, it's over whether to continue down the current path or pull back from excessive shows of force, the elimination of special migrant protections, and an all-encompassing approach.

For now, there isn't consensus over any of this or even whether immigration is even an important or decisive issue for these voters. But both sides will still be spending the next few months looking at public opinion, primary voting, protests or popular backlash, and the campaign trail to get a sense of what approach might work.

What's clear for now is that Trump 2024 coalition is in real peril — largely because of defecting Latino voters.

That's why I decided to take a look at what the data and research we have at this moment suggests and try to lay out the nuances of how Republican-voting Latinos are feeling right now. Those perspectives and opinions matter. They may determine the durability of both the GOP's 2024 edge and Democrats' gradual erosion of support while also saying something larger about how these voters view themselves in the American political system.

Entering 2025, the new line of conventional wisdom about why Republican Latinos were swelling the ranks was two-fold: They were angry at the Biden-era Democratic Party's management of the economy, and they were growing more tolerant of harsher immigration policy.

Polls, focus groups, and individual interviews with these voters all seemed to point in the same direction: a rightward shift among primarily working-class Latino voters, driven by a combination of economic anxiety and discontent with aspects of social liberalism that clashed with their more traditionalist views. What surveys suggested — and what the 2024 election confirmed — was that these voters trusted Trump to fix the economy, secure the border, and enact deportations on a mass scale. In many ways, their views were beginning to align more with those of white working-class voters, and they voted in 2024 accordingly.

Yet, just as this new conventional wisdom was beginning to settle, election results this year in New Jersey and Virginia suggested that the narrative about Latino voters — especially working-class ones with more conservative social views — had gone further than the voters themselves. Latinos shifted back to Democratic candidates, with the Democratic candidates in both states regaining much — but not all — of the ground among Latino voters that the party had lost in 2024.

Unsurprisingly, the conventional wisdom has quickly adjusted. Now, the narrative is that Trump and Republicans misinterpreted the support they'd won among Latinos in 2024, mistaking a vote against the status quo regarding prices and the border as a more fulsome endorsement of the entire MAGA agenda. Simply put, these voters wanted lower prices and a stronger economy, and, as my colleague Andrew Prokop has noted, Trump has signally failed to deliver on this fundamental promise.

The research and data we have available right now backs up this interpretation. A new analysis by the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Initiative, for example, finds that Latino Republican voters in California are increasingly ambivalent about Trump's presidency.

Analyzing statewide polling from the summer, the Initiative found that Latino Republicans are more likely than white or Asian GOP voters to oppose deporting longtime residents, more likely to support due process protections for potential deportees, and more skeptical of actions by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Indeed, according to the Initiative, when Latino Republicans are confronted with the way the Trump administration is handling raids, due process, and the question of birthright citizenship, they appear to be more persuadable than Republican voters in general.

The report's authors suggest some recent enforcement actions are to blame. “Recent media depictions of ICE calvaries and gunmen entering family spaces, like MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, or picking up parents at school sites,” they wrote, “has felt like a step too far for some Republican voters.

That said, it still remains unclear just how much these changing views will translate to a change in voting patterns. Being unhappy with Trump's stewardship is one thing; being unhappy enough with Trump's stewardship to vote against the Republican Party, however, is something else. Other issues — such as the economy or social conservatism — could end up being more important to these voters, as was the case in 2024.

Polls conducted by the Latino firm BSP Research in September and October, for example, all show similar results in California and in battleground states of Republicans feeling uneasy about enforcement actions. But in the September poll, only 8 percent of respondents cited “protections for immigrants already here” as a top issue, and said economic concerns, homelessness and crime, and the border were more important.

Similarly, a national poll from October found that, while these voters were wary of mass deportation's effect on their communities, they nevertheless still supported mass deportations and stricter border policies.

It all paints a pretty muddled picture of just how far Latino Republicans are willing to bend or change on their politics when confronted with Trump's agenda.

“One in three Republican Latinos told us they believe that their community is safer because dangerous criminals have been deported,” Anais X. Lopez, a pollster and analyst at BSP Research, told me. “So, there are some Republican voters who are getting what they wanted.”

But, she emphasized that this trend still obscures the predominant issue in these voters' minds: prices, affordability, and the economy. Last year, “they were saying, ‘You know what? If we're going to vote for him, regardless of whether they agree with this immigration policy or not, if I'm going to vote for him, it's because I'm struggling economically.' Well, things haven't gotten better in one sense, and they also haven't gotten better in any other sense for them.”

“There's no doubt in my mind that Latino Republicans are going to be more sensitive to Trump's immigration policy. They are. But there's also no doubt in my mind that this is at best, a very, very distant second in motivating partisan voting behavior,” Mike Madrid, a California Republican analyst and former California GOP political director, told me about this tension in voters' minds. “If the economy were good, no one would give a shit about immigration. You would not be seeing big changes in voting behavior. These voters are asking for the economy to be resolved, and if the economy were being resolved, there might still be variations in how these voters approve of enforcement, but it wouldn't be changing their voting behavior.”

To Madrid and Lopez, this is the unresolved question facing American politics as it heads into another high-stakes midterm election. Is fear and frustration over mass deportation going to combine with economic dissatisfaction to create a larger and stronger swing against Republicans? And if Trump and the GOP do manage to make progress on inflation, affordability, and wage growth, would that give Trump and the administration more leeway to carry out its draconian agenda?

Lopez argues that, at this point, it might be too late for Republicans to reverse those negative attitudes. Fixing the economy wouldn't necessarily reverse the sense of deception that some Trump-voting Latinos are feeling. Madrid, however, suggests there's still persuasion possible there, which suggests to Democrats that they should still prioritize economic messaging.

“Yes, there is concern, there is fear, but overwhelmingly, we're in an economic crisis that affects 100 percent of Latinos,” Madrid told me. “I don't doubt that there's a very strong salience for those that are closer to the immigrant experience. That's true of almost every issue, but especially now, the overwhelming number of Latino voters are US born and growing further into the generational cycle that matters in the outcome of these results, and it doesn't mean we're not sensitive to it, but it also means we're not lying awake at night, worried about ICE raids. We're lying awake because we don't have money for rent on Friday. What are we going to do?”

Today's sports gambling looks nothing like the sports betting of the past.

Another week, another sports betting scandal.

It's never been this easy for a player to fix the outcome of a bet. The onset of proposition or “prop” bets, in which gamblers can place wagers on specific outcomes in a game, has opened a Pandora's box for athletic integrity. This month, the NCAA announced that a ring of college athletes had manipulated their performance in games to aid bettors and permanently revoked their eligibility. In October, the NBA faced its own seismic gambling indictments, more alleged prop rigging, complete with connections to the mafia. Now, the MLB is under scrutiny for a betting scandal of its own, with pitchers being accused of taking bribes in exchange for rigging pitches during a game.

Eight years after the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had banned most states from legalizing sports betting, sports betting can feel like it's embedded into every aspect of American sports culture. From bars to live broadcasts, online betting is changing how we consume sports. This is the age of the betting scandal — and the main suspect is that increasingly popular way to bet on games: prop bets.

“It's one of the defining traits of this legal online sports betting era,” Danny Funt, sportswriter and author of the upcoming book Everybody Loses: The Tumultuous Rise of American Sports Gambling, told Today, Explained guest host Astead Herndon. “One player can very easily influence the outcome of one of these prop bets. It's literally about the play of a specific person, sometimes on a specific play.”

As scandals accumulate, leagues are cracking down. This week, the NFL sent a memo to team officials saying that gambling scandals in other sports have led the league to formulate policies to limit or prohibit prop bets in the NFL. The MLB announced that sportsbooks will establish a nationwide $200 betting limit on baseball wagers centered on individual pitches, in order to make them less susceptible to fixing.

Funt spoke with Herndon about the recent betting scandals, the rise of prop bets, and how they're changing sports culture in America. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Can you give people a sense of just how granular some of these prop bets might get? 

It's ridiculous. What's the speed of the next pitch? Will the runner on first try to steal second? Will this inning generate a run? Will a possession in football and then a score, a punt, or a turnover?

The idea is every second you're watching and inevitably watching while on your phone, let's give you something to bet on. In the past, you used to bet on who's going to win or who's going to win against the point spread. Now, the majority of people bet these prop bets on all sorts of kind of side propositions within a game like the speed of pitches and minutiae like that.

How have these prop bets popped up in the recent scandals in the MLB and NBA?

This same prosecutor's office in New York City arrested Terry Rozier, who's a guard on the Miami Heat. And they arrested Chauncey Billups, who was the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.

Rozier was accused of feeding inside information to a close friend and some gamblers in their orbit and then removing himself from a game, saying he was injured because they had bet on the unders on his prop bets. So if I'm going to say Terry Rozier will score a certain number of points and then 10 minutes into the game, he removes himself. There was a good chance those bets were not going to go over. They bet the under a huge amount of money and allegedly divvied up the profits at Rogier's house after one of these games. He was arrested, maintains his innocence,

So it seems as if a lot of scandals are deriving from these prop bets because of the individual impact that these players can have. Is this kind of betting new?

In the past, even if betting has always existed in Nevada or through your neighborhood bookie or whatever, typically that was done in person, often before games started. Now more than 90 percent of bets are placed online legally.

A lot of these are smartphone apps, which enable betting during games on these real-time bets. It creates so much opportunity for manipulation and this volume of betting where there are literally thousands of prop bets available for many major sports, every game, absolutely did not exist just several years ago. You could not bet tens of thousands of dollars on a fringe bench player to get a certain number of rebounds. That's something new.

How much betting is happening on these prop bets during an individual game?

Americans wager about $150 billion legally every year. About 30 percent of the money wagered is on props or combinations of props that form parlay. That generates 60 percent of the revenue. More than half of the money generated is coming from this type of betting.

This opens the door for all sorts of corruption. Will the sports books be inclined to rein it in? I doubt it because it's their biggest moneymaker these days. The thing that's so enticing to these companies about offering thousands and thousands of live micro-bets during the game is you might bet 30 bucks pregame, but you might bet 10 bucks five or 10 times on these micro bets. Suddenly, you've bet way more than you would have if you were just doing it beforehand. So that's why it's a phenomenal business for them.

It's also especially addictive because the more frenzied and relentless the bedding, the easier it is to feed that kind of compulsive instinct. Because if I'm betting every 10 seconds versus every two hours, it's a very different experience.

Why exactly are these athletes, particularly active athletes, getting involved in these bets? We're talking about multimillionaires.

That was literally one of the arguments that the leagues and their gambling operator partners assured the public when they were pushing for legalization was “don't worry, today's athletes are too wealthy to be corrupted.” They wouldn't throw it all away to gamble.

Obviously, you could look in sports, you could look on Wall Street, whatever: Being rich doesn't immunize you from being greedy or being foolish. That's one thing. Hyper-competitive athletes may also be more susceptible to gambling addiction than the general population.

A ton of athletes gamble, and some of them get carried away. This idea that you make however many millions of dollars, so you're not going to make a bad decision is really falling apart as we see these scandals unfold.

Is there any concern that the leagues have had about the ways that their close marriage to the sports betting industry has changed the viewing experience or changed the fan experience?

The commissioners of major sports warned decade after decade that all this stuff would happen. And then the people in power saw the dollar signs and changed their stance. But one of the things they really banged the drum on was that a fixation on betting cheapens or degrades your relationship with sports.

It's one thing if you're a diehard Chicago Bulls fan. It's another thing if you go to a game and you're just waiting for someone to get two steals. And sometimes nowadays, you can feel this in an arena or a stadium. You'll hear like a groan or a cheer go out when someone grabs a rebound. And it's like, what's the big deal? What was that all about? It's because they covered their prop betting line. So that stuff is interesting in how it's changing the nature of fandom.

It also has a really ugly side, where of course sports fans can be overly intense and get crazed about the teams they're rooting for, but we're seeing a level of harassment and threats sent toward athletes that crosses a line. There have been stories of people being stalked at their team hotel or at their home. The manager of the San Diego Padres just resigned, and he said part of why he did it was I'm so tired of getting death threats from gamblers. So this is something that I think is gonna reach a boiling point.

What are people trying to do about prop betting? Are there any pushes to change the law or to roll back any of this?

One of the leading forces on that is the NCAA. They really dragged their feet to come around on legalization. They were often the most adamant that this would be bad for sports. And for a while now, they've been saying that states should ban bets on individual player props. Not only does it open the door for all sorts of manipulation and the temptation for them to gamble, it heightens that microscope that they're under and leads to a lot of really ugly harassment that we were just talking about.

So some states have gone ahead and banned individual player props on college sports. The NCAA is pushing for all states to do that. Major League Baseball, in response to these arrests, reached an agreement with a bunch of sportsbooks that they won't take bets exceeding $200 on individual pitches. At least from a fixing standpoint, it doesn't make it as easy to make a boatload of money if you're fixing certain pitches.

It's time to rethink a key pillar of the American dream.

Jerusalem Demsas, editor-in-chief of The Argument, has a hot take when it comes to our housing woes: “Homeownership is overrated.”

That's a particularly bold perspective when you take into account that 70 percent of Americans think owning a home is a key part of achieving the American dream. Demsas argues that our homeownership society is not all it's cracked up to be, and that there can be a real joy in renting.

“I'm a renter and I love being a renter,” she said. “I love being able to move when I want to move. I love not feeling like it's my responsibility to make sure the roof is okay and make sure the fridge isn't going to break. A house is a massive asset. Even if you're an entry-level home buyer, that's a lot of money. There are a lot of people who benefit from it, and who enjoy getting to have the freedom of renovating their home and making it exactly how they want it. But I think that we overhype the financial benefits way too much.”

On the latest episode to Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast, we dig into that hype, why homeownership isn't for everyone, and why the dream of owning a home is so prominent in the American imagination to begin with. Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Demsas, edited for length and clarity.

You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

What are the financial benefits that we're told it has and what are the realities?

There are basically two financial benefits we're told about. One is the forced savings mechanism. If you're going to pay for shelter in some way, it's either going to be rent or a mortgage. You're going to be forced to save it into a house where that value eventually is yours at the end of the day, versus giving it to a landlord and then you never see that money again, which is obviously true. But the second is that the return on that investment is going to be great, and that's just not guaranteed at all. There are so many things that have to happen for the return on your investment in a house to be worth it.

First, you have to be able to hold onto that house through bad times, and that's really difficult. A lot of people — like in the Great Recession for instance, or when you lose a job, you have a medical emergency, or you have to move because your parents are sick — whatever it is, have to sell their house at a time that's not financially opportune for them. So you're selling at a time when maybe interest rates are really high, you're giving up a low interest rate, or selling at a lower price maybe than you bought for it, or you're not even making that much money on top of what you were able to sell for it.

Secondly, owning a home is often more expensive than renting. So all that extra money that you could use to invest in the stock market, invest in other kinds of large index funds, that kind of investment is almost guaranteed to be higher than what you're going to get from investing in your house.

How did we get to this point where buying a home is considered the ultimate way to build wealth?

I want to say that I don't want to disparage people who are excited to own a home. I think a lot of people feel this way. My father is very excited to own a house. I can understand a lot of different cultural and social and psychological reasons why owning your home and not feeling beholden to a landlord feels really important to people. I don't want to sound like that's irrelevant. If it gives you psychological value, that's great. I just don't want us to lie to ourselves about the financial aspects of it while we're doing that.

The history of this is quite psychological and it is quite political. The idea that owning a house gives you a bigger stake in your community is a very conservative idea that comes about from the sense that renters are transient, they're immigrants, they're young, they have no stake in their community. If you rent, then you're going to treat your community badly. You'll put trash on the ground, or you'll be a bad influence. A very large anti-renter attitude really gets sparked in the United States as we see high levels of immigration coming into this country — in the early 1900s is when we really start seeing that come to fruition. The ownership society becomes something people really, really care about. It becomes psychologically and legally codified in the United States that what it means to be a good upstanding citizen is that you own your house, you have this white picket fence, and you live in a place where the land is yours.

I want to get into that social aspect of it. Like you said, part of the mythos of homeownership is that you have a house and therefore you are rooted in the community.

I don't even think that that's true. I'm a renter and because I'm a renter, it means I can live in a nicer area than I could otherwise afford. The house that I'm living in, there's just absolutely no way that my husband and I could afford it if we had to buy that house. It's just absurd to even imagine that happening. What that means is I'm much closer to my friends. He is able to bike very easily to his close friends that live nearby. We're able to visit his parents very easily. I can get to my work really easily. A lot of my friends can easily access my house. A lot of people, when they have to buy a house for the first time, sacrifice on location in order to get closer to a house that they can afford at a size that they want. What that means is often, eventually, maybe later on in life, you've become very rooted, but the act of buying a home usually actually moves you out of the community that you're already living in, because that's what happens when you have to change price points.

Intellectually, I really get your case, but I think emotionally it's hard for some people to let go of that dream of owning. I think for most Americans, buying a home is a big part of what it means to be an adult and have “made it.” Beyond that financial investment, what do you think is going on there? Why is homeownership so wrapped up in our identities as Americans?

I think that homeownership was always a proxy for freedom. Similarly to car ownership and being able to drive on the open road, these things are quintessentially American: You want freedom. You want freedom from a boss, you want the ability to move around at will. All these things are really, really great.

People need economic freedom. They need access to good jobs that pay well. They need access to a government that's going to hold people accountable if they exploit tenants or workers. To me, the American dream is always freedom. We have just always pushed this through homeownership. And my rejoinder to that is that I don't think homeownership is freedom for everyone. I don't feel free at the idea of owning an asset that's that risky. I know people who are underwater on their mortgages right now in DC and don't know if they're going to have a job given the layoffs and everything that's going on. Is that freedom? No. Economic freedom is freedom. How we get there is a matter of policy and a matter of technocratic debate, but I think we should reorient ourselves towards that rather than ownership in particular.

Millennial job seekers could be getting flashbacks to their postgrad job search after the Great Recession.

The labor market is going through a Great Freeze, where employers and employees are staying put with few large-scale layoffs but little hiring. This is especially affecting new job seekers, like recent college graduates, and if you're looking for work, it's starting to feel like the sluggish recovery of the early 2010s — even if unemployment rates are still far below their post-financial-crisis highs.

""This is one of the worst times to really find a new job since the aftermath of the Great Recession,"" Sarah Foster, an economic analyst for Bankrate and the author of a new report analyzing the job market, told Business Insider. 

What's your job search been like? Reach out to this reporter to share your story at mhoff@businessinsider.com.

Back in 2021, the job market was still recovering from pandemic losses. People who still had a job had leverage to switch. Hiring slipped from 4.6% in November 2021 to 3.2% this past August, the most recent month available due to the government shutdown's impact on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' activities. Besides June 2024, Bankrate said that hiring hasn't been at this rate since 2013, when the economy was still in its slow, grinding recovery from the Great Recession.

Unemployment has been fairly low — it has inched back up to just 4.3% in August. That's the highest since 2021 and far below the Great Recession recovery period. Still, Foster said it's harder to understand the job market with this rate because both supply and demand have dropped.

""Hiring is bound to cool when the job market slows, Bankrate's analysis found,"" the new report said. ""What's unusual, though, is how sharply hiring has fallen compared to the uptick in unemployment.""

The frozen hiring rates we're seeing now are typically only seen in much weaker job markets. Foster said this kind of hiring rate has historically corresponded to unemployment of 6.8%, suggesting that companies' hiring plans are ""akin to a labor market that's still recovering from a recession.""

Foster said the US is in a ""jobless boom, so to speak, where companies are expanding profits, the stock market is doing well, the economy is growing at the fastest pace in nearly two years, but growth is not happening because companies are expanding their payrolls."" Instead, she said companies are investing in ""productivity-enhancing technologies,"" such as AI.

Some job seekers have taken matters into their own hands and are pursuing entrepreneurship instead, while others send out their job applications, hoping something will stick. Parents are watching their college graduates face rejection, some older job seekers worry about ageism, and others are taking temporary work to get by.

Entry-level hiring dropped 6% in October from a year ago, based on LinkedIn. A separate Indeed Hiring Lab report using three-month moving average data found that retail, loading and stocking, and sales had the highest shares of junior-level job postings in August, but the report said advancement opportunities can be tough in those sectors.

Foster said getting a job in today's labor market boils down to being patient, being determined, showcasing what makes you different from other job candidates, and leveraging personal connections.

""When you rely on that human factor and embrace the people that you meet throughout your career, that can hopefully help you break the noise-to-signal ratio a little bit,"" she said.

Laura Ullrich, the director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, previously told Business Insider that aspiring job switchers may need to look beyond their current sector for a new role because some are hiring more than others. She also suggested exploring part-time work or volunteer opportunities that you can add to your résumé.

""I thought a year ago the job market was difficult,"" one job seeker who was laid off in late 2023 told Business Insider. ""I think it's even more so now.""

Many people may learn about AI by playing around with ChatGPT. The superrich may learn by flying their entire family to an educational course at an Ivy League university.

In hourlong conversations, some of JPMorgan's wealthiest clients revealed how they're using AI in their personal and professional lives. Of the 111 billionaire principals, 79% said they use the technology in their personal lives, and 69% said they use it in their businesses.

Some of their use cases are to be expected: writing and research, travel planning, administrative tasks, and data analysis. Yet the ultra-rich clients, whose combined net worth tops $500 billion, also reported more niche ways they've used AI in the bank's 2025 Principal Discussions Report.

When it comes to business, one respondent said that AI had helped them avoid $100,000 in legal research. (A flurry of legal tech startups has emerged to try to strip law firms of time-consuming routine work.)

Another said they first treated AI like ""a toy"" and would use it to make customized bedtime stories for their son. The tales would, they said, always end with an ""emotional twist."" One respondent said they used AI to design a blueprint for a plane they want to build. A few of the respondents said they had flown out to Ivy League schools to take classes on AI use; some even made the courses a family affair.

For all their uses, though, some of the billionaires expressed concerns about AI's impact on society and the environment. The boom in AI data centers is threatening sustainable energy targets, and the air-pollution-related public health costs could reach $9.2 billion annually, Business Insider previously reported.

When asked about the top five risks in today's global environment, 7% said AI/machine learning, making the category a distant second to geopolitical tensions. Some said they worry about job displacement related to the technology.

Not all of the respondents have started to use AI, and some said they conduct their business communications over the phone, avoid computers, and ""rely on manual calculation or intuition."" That being said, one of the principals who said they don't use the technology acknowledged its potential and said their children use it often.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Meet the new media startups built to thrive without Google traffic","https://www.businessinsider.com/media-startups-post-google-zero-search-traffic-2025-11","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 10:05:00 GMT","

No Google, no problem.

Search traffic to many digital publishers is falling, but a new guard of media companies isn't worried.

The Bulwark is one of them. Jonathan V. Last, the top editor at the center-right news and opinion site, said search was ""at the very, very bottom"" of his publication's growth drivers. The Bulwark, which launched in 2018, has become a prominent publisher on Substack and YouTube by leveraging anti-Trump sentiment among Republicans.

""Google going to zero will not impact us at all,"" Last said.

""Google Zero,"" an imagined future in which Google stops sending web surfers to external sites and answers all search questions within its own platform, has become a morbid talking point in media circles. It's not so far-fetched. People have become less likely to click on external links since Google introduced AI summaries in its search results, a Pew Research Center study found.

In many ways, The Bulwark's strategy is typical of certain media startups that grew in the post-Facebook, post-search era. The founders of these startups have tried to avoid relying on referral traffic from tech platforms, determined not to repeat the fate of some in the previous generation of news and culture media companies.

This story is one of a five-part series exploring the changing online search landscape and its impact on consumers, media companies, advertisers, and tech platforms.

Stay tuned for:

Vice Media and BuzzFeed, for example, were once valued at over a billion dollars each in the mid-2010s, when several tech giants, including Facebook, offered access to large audiences. Those valuations plummeted when the algorithms changed and the traffic gusher stopped. Many digital publishers, including Business Insider, have also been affected by those algorithm changes.

Newer media startups have their own platform dependencies — particularly on Google-owned YouTube for video — but have often tried to limit their exposure by focusing on direct reader relationships through email and events.

""When you rely on a platform for your audience, you're at the mercy of the platform,"" Last said.

Business Insider interviewed the founders of nine young media startups that have grown — often profitably — without relying on Google and Facebook traffic. They include political outlets like The Bulwark, as well as more niche players such as Ankler Media (Hollywood), Hell Gate (local New York City news), and Aftermath (gaming). They range in size from small operations like Emily Sundberg's Feed Me and the four-person, bootstrapped A Media Operator, to Semafor, which has 90 employees and has raised a net $34 million in funding.

Major exits and big capital raises are rare in this new era, and no startups have anywhere near the head count of publishers like Bloomberg or The New York Times. One standout deal came in October, when Paramount Skydance bought Bari Weiss' The Free Press, the anti-woke media company born on Substack, for $150 million. As part of the deal, Paramount CEO David Ellison named Weiss the editor in chief of CBS News.

Many newer media outlets started as email newsletters, enabled by platforms like Substack and Beehiiv, which offer financial incentives, community-building tools, and support services to journalists who migrate from mainstream news outlets. Some, including Status, Ankler Media, and Feed Me, were founded by solo operators. Those outlets have since branched out to other revenue and distribution streams like events, ads, podcasts, and video.

The Bulwark and Ankler Media, for example, use a mix of YouTube, social media, and their own fans to reach new audiences.

""Our members are big evangelists,"" Last said. ""They forward emails, they tell their friends. That is a huge source of growth for us.""

One key takeaway from the founders: Media startups today must offer something readers can't get anywhere else, whether it's scoopy info or a unique point of view, to win subscribers.

Ankler Media subscribers pay $169 annually for highly specific industry information, like what jobs are available in a shrinking Hollywood and which kinds of projects are getting the green light. The company is profitable and on track to make roughly $10 million in revenue this year, cofounder and CEO Janice Min said.

""The more granular we get, the better we do,"" said Min, who revitalized The Hollywood Reporter before partnering with Richard Rushfield to turn his newsletter The Ankler into a full-fledged media company. ""Sometimes you want to take a big swing at a story, but there's no point in doing the same thing everyone's doing. I always say, no one wants to read the story about how crappy the industry is. We're always trying to find solutions for people to find work.""

Oliver Darcy left CNN last year to launch the scoops-focused media newsletter Status, which now serves 100,000 free subscribers and employs four people profitably. (Darcy, a former Business Insider staffer, declined to share how many people pay $150 annually for a subscription.) An early coup: uncovering RFK Jr.'s relationship with New York magazine reporter Olivia Nuzzi, which drove a lot of subs.

Worker-owned startup Hell Gate's pitch is that it covers New York with an irreverent, skeptical eye. Accountability stories like an exposé of the city's police watchdog agency sit alongside city-specific slices of life about parking privilege abuse and cheap eats. The company said it is profitable and expects to pull in around $850,000 in subscription revenue this year, supplemented by donations and newsletter ads.

Global news outlet Semafor, one of the few startups in this cohort to raise outside capital, has distinguished itself through its target audience: elites who advertisers will pay a lot to reach.

Semafor CEO Justin Smith bills his site as a ""luxury news brand."" He said this has helped the outlet charge as much as $200 per 1,000 ad impressions — four times the amount of its close competitors — and achieve profitability without a paywall. To cater to this audience, Semafor has focused on hiring big-name journalists, approaching coverage with a global mindset, and using formats that emphasize transparency.

Many of today's startup founders make money from subscriptions, but have also expanded their revenue streams through live events and advertising.

Ankler Media, built on Substack, gets 35% of its revenue from events sponsored by companies like Meta and McKinsey, which value the publication's narrow, focused audience.

Three years in, Semafor now generates 50% of its revenue from events, with the rest coming from advertising. It has hosted over 200 events so far, and its 2025 World Economy Summit, held in April, convened more than 200 chief executives.

Startups like Ankler Media and The Bulwark are also leaning into podcasts and video, which readers increasingly prefer to text articles. 1440, a daily news digest delivered via newsletter, makes explainer topic pages on subjects ranging from business to science and history, which it produces in both text and video formats.

For emerging companies, getting direct payments from readers is often more lucrative and predictable than ad revenue.

""Members are the only way that I've been able to figure out how to make this thing be sustainable for the long run,"" Last said. Over 110,000 of The Bulwark's 890,000 subscribers are paying customers, he said.

Jacob Donnelly, formerly publisher of Morning Brew, which shares a parent company with Business Insider, founded and runs a profitable digital-media business newsletter called A Media Operator. He's pushing enterprise subscriptions over individual ones. While the revenue per person is less — the price for 10 seats could run $300 a year per person versus $395 for an individual membership, for example — he said it's worth it if he can charge a company for 10 to 20 seats.

One upside of a narrow focus: Many of these startups have built communities around their brands that, in theory, can translate into loyalty and subscription revenue.

Community-building efforts can include hosting parties or encouraging people to comment in online discussions.

Hell Gate and Feed Me, a ""daily newsletter about the spirit of enterprise,"" have hosted parties for subscribers. That's ""community right there, getting people out on a Wednesday night,"" said Sundberg, Feed Me's founder.

""It feels great meeting and talking to our subscribers in real life, and it's been good for us,"" said Christopher Robbins, Hell Gate's editor and cofounder.

Aftermath, a five-person publication covering gaming, speaks directly to the community by meeting readers where they are already congregating: the livestreaming platform Twitch.

""People come and they talk in the comments, and to me, it's a nice way for us and readers, or listeners in this case, to interact,"" said Riley MacLeod, an Aftermath editor and co-owner.

Still, cultivating community can be tough, especially with everything else founders have going on. Casey Newton, founder of tech-news startup Platformer, has shared online that it's been hard to get his audience of tech company employees to comment publicly on his Discord.

In the era of the creator economy, these brands often put personality front and center. For founders, one question they face is how reliant they want to be on their own star power.

The most dynamic media startups now are individual-fronted brands, said Brian Morrissey, founder of The Rebooting, a newsletter about building media companies. He cited ""TBPN,"" the buzzy tech talk show, as an example. ""The problem is, it doesn't scale, it's exhausting, it's so risky. It's about how you continue it for the long term without diluting the brand.""

Sundberg built a profitable media business by serving as the primary voice of her Substack newsletter. While she is still the face of the brand, hosting events every other month, she now leads a small team of writers, editors, and freelancers. This month, she launched a video podcast, ""Expense Account,"" that stars a collaborator, J Lee, rather than herself.

""I'm spending a lot of time building the business side of Feed Me,"" Sundberg said, and that doesn't require having ""every single one of my 10 fingers on it.""

Ankler Media started around sharp-elbowed columnist Rushfield, but it has grown less reliant on him and Min as ambassadors for the brand as the staff has expanded to 14.

""I don't do as much TV as I used to,"" Min said. ""But our people are out there.""

Workweek launched in 2021 and built a business around a set of 21 B2B creators who wrote newsletters on topics such as fintech, marketing, and healthcare. It has since been trimmed to seven newsletters and pivoted to building out a few social platforms to connect readers to each other, rather than relying solely on its big-name voices.

Workweek CEO Adam Ryan said that the creators remain a core part of the business, but the goal is to build a system where readers can interact with each other, ask questions about their businesses, and create content.

Even if they're not worried about Google search, these startups have their own set of headaches.

Newsletter publishers are regularly fighting to avoid email spam filters and find new audiences as some of their existing readers unsubscribe. Being small and scrappy means figuring out things like payroll and legal coverage. Twelve-hour days aren't uncommon. Substack has powerful recommendation features that can create a type of platform dependency.

""Costs increase every year, so you have to grow every year,"" said Donnelly of A Media Operator. ""I want to build a business that's successful and returns capital to me and provides an opportunity to do good work. Staying sustainable is important to accomplish that. Also, if you don't grow, you're vulnerable to churn.""

For upstarts built by journalists, selling subscriptions can be a big adjustment.

""I'm the guy who deals with all the money, and this is my first time knowing anything about business,"" Aftermath's MacLeod said.

Every path to making money in media has its challenges. Events are good at convening people, but they are labor-intensive and hard to scale. Advertising and subscriptions are crowded.

And in ways still unknowable, AI will disrupt media. That's one reason many recent media founders have prioritized growing their operations slowly and sustainably. Well, that and the lack of easy VC money.

""Each model has its own flaws,"" Morrissey said of the media landscape. ""I'm glad people are still building. People will always be creating media companies. They're just smaller.""

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Niki Leondakis, the CEO of CorePower Yoga, a yoga studio with over 220 locations in 23 states. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I spent over 30 years in hospitality, and after leading three different hotel companies, I became CEO of Equinox.

Then I went through some personal turbulence.

In 2017, my home burned to the ground from the California wildfires. Exactly a year later, my husband died of a sudden heart attack.

I found myself in this 12-month period without a husband, without my career, and without a home. So I took a break and tried to figure out what my life was going to look like in its next chapter.

Business Insider's Power Hours series gives readers an inside look at how powerful leaders in business structure their workday. See more stories from the series here, or reach out to editor Lauryn Haas to share your daily routine.

When I was going through that, the one thing that anchored me and helped me process my emotions was getting on my yoga mat every single day. So when the CorePower opportunity came my way five years ago, it was a dream job. I don't know if I would have been ready for any opportunity — but this one spoke to my heart.

I travel a lot to different studios or markets. I split my time between Denver and San Francisco, where we're headquartered. So my routine is not exactly the same every day, but there are some constants no matter what.

Here's a day in my life:

I wake up around 5:30 or 6 a.m., and I do a head-to-toe body scan. I'm very aware of the stress I carry in my body, and yoga helps me become more aware of it. Sometimes when I do my body scans I find my fists clenched. I lie there and I try to release where I feel stressed.

Then I do a short meditation and try to think about a word that represents my intention for the day, like ""patience"" or ""focus.""

I usually start my day with mushroom adaptogenic tea. There are claims about them helping with mental clarity and stress, and I'm prone to anxiety. I've done a decent job learning how to manage it, but I can let things spin me up pretty easily.

My tea routine includes not just the tea, but my supplements. I take Vital Earth Minerals Super Multi, a liquid multivitamin with fulvic minerals. I keep it right next to the milk I put in my tea. I find that by stacking it, I don't forget to take my vitamins.

Then I try to go outside. It makes a huge difference in helping me gain perspective on whatever issues I have. The magnitude of nature helps me see that I'm putting energy into something that actually doesn't matter that much.

Before I get on my yoga mat, I often scan my email for 30 to 45 minutes. I generally have something that I know has to get done, and I try to do that first thing so it's not hanging over my head.

Then I get to my yoga practice. I have a yoga teacher, who I've been working with for 15 years. So, I'll either get on my mat at home and practice with her, or I'll go to a CorePower studio or tune in to a livestream.

Even on the busiest days, I have what I call my minimum required practice, or MRP. Even if it's just 15 minutes, I try to do sun salutations, breath work, and ground myself.

I don't eat in the morning until I'm hungry. But if I had a really vigorous practice, I'll have Greek yogurt with chia seeds, fresh berries, and some low-sugar type of granola. Usually at that time, I'll have a second cup of my mushroom tea.

My first calls are around 8:30 or 9 a.m., and I have them on Zoom or in our headquarters boardroom. I typically visit studios or meet with managers and leaders. Sometimes, I'll do a listening tour with our yoga teachers.

For me to be my best self, I cannot be in back-to-back meetings. I need time to process, or maybe send a follow-up email.

When I have big presentations or something high-stakes, my assistant knows to schedule 30 minutes before the meeting so I can ground myself and do breath work.

I'm introverted. I think of my body, mind, and spirit as an iPhone. My battery charges up in my alone time, whether that's getting outside, spending time in nature, practicing meditation, engaging in breath work, or reading. I find it enjoyable to interact in a big social environment, but the battery goes down. So I can't run from large group events to a meeting. I need to recharge.

During late spring, summer, and early fall, I try to wrap up my workday to get outside on a bike ride, a walk, or even a hike. Sometimes it's only 30 minutes, but I get outside and get some physical activity.

Sleep has been a challenge my whole life, and it's still a work in progress, but I've adopted some routines that have helped me. I used to tell myself that I could function on very little sleep. I'd be in bed at 2 a.m., up at 6 a.m., and bouncing on a stage at 9 a.m.

I had a lot of energy, but was I my best self? Was that my best effort? No, because I didn't have enough sleep. So now I try really hard. I try to do something zen, like reading or puzzling. Then I get into bed, and if I'm still wound up, I use Insight Timer's sleep meditations.

I still fall into the trap of staying up late sometimes, but I try to remind myself that my bedtime will impact my performance the next day. That helps me stay committed to getting to bed at a reasonable hour.

My internet bill crept up by about $15 a month over the summer. I know I can likely lower it by comparing rates to a competitor company, but I've been pushing off that phone call because I'm exhausted from dealing with automated systems, long call wait times, and automated voices that can't decipher what I'm saying when I beg to speak with a human.

It all seemed more work than it was worth. But what if I could outsource this chore, for free?

Using a generative AI voice tool, I was able to turn myself into an agent. Agentic me was tasked with trying to get my internet price lowered and programmed to be short on patience. Its bossy tone made me cringe and feel sympathy for the human worker on the other side. My agent often restated some version of what the customer service rep told it, then said it was disappointed, and started hallucinating lower rates offered by competitor companies to compare prices. ""I've been a loyal customer for a while now and I don't think it's fair that new customers get better deals,"" my agent snapped. ""It sounds like you're telling me I should just go ahead and cancel.""

In the AI boom, just as customers are straining to get human representatives on the line, human representatives are now straining to decipher if they're talking to human customers. Call center workers are up against convincing deepfake tech as the realistic distance between human and agentic callers narrows. As AI tools for consumers become widely available, there's also opportunities for people to use them not just for malicious fraud, but to troll call centers by sending agents to attack them en masse and waste time. Or, as in my case, as a regular, frazzled customer turning to them to make calls on their behalf.

""We are in the early days of a large emerging problem,"" says Brian Levin, chief customer officer at Reality Defender, which makes software for governments, financial institutions, and other businesses to detect the likelihood that content was generated by AI in real time (Reality Defender helped me navigate the process of making myself an agent for this story). And the development of agentic callers ""is moving much faster than these contact centers typically do.""

""Across industries, there's a surge in AI voice agents targeting customer support service lines, driving new forms of fraud while dramatically increasing call volumes and operational strain,"" says Emily Fontaine, global head of venture capital at IBM, a partner and investor in Reality Defender, tells me in an email.

Patrick Carroll, founder and CEO of deepfake detector ValidSoft, tells me in an email that call centers are increasingly fielding calls from agents that attempt to thwart security protocols and authentication methods. ""Even companies with strong defences are seeing rising call volumes as voice automation tools become more accessible and sophisticated,"" he says.

AI is a catch-22 for customer service. A report released earlier this year by the IT research firm Gartner predicts that AI agents will resolve 80% of common issues for customers by 2029, potentially cutting operating costs by 30%. Another Gartner survey of customer support leaders found that 85% of them are interested in or using AI chatbots, but only 11% report that the investment so far has ""mostly"" or ""fully"" met expectations. As they try to figure out how automation in customer service works best, fraudsters and callers who want to use agents themselves could upend the model, and trigger an AI vs. AI arms race.

The easier it becomes to have a no-nonsense, hardline negotiating AI version of you call up your cable provider, your dentist, or Williams Sonoma, the number of customers creating AI versions of themselves will multiply. Daniel O'Sullivan, a senior director analyst at Gartner, tells me that ""customers want to outsource these types of requests,"" and companies will eventually ""have to get with the program.""

But, O'Sullivan adds, allowing agentic callers poses risks for companies: They need to find ways to evaluate calls for fraud, may receive more calls seeking service as the lift to deal with minor billing or service problems lowers, and they could lose out on building relationships with customers, something that human agents do when they go above and beyond for callers.

Attempts to thwart call waiting aren't new. About half of customers say they try third-party channels, like Google, Reddit, or ChatGPT, to try to resolve a service issue before they even bother contacting the company, according to another 2025 survey from Gartner. In 2010, a startup called LucyPhone tried to best call waiting. It allowed people to hang up on customer service, and then receive a call back when it was their turn in line. The Reserve with Google tool can book restaurant reservations on your behalf. DoNotPay, a startup that uses AI to help people fight fees, tickets, and search for money users may be owed, has gained attention for successfully acting as an advocate for individuals against big corporations that often have roadblocks to contact.

Setting the agent up to do my bidding took some finessing, and about an hour's worth of work to clone my voice from audio in a radio interview I did, and then program the necessary info for my account, so my agent knew it like the back of its cold, coded hand. It wasn't a time saver, but this voice generating tech has become remarkably more sophisticated and simpler than when I tried a similar experiment with my bank just six months ago. Back then, I had to painstakingly generate each sentence and all of the information I might need, anticipating the questions I would be asked by the representative before getting on the call. I had to save them as audio files, and then hit play on each quickly when asked. But programming this conversational agent was more like creating a character with a few boundaries and setting it loose to chat in real-time.

""It's entirely feasible for somebody to do that just as a hobby project just to really make a point,"" says Matt Smallman, a call center security expert. ""People are a bit nervous about what the future does hold,"" when it comes to calling, he says. It's easy to imagine a world in which these tools become so easy to use, more people would take them up — both to troll call centers, and to handle the mundane and tedious tasks of contacting help lines for banks, healthcare systems, and retail companies.

Agent me was not able to convince the call center worker that I deserved to have my bill lowered back to the promotional rate (the customer service rep told me that the company doesn't match competitor prices, and once my introductory rate came to a close, there wasn't a better offer to give me). But it did try to keep the representative on the line, who showed no signs of suspicion that they were speaking to an agent. In a five-minute-long, sometimes tense back-and-forth, my agent repeatedly threatened to cancel service and said the rates offered just weren't good enough for a ""loyal customer"" like myself.

When the agent exhausted all options, it asked to be transferred to someone who could get the job done. I quickly cut it off, fearful that the agent might be too effective in canceling my much-needed wifi. The agent had a singular goal, and was willing to stay on the phone indefinitely to achieve it. Given the nuance of the situation, I'm not ready to unleash an agent to do my bidding — I'd rather call for myself and ask nicely.

In this article

Sinclair disclosed a stake in fellow broadcast station owner E.W. Scripps on Monday, in a move to push toward a merger of the companies.

Sinclair, which acquired a roughly 8% position in Scripps, per the filing, recently launched a strategic review of its own business that could result in a tie-up. Scripps, for its part, has seen its struggles mount in the competitive industry and is among the smallest of its peers.

In the filing, Sinclair said it has been engaged in ""constructive"" discussions regarding a deal and believes if it were to reach an agreement that a transaction could be completed within nine to 12 months.

Sinclair said in the filing that based on trading multiples there would be an expected $300 million in synergies if a merger were to take place.

Scripps' stock rose more than 40% on Monday, while Sinclair's stock was up 7%.

Sinclair, which acquired the stake for about $15.6 million, declined to comment beyond the SEC filing on Monday.

In a statement on Monday Scripps said its board ""will take all steps appropriate to protect the company and the company's shareholders from the opportunistic actions of Sinclair or anyone else.""

""Scripps' board of directors and management are focused on driving value for all of the company's shareholders through the continued execution of its strategic plan,"" the company said in its statement. ""The board and management are aligned on doing only what is in the best interest of all of the company's shareholders as well as its employees and the many communities and audiences it serves across the United States.""

The statement added that the board continues to evaluate ""any transactions and other alternatives that would enhance the value of the company and would be in the best interest of all company shareholders.""

Broadcast TV station group owners have suffered like the rest of media companies in recent years due to the shift away from the traditional pay-TV bundle and toward streaming. These broadcast stations, for the most part, make the majority of their money from so-called retransmission fees, which are paid on a per-subscriber rate by traditional TV distributors.

Broadcast station owners like Sinclair have been eager to do mergers as they push for deregulation under the Trump administration.

In August, Nexstar Media Group, the biggest owner of these stations, agreed to acquire Tegna for $3.54 billion.

Sinclair, meanwhile, is also considering spinning off or splitting its ventures unit, which includes pay-TV network The Tennis Channel and marketing technology business Compulse, which was recently rebranded Digital Remedy.

Sinclair and its advisors held discussions with potential merger partners earlier this year, CNBC previously reported.

In this article

DETROIT — Ford Motor is partnering with Amazon to let the automaker's franchised dealers sell certified preowned vehicles through the online retail giant.

The new program will allow customers to secure financing, start paperwork and schedule a pickup time for the vehicles at participating Ford dealers, the companies announced Monday. Some steps, such as a final signature, may still need to be completed in person, Ford said.

The deal comes two years after Amazon said it would allow auto dealers to sell cars through its site, starting with vehicles from South Korean automaker Hyundai.

The deals between Amazon and the two automakers differ, though, as Hyundai's involves new vehicles rather than certified preowned. CPO vehicles are used but have been inspected, refurbished and certified by the manufacturer or dealer. They're considered a better quality of used vehicles than cars without the designation and have warranties, like a new vehicle.

Amazon earlier this year also partnered with car rental company Hertz to sell used vehicles through its site.

Ford on Monday said more than 160 of its roughly 2,900 U.S. retailers have ""raised their hands"" and started the process with Amazon. Thus far, about a dozen have fully onboarded and launched, with about 10 more launching next week, the company said.

""The addition of Ford certified pre-owned vehicles to Amazon Autos represents an exciting expansion of our store, giving customers access to thousands of quality vehicles backed by Ford's comprehensive inspection and warranty programs,"" Fan Jin, global leader of Amazon Autos, said in a release.

Ford said it will offer a 14-day or 1,000-mile money-back guarantee, whichever comes first, on vehicles sold through the Amazon tie-up. The automaker also will offer three CPO certification levels of vehicles, with varying warranty coverages.

Ford said CPO vehicles are now available on Amazon Autos in Los Angeles, Seattle and Dallas, with plans to expand to additional cities in the coming months.

With Amazon's partnerships with Hyundai and Ford, the franchised dealer is still the end seller. Traditional automakers have complex relationships with dealers that are backed in many states by laws that make it difficult or illegal to bypass franchised dealers and sell new vehicles directly to consumers.

There are less stringent laws regarding used vehicle sales, which makes it easier for companies such as Carvana, Hertz and others to sell preowned cars and trucks online directly to consumers.

Switzerland's fledgling trade deal with the U.S. is dividing opinion as government and business leaders welcome a ""restart"" for the country, while critics caution it amounts to a sellout to the White House.

The trade deal, announced on Friday, saw duties on Swiss exports to the States slashed from 39% to 15% and Swiss companies pledge to make $200 billion in investments in the U.S., including promises to increase manufacturing Stateside.

Switzerland had launched a charm offensive ahead of the deal, sending a group of top Swiss CEOs — including the heads of luxury goods giants Rolex and Richemont — to the States in early November, bearing gifts for U.S. President Donald Trump, including a gold Rolex watch and specially-engraved gold bar.

While Switzerland's lobbying helped it secure its new framework trade agreement with the U.S., the deal drew criticism over the weekend.

The Greens, for example, called the deal a ""surrender agreement"" with party leader Lisa Mazzone reportedly saying the ""the Swiss economic elite and the Federal Council are bowing down to Donald Trump"" with Swiss consumers and farmers likely to pay the price.

The party also questioned the involvement of business execs, saying the government had bought the deal with ""questionable methods and gifts of gold.""

Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin rejected criticism that the deal amounted to a capitulation to Trump, and also defended the use of business leaders to woo the White House.

""We haven't sold our soul to the devil,"" Parmelin said in an interview with the Tagesanzeiger newspaper this weekend, adding that he was ""satisfied"" with the agreement and suggested it could still be tweaked and improved.

""I would be proud if we were back to zero percent tariffs. It's been a long road, and the result is the best we could achieve. Above all, it gives us a starting point for the next negotiations,"" he told the paper in comments translated by Google.

Parmelin said business execs who had travelled to Washington were only there to ""explain their position"" and how tariffs were affecting trade. He conceded, however, that the trip had had a positive impact on talks.

""But it's true: they have influence because they have many good contacts in the U.S. — and not just with the Trump family. Some are friends with him because they play golf with him. I don't play golf, that's perhaps my handicap — but that's life,"" Parmelin said.

Swiss industry leaders are certainly relieved that a framework agreement has been reached but it will take time to implement. Question marks remain over some of the details, such as whether Switzerland will have to accept U.S. meat imports like chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef, which are controversial in Europe, as part of the duty-free bilateral tariff quotas that have been agreed in principle.

The framework agreement is non-binding too, with more talks set to take place to finalize details within the deal which will ultimately need the Swiss parliament, and potentially a public vote, to approve it.

The U.S. was upbeat about the deal on Friday, with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer telling CNBC that the Swiss' $200 billion investment in the States would boost the domestic economy.

""They're going to send a lot of manufacturing here to the United States — pharmaceuticals, gold smelting, railway equipment — so we're really excited about that deal and what it means for American manufacturing.""

Swiss manufacturers are also relieved about the deal, according to Stefan Brupbacher, chief executive of Swissmem, an association which represents mechanical and electrical engineering industries who, he said, had seen a 15% drop in exports to the U.S. since August, with machine exporters hit even harder.

""For our members, there is great relief, because first of all, coming down from 39 to 15% puts us at par with our main competitors from Europe and Japan, and hence why we suffered enormously over the past three months with a slump of exports to the U.S. between 15% and 40%,"" he told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition.""

""This 15% tariff rate puts us at par with our main competitors, and that is a basis on which we can restart,"" he said.

Flash data released by the Swiss economy ministry on Monday showed the economy shrank by 0.5% in the third quarter of 2025. The contraction, the ministry said, was ""driven by a sharp decline in value added in the chemical and pharmaceutical sector, industry as a whole recorded negative growth.""

Alessandro Bee, economist at UBS, said in analysis Monday that despite the framework deal between the U.S. and Switzerland, UBS' base case scenario was that the Swiss economy would see GDP growth of around 1% in 2026, which, it noted, ""is noticeably below the average growth of 1.9% over the past 15 years.""

""Growth should be supported by the domestic economy, while we do not expect any significant impetus from foreign trade,"" Bee said, cautioning that despite the reduction in trade duties, ""tariffs on exports to the U.S. remain substantial and are likely to markedly slow export growth to the U.S. compared to the previous year.""

Noting that around half of Swiss exports to the U.S. are made up by the pharmaceutical industry, which was never affected by the 39% tariff, Bee said that any relocation of some pharma manufacturing to the States — which some Swiss pharma companies have flagged — could dent the economy further.

""Nonetheless, Swiss pharmaceutical companies have indicated they are prepared to relocate production for the American market to the U.S., and this newly reached deal is unlikely to change these plans. We expect relocation of pharmaceutical production will weigh on Swiss growth in the medium term.""

In this article

Chipmakers and analysts are warning of a memory chip shortage that could hit the consumer electronics and automotive industries next year, as companies prioritize massive demand from the artificial intelligence boom. 

In an earnings call on Friday, the CEO of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China's largest contract chipmaker, said that fears of a memory chip shortage were prompting its customers to hold back orders for other types of chips used in their products.

""Everyone is hesitant to place too many orders or ship too much in the first quarter of next year because they don't know how many mobile phones, cars, or other products [the memory chip industry] can supply,"" said Zhao Haijun, SMIC's co-CEO, according to a Google translation. 

Analysts say these supply constraint concerns come as chip manufacturers focus on advanced memory chips used in artificial intelligence computing, with less focus on production needed for consumer products. 

""The AI build-out is absolutely eating up a lot of the available chip supply, and 2026 looks to be far bigger than this year in terms of overall demand,"" Dan Nystedt, vice president of research at TriOrient, told CNBC. 

AI servers primarily run on processors from chip designers like Nvidia. These AI processors heavily rely on a type of memory known as High-Bandwidth Memory or HBM, which has proven extremely lucrative for memory companies like SK Hynix and Micron to pursue. 

Memory suppliers have been chasing as much of this AI demand as possible thanks to typically high margins, Nystedt said, noting that AI server companies are willing to pay top dollar for premium chips. 

""It could be very bad for PCs, laptops, consumer electronics and automotive, which depend on cheap memory chips,"" he said. 

Perhaps a bigger issue, however, is that the memory industry suffered some severe downturns in 2023 and part of 2024, leading to under-investment in the industry. ""They're building new capacity now, but it will take time to get running.""

In the face of supply constraints, memory companies have reportedly been raising prices of their chips. 

Just last Friday, Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics had quietly raised prices on select memory chips by as much as 60% compared to September. Samsung didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 

""With memory prices rising and availability shrinking, concerns about production bottlenecks are gaining traction,"" M.S. Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. 

""Supply tightness is already hitting low-end smartphones and set-top boxes, but we think the risk could broaden,"" he added. 

China is ""feeling the pinch more acutely"" due to high reliance on low-cost devices, but Hwang cautioned that the supply constraints were a global problem.  

In the meantime, consumers could pay the price of memory shortages. 

In a report on Monday, tech-focused market intelligence and consulting firm TrendForce predicted that the memory industry has begun a ""robust upward pricing cycle,"" which could force downstream brands to hike retail prices, adding pressure on the consumer market.

As a result, the research group predicted increased price and demand pressures for consumer products like smartphones and notebooks.

Wall Street veteran Jeffrey Gundlach said many assets are extremely overpriced right now, urging investors to keep about 20% of their portfolios in cash to protect against a major downturn.

Speaking on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast, the DoubleLine Capital CEO warned that the stock market looks dangerously speculative, saying it's among the least healthy he's seen in his entire career. The Dartmouth grad who started his Wall Street career in the mid-1980s at TCW Group today sees speculative excess in AI-related stocks and data-center investments, cautioning that momentum investing during a boom can end badly.

Gundlach is especially worried about the rapid growth of private credit, a $1.7 trillion market that lends directly to companies. He said lenders are making ""garbage loans"" similar to what happened before the 2008 mortgage crisis, pointing to recent failures like auto lender Tricolor and car parts supplier First Brands Group as early warning signs.

""The next big crisis in the financial markets is going to be private credit,"" he said. ""It has the same trappings as subprime mortgage repackaging had back in 2006.""

Gundlach also criticized the push to sell private credit funds to retail investors, calling it a ""perfect mismatch"" where there's a promise for easy withdrawals despite the fact those assets can't typically be sold quickly. If investors pull money out, funds may be forced to sell at steep losses, he said.

Despite his warnings, Gundlach admits it's hard to profit directly from this view. He won't short junk bonds, for example, because the trade keeps losing money, he said.

He said he still likes gold but has reduced his recommended allocation to 15%. Gundlach had recommended a 25% gold position in mid-September, based on his belief that inflation would stay stubbornly elevated because of the impact of tariffs on import prices.

After a few weeks of intense focus on whether there is an AI bubble in the markets or not, a recurrent character of 2025 has emerged to the fore: tariffs. 

On Friday stateside, tech stocks recovered slightly after the Nasdaq hit its lowest level in about 3 weeks, perhaps indicating that the AI-fueled volatility could be nearing an end. 

However, just as AI steps away from the spotlight, tariffs enter the stage, like the next act in a Shakespearean play. 

The Trump administration reached a deal with Switzerland Friday stateside to lower duties on Swiss exports to 15% from 39%, in return for a $200 billion investment in the U.S. by the end of 2028. 

On the homefront, Trump also started to roll back tariffs on goods such as coffee, fruits and certain beef products after acknowledging that prices, specifically coffee, ""were a little bit high.""

These rollbacks mark a sharp reversal in stance for the U.S. President and his officials, which said that tariffs will not raise prices. 

In a way, the U.S. President may try to change the laws of politics with his sweeping tariff moves, but even he cannot change the laws of economics.

Epstein files release. U.S. President Donald Trump called on Republicans in Congress to vote to release files related to deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a sharp reversal from previous resistance within his inner circle.

Alibaba reportedly helping China military. Alibaba is helping the Chinese military to target the U.S., according to a White House memo, the Financial Times reported Friday. ""The assertions and innuendoes in the article are completely false,"" Alibaba said in a statement to CNBC on the FT report.

Japan GDP falls. Japan's economy contracted by a smaller-than-expected 1.8% in the third quarter on an annualized basis, with growth in private and government consumption limiting the decline. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP in the three months to September contracted for the first time in six quarters, falling 0.4%.

Nasdaq recovers. The tech heavy index rebounded on Friday as investors bought up shares of key technology stocks, a day after the group led Wall Street to its worst day in more than a month. Asia-Pacific markets were mixed Monday as investors assessed rising friction between Japan and China. 

[PRO] AI and EM for the next decade. Artificial intelligence and emerging markets are set to define the next decade, according to Goldman Sachs' 10 year investment outlook report.

Japan to dispatch senior envoy to China, NHK says, as travel warning drives tourism selloff in Tokyo

Japan on Monday said it dispatched a senior foreign ministry official to China to ease rising tensions, public broadcaster NHK reported, as tourism-exposed stocks in Tokyo slumped amid the diplomatic feud.

Masaaki Kanai, a director-general at Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is expected to meet his counterpart Liu Jinsong on Tuesday, according to media outlet Kyodo.

Japan's tourism-exposed stocks fell Monday after Beijing issued a travel and study alert for its citizens considering going to Japan.

Actor-entrepreneur Mark Wahlberg paid $37 million for a fully furnished mansion in Delray Beach, Florida last month. The deal piqued interest and prompted coverage from TMZ to the Architectural Digest, with most of the focus on the celebrity buyer.

But aside from the name recognition, the home's skyrocketing price over the past five years also makes it stand out.

The actor's transaction in October marks the home's fourth sale in that same time period, and a dramatic 118% price increase from its sale in January 2020 when the fully furnished mansion traded for $17 million.

The estate, located at 9200 Rockybrook Way, saw a rise in value that outpaced not just the local market, but also many of the top luxury markets in America.

In Delray Beach, the average sale price for a single-family luxury home, represented by the top 10% of closed sales, rose by just over 78%; Los Angeles was up 30%; the Hamptons rose 44%; and Manhattan increased just 4.5% according to Elliman Report data from the first quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2025.

The home's steep rise in value even outperformed the S&P 500, which was up about 100% over the same time period.

Remarkably, the residence has traded hands four times since 2020. Just one real estate broker represented the listing in all four transactions, making the soaring value of the seven-bedroom 10-bath mansion even more unique.

Back in 2020, Douglas Elliman real estate broker Senada Adzem represented the original owners of 9200 Rockybrook, when the house was known as the Sundara estate. Three years later, Adzem represented the mansion's second owners who listed the home again, when it sold for $26 million, up 53% in just three years.

A little over a year after buying the place, public records show a trust connected to William Cafaro, the co-president of a retail property development company in Niles, Ohio, and the home's third resident decided to sell. Adzem was once again the listing agent.

This transaction was more unusual. Cafaro sold the home as part of a larger $50.5 million deal to purchase a Ferrari-inspired mansion less than half mile up the road in Stone Creek Ranch. Casa Maranello, as it's known, was being sold by local developer Aldo Stark, of Prestige Design Homes, with Adzem as the listing agent.

Cafaro paid for the new home with $24.5 million in cash, plus the deed to 9200 Rockybrook Way, which was valued in the deal at the same price he'd paid for it: $26 million. 

When that sale closed in January 2025, Stark became the fourth owner of the mansion and he immediately started a dramatic multimillion-dollar renovation of the almost 17,800-square-foot megahome. He scrapped the old Sundara name and clad the home's old sheet-rocked walls in polished rare stones and bold high-gloss Guyana wood from Brazil.

He installed vibrant green vegetation above a grand stairway and into the ceilings.

Stark completely reimagined everything from the kitchen to the clubroom and filled the residence with bespoke furniture.

And about two moths after closing, the megahome was listed for sale for a fourth time.  

Reemerging with a new look, new name, and a new price tag, one of the few things to remain the same was that Adzem was once again the listing agent.  

The home, now called Palazzo di Lago, debuted with an ambitious $45 million asking price, $19 million more than what Stark paid for it two months earlier and 165% more than what it sold for in 2020.

By October Adzem closed the fourth deal and delivered Palazzo di Lago to its fifth owner, who the buyer's broker, Michael Costello of Compass, confirmed to CNBC was Mark Wahlberg.

According to Florida's Multiple Listing Service, the fully furnished mansion closed at $37 million, $11 million more than what Stark bought it for seven months earlier, and up 118% from its 2020 sale. 

And Adzem pulled off an uncommon feat in real estate, selling the same house four times in five years in transactions totaling $106 million.

Five owners across five years seems like an unusually high turnover rate, but Adzem has a simple explanation.

""People's circumstances change and they have different chapters in their life. So we were privileged to be able to guide this home through different evolutions and different owners and be able to add value to it,"" Adzem said.

According to Adzem, the mansion's remarkable appreciation was fueled by a multitude of factors. Here are the top five:

Adzem attributed a large part of the 54% rise in price from 2020 to 2023 to the pandemic, which made demand and prices for homes in South Florida surge.

""After Covid, our market definitely accelerated,"" she told CNBC.

Some of the other market dynamics driving the price of Palazzo di Lago are unique to Stone Creek Ranch, which Adzem described as a luxury ""micro-market.""

The exclusive gated community spans about 187 acres with 37 luxury homes each on about 2.5 acre lots. It's a tight supply that's seen pricing dramatically impacted by a wave of new construction homes that have traded at record-breaking prices. Those recent comps helped push the price of Palazzo di Lago higher.

Even the price of dirt in Stone Creek Ranch is on a steep rise. Back in 2013, the empty lot at 9200 Rockybrook Way traded for $800,000. In 2021, Adzem sold a comparable 2.5-acre lot for $1.7 million.

""The last one they traded was $6 million,"" Adzem told CNBC. ""However ... there are no vacant lots left in this community.""

And Adzem believes a more than threefold rise in the price of dirt here is just the beginning. She points to the fact that 2.5-acre lots worthy of a megahome are hard to come by in Palm Beach County, and the dwindling supply in this neighborhood in particular will push lot prices even higher. 

""I feel like the dirt is going to double because the only upcoming potential sales would be teardowns.""

Another market driver: the tiny community's growing list of VIP owners.

In 2021, billionaire hedge fund manager and owner of the New York Mets, Steve Cohen purchased the home next door to 9200 Rockybrook Way for about $22 million, according to MLS.

""[Potential buyers] typically do look to know who else owns in the community. That's important to them,"" Adzem said. 

Rich and famous residents can create a halo effect and make nearby real estate more desirable to potential buyers. And there's no shortage of ultra-high-net-worth neighbors living nearby, including several present and former CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, a former NFL player and a pop star, according to Adzem and public records.

And now some might even see Walhberg's new ownership as adding to the community's allure. Meanwhile, developer Aldo Stark just finished construction and recently moved into his own 32,000-square-foot mansion.

Wealthy buyers looking to escape the tax burdens of their home states continue to see the tax advantages offered in Florida as a big draw and that helps drive and sustain demand.

""We saw a big influx and continued influx of buyers from California, from New York, from Connecticut, and they want what you see here,"" Adzem told CNBC.  

Adzem also credited Stark's renovation with adding to the estate's value.

""He didn't go neutral and he didn't go very light with color scheme. He really wanted to make an impact and put his own taste here,"" Adzem said.

Adzem and Stark would only characterize the expense as ""a multimillion-dollar renovation,"" so it's unclear exactly how much it took to turn a home built in 2017 into the new Palazzo di Lago.

But Adzem told CNBC the dramatic renovation and the new ""James-Bond-inspired vibe"" were the final catalysts that delivered a buyer willing to pay a premium.

Correction: William Cafaro paid for the new home with $24.5 million in cash. A previous version of this story omitted the million.

New video shows the moment Sunrise Police intervened to stop an 80-year-old man from sending money to criminals overseas who convinced him he needed to move the cash.

The body camera video shows police arriving as the man was on the phone with the scammers who were posing as his bank and directing him to put cash in a Bitcoin ATM.

""Sir, how much money have you put in here?"" an officer asks.

""Chase Bank is on the telephone,"" the man replies.

""No, Chase Bank is not on the telephone,"" the officer responds.

The man had several stacks of money with him that totaled $60,000.

Authorities said the man had already lost more than $50,000 before police intervened and stopped him from sending more.



Police were tipped off when the man's son noticed large withdrawals from his bank account and alerted officers.

Officials are warning that scammers try to convince people they are in trouble to get them to act fast.

“They created a sense of urgency to him, they told him they were from Chase Bank and that his bank account was compromised and some of the Chase Bank employees were in on it, so he needed to withdraw his money quickly to protect it,"" Sunrise Police Sgt. Marc Rodriguez said.

The scam started with a pop-up window on the man's computer and from there, the scammers sent him a link which he clicked on and gave them access to his personal information.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Inside a Wild Bitcoin Heist: Five-Star Hotels, Cash-Stuffed Envelopes, and Vanishing Funds","https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-scam-mining-as-service/","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

As Kent Halliburton stood in a bathroom at the Rosewood Hotel in central Amsterdam, thousands of miles from home, running his fingers through an envelope filled with €10,000 in crisp banknotes, he started to wonder what he had gotten himself into.

Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates bitcoin mining hardware on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States.

As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family. The family office had offered to purchase hundreds of bitcoin mining rigs from Sazmining—around $4 million worth—which the company would install at a facility currently under construction in Ethiopia. Before finalizing the deal, the family office had asked to meet Halliburton in person.

When Halliburton arrived at the Rosewood Hotel, he found Even and Maxim perched in a booth. They struck him as playboy, high-roller types—particularly Maxim, who wore a tan three-piece suit and had a highly manicured look, his long dark hair parted down the middle. A Rolex protruded from the cuff of his sleeve.

Over a three-course lunch—ceviche with a roe garnish, Chilean sea bass, and cherry cake—they discussed the contours of the deal and traded details about their respective backgrounds. Even was talkative and jocular, telling stories about blowout parties in Marrakech. Maxim was aloof; he mostly stared at Halliburton, holding his gaze for long periods at a time as though sizing him up.

As a relationship-building exercise, Even proposed that Halliburton sell the family office around $3,000 in bitcoin. Halliburton was initially hesitant, but chalked it up as a peculiar dating ritual. One of the guys slid Halliburton the cash-filled envelope and told him to go to the bathroom, where he could count out the amount in private. “It felt like something out of a James Bond movie,” says Halliburton. “It was all very exotic to me.”

Halliburton left in a taxi, somewhat bemused by the encounter, but otherwise hopeful of closing the deal with the family office. For Sazmining, a small company with around 15 employees, it promised to be transformative.

Less than two weeks later, Halliburton had lost more than $200,000 worth of bitcoin to Even and Maxim. He didn't know whether Sazmining could survive the blow, nor how the scammers had ensnared him.

Directly after his lunch with Even and Maxim, Halliburton flew to Latvia for a Bitcoin conference. From there, he traveled to Ethiopia to check on construction work at the data center facility.

While Halliburton was in Ethiopia, he received a WhatsApp message from Even, who wanted to go ahead with the deal on one condition: that Sazmining sell the family office a larger amount of bitcoin as part of the transaction, after the small initial purchase at the Rosewood Hotel. They landed on $400,000 worth—a tenth of the overall deal value.

Even asked Halliburton to return to Amsterdam to sign the contracts necessary to finalize the deal. Having been away from his family for weeks, Halliburton protested. But Even drew a line in the sand: “Remotely doesn't work for me that's not how I do business at the moment,” he wrote in a text message reviewed by WIRED.

Halliburton arrived back in Amsterdam in the early afternoon on August 16. That evening, he was due to meet Maxim at a teppanyaki restaurant at the five-star Okura Hotel. The interior is elaborately decorated in traditional Japanese style; it has wooden panelling, paper walls, a zen garden, and a flock of origami cranes that hang from string down a spiral staircase in the lobby.

Halliburton found Maxim sitting on a couch in the waiting area outside the restaurant, dressed in a gaudy silver suit. As they waited for a table, Maxim asked Halliburton whether he could demonstrate that Sazmining held enough bitcoin to go through with the side transaction that Even had proposed. He wanted Halliburton to move roughly half of the agreed amount—worth $220,000—into a bitcoin wallet app trusted by the family office. The funds would remain under Halliburton's control, but the family office would be able to verify their existence using public transaction data.

Halliburton thumbed open his iPhone. The app, Atomic Wallet, had thousands of positive reviews and had been listed on the Apple App Store for several years. With Maxim at his side, Halliburton downloaded the app and created a new wallet. “I was trying to earn this guy's trust,” says Halliburton. “Again, a $4 million contract. I'm still looking at that carrot.”

The dinner passed largely without incident. Maxim was less guarded this time; he talked about his fondness for watches and his work sourcing deals for the family office. Feeling under the weather from all the travel, Halliburton angled to wrap things up.

They left with the understanding that Maxim would take the signed contracts to the family office to be executed, while Halliburton would send the $220,000 in bitcoin to his new wallet address as agreed.

Back in his hotel room, Halliburton triggered a small test transaction using his new Atomic Wallet address. Then he wiped and reinstated the wallet using the private credentials—the seed phrase—generated when he first downloaded the app, to make sure that it functioned as expected. “Had to take some security measures but almost ready. Thanks for your patience,” wrote Halliburton in a WhatsApp message to Even. “No worries take your time,” Even responded.

At 10:45 pm, satisfied with his tests, Halliburton signaled to a colleague to release $220,000 worth of bitcoin to the Atomic Wallet address. When it arrived, he sent a screenshot of the updated balance to Even. One minute later, Even wrote back, “Thank yiu [sic].”

Halliburton sent another message to Even, asking about the contracts. Though previously quick to answer, Even didn't respond. Halliburton checked the Atomic Wallet app, sensing that something was wrong. The bitcoin had vanished.

Halliburton's stomach dropped. As he sat on the bed, he tried to stop himself from vomiting. “It was like being punched in the gut,” says Halliburton. “It was just shock and disbelief.”

Halliburton racked his brain trying to figure out how he had been swindled. At 11:30 pm, he sent another message to Even: “That was the most sophisticated scam I've ever experienced. I know you probably don't give a shit but my business may not survive this. I've worked four years of my life to build it.”

Even responded, denying that he had done anything wrong, but that was the last Halliburton heard from him. Halliburton provided WIRED with the Telegram account Even had used; it was last active on the day the funds were drained. Even did not respond to a request for comment.

Within hours, the funds drained from Halliburton's wallet began to be divided up, shuffled through a web of different addresses, and deposited with third-party platforms for converting crypto into regular currency, analysis by blockchain analytics companies Chainalysis and CertiK shows.

A portion of the bitcoin was split between different instant exchangers, which allow people to swap one type of cryptocurrency for another almost instantaneously. The bulk was funneled into a single address, where it was blended with funds tagged by Chainalysis as the likely proceeds of rip deals, a scam whereby somebody impersonates an investor to steal crypto from a startup.

“There's nothing illegal about the services the scammer leveraged,” says Margaux Eckle, senior investigator at Chainalysis. “However, the fact that they leveraged consolidation addresses that appear very tightly connected to labeled scam activity is potentially indicative of a fraud operation.”

Some of the bitcoin that passed through the consolidation address was deposited with a crypto exchange, where it was likely swapped for regular currency. The remainder was converted into stablecoin and moved across so-called bridges to the Tron blockchain, which hosts several over-the-counter trading services that can be readily used to cash out large quantities of crypto, researchers claim.

The effect of the many hops, shuffles, conversions, and divisions is to make it more difficult to trace the origin of funds, so that they can be cashed out without arousing suspicion. “The scammer is quite sophisticated,” says Eckle. “Though we can trace through a bridge, it's a way to slow the tracing of funds from investigators that could be on your tail.”

Eventually, the trail of public transaction data stops. To identify the perpetrators, law enforcement would have to subpoena the services that appear to have been used to cash out, which are widely required to collect information about users.

From the transaction data, it's not possible to tell precisely how the scammers were able to access and drain Halliburton's wallet without his permission. But aspects of his interactions with the scammers provide some clue.

Initially, Halliburton wondered whether the incident might be connected to a 2023 hack perpetrated by threat actors affiliated with the North Korean government, which led to $100 million worth of funds being drained from the accounts of Atomic Wallet users. (Atomic Wallet did not respond to a request for comment.)

But instead, the security researchers that spoke to WIRED believe that Halliburton fell victim to a targeted surveillance-style attack. “Executives who are publicly known to custody large crypto balances make attractive targets,” says Guanxing Wen, head of security research at CertiK.

The in-person dinners, expensive clothing, reams of cash and other displays of wealth were gambits meant to put Halliburton at ease, researchers theorize. “This is a well-known rapport-building tactic in high-value confidence schemes,” says Wen. “The longer a victim spends with the attacker in a relaxed setting, the harder it becomes to challenge a later technical request.”

In order to complete the theft, the scammers likely had to steal the seed phrase for Halliburton's newly created Atomic Wallet address. Equipped with a wallet's seed phrase, anyone can gain unfettered access to the bitcoin kept inside.

One possibility is that the scammers, who dictated the locations for both meetings in Amsterdam, hijacked or mimicked the hotel Wi-Fi networks, allowing them to harvest information from Halliburton's phone. “That equipment you can buy online, no problem. It would all fit inside a couple of suitcases,” says Adrian Cheek, lead researcher at cybersecurity company Coeus. But Halliburton insists that his phone never left his possession, and he used mobile data to download the Atomic Wallet app, not public Wi-Fi.

The most plausible explanation, claims Wen, is that the scammers—perhaps with the help of a nearby accomplice or a camera equipped with long-range zoom—were able to record the seed phrase when it appeared on Halliburton's phone at the point he first downloaded the app, on the couch at the Okura Hotel.

Long before Halliburton delivered the $220,000 in bitcoin to his Atomic Wallet address, the scammers had probably set up a “sweeper script,” claims Wen, a type of automated bot coded to drain a wallet when it detects a large balance change.

The people the victim meets in-person in cases like this—like Even and Maxim—are rarely the ultimate beneficiaries, but rather mercenaries hired by a network of scam artists, who could be based on the other side of the globe.

“They're normally recruited through underground forums, and secure chat groups,” says Cheek. “If you know where you're looking, you can see this ongoing recruitment.”

For a few days, it remained unclear whether Sazmining would be able to weather the financial blow. The stolen funds equated to about six weeks worth of revenue. “I'm trying to keep the business afloat and survive this situation where suddenly we've got a cash crunch,” says Halliburton. By delaying payment to a vendor and extending the duration of an outstanding loan, the company was ultimately able to remain solvent.

That week, one of the Sazmining board members filed reports with law enforcement bodies in the Netherlands, the UK, and the US. They received acknowledgements from only UK-based Action Fraud, which said it would take no immediate action, and the Cyber Fraud Task Force, a division of the US Secret Service. (The CFTF did not respond to a request for comment.)

The incredible volume of crypto-related scam activity makes it all but impossible for law enforcement to investigate each theft individually. “It's a type of threat and criminal activity that is reaching a scale that's completely unprecedented,” says Eckle.

The best chance of a scam victim recovering their funds is for law enforcement to bust an entire scam ring, says Eckle. In that scenario, any funds recovered are typically dispersed to those who have reported themselves victims.

Until such a time, Halliburton has to make his peace with the loss. “It's still painful,” he says. But “it wasn't a death blow.”

Publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies added 54,156 ETH—currently worth about $170 million—to its balance sheet over the last week, the firm announced on Monday.

BitMine now holds 3,559,879 ETH valued at more than $11.1 billion, making it the largest publicly traded Ethereum treasury in the world, and the second largest crypto treasury overall behind Michael Saylor's Strategy and its $61 billion Bitcoin stash. The Ethereum-centric firm also holds 192 Bitcoin (about $18 million worth) and $607 million in cash.

Like Strategy, BitMine keeps accumulating ETH regardless of its price action. The second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization has dropped more than 11% in the last week, and is now 35% off its August all-time high.

Myriad predictors are almost evenly split on Ethereum's next move, predicting a nearly 51% likelihood of ETH falling to a price of $2,500 rather than rising to $4,000. But those odds have flipped several times over the last 24 hours as the price of Ethereum has shifted. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, Dastan.)

Despite the recent losses, BitMine Chairman Tom Lee is still calling for an Ethereum “supercycle,” predicting that prices have not peaked for this cycle. He further suggested, in an X post, that Ethereum could see a 100x rise in price in the long run, similar to Bitcoin's spike since Lee's firm Fundstrat first recommended holding the asset back in 2017.

""We look at five explanations for the crypto price cycle and conclude that two have important explanatory value,” said Lee in a statement. “Both of these suggest a crypto cycle top likely 12-36 months away.”

Bitcoin is a volatile asset. 

We first recommended Bitcoin to Fundstrat clients in 2017 (1%-2% allocation)- Bitcoin 2017 ~$1,000

Since then (past 8.5 years), $BTC:- 6 declines > -50%- 3 declines > - 75%

According to Lee, the market is still recovering from the record-breaking crypto liquidation event in October, which saw more than $19 billion positions wiped away in a single day. The lingering weakness, he added, lends some credence to the speculation that a market maker may have been severely impacted during the crash. 

“When a market maker has a 'hole' on their balance sheet, they are seeking to raise capital and are reducing their liquidity functions in the market,” he said. “This is the equivalent of QT (quantitative tightening) for crypto, and has the effect of dampening prices. In 2022, this QT effect lasted for 6-8 weeks. And this is probably happening today.""

Lee, who was an early Bitcoin bull, has remained bullish on year-end predictions. In early November, he suggested that Bitcoin could run to $150,000-$200,000 before the end of the year, with Ethereum potentially rising to $7,000. 

While Lee acts as the chairman and the most vocal spokesperson for BitMine, the firm added a new CEO on Friday. Shares of BMNR continued their slide after the opening bell on Monday, dropping by nearly 6% to change hands at $32.37.

BMNR is now down 35% in the last month, underperforming Ethereum and Bitcoin, which have dropped about 19% and 12%, respectively.

Oops, something went wrong

That's it. I'm done. I'm done with crypto. Lamest bull market of my life. didn't even make it to 150k. Tom Lee's Ethereum price prediction was wrong, and ETH made a new ATH for all of two seconds. There was no alt season.

And the only coins that did anything notable were flagrant casino 1000x tokens. Future of finance my ass.

Meanwhile, Ether cracked below the $3,100 level for the first time since early November, slipping to $3,066 on Sunday during a broader crypto pullback.

The drop came alongside a surge in ETF redemptions and growing concerns that Ethereum is becoming the “risk-on” trade of the sector. So what's going on with Ethereum? Is it dying?

Investment manager Timothy Peterson highlighted a worrying trend that isn't visible in headline ETF flows.

“Spot ether ETFs posted net outflows in four of the past five weeks, totaling roughly 7 percent of cost-basis capital,” Peterson said.

Cost-basis withdrawals track how much of the original capital committed to an ETF is leaving and it isn't look good for Ethereum. Rising redemptions here show conviction weakening among long-term holders, not just traders repositioning.

It leaves our Ethereum price prediction showing that the price will not be near the ATH again for the rest of 2025. Not good.

A sweep across key analytics platforms adds more context to the ETH price:

CoinGecko: Ether down 11 percent in 24 hours

DeFi Llama: ETH TVL fell 2.1 percent this week, reversing prior gains

FRED (Rates): Long-term yields remain elevated, restraining risk assets

Despite the volatility, ETH still trades comfortably above its 200-day moving average near $2,550, a level that has historically defined cycle support zones.

Ethereum's 4-hour chart shows price locked inside a narrowing falling wedge, which is a corrective pattern that often precedes upside breaks. ETH has repeatedly been rejected at the upper trendline and the stacked supply zones near $3,550 and $3,800.

A decisive reclaim of $3,350 will flip the short-term trend and open a path back toward $3,550. Failure keeps the wedge intact and elevates the risk of a $3,000 retest or even a quick liquidity sweep below it before any true reversal.

Ether slipping under $3,100 says more than a bad trading day. ETF outflows, shaky macro signals, and stubborn resistance have all piled onto the chart at the same time.

Even so, the deeper indicators still look solid, and the tightening wedge hints that a reversal could hit sooner than the mood suggests. Who knows, though. If there ever was a time for a project to flip Ethereum, it's now.

The Ethereum price has slipped deeper into a bearish structure that has intensified over the past week. A combination of weakening momentum, strong ETF outflows, and selling from long-term holders has dragged the price of Ethereum lower at a pace that has led to concerns about whether the cryptocurrency is preparing for a deeper correction. 

The latest decline has now placed the $3,000 region back into view and it opens up the question of whether the momentum behind this downturn is strong enough to force another breakdown below $3,000.

Ethereum Price Slips Below Moving Averages As ETF Outflows Deepen

New data from 10x Research reveals that Ethereum is now trading firmly below both the 7-day and 30-day moving averages, confirming a clean shift toward bearish momentum. The latest one-week change shows a decline of -6.6%, with the price failing to regain the short-term trendline at any point during the sell-off. 

The chart provided by the research firm illustrates how ETH-USD rolled over throughout early November as both moving averages curved downward, indicating that market structure has fully weakened.

This technical deterioration is unfolding at the same time the Ethereum ETF market is experiencing one of its heaviest redemptions on record. According to data from SoSoValue, spot ETH ETFs have now seen more than $1.4 billion in net outflows since the beginning of November, a change that shows the decisive shift in institutional appetite. 

The combination of sustained selling pressure and shrinking ETF demand has created a feedback loop that continues to pull ETH lower whenever each price support level fails.

Long-Term Holders Selling Fastest Since 2021, But Whales Are Accumulating

On-chain flows paint a picture of an ecosystem under strain. Data shows that long-term ETH holders, wallets that have held their coins for three to ten years, are now selling at their fastest rate since 2021. This group is known to be dormant during most phases of the market, so their recent activity has introduced a strong supply wave that exchanges have struggled to absorb. 

However, the dynamic is not entirely one-directional. On-chain data shows that a few large whale wallets have stepped in aggressively during the downturn and bought hundreds of thousands of ETH worth over $1 billion. 

Meanwhile, the scale of accumulation has not been large enough to counteract the broader selling from long-term holders or the ETF outflows, leaving the price of Ethereum trapped inside a downward-tilting trend channel.

Ethereum is now trading around $3,182, but its intraday low has stretched as far as $3,023. This leaves very little margin between the current level and the support zone at $3,000. If sellers continue to dominate and push the price below the $3,150 to $3,200 range, a direct slide to $3,000 becomes increasingly likely during the new week.

Over $620M in liquidations pushed the BitMEX founder to de-risk.

He cut risk during a downturn that liquidated over $620 million in positions.

Rising liquidity pressure and growing interest in privacy coins pushed him to buy more ZEC.

The market's taken a rough turn, and Arthur Hayes is trimming his sails.

The BitMEX Co-Founder offloaded nearly $5 million worth of tokens in a single day, cutting down his positions across several major altcoins. His moves came as the market slipped to multi-month lows, adding to an already uneasy week for traders.

Data from Lookonchain showed Arthur Hayes moving quickly to cut risk after the market's downturn, routing multiple transactions through FalconX and Wintermute. His largest sale was roughly $2.48 million in Ethereum [ETH], followed by $1.38 million in Ethena [ENA] and about $480,000 in Lido DAO [LDO].

Source: X

He also reduced positions in Aave [AAVE], Uniswap [UNI], and ether.fi, sending a combined few hundred thousand dollars' worth of tokens to OTC desks. The transfer history shows a clear unwind of exposure within hours.

The rapid exits have caused conversation about Hayes potentially rotating into Zcash [ZEC]. The narrative is gaining traction across X and Reddit.

More recently, Lookonchain reported that Hayes has sold 1,480 ETH worth $4.7 million over the past two days. However, his timing hasn't been strong. The last time he sold ETH on the 1st of August, it was the local bottom.

Source: X

He ended up buying back at a higher price just nine days later.

Hayes' rapid sell-off occurred during a period of deep market stress.

Over the past 24 hours, 152,035 traders were liquidated, wiping out nearly $620 million in positions, according to CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin [BTC] accounted for the largest share with $243.5 million in liquidations, followed by Ethereum at about $170 million. The Heatmap showed pockets of pressure across major altcoins as well, including ZEC, Solana [SOL], and Ripple [XRP].

Source: Coinmarketcap

The biggest single liquidation hit Hyperliquid's BTC-USD pair for $30.6 million. With leveraged trades unwinding at this scale, sentiment has changed. This creates an environment where large holders like Hayes can move defensively.

Building on that, Hayes' latest public call may have added to ZEC's surge.

After posting a ZEC/BTC chart and saying he had “aped more,” traders quickly took notice. The pair has been climbing steadily from around 0.0045 BTC and recently pushed through 0.0068 BTC.

A clear pattern of higher highs and higher lows. The chart also showed stronger volume.

Source: X

With rising interest and tighter liquidity, Hayes's buying confirmed the sentiment shift towards ZEC.

AMBCrypto previously reported that Hayes still sees room for the crypto market to grow.

He noted that past Bitcoin cycles peaked in Q4 after the halving and said this one could do the same in 2025. It could even stretch into 2026 if Trump boosts spending and keeps markets risk-on.

KEY TAKEAWAYS



 

Blockchain technology is a powerful tool for public administrators to get real-time, tamper-proof transparency in budgeting at a time when people are demanding more accountability and honesty from their governments. 

Governments can build trust with citizens, lower the risk of corruption, and improve financial management by using blockchain in important parts of the budget cycle, such as allocation, disbursement, and auditing. 

In this article, we will talk about how blockchain works in public budgeting, show examples of how it has been used in the real world, look at the pros and cons, and give administrators who want to use it some useful tips.

At its most basic level, blockchain is a distributed ledger. It is a shared record of transactions that is stored on many nodes, making sure that each transaction is cryptographically secure and cannot be changed once it is confirmed. 

This means that every budget document, fund allocation, or payment can be recorded in a way that citizens, auditors, and administrators can check for themselves and that can't be changed after the fact without being caught.

Smart contracts (self-executing code on the blockchain) also make it possible to automatically enforce financial rules. For example, funds can be released automatically when certain conditions are met, like project milestones being reached, invoices being submitted, or audits being finished.

 Blockchain is especially good for managing public finances because it lets you make programmable, conditional payments and hold people more accountable.

Blockchain is no longer just a theoretical tool for public finance; several governments and institutions are actively implementing it to enhance transparency, accountability, and efficiency.

By recording budget allocations, disbursements, and audits on a tamper-proof ledger, these initiatives demonstrate how blockchain can reduce fraud, streamline processes, and allow citizens and auditors to verify spending in real time. 

The following examples illustrate practical applications of blockchain in public budgeting around the world:

Perhaps one of the most concrete implementations is in the Philippines. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has launched a public portal that records Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) and Notices of Cash Allocation (NCAs) on a blockchain. 

Key Features:

This system represents a bold, practical deployment of blockchain in public finance, making critical budget documents verifiable by citizens and reducing the risk of document tampering. 

In another notable example, Guinea-Bissau has partnered with the IMF and other technical advisors to deploy a blockchain platform that manages its public wage bill. The platform records salary eligibility, pension disbursements, and payments in near real time on a tamper-evident ledger.

Benefits Include:

This is especially powerful in a country where the public wage bill once accounted for a very large percentage of tax revenue. 

On a global scale, the World Bank is pioneering a blockchain-based platform called FundsChain to track development‑project funding. The system leverages blockchain to provide a fully traceable, shared ledger of fund disbursement across partners, contractors, and governments.

Key Advantages:

Using blockchain for budgeting offers several compelling advantages:

While powerful, implementing blockchain for public budgeting is not without its challenges:

Public administrators who want to use blockchain should first map out the budget lifecycle and find the stages with the most transparency or the biggest risk gaps. These stages include planning, authorization, disbursement, and auditing.

It's a good idea to start with a small pilot, like recording a few budget documents or specific fund lines. Before full-scale deployment, pilots let you test smart contracts, data access, and public engagement.

Picking the right blockchain architecture is very important. Public, permissioned, or hybrid models can help find a balance between privacy and openness. Smart contracts should automatically release funds when certain conditions are met, such as project milestones or audit approvals.

A public portal gives people access to budget information, and auditors and oversight bodies should be involved early on to check it independently. Training staff makes sure that the new system is used correctly, and analytics tools can find problems.

Finally, legal systems should accept records on the blockchain. After a successful pilot, the system can slowly grow to cover more of the budget lifecycle, making things more open and allowing more people to get involved.

Blockchain isn't just a cool piece of technology; when it's used wisely in public financial systems, it can help make things more open, accountable, and trustworthy. Blockchain-based budgeting gives public administrators a chance to rebuild trust with citizens by making budget allocations, payments, and audits easy to check in real time.

Blockchain adoption doesn't happen overnight. It needs careful planning, legal work, working together with stakeholders, and the right technical partners. But the benefits, less corruption, better audits, and more citizen involvement make it worth it. 

Governments like the Philippines and Guinea-Bissau have shown that blockchain can change public finance from closed ledger books to a system that is open, participatory, and strong.

If you're in charge of changing public finance, you might want to start with a small test. For example, you could tokenize important documents, set up a public verification portal, and make smart contracts for spending that only happen when certain conditions are met. 

You can eventually grow into a full-on-chain budget lifecycle, making transparency go from an idea to a real thing that happens on-chain.

 

What is the main advantage of using blockchain in government budgeting?  Blockchain provides an immutable, publicly verifiable ledger of budget documents and disbursements, reducing tampering risk and enabling real-time transparency for citizens and auditors. 

Can smart contracts help automate public fund disbursement?  Yes, Smart contracts can enforce conditions (milestones, invoice submission, audit approval) before funds are released, ensuring budgeted money is used appropriately. 

How has a real government implemented blockchain for budget transparency?  In the Philippines, the Department of Budget and Management records key budget documents (SAROs and NCAs) on Polygon via a blockchain portal, enabling public verification. 

What challenges do public administrators face when implementing blockchain budgeting?  Key challenges include data privacy, building technical infrastructure, navigating legal recognition of on-chain documents, and securing buy-in from stakeholders. 

How can governments balance transparency with confidentiality on a public blockchain? They can adopt permissioned or hybrid blockchains and use protocols (e.g., privacy layers) to restrict sensitive information while keeping transactional data auditable.

For artists, brands, and studios, these intelligent NFT pipelines turn multichain strategy into a configurable workflow rather than a technical hurdle. Creators can design dynamic, behavior-driven NFTs that adapt to usage, time, or on-chain events, then deploy them consistently across networks using the same workspace they rely on for image and video generation. With Colle AI available on both web and iOS, teams can monitor and adjust campaigns, test new drops, and ship collections from anywhere, all while benefiting from automated personalization and scalable publishing infrastructure.

“By putting intelligence into the NFT pipeline itself, Colle AI helps creators move ideas from concept to cross-chain launch faster and with far less complexity,” said J. King Kasr, Chief Scientist at KaJ Labs. “The goal is simple: let creators focus on storytelling and experiences, while the platform quietly handles the multichain heavy lifting in the background.”

NFTs are not just quirky cartoons of apes and anime avatars, argues this new book from Taschen, but an education on the possibility of art, ownership, collecting and trading.

Taschen's new book On NFTs is catching audiences up on the misconstrued idea of non-fungible tokens. At one point, NFTs were a major talking point in the art world, with a sudden well of opportunity opening up for digital artists and budding art collectors. However, artist and author Robert Alice – a trained art historian who most notably co-produced the first academic conference on NFTs at the University of Oxford in 2022 – is challenging the idea that NFTs are purely synonymous with art (a presumption that ignores their surprising 50 year history). Described as a groundbreaking technology, digital art is only the first chapter in its evolution, as Robert makes a compelling case for how NFTs can expand on ideas of ownership and collectables.

“While it can include digital art, it could also include a house (like a paper deed), a baseball card collectible (also on paper) or a tin of Heinz beans if you like,” says Robert. “The low cost, democratic nature of the medium, like paper and the printing press before, has and will continue to usher in a democratising revolution in terms of publishing.” NFTs used to be a bit of a dirty word that would conjure up stereotypical images of kitsch gorilla drawings, pixel characters and anime avatars, but Robert's near 700 page artist-led book is filled with striking and alternative images that could only take place in the virtual world of cryptoart.

Alongside Rutherford Chang, Leander Herzog, Kim Asendorf, Shl0ms, Roope Rainisto and Jack Butcher, the book also includes 60s computer compositions by A. Michael Noll, Rafael Rozendaal's trippy patchwork art recently shown in MoMa, generative WebGL artworks, and Anna Ridler's early and important NFTs, all of which share unique relationships with the digital medium and the act of viewing art through the desktop. NFTs can take all sorts of surprising forms – some look like fine art, classical even, whereas others can look distinctly digital.

“Both Herzog and Asendorf in their own respective ways with Infinite Garden and PXL DEX have created technically complex work that uses the blockchain as a medium to create collaborative works that engage the collector,” says Robert. “Speaking of engaging collectors, Sam Spratt's Monument Game and Butcher's Checks have both continued to express the convergence of game theory within digital art, alongside the idea of collector as co-creator in the work.” Even poets are on the blockchain now, but this informative book destined for your Metaverse coffee-table argues that the concept, which still escapes the public's whole-hearted acceptance, is the future.

“There is no world with AI without NFTs. In a world of exponential synthetic image and video generation, where you can't tell what is real or not, how will you be able to know an image of google is real?” asks Robert. “In a world of AI artists, what system will an AI feel most comfortable with, liaising with a gallery? Or a permissionless blockchain?” With NFT's unique relationship with provable ownership and digital collecting, they can create a space for artists where they have an intimate connection with how their art is distributed, stored, bought and traded, especially as a more sophisticated digital art market has emerged.

In October, while Gilmer celebrated the Yamboree, across the Atlantic, Swansea, Wales became the center of the martial arts universe as athletes from around the globe descended upon the 2025 ICO World Championships—but it was Team USA that stole the show with an unforgettable, history-making performance.

Across four days of intense competition, the United States delivered one of the most dominant displays in ICO history, bringing home an astonishing 164 world titles in forms, weapons, point fighting, continuous sparring, team events, and more.

This wasn't just a victory.

It was a statement.

And standing in the heart of it all was Master Clayton Watkins, coaching alongside some of the greatest martial arts minds in the world.

Coaching on the World Stage

To coach at the ICO World Championships is to stand among an elite class of instructors whose knowledge, insight, and experience shape the global direction of the sport.

This year, Master Clayton Watkins earned his place in that circle.

Representing East Texas and the American sport-martial-arts community, Watkins joined a coaching lineup filled with international icons—champion makers, technical innovators, and long-respected leaders in the field. Shoulder to shoulder with these world-class coaches, he contributed to game-winning strategies, ringside tactics, and athlete preparation throughout the event.

His presence in Wales showcased what his students and peers already know—he is one of the most effective, respected, and influential coaches in the United States today.

164 World Champions — A Nation's Strength on Display

The American performance was nothing short of breathtaking.

Athletes from across the country—from Texas, Florida, California, Oregon, Colorado, Georgia, the Midwest, the Northeast, and beyond—fought with precision, grit, and heart. Every division, every ring, every moment saw Team USA rise to the occasion.

The result:

164 world championships across multiple disciplines, a medal count that stunned countries around the globe and reaffirmed the United States as a powerhouse in international sport karate.

This achievement reflects not just talent, but the unity, preparation, and coaching excellence that drove the team for months leading up to Wales.

A Texas Coach, An International Impact

Though the world stage was bright, East Texas shined with it.

Master Clayton Watkins' contribution extended far beyond corner coaching. He brought leadership, discipline, and an athlete-centered approach that helped competitors stay composed under pressure and execute at the highest level.

His involvement in the world-coaching lineup reinforces a truth the martial-arts community has known for years:

Watkins is part of a new generation of American coaches whose influence reaches far beyond their home schools.

ProComp's fingerprints were felt throughout Team USA's performance. The quality, poise, and professionalism that define Watkins' program echoed across the arena.

A Championship That Will Be Remembered

The 2025 ICO World Championships in Wales will be remembered as a landmark moment—a year when Team USA didn't just participate, but dominated.

And among the voices leading the charge was one from East Texas:

a coach who has devoted his life to building champions in both skill and character.

Clayton Watkins coached among the best in the world—

and proved he belongs there.","{'href': 'https://www.gilmermirror.com', 'title': 'The Gilmer Mirror'}","cryptocurrency"

Almost all traders have caught up quickly with the new trend in town, the EV2 Presale. The numbers are going top of the roof because there are more than enough cherries to grab at just $0.01 for each token.

The idea is straightforward enough. Players join the presale, grab their allocation, and automatically qualify for the giveaway that includes tokens, NFTs, USDT, in-game rewards and a Whopping $500,000 giveaway for early buyers. 

In a sector where most projects struggle to get off the ground, EV2 is already making waves. Its tokenomics are designed to trim the fat and keep players hooked, while the Battle Pass system ensures gamers are getting a big chop of ROI.

With a total supply of 2.88 Billion tokens and a hard cap that stops at 50 million, the tokenomics show a system that tries to keep things balanced instead of letting supply inflate endlessly. Meanwhile 40% also sits in presale allocation which gives a rough idea of where interest is forming. At this moment, nearly $400,000  has already been raised and more than 38M  tokens are in the hands of early participants. 

This is not surprising because the token is driven by profitable utility like storage upgrades, gear crafting, rewards, and marketplace activity. Every time a player earns or spends, the value cycle breathes again, creating a loop where effort can actually matter. Add in the giveaway, and suddenly EV2 looks less like a presale and more like a gold rush.

Fracture is the first game mode that jumps out and not just because it throws twenty five players into frantic free for all combat. The map scatters glowing cubes in three colours and each colour becomes a stepping stone toward a final relic that only one player can claim. It sounds simple but the trick is that death resets your progress and steals do happen when rivals grab the cubes you collected.

The Cloaker suit fits this mode like a glove. Its stealth and invisibility allow players to slip in, grab cubes, and vanish before anyone understands what happened. Fast strikes and hit escape patterns give Cloaker players a small edge in a mode where every second counts. 

This is another interesting mode. Survivor is the lone wolf challenge that forces players to rely on instinct because one mistake can send them right back to the lobby. It is a last man standing format where the environment shifts and demands smart movement more than reckless aggression. 

The Mag suit adds a different flavour to this mode. Its control over cosmic energy lets players heal when battles drag on and strike with hybrid elemental attacks when moments turn critical. This combination makes Mag feel like a flexible choice, especially for players who want a little safety net without playing too slow.

EV2 uses simple systems to keep players active without making things look complicated. Tokens fuel upgrades and storage. Holocrons let players enter high stakes matches for rare rewards. Some future items may arrive as NFTs on the wider Web3 marketplace, although this part still sits in the maybe zone. 

All things considered, EV2 presents itself as a project that tries to merge strong design with easy entry, changing the narrative around Web3 gaming. The presale sets the tone, the giveaway attracts attention, and the structure suggests the game wants to reward skill without hiding the rules. 

The numbers are growing massively in a blink of an eye. It wouldn't be long before traders will feel they have missed out on something great and at a steal price. This is not a phase you should snooze.

Abu Dhabi, UAE, November 17th, 2025, Chainwire



Perpetual DEXs became the real leaders of on-chain trading in 2025. Major perpetual DEXs, like Aster, Lighter, Hyperliquid, and EdgeX, have driven billions in daily derivatives volume, outperforming traditional DEXs and spot exchanges in traders' activity and liquidity. Perpetual DEXs now account for over 40% of total trading volume, according to the recent DefiLlama analysis. All these protocols bring new liquidity, higher gas utilization, and migration of active traders and investors. 

Perpetual DEXs are catalyzing ecosystem growth and DeFi expansion, attracting traders, liquidity providers, developers, and institutional investors. Now, BasePerp, the first Base perpetual DEX, brought institutional interest and investors, announcing its presale. 

BasePerp: The First Perpetual DEX on Base

BasePerp is the first perpetual DEX built specifically for the Base ecosystem. It offers zero-fee trading, up to 100x leverage, and yield options for liquidity providers. Early investors can purchase $BPEP via all major wallets like MetaMask, OKX, Trust, and Coinbase Wallet, and with direct purchase via smart contract. The current $BPERP price is $0.00199.

To join the presale, the investors should open the official BasePerp website, connect a suitable wallet, and choose the purchase method. Only 25% of the total supply (6,400,000,000 BPERP) is allocated for the BasePerp presale, with a 15% TGE unlock to provide stable ecosystem growth after launch. 

How BasePerp Can Become a Trading Hub For Base Chain 

In 2025, Base became one of the fastest-growing Layer-2 chains with its Coinbase integration and DeFi developers' activity. However, the Base network still lacks liquidity drivers and trader inflow from other ecosystems. BasePerp can become a trading hub for the Base chain by bringing on-chain leverage trading and yield-driven liquidity incentives. 

BasePerp architecture integrates Base's low-cost infrastructure with advanced perpetual trading design, providing unique features for Base traders and institutional investors. The BasePerp team plans to provide an open public testnet and mainnet launch by Q2 2026, and it can bring higher on-chain volume, up to 10x daily trading volume growth, with a liquidity boost for DeFi ecosystems on the Base chain. 

$BPERP Utility and Tokenomics





The key to the BasePerp ecosystem is $BPERP – a utility token, which enhances the trading experience and rewards liquidity providers. All $BPERP holders will get priority access to new BasePerp trading features, unique liquidity pools, and specialized analytics and trading tools. Additionally, stakers will be able to activate an incentive boost with transferable XP multipliers that will help to unlock new liquidity rewards. 

The total $BPERP supply is 6.4 billion tokens with steady growth and a transparent allocation structure. The BasePerp tokenomics is designed to accumulate trading volume for the Base ecosystem and provide long-term stability with fair access for investors and traders. While 25% of the total supply is allocated to the public sale, with 15% TGE unlock, the core team and advisors' 16% allocation will have a four-month cliff and a three-year linear vesting schedule. This structure is built to provide long-term commitment and ensure protocol growth. 

BasePerp's on-chain leverage trading, dynamic liquidity pools, and staking systems can significantly boost Base's daily transaction volume, attract professional traders and institutional investors, and expand the Base DeFi ecosystem.  

About BasePerp

BasePerp is a native Base perpetual DEX with advanced AMM features and 100x leverage trading options. It is designed to become a trading hub for Base traders and institutional investors with stable, long-term ecosystem growth.

Last week the UAE Ministry of Finance and Dubai Department of Finance (DOF) announced the execution of the first live government financial transaction using the digital dirham. It leveraged the mBridge platform, a CBDC solution mainly used for cross border payments. The UAE is advancing its CBDC plans across three fronts: wholesale, retail and cross border. This transaction marked the launch of the pilot phase of the wholesale digital dirham project.

“The first pilot Digital Dirham transaction, executed through the government payments platform, mBridge, was conducted to test operational readiness and ensure seamless technical integration with the Central Bank's systems,” said Ahmed Ali Meftah, Executive Director of Central Accounts Sector at DOF. “The transaction was completed in less than two minutes, underscoring its goal of enhancing operational efficiency and expediting financial settlements between federal and local government entities.”

This aligns with one of the primary goals of the CBDC project: to reduce costs and enable near instant settlement for retail, wholesale and cross border transactions. Additionally, the UAE's goal is to improve financial inclusion. In early 2023 the Central Bank of the UAE partnered with R3 to develop both the wholesale CBDC and retail solution using the Corda enterprise blockchain. This recent inter-government payment used the R3 integration between the production wholesale CBDC and mBridge platforms, with the Ministry of Finance describing it as the settlement of government payments “without intermediaries”.

Last week the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) unveiled EnsembleX, the next phase of Project Ensemble for tokenized deposits and tokenization. The pilot phase will run throughout 2026 with real money transactions, unlike the previous iteration which mainly involved simulations or experimental tokenized deposits. The use cases in focus are tokenized deposits and tokenized money market funds for real time treasury management. This will allow companies to move money 24/7 and to switch into yield bearing money market funds in real time when their funds are idle.

Seven banks will be involved in the tokenized deposit trials. They include the three Hong Kong note issuing banks, Bank of China (Hong Kong), HSBC and Standard Chartered. Several commercial firms are also participating in the pilots, including Ant Digital and Ant International, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and HKEX.

While many banks have launched internal tokenized deposit solutions, these only allows clients to move money between branches of the same bank. The key difference with EnsembleX is the ability to execute payments between banks. HSBC was the first to do so as part of EnsembleX, enabling its client Ant International to transfer HKD 3.8 million to another domestic bank.

          Republicans are trying to permanently block central bank digital currencies that would create an alternative to profit-seeking companies.        

Americans who want to transfer money online have options. They can go with services like Venmo and PayPal, make transfers from their personal bank, or do a transaction with stablecoins issued by cryptocurrency companies.

All those options have something in common that may not always occur to consumers: The transfers are offered by exclusively by private companies. That means users' accounts aren't stuffed with physical dollars, but rather with promises made by private companies to make the recipient whole.

Unlike with cash money, the system creates a middleman for every dollar spent — and an opportunity for them to make a profit off the digital equivalent of something so simple as handing someone else a bill.

There's no way to send money digitally without involving a company that has an angle. With cash on the way out — the last penny was just minted, for instance — there is a possible future where every single monetary transaction between people involves private interests.

The little-noted distinction raises a question: Why can't the actual backer of the dollar — the U.S. government — create a way to send money itself? Academics have been exploring this question for years, asking why the federal government can't back its own digital currency to facilitate transfers between people.

A system with a central bank digital currency, as it's known, could operate as a public good, advocates say, with potentially zero or minimal transaction fees — just by letting the government take a small step from backing physical currency to backing its digital equivalent.

In the U.S., those researchers never got past an exploratory phase, but that did not stop a central bank digital currency from becoming a boogeyman for right-wing activists.

The Republican House majority whip, Rep. Tom Emmer, warned that the Chinese Communist Party uses a digital currency to spy on its citizens. Online memes dubbed them a “mark of the beast.” Donald Trump promised to ban them last year, and followed through with an executive order in January.

Now, Republicans are trying to make sure that no matter who is president, private companies will forever hold the monopoly on Americans sending money to each other online.

The bill would even prevent research on government-issued digital currencies.

They're pushing a formal, codified ban that would squash government competition to private payments before it ever gets started. The House included a central bank digital currency ban in its version of a defense budget bill, which will be hashed out with the Senate in the coming weeks. The bill would even prevent research on government-issued digital currencies.

The debate raises major questions about privacy, public goods, the dollar's dominant position of the global economy, and technological innovation. That debate's resolution, one prominent researcher told The Intercept, will determine the future of money.

“Right now, the only way to digitally transact through people is through a private sector intermediary — whether that's a bank or a fintech company or a credit card company,” said Neha Narula, the director of the digital currency initiative at the MIT Media Lab who from 2020 to 2022 worked with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to explore the idea. “It is not really clear that that structure continues to work without something like cash, users having the ability to exit to cash.”

To understand the potential upsides, it is possible to look to the handful of other countries where central bank digital currencies have already been adopted. In the Bahamas, citizens can use smartphone apps or plastic cards to make fee-free purchases and transfers with the digital Bahamian dollar.

The adoption of digital currency in the Bahamas has been low, in part because so many private alternatives already exist. A similar pattern has emerged in China, which launched a digital currency in 2020.

In the long term, China hopes to use digital currency to leapfrog past the U.S. dollar's role as the preeminent mode of international exchange. American boosters of central bank digital currencies, such as former President Joe Biden, say it is important that the U.S. not get left behind. China's preeminence in the field is a red flag for the likes of Emmer, however, the Republican in House leadership.

“The digital yuan, Major, is a financial surveillance tool,” he told CBS News' Major Garrett in an interview earlier this year. “The Chinese Communist Party is literally building social scores on its citizens based on their purchases. This is not an American value.”

Narula, the researcher, acknowledged that the use cases for digital dollars may be elusive for now. Still, she believes that it is important to keep studying central bank digital currencies, given the inevitable trend toward more digital transactions.

She said, “It is hard to imagine in 50 or 100 years we are going to be using pieces of paper.”

Narula is adamant that a central bank digital currency could be built with privacy protection at its core. After all, there are already cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin that allow their users to remain mostly anonymous.

Digital currency critics, by contrast, paint them as Orwellian tools of government oversight. One skeptic argued that privacy protections would be too vulnerable to the whims of an administration.

“It is technically possible to achieve privacy, but it's not politically possible to achieve privacy. And that's a very important point to stress here,” said Nicholas Anthony, an analyst with the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. “Once a crisis occurs, it would be so easy to have privacy protections ripped away.”

Anthony said those on the left should be just as concerned as those on the right about the potential for abuse.

“Our financial transactions reveal so much about us,” he said. “Anyone in power can really use it to their advantage. So it's really unfortunate, in my eyes, that it has become a ‘Republican' or ‘conservative' issue.”

 

Private offerings come with a host of privacy concerns as well, Anthony acknowledged. He argued that the market will incentivize privacy protections, along the lines of Apple's marketing on the topic. Others aren't so sure and think the issue may be operating as a smokescreen for private companies.

“You hear a lot of high-minded rhetoric about CBDCs being a threat to people or privacy, but at the end of the day, this is really about what roles the public and private sector play in finance,” said Mark Hays, an advocate with the left-leaning groups Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress.

By banning even government research on central bank digital currencies, MIT Media Lab's Narula warned, the legislation also risks endangering further progress on privacy protections.

“There's certain experience that only people in government have when it comes to administrating our monetary system,” she said. “So to cut them off from participating in this research means that we are not going to get to the best outcomes, because we don't have the best minds working on it.”

If a ban comes to pass, the field of digital payments will be left wide open for private industry. That could present a profitable market opportunity for financial services companies and cryptocurrency startups.

The stablecoin industry already has a market capitalization of over $300 billion, and it is poised to explode in the wake of recent legislation supported by Trump, himself a stablecoin entrepreneur.

 

In fact, cryptocurrency companies have been some of the most vociferous opponents of central bank digital currencies after initially exploring partnerships with the U.S. government on them. Critics point out that government-issued digital dollars could compete with stablecoins, which earn profit for their private issuers from the interest on U.S. bonds and other securities backing consumer accounts.

Hays said that he recognized the privacy concerns that come with government-issued digital currencies.

“My dollar that I lay down at the bodega, chances are that's not going to be on any database. But with the CBDC, in a certain way of thinking about it, it now would be,” he said.

“Your HUD grant would be brought to you by Circle or Tether.”

Still, he worries that private interests are moving to take control of financial infrastructure that should belong to the public. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is already exploring the use of blockchain to monitor the billions of dollars in grants it pays out every year, he noted.

“Your HUD grant would be brought to you by Circle or Tether,” said Hays, referring to two cryptocurrency companies. “How far they get is anybody's guess, but the fact that they are floating it gives you a signal of their intentions. They would like to see a world where that fundamental architecture — which we would argue needs to be democratically controlled — is another way of putting more of that system under private control, including crypto.”

IT'S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT.

What we're seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. 

This is not hyperbole.

Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation.

Yet far too many are still covering Trump's assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” 

The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy.

          Republicans are trying to permanently block central bank digital currencies that would create an alternative to profit-seeking companies.        

Americans who want to transfer money online have options. They can go with services like Venmo and PayPal, make transfers from their personal bank, or do a transaction with stablecoins issued by cryptocurrency companies.

All those options have something in common that may not always occur to consumers: The transfers are offered by exclusively by private companies. That means users' accounts aren't stuffed with physical dollars, but rather with promises made by private companies to make the recipient whole.

Unlike with cash money, the system creates a middleman for every dollar spent — and an opportunity for them to make a profit off the digital equivalent of something so simple as handing someone else a bill.

There's no way to send money digitally without involving a company that has an angle. With cash on the way out — the last penny was just minted, for instance — there is a possible future where every single monetary transaction between people involves private interests.

The little-noted distinction raises a question: Why can't the actual backer of the dollar — the U.S. government — create a way to send money itself? Academics have been exploring this question for years, asking why the federal government can't back its own digital currency to facilitate transfers between people.

A system with a central bank digital currency, as it's known, could operate as a public good, advocates say, with potentially zero or minimal transaction fees — just by letting the government take a small step from backing physical currency to backing its digital equivalent.

In the U.S., those researchers never got past an exploratory phase, but that did not stop a central bank digital currency from becoming a boogeyman for right-wing activists.

The Republican House majority whip, Rep. Tom Emmer, warned that the Chinese Communist Party uses a digital currency to spy on its citizens. Online memes dubbed them a “mark of the beast.” Donald Trump promised to ban them last year, and followed through with an executive order in January.

Now, Republicans are trying to make sure that no matter who is president, private companies will forever hold the monopoly on Americans sending money to each other online.

The bill would even prevent research on government-issued digital currencies.

They're pushing a formal, codified ban that would squash government competition to private payments before it ever gets started. The House included a central bank digital currency ban in its version of a defense budget bill, which will be hashed out with the Senate in the coming weeks. The bill would even prevent research on government-issued digital currencies.

The debate raises major questions about privacy, public goods, the dollar's dominant position of the global economy, and technological innovation. That debate's resolution, one prominent researcher told The Intercept, will determine the future of money.

“Right now, the only way to digitally transact through people is through a private sector intermediary — whether that's a bank or a fintech company or a credit card company,” said Neha Narula, the director of the digital currency initiative at the MIT Media Lab who from 2020 to 2022 worked with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to explore the idea. “It is not really clear that that structure continues to work without something like cash, users having the ability to exit to cash.”

To understand the potential upsides, it is possible to look to the handful of other countries where central bank digital currencies have already been adopted. In the Bahamas, citizens can use smartphone apps or plastic cards to make fee-free purchases and transfers with the digital Bahamian dollar.

The adoption of digital currency in the Bahamas has been low, in part because so many private alternatives already exist. A similar pattern has emerged in China, which launched a digital currency in 2020.

In the long term, China hopes to use digital currency to leapfrog past the U.S. dollar's role as the preeminent mode of international exchange. American boosters of central bank digital currencies, such as former President Joe Biden, say it is important that the U.S. not get left behind. China's preeminence in the field is a red flag for the likes of Emmer, however, the Republican in House leadership.

“The digital yuan, Major, is a financial surveillance tool,” he told CBS News' Major Garrett in an interview earlier this year. “The Chinese Communist Party is literally building social scores on its citizens based on their purchases. This is not an American value.”

Narula, the researcher, acknowledged that the use cases for digital dollars may be elusive for now. Still, she believes that it is important to keep studying central bank digital currencies, given the inevitable trend toward more digital transactions.

She said, “It is hard to imagine in 50 or 100 years we are going to be using pieces of paper.”

Narula is adamant that a central bank digital currency could be built with privacy protection at its core. After all, there are already cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin that allow their users to remain mostly anonymous.

Digital currency critics, by contrast, paint them as Orwellian tools of government oversight. One skeptic argued that privacy protections would be too vulnerable to the whims of an administration.

“It is technically possible to achieve privacy, but it's not politically possible to achieve privacy. And that's a very important point to stress here,” said Nicholas Anthony, an analyst with the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. “Once a crisis occurs, it would be so easy to have privacy protections ripped away.”

Anthony said those on the left should be just as concerned as those on the right about the potential for abuse.

“Our financial transactions reveal so much about us,” he said. “Anyone in power can really use it to their advantage. So it's really unfortunate, in my eyes, that it has become a ‘Republican' or ‘conservative' issue.”

 

Private offerings come with a host of privacy concerns as well, Anthony acknowledged. He argued that the market will incentivize privacy protections, along the lines of Apple's marketing on the topic. Others aren't so sure and think the issue may be operating as a smokescreen for private companies.

“You hear a lot of high-minded rhetoric about CBDCs being a threat to people or privacy, but at the end of the day, this is really about what roles the public and private sector play in finance,” said Mark Hays, an advocate with the left-leaning groups Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress.

By banning even government research on central bank digital currencies, MIT Media Lab's Narula warned, the legislation also risks endangering further progress on privacy protections.

“There's certain experience that only people in government have when it comes to administrating our monetary system,” she said. “So to cut them off from participating in this research means that we are not going to get to the best outcomes, because we don't have the best minds working on it.”

If a ban comes to pass, the field of digital payments will be left wide open for private industry. That could present a profitable market opportunity for financial services companies and cryptocurrency startups.

The stablecoin industry already has a market capitalization of over $300 billion, and it is poised to explode in the wake of recent legislation supported by Trump, himself a stablecoin entrepreneur.

 

In fact, cryptocurrency companies have been some of the most vociferous opponents of central bank digital currencies after initially exploring partnerships with the U.S. government on them. Critics point out that government-issued digital dollars could compete with stablecoins, which earn profit for their private issuers from the interest on U.S. bonds and other securities backing consumer accounts.

Hays said that he recognized the privacy concerns that come with government-issued digital currencies.

“My dollar that I lay down at the bodega, chances are that's not going to be on any database. But with the CBDC, in a certain way of thinking about it, it now would be,” he said.

“Your HUD grant would be brought to you by Circle or Tether.”

Still, he worries that private interests are moving to take control of financial infrastructure that should belong to the public. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is already exploring the use of blockchain to monitor the billions of dollars in grants it pays out every year, he noted.

“Your HUD grant would be brought to you by Circle or Tether,” said Hays, referring to two cryptocurrency companies. “How far they get is anybody's guess, but the fact that they are floating it gives you a signal of their intentions. They would like to see a world where that fundamental architecture — which we would argue needs to be democratically controlled — is another way of putting more of that system under private control, including crypto.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","About The Coin Laundry investigation","https://www.icij.org/investigations/coin-laundry/about-coin-laundry-investigation-cryptocurrency/","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 05:01:26 GMT","

The investigation reveals how crypto companies profited from crime while victims were financially ruined.

The Coin Laundry exposes how cryptocurrency companies have empowered a shadow economy that lavishly profits from crime.

Led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, The Coin Laundry is a groundbreaking cross-border investigation that reveals how many of these companies make money off the proceeds of scams, theft and other crimes — while those who've lost their savings or livelihoods are left with little hope of justice.

Over 10 months of reporting, ICIJ and 37 media partners in 35 countries gathered hundreds of cryptocurrency wallet addresses — analogous to bank account numbers — linked to known illicit activity. Journalists collected them from scam victims, police reports, court records, sanctions lists, complaints filed with Seychelles' financial regulator and from test transactions with crypto services, among other sources.

Reporters then disentangled tens of thousands of transactions recorded across public blockchains — the digital ledgers of crypto trades — to expose the global financial flows behind money laundering networks, cyber heists and other criminal enterprises. Journalists interviewed dozens of scam victims across 12 countries and followed their crypto transfers to some of the world's largest exchanges. ICIJ and its partners worked with more than two dozen blockchain analysts to review and verify the findings.

 

The Coin Laundry found that money launderers for drug traffickers and Southeast Asian scam center operators and North Korean hackers used brand-name exchanges to move their funds.

A trailblazing analysis by ICIJ revealed that as recently as July 2025, Huione Group, a Cambodian financial institution flagged by U.S. authorities two months earlier as a “primary money laundering concern,” sent about a million dollars worth of the digital currency tether a day to accounts at Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. In total, ICIJ's review uncovered more than $408 million flowing from Huione to customer accounts at Binance from July 2024 to July 2025.

Hundreds of millions of dollars flowed from Huione into Binance customer accounts while the company was under the supervision of two court-appointed monitors. The monitors were part of Binance's November 2023 plea deal for violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion, one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history.

The analysis found that at least $226 million also flowed into customer accounts at OKX, another major cryptocurrency exchange, from Huione during the five months after OKX pleaded guilty in the U.S. in February to operating an unlicensed money transmitter. OKX agreed to pay more than $504 million in penalties. The transfers from Huione continued after its May designation as a “primary money laundering concern.”

The Coin Laundry also examined a shadowy constellation of so-called cash desks and courier services that allow people to anonymously cash out huge sums of cryptocurrency outside the view of financial regulators. Found in Hong Kong, Toronto, London, Istanbul and other cities, they are a new and largely unpoliced hotspot for laundering money.

To uncover the use of cryptocurrency to supersize scams, ICIJ and its partners examined an alleged pyramid and Ponzi scheme that stiffed victims all over the world. Its mastermind, Vladimir Okhotnikov, 47, is accused of using a rigged cryptocurrency investment platform to steal at least $340 million from investors between 2020 and 2022.

U.S. prosecutors indicted Okhotnikov in 2023 over the alleged scam, but he remains free in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where he continues launching similar schemes, promoted with flashy celebrity-studded events, social media campaigns, and a film co-written by Okhotnikov and directed by Oscar winner Kevin Spacey, set to be released in December.

Cryptocurrency boosters say digital coins and tokens are easier to monitor than government-issued money because transactions are recorded on a blockchain. But complex crypto transactions can be hard for authorities to act on because many pass through anonymous digital wallets. Tools like “swappers” —  software that lets users automatically switch cryptocurrencies without identity checks — can also increase the difficulty of tracing.

The resources required to accurately trace transactions make the task difficult for both crypto trading platforms and law enforcement. More than a dozen former compliance workers at major exchanges, including OKX and Binance, told ICIJ and its partner The Toronto Star that they could hardly keep pace with savvy criminals.

In theory, it's the job of regulators around the world to make sure crypto firms are meeting their legal obligations to combat money laundering. But in practice, a patchwork of laws and fragmented enforcement efforts often mean less government oversight for an industry where the largest actors facilitated tens of trillions of dollars in trading volume last year.

An ICIJ analysis shows that authorities around the world have levied at least $5.8 billion in fines, penalties and settlements so far against cryptocurrency trading platforms, also known as exchanges. Meanwhile, crypto-related losses for consumers and businesses are mounting. In the U.S. alone, the FBI estimates Americans lost $9.3 billion to crypto crimes in 2024, a 67% increase from 2023. That's roughly half the amount criminal financier Bernie Madoff collected from investors in his four-decades-long Ponzi scheme.

Many of those on the cybercrime front lines say they lack the training to trace stolen cryptocurrency. And even those who do, like Alona Katz, chief of the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office's Virtual Currency Unit, are rarely able to recover lost funds for victims partly because the suspected scammers are often in countries beyond their jurisdiction. Katz has had to explain this to victims.

“It's more devastating than I can even put a word on,” she said. “I have spoken to people in their 80s who are preparing to file bankruptcy for the first time … young adults who thought they were helping their family and emptied out the family's common bank account.

“When you are the bearer of the bad news, that everything they have worked for their entire lives, their entire life was gone in the blink of an eye, I mean, there are no good words.”

The Coin Laundry's deep dive into the ways criminals exploit the mechanisms and vulnerabilities of decentralized finance comes at a critical time in the global debate over how to stanch the flow of dirty money in cryptocurrency. Governments worldwide have struggled to adapt. Consumer protection and transparency rules took effect in Europe at the end of 2024, but advocates say they don't do enough to protect users. In the U.S., President Donald Trump has overseen a rollback of enforcement actions against the crypto industry, including his October pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who served time in federal prison after he and his company pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering laws.

Crypto exchange companies in Canada are evading finance laws by offering to buy thousands of dollars in digital currencies without proper registration or without checking ID. And two international platforms contacted by an undercover journalist proposed to deliver as much as $1 million in cash to a location in Montreal in exchange for cryptocurrency.  

Canada has long had a problem with dirty money in its traditional economy, whether it be in banking, casinos or real estate, but the advent of storefront and online cryptocurrency services and a lack of strong regulation and enforcement are blasting open new frontiers for laundering and illicit finance, experts say.

Cryptocurrencies are decentralized by nature, making it difficult for police or fraud victims to identify who is behind millions of transactions in digital currencies like bitcoin, ethereum or tether. But investigators can still track initial purchases of digital coins, or when potential fraudsters offload those coins into hard currency.  

But the idea that anyone, from drug cartels to would-be terrorist plotters, can use a crypto-to-cash service to wire cryptocurrency to a foreign, unregulated digital wallet and then go collect tens of thousands of dollars in cash anonymously somewhere in town — or the reverse — strips away the controls at the blockchain's on- and off-ramps.  

""If you have this way to move money with absolutely zero checks on it, you're facilitating an unlimited amount of crime,"" said Richard Sanders, one of the world's foremost experts on the kinds of crypto-to-cash operations that have cropped up across Canada and around the world. 

""I could not have in my worst dreams predicted the reality we're in now.""

Nick Smart, the chief intelligence officer at Crystal, a company that sells tools to help investigate crypto crimes, said the amount of money being pushed through crypto-to-cash services is ""absolutely staggering."" Last year alone, crypto-to-cash businesses in Hong Kong processed at least $2.5 billion US in transactions, his team found. They're ""a perfect place to operate as a criminal because no one's going to ask any questions,"" he said.

To test how easy it would be to find such a service in Canada, Radio-Canada and CBC News partnered with the Toronto Star and La Presse, as part of a global reporting effort called The Coin Laundry from the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. 

On a recent afternoon, a woman dressed in grey jeans and a brown leather jacket stepped into a money transfer business in midtown Toronto. It was no fly-by-night operation: The company is registered with FINTRAC, Canada's national financial-intelligence agency, and its storefront is one of a dozen branches the company has in three provinces.   

""Hi, I'm here for pickup,"" the woman said. 

""Do you have token?"" the teller behind the glass asked. 

""Here,"" the customer said, showing a Canadian $5 bill and its serial number.

The employee checked her phone for a photo of the same bill that the customer had previously sent via the messenger app Telegram, when setting up the transaction. That $5 bill was the only verification she needed to make sure it was the right person to hand over $1,900 US in cash to — which she promptly did, in $100 bills, from a drawer under the counter.

Undercover journalist visits money exchange for anonymous cash handover

The customer — in reality, an undercover reporter for the Toronto Star wearing a hidden camera and being filmed by Radio-Canada from across the street — exited with the money. A few hours before, she had transferred 2,000 tokens of tether to a Ukraine-based crypto exchange, 001k, which directed her via Telegram messages to the Toronto address to pick up the cash. 

It is illegal under Canada's anti-laundering regulations for a money transfer business to remit $1,000 or more, including from cryptocurrencies, to someone without recording the recipient's personal information and details about all the accounts involved in the transaction. It is also illegal for 001k to do business with Canadians because it's not registered with FINTRAC.

""They shouldn't be doing that. That's actually illegal,"" Joseph Iuso, the executive director of the Canadian Money Services Business Association, said of the Toronto transaction. 

The rules are in place, among other reasons, to try to make crime less profitable by impeding perpetrators from having freewheeling use of the proceeds of their offences.   

When contacted about the exchange, the midtown money transfer business said a rogue manager arranged the transaction off the company's books and in violation of their rules. Reached by email, the manager said that it was his own cash, ""earned legally,"" and that the teller at the front counter ""only did what I asked her to do; she had no knowledge of the situation."" 

Iuso said FINTRAC doesn't have the resources to properly oversee all 2,600-plus money-services businesses registered in Canada, let alone to police unregistered ones. So ""there's just tons"" of foreign money transfer businesses illicitly offering services to Canadians. ""They're all trying to circumvent the regulations. And, unfortunately, how do you police that?""

One web directory lists more than 20 services for converting crypto into cash in cities across the country, from Halifax to Vancouver, none of them registered with FINTRAC. 

Contacted anonymously by reporters for the Toronto Star, a handful of the Toronto-based services said they wouldn't ask for any ID. Meanwhile in Quebec, a journalist for La Presse entered into his own anonymous discussions with 001k and another crypto-to-cash service that said they could deliver $1 million and $890,000 Cdn, respectively, to locations in Montreal in exchange for sending them tether to specific crypto wallets. The services also never asked for any ID.     

It wasn't clear where those other offers would direct the customers to go pick up their cash — the location is only revealed once digital money is sent.  

FINTRAC would not answer questions about the undercover crypto-for-cash transaction or whether it's aware that such services are being offered across Canada by entities like 001k. 

""FINTRAC is prepared to take strong action as necessary so that businesses take their responsibilities seriously,"" it said in a statement. ""That can include administrative monetary penalties and referrals of any non-compliance to law enforcement.""

001k did not answer questions from reporters. Since August 2022, it has been on the receiving end of more than $14.8 billion US in cryptocurrency transfers, according to data provided to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists by crypto forensics firm Chainalysis. 

""Welcome to the Wild West,"" said Sanders, the expert on crypto-to-cash operations. ""This is a way to move money with absolutely zero checks.""

Traditional stock exchanges have always been seen as the backbone of global finance. They are places where companies raise money, investors trade stocks, and financial markets create value. For decades, stock exchanges operated in a familiar world of brokers, regulations, trading floors, and well-defined processes. But things are changing very quickly.

Today, one of the biggest shifts in finance is the rise of cryptocurrency trading. What started as a niche market run by small, tech-focused startups is now attracting the attention of global stock exchanges. Big exchanges that once focused only on stocks and bonds are now exploring digital assets. And one of the fastest and safest ways for them to enter the crypto market is through white label exchange solutions.

This article explains why traditional stock exchanges want to enter the crypto trading space, how white label exchanges help them launch faster, what challenges they face, and what the future could look like as crypto and traditional finance come together.

Crypto trading has grown at a massive pace over the last ten years. What started with Bitcoin has expanded into thousands of digital assets including tokens, stablecoins, utility coins, and digital securities. Global trading volumes sometimes match or even exceed traditional stock markets on busy days.

Stock exchanges see this trend and understand that digital assets are becoming a permanent part of the global financial landscape. Here are the main reasons why they want to enter the crypto arena.

1. New Revenue Opportunities

Crypto trading platforms make money through trading fees, listing fees, institutional services, custody services, and more. For stock exchanges, this opens a new source of income without changing their basic business model. Crypto also brings trading activity 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which means steady revenue every day.

2. Growing Customer Demand

More investors are adding crypto to their portfolios. Even traditional investors who previously avoided digital assets are now exploring them. Younger users prefer digital assets and trade through mobile apps. If stock exchanges do not offer crypto services, these users might move to independent crypto platforms, reducing the exchange's relevance.

3. Ability to Stay Competitive

Financial markets move fast. New trading platforms and fintech companies keep entering the market. If stock exchanges stay limited to traditional stocks, they risk falling behind. Offering crypto trading helps them stay modern and competitive.

4. Institutional Adoption of Crypto

Banks, hedge funds, and large investors are slowly entering the crypto space. These institutions trust regulated stock exchanges more than small, unregulated crypto startups. If stock exchanges offer crypto services, institutions are more likely to invest through them.

5. Future Growth of Tokenization

Many financial experts believe that real estate, bonds, art, gold, and even company shares will be tokenized in the future. Stock exchanges want to be prepared for this shift. Launching a crypto exchange today helps them become ready for wider digital asset trading tomorrow.

Building a crypto exchange from scratch is very complex and time-consuming. It requires a strong tech team, advanced security systems, compliance tools, testing frameworks, and constant updates. For a stock exchange, this can take years and cost millions.

This is where white label exchanges come in.

A white label exchange is a ready-made crypto trading platform that can be customized with the stock exchange's own branding, features, and design. It is like buying a fully built product and adjusting it to your needs rather than building it entirely from zero.

Here are the main reasons stock exchanges choose white label crypto exchanges.

1. Faster Launch

A white label platform can be launched within weeks instead of waiting years to develop a new one. This allows stock exchanges to enter the crypto market quickly and start attracting users before their competitors.

2. Lower Development Costs

Building a crypto exchange from the ground up can cost millions of dollars. White label exchanges cost much less because the development work is already done. The stock exchange only pays for customization, licensing, and ongoing support.

3. Built-In Security

Security is the most important part of any exchange. White label platforms come with features like multi-layer encryption, two-factor authentication, cold storage for funds, and advanced fraud detection. This saves stock exchanges the stress of building and testing security systems on their own.

4. Ready Compliance Tools

Crypto is a regulated industry. Exchanges must follow rules such as KYC, AML, data reporting, user verification, and transaction monitoring. White label exchanges include all these compliance tools, helping stock exchanges meet regulatory requirements from day one.

5. Scalability

As user numbers grow, the platform must handle more transactions per second. White label solutions are designed to scale easily, which helps stock exchanges support millions of users without downtime.

6. Custom Features

Stock exchanges can add features that match their brand quality. This includes custom dashboards, trading tools, mobile apps, APIs for institutions, staking, payments integration, and more.

When a stock exchange decides to launch a white label crypto exchange, the process usually follows these steps.

Step 1: Requirement Analysis

The exchange shares its needs, such as trading types, supported currencies, security preferences, compliance rules, and branding guidelines.

Step 2: Customization

Developers customize the platform with logos, UI design, color themes, trading tools, and region-specific rules.

Step 3: Blockchain Integration

The platform is connected to blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. This allows users to deposit, trade, and withdraw digital assets.

Step 4: Security Setup

Critical security features like multi-signature wallets, DDoS protection, encryption layers, and cold wallet storage are added.

Step 5: Testing

The platform undergoes testing for performance, security, scalability, and compliance. Test trading environments help identify issues.

Step 6: Launch

Once everything is ready, the exchange launches its crypto trading services with full customer support.

Step 7: Post Launch Support

The development team provides updates, bug fixes, new features, and security patches to keep the exchange running smoothly.

Many well-known exchanges have already stepped into the crypto world. Here are some examples.

1. Nasdaq

Nasdaq provides crypto technology to other platforms and has partnered with several crypto firms for market surveillance tools.

2. SIX Swiss Exchange

SIX launched a digital asset trading platform for crypto and security tokens. It supports both trading and settlement.

3. London Stock Exchange Group

The London Stock Exchange has announced plans to create a digital asset marketplace that follows strict regulations.

4. Deutsche Börse

This German exchange has invested in crypto custody providers and technology firms working in digital assets.

5. Singapore Exchange

SGX has actively partnered with blockchain companies and is exploring ways to offer tokenized securities trading.

These examples show a clear trend: stock exchanges know that crypto is not temporary. It is becoming a large and important part of global finance.

Even with white label solutions, stock exchanges still face several challenges when entering the crypto market.

1. Regulatory Uncertainty

Crypto regulations change constantly. Exchanges must keep up with new rules in every region they serve. Some countries restrict certain types of tokens or require extra licenses.

2. Volatility

Crypto prices can change very quickly. Exchanges must protect users and maintain stable operations even during market crashes or extreme trading volume.

3. Cybersecurity

Crypto platforms are big targets for hackers. Stock exchanges must ensure complete protection and be ready for new cyber threats.

4. Public Trust

Although interest in crypto is growing, some users still think crypto is risky. Stock exchanges must educate users, share transparent information, and build trust.

5. Technology Upgrades

Crypto technology evolves rapidly. Exchanges must keep updating their systems to stay competitive.

As crypto becomes more integrated with traditional finance, the role of stock exchanges will continue to grow. Here are some future trends.

1. Tokenized Stocks

Companies may start issuing digital tokens instead of traditional shares. This will allow faster settlements, lower costs, and global access.

2. Unified Trading Platforms

We may soon see platforms where users can trade stocks, crypto, commodities, and tokenized assets in one place.

3. More Institutional Adoption

Banks, investment firms, and pension funds will become more active in crypto once they see regulated exchanges offering reliable services.

4. Growth of Stablecoins and Digital Currencies

Central Bank Digital Currencies may become part of trading platforms, offering faster and safer transactions.

5. Cross Border Trading

Crypto allows global trading without the need for multiple banking systems. Stock exchanges can become global trading hubs for digital assets.

The entry of stock exchanges into the crypto market is a major turning point for global finance. It shows that digital assets are moving from the crypto community into the mainstream world. White label exchange solutions help stock exchanges start this journey quickly, safely, and cost effectively. As more traditional exchanges explore digital assets, we will see a financial system that is more open, modern, and accessible to people everywhere. This transformation will continue in the coming years, and it will be shaped by innovation in white label crypto exchange development.

How does it work?

Starting crypto trading with confidence begins with a solid foundation. New traders should start by educating themselves on how blockchain, exchanges, and wallets work, then choose a reputable trading platform with strong security measures. It's important to invest only what you can afford to lose, begin with small amounts, and diversify rather than placing all funds into a single asset. Using risk-management tools such as stop-loss orders, dollar-cost averaging, and maintaining a long-term strategy also helps stabilize returns. Keeping emotions in check—avoiding fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) or panic selling—is equally crucial for consistent performance.
To minimize risks further, partnering with a trusted service like ChainCapital dot us can make a significant difference. ChainCapital(.)us integrates advanced security protocols, real-time market analytics, and automated risk-control features that help protect traders from volatility and fraudulent activity. Its platform uses AI-driven insights to guide decision-making, while its custodial safeguards and multi-layer encryption protect user funds from unauthorized access. With professional support, transparent operations, and built-in risk-management tools, ChainCapital enables both beginners and experienced traders to navigate the crypto market with greater confidence and reduced exposure to potential losses.

Over the past week the number of unique entities holding at least 1,000 BTC has climbed to 1,436 even as bitcoin has tumbled and held firmly below $100,000.

This marks a sharp reversal from the broader 2025 trend where ""OGs"" and long term participants have been steady net sellers. 

For context, this cohort peaked above 1,500 entities in November 2024 in the excitement and bull move following Donald Trump's election victory. It declined to about 1,300 in October.

The last time a price rally was seen with a rise in large holder entities was in January 2024, ahead of the U.S. ETF launch, when the number rose from 1,380 to 1,512 entities. Bitcoin ultimately topped out around $70,000 a couple of months later.

Further evidence supports this from the Accumulation Trend Score by Glassnode which breaks down wallet cohort behavior.

This metric measures the relative strength of coin acquisition across different balance tiers based on entity size and the volume of coins accumulated over the past fifteen days. A reading near one indicates accumulation, while a reading near zero indicates distribution. Entities such as exchanges and miners are excluded.

For the first time since August, whales holding more than 10,000 BTC are no longer heavy sellers, with their score now around 0.5. Entities holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC are now showing modest accumulation.

The strongest accumulation comes from holders with 100 to 1,000 BTC and from wallets holding less than 1 BTC. The data suggests growing conviction from both large and small entities that bitcoin is undervalued at current levels.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), the digital asset treasury firm focused on Ethereum, said on Monday it acquired over 54,000 ether ETH$3,076.78 last week worth around $173 million at current prices.

The firm now holds nearly 3.6 million ETH, closing in on 3% of the outstanding supply of the token, alongside a small bitcoin stash and equity in Worldcoin-focused treasury firm Eightco (ORBS). It also raised its cash holdings to $607 million, up from $398 million last week.

BMNR shares slipped 2.6% on Monday to their weakest level since August.

BitMine chairman and Fundstrat co-founder Thomas Lee attributed the current weakness in crypto prices to a sharp drop in liquidity, possibly caused by a wounded market maker pulling back operations following the October 10 crash.

""When a market maker has a 'hole' on their balance sheet, they are seeking to raise capital and are reducing their liquidity functions in the market, Lee said, likening the situation to a kind of ""quantitative tightening"" (QT) for crypto assets. ""In 2022, this QT effect lasted for 6-8 weeks,"" he said.

Despite the current downturn, BitMine does not believe crypto has reached a cycle peak yet, Lee said. In his November note to shareholders, he argued that structural drivers could push the cycle's top into 2026 or later. He also pointed to asset tokenization such as stocks, bonds and real estate on the Ethereum blockchain as a key trend to watch, calling it ""a major unlock"" for the financial system.

The cryptocurrency market is in a mixed mood, with some recent outperformers facing pressure while major cryptocurrencies remain resilient. Privacy-focused coins monero XMR$410,56 and zcash ZEC$682,09 fell more than 4% in the last 24 hours, contrasting with relatively stable trading in bitcoin BTC$92.886,63, ether ETH$3.076,78, XRP$2,1692, solana SOL$132,63, and others that have bounced back from late Sunday lows.

Notably, the CoinDesk DeFi Select and Smart Contract Select Indices are showing strength, up roughly 5% and 4% respectively since early Asian trading hours, underscoring pockets of growth amid broader caution.

Zcash which, in a rare bright spot against the wider market despondency, has surged over 500% since September, is now teasing a bearish double top pattern (see the Technical Analysis section below). Whether a decline in ZEC heralds a bounce in BTC and ETH — in continuation of diverging trends with majors — remains to be seen. 

Hot analysts' takes about how we are still early in terms of institutional adoption, and how incoming inflows could lift valuations sky-high, continued to do the rounds, offering hope to battered BTC bulls.

In other development, Arca's CIO Jeff Dorman dismissed speculation about Strategy (MSTR) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor liquidating his BTC holdings, noting that Saylor's financial position would likely shield him from selling unless bitcoin's value collapsed precipitously.

Ryan Lee, the chief analyst at Bitget urged traders to monitor U.S. regulatory developments, particularly around exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stablecoin payment frameworks and exchange oversight. These could swiftly shift investor sentiment back to a risk-on stance, Lee said. 

In traditional markets, Japanese longer-dated government bond yields surged in response to reports that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's first stimulus package may include spending worth roughly 17 trillion yen ($110 billion). 

With the country's debt-to-GDP ratio already among the highest globally at 240%, such a move could flood the market with bonds and push yields higher, bolstering the risk of a fiscal crisis. For crypto traders, rising Japanese yields may pressure Treasury bonds, pushing yields higher, and weigh on risk assets like tech stocks and digital currencies. Stay alert!

How Influential People Map Their Social World

The same brain areas that help us map physical space help us chart social connections, and the best relationship cartographers have most clout

By Oriel FeldmanHall edited by Daisy Yuhas

What do social climbers and gossipmongers have in common? My mother would tell me that both are morally suspect. This moral umbrage is etched into lessons from fairy tales and scripture that we readily pass on to our children: Avoid the schemer and the whisperer.

But stories are known to simplify reality. The truth is that that the most effective gossipers and social climbers possess a remarkable grasp of social structure, knowledge they use to cleverly navigate their social worlds. This skill isn't a moral failing; it's a cognitive feat. Our minds are sophisticated engines that mentally map our social landscapes. Who's close to whom? Who belongs to which group? Who's popular, and who's just one step away from power?

Recent work from my laboratory has shown that our mind's representations of the social world—what are known as “cognitive maps”—shape many of our critical social skills. These maps are used to rise in influence, figure out when we choose to talk about others and build tighter bonds between those in our inner circle. Social success depends not just on who you know but also on how well you understand the invisible architecture of your social world.

Mapping this social architecture is no small feat. Consider the magnitude of the challenge. Real-world social networks are large, with hundreds of people and tens of thousands of possible connections. Knowing who is connected to whom is no trivial task. Every time a relationship is forged or destroyed, you need to mentally update that map. My colleagues and I wanted to understand what type of cognitive map would enable you to constantly keep stock of the changing social landscape. And perhaps more importantly, we wanted to know why someone would take the time and effort to mentally track the web of connections that surrounds them. It turns out that building a cognitive map of your social network affords quite a lot; in fact, it gives you superpowers.

To better understand the powers of social navigation, my collaborator Apoorva Bhandari, cognitive neuroscientist at Brown University, and I developed a series of studies to probe how people build cognitive maps. But first we needed a population to follow. We wanted to test these mapmaking skills in a large group of people who have never met and yet one day find themselves living in close proximity. What better option than college freshmen? Across a year we logged friendships as they formed and faded, building a live network of roughly 200 people. We also asked each student to tell us about their personality: “Do you like to socialize, or are you more of a wallflower?” Finally, we asked each student to tell us how they thought others were connected, yielding a second map of their beliefs about the network.

In one study, for example, we find that those who rise to the top of the social hierarchy aren't the most charismatic or extroverted—they're the best social mapmakers. By repeatedly asking our participants who their friends are, we can quantify who is most well-connected to other well-connected people—that is, who is most influential in their social network. The most influential people, this work shows, are the ones that quickly build mental maps of how their peers are connected. Armed with such a map, it's relatively easy to identify who is part of which clique or group or whether there might be holes in the network where you can strategically position yourself. In contrast, people who were initially quite influential—connected to many other well-connected people—but who did not have accurate mental maps of the network did not stay influential for long.

In a second paper, we examined whether mapmaking aids in another type of socially adaptive behavior: gossiping. While spilling the tea often gets a bad rap, the humdrums of life get spiced up through the stories we hear or tell others, and it can be an efficient way to quickly learn about the ins and outs of the community. Gossip has even shaped history from the shadows (for example, it's been a tool used in civil rights movements and royal coups), which means paying attention to the currents of gossip is likely a worthwhile endeavor. People seem to be quite sensitive to tracing gossip. We rarely get caught talking about others, for instance, even though more than 65 percent of our conversations are about other people.

To understand how humans pull off this remarkable feat, we wondered whether mapmaking helps predict where information will spread. Calculating which of many paths gossip might travel requires quite a bit of mental math. You can't just know the ties among your friends; you also need to grasp the connections between your friends' friends and beyond. Mental maps become quite useful in this case, we found, especially because they capture two key features of the network: how popular someone is and how far they are from the target of gossip. Maps that gauge popularity and distance can be used to quickly compute a good confidant—someone who is just far enough from the target so that gossip won't reach them yet well-connected enough to spread information effectively.

How does the brain build these maps? Two recent studies from my lab explain the map-building machinery that enables social wayfinding. In one study, still unpublished, we find that the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex—a neural hub known for navigating physical space—also carries a map of connections between people. The stronger these maps are encoded in the brain, the better people are at brokering ties that knit their communities together.

In another study, we also found evidence that the brain refines these maps during rest, when it has the time to think about all the possible network connections. This process of revisiting recent experiences is known as replay, akin to rewinding a movie on high speed. In this case, people at rest seem to be unconsciously thinking about all the ties in the network at extraordinarily high speeds. If the rest period includes sleep, the map becomes fuzzier (rather than more precise). This might sound problematic, but this fuzziness actually helps reveal the overall shape of the network by making it more abstract. Abstraction, by design, naturally highlights the most important structures in the network—just as impressionist Claude Monet used broad, choppy brushstrokes to reveal the important elements in his paintings, letting his lily pads come into focus when viewed at a distance. For social networks, abstraction works by bringing into relief the most important routes, the highways and major arteries of the system. If the brain needs to quickly figure out where gossip might spread, knowing where the popular people are positioned, or the key relationships that bridge otherwise disconnected communities, allows us to chart the sequence of ties that can efficiently cross the network.

Surrounded by my three children, I often catch myself belting out lyrics from the movie Moana, “We set a course to find a brand-new island everywhere we roam.... We know the way.” But strategic wayfinding isn't only for physical space. It is just as necessary to be able to effectively navigate through our social landscapes. Armed with a deliberately fuzzy atlas of our social community, skilled social navigators can do what no GPS can. They see the bridges before they're built, steer around the storms of rumor, and chart a course to common ground.

Discover new clues about how our ancient relatives disappeared from time.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

“There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something,” says Thorin Oakenshield in J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved fantasy novel The Hobbit. “You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after.”

For example, in 2015, paleoanthropologist Ludovic Slimak made a remarkable discovery at Grotte Mandrin, a cave in Rhône Valley, France. He and his team had been working the area since 1998 to find remnants of humanity's prehistoric forbearers, and after 17 years, they certainly found something: a piece of a jaw belonging to a Neanderthal.

As the years went on, more and more remains of this Neanderthal were discovered. “I began to find {remnants of the Neanderthal's jaw} in 2015,” Slimak told the New Statesman in 2022, “but each year we find one tooth, or one fragment of bone.” Slimak determined that this particular Neanderthal lived 42,000 years ago, towards the end of that species' time on this planet.

As such, he named the Neanderthal Thorin after the Tolkien character. “Thorin in the Hobbit is one of the last dwarf kings under the mountain and the last of its lineage,” Slimak told the website IFLScience. “Thorin the Neanderthal is also an end of lineage. An end of a way to be human.”

To confirm his suspicions about Thorin's age and attempt to glean more information about not just when but how this particular specimen lived, Slimak and his colleagues had Thorin's genome analyzed. The results, published in the journal Cell Genomics, show that Thorin's lineage managed to stay isolated from the rest of the Neanderthal population, “in spite of the fact that other groups lived nearby.”

Nearly a decade before ever finding Thorin, Slimak had already theorized that any Neanderthals who had resided in the Rhône Valley would have been different from those in the surrounding areas. His assessment, at that point, was based on the stone tools found at various sites, noting that those in the Rhône Valley didn't reflect the newer tool-making style found at other locations.

“It turns out that what I proposed 20 years ago was predictive,” Slimak told the publication Live Science. “The population of Thorin had spent 50 millennia without exchanging a single gene with the classical Neanderthal populations.” The analysis showed that Thorin had “high genetic homozygosity,” which indicates inbreeding in the lineage's recent past. It also offers no evidence of interbreeding with modern humans of the time.

“Everything must be rewritten about the greatest extinction in humanity and our understanding of this incredible process that will lead Homo sapiens to remain the only survival of humanity,” Slimak said in assessing what this discovery means. “How can we imagine populations that lived for 50 millennia in isolation while they are only two weeks' walk from each other? All processes need to be rethought.”

You can't see them, but these spacetime tunnels could be changing the fabric of everything you know.

Scientists in Greece have laid out a mathematical framework to help explain a so-far-unsolved gap in our understanding of how gravity scales up to the full size of our universe. 

Specifically, cosmologists can't yet account for how expansion of the universe increased in the “recent cosmological past”—a very relative term—because all attempts to quantify the change so far end up clashing with existing mathematical models. The Greek scientists suggest something particularly squiggly: microscopic wormholes, whose nature and density could fill up the missing pieces. These spacetime Orbeez require only a bit of fine-tuning from theories that are already in the zeitgeist.

In the paper, which appears in the peer-reviewed journal Physical Review D from the American Physical Society, the authors explain that the “positive cosmological constant” meant to quantify our expanding universe has, instead, created math issues: “[Q]uantum field theoretical analysis predicts a value up to 120 orders of magnitude larger than the observed one.”

An order of magnitude is not simply a 1:1 multiplier, so 120 orders of magnitude is likely far more than 120 times larger. But if your lifetime likelihood of being struck by lightning is about 1 in 15,300, 120 times larger jumps to 1 in 127. (Thank you to several keen-eyed readers who wrote to explain that 120 orders of magnitude is many, many times larger than 120 times! With the real value, you are almost definitely getting struck by lightning.) 

If we want to balance the two possibilities, the scientists explain, we need to add at least one new complicating factor. The two main suggestions for this are, first, a changing cosmological constant explained by the idea of dark energy; or second, to deepen our theory of how gravity behaves on the cosmic scale, from a smooth background to a craggier, fjord-like complexity. 

This paper suggests combining both options: What if the solution is a believably craggier background gravity covered with instantons and wormholes, and their more rugged landscape naturally accounts for an amount of dark energy as well?

Let's define some terms. When cosmologists try to model the universe, they break it down using practices like topology and manifold theory. They build in as many variables or ideas as they have at the time, leaving spaces where something is not yet known. And, just like in your high school calculus class, the goal is always to account for everything on both sides of any equal sign or other equivalence in your mathematical model. 

The physics of different scales simply don't match easily yet. Concrete observations by Albert Einstein and those before turned into beautiful theories that account for the visible world and parts of outer space; quantum mechanics twists those pieces until they no longer fit together into a completed puzzle. Considering spacetime as a manifold, or a surface that is guided by interlocking math on a grand scale, lets physicists look for the correct new place for a particular piece of the puzzle.

One way spacetime acts up is called quantum foam. On an extraordinarily tiny level, scientists believe, even quantum phenomena break down and create tiny bubbles where principles no longer apply. If someone can be a writer's writer or a comedian's comedian, this is kind of the disruptive quantum mechanics of quantum mechanics. And it's in this foam where wormholes could exist in a way that brings cosmic ideas together without breaking any larger rules. 

The term “wormhole” may even be misleading, because they can be tunnels, but may also simply be punched holes that cross through higher dimensions behind the scenes. Manifold theory allows scientists to add these dimensions and at least attempt to rationalize them, something difficult to do using a three-dimensional human mind.

Once we allow that there could be wormholes in the foam, the scientists explain in the paper, a number of other relevant math operations and transformations build on that foundation. The solution, “an effective cosmological constant,” appears when you apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem: “[T]he variation of the Gauss-Bonnet term on a manifold that has topology changes due to the formation of wormholes is not zero.” 

In astrophysics, that's a mic drop.

As for where dark energy comes into this, it's still a part of our working model of the universe, wormholes or not. In this case, the wormholes would directly account for at least some of that dark energy: “[T]he wormhole density in a dynamical spacetime is not expected to be constant, therefore the obtained effective cosmological constant also acquires a dynamical nature, i.e., it corresponds to an effective dark energy sector.”

In other words, the churn of the micro wormholes creates a changing constant. And to account for the observed cosmological constant, all we need is “1016 microscopic wormholes,” or 10 quadrillion, “per cubic meter per second.” That, the scientists conclude, is well within the realm of possibility based on estimates.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Gothenburg, the second-largest city in Sweden, has been hiding its past underneath its present for 400 years. Just under Gothenburg's industrial district of Gamlestaden, Archaeologists discovered remnants of the lost Late Middle Ages city of Nya Lödöse, a site that started forming in the late 1400s and was abandoned in 1624. 

Excavations, according to Arkeologerna, the State Historical Museums, revealed the southernmost part of Nya Lödöse, complete with an earthen rampart, a moat, a street with the foundation of homes dotted along its sides, and a fortified southern gate. 

While evidence shows the area served as an agricultural site as early as the late 1400s, archaeologists believe the rampart and moat were likely built around 1530. Historical museum officials believe the early days of Nya Lödöse didn't last long, with the settlement abandoned in 1547 and residents moving to the newly established Alvsborg. But the vacancy wasn't long. 

Within a couple of decades, inhabitants again descended on Nya Lödöse, building up the fortifications of the city. The rebuilt southern entrance, with a stone-paved gate, offered a key entry point into Nya Lödöse as the city's main street ran north-south toward the Säveån River. Timber foundations still delineate the gate's site, and a nearby building found during excavations may have been a tollhouse for the gate. 

Homes were constructed along the main road within the rampart, even if the southern part of the city offered more sparsely populated areas than the city's northern section. Organized agricultural plots spread out from the main road within the ramparts. 

Throughout the excavation, the team located ceramics, bones, coins, glass, wooden objects, and tools, helping illustrate the daily life of those in Nya Lödöse. A 2017 study in the International Journal of Historical Archaeology noted that “poverty and misery characterized the location.” 

Nya Lödöse' short history ended by 1624, following the 1621 founding of Gothenburg nearby, a slightly more strategic location for trading and defense. Even though Sweden was in control of Gothenburg, according to the Museum of Gothenburg, the city was still a border town as the Danish king had control of counties nearby, so Gothenburg featured high earthen banks and a moat, attracting residents and becoming a new center for the Swedish west coast, presaging its modern status as one of Sweden's largest urban areas. 

Within three years, Nya Lödöse was fully abandoned and eventually faded into farmland, as the rampart and moat were gradually filled back in. And as Gothenburg grew, the city's industrial area was built over the lost city in the 1870s, with large factories standing where Nya Lödöse once did, as the early Swedish city was forgotten—until now.

We spent hours comparing discounts at both retailers, and there's one clear winner.

Home improvement weekend warriors rejoice! If you've been waiting all year to pull the trigger on purchasing a new cordless drill or drill/driver, Black Friday deals are here. But you might be wondering: where to start your shopping? 

Both Lowe's and Home Depot have similar selections when it comes to these power tools (not to mention their large appliances like refrigerators and washing machines, which are also impressively discounted.) But which store will save you the most money on a drill this Black Friday? We searched extensively, and this is what we found. 

Shop Black Friday Deals at Lowe's

Shop Black Friday Deals at Home Depot 

The biggest reason I give the edge to Lowe's over Home Depot is based on how its drill deals are structured. At Home Depot, the most value you'll get from its sales on power tools (and especially drills) hinges on buying additional items with a purchase. For instance, buying a Ryobi battery starter kit would include a free tool of your choice. This is no doubt tantalizing for some, but I'm more inclined to get truly excited about a sale if I'm saving actual dollars on the thing I want most.

Most people looking for a new drill need just that: a new drill. Sometimes, you might like an extra battery pack, but if your cordless tool collection is extensive, you probably have more than enough batteries.  

If deals in the form of dollars saved is where your head is this Black Friday, this deal from Lowe's on the DeWalt cordless drill does just that. No bundles or add-ons. Just a high-quality drill that costs $60 less than the standard retail price.

We also like this option from Craftsman because it strips away all the extra fluff. Instead of paying more money for more items at a great overall discount percentage, we like the idea of getting a quality item at the most affordable price, regardless of any other factors. While $30 off might not make your eyes pop, the key point is you're only spending 70 bucks.

In contrast, the best driver deal we found at Home Depot maximizes total savings but ends up giving you more than you might need at a bigger discount. The Milwaukee driver combo kit is on sale for a notable 41 percent off, which is certainly nothing to scoff at. However, the kit has both a drill driver and impact driver in it, as well as a couple of batteries. While nice if you are starting from scratch, even the heavily slashed price is still going to run you for more than just buying the exact item you need at sale price from Lowe's.

Listen, there isn't really a wrong answer when shopping this holiday season. Black Friday sales shave off enough that you won't exactly get hosed no matter which site you end up shopping at. Our main point is that we prefer hard dollars off and individual items over bundles and combos purchases. It may not lead to the flashiest headlines, but it almost certainly means you'll spend less overall at checkout.

The goo, which is heavily alkaline serpentinite mud, contained lipid biomarkers, supporting the theory that early life began near ancient mud volcanoes

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Trek through the Mojave during triple digit temperatures or camp out in the Antarctic in the depths of winter, and you'll get the idea that the Earth can be quite an inhospitable place. But even these situations don't come close to qualifying as the most intense living conditions on Earth—the ones that incredible organisms known as extremophiles call home. 

The Aquifex genus of bacteria, for instance, thrive in the hot springs of Yellowstone, where temperatures can reach a balmy 205 degrees Fahrenheit. And the tiny multicellular parasite Henneguya salminicola eschews oxygen altogether. The unofficial mascot of these extreme creatures—the tardigrade—can even survive for a long spell in the cold vacuum of space. 

A new study, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, is adding more stunning evidence to the already impressive resume of extremophiles. Analyzing 5.4-foot-long core samples taken from one of the most intense environments on the planet—mud volcanoes near the Mariana Trench—scientists have found lipid biomarker evidence pointing to microbial life living within this serpentinite mud (which is created from a reaction that occurs when water interacts with igneous rock). Because this rock is often located deep within the Earth and requires water to form, it's often found near subduction zones.

At lower depths, this serpentinized rock, when oxidized, is a light green color. But as you drill deeper, the rocks turns into a kind of blue-hued goo, which is made of serpentinite with bits of brucite. This blue mud is very hazardous to life, as it maintains an extremely alkaline pH of 12—similar to that of bleach—and is severely lacking in any nutrients. In fact, this goo is so inhospitable that finding biomarkers in the first place proved quite a challenge, as DNA can be too difficult to detect with such a low number of cells. 

“But we were able to detect fats,” Palash Kumawat, the lead author of the study and a Ph.D. student at the University of Bremen, said in a press statement. “With the help of these biomarkers we were able to obtain insights into the survival strategies of methane- and sulfate-metabolizing microbes in this extreme environment.”

These fats come from the cell membranes of bacteria and archaea, and their age can tell scientists if these microbial communities are currently flourishing in this environment or are fossilized evidence of past habitation. The study found that these particular organisms are indeed persisting below the seafloor, and are part of a larger community of sub-seafloor dwellers that, by some estimates, makes up an astonishing 15 percent of Earth's living biomass.  “This distinction helps us when working in areas with extremely low biomass and nutrient deficiency,” Kumawat said in a press statement. 

Strangely, it's been a big year for “mysterious goo,” as a study from just this summer extracted evidence of new forms of life from a sample of black goo found in the rudder shaft of a research vessel. But this new-blue-goo find is particularly appealing, as scientists have long identified ancient mud volcanoes as perfect habitats for the creation of early life on Earth. 

“What is fascinating about these findings is that life under these extreme conditions, such as high pH and low organic carbon concentrations is even possible,” Florence Schubotz, senior author of the study from University of Bremen, said in a press statement. “It is simply exciting to obtain insights into such a microbial habitat because we suspect that primordial life could have originated at precisely such sites.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Physicists reveal a new quantum state where electrons run wild","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251116105625.htm","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 05:47:32 GMT","

Electricity keeps modern life running, from cars and phones to computers and nearly every device we rely on. It works through the movement of electrons traveling through a circuit. Although these particles are far too small to see, the electric current they produce flows through wires in a way that resembles water moving through a pipe.

In some materials, however, this steady flow can suddenly lock into organized, crystal-like patterns. When electrons settle into these rigid arrangements, the material undergoes a shift in its state of matter and stops conducting electricity. Instead of acting like a metal, it behaves as an insulator. This unusual behavior provides scientists with valuable insight into how electrons interact and has opened the door to advances in quantum computing, high-performance superconductors used in energy and medical imaging, innovative lighting systems, and extremely precise atomic clocks.

A group of physicists at Florida State University, including National High Magnetic Field Laboratory Dirac Postdoctoral Fellow Aman Kumar, Associate Professor Hitesh Changlani, and Assistant Professor Cyprian Lewandowski, has now identified the specific conditions that allow a special kind of electron crystal to form. In this state, electrons arrange themselves in a solid lattice yet can also shift into a more fluid form. This hybrid phase is called a generalized Wigner crystal, and the team's findings appear in npj Quantum Materials, a Nature publication.

How Electron Crystals Form

Scientists have long known that electrons in thin, two-dimensional materials can solidify into Wigner crystals, a concept first proposed in 1934. Experiments in recent years have detected these structures, but researchers had not fully understood how they arise once additional quantum effects are considered.

""In our study, we determined which 'quantum knobs' to turn to trigger this phase transition and achieve a generalized Wigner crystal, which uses a 2D moiré system and allows different crystalline shapes to form, like stripes or honeycomb crystals, unlike traditional Wigner crystals that only show a triangular lattice crystal,"" Changlani said.

To explore these conditions, the team relied on advanced computational tools at FSU's Research Computing Center, an academic service unit of Information Technology Services, as well as the National Science Foundation's ACCESS program (an advanced computing and data resource under the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure). They used methods such as exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, and Monte Carlo simulations to test how electrons behave under various scenarios.

Processing Enormous Amounts of Quantum Data

Quantum mechanics assigns two pieces of information to every electron, and when hundreds or thousands of electrons interact, the total amount of data becomes extremely large. The researchers used sophisticated algorithms to compress and organize this overwhelming information into networks that could be examined and interpreted.

""We're able to mimic experimental findings via our theoretical understanding of the state of matter,"" Kumar said. ""We conduct precise theoretical calculations using state-of-the-art tensor network calculations and exact diagonalization, a powerful numerical technique used in physics to collect details about a quantum Hamiltonian, which represents the total quantum energy in a system. Through this, we can provide a picture for how the crystal states came about and why they're favored in comparison to other energetically competitive states.""

A New Hybrid: The Quantum Pinball Phase

While studying the generalized Wigner crystal, the team uncovered another surprising state of matter. In this newly identified phase, electrons show both insulating and conducting behavior at the same time. Some electrons remain anchored in place within the crystal lattice, while others break free and move throughout the material. Their motion resembles a pinball ricocheting between stationary posts.

""This pinball phase is a very exciting phase of matter that we observed while researching the generalized Wigner crystal,"" Lewandowski said. ""Some electrons want to freeze and others want to float around, which means that some are insulating and some are conducting electricity. This is the first time this unique quantum mechanical effect has been observed and reported for the electron density we studied in our work.""

Why These Discoveries Matter

These results expand scientists' ability to understand and control how matter behaves at the quantum level.

""What causes something to be insulating, conducting or magnetic? Can we transmute something into a different state?"" Lewandowski said. ""We're looking to predict where certain phases of matter exist and how one state can transition to another -- when you think of turning a liquid into gas, you picture turning up a heat knob to get water to boil into steam. Here, it turns out there are other quantum knobs we can play with to manipulate states of matter, which can lead to impressive advances in experimental research.""

By adjusting these quantum knobs, or energy scales, researchers can push electrons from solid to liquid phases within these materials. Understanding Wigner crystals and their related states may shape the future of quantum technologies, including quantum computing and spintronics -- a rapidly evolving area of condensed-matter physics that promises faster, more efficient nano-electronic devices with lower energy use and reduced manufacturing costs.

The team aims to further explore how electrons cooperate and influence one another in complex systems. Their goal is to address fundamental questions that could ultimately drive innovations in quantum, superconducting, and atomic technologies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic deliver huge weight loss but new research reveals a hidden catch","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251116105627.htm","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 03:41:31 GMT","

Three new Cochrane reviews report that GLP-1 drugs can lead to meaningful weight loss, although the strong involvement of pharmaceutical companies in many studies raises concerns. The World Health Organization (WHO) requested these reviews to help shape upcoming recommendations on using these medications for obesity treatment.

The analyses evaluated three GLP-1 receptor agonists used for weight management and found that each one produced clinically important weight loss when compared with placebo. Even so, there is still limited or uncertain evidence about their long-term safety, possible side effects, and how financial ties might influence study results.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists were first introduced in the mid-2000s to help people with type 2 diabetes. In that setting, particularly among those with underlying heart or kidney disease, the drugs helped improve blood sugar levels, lowered the risk of related complications, aided weight reduction, and reduced the likelihood of early death.

More recently, researchers have been testing GLP-1 receptor agonists in people with obesity. These medications work by imitating a natural hormone that slows digestion and helps individuals feel full for longer. In the United Kingdom, they are approved for weight management when combined with a reduced calorie diet and physical activity for people with obesity or for those who are overweight with related health issues.

GLP-1 drugs show promise for weight management

Across the reviewed studies, tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide consistently led to significant weight loss over one to two years compared with placebo, and the benefits appeared to continue during ongoing treatment.

The reviews found little to no difference between the drugs and placebo when looking at major cardiovascular events, mortality, or quality of life. However, nausea and digestive discomfort appeared more often among people taking GLP-1 drugs, and some participants discontinued treatment because of these side effects.

""These drugs have the potential to bring about substantial weight loss, particularly in the first year,"" says Juan Franco, co-lead researcher from Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany. ""It's an exciting moment after decades of unsuccessful attempts to find effective treatments for people living with obesity.""

Independent research and equitable access are key

Most of the studies included in the reviews were funded by the companies that manufacture the drugs and were shaped by those companies in terms of design, analysis, and reporting. This has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest and highlights the importance of independent research.

The authors also stressed that the use of these medications should be viewed in a broader health context, including issues such as access, affordability, and insurance coverage, so that existing health inequities are not made worse. Costs remain a major barrier, particularly for semaglutide and tirzepatide, while liraglutide has become more affordable since its patent expired. Semaglutide's patent is set to expire in 2026.

Most of the trials were conducted in middle- and high-income countries, with little or no representation from regions such as Africa, Central America, and Southeast Asia. Because body composition, eating patterns, and health behaviors differ around the world, the authors emphasized the need to understand how these drugs work in more diverse populations.

""We need more data on the long-term effects and other outcomes related to cardiovascular health, particularly in lower-risk individuals,"" says Eva Madrid, co-lead researcher from the Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile. ""Weight regain after stopping treatment may affect the long-term sustainability of the observed benefits. More independent studies from a public health perspective are needed.""

The reviews highlight the need for long-term, independent investigations to guide clinical and policy decisions and to better define the role of GLP-1 receptor agonists in lasting weight management.

Commissioned by the World Health Organization, the reviews will contribute to upcoming WHO guidelines on the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists for treating obesity.

T cell exhaustion is a major barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy. Although immune checkpoint blockade can reinvigorate exhausted T cells, not all patients achieve long-term responses, partly due to the refractory nature of terminally exhausted T cells. Beyond persistent antigen stimulation, the environmental drivers of exhaustion remain to be thoroughly characterized. Here we identify CD47 upregulation in tumor-infiltrating exhausted CD8+ T cells in both human and murine tumors. We reveal a novel role for the extracellular matrix protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) in engaging CD47 on T cells to promote exhaustion. This interaction activates calcineurin–NFAT signaling, inducing upregulation of TOX and expression of inhibitory receptors, and impairing effector function during tumor progression. Importantly, disrupting the TSP-1–CD47 axis prevents T cell exhaustion and enhances tumor control. Our findings identify a novel pathway promoting T cell dysfunction and suggest that targeting the TSP-1–CD47 axis is a promising strategy to enhance T cell immunity and immunotherapy efficacy.

A systematic investigation of aging patterns across virtually all major tissues in nonhuman primates, our evolutionarily closest relatives, can provide valuable insights into tissue aging in humans, which is still elusive largely due to the difficulty in sampling. Here, we generated and analyzed multi-omics data, including transcriptome, proteome and metabolome, from 30 tissues of 17 female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) aged 3–27 years. We found that certain molecular features, such as increased inflammation, are consistent across tissues and align with findings in mice and humans. We further revealed that tissue aging in macaques is asynchronous and can be classified into two distinct types, with one type exhibiting more pronounced aging degree, likely associated with decreased mRNA translation efficiency, and predominantly contributing to whole-body aging. This work provides a comprehensive molecular landscape of aging in nonhuman primate tissues and links translation efficiency to tissue-specific aging.

Aging-associated mRNAs and proteins overlapping across 30 tissues were identified using a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and |βp|> 0.008. Here, βp represents the age effect size derived from a pooled linear regression model (molecular abundance ~ age + tissue), while βt represents the age effect size from tissue-specific linear models (molecular abundance ~ age per tissue). For each individual tissue, statistical significance was assessed using two-sided t-tests on the age coefficients derived from the tissue-specific linear models, and these P values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Exact P values are provided in Supplementary Data 1-2. The P values of <0.05, <0.01, and <0.001 in each tissue are denoted by *, **, and ***, respectively.

A linear regression model was applied to each tissue to identify aging-associated mRNAs and proteins, selecting those with P < 0.05 and an absolute age effect size (|βt|) > 0.04. To ensure tissue specificity, candidate molecules were further required to be significant (P < 0.05) in no more than two tissues. a-b, the upregulated (a) and downregulated (b) tissue-specific aging-related mRNAs. c-d, the upregulated (c) and downregulated (d) tissue-specific aging-related proteins. Top one marker for each tissue is shown to the right of the heatmap. STG: Superior_temporal_gyrus; SG: Supramarginal_gyrus.

Overlapped downregulated aging-related mRNAs include COL3A1, PIK3R1, and PANK1. f-g, Volcano plots of aging-related proteins in mice (f) and macaques (g). Note that the significance of protein data in mice is directly derived from Gregory's study (Cell Reports, 2023). h, Venn plot of significantly changed aging-related proteins. Among these, 28 overlapped upregulated proteins between mice and macaques include IGHM, PZP, IGKC, ITIH4, JCHAIN, KNG1, F2, AGT and CP, while three downregulated proteins are NRAS, FKBP4 and HSPH1.

a, Design and algorithm for estimating mRNA translation efficiency by integration of transcriptomes and proteomes. We hypothesize that, under a steady-state, protein concentration is stable, thus protein synthesis from mRNA is equal to protein degradation from existing proteins. In other words, the protein-to-mRNA ratio equals the mRNA translation efficiency-to-protein degradation (TED) ratio. Changes in TED (cTED) with aging were calculated using a linear regression model (TED ~ age), based on its age effect size (βt). b, Distribution of cTED in different tissues. Type I, II, and undefined tissues are in tomato, blue, and gold, respectively.

Electrosynthesis of value-added chemicals in strong acids can mitigate carbon loss and the operational cost of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, molecular catalysis for CO2RR is typically conducted in neutral or alkaline environments. CO2RR in acidic media is challenged by the scarcity of catalyst candidates, competitive hydrogen evolution and slow product formation. Here we report a locally ionic yet simultaneously hydrophobic and aerophilic layered structure that modulates the microenvironment surrounding cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) molecular catalysts, enabling efficient, multielectron CO2RR in acidic media. Experiment and theoretical modelling reveal that the polarized electrostatic field arising from the cationic groups suppresses hydronium migration. Concurrently, the van der Waals forces between the reactant gas and alkyl groups improve local CO availability, combining to achieve a methanol partial current density of 132 mA cm−2 with 62% selectivity at a pH of ~1 and –1.37 VRHE for CoPc, exceeding previous reports on neutral or alkaline electrolytes. The improved CO coverage also enables the detection of *CHO and *CO intermediates from in situ spectroscopy. We validate our strategy on various molecules, which champion the efficient inhibition of hydrogen evolution and improved CO2RR partial current density in acidic media. CoPc-based layered structure with similar ionic, hydrophobic and aerophilic interfaces also yields comparable methanol productivity.

Wearable human–machine interfaces with inertial measurement units (IMUs) are widely applied across healthcare, robotics and interactive technologies. However, extracting reliable signals remains challenging owing to motion artefacts in real-world environments. Here we present a human–machine interface capable of tolerating diverse motion artefacts through deep learning-enhanced wearable sensors. The system integrates a six-channel IMU, an electromyography module, a Bluetooth microcontroller unit and a stretchable battery, enabling wireless capture and transmission of gesture signals. A convolutional neural network trained on a composite dataset of gestures and motion artefacts extracts robust signals, while parameter-based transfer learning improves the generalizability of the network across users. A sliding-window approach converts the extracted gesture signals into real-time, continuous control of a robotic arm during dynamic activities such as running, high-frequency vibration, posture changes, oceanic wave motion and combinations of these. This work demonstrates the potential of wearable human–machine interfaces for complex real-world applications.

Wearable devices have shown great promise in various applications, such as continuous health monitoring1,2,3, energy harvesting4,5,6 and storage7,8,9, and human–machine interfaces10,11,12. Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) that can capture gesture signals have proven to be particularly valuable for virtual and augmented reality13, non-verbal communication14, physiological monitoring15, sports rehabilitation16 and robotic control17. However, gesture signals are inevitably confounded by motion artefacts in real-world applications (Supplementary Note 1). Such motion artefacts can arise from environmental activities such as walking, running or sitting in moving vehicles, from the changing orientations of the IMUs owing to the gravity vector (Supplementary Fig. 1) or from combinations of these. The motion artefacts may exhibit similar frequencies to those of gesture signals, or different frequencies but larger magnitudes that overwhelm them, or may vary among individuals. Hence, recovering gesture signals amid these motion artefacts is a major challenge18,19,20.

Existing methods for mitigating motion artefacts in IMUs can be broadly categorized into hardware- and software-based approaches (Supplementary Note 2). For hardware-based approaches, reducing the device thickness or enhancing the adhesion between the device and the skin can help minimize motion artefacts caused by relative displacement at the skin–sensor interface21. Although this method is effective in biopotential measurement, it is less effective for IMUs, which inherently capture unintentional disturbances during body movements. In addition, incorporating additional sets of IMUs can eliminate common motion artefacts. Specifically, a dual-IMU configuration placed at adjacent anatomical sites (for example, the suprasternal notch and sternal manubrium) can record identical motion artefacts induced by body movements while recording physiological signals of different magnitudes (for example, respiration and heart rates)22. However, this approach is applicable to only specific locations and is not suitable for most other regions. A multi-IMU configuration (for example, on the torso and limbs) has also been explored to derive differential signals eliminating common motion artefacts23, but this approach suffers from sensor misalignment, asynchronization and inconsistent patterns of motion artefacts across different body segments.

For software-based approaches, methods including bandpass filtering24, wavelet transform25 and principal component analysis26 can isolate signals without requiring prior knowledge of motion artefact characteristics. However, the effectiveness of these techniques relies on the assumption that the signal (for example, biopotential, respiration rate or heart rate) exhibits distinct spectral and spatial characteristics from motion artefacts. This assumption does not apply to gesture signals in IMUs, which share similar characteristics to motion artefacts. Moreover, these methods are not well suited for real-time gesture recognition involving multiple gesture types owing to their high computational cost. In addition, motion artefacts can be eliminated by leveraging prior knowledge of their characteristics. Adaptive signal decomposition separates signals into constituent components characterized by specific frequency bands or distinct features, enabling selective removal of motion artefacts18, whereas adaptive filtering uses a correlated reference to iteratively subtract motion artefacts27. However, both methods are computationally intensive28, require case-specific parameter tuning29 and suffer from edge effects30. In addition, machine learning models have been trained to filter motion artefacts, but these models have only been tested on simulated Gaussian noise31, which does not incorporate characteristics of real-world motion artefacts, such as complex sources, varying intensities and temporal misalignment between signals and motion artefacts.

Here we demonstrate unprecedented deep learning-enhanced wearable sensors that accurately recognize gestures despite the presence of diverse real-world motion artefacts (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Note 3). The sensors comprise a six-channel IMU, an electromyography (EMG) module, a Bluetooth microcontroller unit and a customized battery, all mounted on a fabric substrate. The sensors feature a compact multilayered architecture (1.8 × 4.5 cm2, with a thickness of 2 mm) with >20% stretchability. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a composite dataset containing gesture signals and motion artefacts from various sources. Then the collected IMU data were processed by the trained CNN, enabling accurate gesture recognition even when the individual was running, changing postures, experiencing high-frequency vibrations, floating in oceanic waves, or encountering combinations of these conditions. Moreover, we applied transfer learning to streamline the training process for new individuals. In addition, a sliding-window mechanism realizes continuous gesture recognition. The recognized gestures, combined with digitally filtered EMG signals, were used to precisely control a robotic arm in real time.

The dashed frame specifies the device area. After continuous operation for 30 min under ambient conditions, the peak temperature of the sensors stabilized at 27.7 °C.

Source data

The sensors were designed with four layers32 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2). The first layer was a battery bonded onto a fabric substrate. Inside the battery, 2 cells were connected in series to provide an output voltage of ~3.1 V (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Methods). After 60 charge–discharge cycles, the battery capacity maintained at ~25 mAh, even under bending and stretching33 (Supplementary Note 4). The coulombic efficiency remained at ~100% (Fig. 1c and Methods).

The second, third and fourth layers formed the circuit (Methods). The second layer incorporated an antenna-matching unit and an amplifier module for EMG collection. We used tri-layered EMG electrodes34 (Supplementary Note 5): the bottom was an elastomer substrate providing structural support; the middle was an island-bridge structured stretchable Cu35, which ensured robust bonding with the circuit and reduced the electrode impedance (Supplementary Fig. 3); the top was an elastomer doped with carbon nanotubes (CNTs)36, which protected the Cu from abrasion and corrosion (Methods).

The third layer integrated a six-channel IMU to acquire gesture signals and a Bluetooth microcontroller unit for signal processing and wireless transmission to a backend receiver. We measured the Bluetooth signal intensity using the received signal strength indicator in an open environment at varying distances (Methods). The signals remained strong and stable (decreased from −46 dBm to −96 dBm) up to 20 m (Fig. 1d). The highest temperature within the sensors after 30 min of continuous operation was observed at the Bluetooth microcontroller unit, reaching only 27.7 °C (Fig. 1e). During prolonged wear (~1 h), the skin temperature under actual wearing conditions remained stable at 34.5 °C, confirming the safety of the sensors for wearable use (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Methods).

The fourth layer housed two crystal oscillators that generated clock signals to synchronize all sensors (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Note 6). To establish connections between the different layers, we used vertical interconnect accesses to ensure mechanical robustness while minimizing constraints on stretchability32 (Methods). The circuit was cyclically stretchable to ~20% uniaxially (Extended Data Fig. 2) and ~20% biaxially, maintaining stable signal transmission without noticeable plastic deformation (Extended Data Fig. 3). The total power consumption of all sensors was 15 mW, and the customized battery could power them for >4 h (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Methods).

The sensors could acquire six channels of IMU and one of EMG. The IMU, operating at a sampling rate of 100 Hz per channel, incorporated a 3-channel accelerometer along the x, y and z axes and a 3-channel gyroscope along the roll, yaw and pitch axes. We recorded the IMU signals from 19 forearm gestures when the individual was sitting, with each gesture lasting ~1 s (Fig. 2a). In addition, we collected three representative types of motion artefact, including baseline and morphological variations in IMU signals during transitions from sitting to lying (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 8), high-frequency vibrations induced by a massage gun (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 9) and running with natural forearm swinging (Fig. 2d). Concurrently, the EMG captured muscle signals with a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz from two hand gestures: grasping and releasing (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Note 7). The signal-to-noise ratio of the EMG decreased from 67 dB (sitting) to 55 dB (running) and 29 dB (vibration), but retained sufficient fidelity to enable differentiation of muscle activities (Supplementary Fig. 11). Both IMU and EMG signals showed high temporal consistency and low noise level across various environmental conditions37 (Supplementary Figs. 12–14).

a, Depiction of 19 gesture signals when the individual is sitting. The sensors mounted on the forearm capture each gesture within 1 s. The first gesture is to keep the forearm relatively level, while the other 18 gestures vary in angle, speed and direction, and thus distinct IMU signals. The grey arrow shows the upwards and downwards forearm rotation, the blue arrow shows the leftwards and rightwards forearm rotation, and the red arrow shows the wrist rotation. b, Motion artefacts of the same 19 gestures collected when the individual is lying down. The markedly different IMU waveforms arise from the orientation shifts of the IMU relative to gravity. c, Motion artefacts when the forearm is stimulated with a high-frequency massage gun. d, Motion artefacts generated by the natural swinging of the forearm and overall body movement during running. e, Filtered EMG signals during hand grasping and releasing. The red curve represents the root mean square of the filtered signals.

Source data

We generated a composite dataset to extract gesture signals from motion artefacts (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Note 8). The dataset included forearm gesture signals (20 signals per gesture during sitting and 20 for lying down) (Supplementary Note 9) and superimposed signals obtained by adding strong motion artefacts (under the highest available running speed and maximum vibration intensity and frequency) to gesture signals (Extended Data Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 15 and Methods). Motion artefacts at different stages (that is, starting and ending points) produced varying waveforms. Therefore, motion artefacts from different stages were added to gesture signals to account for diverse conditions.

The composite dataset was assembled by superimposing diverse motion artefacts onto gesture signals. b, Comparative analysis of recall values across different deep learning models.

It includes three convolutional layers, three max-pooling layers and three fully connected (FC) layers, with cross-entropy as the loss function. d, Schematics of the transfer learning process, which features two major steps. First, the model is pre-trained on a dataset from five individuals. Second, the pre-trained model adapts to a new individual by fine-tuning, which involves training the convolutional layers at a lower learning rate with a smaller dataset from the new individual. e, Confusion matrices of the results before and after transfer learning. The minimum recognition accuracy of the 19 gestures improved from 51% to 92%. f, Schematics of the sliding-window mechanism. The window size is 1 s, with a sliding step of 0.25 s. Each segmented signal serves as an individual input, generating a separate prediction.

Source data

We trained and compared three deep-learning networks using the composite dataset and evaluated their performance based on the confusion matrix of the test outcomes. These models included a fully connected neural network as a reference, a recurrent neural network based on long short-term memory (Supplementary Figs. 16 and 17) and a CNN based on LeNet-5 (Supplementary Note 10). The CNN achieved the highest recall (>0.92), precision (>0.93), F1 score (>0.94) and specificity (>0.99), demonstrating superior performance in gesture recognition (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 18 and Supplementary Note 11). We customized the CNN to match the signal dimensions and optimize the performance in this study (Fig. 3c). At the input, six-channel IMU signals were reshaped into a single channel and passed through a one-dimensional convolutional layer with 16 kernels, resulting in 16 channels of signal representations. These were then summarized by a max-pooling layer. The process was repeated with subsequent convolutional layers using 32 and 64 kernels, each followed by max-pooling for hierachical feature summarization. Finally, the output was flattened and routed through three fully connected layers to derive the final predictions. We selected the commonly used cross-entropy as the loss function to evaluate the randomness dissimilarity between the model predictions and ground truth38 (Supplementary Note 12). During these training and validation phases, the accuracy of the CNN converged to ~1 and its loss to ~0, confirming the absence of overfitting and the appropriateness of the selected kernels and loss function (Supplementary Fig. 19). To further evaluate the model's robustness to unseen, real-world disturbances, we tested the system under two other running speeds and two other vibration intensities and frequencies without additional training. The recognition accuracy remained consistently high across all conditions (>94%), confirming the robustness of the model to unseen, real-world disturbances (Supplementary Fig. 20).

Individual variations in gesture signals (Supplementary Fig. 21) and motion artefacts (Supplementary Fig. 22), induce discrepancies between the training and testing datasets, thereby reducing the model accuracy for new individuals. We therefore applied parameter-based transfer learning to enhance the model's generalizability39. We first trained the model on the composite dataset using a learning rate of 0.01, which controlled the convolutional layers and fully connected layers. Then, we transferred the model and fine-tuned it with varying numbers of shots (that is, the number of signals from each gesture) from the new individual (Supplementary Note 13). During fine-tuning process, we used a lower learning rate of 0.001 for the convolutional layers to retain the pre-trained signal representations (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Note 14).

We evaluated the efficiency of the transfer learning process by testing 100 new signals (that is, unused in the training dataset) per gesture (Extended Data Fig. 5 and Methods). The results showed that transfer learning with only 2 shots per gesture (one recorded while sitting and one while lying down, as opposed to the 40 shots required during the initial training phase) was sufficient for a new individual. The transfer learning improved the minimum recognition accuracy across all 19 types of gesture from >51% to >92% (Fig. 3e). The time taken to collect motion artefacts from the new individual was also reduced from ~2 min to ~6 s (Supplementary Fig. 23).

To achieve continuous gesture recognition, the acquired signals should be constantly fed into the CNN for prediction. Hence, we applied a sliding-window mechanism40, where the window contained signals from either a single gesture or two consecutive gestures. We selected a window length of 1 s to match the duration of each gesture and a sliding step size of 0.25 s to balance the computational load and the overlap between consecutive windows (Fig. 3f). A larger step size could cause feature loss, whereas a smaller one could slow down the prediction rate (Supplementary Note 15).

When the sliding-window transitions between gestures, scenarios may arise where the window contains signals from two consecutive gestures. Therefore, we generated training signals using various consecutive gesture combinations. Rather than repeatedly performing such transitions manually, we simplified the process by concatenating individual superimposed gesture signals (that is, connecting two signals end-to-end) to simulate consecutive gestures. The sliding window was then applied to these concatenated signals, and each window was labelled to the gesture occupying more than 50% of its duration (Extended Data Fig. 6). A similar concatenation process was performed for signals recorded while lying down (Supplementary Fig. 24). This approach yielded 46,930 segmented signals for 19 gestures (Methods).

Although many studies have achieved high accuracy in gesture recognition using IMU and EMG with various degrees of freedom41,42,43, these approaches require the user to remain stationary, because signals are inevitably impacted by motion artefacts. We achieved comparable recognition performance even in the presence of substantial motion artefacts (Supplementary Fig. 25 and Supplementary Note 16). The latency between the gesture and the robotic arm's action was ~1.3 s, owing to the time required to capture sufficient data points for initial gesture recognition and the intrinsic response delay of the robotic arm (Fig. 4a). However, because the gesture recognition was performed continuously using the sliding-window mechanism, the robotic arm executed sequential actions without interruption. Errors might arise when the sliding window contained two consecutive gesture signals with similar proportions. To solve this problem, the robotic arm was programmed to execute an action only after receiving three sequential identical predictions (Supplementary Fig. 26). Moreover, we implemented a drop-out mechanism by abandoning the fourth identical prediction (if present) to prevent redundant robotic actions when there were two consecutive identical gestures. Simultaneously, grasping and releasing of the robotic gripper were controlled by calculating the root mean square of the EMG signals and comparing it with a predefined threshold (Supplementary Fig. 27 and Methods).

a, Schematics of controlling the robotic arm. The individual continuously performs gestures. The gesture signals are wirelessly transmitted to a backend station with a delay of ~1 ms by Bluetooth69. A sliding-window segments the gesture signals continuously after acquiring the first gesture signal, and does not segment the signal when there are not enough data points (<1 s). An online CNN model takes ~1 ms to generate a prediction for each segmented signal. Upon receiving 3 sequential predictions (~3 ms), the robotic arm responds (~275 ms) and executes the corresponding action. b, Demonstration of the individual controlling the robotic arm to transfer liquid while running on a treadmill. The IMU signals from the individual's forearm, though intertwined with motion artefacts, are processed to control the robotic arm precisely. When the root mean square of the EMG signals surpasses a predefined threshold, the robotic arm grasps the vial.

Source data

When the individual was running, the motion artefacts substantially distorted the accelerometer and gyroscope signals. The robotic arm experienced substantial unwanted vibrations without a deep learning algorithm (Supplementary Video 1). However, when equipped with the CNN trained on the composite dataset, the robotic arm executed the intended actions precisely. We successfully controlled the robotic arm to transfer liquid from a vial to a beaker (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Video 2). Similarly, precise control was maintained when the forearm was subjected to high-frequency vibrations (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Video 3), orientation changes (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Video 4) or combinations of these motion artefacts (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10 and Supplementary Videos 5 and 6). Moreover, we conducted additional characterizations using real gesture signals collected under motion artefacts (versus those obtained by superimposing motion artefacts with gesture signals for training), which showed >93% accuracy in robotic arm control (Supplementary Fig. 28).

Human–machine interfaces have been used by divers to control underwater robots for target tracking44, marine data collection45, shipwreck inspection46 and rescue operations47. However, in aquatic environments, IMUs record signals not only from the diver's gestures but also from the intricate dynamics of sea waves48, which vary substantially with wave parameters (for example, wavelength and height). Such wave-induced interferences can distort the diver's gesture signals, challenging the reliable operation of IMUs.

We trained the CNN with a composite dataset that included diverse sea-wave motions. The training dataset was originally collected in San Diego Mission Bay (Fig. 5a). However, owing to the bay's enclosed nature (as opposed to an open oceanic environment), the amplitude of the sea waves remained low, and the influence on gesture signals was negligible (Supplementary Fig. 29). Furthermore, data acquisition on certain days limited sets of sea-wave parameters. We therefore used the Scripps Ocean–Atmosphere Research Simulator, an instrument for studying oceanic states, to acquire motion artefacts generated by various sea waves (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 30 and Supplementary Video 7). Because different wave parameters influence wave behaviour49 (Supplementary Fig. 31, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Note 17), we systematically varied wavelength and wave height to represent a broad range of sea-wave conditions (Supplementary Figs. 32 and 33 and Methods), and eventually assembled an extensive dataset for each gesture.

a, Photograph of an individual wearing the sensors for the collection of motion artefacts from San Diego Mission Bay. b, Collection of sea-wave motion artefacts at the Scripps Ocean–Atmosphere Research Simulator. By adjusting the simulator's settings, a range of sea-wave patterns can be created, allowing the sensors to capture diverse signal variations induced by sea waves. c, Offline demonstration incorporating sea-wave motion artefacts. The collected sea-wave motion artefacts are superimposed on gesture signals as input for the CNN.

Source data

After training the model with this dataset, we conducted an offline demonstration simulating a diver directing a robotic arm while floating in the ocean. When tested on the IMU signals superimposed with simulated sea-wave interference, the CNN consistently generated accurate commands for the robotic arm actions (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 34), with recall, precision, specificity and F1 score all approaching ~1 on the test dataset (Supplementary Fig. 35). The presence of seawater offered a unique advantage by reducing the electrode–skin impedance50, thereby enhancing the EMG signal quality (Supplementary Fig. 36).

The sensors' architecture in this study features a multilayered, stretchable circuit design, allowing for a uniform and efficient spatial arrangement of components32, with a high degree of integration of electronics, EMG electrodes and battery. The sensors leverage a deep-learning model trained on a composite dataset, which demonstrates strong tolerance against a broad range of motion artefacts, enabling continuous and accurate robotic control under diverse real-world scenarios.

There remain multiple opportunities to further improve this technology. First, the system is currently designed to recognize gestures lasting 1 s, which is suboptimal for gestures whose durations deviate largely from this window (Supplementary Note 18). To address this problem, a potential solution would be to incorporate an additional machine learning model for signal segmentation to dynamically identify the onset and termination of each gesture. The window could also be shortened to reduce latency by minimizing the time required to acquire a complete input segment, thereby enabling faster response. In this case, a more complex CNN architecture (for example, deeper networks or larger kernel sizes) would be required to extract discriminative features from shorter signals. To further enhance feature extraction, it is also feasible to integrate a squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanism51, which can prioritize key features while minimizing the influence of irrelevant ones, such as motion artefacts (Supplementary Note 19).

Second, the current system is primarily designed to recognize single-axis and isolated gestures, which simplifies the recognition task and thus enhances model accuracy. To further improve performance and efficiency in recognizing more complex gestures, future work could explore the implementation of multi-parallel deep learning models (for example, with each model dedicated to recognizing gestures along a specific axis). This multi-model architecture would allow parallel processing of any type of signal, thereby enabling simultaneous multi-axis gesture recognition.

Third, the sensors have a limited underwater communication range (<30 cm with a received signal strength indicator of more than −90 dBm), constraining the operational range between the diver and machine (Supplementary Fig. 37). To enable practical real-time control of submerged robots, it is feasible to use Bluetooth of higher transmitting power, integrate a higher-gain, more directional antenna, and, most importantly, embed the receiving and processing unit within the submerged robot. This configuration would allow direct communication between the wearable sensors and the robots, which can eliminate the need for an intermediate system for signal acquisition, processing and robotic arm control, thereby decreasing the signal transmission loss and extending communication range. In addition, it is possible to integrate radio waves (integrated circuits for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, which is robust for communication at the air/water interface52), acoustic waves (advanced microelectromechanical systems with long transmission ranges53) and optical methods (tunable vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers and photodetectors with high transmission speeds54; Supplementary Note 20 and Supplementary Table 3).

Finally, the deep-learning model was not applied to process EMG signals in this study because the two-finger robotic gripper was designed solely for grasping and releasing. To enable fine-motor control and high-resolution gesture recognition, a multi-electrode EMG array would be required to capture spatially distinct signals from individual muscle groups55. Integrating such an array with a multimodal deep-learning model would greatly enhance the system's capacity to decode complex gestures. Alternatively, the EMG module could be replaced by an ultrasound-based system56, which has demonstrated superior capability in capturing high-resolution muscle dynamics and enabling the execution of intricate tasks with greater degrees of freedom.

Several glass slides were thoroughly cleaned using acetone, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionized water. Then, 2 glass slides were spin-coated with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, 950 A4, MicroChem) at 2,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by curing on a hotplate at 150 °C for 3 min to form a release layer. A layer of Ecoflex (00-30 Smooth-On, 1:1) was spin-coated over the PMMA at 2,000 rpm for 30 s and cured in an oven at 80 °C for 15 min. Subsequently, 3 glass slides were spin-coated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer, 10:1) at 2,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by curing on a hotplate at 150 °C for 20 min.

Separately, polyimide (PI, HD MicroSystems) was spin-coated onto Cu foils (Oak-Mitsui) at 2,000 rpm for 30 s, followed by soft baking on a hotplate at 150 °C for 3 min and hard baking in a nitrogen-protected oven at 300 °C for 1 h.

The PI-coated Cu film and the PDMS-coated glass slide were activated by ultraviolet ozone (254 nm, PSD series Digital UV Ozone System, Novascan) for 1 min. Subsequently, the PI-coated Cu film was laminated onto the PDMS-coated glass slide and then patterned using pulsed laser ablation (60% power, 10 cycles, Laser Mark's) according to a design created in AutoCAD. After removing residual materials on the patterned Cu film, it was lifted off using a water-soluble tape (AQUASOL), activated by ultraviolet ozone for 3 min, transferred onto the Ecoflex/PMMA-coated glass slide, and then placed in an oven at 80 °C for 10 min to enhance the bonding between the PI and the Ecoflex57. Next, the water-soluble tape was removed by rinsing with deionized water. After drying, the Cu film was cleaned by flux (IMPRESA) to remove the oxide surface and improve the wettability of solder paste (SMDLTLFP, Chip Quik). The solder paste was applied onto the patterned Cu film, followed by bonding the chips to the Cu film on a hotplate at 240 °C for 1 min.

Then another layer of Ecoflex was spin-coated at 2,000 rpm and cured on top of the first circuit layer as the substrate for fabricating the second layer. Laser ablation was applied to remove the Ecoflex at designed locations, forming vertical interconnect accesses to interconnect the first and second circuit layers32. Subsequently, the second layer was fabricated atop the Ecoflex substrate with identical processes to the first layer. The microcontroller unit was pre-programmed using a customized evaluation board.

The third layer was first fabricated on a new Ecoflex/PMMA-coated glass slide. It was then flipped over and aligned with the first and second layers through alignment markers observed under a microscope. The second and third layers were electrically connected by soldering 0 Ω resistors on a hotplate at 240 °C for 5 min.

Finally, the trilayer circuit was encapsulated by filling degassed Ecoflex between the 2 glass slides that sandwiched the circuit, followed by curing at 80 °C for 20 min. The PMMA-coated glass slides were removed by IPA.

The Cu layer was fabricated following the same procedure as for the circuit. Subsequently, CNTs (4 wt%) were ground and blended homogeneously with PDMS. IPA was added to further enhance the uniformity of the mixture58. We chose PDMS over Ecoflex because its lower curing rate, which allowed extended stirring time to ensure a more uniform dispersion of CNTs. In addition, PDMS and CNTs were partially soluble in IPA59, which could further enhance the uniformity of the mixture. The CNT-doped PDMS mixture was degassed and evenly spread over the glass slide with the Cu layer. Another PMMA-coated glass slide was then uniformly pressed atop to form a thin CNTs-doped PDMS film, then cured at 80 °C for 2 h. The underlying PI and Ecoflex layers at the circuit connection regions were removed using laser ablation with a power of 10%, enabling subsequent bonding to the circuit via solder paste. Finally, degassed Ecoflex was introduced into the interstitial spaces between the electrodes and the circuit to bond them together.

Four inks were formulated to print the stretchable battery: Ag, Zn, Ag2O and TiO2 (ref. 60). The Ag ink was used for the current collector, which was formulated by mixing Ag flakes, poly(styrene–ethylene–butylene–styrene) (SEBS) resin and toluene (4:2:1 weight ratio). The Zn ink was for the battery anode and was synthesized using Zn, ZnO, Bi2O3 and GBR6005 binder (25 wt% mixed in acetone) with a weight ratio of 9:0.5:0.5:0.267. The Ag2O ink was prepared as the battery cathode using Ag2O, Super P carbon black and GBR6005 fluoroelastomer (33 wt% mixed in acetone) with a weight ratio of 1.9:0.1:2.66. The TiO2 ink was prepared as the separator using TiO2, Triton X-114, SEBS (40 wt% mixed in toluene) and toluene with a weight ratio of 3:0.1:1.5:1.5. Each ink was mixed separately in a planetary mixer at 2,500 rpm for 10 min. To prepare the electrolyte, 0.9 g polyvinyl acetate (PVA) was dissolved in 9.1 ml deionized water at 90 °C. This solution was then mixed with 14 g NaOH solution (16.7 wt%) and desiccated to ~67% of its original weight, yielding a PVA hydrogel. The PVA hydrogel was then cut into the designed shape to form the electrolyte gel, followed by soaking in a 9 M NaOH solution containing 0.5 M LiOH for 12 h (ref. 61).

The battery was printed layer by layer in the sequence of Ag, Zn anode or double-layered Ag2O cathode (to enhance the capacity), and TiO2 separator, followed by curing at 80 °C for 5 min for each layer. Before assembly, the PVA hydrogel was placed between the anode and the cathode. Two batteries were connected in series using the Ag ink and subsequently heat-sealed with a SEBS film. Finally, the battery was adhered to the underside of the circuit and the fabric substrate using Silbione (Gel 4717 A/B, Bluestar Silicone). Electrical continuity between the battery and the circuit was established by Ag paste (8331DA/B, MG Chemicals). Charging was performed by contacting the two ports with two external needle electrodes, which allowed for minimal invasion of the device's encapsulation.

The power consumption of the sensors was characterized using a power profiler kit (Nordic). Electrochemical cycling was conducted using an Arbin electrochemical cycler channel at 0.2 C over 60 cycles under freestanding, bending and stretching conditions (Fig. 1c). Cut-off voltages were 2.6 V (discharge) and 3.8 V (charge). Moreover, we assessed the long-term stability of the hydrogel within the battery by placing it on a hotplate maintained at 37 °C and monitoring its weight loss over time (Extended Data Fig. 1).

To assess the battery's practical performance, we connected it to both the circuit and a battery test system (Landt Instruments CT2001A) to monitor voltage variations over time. To simulate skin temperature, the battery was concurrently placed on a hotplate maintained at 37 °C (Supplementary Fig. 7).

The commercial software ABAQUS was used to predict constrained deformations and evaluate the stretchability of serpentine interconnects within each layer (Extended Data Fig. 2). Two-layer Cu/PI laminates were modelled using four-node two-dimensional shell elements62. An explicit solver was employed to ensure convergence in simulations involving intricate contact interactions associated with the serpentine interconnects.

Cu was characterized using an ideal elastic-plastic constitutive model featuring an elastic modulus of 119 GPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.34 and a yield strength of 356 MPa (~0.3% yield strain). The mechanical behaviour of the elastomer (Ecoflex), used for encapsulation and as the substrate, was modelled using a typical hyperelastic constitutive relation. This elastomer exhibited an elastic modulus of 50 kPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.49. For PI, an elastic modulus of 2.5 GPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.27 were used. A rigid and frictionless contact model described interactions between the serpentine interconnects and electronic components. In addition, fixed boundary conditions were imposed on the two vertical edges of the model. Under uniaxial loading, the displacement components were prescribed as follows: (ux = 0, uz = 0) for the left side and (ux = εappLx, uz = 0) for the right side, where εapp is the overall strain applied to the model and Lx is the length of the model along the x direction.

The Bluetooth signal was characterized using the received signal strength indicator. Measurements were conducted through the BLE Scanner software in an open environment. To ensure data accuracy and reliability, the received signal strength indicator value was recorded 15 times under each specified condition (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 37).

Thermal images were captured by a thermal camera (FLIR, C-Series) after activating the sensors. Images were recorded every 1 min to monitor temperature variations (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 4). The testing was conducted in air and sensors were deactivated after 30 min.

To assess actual wearing conditions, a thermocouple (Sigma) was placed between the active sensors and the skin to monitor temperature continuously during sensor operation (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Raw EMG signals are often susceptible to low-frequency motion artefacts63 and 60 Hz power line noise64. To mitigate these interferences, we used a digital 30–200 Hz bandpass filter and a 60 Hz notch filter.

The root mean square (RMS) value of the EMG signals was calculated by65,66:

where n represents the length of the EMG signal and EMG(i) denotes the magnitude of the ith data point. The RMS value is the average power of the EMG signal over a defined duration: a shorter duration for analysis will increase times of computation and thus the computation load, whereas longer ones capture more bursts of muscle activity but reduce temporal resolution67. In this study, we chose n = 200 to achieve a balance. When the RMS value exceeded 0.2 mV, the robotic gripper performed grasping and, conversely, remained releasing when the value was below the threshold (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Figs. 7–10).

To account for inter-individual variations in muscle tone, which can influence EMG signal amplitudes36, we implemented an individual-specific threshold calibration strategy to reliably distinguish hand grasping from releasing65. Specifically, for each new individual, EMG signals were recorded during both grasping and releasing actions (each lasting ~2 s) over 10 cycles. The RMS values of the baseline during releasing (Vbaseline) and grasping (VEMG) were measured. The threshold for the voltage (Vthreshold) was determined as:

This calibration ensures consistent recognition performance across individuals with varying EMG signal characteristics.

The conductivity (resistance) of the electrode was measured with a digital multimeter (Keysight). Impedance was measured using a bioimpedance analyser (EVAL-AD5940BIOZ) in a three-electrode configuration (that is, working, reference and counter electrodes). All characterizations were conducted under sitting, running and vibration conditions (Supplementary Fig. 11).

The performance of the EMG electrode was further evaluated by quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio during sitting, running and vibration (Supplementary Fig. 11). In each test, the individual performed hand releasing and grasping (grip force of ~60 N).

The impedance at the electrode–skin interface was measured using a PalmSens4 potentiostat with a three-electrode configuration (Supplementary Fig. 3). The reference electrode maintains a stable potential. This setup enabled precise characterization of the impedance at the working electrode–skin interface, while the counter electrode completes the circuit68. The 3 electrodes were laminated onto the forearm with a 2 cm spacing. We utilized the galvanostatic impedance spectroscopy technique, which applied an alternating current amplitude of 1 μA (iac = 0.01 × 100 μA), across a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz, to ensure safety for the body. To simulate underwater conditions, the electrode–skin interface was submerged in seawater collected from the San Diego Mission Bay.

To evaluate the sensors' sensitivity and long-term performance under intensive activities, we conducted tests over five consecutive days. The sensors were mounted on the individual's forearm, where the IMU module recorded motion signals induced by running and the EMG module recorded signals generated by hand grasping. The signal stability was analysed across days using power spectrum density analysis (Supplementary Fig. 12).

Performance under varying temperature and humidity conditions was assessed by analysing baseline noise levels. The sensors were placed on a hotplate at different temperatures while kept stationary. In addition, the sensors were tested in an enclosed room where humidity levels were adjusted using a humidifier (Supplementary Fig. 13).

To characterize the effect of perspiration on signal quality, EMG measurements were performed at 0 min, 15 min and 30 min after treadmill running. In each scenario, the individual performed hand releasing and grasping (grip force of ~60 N; Supplementary Fig. 14).

The individual first performed each gesture 20 times while sitting. Each signal was subsequently superimposed with 18 different motion artefacts, including running, vibration and their combinations at different stages, with a duration of 1 s (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4). To address the influence of orientation changes on the baseline and morphology of the gesture signals, each gesture was also performed 20 times while lying down. These signals were superimposed with six motion artefacts related to vibration (without those from running) (Supplementary Fig. 15).

All superimposed signals used in the training dataset were unique and non-repetitive (which accommodates variability in both gesture signals and motion artefacts), thereby preventing the model from overfitting owing to memorizing recurring patterns.

In addition, to reduce the orientation discrepancies between the superimposed signals and the real gesture signals collected under different motion artefacts (versus those signals obtained by superimposing motion artefacts with gesture signals for training), we adopted two measures: first, during the collection of motion artefacts (for example, running), the individual maintained a palm-down posture, matching the orientation used during real-world gesture execution. Second, we filtered out the baseline component from the acceleration signals in the motion artefacts before superposition (note that angular velocities do not have baselines generated by gravity), which reduces the influence of static orientation, thereby aligning the superimposed signals with those of real-world gesture signals recorded under motion artefacts.

For transfer learning, we collected a training dataset from 6 volunteers with consent (5 males and 1 female, aged 21 to 34) with different movement characteristics and forearm lengths (40–50 cm). The datasets from five individuals were used to train the CNN, while the sixth dataset was used for fine-tuning and testing. During the fine-tuning process, we trained the CNN with one to four shots to determine the optimal shot number. Subsequently, 100 unused signals were randomly selected to evaluate the performance of the CNN (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 5). This ensured a strict separation between training and testing datasets, thereby preventing any potential data during training.

Each superimposed signal was concatenated with 19 other superimposed signals (including both identical and other different gestures), which produced 342 concatenated signals (19 superimposed signals with 18 or 6 stages of motion artefacts for sitting or lying down postures, respectively), each spanning 2 s. Then, a sliding window segmented each concatenated signal into 5, yielding a total of 2,280 segmented signals with motion artefacts (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 24).

In total, 2,470 signals were generated per gesture, comprising 95 segmented signals from sitting and 95 from lying down without motion artefacts, along with 2,280 segmented signals with motion artefacts. Across all 19 gestures, a total of 46,930 signals were generated per individual. The dataset was split into training, validation and testing datasets at a ratio of 70%: 15%: 15%. Performance was evaluated across 15 independent runs.

To ensure consistency in sensor orientation, the individual maintained a palm-down orientation during the robotic control. This configuration was necessary because six gestures involved the palm (that is, wrist rotations). Maintaining a consistent orientation minimized potential misclassification by the model.

IMU and EMG signals from the wearable sensors were transmitted to a USB receiver and processed by MATLAB on a desktop computer. The six-channel IMU signals were continuously segmented using a 1 s sliding window (0.25 s step) and then sent to an online trained CNN in Python. Windows shorter than 1 s were discarded. The gesture was chosen after three consecutive identical predictions, after which the count reset to prevent repetition. The predicted results were subsequently sent back to MATLAB to control the robotic arm, which executed commands continuously without reverting to the original state. In the meantime, the EMG signals were acquired and filtered in MATLAB to control the grasping and releasing of the robotic gripper based on the RMS values. The communication between Python and MATLAB was through the TCP/IP protocol (Supplementary Fig. 27). In demonstrations, the beaker was at a fixed location to ensure controlled comparison of gesture signals under different motion artefacts, but the robotic arm can accurately grasp objects placed anywhere within the workspace.

The sensors were encased within a plastic enclosure and positioned within the water channel of the Scripps Ocean–Atmosphere Research Simulator (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 30). Throughout the data-acquisition phase, the sensors remained afloat on the water surface, which emulated a diver floating in the ocean. Sea waves were generated by a paddle, with the frequency adjusted to vary wavelength (Supplementary Fig. 32) and the force adjusted to control height (Supplementary Fig. 33).

The analysis confirms that the maximum strain does not exceed 0.3%, indicating that the Cu electrodes remain well within their elastic limit and do not yield or undergo plastic deformation. To mitigate computational load, mechanical simulations were performed on individual layers rather than the entire assembly. In the actual sensors, vertical interconnect accesses between layers can lead to localized strain concentrations when stretched. Consequently, the simulations assumed a higher stretchability (25%) than the cyclic mechanical test (20%).

The sensors exhibit no plastic deformation after 300 cycles of biaxial stretching tests, which demonstrates the robustness of the design. b, Bluetooth signal strength under bi-axial stretching. The RSSI consistently remained above -60 dBm across all tested strain levels, indicating stable and continuous wireless communication. Two competing effects influence signal strength during stretching. First, mechanical strain increases the resistance of the interconnections, leading to higher transmission loss (that is, reduced signal strength). Second, as the device stretches, the antenna becomes progressively more distant from nearby electronic components, reducing parasitic capacitance and thereby decreasing signal loss (that is, improved signal strength). Due to these opposing effects, the signal strength initially decreases from increased resistance and subsequently increases as parasitic loss diminishes. The graph presents the average values, with error bars indicating the standard deviation (n = 15 independent measurements).

The superimposed signals are generated by adding motion areifacts to the gesture signal (for example, a signal of gesture 2 superimposed with 18 stages of motion artefacts in b to d). The stages are fixed rather than chosen by randomly selecting starting points from continuous motion artefact recordings. Since random selection can unintentionally introduce overlapping segments, where identical portions of motion artefacts appear in multiple superimposed signals. This redundancy may lead to overfitting, because the model may learn to recognize repeated motion artefact patterns rather than extracting generalizable features. To mitigate this risk, we deliberately divided the motion artefacts into distinct, non-overlapping stages.

Confusion matrices of the prediction results based on a, one-shot, b, three-shot, and c, four-shot transfer learning for gesture recognition. In one-shot transfer learning, the minimum observed accuracy is 69% for gesture 15, which is considered suboptimal. This limitation is attributed to the fact that a single gesture signal is obtained from a individual in only one posture: either sitting or lying down. When two or more shots are used in transfer learning, gesture signals during both sitting and lying down are collected. As a result, the recognition accuracy can stabilize and converge. Therefore, two-shot transfer learning has been adopted because it balances the time for collecting gesture signals and the accuracy (Fig. 3e).

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that targets mature oligodendrocytes (MOLs) and their myelin. MOLs are heterogeneous and can transition to immune-like states in MS. However, the dynamics of this process remain unclear. Here, we used single-cell multiome assay for transposase-accessible chromatin and RNA sequencing targeting oligodendroglia (OLG) from the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS mouse model at multiple disease stages. We found that immune OLG states appear at early disease stages and persist to late stages, which can be consistent with epigenetic memory of previous neuroinflammation. Transcription factor activity suggested immunosuppression in OLG at early disease stages. Different MOLs exhibit differential responsiveness to EAE, with MOL2 exhibiting a stronger transcriptional immune response than MOL5/MOL6, and showed divergent responses at the epigenetic level during disease evolution. Our single-cell multiomic resource highlights dynamic and subtype-specific responses of OLG to EAE, which might be amenable to modulation in MS.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS)1. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the myelinating cells of the CNS, and their precursor cells (OL precursor cells (OPCs)) are present throughout the developing and adult CNS and are capable of differentiating into myelinating mature OLs (MOLs)2. MS has been generally viewed as primarily driven by T cells and B cells3. However, recent studies revealed the expression of immunomodulatory molecules in oligodendroglia (OLG) not only in MS but also in Alzheimer's disease and aging4,5,6,7,8. These findings indicate the potential role of OLG in the modulation of immune responses within the CNS.

Single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been applied to reveal specific MOLs/OPC subpopulations in MS and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)4,9,10. Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a high-throughput sequencing technique for assessing genome-wide chromatin accessibility11 and provides information on regions with open chromatin, which is required for gene expression12. By applying single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) in combination with scRNA-seq independently, we previously found that a cohort of immune genes exhibit open chromatin in both control animals and in animals with EAE at peak disease, while their expression only increases in the context of EAE13. These studies were conducted with samples from single time points, at the peak of the disease in mouse EAE and from the late stage of disease in human postmortem MS tissue. Thus, the dynamics of OLG throughout the disease process have not been explored.

Here, we investigate the epigenomic and transcriptional dynamics of OPCs and MOLs over the course of EAE. We applied simultaneous single-cell multiome ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to OLG sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from male and female mice with EAE at three distinct time points: early, peak and late stages. At the early stage of EAE, a subset of genes involved in antigen presentation showed increased expression and chromatin accessibility in OPCs and MOLs, indicating that the induction of an immune-like state in OLG occurs before the formation of fully developed lesions. Moreover, chromatin accessibility at these genes remained highly open at the late stage of EAE, indicating either partial maintenance or an epigenetic memory of this immune-like state. Furthermore, specific MOL subtypes acquire different patterns of change in genes related to the immune response at both expression and chromatin accessibility levels over the course of disease. We observed that white matter-enriched14 MOL2 showed higher immune signatures than MOL5/MOL6, which in turn exhibited induction of chromatin accessibility in genes with regenerative pathways, particularly in the late stage. Our study provides a resource available for browsing at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Cell Browser and Genome Browser15 (https://olg-dyn-eae-multiome.cells.ucsc.edu) and a deeper understanding of OLG dynamics in the inflammatory demyelination mouse model of MS, offering insights into these cell populations as potential targets for immune modulation and myelin regeneration.

We induced EAE in Sox10:cre-RCE:loxP (enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)) transgenic mice16,17 with injection of emulsion containing the MOG35–55 immunogenic peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), followed by intraperitoneal injection of pertussis toxin. Spinal cord tissues from male and female mice induced with EAE were collected at three different stages: (1) early stage (days 8–9 after injection), (2) peak stage (days 14–15) and (3) late/chronic stage (days 37–40; Fig. 1a,b). Spinal cord samples from CFA-treated control (CFA-Ctrl) mice were also collected from the same stages, alongside spinal cord tissues from noninduced naive untreated control (Naive-Ctrl) mice. OLG were enriched based on eGFP by sorting by FACS (Extended Data Fig. 1a), after which we performed single-cell multiome RNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Fig. 1a). After sample-specific quality control filtering (Extended Data Fig. 1b and Methods), we obtained 156,205 cells. Louvain clustering was performed on the scRNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 1c,e) and scATAC-seq datasets (Extended Data Fig. 1d,f). Neighbors' graphs from both modalities were overlapped to generate a new joined projection (Fig. 1c–f and Extended Data Fig. 1g,h), annotated by cell type with marker gene expression and chromatin accessibility (Fig. 1g and Methods). As expected from the lineage tracing strategy, most of the cells were MOLs, OPCs and committed OL precursors. Nevertheless, other populations, in particular astrocytes and microglia, were also captured (Fig. 1c–e).

We observed that a subset of MOLs transitioned to transcriptional/epigenomic states distinct from CFA-Ctrl at early stages of EAE, when lesions are just starting to develop (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Moreover, a minority of MOLs retained peak-stage-like profiles at late stages, while most MOLs transitioned to CFA-Ctrl-like states, suggesting a return to homeostasis (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Because disease-associated OLG states at peak EAE are characterized by chromatin accessibility and the expression of immune genes4,13, we investigated whether the observed transitions were driven by their immune status. We subsetted and reclustered OPCs and MOLs to identify those expressing immune-related genes13 (Fig. 2a and Methods). Immune OLG (imOLG) were hardly observed in CFA-Ctrl mice, but were found in mice with EAE, with a higher percentage present at the peak stage than in the early and late stages (early stage 26.80%, peak stage 66.91% and late stage 32.41%; Fig. 2c). Chromatin accessibility at the promoter/gene body of the same immune genes identified a lower number of imOLG than by immune gene expression (early 14.69%, peak stage 37.71% and late stage 17.81%; Fig. 2b,d). This is most likely due to some OLG from CFA-Ctrl and Naive-Ctrl animals exhibiting already primed chromatin accessibility in immune gene loci but with low or no expression4,13, which made the cutoff value of immune status depicted from gene chromatin accessibility higher than from expression. Thus, our data indicate that the transition of both OPCs and MOLs to immune-like states at epigenomic and transcriptional levels occurs at early stages of EAE, when lesions are just starting to develop, and persists at late stages, despite resolving inflammation.

Source Data

The expression and chromatin accessibility of some major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I- and MHC class II-related genes were previously shown to be increased in EAE-specific OLG at peak stages of EAE4,13. Here, we found that, overall, the expression level of MHC class II genes was lower than that of MHC class I genes (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Notably, the expression of β-chain of MHC class I molecules (B2m), histocompatibility 2, K region locus 1 (H2-K1) and NLR family CARD domain-containing 5 (Nlrc5) was increased in EAE OLG at early stages (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). We identified MOL1, MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6 mature OLG subpopulations (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a–d). We observed that the increase in expression of MHC class I and MHC class II genes at early stages was more expressive in OPCs than in MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6 (Extended Data Fig. 2b). The chromatin of some of the MHC class I genomic loci was accessible in OLG from CFA-Ctrl animals and exhibited a further increase in the early stages of EAE (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). By contrast, MHC class II genes had no or low expression in OLG from CFA-Ctrl mice and showed increased expression and chromatin accessibility in OPCs at early stages of EAE, but only at the peak stage for MOLs (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). A few MHC class I genes such as B2m, histocompatibility 2, D region locus 1 (H2-D1) and H2-K1 remained highly expressed at late EAE stages, while the expression of most other MHC class I and MHC class II genes was notably downregulated compared to at the peak stage. Nevertheless, chromatin accessibility at the promoter/gene body of both MHC class I and MHC class II genes remained high at the late stage (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2a–c). Thus, OLG exhibit persistent chromatin accessibility of specific immune genes at late stages of EAE. Because inflammation is decreased at these stages, this chromatin accessibility persistence in OLG might result from either epigenetic memory of peak immune-like states or from a mild inflammatory environment at late stages.

To investigate whether a possible immune epigenetic memory in OPCs enhances immune characteristics after re-exposure to inflammatory stimuli, we treated primary mouse neonatal OPCs and the mouse OLG precursor cell line Oli-neu18 with IFNγ, either once or twice with a 96-h interval without IFNγ between treatments (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3e). RNA-seq and ATAC-seq were conducted 24 h after the first or second IFNγ treatment. We observed that there was a large number of genes for which chromatin accessibility around their transcription start sites (TSSs; Supplementary Table 1) and their potential enhancers (Supplementary Table 1) was maintained or kept at a relatively higher level, in the absence of IFNγ for 96 h, after treatment with this cytokine. Many of these genes, such as H2-Ab1, H2-K1 and H2-D1, retained chromatin accessibility in OPC populations but also in MOL populations in late-stage EAE (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2b), suggesting epigenetic memory in this MS model. Moreover, some of these genes also exhibited a further increase in chromatin accessibility after the second IFNγ treatment (Fig. 2g,h and Supplementary Table 1). One of the possible functional outcomes of this epigenetic memory could be increased expression of these genes after a second bout of neuroinflammation. Indeed, a specific subset of the genes presenting unaltered chromatin accessibility around the TSS and/or enhancers exhibited elevated expression in OPCs after exposure to the second dose of IFNγ compared to OPCs after one dose of IFNγ treatment (Fig. 2g,h and Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, in the Oli-neu cell line, quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) analysis revealed increased expression of specific genes within the MHC pathway, such as Nlcr5, H2-D1, H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, B2m and class II MHC transactivator (Ciita), when comparing the two IFNγ treatments to a single IFNγ treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3e). These results from cultured neonatal OPCs suggest that OPCs might retain, at the level of chromatin accessibility, epigenetic memory of a previous neuroinflammatory insult, which might make them more prone to transcriptionally reactivate an immunological profile. However, additional studies are needed to determine whether a similar epigenetic memory phenomenon occurs in adult OPCs and MOLs, given their distinct transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles.

Our multiome data suggested that imOLG are present not only at the peak stage but also at the early and late stages of EAE. We thus used RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) to understand where these imOLG were located relative to EAE lesions. We defined lesions as white matter regions with a high number of cells due to inflammatory infiltrates (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Consistent with the multiome results, the MHC class II+ OLG (Sox10+H2-Ab1+) were observed in EAE spinal cord sections from the peak stage but also in early and late stages, albeit in different proportions (Fig. 2i,j and quantification in the Methods). There was no significant difference in the percentages of imOLG between lesion and nonlesion areas for all three stages (Fig. 2j; P > 0.05). Consistent with previous observations4, we confirmed the presence of imOLG at the protein level by immunostaining against MHC class II (I-A/I-E), along with SOX10 (GFP; Extended Data Fig. 3g). Together, our data indicate that MHC class I and MHC class II genes maintain latent transcriptional and epigenetic states in OLG at late EAE stages, which may result in immune gene expression when facing recurrent inflammatory stimuli and contribute to the chronic persistent disease state.

MOLs have recently been shown to be heterogeneous, with specific populations exhibiting regional preferences and different susceptibility to spinal cord injury4,7,13,14,19,20. Based on distinct gene expression profiles within OLG, we could further subdivide OPCs into three (OPC-α–OPC-γ), MOL2 into five (MOL2-α–MOL2-ε) and MOL5/MOL6 into ten cell states/subpopulations (MOL5/MOL6-α–MOL5/MOL6-κ; Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4a). Interestingly, most of these states display prevalence toward specific EAE time points (Fig. 3a–c) and present specific expression of gene modules (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 2). Overall, we observed a higher proportion of MOL2 at the peak and late stages of EAE than CFA-Ctrl and early-stage EAE (Fig. 3b–d). This increase could arise from conversion of MOL5/MOL6 into MOL2, being more resilient to the neuroinflammatory environment, and/or preferential differentiation of OPCs into MOL2 in the context of EAE. We then investigated whether any of these MOL populations were more prone to transition into immune-like states in EAE. In total, 38.35% of MOL2 were identified as imOLG, whereas only 18.75% of MOL5/MOL6 underwent this transition (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 4d), indicating that MOL2 has higher immune responsiveness. Within the identified immune-related genes, some were more enriched in specific MOL populations, whereas others, involved, for instance, in cytokine and T cell immune responses, showed similar expression levels among all MOLs (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 4c). Overall, our results suggest that MOL2 exhibit a stronger immune response to the neuroinflammatory environment than MOL5/MOL6 and may play a more important role in disease progress.

In addition to the immune response, the disease-associated profile of OLG can also include a damage-associated response, which is related to apoptosis and survival mechanisms8,21. We found that the majority of OLG at the peak stage expressed high levels of both damage- and IFN-associated genes, whereas a subset of cells from the early and late stages expressed either damage- or IFN-associated profiles (Fig. 3g,h). By contrast, chromatin accessibility showed a stronger specificity in either damage- or IFN-associated genes (Fig. 3i), suggesting that the chromatin accessibility of these IFN- or damage-associated genes was already reduced at the peak stage, despite their transcription. A higher percentage of MOL2 displayed both damage- and IFN-associated profiles than MOL5/MOL6 at peak and late stages (Extended Data Fig. 4e). At the late stage, a greater proportion of MOL2 exhibited a damage-associated profile, whereas MOL5/MOL6 showed a higher prevalence of IFN-associated profiles. Additionally, we identified a subset of OPCs at the late stage that did not express either damage- or IFN-associated profiles (Fig. 3f,g), suggesting that these OPCs may have a nondisease phenotype and could potentially contribute to remyelination at the chronic stage of disease. Similar to immune-related genes, fewer damage- and IFN-associated OLG were identified by chromatin accessibility than gene expression (Fig. 3h,i and Extended Data Fig. 4e,f).

To explore whether other biological processes were dynamically modulated in OLG during the course of EAE, we performed differential gene expression analysis across the different stages in different OLG cell types (Methods). The differentially expressed genes were divided into Type 1 (high expression in CFA-Ctrl), Type 2 (high expression at the early stage), Type 3 (high expression at the peak stage) and Type IV (high expression at the late stage) main types and also subtypes (high expression in a main type associated with high expression in a secondary type; Fig. 4a,b and Extended Data Fig. 5a).

The black column on the right represents the raw gene counts. The line plots represent the mean of the normalized and scaled gene expression (line in brown), chromatin accessibility at the promoter and gene bodies (line in purple) and chromatin accessibility at enhancer regions (line in green) of genes in different groups. The color band associated with a line represents the standard deviation of the mean. Differentially expressed genes and associated GOs are shown in Supplementary Table 3 and 4. c, Normalized chromatin accessibility (left of each gene panel) and log2 expression (right of each gene panel) of genes related to the cholesterol biosynthetic process (Scd1, Idi1, Dhcr24 and Fdft1) in MOL5/MOL6 (left) and MOL2 (right).

In OPCs, we observed an increase in IFN and cytokine signaling at early and peak stages (secondary subtype division Type 2–Type 3), and, as expected, genes related to antigen processing cross-presentation were increased in expression at the peak stage (Type 3), followed by a notable reduction at the late stage (Extended Data Fig. 5a and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Furthermore, genes related to neuronal system and development, albeit not significant in Gene Ontology (GO) terms, such as doublecortin (Dcx) and glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (Grip1), were upregulated at the late stage (Type 4) in OPCs (Extended Data Fig. 5a and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). OPCs showed a drastic reduction of immune-associated cells at the gene expression level and, to some extent, at the chromatin level at the late stage of EAE compared to all other time points and MOL populations (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). However, many of these genes retained chromatin accessibility, suggesting that they retain the epigenetic potential to initiate their transcription.

Consistent with OPCs, the differentially expressed genes of MOL5/MOL6 were also divided into four distinct types and subtypes (Fig. 4a). Most of the genes with high expression at the peak stage (Type 3) in MOL5/MOL6 were immune related, such as antigen processing/cross-presentation (Psmb8, Psmb9 and Tap1), but their expression decreased drastically at the late stage (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). We observed an increase of interleukin signaling genes in MOL5/MOL6 (Type 2) at the early stage (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). We found an increase in cholesterol biosynthetic process-related genes at early stages (Type 2 subtype 1), such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (Scd1), isopentenyl-diphosphate-δ isomerase 1 (Idi1), 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (Dhcr24), farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (Fdft1), squalene epoxidase (Sqle), farnesyl-diphosphate synthase (Fdps) and methylsterol monooxygenase 1 (Msmo1) in MOL5/MOL6. This increase in cholesterol-related pathway genes was also found in early stages (Type 2 subtype 1) in OPCs (Fig. 4a,c and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). The formation of the myelin sheath necessitates highly coordinated levels of fatty acid and lipid synthesis process-related genes22. MOLs have been recently shown to be able to contribute in some extent to remyelination23,24,25,26. The increase in expression of cholesterol biosynthesis-related genes at the initial stage could suggest a form of preliminary remyelination adaptation to the very first cues given by EAE-driven demyelination (Extended Data Fig. 5d). At the late stage (Type 4), we observed the increased expression of genes in MOL5/MOL6 involved in extracellular matrix degradation and collagen chain trimerization, suggesting simultaneous matrix degradation and synthesis for tissue repair during chronic phases of the disease. We also observed increased expression of genes involved in the RHO GTPase cycle in MOL5/MOL6 at a secondary subtype division at late and early stages (Type 4 subtype 2), such as STEAP3 metalloreductase (Steap3) and copine 8 (Cpne8; Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) involved in actin cytoskeleton and microtubule processes, which play a role in myelination27, further suggesting that MOL5/MOL6 might activate gene regulatory programs associated with regeneration during these stages.

We also identified four groups and subgroups of genes with differential expression between different time points for MOL2 (Fig. 4b). Similar to MOL5/MOL6, we found that cholesterol biosynthetic process-related genes also had a transitory increase in MOL2 at early-stage EAE compared to later stages (Fig. 4b,c and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Many genes with high expression in MOL2 at the peak stage were immune-related genes (Type 3, such as Tap1, histocompatibility 2, T region locus 23 (H2-T23), integrin subunit-α 9 (Itga9) and Psmb8, which is consistent with the exacerbated immune response and higher number of imOLG at the peak stage (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Interestingly, we also found that genes related to development and axon guidance, different from Type 1 genes, exhibited high expression in MOL2 at the late stage, such as plexin A4 (Plxna4), but also semaphorin 3B (Sema3b), EPH receptor (Ephb2 and Epha10) and ankyrin 1 (Ank1; Fig. 4b and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). In summary, our multiome data indicate that MOL2 initiate, as MOL5/MOL6, a cholesterol biosynthesis program in response to the arising neuroinflammatory environment but transition to an immune-like state during the course of EAE.

We then explored expression differences between MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6 at each time point (Methods and Supplementary Table 5). At the peak stage of EAE, we identified 352 genes with increased expression in MOL2 compared to MOL5/MOL6 (Extended Data Fig. 5e), many of which were associated with immune responses and apoptotic processes, including Ciita, Gbp5, Jun and death-associated protein (Dap; Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). This finding supports that MOL2 exhibit a stronger immune profile than MOL5/MOL6. For MOL5/MOL6, we observed 80 genes with increased expression across different time points (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Among these, we identified several genes related to the neuronal system but also cell development, such as meis homeobox 2 (Meis2), neuroligin 3 (Nlgn3) and Sema6a, at early stages (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).

Differences between MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6 at the transcriptional level might correlate with changes at the epigenetic level. We thus compared the list of genes with differential chromatin accessibility at promoter/gene body regions and genes with differential expression across different stages and found that multiple genes showed notable changes in both expression and chromatin accessibility (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 7). Most were immune related (Fig. 5b, Extended Data Fig. 5g,h and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). This indicated that immune-related genes tend to have important changes in both gene expression and chromatin accessibility at promoter/gene body regions in all OLG populations.

The color band associated with a line represents the standard deviation of the mean. Differential chromatin accessibility at promoters/gene bodies and associated GOs are shown in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. e,f, Normalized chromatin accessibility of immune system process-related genes (Ido1, C1ra and Isg20) in MOL2 (e) and MOL5/MOL6 (f) at each time point.

We then explored the dynamics of chromatin accessibility both at promoters/gene bodies and at associated distant enhancer regulatory regions during the disease course. Gene loci displaying differential chromatin accessibility at promoter/gene body regions between different time points were divided into high chromatin accessibility in CFA-Ctrl (Type 1), early stage (Type 2), peak stage (Type 3) and late stage (Type 4; Fig. 5c,d). Very few genes could be found in Type 1 in MOLs and none could be found in OPCs (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 5i). In both OPCs and MOLs, most genes with differential chromatin and enhancer accessibility reached their highest levels of accessibility during the peak stage, with the association of immune-related functions (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Of note, a predominance in accessibility at genes associated with collagen biosynthesis and extracellular matrix organization was described in MOL5/MOL6 compared to MOL2 at late stages of EAE (Fig. 5c,d and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).

When comparing MOL2 to MOL5/MOL6, we found that there was a group of antigen processing/presentation with high chromatin accessibility at the peak stage in both MOL2 and MOL5/6 (Extended Data Fig. 5j,k and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Moreover, we found that more immune-related genes were upregulated in MOL2 than in MOL5/MOL6 at the peak stage. Some immune system process-related genes, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (Ido1), complement component 1, r subcomponent A (C1ra) and IFN-stimulated exonuclease gene 20 (Isg20) showed increased chromatin accessibility at the peak stage in MOL2 but not in MOL5/MOL6 (Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4), further indicating that MOL2 triggers a more robust opening of the chromatin at immune genes after EAE than MOL5/MOL6.

Recently, superenhancers, clusters with high levels of transcription factor binding and domains of regulatory chromatin (DORCs), have been suggested to have key roles in modulating gene expression12. Genes associated with DORCs were characterized by exceptionally large (five or more) numbers of significant peak–gene associations (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). To explore the role of DORCs in the course of EAE, we defined differentially accessible domain-regulated genes in OLG subpopulations (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 6c). We found three types of DORCs in MOL5/MOL6, among which only 2 domains were classified as Type 1 (high activity at the early stage), 49 domains were classified as Type 2 (high activity at the peak stage), and 24 domains were classified as Type 3 (high activity at the late stage; Fig. 6a). By contrast, we only found Type 2 (high activity at the peak stage) DORCs in MOL2. Type 2 DORCs in both MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6 were associated with genes involved in immune processes, with Gbp7, IFN regulatory factor 4 (Irf4) and Irgm1 included (Fig. 6a,b and Supplementary Table 3). For OPCs, 3 Type 1 DORCs and 49 Type 2 DORCs were identified, with many of them being immune related (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Table 3).

a, Heat maps of normalized and scaled DORC scores of differentially expressed genes (DESeq2 Wald test and Benjamini–Hochberg multiple testing correction with a log2 (FC) of >1 and adjusted P value of <0.01) at different stages, 124 genes in MOL2 and 75 genes in MOL5/MOL6. DORCs were classified into three types: Type 1 with high activity in early-stage EAE, Type 2 with increased activity at the peak stage and Type 3 with increased activity at the late stage. Differential DORCs and associated GOs are shown in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. b, Representative gene (Irgm1) in Type 2 DORCs in MOL2 (top) and MOL5/MOL6 (bottom).

UMAP coordinates and population distributions are as in Fig. 3a. e, Normalized chromatin accessibility of Hoxa (top) and Hoxb (bottom) genes in MOL5/MOL6; the gray box highlights Hoxb genes in d.

The presence of two additional DORC types (Types 1 and 3) in MOL5/MOL6 suggests that additional biological processes are regulated in this mature OL subtype compared to MOL2 (Fig. 6c). In particular, at this stage, we found increased DORCs regulating a group of homeobox (Hoxb) genes, such as Hoxb2, Hoxb3 and Hoxb4, in MOL5/MOL6 but not MOL2 (Fig. 6c–e, Extended Data Fig. 6d,e and Supplementary Table 3). Interestingly, only a subset of MOL5/MOL6, a subpopulation of MOL5/MOL6-ζ, mainly from late-stage EAE, was driving the upregulation of DORCs of Hoxb genes (Fig. 6d). By contrast, all subtypes of OPCs present high DORC scores across all time points (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 6d). The increased activity was only found in Hoxb but not in other HOX family gene regions (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 6e). HOXB2 is essential for OL patterning28. Thus, the increased chromatin accessibility of these developmental-related DORCs suggests that MOL5/MOL6 might have primed transcriptional programs compatible with nervous system repair and remyelination and promotion during the late stages of EAE.

Although RNA velocity leverages splicing and RNA turnover to infer cellular transitional dynamics29, another key component for these dynamics are changes in the epigenomic landscape during cell transitions. To explore dynamics of OLG during disease, we applied MultiVelo30, a tool that integrates transcriptomics and epigenomics datasets to estimate cell-fate predictions. For a given gene, this tool can define the state of each cell into one of the following four phases: priming (brown), coupled-on (pink), decoupling (dark blue) and coupled-off (light blue; Methods, Fig. 7a and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b)30. Due to the limited number of OPCs, some genes of interest did not present a complete transcriptional trajectory using MultiVelo (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). We found that canonical OLG genes, such as Opalin, contactin 1 (Cntn1) and neuron navigator 1 (Nav1), showed coupled-on phases in MOL5/MOL6 in both CFA-Ctrl mice and in mice with EAE from early to late stages (Fig. 7c,d,f). However, many of these nervous system development-related genes exhibited either a priming or coupled-off phase in MOL2 (Fig. 7b,d,f). Thus, similar to our previous results, Multivelo analysis suggests a differential regenerative response of MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6 in the context of EAE. By contrast, immune-related genes, such as B2m, H2-D1 and Stat1, were observed to transition between the coupled-on and decoupling phases in most MOL2 cells, which indicated a highly open chromatin level and transcription (Fig. 7b,e). However, these immune genes showed a chromatin priming phase in MOL5/MOL6 in CFA-Ctrl animals, followed by a transient coupled-on phase at early-stage EAE. At the peak and late stages, B2m and H2-D1 transitioned into a coupled-off phase, indicating an important reduction in chromatin accessibility and gene expression of these immune-related genes at the chronic stage of the disease (Fig. 7c,e). Transition to an immune-like state has been previously shown to be incompatible with differentiation in OPCs5, and our data suggest that in MOL in EAE the enhanced immune-like state of MOL2 cells is distinct to a putative more remyelination-prone state of MOL5/MOL6 cells. Thus, these results further indicate a divergence in the response of different MOL populations to the evolving disease environment in EAE.

To obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms mediating the divergent OLG responses in the different stages of EAE, we inferred the global gene regulatory network (GRN)31 for OPCs and MOL5/MOL6 and MOL2. We observed changes in the activity of the predicted transcription factors between the different stages of EAE (Fig. 8a–c, Extended Data Fig. 8a–d and Methods). We had previously found that the transcription factor BACH1 negatively regulated the induction of immune-related genes mediated by IFNγ13. Interestingly, we observed that its related transcription repressor BACH2 has more activity in CFA-Ctrl mice then in any EAE stage in both MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6 populations (Fig. 8a–c and Extended Data Fig. 8a–d). At early stages of EAE, we found higher activity of NKX6.2 in both MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6, which might be consistent with the transitory regenerative responses observed at early stages. NKX6.2 has an important role in oligodendrogenesis and myelination32,33,34 and has been recently shown to drive OLG specification from induced pluripotent stem cells35,36. We also found that STAT3, which has immunosuppression potential37,38, showed higher positive activity in MOL5/MOL6 from the early stage, while at the peak stage in MOL2 and OPCs (Fig. 8a,c and Extended Data Fig. 8c)13.

Source Data

We identified 26 transcription factors in MOL5/MOL6 and 23 transcription factors in MOL2, acting mainly with positive activities at the late stage. Among these transcription factors were TCF4, RUNX2, myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) and POU homodomain transcription factors (Fig. 8a,b), with functions in nervous system development. In particular within MOL5/MOL6-predicted transcription factors, we found an increased number of candidates related to nervous system development at the late stage, including nuclear factor I A (NFIA) and TCF12, which are involved in the regulation of OL differentiation and maturation39,40,41 (Fig. 8b). Some transcription factors regulating cell differentiation, such as SOX4, were also found to mainly act at the late stage compared to other stages in MOL5/MOL6 (Fig. 8b). However, unlike in MOL5/MOL6, the differentiation-related factors TCF7L2 (ref. 42) and SOX4 exhibited the highest activity from the peak stage in OPCs (Extended Data Fig. 8c), suggesting that early CNS regeneration may already be initiated. These results further underscore differential regenerative potential of OLG during the late stages of the disease.

STAT3 is a transcription factor that can be involved in immune suppression by, for instance, the upregulation of PD-L1 expression43,44. PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint protein whose immune-suppressing effects have been observed across a broad range of cell types45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55. We found that both the expression and chromatin accessibility of Cd274 (which encodes PD-L1) were increased at early and peak stages in OPCs and MOLs (Extended Data Fig. 9a). The increase of PD-L1 expression may thus be stalling the autoimmune response during the early and peak stages of the disease. To investigate whether STAT3 regulates PD-L1 expression in OLG, we knocked down Stat3 expression using short interfering RNA (siRNA) or inhibited its activity with the inhibitor auranofin56,57 in primary cultured neonatal OPCs. We found that both Stat3 siRNA and auranofin effectively inhibited Stat3 expression following IFNγ treatment. This inhibition also resulted in reduced Cd274 expression in response to IFNγ (Fig. 8d and Extended Data Fig. 8e). Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis revealed a decrease in PD-L1 protein expression in OPCs treated with Stat3 siRNA (Fig. 8e). These findings suggest that certain immune suppression-related genes may be upregulated in OLGs during EAE in response to the inflammatory milieu, attempting to attenuate and regulate the immune response.

The immune plasticity of OLG was first reported about 40 years ago58. In addition, MHC class I and MHC class II expression in OLG under inflammatory conditions was further observed in many subsequent studies59,60,61,62. Recently, with the emergence of single-cell transcriptomics, the concept of imOLG has been further expanded to neuroinflammation in the context of MS, Alzheimer's disease and aging in several studies4,5,8,62,63. We have recently shown that MHC and other immune-associated genes are highly expressed in EAE at the peak stage, with primed chromatin accessibility of some of these genes already in CFA-Ctrl animals4,13. In the current study, we applied multiomics scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq to comprehensively profile OLG cellular states throughout EAE, from onset to chronic stages. Our results show that several immune-related genes and their chromatin accessibility levels are already elevated in OLG, in particular in OPCs, at the early stage of EAE, when symptoms start emerging. Furthermore, these loci remain highly accessible even in the late disease stage.

Immune-like OLG emerge early in EAE, before lesions are fully developed64. We also observe that the percentage of MHC class II+ OLG is similar inside and outside lesions, suggesting that the lesion environment is not essential for the transition of OLG to immune-like states. These findings are consistent with spatiotemporal transcriptomics analysis in EAE, indicating that disease-associated glia can be induced independent of lesions and that the disease-associated MOLs are in close proximity to disease-associated microglia and astrocytes64. Thus, it is plausible that the induction of imOLG might be mediated not only by infiltrating immune cells but also by other disease-associated glia or inflammatory environmental factors.

The presence of imOLG at all stages of EAE could suggest differential functions at distinct time points. We observed that only a small percentage of Sox10+ cells express MHC class II genes. However, even minimal expression can have substantial functional implications. In MS and EAE, OLG are direct targets of the autoimmune response within the CNS. MHC class II expression in OLG might enable them to present antigens and activate CD4⁺ T cells, positioning OLG at the forefront of disease onset and progression. Nevertheless, our results showed immune-repressive pathway activation in MOLs at EAE early and peak stages, aligning with previous findings that OPCs and MOLs express PD-L1 (ref. 13). Thus, MOLs could, in principle, activate or, alternatively, block immune responses in the context of EAE. At the early stages, immune MOLs might act by modulating (preventing or initiating/amplifying) the initial neuroinflammatory events underlying the etiology of the disease. At peak stages, given the presence of high numbers of professional antigen-presenting cells, such as microglia and macrophages, the role of immune MOLs might be more subtle and modulatory of the function of these other immune cells. We observe the persistence of MHC class I and MHC class II in OLG in the late stages of EAE, when imOLG might be involved in disease persistence, although a role in reducing inflammatory responses is also possible.

IFNγ treatment of human HeLa cells has been shown to lead to long-term transcriptional memory65. Moreover, epigenetic memory of previous inflammatory events has also been observed in mouse epidermal stem cells66,67. Disease-associated astrocytes have also been suggested to present epigenetic memory following neuroinflammation68, and obesity has also been reported to lead to epigenetic memory in adipocytes, including genes involved in inflammatory signaling69. Here, we found that OLG can also retain memory of previous inflammatory insults at a chromatin accessibility level. In the most common course of MS, individuals with relapsing–remitting MS suffer from multiple remissions and relapses over the course of the disease, and the symptoms can worsen after each relapse1. Therefore, the observed epigenetic memory of immune-related genes in OPCs may contribute to faster and stronger immune gene expression following the next wave of stimulation during the relapse stage in individuals with MS. This immune epigenetic memory in OLG may contribute to the chronicity of the disease and the difficulty in treating demyelinating diseases.

The heterogeneity of the OL lineage in development has been reported in our previous study19, and several subsequent studies have further confirmed the transcriptional and spatial preferences of distinct subpopulations of OL in development and disease4,7,14,20. In our analysis, we identified previously reported mature resting subtypes. The percentage of cells with an immune profile was higher in MOL2 than in MOL5/MOL6. The expression of immune-related genes in MOL5/MOL6 decreased considerably at the late stage compared to the early stages. Together, the immune characteristics of MOL2 in the spinal cord of mice with EAE are stronger than those of MOL5/MOL6. MOL5/MOL6 are more enriched in the gray matter of the spinal cord, whereas MOL2 are more preferentially located within the white matter of the spinal cord, where immune infiltrates and lesions are the most prominent14,70. The difference in the domain distribution between MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6, in combination with intrinsic factors, may thus contribute to the heterogeneity of MOL in response to the inflammatory environment and higher immune characteristics of MOL2.

We observed notable disparities in CNS development functions between MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6. We saw that some genes related to CNS development always stay in a coupled-on stage in MOL5/MOL6 but not in MOL2, which suggests a more central role of MOL5/MOL6 in myelin maintenance and stability than MOL2 in disease, especially at the chronic stage. However, our results do not provide a definitive answer regarding whether MOL5/MOL6 at the late stages are newly generated or resilient cells that were already present before disease development. One hypothesis is that MOL5/MOL6 are newly generated and possess a stronger ability for CNS development. Alternatively, it is still possible that these MOL5/MOL6 survive in a severe inflammatory environment and contribute to remyelination once the inflammation in the CNS is diminished. To address this question, lineage tracing experiments need to be conducted in future studies.

Our study provides a unique resource for understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying the gene regulation and chromatin accessibility of OLG in the context of MS using an animal model. In particular, our study sheds light on the distinct fates of MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6 during disease evolution, indicating that therapeutic strategies targeting MOLs need to be specific for the different populations. The road to fully understand the complex interplay of transcriptomics and epigenomics in MS requires further exploration, such as spatial resolution, which may provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the disease.

Although our multiome analysis gives insights into the epigenetic potential and memory in OLG during the time course of the disease, at the onset of the disease, the inclusion of intermediate time points might allow further granularity and uncovering of additional cellular states in OLG. We also show that OPCs in vitro can acquire epigenetic memory in the form of chromatin accessibility at immune-related genes. Although it is possible that this epigenetic memory occurs in MOLs, it is challenging to assess this in vitro due to cell death of MOLs after prolonged culture in vitro. Future studies might elucidate whether this epigenetic memory also occurs in adult OPCs and MOLs in vivo and whether it plays a role after the second inflammatory challenge, as, for instance, in relapsing–remitting EAE models. The observed priming of OL differentiation and myelination gene programs in MOL5/MOL6, particularly at the early stages of EAE, suggest that there might be a window of opportunity for the promotion of MOL-associated remyelination in MS. Nevertheless, our results indicate only potential given the nature of epigenomic data, and it is thus unclear whether it is possible to harness this MOL capability to promote remyelination. A deeper analysis of the epigenetic landscape at a single-cell level by examining, for instance, activating and repressive histone modifications71 or DNA methylation might further elucidate mechanisms that could lead to the activation of these gene programs and promote remyelination in the context of MS.

The present study followed some applicable aspects of the PREPARE and ARRIVE72,73 planning guidelines checklist such as the formulation of the in vivo study, dialog between scientists and the animal facility and quality control of the in vivo components in the study. All animals were born, bred, housed and subjected to experimental treatment at Karolinska Institutet, Comparative Medicine Biomedicum animal facility for research on small rodents (KM-B). Sox10:cre-RCE:loxP (eGFP) transgenic mice were used in this study and were originally obtained by crossing mice with Cre recombinase under the control of the Sox10 promoter (The Jackson Laboratories, 025807; with a C57BL/6 genetic background) with reporter mice RCE:loxP-EGFP (with a CD1 background, 32037-JAX) to label the complete OL lineage. Breedings were performed with cre allele females and non-cre carrier males, with one male and up to two females. Breeding males carrying a hemizygous cre allele, along with the reporter allele, with non-cre females was avoided because it resulted in progeny expressing eGFP in all cells. Mice included in the experiment were heterozygotes and between 9 and 13 weeks old; both males and females were included. None of the experimental animals in this study were subjected to previous procedures. The following housing conditions were used: dawn 06:00–07:00, daylight 07:00–18:00, dusk 18:00–19:00 and night 19:00–06:00. A maximum of five adult mice was housed per individually ventilated cage of type II (IVC seal safe GM500, Tecniplast). All animals were free from mouse viral pathogens, ectoparasites and endoparasites and mouse bacteria pathogens. Animal health surveillance was performed every third month according to the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Association recommendations74. Three basic and one complete Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Association tests were performed per year (health monitoring was performed via PCR on exhaust air filter dust and by serology from sentinel animals). General housing parameters, such as relative humidity, temperature and ventilation, followed the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes Treaty ETS 123, Strasbourg 18.03.1996/01.01.1991. Briefly, a relative air humidity of 55% ± 10% and temperature of 22 °C were maintain, and air quality was controlled with the use of stand-alone air handling units supplemented with HEPA-filtrated air. Monitoring of husbandry parameters was performed using ScanClime (Scanbur) units. Cages contained hardwood bedding (TAPVEI), nesting material, shredded paper, gnawing sticks and card box shelter (Scanbur). The mice received a regular chow diet (R70 or R34, Lantmännen Lantbruk or CRM(P) SDS or CRM(P), SAFE). Water was provided by using a water bottle, which was changed weekly (water quality was assessed by 1SO 6222, SS EN-ISO 9308-2:2014 and SS EN-ISO 14189:2016 methods, Eurofins). Cages were changed once every week. All cage changes were performed in a laminar air flow cabinet (NinoSafe MCCU mobile cage changing unit) provided with a HEPA H14 EN1822 filter (0.3-μm particle size). Facility personnel wore dedicated scrubs, socks and shoes. Respiratory masks were used when working outside of the laminar air flow cabinet. Animals of both sexes were assigned to different experimental groups by randomization using the GraphPad randomization tool (GraphPad by Dotmatics).

All experimental procedures on animals were performed following the European Directive 2010/63/EU, local Swedish directive L150/SJVFS/2019:9, Saknr L150 and Karolinska Institutet complementary guidelines for procurement and use of laboratory animals (Dnr. 1937/03-640) and Karolinska Institutet Comparative Medicine veterinary guidelines and plans (version 2020/12/18). The procedures described were approved by the local committee for ethical experiments on laboratory animals in Sweden (Stockholms Norra Djurförsöksetiska nämnd), license numbers 1995-2019 and 7029-2020.

For EAE induction, animals were injected subcutaneously with an emulsion of MOG35–55 in CFA (Hooke Laboratories, EK-2110; containing 1 mg of MOG35–55 per ml emulsion and 2–5 mg of killed mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra per ml emulsion, Hooke Laboratories), followed by the intraperitoneal injection of pertussis toxin (Hooke Laboratories, included in the induction kits) in 1× PBS (Gibco, 10010023) on days 0 and 1 (200–225 ng per animal, adjusted by lot according to the manufacturer's instructions). Scores of EAE were graded according to the following criteria: 0, asymptomatic; 1, limp tail or titubation; 2, limp tail and weakness of hindlimbs; 3, limp tail and complete paralysis of hindlimbs; 4, limp tail, complete paralysis of two hindlimbs with forelimb involvement; 5, moribund or dead; 0.5 for intermediate symptoms. Investigators were not blinded to group allocation and were aware of whether animals were assigned to the control or EAE group during both experimentation and outcome assessment. Accordingly, data collection and analysis were not blindly performed to the conditions of the experiments.

CFA-Ctrl mice were injected subcutaneously with control emulsion containing CFA but without MOG35–55 (Hooke Laboratories, CK-2110), followed by the administration of pertussis toxin in PBS on days 0 and 1 (200–225 ng per animal, adjusted by lot according to the manufacturer's instructions). Spinal cords from mice with EAE were collected at the (1) early stage (days 8–9 after injection, score of 0–0.5, 14 mice in 7 multiome experiments), (2) peak stage (days 14–15, score of 3, 10 mice in 5 multiome experiments) or (3) late/chronic stage (days 37–40, score of 2–2.5, 14 mice in 6 multiome experiments). Spinal cord samples from CFA-Ctrl mice were also collected from the same stages (early stage, peak stage and late stage) with a score of 0 (at least four mice in two multiome experiments for each stage), alongside spinal cord tissues from noninduced Naive-Ctrl animals (3-month-old mice from the same strain, six mice in three multiome experiments). Scores for mice with EAE and CFA-Ctrl mice were plotted using GraphPad Prism version 9.0.0.

At the early, peak and late stages, mice were perfused with cold PBS, and spinal cords were collected. Spinal cord tissues were then dissociated into a single-cell suspension according to the manufacturer's protocol for the Adult Brain Dissociation kit, mouse and rat (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-107-677; we did not perform the red blood cell removal step because the majority of red blood cells had been removed after PBS perfusion). For the debris removal step, most of the samples were processed with 38% Percoll except two Naive-Ctrl samples, two EAE peak-stage samples and two EAE late-stage samples, which were processed with debris removal solution (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-107-677) according to the manufacturer's protocol, to enrich more OPCs. Spinal cord single eGFP+ cells were enriched with a BD FACS Aria III Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences).

The cells were then lysed and washed according to the demonstrated protocol for Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing (10x Genomics, CG000365), with the following modifications. Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 300g and 4 °C, resuspended in lysis buffer (containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Tween-20, 0.01% IGEPAL (CA-630), 0.001% digitonin, 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor) and incubated on ice for 3 min. After the incubation, wash buffer (containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor) was added on top without mixing. The nuclei were centrifuged for 5 min at 500g and 4 °C. Nuclei were washed once in wash buffer, followed by another wash with diluted 1× Nuclei buffer (10x Genomics, PN-1000283) containing 1% BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U μl−1 RNase inhibitor. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression chemistry (10x Genomics, PN-1000283) was then applied to yield single-cell ATAC and RNA libraries. Twenty-six mice with EAE (8 early-stage mice, 8 peak-stage mice and 10 late-stage mice), 12 CFA-Ctrl mice (4 early-stage mice, 4 peak-stage mice and 4 late-stage mice) and 4 Naive-Ctrl mice were used for independent replicates. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 with a 50–8–24–49 read setup for ATAC (minimum of 25,000 read pairs per cell) and a 28–10–10–90 read setup for RNA (minimum of 20,000 read pairs per cell).

Both male and female mice were used in our study. Most of the samples contained cells from one male mouse and one female mouse, except two early-stage EAE samples (one only contained male mice, another only contained female mice), two peak-stage EAE samples (one only contained male mice, another only contained female mice) and two late-stage EAE samples (one only contained male mice, another only contained female mice) for establishing a sex prediction model and validation.

RNAscope ISH was performed on 14-μm spinal cord sections from the lumbar spinal cord of control mice and mice with EAE (n = 3 for each condition) with probes for mouse Sox10 (ACD, 435931) and H2-Ab1 (ACD, 414731-C2). The RNAscope ISH protocol for sections was performed following the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications (RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Reagents v2, 323110). Tissue sections were incubated in 1× target retrieval reagent (RNAscope Target Retrieval Reagents, 322000) for 5 min at 98 °C, followed two 2-min washes with DNase/RNase-free water. The samples were then incubated with protease IV (RNAscope Protease III and Protease IV Reagents, 322340) at room temperature for 20 min, followed by two 2-min washes with DNase/RNase-free water. The sections were hybridized with probes (C1:C2/C3 in a 1:50 dilution) for 2 h at 40 °C and washed twice with wash buffer (RNAscope Wash Buffer Reagents, 310091). Amplification steps were performed by incubating with v2Amp1 (30 min), v2Amp2 (30 min) and v2Amp3 (15 min) (RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Detection Reagents v2, 323110) at 40 °C, with two 2-min washes with wash buffer in between steps. The sections were incubated with v2-HRP-C1 for 15 min at 40 °C, and after two 2-min washes with wash buffer, tyramide signal amplification (TSA)-conjugated fluorophores (1:1,500 dilution in TSA buffer; RNAscope Multiplex TSA Buffer, 322810) were added and incubated for 30 min at 40 °C. The sections were washed twice with wash buffer and incubated with HRP blocker for 30 min at 40 °C. The v2-HRP, TSA-conjugated fluorophore and HRP blocker steps were then repeated for C2 and C3 channels, if applicable. At the end, the sections were incubated with DAPI (Sigma, D9542; 1:5,000) for 5 min and washed with PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (VWR, 9005-64-5) for 2 min.

For immunohistochemistry, after blocking with 5% normal donkey serum (Sigma) in 0.3% PBS/Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature, spinal cord sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the following primary antibodies: anti-MHC class II (Invitrogen, 14-5321-85, rat 1:50, clone M5/114.15.2) and anti-GFP (Abcam, ab13970, chicken 1:200) diluted in PBS/0.05% Tween-20/2% normal donkey serum. After washing the sections with PBS/0.05% Tween-20, secondary Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibodies (goat anti-rat (for MHC class II, 1:1,000; Invitrogen, A21434) and goat anti-chicken (for GFP, 1:1,000; Abcam, ab150169)) diluted in PBS/0.05% Tween-20/2% normal donkey serum were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were counterstained with DAPI, mounted with mounting medium and maintained at 4 °C until further microscopic analysis.

Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope (RNAscope) and Zeiss LSM980 microscope (immunohistochemistry) and processed in Fiji/ImageJ. For RNAscope, six ×20 randomly selected fields per mouse (three from lesions and three from nonlesions) were chosen for quantification. The percentage of MHC class II+ OLG was significantly higher at the peak stage (lesion: 5.33 ± 0.23%, nonlesion: 5.32 ± 0.23%) than at both early stage (lesion: 0.49 ± 0.849; nonlesion: 0.384 ± 0.333%) and late stage (lesion: 2.54 ± 0.23; nonlesion: 2.71 ± 0.32%) in both lesion (P = 0.0001) and nonlesion (P = 0.0001) areas (Fig. 2j). A two-way ANOVA with a Tukey's multiple comparisons test was performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.0.0 for comparing the percentages of Sox10+H2-Ab1+ cells between different time points and between lesion and nonlesion.

Sox10:cre-RCE:loxP (eGFP) transgenic mice were used. The brains of postnatal days 3–6 pups were dissociated using a Neural Tissue Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-092-628), according to the manufacturer's protocol. OPCs were obtained with MACS with CD140a microbeads following the manufacturer's protocol (CD140a Microbead kit, Miltenyi Biotec, 130-101-547). Cells were seeded in poly-L-lysine-coated (Sigma, P4707) dishes and grown on OPC proliferation medium comprising DMEM/F-12/GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher, 10565018), N2 medium (Thermo Fisher, 17502048), penicillin–streptomycin (Thermo Fisher, 15140122), NeuroBrew (Miltenyi, 130-097-263), bFGF (40 ng ml−1; R&D, 233-FB) and PDGF-AA (20 ng ml−1; Peprotech, 315-17).

Oli-neu cells (obtained from J. Trotter, Johannes Gutenberg University) were seeded in poly-L-lysine-coated (Sigma, P4707) dishes and grown on proliferation medium comprising DMEM (Gibco, 41966029) supplemented with 1× N2 supplement (Thermo Fisher, 17502048), 1× penicillin–streptomycin–glutamine (Gibco, 10378016), 340 ng ml−1 T3 (Sigma, T6397), 400 ng ml−1 T4 (Sigma, 89430), 10 ng ml−1 bFGF (R&D, 233-FB), 1 ng ml−1 PDGF-BB (R&D, 520-BB) and 0.5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, 10500064).

For the 2× IFNγ treatment, primary OPCs (n = 2) and Oli-neu cells (n = 3) were initially treated with IFNγ (100 ng ml−1; R&D, 485-MI-100) for 24 h. Afterward, the cells were cultured in proliferation medium without IFNγ for 96 h, and then a second dose of IFNγ was administered for an additional 24 h. For the 1× IFNγ treatment, cells were treated with IFNγ only at the time when the 2× IFNγ-treated cells received their second dose. RNA extraction was performed using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, 74106), and RNA-seq libraries were prepared using Stranded Total RNA Prep, Ligation with Ribo-Zero Plus (Illumina, 20040525), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq X, with a 75–10–10–75 read setup.

RNA extraction was performed using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, 74106), followed by cDNA synthesis using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher, 4368814), according to the manufacturers' protocols. RT–qPCR was performed on a QuantStudio 5 using SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, 4385617; Supplementary Table 10). Relative gene expression was calculated using the change in cycling threshold (\({2}^{-\varDelta \varDelta \,{C}_{{\rm{t}}}}\)) method, normalizing to the housekeeping gene Gapdh.

ATAC-seq was performed as previously described11, with minor adaptations. For each condition, 50,000 primary OPCs were collected, washed with PBS and lysed with 50 μl of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL (CA-630), 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.01% digitonin) on ice for 3 min. After lysis, 1 ml of wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% Tween-20) was added, and the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 500g for 10 min at 4 °C. After aspirating the supernatant, the nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of transposition mix (25 μl of 2× TD buffer (Tagment DNA Buffer), 16.5 μl of PBS, 0.5 μl of 1% digitonin, 0.5 μl of 10% Tween-20, 2.5 μl of Tn5 Transposase (final 100 nM) and 5 μl of nuclease-free water) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a thermomixer with mixing at 1,000 rpm. The DNA was purified both before and after PCR using a Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq X with a 51–8–8–50 read setup.

For transcription factor knockdown, siGENOME SMARTpool nontargeting control siRNA (D-001206-13-05, Dharmacon) or siRNA targeting Stat3 (M-040794-00-0005, Dharmacon) was used, which contains a pool of four siRNAs. One milligram of siRNA was diluted in OPTIMEM (31985062, Gibco), mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (11668027, Invitrogen) and allowed to form complexes for 20 min at room temperature. Primary OPCs were then incubated with the siRNA complexes in OPTIMEM with N2 medium, NeuroBre, bFGF (40 ng ml−1) and PDGF-AA (20 ng ml&minu;1). After 72 h, IFNγ (100 ng ml−1) was added for 24 h. For the STAT3 inhibitor auranofin (Enzo Life Sciences), primary OPCs were cultured in OPC proliferation medium with 2 μM auranofin for 24 h, followed with IFNγ (100 ng ml−1) treatment for 24 h.

Specific gene sequences were used for qPCR, and the primer sequences used are as shown in Supplementary Table 10. Relative gene expression was calculated using the \({2}^{-\varDelta \varDelta \,{C}_{{\rm{t}}}}\) method, normalizing to the housekeeping gene Gapdh. A two-tailed paired t-test was performed using GraphPad Prism version 9.0.0 for comparing the relative expression levels.

For flow cytometry, OPCs were collected and washed with staining buffer (PBS/0.5% BSA). The cells were then stained using a LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain kit (for 633- or 635-nm excitation, Invitrogen) to determine cell viability, followed by staining of PD-L1-APC-conjugated antibody (1:100; BioLegend, 124312, clone 10F.9G2) for 30 min at 4 °C and washing once with staining buffer. Cellular fluorescence was measured with CantoII (BD Biosciences). Forward- and side-scatter parameters were used for the exclusion of doublets. Data were analyzed with FlowJo software 10.8.1 (TreeStar).

In total, seven batches were collected from the sequencing facility. Fastq files from 28 samples were processed throughout the 10x Genomics standard pipeline. Gene expression and chromatin accessibility libraries were inputted into cellranger-arc2 (ref. 75) ‘count' v2.0.2 with default settings to align the biological readouts on the associated mm10 reference genome v2020-A-2.0.0. Sample aggregation of both transcriptomic and genomics metrics was done using the ‘aggr' of the same CellRanger executable file, without normalization.

The aggregated count matrix and fragments file were loaded into R v4.3.2 (https://www.R-project.org). The former was lodged into a Seurat v5.0.3 (ref. 76) assay, whereas the latter was accommodated into a Signac v1.13.0 (ref. 77) chromatin assay associated with Ensembl78 base annotation v79_2.99.0 for mice where University of California, Santa Cruz, nomenclature was applied to provide gene name readability.

If not specifically mentioned, the following pipeline descriptions belong to either the Seurat or Signac package.

Cell-free mRNA contamination was removed from each droplet using Cellbender v0.3.0 (ref. 79). Genes called in all samples by Cellbender were included into the feature list. Potential cells called in both CellRanger and Cellbender were included in the cell list. In total, 181,674 cells were retrieved. Most of the genes affected by the ambient RNA removal were canonical genes and ribosomal genes (120 genes with a log2 (FC) greater than 1).

After determining that each cell could be uniquely identified, quality metrics for both gene expression and peak accessibility were calculated. Among others, the mitochondrial ratio, cell cycle score, nucleosome signal and TSS enrichment were generated to support the quality control cutoffs.

Minimum and maximum outliers in counts, detected genes, TSS enrichment and percentage of mitochondrial information were removed from the analysis (Supplementary Methods).

The aggregated fragments file was used in MACS2 v3.0.0 (ref. 80) to proceed to a peak call. Peaks falling in nonstandard chromosomes or overlapping genomic blacklist regions from the mm10 genome were discarded. The fraction of reads in peaks was then calculated for each cell, and the mean value for each sample ranged from 0.64 to 0.79.

The annotation of each peak was performed using the Ensembl base annotation v79_2.99.0 for mice, following the 10x Genomics guideline (https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger-arc/latest/analysis/peak-annotations), and saved in the same format as cellranger-arc output. In total, 976,949 entries were registered, with 20,611 promoter, 939,715 distal (10% inside the gene body) and 16,623 intergenic hits.

To consider a peak associated with a given gene, the function LinkPeaks from Signac was used with a P value cutoff at 0.05. The P values were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg method, and only associations with a P value adjusted lower than 0.01 were selected for downstream analysis. Peak coaccessibility was performed using Cicero v1.3.9, and P values were calculated on z scores of coaccessibility scores, adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg method and selected if less than 0.01 (Supplementary Methods).

The computation of fragment counts per cell in the gene body and promoter region (gene activity) was performed with the GeneActivity function from Signac, fetching all biotypes and extending 500 bp upstream of the TSS to catch the promoter region. All other parameters were set to default. This matrix was used later to infer chromatin accessibility for each gene.

The detection of putative events where more than one cell in the same droplet occurs was performed using DoubletFinder v2.0.4 (ref. 81).

Most of the samples drew less than 1% of doublets, but eight samples drew 1.49, 1.59, 1.88, 2.35, 3.33, 5.08, 7.85 and 20.86% of doublets. Using the multiplet rate provided by 10x Genomics (https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001378811-What-is-the-maximum-number-of-cells-that-can-be-profiled), we were able to measure a 0.8%/8% theoretical number of doublets. Predicted doublets were removed from the downstream analysis (Supplementary Methods).

In total, 69,152 cells were sequenced with a priori sex annotation. This knowledge was used to create a machine-learning sex classifier to investigate sex-dependent transcriptomic or epigenetic differences. Equal numbers of cells for each sex (30,940 cells) were extracted from the main object to a sex object to build the model. Mouse genes and positions from chromosomes X and Y were extracted from Ensembl v79_2.99.0 (ref. 78).

The validation on the testing dataset yielded an accuracy of 95.4%, a sensitivity of 91.0% and a specificity of 99.7%. An insignificant number of male cells was annotated as female cells, while a few female cells were assigned as male cells. We then used the newly created model to process each cell of the main object. Correction of misassigned cells (8.32%) from a priori sex-annotated samples was performed (Supplementary Methods).

Some studies have reported that immune responses are different in many aspects between males and females in both MS and its animal models82,83. Because most of our samples were mixed with one male mouse and one female mouse, we created a sex prediction model based on the expression of sex-related genes (Methods). This sex prediction model was validated with samples containing cells from only male or female mice with EAE, with an accuracy of 95.3% on the validation dataset. There was better prediction accuracy in the male sample (99.48%) than in the female sample (86.13%; Extended Data Fig. 9b,c). We applied this sex prediction model to the entire dataset, annotated the sex of the cells (Extended Data Fig. 9d,e) and compared the differences between male and female OLG based on the sex prediction results. For OLG subpopulations, apart from sex-related genes, such as X inactive specific transcript (Xist and Tsix), ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat containing Y-linked (Uty), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 3 structural gene Y-linked (Eif2s3y), dead-box helicase 3 Y-linked (Ddx3y) and lysine demethylase 5D (Kdm5d), no other genes were found to be differentially expressed between males and females (Extended Data Fig. 9f). Accordingly, we found no major differences between the OLG of males and females at the gene expression level in our data. We also did not observe a significant difference in the percentages of imOLG between male and female mice (Extended Data Fig. 9f–h). Thus, our data indicate that OLG responses to the neuroinflammatory environment in EAE are not characterized by sexual dimorphism.

Each feature of each cell of the gene count matrix was divided by the total counts of that cell and multiplied by a scale factor of 10,000. The obtained scaled matrix was then natural-log-transformed. The peak count matrix was processed through a term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) normalization, which computed a log (TF × IDF) with a scale factor of 10,000. Each feature of each cell of the gene activity matrix was divided by the total counts of that cell and multiplied by a scale factor of 10,000. The obtained scaled matrix was then natural-log transformed.

To proceed to the reduction of the dataset dimensions, the 2,000 most variable genes were selected via variance stabilizing transformation, and 95% of the most common peaks were also selected. The expression of each gene was transformed by subtracting its average expression and scaled by dividing its standard deviation.

Reduction of the dimensionality of the expression matrix on the 2,000 most variable genes was done by running a principal component (PC) analysis. The first 30 PCs, representing most of the diversity of the dataset, were selected by the elbow plot method. The partial singular value decomposition was used to reduce the dimensions of the most common peaks, and 12 of the first latent semantic indexing (LSI) layers were selected via the elbow method. However, the first LSI was removed from the selected dimensions due to its high correlation with chromatin capture depth, which would bias the investigation of the chromatin opening binarity.

For both PCs and LSI, the graphs were made with the ‘annoy' method with Euclidean distances and 50 trees. A ‘k' for the k-nearest neighbor algorithm was set to 20. For the construction of the graph based on PCs, an acceptable Jaccard index was set to 0. For the multimodal nearest neighbor graph, the same numbers of PCs and LSIs were used. A ‘k' for the k-nearest neighbor algorithm was set to 20, 200 approximate neighbors were computed, and the cutoff to discard the edge in the shared nearest neighbor graph was set to 0.

Unsupervised clustering of the nearest neighbor graphs was performed using the Louvain algorithm. The resolution of each clustering was assessed using the ‘clustree' R package iterating over different resolutions to pinpoint the most stable clustering resolution. Resolutions of 1, 0.4 and 1.2 were selected, generating 19, 13 and 24 clusters, for gene expression, peak accessibility and joined modality, respectively. Of note, an undetermined cluster specific at 97.86% for a unique sample at the early time point was standing out of all other clusters. All 1,973 cells from this cluster were therefore removed from the downstream analysis.

In all visualizations of the cells, despite the high dimensionality of the data, the nearest neighbor graphs were reduced to only two dimensions using UMAP with the appropriate number of PCs and LSIs (‘Dimension reduction'), and other values were set as default.

As sample libraries were not prepared on the same day and sequenced in the same sequencing run, and technical artifacts might arise and generate variability not related to biology in the dataset. However, accounting for such disequilibrium, without removing the subtle differences between time points, was challenging. Batch effect correction methods such as Harmony84 or Scanorama85 with soft parameters completely masked the differences between time points. Moreover, sample integration with ‘cca' and ‘rpca' was also overcorrecting time-point-specific cell populations. Although the popular batch effect methods were not suitable for our particular dataset, we relied on the strength that every sequencing run possessed at least one CFA-Ctrl sample (except on late time point and Naive-Ctrl samples). Thus, we investigated if the cells in each CFA-Ctrl cluster were well mixed across the different replicates. All 14 major CFA-Ctrl clusters contained cells from all replicates. To analyze further at the cell mixing level, a local inverse Simpson's index (LISI) from Harmony v1.2.0, accounting for categorical variable diversity, was calculated for an equivalent number of cells in each CFA-Ctrl replicate, using the first two components of the joint projected UMAP. This score, initially ranging from 1 to the number of replicates, was normalized to a scale of 0 to 1. For CFA-Ctrl, 63% of the cells maintained a LISI of at least 0.5. The same strategy was applied to the Naive-Ctrl samples, where 15 of the 17 major Naive-Ctrl clusters mainly contained cells ascending from the two replicates; one homogeneous cluster was coming from a microglia cluster and the other one was from a pericyte population. At the single-cell level, 76% of the cells maintained a LISI of at least 0.5. For all EAE time points, the same method was applied, yet the calculated LISI was lower than CFA-Ctrl or Naive-Ctrl (EAE score equal to 0), probably due to the heterogeneity of the EAE score at the sample collection within each time point (46% for early, 51% for peak and 49% for late). Although this method does not allow us to mitigate potential hidden batch effects, it provides a well-balanced cell distribution at a consistent EAE score.

After removing cells with less than 200 detected genes, more than 8,000 detected genes and less than 10% of reads matching the mitochondrial genome using a dataset from the literature4, the transcriptomes of the remaining cells were normalized and scaled using SCTransform from Seurat. A label transfer was then performed from the literature annotation to the present dataset based on the transcriptional profile of selected anchors via the FindTransferAnchors function using canonical correlation analysis, the ten first dimensions of the PC analysis and recomputing of the residual with the reference SCT model parameters. The label prediction was run using TransferData with the previously determined anchors set and the canonical correlation analysis reduction to weight the anchors. For each cell, the highest prediction score was selected to make the annotation.

Cell-type annotation was assessed per cluster on the joined graph clustering resolution, and label transfer outputs, cell-type marker gene expression and chromatin accessibility were taken into consideration. More refined cell types for the MOL population were later considered.

Exhaustive lists of immune-related genes published in Meijer et al.13, specific to ‘immune response' (GO:0002250) and ‘immune system process' (GO:0002376), were used to evaluate the immune capability of each cell. Cells from Naive-Ctrl animals were used as the background signal. After removing unexpressed genes in our dataset, subcategories with genes related to positive regulation of immune response, negative regulation of immune response, antigen processing and presentation, positive regulation of type I/II IFN-mediated signaling pathway, positive regulation of cytokine production, complement activation, CD4+ T cell-related immune response and CD8+ T cell-related immune response were extracted from the immune gene list, respectively, using the MGI immune database (https://www.informatics.jax.org/vocab/gene_ontology).

For each cell type, immune scores were calculated for each immune subcategory and as a whole, using the AddModuleScore function from Seurat with default parameters. All scores were scaled from 0 to 1, and the probability of each cell following the immune score distribution of the Naive-Ctrl population was processed using the following distribution function, where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the immune score distribution of the Naive-Ctrl population, respectively:

Under the null hypothesis that each cell follows the immune score distribution of Naive-Ctrl cells in a given population, each cell with a P value less than 0.05, rejecting the null hypothesis, was classified as ‘immune'. Cells accepting the alternative hypothesis (P value greater than 0.05), sharing a relationship between the immune score of a given cell and the immune score distribution of the Naive-Ctrl population, were classified as ‘nonimmune'. Due to the lack of cells annotated as neurons in Naive-Ctrl samples, this population was not annotated. The same approach was used on the gene activity matrix to compare transcriptional and epigenetic immune states. An investigation of cell status was also performed using damage-associated gene lists8 (95 genes) following the same strategy (Supplementary Table 9).

To acknowledge the impact of CFA and pertussis toxin in CFA-Ctrl compared to Naive-Ctrl animals, we first performed a Pearson correlation on the gene expression matrix in each cell type between replicates of each time point. We found a high similarity of expression between OLs from CFA-Ctrl time points (Pearson correlation score between CFA-Ctrl replicates: 0.97–0.99; Extended Data Fig. 9i) and Naive-Ctrl replicates (Pearson correlation score between Naive-Ctrl replicates: 0.96–0.99). For OPCs, microglia and astrocytes, the correlation scores were slightly lower (OPCs, CFA-Ctrl replicates: 0.45–0.96, Naive-Ctrl replicates 0.85–0.98; microglia, CFA-Ctrl replicates: 0.69–0.92, Naive-Ctrl replicates: 0.80–0.92; astrocytes, CFA-Ctrl replicates: 0.84–0.99, Naive-Ctrl replicates 0.85–0.95). We did not compare the difference between CFA-Ctrl replicates in neurons, ependymal cells and pericytes due to low cell numbers. Because the cells we used for sequencing were sorted based on GFP signal, these microglia are likely to be activated microglia that engulf OLs and are therefore more sensitive to ex vivo alteration. The finding that microglia are more sensitive than other CNS cell types has also been confirmed before in another study86. We did not compare the difference between CFA-Ctrl replicates in neurons, ependymal cells and pericytes due to low cell numbers.

A gene expression matrix with CFA-Ctrl and Naive-Ctrl replicates was loaded into a SingleCellExperiment v1.24.0 (ref. 87) object where genes with less than ten counts were removed. Feature counts were then aggregated across cell types and broken down by sample. Each cell type was processed independently, and samples formed by less than 5 cells and time points formed by less than 30 cells were not considered for downstream investigation. The resulting matrix and associated metadata were loaded into an R object using DESeq2 v1.42.1 (ref. 88), with a design formula including sample names in addition to the debris removal method as a covariate. After size factors and dispersion estimations, results tables were extracted per contrast of Naive-Ctrl on CFA-Ctrl. Genes presenting an absolute log2 (FC) over 1 with an adjusted P value less than 0.01 and a baseMean (the average of the normalized count values, dividing by size factors, taken over all samples) greater than 1 were selected as differentially expressed. Seven genes passed the filters in MOLs (Adamts1, Gli2, Lypd6, Map7d2, Npr1, Rnf125 and Sema3c; Extended Data Fig. 9j), and one gene was differentially expressed in microglia between CFA-Ctrl and Naive-Ctrl samples (Csmd3).

All cells belonging to the OL lineage were subsetted for fine-tuning annotation. One EAE early time point sample collected on day 8 after immunization with a score of 0 (without any symptom but with weight loss during the disease course) was removed from the analysis due to no EAE symptoms and similar gene expression as CFA-Ctrl. As no major gene expression differences were found between Naive-Ctrl and CFA-Ctrl in the OL lineage population, Naive-Ctrl samples were removed from the downstream analysis. The processing of this OL lineage subset of 120,183 cells was similar to the processing of all cell types. Nevertheless, a few differences must be mentioned, specifically, the first 20 PCs and the first 9 LSIs were selected for graph construction. Additionally, cluster resolutions of 2.2, 0.8 and 3.6 were selected for gene expression, peak accessibility and joined modality, respectively. An in-depth label transfer was performed on the subset with the same methods as previously described using only the OL lineage cells from the literature dataset4 (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). From the 47 potential OL lineage cell clusters on joined graph clustering resolution, we aggregated them using the average hierarchical clustering methods (Supplementary Methods). The OPC cluster was subdivided into three subclusters as we observed two time point-specific groups of OPCs and a third group expressing cycling genes. Each aggregated cluster was manually assigned to the main OL lineage cell types (OPC, COP, MOL1, MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6) using specific gene markers and label transfers. OL lineage cell type subclustering (α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι and κ) was assessed and ordered along their average immune score for each main OL lineage cell type (Extended Data Fig. 4a). For instance, compared to other MOL2 populations, MOL2-ε, predominantly derived from the peak stage of EAE (Fig. 3c), exhibited an enrichment of immune-related genes, including IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (Ifit3), Nlrc5 and IFNγ-induced GTPase (Igtp), among others (Supplementary Table 2). MOL2-α, which mainly came from CFA-Ctrl and EAE at the early stage, expressed higher lipid metabolic process genes, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 1 (Hmgcs1), cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member 1 (Cyp27a1) and squalene epoxidase (Sqle; Supplementary Table 2). Oligodendrocytic myelin paranodal and inner loop protein (Opalin), which is associated with OL differentiation, was enriched in MOL5/MOL6-β. A major increase in the expression of actin cytoskeleton organization-related genes, such as actin binding LIM protein family member 2 (Ablim2), NCK-associated protein 5 (Nckap5) and prickle planar cell polarity protein 1 (Prickle1), was observed in MOL5/MOL6-ζ compared to other MOL5/MOL6 populations (Supplementary Table 2). The majority of MOL2-β and MOL2-γ were derived from late-stage EAE (Fig. 3b,c), with gene markers associated with metabolism and differentiation, like ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 6 (Enpp6) and S100 calcium binding protein B (S100b; Supplementary Table 2). In addition, most MOL5/MOL6-α, MOL5/MOL6-β and MOL5/MOL6-γ cells were mainly composed of cells from early-stage CFA-Ctrl and EAE samples, MOL5/MOL6-θ were mainly composed of cells from peak-stage EAE and cells from MOL5/MOL6-ζ and MOL5/MOL6-ι were drawn by late-stage EAE (Fig. 3b,c).

Transcriptomic and epigenomic variations in specific cell types throughout the disease time course were assessed in a pseudobulk manner. This technique allows us to overcome the sparsity of the datasets and highlight dynamic features within three modalities, gene expression, gene/promoter accessibility and peak accessibility. These tri-omics modalities meet the prerequisites for analyses based on the negative binomial distribution (lack of intrasample variability, most of the features remain stable throughout the tested conditions, raw integer counts to specific genomic locations, sufficient number of replicates). Each modality was loaded into a SingleCellExperiment v1.24.0 (ref. 87) object where features with less than ten counts were removed. Feature counts were then aggregated across cell types and broken down by sample. Each cell type was processed independently, and samples formed by less than 5 cells and time points formed by less than 30 cells were not considered for the downstream investigation. The resulting matrix and associated metadata were loaded into an R object using DESeq2 v1.42.1 (ref. 88), with a design formula including sample names in addition to the debris removal method as a covariate. After size factors and dispersion estimations, a Wald test was performed followed by a multiple testing correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. The results tables were then extracted per contrast. We decided to investigate four contrasts (early/control, peak/early, late/early and peak/late), depicting a broad overview of the disease time course. Features presenting an absolute log2 (FC) greater than 1 with an adjusted P value of less than 0.01 and a baseMean (the average of the normalized count values, dividing by size factors, taken over all samples) of greater than 1 were selected to be displayed on the heat maps and GO analyses for the modalities represented by gene and promoter and were included into the transcription factor analysis for the modality represented by peaks. Differential gene expression analysis between males and females within each time point was performed similarly, merging gene counts by both sample and sex.

Expression dynamics were assessed using velocyto v0.17.17 (ref. 29) to retrieve the number of spliced and unspliced reads in each sample. In addition to the CellRanger output directory, the GTF annotation file used by CellRanger was given, along with a GTF annotation file for mm10 repetitive elements from RepeatMasker (https://www.repeatmasker.org). Resulting loom files were loaded into scVelo89 in Python and directly imported via MultiVelo v0.1.3. After merging the samples, OL lineage cells were selected to undergo a log-transformed normalization on the 1,000 most variable features with at least ten read counts.

The chromatin accessibility matrix from Macs2 output was loaded, and peaks were aggregated around each gene using peak annotation (‘Peak annotation') and feature linkage prediction (‘Peak annotation') inputted in the aggregate_peaks_10x function. OL lineage cells were selected to undergo a TF-IDF normalization.

The 120,183 cells as well as the 798 genes with both expression and chromatin accessibility signals were picked to compute moments for velocity estimation for each cell across its 30 nearest neighbors calculated from Euclidean distances in the first 30 PC spaces of the expression matrix. Weighted nearest neighbor properties calculated previously on the OL lineage cells were used to smooth the epigenetic modality and were incorporated into RNA velocity to recover chromatin dynamics and carry out enhanced lineage predictions. This last step was done on MOL5/MOL6 and MOL2 populations separately. For each cell type, a new UMAP was generated; velocity, latent time and terminal states were processed; and CFA-Ctrl cells were set as root cells.

MultiVelo classifies, if possible, each gene into two modules of biological dynamics. This tool is anchored in two models for the correlation of gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes within the latent time line: a first model (M1) where chromatin starts closing before the end of transcription and a second model (M2) where chromatin starts closing after the end of transcription. Moreover, the coupled kinetics of the transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles can be used as leverage to predict a current cell state for a given gene. The priming state is considered when the chromatin is opening but no unspliced transcript has yet been detected (brown, chromatin is opening but transcription is not initiated). The couple-on state is selected when the chromatin is open and the number of unspliced transcripts is increasing (pink, chromatin is open and transcription is initiated). The decoupling state is picked when there is a decorrelation between chromatin and unspliced transcripts dynamics. For the first model, the chromatin closes before the end of transcription, whereas for the second model, the number of unspliced transcripts starts decreasing but the chromatin is still open (dark blue, M1: chromatin accessibility starts closing before the end of transcription, M2: chromatin is open but transcription repression begins). The couple-off state is set when the chromatin is closed while the number of unspliced transcripts is collapsing (light blue, chromatin is closed and the number of unspliced reads is dropping; Fig. 7a and Extended Data Fig. 7a,b).

Due to the limited number of OPCs, some genes of interest did not present a complete transcriptional trajectory using MultiVelo. Therefore, we focused on key metrics to highlight their partial kinetics, including unspliced RNA, spliced RNA and chromatin accessibility levels of the same group of immune-related genes as in MOLs. We observed that spliced RNA levels of these immune-related genes were elevated in OPCs both at peak and in a subset of early-stage cells and were accessible at all time points. By contrast, unspliced RNA levels of these genes remained low across time points (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). Thus, based on OPC unspliced and spliced dynamics, OPCs may have a faster RNA splicing process than MOLs to meet their immune functional demands at early and peak stages of the disease.

The intermodality investigation helped us associate detected peaks with the expression of the most probable nearby genes using the LinkPeaks function from Signac, inspired by the method described in the SHARE-seq paper12. Each peak-to-gene connection, occurring in at least ten cells and within a 50,000-bp distance from the gene TSS, with a positive Pearson correlation coefficient and a P value lower than 0.05 was considered a meaningful interaction. For each cell, the number of fragments falling into the 47,610 peaks involved in the same number of meaningful interactions was divided by the total number of fragments falling in peaks for the same cell. From the normalized matrix of meaningful peaks per cell, the normalized numbers of fragments in peaks were aggregated by gene using the peak-to-gene connections, for a total of 14,665 genes joined to at least one peak. The regulatory chromatin score for each cell of the generated genes was then multiplied by a scaling factor of 10,000. Notwithstanding the value of such enhancer scores, we were interested in deciphering more consequent DORCs. Therefore, we selected a pool of genes connected to at least five peaks to redo the peaks-to-genes connectivity calculation on a broader distance of 500,000 bp from the gene TSS. Keeping a positive Pearson correlation coefficient and a P value lower than 0.05, a total of 66,105 peaks were connected to a total of 3,369 genes defined as DORCs. Similar to the regulatory chromatin of genes, the DORCs were normalized, aggregated per gene according to the new connection material and scaled to generate a DORC score.

As calculating the sum of the peak counts conserves the negative binomial distribution of the epigenetic modality, both regulatory chromatin and DORC-regulated genes were reversed into unnormalized matrices (scaling factor and number of fragments in peaks for a given cell) to be loaded into a SingleCellExperiment object to ascertain, with confidence, gene variations between time points in a pseudobulk manner as described above, with the same parameters and thresholds.

GRNs were inferred with Pando 1.0.0 (ref. 31). Pando models the relationship between transcription factors and their binding sites in selected regulatory regions with the expression of target genes combining multiome RNA and ATAC information.

The whole dataset was subset in MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6. For each MOL, we randomly subset a maximum of 2,000 cells per time point. We selected peak regions specific to each time point in MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6 (‘Multimodality features selection') as candidate regulatory regions to scan for transcription factor binding motifs with JASPAR (2022 release).

The GRNs were inferred by fitting generalized linear models (GLMs) implemented in Pando for the expression of each gene. The regression model with peak–transcription factor pairs as independent variables and target genes as response variables was built for MOL2 and MOL5/MOL6 populations independently. Peaks were assigned to nearby genes with the peak_to_gene_method = ‘Signac', which considers the closest distance, upstream or downstream, to the gene. The model estimates of each predicted transcription factor with a target gene can be interpreted as a measure of interaction between both. We calculated transcription factor activity by multiplying the mean estimates (coefficient) in the model by the average transcription factor expression at each time point. Transcription factor activities were ranked per the highest positive activity in each time point. Gene modules were selected with an R2 threshold of an adjusted P value lower than 0.05 and default parameters with the Pando find_modules function.

A total of two replicates per condition were sequenced for both bulk RNA-seq and bulk ATAC-seq. Raw FastQ files were aligned and processed using the NextFlow core ATAC and RNA pipelines90, nextflow v24.04.2, to the genome assembly GRCm38.

For bulk RNA-seq, gene-level integer raw counts tables from nf-core Salmon output were loaded into R and used as input for edgeR v4.2.0 (refs. 91,92) together with their associated metadata. The combined counts table was used to estimate the library size, perform CalcNormFactors with the trimmed mean of M values (TMM) method and perform the fit of genewise common dispersion (glmFit), followed by a likelihood ratio test (glmLRT). Benjamini and Hochberg's algorithm test was used to control the FDR.

First, differential gene expression was tested for changes in the first dose of IFNγ treatment versus control. Second, the resulting genes with a P value of <0.05 and FDR of <0.05 were tested for differential gene expression changes after the second IFNγ treatment dose. The experiment design included batch (replicates) and treatment as covariates. Visualization of the expression levels of differentially expressed genes was performed after running VST normalization from DESeq2 v1.44.0 in the whole dataset, including all replicates from the five time points. The final visualization shows the scaled z scores through the whole table, (scale function center = TRUE) for visualization purposes.

Aligned reads for treatment and replicates were extracted from processed BAM files from the nf-core ATAC-seq pipeline. Using BedTools v2.25.0 (ref. 93) coverage on the defined TSS windows and enhancer regions as a reference, an integer count table was built for enhancer regions and TSS windows, respectively, with defined regions as rows and samples as columns. Raw count tables on defined regions were loaded into R and used as input for edgeR v4.2.0, together with their associated metadata. Count tables were used to estimate the library size, perform CalcNormFactors with the TMM method and perform the fit of regionwise common dispersion (glmFit), followed by a likelihood ratio test (glmLRT). Differential accessibility testing was performed with the design (~0 + treatment, replicate) with makecontrast IFNγ 24 h (+0 h) – IFNγ 24 h (+96 h). Benjamini and Hochberg's algorithm test was used to control the FDR. TSS windows and enhancer regions were selected based on a ⎸ log (FC) ⎸ of <0.5 and FDR of >0.05.

To define the TSS windows, also referred to as promoter regions, all annotated TSSs from EnsEmbl Mouse genes version 102 were extracted. Each TSS was extended 25 bp upstream and 25 bp downstream. The resulting resized TSS regions were merged whenever there were overlaps between them using BedTools 2.17.0 mergeBed –s –nms. The resulting merged TSS regions were resized, adding upstream 500 bp and downstream 500 bp from the center. To avoid repeated regions, each window was annotated with the closest gene as a consensus. Windows including more than one TSS usually referred to alternative TSSs of the same gene. One gene can have several TSS windows assigned. The final annotations consisted of 113,018 nonoverlapping TSS windows of 1 kb in length.

To define enhancer regions, the regions defined as proximal and distal enhancers from ENCODE candidate cis-regulatory element (cCRE; GRCm38/mm10) assemblies and last updated 26 May 2021 were retrieved. Enhancer cCREs overlapping the defined TSS windows (‘IFNγ treatment, bulk RNA-seq and bulk ATAC-seq processing') were filtered out using BedTools v2.25.0 intersect –v. Resulting enhancer cCREs were merged in nonoverlapping regions with bedtools 2.17.0 mergeBed –s –nms and extended 500 bp upstream and downstream from the center. To avoid regions without evidence from our primary OPC bulk ATAC-seq analysis, any defined region not overlapping the consensus peaks from all conditions called by nf-ATACseq were discarded. To annotate enhancers to potentially regulated genes, each enhancer region was assigned to a candidate gene based on the previously calculated peaktogene interactions, CICERO, in our single-cell multiome data from OLG. The final annotations consisted of 59,857 nonoverlapping enhancer regions of 1 kb in length. One enhancer region can have several annotated cCREs and be assigned to different genes.

Visualization of ATAC signal on the TSS windows and the enhancer regions of the assigned genes was performed after running VST normalization from DESeq2 1.44.0 in the whole dataset, including all replicates from the five time points. Normalized counts were scaled from 0 to 1 by row (gene) for visualization purposes94,95,96

Samples with less than 5 cells and time points with less than 30 cells were removed before heat map generation. For gene expression and gene/promoter accessibility, normalized log transform aggregated gene expression and gene/promoter accessibility at each time point and cell type were calculated to generate heat maps scaled across time points from 0 (low) to 1 (high). For gene regulatory chromatin, the average value of the gene regulatory chromatin score at each time point and cell type was scaled across time points from 0 (low) to 1 (high). Missing values in any tested modalities were set to 0. The black column on the right side of each heat map represents the gene average raw count. For each modality, the average of the previously calculated scaled values per gene category and time point was used to produce the summarized dynamic line plots and their associated standard deviation of the distribution shown as a band of the same color.

Highlights of biological pathways involving the most dynamic features along the disease time course were assessed using the biomaRt v2.58.2 R package in addition to the Ensembl v79_2.99.0 database. For each cell type, the top 50 features with the highest amplitude across time points were selected. Genes possessing an Entrez Gene ID underwent pathway enrichment via the ‘enrichPathway' function from the ReactomePA v1.46.0 R package, with a pvalueCutoff set at 0.05, a qvalueCutoff set to 0.05 and FDR (‘fdr') as a method of adjustment. A maximum of ten pathways (adjusted P value of <0.05) ranked by adjusted P value were displayed on dot plots. Network graphs were built on significant pathways (adjusted P value of <0.05) from the ‘emapplot' function, taking as input the results of the pairwise_termsim function, with the Jaccard similarity coefficient as the calculation method for a maximum of 50 pathways ranked by adjusted P value.

Coverage of the DNA fragments within a given genomic region was determined using CoveragePlot from Signac. Tracks were normalized by group using a scaling factor as the number of cells within the group multiplied by the sequencing depth average of the group.

All fragments from 50 randomly selected cells per cluster and falling into a specific genomic region were carried into a 250-bp windowed matrix that was further down-binarized and plotted.

The number of cells per cell subtype in each condition was aggregated, normalized across conditions to get a proportion of each cell subtype per condition and divided by the number of conditions to keep the sum of the proportion equal to 100%.

The number of predicted male and female cells in each sex-specific sample was aggregated and normalized across samples to get a proportion of each sex per sample.

Distribution of cell numbers in the top levels of the circos plots, matched to each corresponding bottom level. For an unbiased visualization of proportion, some circos plots were randomly downsampled by top levels, bottom levels or both (details are mentioned in the figure legends).

The mouse genome was segmented into 100-bp windows, and fragments were assigned to their corresponding window, generating a binarized genome per cell matrix. For each group of cells, the fragment counts matrix was aggregated, multiplied by a scaling factor of 10,000 and divided by the number of fragments in the group.

Data were processed inside notebooks within a singularity environment (‘Code availability') on a high-performance computer cluster running under Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. One EAE early time point sample with a score of 0 was removed from the analysis due to no EAE symptoms and similar gene expression as CFA-Ctrl, as well as a MOL cluster specific at 97.86% for a unique sample at the early time point. Differential gene expression was determined using the DESeq2 package using negative binomial GLMs, which is the expected distribution from single-cell experiments97,98. Animals of both sexes were randomly assigned to experimental groups using the GraphPad randomization tool. The number of cells in each sample was selected to fit the specifications outlined by 10x Genomics. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

In case OpenAI's structure couldn't get any weirder—a nonprofit in charge of a for-profit that's become a public benefit corporation—it now has two CEOs. There's Sam Altman, chief executive of the whole company, who manages research and compute. And as of this summer, there's Fidji Simo, the former CEO of Instacart, who manages everything else.

Simo hasn't been seen much at OpenAI's San Francisco office since she began as CEO of Applications in August. But her presence is felt at every level of the company—not least because she's heading up ChatGPT and basically every function that might make OpenAI money. Simo is dealing with a relapse of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) that makes her prone to fainting if she stands for long periods of time. So for now, she's working from home in Los Angeles, and she's on Slack. A lot.

“Being present from 8 am to midnight every day, responding within five minutes, people feel like I'm there and that they can reach me immediately, that I jump on the phone within five minutes,” she tells me. Employees confirm that this is true. OpenAI's famously Slack-driven culture can be overwhelming for new hires. But not, apparently, for Simo. Employees say she is often seen popping into channels and threads, sharing thoughts and asking questions.

Simo joined during a chaotic period for OpenAI, which is expanding in nearly every direction. There are sovereign AI partnerships, new model releases, retail partnerships, multibillion-dollar compute deals, a proprietary chip, a mysterious hardware product—and of course, ChatGPT. “We do not battle for scope,” Simo says. “We battle for less scope.”

Outside Silicon Valley, Simo's hiring came as a surprise. For those in the know, it was less of a shock. A native of Sète, a small fishing town in the south of France, Simo made a name for herself running the Facebook app at Meta before taking the top job at Instacart in 2021. She took the grocery startup public two years later. In the Valley, she's known as a product visionary with a reputation for scaling consumer apps across the globe.

Simo's role at OpenAI is, in large part, to do the same—turn the company's research breakthroughs into moneymaking, must-have consumer products. She faces staggering competition from tech giants like Google and Meta, as well as AI startups founded by OpenAI alums, including Thinking Machines Lab, Anthropic, and Periodic Labs. “The thing that keeps me up at night is that the intelligence of our models is well ahead of how much people are using them,” Simo says. “I see my job as closing this gap.”

Since she arrived, Simo has overseen the launch of Pulse, a product that connects to users' calendars and gives them personalized information based on their schedule, chat history, and feedback; created a jobs platform to allow people to get AI-certified and look for roles that make use of their skills; and doubled down on improving ChatGPT's responses to people having acute mental health crises. Eventually, sources say, she'll be the person deciding how to roll out ads in ChatGPT's free tier.

We're sitting in the light-filled modern farmhouse where Simo lives with her husband, Rémy, and their 10-year-old daughter. On the table in front of us sit a pile of pastries and a box of Rémy's chocolates. A former engineer, he now makes desserts full-time.

It's an idyllic backdrop for the person helming what might be the most ambitious startup on earth. If OpenAI's mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity, Simo's goal is to build and scale the tools that make that possible. The question for her—and for OpenAI—is whether the mission can survive the business model. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Zoë Schiffer: You're the CEO of Applications—and you report to Sam Altman. What has that working relationship been like?

Fidji Simo: What Sam wanted was the ability to focus on research and compute, so I am trying to make sure that he can free up his time. Meanwhile, he realized that this is a company that evolved primarily from a research lab but became a really important product company, and that requires a different muscle. I see my role as making that product company incredibly successful while respecting the culture of the research lab.

When you're coming into a job like that, is someone checking your references?

[Laughs.] I think Sam had gotten references on me for like three years. Sam and I worked in the same circle, so he knew about my reputation. I don't think he literally picked up the phone and was like, “Is she legit?”

I was going to ask if Mark Zuckerberg was one of yours …

Mark has been an incredible supporter throughout my career and has provided references many times. In this particular situation, I don't think Sam called him.

You've talked about how at Meta you took risks and at times put your role and reputation on the line. I'm curious if you've identified any risks that you want to push OpenAI to take.

Well, taking the job felt pretty risky to me [Laughs]. I would say the thing that I don't think we did well at Meta is actually anticipating the risks that our products would create in society.

At OpenAI, these risks are very real. Mental health and jobs were my first two initiatives when I came into the company. I was looking at the landscape and being like, “Yep, immediately, mental health is something that we need to address. Jobs are clearly going to face some disruption, and we have a role to play to help minimize that disruption.”

That's not going to be easy, because the path is uncharted. So it is a very big responsibility, but it's one that I feel like we have both the culture and the prioritization to really address up-front.

How do you feel the company is doing on mental health right now?

Just in the span of the last few months, we have massively reduced the prevalence of negative mental health responses. We have launched parental controls with leading protections. And we are working on age prediction to protect teens.

At the same time, when you have 800 million people [per week], when we know the prevalence of mental health illnesses in our society, of course you are going to have people turn to ChatGPT during acute distress moments. And doing the right thing every single time is exceptionally hard. So what we're trying to do is catch as much as we can of the behaviors that are not ideal and then constantly refine our models.

But if you were to grade where the company is now and where you want it to be, what would you say?

It's not as if we're ever going to reach that point where we're done. Every week new behaviors emerge with features that we launch where we're like, “Oh, that's another safety challenge to address.” A good example is mania. You look at the transcripts, and sometimes people say, “I feel super great. I haven't slept in two days, and I feel on top of the world.” A clinical psychologist would understand that that's not normal—that's mania. But if you look at the words, it seems fine. So we work with psychologists to detect the signal that this isn't someone being super excited, this is a sign of mania, and have a strategy to intervene.

Getting it wrong is also really annoying. If you're a normal adult being excited and ChatGPT tells you, “Hey, you might be having a manic episode,” that's not great. It is a very subtle area, and we're trying to do it with as much care and as much external input as possible.

OpenAI is obviously one of the world's most valuable startups, if not the most valuable, but it's also losing billions of dollars every year.

I've noticed.

What opportunities do you see to get it on a path to profitability?

It all comes back to the size of the markets and the value we're providing in each market. In the past, only the wealthy had access to a team of helpers. With ChatGPT we could give everyone that team—a personal shopper, a travel agent, a financial adviser, a health coach. That is incredibly valuable, and we have barely scratched the surface. If we build that, I assume that people are going to want to pay a lot of money for that, and that revenue is going to come.

Meanwhile, on the enterprise side, we sell an API and ChatGPT Enterprise, which is a great product but a very thin layer compared to all the things that we could be building for enterprise. If you think about building agents for every industry and function, there is so much to build, either by us or by enabling third parties to build on top of our platform.

So I'm like, OK, the markets are huge. The depth of value is huge. That's the basic formula for monetizing. Then the real question becomes, will we have the compute to deliver that?

OpenAI has been doing hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of deals to build data centers. When people talk about fears around the compute deals, they're talking not only about the scale but about the deals feeling a little circular. Or the fact that a lot of the US economy seems to hinge on OpenAI and Nvidia at this point.

So first off, a lot of people say, “Whoa, these compute deals are massive,” but when you look at how constrained we are internally and how much more we could do if we had more GPUs, it's very clearly the right decision. We have a pipeline of products that are going to make massive use of compute. I know these deals look risky on the outside, but on the inside, what's much riskier would be to not lean into compute.

The companies that we're making these deals with are extremely sophisticated. They are providing these kinds of deals and this kind of financing because they are very close partners who know our business very well.

You take a product like Pulse, which we launched through the Pro tier. I want that to be available to everyone, but because of the compute constraints, we're not able to do that. I'm giving you one example, but there's 10 of those.

How do you use Pulse?

It's super helpful for me on both the work front and the health front. On health, Pulse tells me every morning if there's new studies published about anything related to my condition. Previously I had to research all of that. And instead of going to a medical journal, it's all summarized in line and very clearly laid out.

For work, it's similar. As you know, staying on top of AI news is a challenge. Having Pulse deliver a quick summary of what happened in the AI world is super helpful. My husband is a chocolate maker, and he's building an advent calendar. Pulse was like, ‘Oh, you should hide a message in all of the different windows.' He was like, ‘That's brilliant!'

You're a very successful person, and you also have a chronic illness. I'm curious what you've learned from managing these two things simultaneously?

It's a good question. I didn't want my disease to get in the way of my mission. If you are able to give your all to a job, you can come up with a lot of accommodations that make it possible. I recognize that I'm incredibly lucky to have worked at supportive companies, and that's not the case for everyone. Because people never see someone senior with a chronic illness be public about it, a lot of people assume that that's just not possible. And when I became public about it, I had a lot of people reach out and be like, “Oh my God, I realize there is a path.”

It's not easy every day, just to be clear. I would much prefer to be able to do all the things. But it's a matter of determination and prioritization. In a way, it has also made me more aware of product opportunities that I wouldn't have been able to see before. My passion for health has allowed me to narrow in on things that we can do to help with health care.

You got sick when you were at Meta, right? After a pretty difficult pregnancy.

Yeah. I was on bed rest for five months. I had to have surgery during the pregnancy to avoid [the baby] coming out early. I started having contractions at month four. So I was at a real risk of losing her. I worked the entire time through my pregnancy. In fact, my husband just showed pictures from my 40th birthday of me holding a Zuck review from my bed. It wasn't cool at the time to work from home. And I was presenting on Facebook Live. I worked through it, and I ended up on the other side of that with POTS. Then I had surgery for endometriosis in 2019, which made the POTS even worse. So since 2019, I haven't come out of it, basically. I've just had ups and downs. But 2019 is really when it started being very, very triggered.

You asked what I've learned from this. It's funny because you'd think I'd have thought about that, but so few journalists go there that I haven't actually answered that question much.

I care a lot as part of my own mission about everybody realizing their full potential. I want a world where health conditions don't get in the way. Either because we can cure them or because companies accommodate them. We can have technologies that make it easier.

I think if I had gotten sick a lot earlier and we didn't have norms to be on Zoom, that would've been a lot harder. I really feel for all the people who have so much to offer the world, but these things get in the way.

Constraints also force you to be more creative. I think these very hard physical constraints have forced me to be very intentional about how I lead.

OpenAI has a famously in-person culture. How do you create trust with a team when you can't always see them face-to-face?

The thing that really helped is that I was very up-front. On day one, I sent a message to everyone explaining in detail my condition, because there is a real challenge with invisible illnesses. You'd look at me and think I'm fine. And so explaining very transparently like, “Hey, I would really love to be in the office right now more than anything, and there are some days where I'm going to be able to do that, and there are some days where I have to work reclined.” I think that actually created a lot of trust. It created vulnerability up front, and that's not easy. It's risky when you arrive in a place to have to say that. I agonized about it for a couple weeks.

The thing that I try to do very well is be very present in other ways. It's an in-person culture, but it's also a very Slack-driven culture. I think I'm more accessible than I could be if I was running around in the office. I certainly hope that this relapse ends so that I can be in the office a lot more, but I think [my strategy] has helped so far.

I have heard from a lot of people that your Slack game is very strong.

[Laughs.] If journalists know about that, I don't know if that's good.

Part of your mandate is figuring out how ads would work inside ChatGPT. How might that look, and what's your timeline?

Advertising as a model works really well when you have a lot of commerce intent. We have a ton of it already, people coming and asking for shopping advice. The important thing before we ever consider ads is making sure that our commerce experience is fantastic and that people come and really explore all the products that they want and get great recommendations.

So you're not at the point where if someone asks for shopping advice, they might get recommended a paid product?

No.

OpenAI has rich user data. It combines peoples' work life, their most personal thoughts, their habits and product needs. That information is extremely attractive to advertisers. How are you thinking about data privacy as you scale?

Whatever we do is going to have to be extremely respectful of that. That's why we haven't announced anything on ads, because if we ever were to do anything, it would have to be a very different model than what has been done before.

What I've learned from building ad platforms is that the thing people don't like about ads very often is not the ads themselves, it's the use of the data behind the ads.

You were prepared for the ads question.

I have been asked that many times now.

It seems like OpenAI is expanding in a lot of different directions at once. Do you see a risk in the company trying to do too much?

My role is to minimize that risk. And the way you solve that is simple. You attract the best talent, so instead of one person being across 15 projects, you have the best leader for every single project. I'm very focused on hiring and making sure that we have the best possible talent.

We believe that every category of software is going to be reinvented for AI, and that we have a role to play in making sure that all of the products that we use in the future are AI-­enabled, AI-native from the ground up. So it does require having that level of ambition and the capabilities to fulfill that ambition, which is really my job in building out the company.

Sora, OpenAI's video app, launched with a pretty minimal slate of safety features and guardrails. What was the thinking behind that approach?

I actually think it launched with a pretty good set of safety features. We rolled out parental controls that let parents control how their kid's likeness can be used. They can control what hours their kid uses the app. The control that I can have over my likeness is advanced and thoughtful I think, even for adults.

At the same time it's a completely new form of interaction. So we are learning and refining based on the feedback.

I was thinking about the copyright cases, where it felt like you were more reactive.

What we're hearing from copyright holders is that there is actually a lot of excitement about this new media and how their IP could go in the hands of fans in a way that increases fan engagement. But they want to make sure that the value exchange is well established. And we want that too.

The app got criticized as being, essentially, AI slop.

I think every new form of media goes through phases. First, it's an imitation of what exists. If you look at cinema for example, it started by being just a recording of people on stage before close-ups or different shots were introduced. Here I think we're in the same world where AI is trying to copy human output, and potentially in places with a worse version. What I'm interested in is when it moves to the next stage of true experimentation with what's unique about the medium, and we're starting to see that emerge. Sometimes I go through videos and I'm like, “OK, it's more of the same,” and then all of a sudden I stop and I'm like, “Who made that?”

I worry a little bit about paternalism around the narrative of slop. For some people, some of this content is really entertaining. I have a friend who has a small business, and the business plan that she gets from ChatGPT, yeah, it's not Goldman Sachs, but she will never get access to Goldman Sachs. And what she gets from ChatGPT is 10X better than anything she has ever had access to. We need to be looking at this new medium as raising the floor of what could be created before and giving minimum access to people who didn't have access before.

There's a lot of worry about AI disrupting jobs. How concerning is that for you?

I believe that there's going to be massive job creation, but some job categories are going to be deeply disrupted. That's why one of my first initiatives was launching OpenAI certifications, where we want to certify 10 million workers to be AI-ready, and a jobs marketplace to connect them with opportunities to apply those skills. We're doing our part, but I think governments and companies are going to have a big role as well.

As AI continues to advance, what do you think of as humans' edge?

Humanity is endlessly creative. AI gives us superpowers to be even more creative. So this notion that humans will just tap out, like, “Oh, we're done,” doesn't resonate with me at all.

I'm leaning into this with my daughter. We're all born creators, but we sometimes forget that as adults. I see her going from idea to creation faster than I could. She's created three businesses and she's 10. She's written a song, she's written a book, because it's just so easy.

So your daughter can use ChatGPT?

Oh, she definitely does. It's not supposed to be for under 13, but under parental supervision, I let her use ChatGPT.

There's a fear circulating that AI is going to wipe out humanity. Do you share that?

I wasn't educated in that fear before I began digging into OpenAI. That said, we are doing everything we can to make sure that that doesn't happen.

Would you ever consider becoming CEO of the whole company?

Let's be very clear: What Sam does, I cannot do. There's so much to do just on my scope that I think I have a decade or more of things that I can do just right there. And I'm telling you, we need all of us. We need Sam so badly. We need me.

Small gadgets and handy techy gizmos work great as stocking stuffers or secret Santa gifts for friends, family, or coworkers. In fact, we've collected them in our comprehensive list of the Best 40 Techy Gifts under $100—that should give you plenty to parse through.

But this list is not that. These are the big tech products from 2025 that really got us amped up. They're more expensive than what you'd buy for an acquaintance, but if you're looking for a big reaction on Christmas morning from your kids, spouse, or significant other, one of these should do the trick.

Easy prediction: The Switch 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is going to be the best-selling piece of tech this holiday season. The system only came out in June, and plenty of people have likely been saving up for a holiday purchase. It's a no-brainer for families, especially if they didn't already own an original Switch. You likely already know what makes the Switch 2 so special, with its highly improved (and larger) screen over the original.

We aren't anticipating any major price cuts, but several bundles help save some cash, especially if you are already planning on purchasing a particular game. For example, the bundle with Super Mario Kart World saves you $30, which helps get around the expensive prices of the games. If your giftee already has a Switch 2, I recommend checking out our Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, all of which have been tested by us, which could also make for a great gift for Nintendo fans.

Perhaps more than any other coffee machine, the xBloom Studio Coffee Machine (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is made for tinkerers. It's an ambitious piece of tech that aims to recreate the perfect cup of pour-over coffee right in your home, all in one device. Coffee enthusiasts may scoff at the idea of automating a process that often takes such serious tweaking and precision, but according to our resident coffee expert and food tech reviewer, Matthew Korfhage, the xBloom Studio pulls it off.

Making coffee on the xBloom Studio doesn't simplify the process of pour-over, enabling its own level of nerding out via the comprehensive app. Every imaginable element of the process can be fine-tuned. The level of detail most definitely isn't for the faint of heart. It's also a sleek-looking appliance to have on your kitchen counter, though there are certainly cheaper coffee machines that still emphasize tech and style. But for the right person, the xBloom Studio Coffee Machine is a coffee nerd dream come true.

You know what they say: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The Logitech MX Master 3S had long been the most popular productivity mouse you could buy, so there were big expectations for its successor. Thankfully, the MX Master 4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) delivers without rocking the boat too much. There's now haptic support in the thumb rest, and you can press here to activate the virtual Actions Ring. You can customize the ring via the Logi Options+ app and have it launch apps, websites, insert symbols, or even text—the options are nearly endless.

It might not be worth an upgrade from the MX Master 3 or 3S, especially since the polling rate hasn't changed, but there's no question the MX Master 4 has taken the reins as the go-to wireless mouse for serious office workers. If there's someone in your life who you know would appreciate a mouse that not only provides great ergonomic support but also feels extremely high-quality in the hand, look no further.

When it comes to tablets, there's still nothing quite like the iPad. The latest model didn't change much, just adding the A16 chip to the mix. It's otherwise the same old iPad we all know and love. The big upgrade is in the software. With iPadOS 26, this basic iPad (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is going to feel a lot more like a capable laptop replacement. With full window support, you'll be able to handle windows and apps in the same way you would on a MacBook, resizing and multitasking to your heart's content. There are a lot of other improvements in the software, too, including a more Mac-like cursor and the introduction of the Preview app. It's a revolutionary change to the entire iPad lineup, but it feels truly transformative for this iPad because of its price.

There's a reason we call it the best iPad for most people. I would have never said this about the base iPad in the past, but if you or someone you know can make this work as their primary computing device, it might be the most affordable way to get some work or studying done.

Oakley

Oakley

Whatever you may think of Meta's AI and privacy policies (which are garbage), it's hard to argue that the best smart glasses are the ones people already wear. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses are basically the wildly popular Oakley Sphaera, just with workout headphones, a 5-mic array, and a 12-MP action camera with image stabilization built into the bridge of the nose. You can integrate the glasses with your Garmin and use the watch to trigger autocapture of your most fun moments, or you can just say, “Hey Meta, take a video” as you hike under a waterfall. The headphones sound great—they're the only open-ear headphones I haven't had to jack all the way up to hear at 20 mph on a bike—and the lenses are Oakleys, which means that they have cutting-edge color technology and are interchangeable for the seasons.

If you have a tech bestie or wife in your life who also likes biking, running, skiing, or snowboarding, you are in luck. I can't wait to take the Vanguards out snowboarding this year and finally film my friend on that sweet, sweet (tiny) jump, without dropping my phone in the snow.—Adrienne So

With all the earbuds we review, you might think our audio experts are above something as common as AirPods. But Apple really nailed it this year with the AirPods Pro 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). It has been almost three years since Apple updated its noise-canceling earbuds, and the latest come with a new ear tip design, support real-time translation, vastly improved noise canceling, and longer battery life. According to our testers, they last up to eight hours with noise canceling on, which means they can go for more than a full day of work. All that adds up to this pair being the best AirPods ever made.

In the past, selling overly light laptops usually meant tradeoffs and compromises. But not with the Asus Zenbook A14 (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Yes, it's incredibly light, to the point where you might forget it's in your backpack altogether. Not only does the Zenbook A14 weigh only 2.16 pounds, but it also doesn't skimp on the stuff that really matters, like performance, battery life, display quality, or even ports. After all, what good is a super-light laptop if it fails to meet your needs?

The Qualcomm Snapdragon X or X Plus chip is the key to the laptop's success in this regard, offering efficient performance that translates to hours and hours of battery life. (Just know that this is an ARM processor, meaning you may run into some compatibility issues with some apps and games.) You'll get the same fantastic OLED screen and long-lasting battery life regardless of which chip configuration you choose. It even comes with legacy ports like HDMI and USB-A, unlike so many laptops that are focused on portability.

The world of gaming handhelds has really expanded over the past few years, largely thanks to the success of both the Switch and the Steam Deck. But there has also been a plethora of Windows-based gaming handhelds to capitalize on the trend, allowing you to game anywhere with your Steam library. The ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X (7/10, WIRED Recommends) represent the pinnacle of how far this hardware has come. And yes, a big part of what helped give this product such a splash was the official Xbox branding, even though it very much feels like a true sequel to the original Asus ROG Ally. Will that Xbox name help Windows handhelds go mainstream? I'm not sure, but that seems to be the hope behind the partnership.

Either way, you get solid performance via the AMD Ryzen Z2 A (or great performance with Z2 Extreme on the Ally X) and surprisingly good battery life. No, the screens aren't super high-res—or even OLED—but the base ROG Xbox Ally is fairly affordable at $600, undercutting even the Lenovo Legion Go S.

It's been a long time since Apple has made an Apple Watch worth upgrading for. But that's really what the Apple Watch Series 11 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) accomplishes. So, what's the flashy new feature that makes this Apple Watch finally worth it? It's not the AI workout buddy, but the longer battery life. Our smartwatch reviewer and fitness editor extraordinaire, Adrienne So, says the battery life took a huge step forward.

That alone makes this worthwhile, but she also notes that the health updates in the Apple Watch Series 11 are clinically validated now, too, and the satellite messaging on the Watch Ultra 3 is particularly handy for intrepid outdoor adventurers. So, whether you opt for the standard version, the cheaper Apple Watch SE, or the advanced Apple Watch Series 11 Ultra, it's finally time to upgrade that old Apple Watch you've been hanging on to.

Is your spouse or parent still clinging to that 6-year-old iPhone, cracks and all? Honestly, that's smart. No one needs to upgrade their smartphone every year. But if your loved one's device is clearly showing its age, and more importantly, not receiving critical software updates anymore, it's time to consider a new phone. For iPhone owners, the natural upgrade is the iPhone 17 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). The best part about it is that Apple finally brought its ProMotion technology from the Pro models into this phone, meaning the screen refreshes at double the rate of the iPhone 16—it'll appear much smoother and snappier.

Battery life has improved, there's an upgraded front camera system that lets you capture selfies in any orientation without having to twist the phone in your hand, and the dual-camera system still delivers great results. It may not be the best iPhone for gamers—the iPhone 17 Pro's thermal management improvements and A19 Pro chip really shine there—but the iPhone 17 remains the best model to buy for most people. It comes in really fun colors, too.

We have a guide that breaks down the entire iPhone 17 range in case you want to consider other devices like the iPhone Air. —Julian Chokkattu

Is your loved one on the Android side? You have far more options to choose from, but I think they'd probably fall in love with the Google Pixel 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends)—especially in the gorgeous Indigo color. It includes an excellent triple-camera system that features a 5X optical zoom camera—very uncommon at this price bracket. This is also the first flagship Android phone with Qi2 support, meaning there are magnets embedded in the back of the phone, just like MagSafe on iPhones. This enables the ability to attach magnetic accessories, but also allows for faster and more precise wireless charging.

If your loved one appreciates a great gadget, they'll be ecstatic to see one of these framed deconstructed art pieces from Grid Studio. I've linked the Game Boy Advance here, but Grid has dozens and dozens of deconstructed devices, from the iPod and the Wii Remote to the BlackBerry Bold and even the original iPhone. The company says the parts are original, and some may even show wear and tear. The batteries are fake to prevent any hazards. There are labels describing several parts, and some specific prints have even more details. —Julian Chokkattu

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","When My Dog Chewed a Hole in My Duvet, I Discovered This Cool Textile Recycling Service","https://www.wired.com/story/trashie-recycling/","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 14:06:00 GMT","

We all have a favorite purchase that we'd love to last forever. Maybe it's a fuzzy blanket that nothing comes close to replicating, or a limited-edition, circa-2008 bedazzled iPod shuffle. As priceless as these things feel, they're not infallible. You've got about two to three years, give or take, before your beloved bed sheets and feather pillows are going to give up the ghost and need replacing. Electronics are also complicated to dispose of, given that batteries can't be thrown in the trash, yet you want to free up some storage space.

When their time is up, you must—in the most literal sense—lay them to rest. I take the mantra of “reuse, reduce, and recycle” very seriously, and will eke out as much extra mileage as I can by cutting up old sheets and towels to use as cleaning rags, or making a ratty old pillow into a makeshift dog bed. Recycling programs near me don't accept textiles, so eventually I have to toss them into the trash, knowing they're headed to a landfill.

The numbers on textile waste are astounding. In 2017, the UN Environment Programme reported that 92 million metric tons of textile waste were generated globally each year, with the US accounting for 17 million metric tons, according to another 2017 statistic by the Environmental Protection Agency.

It feels pretty bleak. However, thanks to a targeted social media ad, I found a textile-recycling subscription service that's the answer I've been looking for: Trashie. Purchase a “Take Back Bag” for $20 and you can send in clean, used clothing, bedsheets, shoes, and even old Halloween costumes. The bags come in packs of one or three. There is also the “Take Back Tech Box” for $25, where you can send back old electronics that have been collecting dust in a drawer. In return, you earn points for discounts or gift cards at major retailers like Cozy Earth and Nuuly. You can also shop and earn points at partner sites, like Parachute. So, if you've been looking for an excuse to get rid of last season's trends that not even the thrift store would want (goodbye, puffy quilted tote bag; I do not understand why this was a trend), this is it.

Dr. Andre West, director of The Zeis Extension (ZTE) at North Carolina State University's Wilson College of Textiles, corroborated the UN's and EPA's data in his research. And he says the problem of textile waste is only getting worse.

Fast fashion is to blame for a lot of this, he says. “In the USA, there would be a higher amount [of waste] than there has been in the past. I don't see it slowing down at this point in time.”

Furthermore, it's hard to track where textile waste ends up, and thus, calculating exact numbers like this can be quite the undertaking. ""It's also hard to determine [data], because waste goes into all different avenues—it doesn't go into one big lump. Some of it gets discarded, some of it gets burnt, some of it gets cubed and shipped to other countries,"" he says.

Dr. West painted a picture for me of how big a deal not only the process is, but how impactful a business like this could potentially be. “Sorting products is still in its infancy of how to do it properly,"" he says.. “Even if you sorted by color, they're all made from different materials with buttons, zippers, and linings.” He also told me that items can oftentimes be mislabeled. This affects recycling because breaking down each of these fibers requires a different, often time-consuming process, so having a service like Trashie handle this is a potential game-changer.

Into my Take Back Bag went a duvet cover that my dog chewed holes in and some old linens that were the material version of a Walking Dead zombie. You can also throw in clothing that isn't suitable for donation. Hate to tell you, but that stained sweater? No one's going crazy over that one at the thrift store, but it is perfect for Trashie's recycling purposes. Trashie accepts a pretty extensive list of recyclable items (assuming they're clean), which you can find here.

I also partook in the Take Back Tech Box, sending in up to 10 pounds of old charging cords and phones. If you're worried about personal information still on your devices, Trashie has a process to erase your data. More on that in a minute.

I sealed both the Take Back bag and the Tech Box (adhesive strips are attached), added some extra tape for good measure, and then scanned the QR code on the bottom right of the bag. Once you've signed up for an account, you'll be prompted to enter a numerical code printed below the QR code. From there, drop it off at your nearest UPS location and enjoy the points added to your Trashie account. Points give you access to more exclusive deals, called “Premium Deals.” You can also earn points by shopping partner deals on Trashie's “Deals” tab, where a bag or box purchase isn't required—look for a small, green “TC” logo on qualified deals. However, points are only accrued once you buy via the TC deal (Trashie redirects you to the site you're looking to gain points on). It takes much longer to earn a substantial number of points this way, and you're not recycling anything.

I reached out to Trashie's CEO and founder, Kristy Caylor, to learn more about Trashie and what she envisions for the future of textile recycling. Caylor comes from a fashion background, where she witnessed firsthand the water and textile waste the industry generates—particularly in the fast-fashion avenue.

Once shipped off, your bag is ultimately delivered to one of Trashie's recycling centers. “Our material recycling happens after the sorting process and through a network of certified partners primarily in the United States,” said Caylor. “These partners work according to the Global Recycled Standard. We prioritize working with partners that are geographically close to our domestic sorting operations to minimize shipping and reduce our carbon footprint.”

To touch on the sorting process, it's kind of like when you separate your paper, plastic, and glass recyclables. Take Back bags and Tech Boxes are sorted with precision to determine what is available to work with. If items still have some life left to give, they're donated to charity. The rest continues its way through Trashie's recycling process. As stated on Trashie's website, “Reusable items are redistributed through a network of global partners, ensuring they reach the right people at the right time.”

I asked Caylor about this, too, curious to see where these charity items wound up. Here's what she told me: “When items are designated for reuse, they're redistributed through our domestic and international network of retailers who have a specific need for those categories—everything is sorted by product type and condition to ensure the right match. This category-based approach maximizes reuse and significantly reduces what ends up in the trash. Some items flow through charitable channels across the US, where we supply seasonally relevant products to meet local needs.”

A more recent example of local needs can be seen with Trashie's outreach to those affected by the LA wildfires, working to apply not only the Trashie recycling process but get clothing resources to those in dire need. But this distribution isn't just to make an impact on communities both domestic and international—it's to keep these materials from ending up in landfills, which circles back to the founding mission of Trashie. Kind of like how recycling itself is a circular process.

Trashie handles both e-waste recycling and data purging domestically as a security measure. No outside parties are involved; handling in-house controls access to devices and data during this process. Old devices are cleared of your personal information and either refurbished or shredded to extract metal and plastic components.

If you're as curious as I am about what my duvet cover is going to be transformed into, I asked Caylor about that, too. “These products can be cut into materials and repurposed into products like pet bed filling, insulation, carpet padding, industrial rags, or even re-spun into new yarns,"" she said. ""For example, cotton sheets might be turned into the soft fill used in pet bedding.” Ironic how my dog Randy could prevail in this situation with a new bed, given that he destroyed the duvet.

So you want to cash in on your recycling efforts with these newfound points you've amassed. Once your Trashie account is all set up, there are two main categories of rewards: the “Premium” ones that you apply points to, or the ones I lovingly refer to as “the freebies.” You can peruse both these categories daily to see if any new brands have joined the roster. The free ones usually include coupon codes to apply at checkout, whereas the Premium offerings deduct points from your overall TrashieCash sum, often for an even better discount. Trashie also has a Chrome extension that helps tally up points and discounts when you shop via partner sites. Save the Earth, save some money—a double-whammy win-win.

As for the premium points, you get 30 points or “TrashieCash” with a single TakeBack Bag. Discounts will vary by vendor. Many options cost five TrashieCash points for an exclusive discount code, like a $20 discount at Cozy Earth for a purchase of $60 or more. In the case of Andie Swim, 20 points equals a $20 discount.

While you can't apply points to buying another Trashie TakeBack Bag directly from the site, here is a workaround: You can use them to purchase it on a partner site that offers them. If you don't want to buy bags individually, you can also sign up for a subscription to get a bag every month, three months, or six months. Opting for a subscription also gives you a 15 percent discount, bringing the total to $17 per bag.

You may have all sorts of streaming subscriptions, but a recycling service is an easy way to reduce your environmental impact while still getting benefits. As for me, I'm excited to get a replacement duvet cover with my points—looks like I'll be cashing in on that Cozy Earth deal after all.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Young People Are Tripping on Benadryl—and It's Always a Bad Time","https://www.wired.com/story/young-people-are-tripping-on-benadryl-and-its-always-a-bad-time/","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

There's a figure who may greet you during an intense Benadryl trip.

Faceless, shrouded in black with red eyes and a top hat, it ominously lurks in the corner. The Benadryl Hat Man is a shared and recurring hallucination that people report witnessing when taking dozens of the antihistamine at a time. The figure, depicted in Halloween costumes, POV-Benadryl trip memes, and Walmart graphic tees, has become the symbol for a new drug trend that sees young people deliberately taking large doses of the drug, not to ward off allergies, but to get high.

John, a 21-year-old college student who used to trip on Benadryl, never saw the Hat Man. Yet, he says, “I could see how that could happen. It's [Benadryl] digging in the depths of your brain to find whatever's making you scared. So, if you're scared of the Hat Man, I'm sure you're going to see the Hat Man.” This searching for the unpleasant to reveal itself, while sounding horrible, is, in fact, the purpose of recreational Benadryl use. (John does not want his real name used due to fear of friends finding out.)

When used in high doses, diphenhydramine, an ingredient in Benadryl, functions as a deliriant, a hallucinogenic class of drugs, which appear to be becoming increasingly popular among young people for nonmedical purposes. Unlike psychedelics or other hallucinogens, there's no real potential for a good trip on a deliriant. According to the people I spoke to, every trip is bad, every trip is brutal, and that's the point.

In 2020, the “Benadryl challenge” gained traction on TikTok, daring participants to take doses of at least 12 Benadryl pills for an intense trip. The trend, which resurfaces every few years, drew attention to the psychoactive effects of deliriants. “I saw a video about it on TikTok once, so I knew it could be used recreationally,” one user tells me.

With little to no harm reduction information readily available about high levels of consumption, problems began to rise. In May 2020, three Texas teens were treated for Benadryl overdoses in just a week, one of whom was just 14 years old and took 14 pills. The 14-year-old recovered and returned home the next day. In August 2020, a 15-year-old died from a seizure after overdosing on the drug in Oklahoma. In September 2020, the FDA issued a warning for parents to hide and lock up their Benadryl supply, warning of the potential risk of heart problems, seizures, and, less commonly, comas and even death. Despite the warning, the trend seems to have persisted. In 2020, there were 4,618 cases reported to US Poison Centers for Benadryl usage; that number climbed to 5,960 in 2023, according to a study published in Pediatrics Open Science in August. Benadryl and deliriants in general have embedded themselves as staples on the fringes of the American youth—a cheap and easy way to get fucked up. WIRED reached out to Benadryl manufacturer Kenvue for comment. A spokesperson for the company stated, “This behavior is extremely concerning and dangerous,” and encouraged consumers to “carefully read and follow the instructions on the label and contact their health care professional should they have questions.”

John started taking Benadryl recreationally in November 2024, when he was 20, after using it to sleep and then hearing about the potential to trip online. He was depressed at the time and would take 12 pills for a big trip, multiple times a day, with each trip lasting four to six hours. Instead of the Hat Man, John saw eyelash mites, small bugs that form in clusters at the base of your eyelashes, alongside “shadows that would dart across your peripheral.” The trips were also tactile; John would see and feel spiders all over his body, describing feeling a “foreboding tingling.”

The users I spoke to described a range of unpleasant symptoms including a dramatic increase in heart rate, nausea, breathlessness, dry mouth, and severe memory loss. That's just if the trip goes “well.” But the fun doesn't stop there. Ryan Marino, a toxicologist and assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University's School of Medicine, says, “Use of these central anticholinergics does cause amnesia (and impair memory formation) and so may certainly make people feel like they are developing dementia or having cognitive issues.” John felt his neurocognitive function decaying firsthand, having had to drop his college chemistry class when he was taking Benadryl.

Online deliriant communities on Discord and Reddit are filled with users posting trip reports and flexing their highest dosages, sometimes rising to 25 pills per trip.

For John, taking high doses of Benadryl was a form of self-harm and a way to “escape.” “You could be going through the worst thing ever, and it just doesn't matter,” he says, “because in the moment you're like, I'm seeing spiders, that's what matters. I'm so scared of the spiders.”

This escape is sometimes reached with brutal numbness, a complete dulling of the mind. Tom, a 27-year-old user from Europe, explains that once the novelty of the terrifying visuals wears off, users can become used to them, and then they feel nothing. “If someone is depressed and they do psychedelics, their feelings will become more intense, whereas deliriants do the opposite,” says Tom, who didn't want to use his real name for professional reasons. “They numb all the emotions.”

Deliriants are somewhat of a chemical mystery, Marino says. Drugs like LSD and psilocybin produce “psychedelic effects and particularly hallucinations through your serotonin system,” he explains. “Benadryl does not induce hallucinations that way.” What causes disturbing visions like the Hat Man, beyond a lack of mediation through serotonin, is unknown. “The direct reason for those visuals, I don't think, is understood really at all,” Marino says.

Benadryl, Marino says, “is not considered addictive in the technical sense. However, the associated behaviors or ways people use them could lead to addiction.” These associated behaviors refer back to the search for escape, Marino explains. “If they are being used to escape reality, people can find themselves using increasing doses or with increasing frequency.”

While Benadryl appears to be the most popular deliriant among youths, the plant datura is another popular one. “Datura is really interesting because the plant grows pretty ubiquitously in Europe and North America,” Marino explains. To trip, “people will consume the seeds, either making them into a tea or just eating them,” he says.

Tom, who's experienced with both, tells me there are almost no distinguishing qualities between the two trips. However, datura has a different “allure” because it was used by Indigenous people in America in rites-of-passage rituals and rain dance ceremonies. It was also used to practice ancient witchcraft in medieval Europe, with ointments applied to the skin that created hallucinations of flying.

“So it is more of a spiritual drug compared to Benadryl,” says Tom.

Part of the appeal of Benadryl is its accessibility and affordability. Some users refer to it as the “poverty drug” because of its low cost. “I can go down to my one corner store in my town and I can buy 100 capsules of Benadryl for, like, three bucks. You can't get beer for that,” John says. “It's not something you do if you have the means to do something else.”

In some ways, high-dose Benadryl consumption seems to be a confluence of subcultures and issues facing Gen Z in modern America. A drug trend popularized on TikTok, but fueled by the desire for escape in a generation plagued by mental health issues. Yet, faced with too great financial instability to even lurch to the escapes of old—like booze and cannabis—some just pop 15 Benadryl pills for a few bucks and meet the Hat Man.

After nearly a year of using and a couple of relapses, John is now sober from Benadryl.

He seems deeply regretful of his time with deliriants and thankful for the loved ones around him who helped kick the habit. Since quitting, he's had more time to focus on his hobbies of drawing and playing guitar, and continue his college degree. “I can't ever do that bullshit again,” he says.

“You have to be in a place where you can't get anything else, and you don't want to do anything else,” he says. “You have to be pretty far gone to be abusing Benadryl.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","AMD's $9.2B Juggernaut: Inside the Strategy Challenging Intel, Nvidia","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/amds-9-2b-juggernaut-inside-the-strategy-challenging-intel-nvidia-180016.html","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 13:01:33 GMT","

The air in New York at AMD's 2025 Analyst Day last Tuesday was electric — and being there on-site made it even clearer that the real story wasn't the record-breaking numbers. It was the palpable shift in the industry narrative.

While the tech world remains fixated on Nvidia's staggering valuation and Intel's ongoing turnaround saga, AMD, under the steady hand of CEO Lisa Su, has been quietly executing a multi-year masterclass in strategy.

The results speak for themselves: a record revenue of $9.2 billion, soaring 36% year-over-year (YOY) and obliterating consensus estimates. It wasn't just a good quarter; it was a dominant performance, with non-GAAP net income skyrocketing 152% sequentially to $2 billion.

AMD is no longer just the scrappy underdog; it's a quiet giant steadily outmaneuvering rivals by capitalizing on their core weaknesses, like Intel's market vulnerabilities and Nvidia's growing list of self-inflicted problems.

A fascinating undercurrent at the analyst event was the quiet chatter among attendees about customer frustration. There's a growing sentiment among IT customers that they feel “cheated” by major OEMs that continue to default to non-AMD solutions.

For years, Intel-based servers and Nvidia-based AI platforms were the “safe” choice. Now, IT managers are realizing they are paying a premium for solutions that are often less economically viable and, critically, not power-efficient enough.

Recent candid remarks from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella validated this sentiment. He stated that Microsoft's primary bottleneck to AI expansion is no longer a chip shortage, but rather a power shortage. Nadella revealed that Microsoft has a stockpile of advanced GPUs it cannot deploy because it lacks the data center “warm shells” with enough available electricity to plug them in.

This dynamic is where Nvidia's “performance at all costs” mantra hits a wall of physical reality. As I've argued before, Nvidia's proprietary reign invites disruption. If your most powerful GPUs are too power-hungry for your biggest customer to deploy, you have a massive market vulnerability. That reality has created a golden opening for a competitor focused on efficiency and real-world deployment, and AMD is walking right through it.

Nvidia's success has placed the company on a dizzying pedestal, but that height comes with its own kind of gravity. To keep supporting its massive valuation, Nvidia must constantly push its highest-margin, highest-hype products to the forefront. In that environment, it's easy for blind spots to form — and for the company's focus to drift away from what customers increasingly care about: cost and power.

AMD, by contrast, is essentially flying under the radar. Free from the burden of a $5 trillion market cap, its leadership can remain laser-focused on a long-term plan. This strategy, as outlined at the analyst day, is a multi-pronged assault: compute technology leadership, data center leadership, pervasive AI, open software platforms, and custom silicon.

This disciplined execution is a hallmark of AMD's leadership team, many of whom, including Lisa Su and CTO Mark Papermaster, share roots (as I do) at IBM. This IBM heritage runs deep — shaping a culture of engineering rigor, long-term planning, and a customer-centric focus on solving complex enterprise problems.

As a result, many companies are finding AMD a more reliable partner. They are perceived as collaborators, not dictators, who are willing to build custom silicon solutions rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all proprietary product down a customer's throat.

AMD's Q3 results show it is masterfully executing a pincer move, attacking both its rivals on their home turf.

On one front, AMD is systematically carving up Intel's heartland:

On the second front, AMD is outflanking Nvidia in the AI data center:

This growth is so robust that AMD delivered a record quarter despite an $800 million Q2 charge tied to U.S. export restrictions on its MI308 China-bound chip. That kind of performance reflects a business that is both resilient and diversified, not reliant on any single product or market.

AMD's leadership isn't resting on these results. The company is investing aggressively — $40 billion in organic R&D, much of it focused on AI, and another $60 billion earmarked for acquisitions. Together, these initiatives support an ambitious five-year plan to capture more than 50% of the server revenue market, over 40% of the client market, and more than 70% of the embedded market.

Hitting those milestones would put AMD on a path toward a projected 35% CAGR. At the center of that growth story is the Helios Rack, a full AI building block built around AMD's next-gen CPUs, GPUs, UALink, and AI NICs, all tuned for ROCm. Notably, partners — not AMD — will sell these systems, positioning them as a more open and efficient counterweight to Nvidia's vertically integrated stack.

The company's guidance for Q4 2025 projects revenue of approximately $9.6 billion with an even stronger non-GAAP gross margin of 54.5%. This forecast, which excludes any revenue from the restricted China chips, shows that AMD's growth is now fully self-sustaining.

AMD's Q3 2025 financial report is a powerful testament to the value of quiet execution over market hype. The company is perfectly poised to slipstream Nvidia in the AI race by offering a more efficient, open-source, and customer-friendly platform, all while simultaneously exploiting Intel's market weaknesses to capture record share in the client and server markets.

This dual-front war is succeeding, and the record-breaking $9.2 billion revenue — achieved despite significant geopolitical headwinds — proves AMD's strategy is not only working but accelerating.

While Nvidia grapples with the pressures of its own valuation and power-hungry hardware its customers can't even deploy, AMD is focused, disciplined, and clearly building the foundation to become the most trusted and versatile high-performance computing leader of the next decade.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Jeff Bezos is a startup CEO again. 

The Amazon founder is co-CEO of Project Prometheus, a new AI startup that has raised $6.2 billion in funding, according to The New York Times, making it one of the most well-funded early stage AI companies.

The move represents Bezos' return to an operational executive role for the first time since stepping down as CEO of Amazon in 2021. He is “founder” at Blue Origin, his Kent, Wash.-based space company, but the role at Project Prometheus reflects his desire to engage more directly. 

There are few public details about the company. Its LinkedIn page offers a simple description: “AI for the physical economy.” Bezos is also an investor in the company.

The startup already has about 100 employees and is targeting computers, automobiles, and aerospace, according to the Times. Its headquarters location is unknown.

Bezos will lead the company with fellow co-CEO and co-founder Vik Bajaj, a life sciences veteran who previously worked on research efforts at Alphabet's “moonshot” unit Google X. Bajaj is managing director at Foresite Capital Management and also co-founder and a director at Xaira Therapeutics, a biotech startup with offices in Seattle. 

Given Bezos' existing ties to Amazon (as founder and largest individual shareholder), there could be potential collaboration between the Seattle tech giant and Project Prometheus.

For example, Amazon could serve as a potential customer, R&D partner, or infrastructure provider for Prometheus's AI-for-engineering ambitions. The startup could also benefit from Amazon's existing logistics, robotics and operational systems experience.

During a recent fireside chat at Italian Tech Week 2025 in Turin, Bezos acknowledged signs of an AI “industrial bubble” — but also said the technology will bring massive benefits to society. 

“When the dust settles and you see who are the winners, society benefits from those inventions. … The benefits to society from AI are going to be gigantic,” he said. 



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

PowerLattice, a Vancouver, Wash.-based startup aiming to reduce energy demands of AI computing, emerged from stealth mode this week and announced a $25 million Series A round.

Playground Global and Celesta Capital led the round, which brings total funding to $31 million. 

AI chips are becoming so powerful that they're using huge amounts of electricity and generating massive heat inside data centers. Data center operators are running into limits on available power and cooling capacity. 

PowerLattice says its new component — a “power delivery chiplet” — can cut that energy use by more than half and boost chip performance by delivering power more efficiently, directly inside the processor package.

Early silicon is already complete, and the company is providing engineering samples for next-generation GPUs, CPUs and custom accelerators. PowerLattice said the technology can slot into existing chip products without major redesigns.

Founded in 2023, PowerLattice has about 20 employees and is actively sampling with a range of organizations, according to a spokesperson.

PowerLattice was founded by semiconductor veterans Peng Zou, Gang Ren and Sujith Dermal, with backgrounds spanning Qualcomm, Intel and NUVIA — a silicon startup acquired by Qualcomm in 2021. Board members include former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, now a general partner at Playground Global, and Celesta Capital's Steve Fu. 

Gelsinger spent more than three decades at Intel, more recently serving as CEO from 2021 to 2024. He previously led VMWare as CEO for more than eight years.

“AI is not constrained by capital, it's constrained by power,,” Gelsinger said in a statement. “PowerLattice represents a dramatic breakthrough in the efficiency and scale of power delivery.”

PowerLattice is headquartered in Vancouver, Wash., near Portland, with additional operations in Chandler, Ariz.

GeekWire previously reported on PowerLattice in May.

Can the software development hero conquer the “AI Slop Monster” to uncover the gleaming, fully functional robot buried beneath the coding chaos?

That was the storyline unfolding inside a darkened studio at Seattle Center last week, as Amazon's Kiro software development system was brought to life for a promotional video. 

Instead of product diagrams or keynote slides, a crew from Seattle's Packrat creative studio used action figures on a miniature set to create a stop-motion sequence. In this tiny dramatic scene, Kiro's ghost mascot played the role that the product aims to fill in real life — a stabilizing force that brings structure and clarity to AI-assisted software development.

No, this is not your typical Amazon Web Services product launch.

Kiro (pronounced KEE-ro) is Amazon's effort to rethink how developers use AI. It's an integrated development environment that attempts to tame the wild world of vibe coding, the increasingly popular technique that creates working apps and websites from natural language prompts.

But rather than simply generating code from prompts, Kiro breaks down requests into formal specifications, design documents, and task lists. This spec-driven development approach aims to solve a fundamental problem with vibe coding: AI can quickly generate prototypes, but without structure or documentation, that code becomes unmaintainable.

It's part of Amazon's push into AI-powered software development, expanding beyond its AWS Code Whisperer tool to compete more aggressively against rivals such as Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini Code Assist, and open-source AI coding assistants.

The market for AI-powered development tools is booming. Gartner expects AI code assistants to become ubiquitous, forecasting that 90% of enterprise software engineers will use them by 2028, up from less than 14% in early 2024. A July 2025 report from Market.us projects the AI code assistant market will grow from $5.5 billion in 2024 to $47.3 billion by 2034.

Amazon launched Kiro in preview in July, to a strong response. Positive early reviews were tempered by frustration from users unable to gain access. Capacity constraints have since been resolved, and Amazon says more than 250,000 developers used Kiro in the first three months.

The internet is “full of prototypes that were built with AI,” said Deepak Singh, Amazon's vice president of developer agents and experiences, in an interview last week. The problem, he explained, is that if a developer returns to that code two months later, or hands it to a teammate, “they have absolutely no idea what prompts led to that. It's gone.”

Kiro solves that problem by offering two distinct modes of working. In addition to “vibe mode,” where they can quickly prototype an idea, Kiro has a more structured “spec mode,” with formal specifications, design documents, and task lists that capture what the software is meant to do.

Now, the company is taking Kiro out of preview into general availability, rolling out new features and opening the tool more broadly to development teams and companies.

As a product of Amazon's cloud division, Kiro is unusual in that it's relevant well beyond the world of AWS. It works across languages, frameworks, and deployment environments. Developers can build in JavaScript, Python, Go, or other languages and run applications anywhere — on AWS, other cloud platforms, on-premises, or locally.

That flexibility and broader reach are key reasons Amazon gave Kiro a standalone brand rather than presenting it under the AWS or Amazon umbrella. 

It was a “very different and intentional approach,” said Julia White, AWS chief marketing officer, in an interview at the video shoot. The idea was to defy the assumptions that come with the AWS name, including the idea that Amazon's tools are built primarily for its own cloud.

White, a former Microsoft and SAP executive who joined AWS as chief marketing officer a year ago, has been working on the division's fundamental brand strategy and calls Kiro a “wonderful test bed for how far we can push it.” She said those lessons are starting to surface elsewhere across AWS as the organization looks to “get back to that core of our soul.”

With developers, White said, “you have to be incredibly authentic, you need to be interesting. You need to have a point of view, and you can never be boring.” That philosophy led to the fun, quirky, and irreverent approach behind Kiro's ghost mascot and independent branding. 

The marketing strategy for Kiro caused some internal hesitation, White recalled. People inside the company wondered whether they could really push things that far.

Her answer was emphatic: “Yep, yep, we can. Let's do it.”

Amazon's Kiro has caused a minor stir in Seattle media circles, where the KIRO radio and TV stations, pronounced like Cairo, have used the same four letters stretching back into the last century. People at the stations were not exactly thrilled by Amazon's naming choice. 

With its core audience of developers, however, the product has struck a nerve in a positive way. During the preview period, Kiro handled more than 300 million requests and processed trillions of tokens as developers explored its capabilities, according to stats provided by the company. 

Rackspace used Kiro to complete what they estimated as 52 weeks of software modernization in three weeks, according to Amazon executives. SmugMug and Flickr are among other companies espousing the virtues of Kiro's spec-driven development approach. Early users are posting in glowing terms about the efficiencies they're seeing from adopting the tool. 

Kiro uses a tiered pricing model based on monthly credits: a free plan with 50 credits, a Pro plan at $20 per user per month with 1,000 credits, a Pro+ plan at $40 with 2,000 credits, and a Power tier at $200 with 10,000 credits, each with pay-per-use overages. 

With the move to general availability, Amazon says teams can now manage Kiro centrally through AWS IAM Identity Center, and startups in most countries can apply for up to 100 free Pro+ seats for a year's worth of Kiro credits.

New features include property-based testing — a way to verify that generated code actually does what developers specified — and a new command-line interface in the terminal, the text-based workspace many programmers use to run and test their code. 

A new checkpointing system lets developers roll back changes or retrace an agent's steps when an idea goes sideways, serving as a practical safeguard for AI-assisted coding.

Amit Patel, director of software engineering for Kiro, said the team itself is deliberately small — a classic Amazon “two-pizza team.” 

And yes, they've been using Kiro to build Kiro, which has allowed them to move much faster. Patel pointed to a complex cross-platform notification feature that had been estimated to take four weeks of research and development. Using Kiro, one engineer prototyped it the next day and shipped the production-ready version in a day and a half.

Patel said this reflects the larger acceleration of software development in recent years. “The amount of change,” he said, “has been more than I've experienced in the last three decades.”

DoorDash disclosed a data breach that exposed the personal information of an unspecified number of users, which included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses.

Despite the fact that hackers stole phone numbers and physical addresses, DoorDash said that “no sensitive information was accessed by the unauthorized third party and we have no indication the data has been misused for fraud or identity theft at this time.”

DoorDash said in the post that the breach impacted a mix of customers, delivery workers, and merchants. The company did not respond to a request for comment, which included a question on exactly how many users were victims of the breach. 

The breach originated from an employee falling for a social engineering attack. When the company identified the breach, it shut down the hackers' access to its systems, started an investigation, and reported the incident to law enforcement, according to a post published last week by the company.

DoorDash said no “Social Security numbers, other government-issued identification numbers, driver's license information, or bank or payment card information” were stolen as part of the breach. 

The company said it has notified impacted users.

On Monday, a new Model Context Protocol security startup called Runlayer launched out of stealth with $11 million in seed funding from Khosla Ventures' Keith Rabois and Felicis. 

It was created by third-time founder Andrew Berman (previous companies: baby-monitor maker Nanit and an AI video conferencing tool, Vowel, that sold to Zapier in 2024).

In the four months since Runlayer launched its product in stealth, it has signed dozens of customers, including eight unicorns or public companies like Gusto, dbt Labs, Instacart, and Opendoor, it says. It also nabbed David Soria Parra, the lead creator of MCP, as an angel and advisor, Berman tells TechCrunch. (Parra did not respond to our request for comment.) 

Parra's team at Anthropic launched the protocol in November 2024 as an open source project. MCP has since become the de facto standard for allowing AI agents to connect with the data and systems they need to work independently. It allows agents to access data, move it, alter it, and execute business processes without human oversight. 

The protocol is now supported by every major model maker including OpenAI, Microsoft, AWS, and Google, as well as thousands of tech and enterprise companies; just to name a few: Atlassian, Asana, Stripe, Block, and others ranging from banks to consumer goods manufacturers. 

“Everyone talks about AI,” Berman, Runlayer's CEO, told TechCrunch, “but AI is really only as useful as the tools and the resources it has access to.”

The problem is, the MCP protocol itself doesn't include much security out of the box, so many MCP implementations have already been found to be vulnerable in a variety of ways.

The poster children are probably GitHub and Asana. In May, researchers at Invariant Labs discovered a prompt injection vulnerability in MCP servers that allowed them to grab data from private GitHub repositories (ones that shouldn't have been accessible to the public). Asana discovered and fixed a vulnerability in its MCP server in June that could have exposed customer data. There have since been many more types of attacks found to work on common MCP server setups.  

As you might expect, such security issues have given rise to numerous MCP security products, including products from big-name companies like Cloudflare, Docker, and Wiz — as well as a host of startups tackling more specific products. 

The most common type of MCP security product these days is a gateway, essentially a security layer for identifying the agents and controlling their access to apps. 

Runlayer plans to stand out in this crowded market by being an all-in-one security tool that combines a gateway with features like threat detection that analyzes every MCP request; observability that watched all agentic activity across all MCP servers that IT has permitted; enterprise development where IT can build custom AI automations for enterprise users; and detailed permissions that work with existing identity providers like Okta and Entra. 

Like other competitors, such as open source Obot, Runlayer business users are presented with an Okta-like catalog of the pre-vetted MCP servers that their IT will allow agents to access. Runlayer matches the agents' app permissions to the human users' permissions. For instance, some people might have read-only access to financial systems, some write access (the ability to change the data). Others have no access at all.  

Berman believes Runlayer stands out from the crowd, not just with the breadth of the product, but because of the team's experience. He founded the startup because, after selling Vowel to Zapier, he became the director of Zapier's AI, and built one of the first MCP servers, working closely at the time with OpenAI and Anthropic, he said.  

“What are the problems that we saw with the protocol? One, it was the security risk because it was adopted so quickly,” he said. There were “blind spots” in areas like observability and audits, that make it risky for enterprises to roll out to users.

So in August, “we left our jobs. We signed up David Soria Parra, the creator of the spec, and in four months, we've signed up eight unicorns,” he said of himself and his co-founders from Zapier Tal Peretz and Vitor Balocco.

Other advisors and investors in the company, Berman says, include head of security at Cursor Travis McPeak, and founder of Neon Nikita Shamgunov.

Three years ago, Luminal co-founder Joe Fioti was working on chip design at Intel when he came to a realization. While he was working on making the best chips he could, the more important bottleneck was in software.

“You can make the best hardware on earth, but if it's hard for developers to use, they're just not going to use it,” he told me.

Now, he's started a company that focuses entirely on that problem. On Monday, Luminal announced $5.3 million in seed funding, in a round led by Felicis Ventures with angel investment from Paul Graham, Guillermo Rauch, and Ben Porterfield. 

Fioti's co-founders, Jake Stevens and Matthew Gunton, come from Apple and Amazon, respectively, and the company was part of Y Combinator's Summer 2025 batch.

Luminal's core business is simple: The company sells compute, just like neo-cloud companies like CoreWeave or Lambda Labs. But where those companies focus on GPUs, Luminal has focused on optimization techniques that let the company squeeze more compute out of the infrastructure it has. In particular, the company focuses on optimizing the compiler that sits between written code and the GPU hardware — the same developer systems that caused Fioti so many headaches in his previous job.

At the moment, the industry's leading compiler is Nvidia's CUDA system — an underrated element in the company's runaway success. But many elements of CUDA are open source, and Luminal is betting that, with many in the industry still scrambling for GPUs, there will be a lot of value to be gained in building out the rest of the stack.

It's part of a growing cohort of inference-optimization startups, which have grown more valuable as companies look for faster and cheaper ways to run their models. Inference providers like BaseTen and Together AI have long specialized in optimization, and smaller companies like Tensormesh and Clarifai are now popping up to focus on more specific technical tricks.

Luminal and other members of the cohort will face stiff competition from optimization teams at major labs, which have the benefit of optimizing for a single family of models. Working for clients, Luminal has to adapt to whatever model comes their way. But even with the risk of being out-gunned by the hyperscalers, Fioti says the market is growing fast enough that he's not worried.

“It is always going to be possible to spend six months hand tuning a model architecture on a given hardware, and you're probably going to beat any sorts of, any sort of compiler performance,” Fioti says. “But our big bet is that anything short of that, the all-purpose use case is still very economically valuable.”

A Russian telecom company that develops technology to allow phone and internet companies to conduct web surveillance and censorship was hacked, had its website defaced, and had data stolen from its servers, TechCrunch has learned.

Founded in Russia, Protei makes telecommunications systems for phone and internet providers across dozens of countries, including Bahrain, Italy, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Pakistan and much of central Africa. The company, now headquartered in Jordan, sells video conferencing technology and internet connectivity solutions, as well as surveillance equipment and web-filtering products, such as deep packet inspection systems.

It's not clear exactly when or how Protei was hacked, but a copy of the company's website saved on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine shows it was defaced on November 8. The website was restored soon after.

During the breach, the hacker obtained the contents of Protei's web server — around 182 gigabytes of files — including emails dating back years.

A copy of Protei's data was provided to DDoSecrets, a nonprofit transparency collective that indexes leaked datasets in the public interest, including data from law enforcement, government agencies, and companies involved in the surveillance industry.

Mohammad Jalal, the managing director of Protei's branch in Jordan, did not respond to a request for comment about the breach. 

The identity of the hacker is not known, nor their motivations, but the defaced website read: “another DPI/SORM provider bites the dust.” The message likely references the company's sales of deep packet inspection systems and other internet filtering technology for the Russian-developed lawful intercept system known as SORM.

SORM is the main lawful intercept system used across Russia as well as several other countries that use Russian technology. Phone and internet providers install SORM equipment on their networks, which allows their country's governments to obtain the contents of calls, text messages, and web browsing data of the networks' customers. 

Deep-packet inspection devices allow telecom companies to identify and filter web traffic depending on its source, such as a social media website or a specific messaging app, and selectively block access. These systems are used for surveillance and censorship in regions where freedom of speech and expression are limited.

The Citizen Lab reported in 2023 that Iranian telecoms giant Ariantel had consulted with Protei about technology for logging internet traffic and blocking access to certain websites. Documents seen and published by The Citizen Lab show that Protei touted its technology's ability to restrict or block access to websites for specific people or entire swathes of the population.

South Korea's major defense giants have amassed roughly $69 billion in order backlogs as of late 2024, according to media reports. Seoul is also accelerating investment in advanced weapons systems and expanding its defense ties, particularly with Europe. With the new EU–South Korea Security and Defence Partnership in 2024 and growing exports of vehicles and artillery, the country has become the second-largest arms supplier to European NATO members.

Yet despite that enormous industrial footprint, remarkably few startups have emerged to match or challenge the incumbents. The country's defense-tech startup scene is still nascent, exposing a wide gap between Korea's manufacturing strength and its early-stage innovation.

Bone AI, a new startup based in Seoul and Palo Alto, California, launched earlier this year with an ambitious plan to build a fully unified AI platform that ties together software, hardware, and manufacturing. 

The company develops next-generation autonomous air (UAVs), ground (UGVs) and marine (USVs) vehicles for defense and government clients, focusing largely on B2G contracts. While it ultimately aims to operate all three types of systems, Bone is starting with its defense-focused aerial drones, which are designed to streamline missions such as logistics support, wildfire detection and anti-drone defense.

The company, founded by DK Lee (who also co-founded MarqVision), has raised a $12 seed round led by Third Prime with participation from Kolon Group, a South Korean strategic investor that has expertise in developing advanced materials and manufacturing. Kolon is an ideal strategic partner for Bone, which operates across AI, robotics and next-generation manufacturing, Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.

The startup is already generating revenue, landing a seven-figure B2G contract and pulling in $3 million in its first year of operation, Lee noted. In addition, Bone has been selected as a winner in a South Korean government-backed end-to-end logistics program that will deploy UAVs and UGVs powered by its autonomy stack.

When asked how a company less than a year old is already securing contracts and generating revenue, Lee told TechCrunch that Bone acquired a South Korean drone company called D-Makers, and its intellectual property (IP) just six months after launch. Originally focused on AI models for robotics, Bone is now integrating its existing AI division with the newly acquired company, and more acquisitions are on the horizon, he added.

Lee personally committed more than 10% of the round, approximately $1.5 million, he told TechCrunch. “That was important to me because I wanted to show both investors and my team that I'm fully invested, financially and emotionally, in this mission,” he said.

Bone is Lee's second venture. His experience co-founding MarqVision gave him firsthand insight into building and scaling AI products worldwide, but it also convinced him that the next frontier of AI isn't just digital; it's physical.

“After leaving MarqVision, I basically started from zero – going to robotics conferences like IEEE ICRA, cold-emailing the engineers behind Google RT-1/RT-2, and even walking up to Jim Keller, CEO of tenstorrent, at a cafe just to introduce myself and grab a coffee later,” Lee said.

Bone AI shouldn't be pigeonholed as just a defense tech company, the founder continued. With broader ambitions, Lee frames it as a “physical AI” firm, bringing together advanced AI simulation, autonomy algorithms, embedded engineering, hardware design and large-scale manufacturing under one roof.

While preparing his second company, Lee observed that AI and hardware were advancing in silos.

“No one was building the connective tissue, the industrial backbone that allows intelligent machines to exist at scale. Even Nvidia, the most valuable AI company today, relies on a vast ecosystem of fabrication and manufacturing partners across Asia and Europe,” he told TechCrunch.

Lee points to South Korea's track record of building global hardware manufacturing powerhouses like Hyundai, Samsung and LG. “This is why we should see more drone and small-robotics companies emerging here, and why Korea is fully capable of supporting them,” the CEO said. “Our mission at Bone is to build the supply chain for Physical AI within South Korea, and then expand that capability to the U.S., Europe, and other allied countries.”

Anduril has become a household name in the U.S., boasting a valuation north of $30 billion, while in Europe, Helsing last raised funding at around $13 billion. Even in smaller markets like Israel, companies such as Kela Technologies have achieved similar recognition.

Asia has yet to see the same level of adoption, Michael Kim, general partner at Third Prime, told TechCrunch. “As economies around the world focus on reindustrialization, not just the U.S., Bone sits at the intersection of sovereign AI, multipolarity, and reindustrialization,” he said, highlighting both the company's mission and the problem it aims to solve.

South Korea has high-quality, cost-competitive hardware manufacturing across multiple sectors such as heavy industry, shipbuilding, cars and semiconductors.

“Many niche hardware players exist but haven't received Bay Area VC funding; Bone has a strong ‘buy versus build strategy' to acquire and integrate these assets, accelerating product maturity and commercial traction,” Kim said.

As U.S. giants like Google, OpenAI and Anthropic race to develop the large language models that underpin their AI products, startups such as Sakana AI, Mistral AI, DeepSeek and AI21 Labs are carving out their own niche with specialized models designed for specific regions, industries, or unique features.

In pursuit of that goal, Tokyo-based Sakana AI has closed a ¥20 billion (approximately $135 million) Series B funding round, which values the company at $2.65 billion post-money, up from a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion, CEO David Ha told TechCrunch.

Founded in 2023 by former Google researchers Llion Jones, Ren Ito and Ha, Sakana AI makes affordable generative AI models that work well with small datasets and are optimized for the Japanese language and culture.

The Series B round drew a mix of new and returning investors, combining Japan's financial heavyweights like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) with global venture players such as Khosla Ventures, Macquarie Capital, NEA, Lux Capital and In-Q-Tel (IQT).

“We plan to deploy the new capital for not only R&D, including [AI] model development, but also to expand our workforce for engineering, sales, and distribution teams in Japan,” Ha said. This year, Sakana has expanded its presence in Japan, teaming up with leading local enterprises, including Daiwa and MUFG, and developing AI solutions.

Ha, who previously led research at Stability AI and worked at Google and Goldman Sachs, also said Sakana plans to expand its enterprise business beyond finance into the industrial, manufacturing, and government sectors in 2026.

Looking ahead, the company is eyeing the defense, intelligence and manufacturing sectors. The two-year-old startup also said it will be “actively pursuing strategic investment, partnerships and M&A for long-term global growth.

Sakana says it sees strong global demand for sovereign AI solutions that reflect “national cultures and values.” The Japanese startup added that focusing its R&D efforts on AI products after LLMs are trained helps it efficiently build advanced models tailored to Japan, taking a path distinct from the large-scale AI model race.

This funding round comes roughly a year after the company's Series A round, in which it raised about ¥30 billion ($214 million) at a $1.5 billion valuation. Sakana had raised roughly $244 million in total as of March 2025, according to PitchBook, so this round would take that total to about $379 million.

It's low but, um, never zero.

MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here.

In mid-October, a mysterious object cracked the windshield of a packed Boeing 737 cruising at 36,000 feet above Utah, forcing the pilots into an emergency landing. The internet was suddenly buzzing with the prospect that the plane had been hit by a piece of space debris. We still don't know exactly what hit the plane—likely a remnant of a weather balloon—but it turns out the speculation online wasn't that far-fetched.

That's because while the risk of flights being hit by space junk is still small, it is, in fact, growing. 

About three pieces of old space equipment—used rockets and defunct satellites—fall into Earth's atmosphere every day, according to estimates by the European Space Agency. By the mid-2030s, there may be dozens. The increase is linked to the growth in the number of satellites in orbit. Currently, around 12,900 active satellites circle the planet. In a decade, there may be 100,000 of them, according to analyst estimates.

To minimize the risk of orbital collisions, operators guide old satellites to burn up in Earth's atmosphere. But the physics of that reentry process are not well understood, and we don't know how much material burns up and how much reaches the ground.

“The number of such landfall events is increasing,” says Richard Ocaya, a professor of physics at the University of Free State in South Africa and a coauthor of a recent paper on space debris risk. “We expect it may be increasing exponentially in the next few years.”

So far, space debris hasn't injured anybody—in the air or on the ground. But multiple close calls have been reported in recent years. In March last year, an 0.7-kilogram chunk of metal pierced the roof of a house in Florida. The object was later confirmed to be a remnant of a battery pallet tossed out from the International Space Station. When the strike occurred, the homeowner's 19-year-old son was resting in a next-door room.

And in February this year, a 1.5-meter-long fragment of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket crashed down near a warehouse outside Poland's fifth-largest city, Poznan. Another piece was found in a nearby forest. A month later, a 2.5-kilogram piece of a Starlink satellite dropped on a farm in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Other incidents have been reported in Australia and Africa. And many more may be going completely unnoticed. 

“If you were to find a bunch of burnt electronics in a forest somewhere, your first thought is not that it came from a spaceship,” says James Beck, the director of the UK-based space engineering research firm Belstead Research. He warns that we don't fully understand the risk of space debris strikes and that it might be much higher than satellite operators want us to believe. 

For example, SpaceX, the owner of the currently largest mega-constellation, Starlink, claims that its satellites are “designed for demise” and completely burn up when they spiral from orbit and fall through the atmosphere.

But Beck, who has performed multiple wind tunnel tests using satellite mock-ups to mimic atmospheric forces, says the results of such experiments raise doubts. Some satellite components are made of durable materials such as titanium and special alloy composites that don't melt even at the extremely high temperatures that arise during a hypersonic atmospheric descent. 

“We have done some work for some small-satellite manufacturers and basically, their major problem is that the tanks get down,” Beck says. “For larger satellites, around 800 kilos, we would expect maybe two or three objects to land.” 

It can be challenging to quantify how much of a danger space debris poses. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) told MIT Technology Review that “the rapid growth in satellite deployments presents a novel challenge” for aviation safety, one that “cannot be quantified with the same precision as more established hazards.” 

But the Federal Aviation Administration has calculated some preliminary numbers on the risk to flights: In a 2023 analysis, the agency estimated that by 2035, the risk that one plane per year will experience a disastrous space debris strike will be around 7 in 10,000. Such a collision would either destroy the aircraft immediately or lead to a rapid loss of air pressure, threatening the lives of all on board.

The casualty risk to humans on the ground will be much higher. Aaron Boley, an associate professor in astronomy and a space debris researcher at the University of British Columbia, Canada, says that if megaconstellation satellites “don't demise entirely,” the risk of a single human death or injury caused by a space debris strike on the ground could reach around 10% per year by 2035. That would mean a better than even chance that someone on Earth would be hit by space junk about every decade. In its report, the FAA put the chances even higher with similar assumptions, estimating that “one person on the planet would be expected to be injured or killed every two years.”

Experts are starting to think about how they might incorporate space debris into their air safety processes. The German space situational awareness company Okapi Orbits, for example, in cooperation with the German Aerospace Center and the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol), is exploring ways to adapt air traffic control systems so that pilots and air traffic controllers can receive timely and accurate alerts about space debris threats.

But predicting the path of space debris is challenging too. In recent years, advances in AI have helped improve predictions of space objects' trajectories in the vacuum of space, potentially reducing the risk of orbital collisions. But so far, these algorithms can't properly account for the effects of the gradually thickening atmosphere that space junk encounters during reentry. Radar and telescope observations can help, but the exact location of the impact becomes clear with only very short notice.

“Even with high-fidelity models, there's so many variables at play that having a very accurate reentry location is difficult,” says Njord Eggen, a data analyst at Okapi Orbits. Space debris goes around the planet every hour and a half when in low Earth orbit, he notes, “so even if you have uncertainties on the order of 10 minutes, that's going to have drastic consequences when it comes to the location where it could impact.”

For aviation companies, the problem is not just a potential strike, as catastrophic as that would be. To avoid accidents, authorities are likely to temporarily close the airspace in at-risk regions, which creates delays and costs money. Boley and his colleagues published a paper earlier this year estimating that busy aerospace regions such as northern Europe or the northeastern United States already have about a 26% yearly chance of experiencing at least one disruption due to the reentry of a major space debris item. By the time all planned constellations are fully deployed, aerospace closures due to space debris hazards may become nearly as common as those due to bad weather.

Because current reentry predictions are unreliable, many of these closures may end up being unnecessary.

For example, when a 21-metric-ton Chinese Long March mega-rocket was falling to Earth in 2022, predictions suggested its debris could scatter across Spain and parts of France. In the end, the rocket crashed into the Pacific Ocean. But the 30-minute closure of south European airspace delayed and diverted hundreds of flights. 

In the meantime, international regulators are urging satellite operators and launch providers to deorbit large satellites and rocket bodies in a controlled way, when possible, by carefully guiding them into remote parts of the ocean using residual fuel. 

The European Space Agency estimates that only about half the rocket bodies reentering the atmosphere do so in a controlled way. 

Moreover, around 2,300 old and no-longer-controllable rocket bodies still linger in orbit, slowly spiraling toward Earth with no mechanisms for operators to safely guide them into the ocean.

“There's enough material up there that even if we change our practices, we will still have all those rocket bodies eventually reenter,” Boley says. “Although the probability of space debris hitting an aircraft is small, the probability that the debris will spread and fall over busy airspace is not small. That's actually quite likely.” 

We're increasingly developing bonds with chatbots. While that's safe for some, it's dangerous for others.

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

There is growing appetite in Silicon Valley for the legally murky and morally frowned upon practice of embryo-editing.

This is how it would work: Companies would use existing gene-editing technology called Crispr to cut unwanted traits from the DNA of an embryo, sperm, or an egg.

Two startups in particular have made headlines within the past month for their work in the field. There's Preventive, a California-based startup backed by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and his husband. The startup has reportedly already identified a couple interested in using their services, but the company denies that claim.

Then there's the New York-based Manhattan Genomics, which was co-founded by a former recipient of tech investor and antichrist-lecturer Peter Thiel's fellowship that gives people money to drop out of college and start a business.

There's one small hiccup though. The practice, which has been the subject of newfound investor interest, is banned by law in the United States.

Not only would these startups be barred from editing embryos within the United States, they would also face federal restrictions on research and development attempting to perfect the technology. Privately, they can research whatever they want but, according to FDA policy, they can't spend any federal funds on embryo-editing research and can't obtain clinical approval to use an embryo that has been edited.

That doesn't leave much leeway for these companies, according to New York University professor of bioethics Arthur Caplan.

“It's very easy for the government to link private activities to government funding, because they'll say things like ‘Well, you used a DNA sequencer, and that was built with NIH money, so you can't use that,'” Caplan told Gizmodo.

But, of course, there are loopholes. These companies could have their headquarters be set in the United States, and even theoretically do business with American couples, so long as the embryo-editing and planting takes place in another country where the law is on their side.

There are currently no countries that explicitly allow and regulate heritable embryo gene editing, aka embryo gene editing that results in an actual baby, but there are countries that are relatively more friendly towards the practice than the United States and a group of other countries that don't have any laws explicitly governing it.

Several countries, like China and the United Kingdom allow the embryo editing for research but strictly prohibit it for reproductive purposes. In 2018, China was host to the only documented instance of edited embryos carried to term. The scientist that produced the embryos was sentenced to three years in prison, but went back to work to research embryo gene editing as of last year. In a twist straight out of a book, that researcher is also the former lover of Cathy Tie, the Thiel fellow who co-founded Manhattan Genomics.

Naturally, both startups are on the hunt for just the right place for an operation of this kind. Preventive is looking into stationing their experiments in the United Arab Emirates, while Manhattan Genomics plans to conduct its tests in Honduras, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Even though the current American legal and ethical framework is against the practice, once the industry starts scaling in Silicon Valley, and the scientific advancements start piling up and the money begins pouring in, that could tip the scale in its favor.

In the report, the WSJ claimed that Armstrong, who backs Preventive, had floated a plan to shock the world into acceptance by having startups conduct their work in private and unveil a healthy baby that came from a genetically engineered embryo. However, a spokeswoman for Armstrong denied that he would ever recommend that way of operating for Preventive, and said he had agreed the plan was a bad idea.

The purported goal of both of these startups, and many more emerging, is to end debilitating genetic diseases like sickle cell. If they do succeed in that goal, it could help humanity eradicate many diseases, and even generally tweak babies to boost the immune systems of a new generation.

But there are multiple problems. One is the risk that comes with each gene edit. Even though the technology has gotten significantly better, it's still rather fragile. Edits can still lead to off-target effects that could cause even greater problems than the ones they were trying to erase.

“You don't want to kill or deform a baby just because you were hoping to make him a better violinist,” Caplan said.

The second hurdle is access. Embryo gene editing isn't likely to be a cheap and easy procedure, Caplan points out. So imagine the ethical and societal catastrophe it would present if you have that power only available to a tiny elite minority to make super babies.

The third is that the practice, no matter how many times the people in charge of it claim it would only be used to prevent life-threatening diseases only, could still very easily be the first step to a road that leads to eugenics.

“The way to sell it to the world is through disease prevention or ameliorating genetic diseases, and showing you can do that. Then you start to open the path to ‘how about I start to improve my kids,' which no doubt is the goal of the wealthy out there, they told you this a thousand times,” Caplan said. “Eugenics runs super strong in Silicon Valley.”

Jeff Bezos is branching out.

The 61-year-old Amazon founder is investing $6.2 billion into a new AI company called Project Prometheus, and he'll serve as the startup's co-CEO, according to the New York Times.

The company, which the New York Times has called one of the most well-financed early-stage startups in the world, will focus on building AI to assist engineering and manufacturing operations across industries.

Bezos' co-founder and co-CEO in the venture is physicist and chemist Vik Bajaj. He is best known for his work at Google X, the company's moonshot factory that works on “radical new technology.”  The lab is behind early support for Google-backed companies like robotaxi giant Waymo and life sciences company Verily, which Bajaj co-founded in 2015. Bajaj was most recently the CEO of AI startup incubator Foresite Labs, which he allegedly left to focus on the new venture with Bezos.

Besides Bajaj and Bezos, Project Prometheus has almost 100 employees, including veterans from OpenAI and Meta, according to the New York Times.

Not much else is known about Project Prometheus. The company aims to build AI tools to be used in industries like aerospace and automotive, but there is no information yet on what exactly that would look like, where the company will be based, or when the venture was even started.

The move marks Bezos' first operational role in a company since he abdicated the throne at Amazon to current CEO Andy Jassy in 2021. Bezos has held several other founder positions since then, like at his space company Blue Origin, which shot Katy Perry into orbit earlier this year, but he has not worked as a chief executive in a few years and has largely been living the life of a retiree.

Although his recent personal focus has mostly been the final frontiers of space, Bezos has kept up with the AI hype. Early last year, the multibillionaire invested millions of dollars into Perplexity, an AI company that is after Google's search engine domination.

At a conference last month, Bezos talked about his vision for sending data centers into space, and called artificial intelligence an “industrial bubble” that is not a bad thing, maybe even “good.”

Bezos's latest venture into the AI world is coming at a time when the AI industry is presenting a renewed interest in physical AI. Industry titan Nvidia put physical AI front and center at the company's latest GTC conference in Washington, D.C., last month. Meanwhile, Meta's top AI scientist, Yann LeCun, is reportedly quitting soon to build his own AI startup that would focus on “world models” instead of large language models. World models make up the basis of physical AI.

This isn't the first physical AI venture for Bezos himself, either. The tech executive invested in AI robotics startup Physical Intelligence late last year.

Underlying this recent push towards physical AI in an industry that has been dominated by LLMs in the recent past is a growing fear that improvements in AI capabilities are plateauing. Those fears have never been more openly discussed than after OpenAI's highly anticipated GPT-5 announcement earlier this year was largely deemed a flop by fans. With AI investments continuing to skyrocket, the industry could be looking into physical AI for a much-needed re-injection of hype.

Smart bulbs solve the problem of getting up to flip switches or deal with harsh lighting that kills the mood you're trying to create. Philips Hue bulbs is the most reliable option in the smart lighting category with rock-solid connectivity and millions of color options that actually work as advertised. Philips rarely discounts these bulbs anywhere, so even modest sales are worth grabbing when they appear. Right now, the three-pack of A19 White and Color Ambiance bulbs drops to $99 on Amazon, down from the usual $109. That's an all-time low for this early Black Friday deal, and you won't find Philips Hue discounted anywhere else since Amazon has the exclusive pricing on this one.

See at Amazon

Each A19 bulb emits 60W-equivalent brightness with the ability to shift through millions of colors or adjust white temperature from warm to cool. You just screw them into standard light fixtures and they're ready to go-no complicated installation or wiring required. The White and Color Ambiance range means you get both functional white light for everyday use and the full color spectrum when you want to change the atmosphere.

The bulbs connect directly to your home network or through a Hue Bridge for expanded features. Without the bridge, you get basic control via Bluetooth using the Hue app which is totally fine for single-room setups. Adding a bridge opens up automations, remote control from anywhere and integration with Matter-compatible devices across your smart home. That bridge will also keep your bulbs off your main Wi-Fi network, preventing them from siphoning bandwidth or cluttering up the device list on your router.

With voice control integration through Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit, you'll be able to change lighting without touching your phone. You set up voice commands through the Hue app once, then have your smart speaker dim the lights, change colors, or turn everything off. Response time remains fast and reliable, with virtually no lag between giving a command and seeing the lights change.

Preset scenes manage the basic scenarios of lighting automatically and without users making constant adjustments for the same scene. The 24-hour natural light scene represents sunlight patterns throughout the day and makes gradual transitions from refreshing cool tones in the morning to relaxing warm ones at dusk. Focus mode delivers bright, neutral light that cuts down on eye fatigue during work hours, while unwind scenes use warm, dim lighting to help you relax before bed.

Dynamic light effects add subtle animations where the brightness and color change gradually with the scene rather than remaining static. These are well-suited for movie-watching or game-playing, where lighting can pulse gently along with content without easily becoming distracting. The settings within the app allow you to adjust the speed and intensity of such effects; therefore, you can manage them to be barely noticeable or much more striking, depending on what you're doing.

The A19 form factor fits standard household fixtures, from table lamps to ceiling fixtures to bathroom vanities. These bulbs replace your existing 60W incandescent bulbs directly, and they use way less power while delivering the same brightness. The LED technology means they will last for years instead of burning out after a few months, like traditional bulbs. You're also getting instant-on performance without the warm-up period that some LED bulbs require which means the light hits full brightness the moment you flip the switch or trigger a voice command.

At $99 for three full-color smart bulbs, this deal brings Philips Hue pricing down to a level where competing with cheaper alternatives actually makes sense. You get the reliability and polish that Philips is known for without paying the usual premium, and the early Black Friday timing means you can outfit multiple rooms before the holidays.

Star Wars is the most popular licensed theme for LEGO with just about every build in the lineup rated 4.8 out of 5 stars or higher. The Boarding the Tantive IV set recreates the opening scene from A New Hope where Darth Vader storms the Rebel corridor and it's packed with interactive features that make the battle playable instead of just displayable. Right now, it drops to $43 on Amazon for early Black Friday, down from the usual $54. That's a record low for this model, and it's one of the best-selling LEGO sets during this early discount period. The official LEGO store isn't running this deal, so Amazon has the exclusive price drop.

See at Amazon

The set includes Darth Vader, two Stormtroopers, two Rebel Fleet Troopers, and Captain Antilles to give you both sides of the iconic hallway battle. You also get the 25th Anniversary Clone Trooper Fives mini-figure with a dedicated display stand, which is a collectible exclusive to this set. Fives features updated printing and detailing that makes him more accurate to the Clone Wars series, and the stand keeps him separate from the action scene so you can show him off properly.

The buildable corridor section captures the narrow and claustrophobic feel of the interior of Tantive IV where the Rebels got overwhelmed. Flick levers activate mechanisms that blast open the entrance door and knock over minifigures during battle recreations, adding actual play value instead of static posing. The door mechanism is spring-loaded with a simple design that snaps open with satisfying force, while the toppling feature lets you simulate blaster hits without having to manually move figures around.

With connectors on both ends of the corridor, you can attach multiple 75387 sets together, extending the hallway into a longer battle scene. Snag two or three of these during the sale and you'll build out a more impressive display showing the full scale of the Rebel defeat. The connectors snap together securely without gaps or misalignment, making the extended corridor look like one continuous build instead of obvious sections stuck together.

The 502-piece count hits the sweet spot for builders aged 8 and above, and provides enough complexity to keep things interesting without dragging on for hours. Along the way, the build process teaches basic Lego techniques like SNOT building, where studs face in different directions to create smooth surfaces and angles. You'll work through hinge mechanisms for the door, Technic pins for the toppling feature, and layered construction for the corridor walls.

Accessories include blasters for the troops, a lightsaber for Vader, and smaller details like consoles and wall panels that add texture to the corridor. The Rebel Fleet Troopers come with their distinctive helmets that appeared for maybe 30 seconds in the actual movie but became iconic anyway. Captain Antilles gets his unique torso printing, which fits his brief appearance before Vader chokes him out, and the Stormtroopers feature the classic armor design that every Star Wars fan recognizes.

Right now, you're getting seven mini-figures including an anniversary exclusive, 502 pieces with interactive mechanisms and a build that captures one of the most iconic moments in Star Wars for $43. At a record low price, it's accessible even if you're just getting into LEGO Star Wars collecting, and it's modular so you can expand on it later without having to start from scratch.

Who says Mondays can't have good things? Nintendo casually revealed on the Nintendo app the first real look at Link and Zelda in the upcoming adaptation of The Legend of Zelda. Production recently began, and the official photos show Link (Benjamin Evan Ainsworth) and Zelda (Bo Bragason) separately and together in the land of Hyrule. Check it out.

There they are, that's them!

Filming is on track for the film's release on May 7, 2027. It will take a while until the release, so we would be grateful if you would wait patiently and look forward to it (2/2).

— 任天堂株式会社 (@Nintendo) November 17, 2025



“Filming is underway for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda in a lush, natural setting, with Bo Bragason-san who will play Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san who will play Link,” Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto said in a statement posted on social media. “Filming is on track for the film's release on May 7, 2027. It will take a while until the release, so we would be grateful if you would wait patiently and look forward to it.”

At the moment, Nintendo's not said anything about the plot, but Link's outfit looks inspired by his tunic in Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and Zelda's is from the Champion's Tunic worn by Link in Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. We also know Dicen Lachman is playing Impa, and unofficial set photos suggest she takes some inspiration from her younger appearance in the Breath of the Wild spinoff Age of Calamity. Whether that means this is a straight adaptation of any of the games or the movie is just visually lifting from them, the decision makes sense to lean into the background of the most recent Zelda titles: Breath of the Wild was a shot in the arm for the franchise and gaming and provided a clear entry point for everyone.

That may be the intent, since in 2023, director Wes Ball talked about him and Nintendo wanting to “give fans what they're hoping for and also invite new people in.” Ball, who already had ideas about making a Legend of Zelda movie before he landed the gig, then mentioned wanting to “make something really special. We're not just trying to do it because we can.” They're aiming for something akin to a “live-action Miyazaki” that's nonetheless its own thing.

We'll see how that goes when The Legend of Zelda hits theaters on May 7, 2027.

As memory prices continue to spike, reports say some PC parts buyers in Taiwan must now purchase motherboards alongside DRAM modules to secure supply.

A severe shortage in global DRAM supply has reportedly led some distributors in Taiwan to impose unprecedented bundling requirements on buyers, according to a report in Taiwan's Economic Daily News. It claims that certain channels are now requiring customers to purchase motherboards alongside DRAM modules at a one-to-one ratio, or risk being denied access to memory stock entirely.

This type of allocation control has reportedly never been seen before in the DRAM industry. It appears that distributors are using high-demand memory modules to drive additional board sales, a tactic more common in constrained consumer electronics markets than in the hardware space. Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, and the Chinese board vendor Chaintech are reported as direct beneficiaries of the practice.

The global DRAM memory chip shortage has become so severe that some distributors are requiring clients to buy motherboards with DRAM modules together, an unprecedented move that has sparked hot sales of motherboards, media report, noting Taiwan's Asustek, Gigabyte, MSI are…November 17, 2025

Dan Nystedt, a Taipei-based financial analyst known for translating and tracking Taiwan's tech industry media, relayed the news in a post on X, noting that the bundling policy has “sparked hot sales of motherboards.”

Ultimately, all this reflects how rapidly the memory market has shifted since the start of the year. DRAM contract prices are now up roughly 170% year over year, driven largely by demand from AI server manufacturers, and TrendForce recently raised its Q4 DRAM forecast to 18-23% growth quarter-over-quarter.

On the client side, Mini-PC maker Minisforum recently hiked prices for prebuilt configurations that include DRAM and SSDs, while keeping barebones SKUs untouched, a move it explicitly attributed to “significant increases” in its overall costs.

While the bundling tactic described in Taiwanese media appears to be localized to that market for now, it illustrates how DRAM allocation is tightening across the entire supply chain.

It also highlights how downstream buyers could face new hurdles as hyperscalers and smartphone manufacturers continue to hoover up most of the available capacity.

Kingston Technology has announced its first cable-free SSD. It will hope it has doubled the chances of its debut product getting a warm reception by fitting dual captive USB-A and –C connectors, one at either end of this high-performance memory stick. Kingston's Dual Portable SSD Storage Solution products are available right now. The firm's handy USB 3.2 Gen 2 dual-interface SSD thumb drives are priced between $97 for a 512GB, and $239 for a whopping 2TB model. We might as well also mention, the Goldilocks 1TB model is $144. But, whichever you choose, they all boast “Up to 1,050MB/s read, 950MB/s write” speeds.

The recommended use case for these compact, flexibly interfaced drives is as an affordable, reliable, portable solution for data back-ups and transfers. Specifically, Kingston reckons the Dual Portable SSDs are a good choice “for large files, high-res photos and 4K videos.” It looks like a humble flash drive, albeit with a compact, durable metal casing, but this Kingston offers much better performance than a budget alternative might deliver.

 




“More and more consumers are looking to take their data into their own hands,” said Liny Cheliyan, Business Manager - Prosumer Flash and SSD Kingston EMEA. “Now with the convenience of Kingston's Dual Portable SSD, users can do just that and easily transfer, share, or back up their important files across a variety of USB-A and USB-C devices.”

In addition to the dual-interface flexibility, the broad OS support of the Kingston Dual Portable SSDs will be welcomed by those carting their precious data between systems, places, and platforms. Checking the official specs table data, above, you can see users can easily transfer data between diverse platforms - as long as they sport either a USB-A or USB-C connector (or have an adaptor).

 




These devices look pretty durable, too, which is desirable for easily portable objects that may find themselves rattling around in bags, pockets, or worse. We'd have liked to see some kind of water/dust resistance added to the specs, but the cold/heat durability is welcome.

Kingston is giving buyers of its class as a premium portable flash solution a five-year warranty with free tech support.

Things are heating up again on the server side of CPUs, with both Intel and AMD gunning for the crown. Just yesterday, we covered Granite Rapids-WS, the next launch in the Xeon series, and today we have confirmation from Intel on how Diamond Rapids will shape up. Xeon 7 was originally set to include two lineups: one with 8-channel memory and one with 16-channel, but the former has now been cancelled. Diamond Rapids will therefore be exclusively 16-channel.

Speaking to ServeTheHome, an Intel spokesperson clarified: ""We have removed Diamond Rapids 8CH from our roadmap. We're simplifying the Diamond Rapids platform with a focus on 16-channel processors and extending its benefits down the stack to support a range of unique customers and their use cases.""

The existing Granite Rapids server chips, along with AMD's competing EPYC Turin lineup, top out at 12-channel memory, which will be upgraded to 16-channel with next-gen products from both companies. Previously, when we first reported on Diamond Rapids earlier this year, both the 8CH and 16CH options were said to be on the table. Now, the pivot to only 16-channel memory could result in improved performance, with approximately 1.6 TB/s of memory bandwidth — up from ~844 GB/s.

Those numbers are achieved not just through more DDR5 channels, but also because Diamond Rapids is tipped to ship with 2nd-generation MRDIMM (Multiplexer Rank Dual Inline Memory Modules) that will boost the maximum memory speed from 8,800 MT/s on current-gen Xeon 6 to a whopping 12,800 MT/s. Xeon 7 will also use the new LGA9324 socket, and top out at 192 cores distributed across 4x 48-core compute tiles. Keep in mind that these cores are still not hyper-threaded; that deficiency will be addressed with Coral Rapids afterward.

In the meantime, Diamond Rapids will go up against AMD's EPYC Venice lineup next year, which is rumored to feature up to 256 cores built on the 2nm Zen 6 microarchitecture, so Intel may lose core-count parity, at least on the server side. The now-cancelled 8CH Diamond Rapids would've succeeded existing 8CH Xeon 6 6700P/6500P SKUs that are designed to be cheaper, but cost-effectiveness often goes out the window when it comes to scaling data centers, especially these days.

Older adults with limited resources who participated in a 24-week intervention to manage frailty survived longer, had lower eligibility for long-term care insurance over 66 months, and saved over eight times the program cost.

“[The study] findings support the broader implementation of frailty-targeted interventions, particularly when formulating healthcare policies for aging populations in resource-limited settings,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Sunghwan Ji, MD, MS, of Asan Medical Center at University of Ulsan College of Medicine in Seoul, South Korea. It was published online on November 12, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

This nonrandomized study involved individuals who refused to participate as control participants, which may have introduced selection bias. The results may apply only to individuals included after propensity-score matching. The sample size was relatively small.

This study received support from the Korean Geriatric Society, the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Republic of Korea, and the Asan Institute for Life Sciences.

Pressures on nursing staff in the UK have become “unsustainable”, according to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). The college said its latest employment survey found a rise in nurses working while they are ill because services are so understaffed.

The survey of more than 20,000 nurses found:

The RCN said that the numbers reporting working whilst sick and citing stress as the leading cause of illness both hit eight-year highs. 

The college said that the findings point to the “impossible task” of meeting rising demand with too few staff. Nurses reported feeling “broken” by feeling obliged to work through illness amid chronic understaffing.

The RCN advice line is now receiving an average of six calls a day from members seeking help over understaffing and workplace pressures. It said this is likely an underestimate of the scale of the problem.

Nurses described having panic attacks, nightmares, and exhaustion. Some felt unable to take meal or bathroom breaks, while others avoided annual leave because their departments were already overwhelmed. 

The RCN said the situation is harming both staff wellbeing and patient safety, noting that “unsustainable pressures on staff” are felt “across the UK and in all settings”.

Earlier this year, a separate RCN report found patient-to-nurse ratios in acute settings reaching as high as 50-to-1.

RCN general secretary and chief executive, Professor Nicola Ranger, said: “Nursing staff are being driven to ill health from working in understaffed and under-resourced services. And what's worse, many feel they cannot take time off for fear of leaving their colleagues at the mercy of brutal pressures. This simply isn't sustainable.” 

A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson told Medscape News UK by email: “We hugely value the work of talented nurses, and through our 10-Year Health Plan, we are taking action to improve conditions for the overworked and demoralised workforce we inherited. 

“That includes rolling out high-quality occupational health support, introducing new staff standards to make sure flexible working is more widely available, and cracking down on violence, racism, and sexual harassment in the workplace.”

The RCN re-iterated its call for new investment to grow the nursing workforce and introduce “safety-critical nurse-patient ratios” across all settings.

There are currently more than 25,000 NHS nursing vacancies in England. 

The DHSC said its “graduate guarantee”, announced in August, will create “better job opportunities for qualified nurses and midwives” and ease pressure on existing staff.

The respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein (RSVpreF) vaccine was highly effective against RSV-related acute respiratory illness (ARI) requiring emergency care or hospitalization, including in seniors who required severe oxygen support and those aged 75 years or older.

“Given the introduction of new preventive measures to protect against disease and death due to RSV, expansion of RSV testing is warranted, particularly in high-acuity settings — to better characterize populations at highest risk for RSV infection and potentially to improve treatment algorithms,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Sara Y. Tartof, PhD, Department of Research & Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, California. It was published online on October 21, 2025, in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

A shorter follow-up period after vaccination compared with that in other real-world studies may have contributed to higher VE estimates. Although both RSVpreF and RSVpreF3 were licensed for older adults at the time of this study, the analysis evaluated only RSVpreF. Additionally, low RSVpreF uptake in the first season after licensure but before routine recommendation limited the ability to conduct additional subgroup analyses, particularly among immunocompromised and frail populations.

This study received funding from Pfizer Inc, with financial support provided directly to the institution. Several authors declared being employees of or holding stock and/or stock options in Pfizer, whereas several others declared being KPSC employees. Few authors received research support or honoraria from various pharmaceutical companies.

A pilot study in Leeds will test whether home sampling kits can identify hidden lead exposure in young children, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has announced. 

Current testing requires a clinic visit for a venous blood sample. The new approach uses finger-prick blood spots, household dust and soil samples, and survey data.

Dr Carys Lippiatt, a consultant clinical scientist in biochemistry at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and a member of the study team, said: “This new technique collects an accurately measured blood spot from a finger prick, similar to that used by diabetic children to test blood glucose, allowing samples to be collected in the relaxed environment of the home without a healthcare professional.”

From today, letters will be sent to around 150,000 households in Leeds to recruit 500 participants with children aged 1-6 years. 

The study, called the Elevated Childhood Lead Interagency Prevalence Study (ECLIPS), is funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). 

Researchers selected Leeds as the pilot area because UKHSA data show that Yorkshire and the Humber recorded the highest number of childhood lead poisoning cases over the past decade. 

Higher detection rates in the region have been linked to increased testing and strong local awareness of lead poisoning risks. Researchers believe similar case numbers may exist elsewhere in the UK.

Lead exposure can occur through deteriorating lead-based paint in older homes, contaminated soil, water pipes, soldering, and some consumer products such as jewellery and toys.

“There is no safe level of lead exposure, and while less common today, we can still be exposed in our everyday lives and, crucially, these serious health impacts are preventable,” said Debapriya Mondal, principal epidemiologist at the UKHSA and a member of the study team.

Lead exposure is often asymptomatic, especially at lower levels. When symptoms occur, they may include developmental delays, learning difficulties, irritability, abdominal pain, and hearing loss. 

Pregnant women, unborn babies, and children are among the most vulnerable. According to the UKHSA's Lead Exposure in Children Surveillance System  (LEICSS), boys aged 1-4 years living in older housing in deprived areas are most affected. Common exposure sources include contaminated soil and paint. 

Children with learning or developmental difficulties face even higher risk. UKHSA data show that more than 80% of investigated cases involved persistent eating of non-food items, while 69% involved learning difficulties.

The study is expected to run for 24 months and aims to lay the groundwork for a national screening programme. “This study, even though only carried out in one area, will tell us if this screening method can be widely used to determine the prevalence levels across the United Kingdom,” said Mondal. 

Researchers also hope to identify common exposure sources in UK homes and to test different recruitment approaches to support engagement with diverse communities in future public health research.

They plan to develop a framework that could help monitor other environmental pollutants.

“The methods we develop could be used for other pollutants and diseases that require blood sampling, reducing the need for stressful hospital visits,” the researchers wrote on their project website.

Frequent use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was associated with larger and more durable A1c reductions than CGM nonuse in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) on diverse medications, particularly when CGM was used for more than 270 days per year. 

“The current study, together with other research, strengthens the emerging evidence that CGM may serve as a valuable nonpharmacologic intervention in the management of type 2 diabetes,” an expert wrote in an invited commentary.

The study was led by Irl B. Hirsch, MD, University of Washington Medical School of Medicine, Seattle. It was published online in JAMA Network Open.

The absence of A1c values in the electronic medical records limited the number of patients eligible for analysis. Insurance claims lacked detailed information on the types of prescribed CGMs, patient adherence patterns, and CGM downloads. The random selection of index dates for CGM nonuser patients during the 4-year observation period may have introduced bias.

Although the CDC reports that the fall flu season in the US is currently mild, measles and hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) are surging this fall, according to recent data from Epic Research.

The weekly medically attended HFMD rate in October more than tripled from the highest weekly rate in 2024 in the US overall, but several states are driving the trend, notably Tennessee, which experienced an outbreak involving nearly 178 children and staff at more than 30 child care centers, according to local news reports.

“Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a common viral illness in children caused by enteroviruses; children may feel unwell, with fever and poor appetite, or may limit their intake because of sores in their mouth,” said Lori Handy, MD, MSCE, associate director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and assistant professor of clinical pediatrics at the Perelman School of Medicine, both in Philadelphia, in an interview.

The HFMD rash typically appears on the hands and feet, but can affect any area of the body, Handy said. In most cases, the infection is self-resolving, and children only need supportive care, unless they are too uncomfortable to consume enough fluids, she said.

Proper handwashing remains the best way to reduce the spread of HFMD, which mainly circulates through contact with respiratory secretions as well as stool, said Handy. Caregivers should be reminded to help young children with handwashing after using the toilet, preparing food, or blowing their nose, she added.

The number of measles cases in the US in 2025 is the highest it has been in more than 30 years, Handy told Medscape Medical News. “Measles continues to circulate in the United States, and with the growing trend of families declining measles vaccination, we are seeing outbreaks,” she said. Approximately 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated to prevent transmission, but communities where there are lower rates, some significantly lower, are at high risk for infections spreading, she said.

For example, fewer than 95% of students in some parts of South Carolina have been vaccinated against measles, and these areas are currently seeing outbreaks, said Handy.

As of November 14, 47 cases of measles have been reported in South Carolina since July 9, and 43 of these have occurred in the specific region of Spartanburg County, according to a statement  from the South Carolina Department of Public Health. Vaccination data  from the state show a trend toward declining vaccination rates in this region over the past several seasons.

“Additionally, some cases are being reported that have no known contact with another case of measles, meaning there is ongoing circulation in the community that is going undetected,” Handy added.

Utah remains another hot spot for measles, with 77 diagnosed cases in residents so far in 2025, including 13 cases in the last 3 weeks, according to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.

It's not too late to get vaccinated against the flu, Handy told Medscape Medical News.

Even if this year's vaccine isn't a perfect match, vaccination can reduce severity of illness, she said.

As recently reported by Medscape Medical News, an emerging flu variant may cause an increase in cases as the season progresses. Meanwhile, “RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] season is beginning, and infants eligible for monoclonal antibodies who have not yet received a dose should make an appointment with their care provider. Vaccines for pregnant women are also available at this time,” Handy said.

Handy disclosed having no financial conflicts of interest.

With an increasing intensity and severity of heat waves in the U.S., Rutgers Health researchers, in collaboration with the City University of New York (CUNY), found that older workers, particularly Black, Latino and low-income individuals, face an increased risk of work disability because of exposure to extreme heat.

Their study, published in the journal Generations, explores how heat-sensitive occupations contribute to health-related work limitations among adults aged 50 and older.

Using nationally representative data, the researchers found that workers in outdoor jobs, such as agriculture or construction, or poorly climate-controlled indoor jobs, are more likely to report that health issues limit their ability to work. These occupations are disproportionately held by men, immigrants, and individuals with low socioeconomic status, who are also more likely to have comorbidities, such as obesity or diabetes.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Requirement Survey, 33% of the civilian workforce have jobs that require outdoor exposure.

""Extreme heat is not just an environmental issue, it's a health and workforce issue,"" said Mara Getz Sheftel, an instructor at the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy at the Institute for Health, Health Care Policy and Aging Research and the lead author of the study.

Our findings show that marginalized populations are more likely to be exposed to heat on the job and to suffer long-term health consequences.""

Mara Getz Sheftel, Instructor, Rutgers Center for State Health Policy, Institute for Health

The study also highlights disparities in access to workplace protections and health care. Workers in informal or temporary jobs, such as delivery drivers or street vendors, often lack employer-sponsored health insurance and may be excluded from heat-related safety regulations.

While some states and cities have implemented local regulations around occupational exposures, the study authors call for stronger federal and local policies to protect workers from extreme heat. Proposed rules from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration would require employers to provide water, rest breaks and heat illness prevention plans, but these regulations have yet to be enacted.

""Without comprehensive protections, we risk leaving behind the workers who are most vulnerable to heat-related health impacts,"" said Sheftel, who is also an instructor in the Department of Health, Behavior, Society and Policy at the Rutgers School of Public Health.

The researchers said policymakers should consider preventive measures, such as workplace safeguards and increased access to disability funding and health insurance, as well as vocational training for workers who can no longer perform jobs exposed to heat.

Coauthors of the study include Jennifer Brite of Hunter College and Na Yin and Deborah Balk of Baruch College, who are all faculty at the CUNY Institute for Demographic Research.

Researchers from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, et al. have published a case report entitled ""Acquired immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) associated with inactivated COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac"". This report was published in Frontiers of Medicine, Volume 18, Issue 4, 2024.

Acquired immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare but life-threatening bleeding disorder. Previous studies have reported cases of TTP following administration of mRNA- or adenoviral vector-based COVID-19 vaccines. However, whether inactivated COVID-19 vaccines (such as CoronaVac) could cause TTP and whether the symptoms of TTP cases induced by inactivated vaccines are different from those of previously reported cases remain unclear. The researchers reported two cases of TTP that developed after vaccination with CoronaVac. Both patients developed TTP after receiving the second dose of CoronaVac, with no abnormalities observed after the first dose. They presented with symptoms including fever, neurological abnormalities, renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and hemolysis. Both patients achieved complete remission through several sessions of plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapy. In addition, the study analyzed the incidence of TTP in Nanjing area from 2019 to 2022. The number of newly diagnosed TTP cases during this period was 11, 6, 16, and 17 respectively. The incidence of TTP decreased in 2020 and then increased in 2021-2022, which is presumably related to the administration of COVID-19 vaccines.

This study is the first report on TTP associated with inactivated COVID-19 vaccines such as CoronaVac. The rarity and delayed onset of TTP may be attributed to the relatively milder immune response induced by inactivated vaccines. Timely plasma exchange is a vital treatment for such TTP cases.

A team co-led by University of Pittsburgh's Graham Hatfull has developed a method to construct bacteriophages with entirely synthetic genetic material, allowing researchers to add and subtract genes at will. 

The findings open the field to new pathways for understanding how these bacteria-killing viruses work, and for potential therapies to fight the worsening problem of antibacterial resistance.   

“This will speed up discovery,” Hatfull said. There is massive variation among phages, but researchers don't know the roles played by many individual genes. “How are the genes regulated? What happens if we remove this one or that one? We don't have the answers to those questions,” he said, “but now we can ask–and answer–almost any question we have about phages.” 

Hatfull collaborated with Ansa Biotech and New England Biolabs, combining their unique techniques for synthesizing and assembling DNA with his expertise in phages and mycobacterium. The results of their work were published online this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

The team constructed synthetic DNA modeled after two naturally occurring phages that attack mycobacterium (which include the pathogens responsible for tuberculosis and leprosy, among others). They then added and removed genes, successfully editing the synthetic genomes of both.  

Their work is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

And now, the sky's the limit. You can make any genome you want. You're only limited by what you can imagine would be useful and interesting to make.”

In patients of reproductive age who have cancer, fertility preservation for potential children in the future should be a high priority. A practice article published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250519 describes the successful preservation of ovarian tissue in a young woman undergoing urgent chemotherapy and demonstrates a novel model of care for Canada.

""This case illustrates the complex challenges faced by young patients with cancer who desire biological children but require urgent treatment that threatens their reproductive potential,"" writes Dr. Jennia Michaeli, a fertility specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital, part of Sinai Health, and clinician–investigator and assistant professor at the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, with coauthors.

Unfortunately, many life-saving interventions - including reproductive organ surgery, chemotherapy, and abdominopelvic radiation - increase the risk of infertility and reproductive endocrine dysfunction.""

Dr. Jennia Michaeli, Fertility Specialist, Mount Sinai Hospital

The patient, located 380 km from Toronto, decided to undergo ovarian tissue preservation after being counselled on options, the risks of surgery, and steps in the procedure. The fertility team at Mount Sinai in Toronto coordinated care remotely with the patient's local oncologist and gynecologist to ensure the tissue was removed surgically, then transported under continuous temperature control to a specialized embryology lab at Mount Sinai. 

Despite Canadian guidelines endorsing fertility preservation as a standard of care for patients with cancer, patient distress around survival, a lack of physician knowledge of options, and limited capacity in the system pose barriers to wider adoption of the practice.

This patient's case shows that implementing a centralized ""hub-and-spoke"" model could help open the doors to ovarian tissue cryopreservation for young patients with cancer across Canada.

""We successfully delivered specialized oncofertility services through coordinated care pathways that overcome geographical barriers, which serves as a proof of concept,"" write the authors.

""The described model aims to reduce infertility and reproductive endocrine dysfunction, minimize the psychosocial impact of infertility, and enhance the quality of life for patients and their families by improving access and coordination of care.""

A massive population study reveals that postpartum depression in either parent, especially in both, may signal a substantially higher likelihood of autism in their child, underscoring the importance of early mental-health support for families.

Study: The association between parental postpartum depression and offspring autism spectrum disorder. Image credit: Bogdan Sonjachnyj/Shutterstock.com

Parental postpartum depression is associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorder in infants, as reported by a new study published in Frontiers in Psychiatry. 

Postpartum depression is a type of moderate-to-severe depression that happens to parents after having a newborn. It affects up to 20% of new mothers. Recent evidence suggests that having a history of depression significantly increases the risk of developing postpartum depression.

Psychiatric history of parents has been linked to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in newborns. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one such highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, with symptoms often appearing well before its clinical diagnosis around the age of two to three years.

Recent evidence suggests that maternal psychiatric disorders before pregnancy have a more pronounced influence on an infant's ASD risk than paternal psychiatric disorders. However, the risk is highest in infants with both parents having a psychiatric history. Despite substantial evidence linking parental psychiatric history with neurodevelopmental conditions in infants, studies investigating the impact of parental postpartum depression on infants' ASD risk are largely unavailable.

Researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, USA, and Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, recently addressed this gap in the literature to gain insight into the intergenerational transmission risk for neurodevelopmental outcomes, including ASD.

The study population comprised all live births in Sweden between 1997 and 2021, who were followed up until December 31, 2022.

The study analysis included a total of 1,781,349 infants. In the entire study population, the highest prevalence of ASD was observed among infants with both parents diagnosed with postpartum depression (8.8 %), followed by infants born to fathers with postpartum depression (5.3 %) and infants born to mothers with postpartum depression (4.6 %). 

These estimates corresponded to 2.59-times, 2.56-times, and 5.5-times higher relative risks of ASD among infants with mothers, fathers, and both parents diagnosed with postpartum depression, respectively.

The analysis adjusting for parental depression history, parental age, education, income, and preterm delivery showed a 1.7-times, 1.5-times, and 2-times higher risk of ASD among infants with mothers, fathers, and both parents diagnosed with postpartum depression, respectively.

The analysis, further adjusting for parental antidepressant use, any psychiatric history, and pre-delivery antidepressant use, did not lead to additional reductions in the magnitude of the observed associations.

The study identifies a significant association between parental postpartum depression and increased risk of ASD in infants. According to the findings, the risk of ASD in infants increases at a similar rate if either of the parents is diagnosed with postpartum depression. However, infants with both parents diagnosed with postpartum depression are at the highest risk of developing ASD.

Notably, the study finds a partial reduction in the magnitude of observed associations when potential confounding factors, including parental history of depression, antidepressant use, or any psychiatric history before delivery, are adjusted in the analysis.

The time surrounding birth is a critical time for early developmental events in infants. Several studies have linked parental depression to adverse neurodevelopmental consequences in infants, including cognitive and speech impairments, behavioral issues, poor adjustment, growth delay, and lack of fine motor skills.

However, it largely remains unknown whether these adversities are associated explicitly with parental postpartum depression, parental depression, or other psychiatric disorders. Although genetic factors play a substantial role in triggering neurodevelopmental complications in infants, a possible contribution of environmental risk factors and their interactions with genetic risk factors must be considered.

Existing evidence highlights that genes inherited from parents play a major role in ASD pathogenesis. The current study's observations of increased ASD risk due to maternal and paternal postpartum depression, and the highest ASD risk due to parental (both mother and father) postpartum depression, suggest that common genetic variants may be inherited from both parents.

Notably, the study finds that this combined risk from parental postpartum depression is reduced when the analysis is adjusted for the depression history of parents, highlighting the shared impact of genetic and environmental factors on ASD risk.

The Swedish National Patient Register (NPR) was used in the study to obtain diagnoses of depression. Since this register does not include diagnoses from primary care, the study could not analyze data from individuals with depression who did not visit health care facilities.

Furthermore, the study could not include parents with ASD diagnosed exclusively before 1987 because of data unavailability. Parental ASD might be a potential confounding factor that needs to be addressed in future studies. Genetic confounding may also have occurred if parents with postpartum depression are a specific group with a higher inherited risk of ASD.

Today marks the first World Cervical Cancer Elimination Day – mandated by the World Health Assembly – a historic milestone in global efforts to end a preventable cancer. This day of action builds on powerful momentum, with countries and partners uniting to launch ambitious vaccination campaigns, expand screening and treatment services, and accelerate progress toward eliminating cervical cancer as a public health problem.

The annual commemoration highlights a critical opportunity: cervical cancer – the fourth most common cancer in women – claims over 350 000 lives each year, yet it is a disease that we have the tools to eliminate.

The Day supports the core pillars of the WHO's global elimination strategy: vaccinating 90% of girls against human papillomavirus (HPV), screening 70% of women, and treating 90% of those with pre-cancer and invasive cancer. It serves as a critical platform to strengthen advocacy, accelerate service delivery, and mobilize resources to ensure every woman and girl has access to life-saving care.

In 2018, I was proud to launch the global call to action on cervical cancer elimination, and I'm even prouder now to see what was once a distant dream becoming a reality. More and more countries are scaling up HPV vaccination, improving screening, and expanding treatment, bringing us closer to a future free of cervical cancer.""

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General

This momentum is underscored by the announcement from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and its partners, who estimate that the ambitious goal to reach 86 million girls by the end of 2025 has been met, reflecting a broader wave of country action to advance national elimination plans and expand access to screening and treatment.

Countries are marking World Cervical Cancer Elimination Day with a wave of actions on multiple fronts. Vaccination is scaling up through campaigns in Sierra Leone and Liberia targeting over 1.5 million girls. Screening efforts are also intensifying, with Sierra Leone planning a mass campaign across all 16 districts, followed by an awareness walk. Meanwhile, in Malaysia, advocacy is taking center stage as survivors lead a week-long promotion of self-sampling HPV testing, a key innovation for expanding screening access.

This past year has seen significant country-level action, providing a powerful foundation for the new annual commemoration.

Countries worldwide are accelerating efforts to expand access to HPV vaccination, screening, and treatment, advancing toward the 90-70-90 targets of the Global Strategy.

Veterans with Gulf War Illness experienced significant improvement in migraine symptoms after following a diet low in glutamate, a component of flavor enhancing food additives commonly found in processed foods, according to new research presented by Georgetown University and American University scientists. Brain scans also revealed decreased cortical thickness in patients on the diet - providing evidence, for the first time, that the improvement in symptoms was linked to measurable changes in the brain. 

The findings point to a potential low-cost treatment option for veterans struggling with chronic neurological symptoms since the 1990-1991 Gulf War. Because cortical thickening has previously been linked to migraines more broadly, the study also suggests that a low-glutamate diet could provide relief to a much larger population. 

This was exciting, because it shows that the brain itself is responding and changing. This isn't a psychological reaction. These are actual changes in the brain related to the diet.""

Ashley VanMeter, PhD, study's senior author, professor of neurology, Georgetown University School of Medicine

The findings were presented November 16 during at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego.

Gulf War Illness is a chronic condition affecting more than a quarter of veterans who served in the first Gulf War. It can cause an array of debilitating musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and neurologic symptoms, including migraines, and is thought to be caused by exposure to neurotoxic chemicals during the war. 

Glutamate, which is found in high levels in processed foods and also occurs naturally in some foods like tomatoes and mushrooms, is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, where it is known to play a role in mediating pain. 

The new research, which was funded by the Department of Defense (DOD W81XWH1710457), grew out of a collaboration with Kathleen Holton, PhD, MPH, a nutritional neuroscientist at American University, who developed the low-glutamate diet and has been researching it as an approach to managing neurological conditions. The low-glutamate diet is currently being studied in a large multi-site clinical trial to confirm these findings in patients with Gulf War Illness. 

""This was an exciting opportunity to see if we can do something for these veterans who have literally been suffering since the 1990s,"" VanMeter said.

For the study, researchers first used brain scans to compare differences in cortical thickness between patients with Gulf War Illness and a group of healthy patients. Those with Gulf War Illness had a significantly thicker right visual cortex. This group was also significantly more likely to report experiencing migraines than the healthy group. 

Then in a follow-up study, researchers had patients with Gulf War Illness follow a low-glutamate diet. After a month, scans showed that cortical thickness in this group was significantly reduced. 

Researchers also observed a ""big, big decrease"" in migraines and headaches, VanMeter noted. 

""More than half of the Gulf War veterans had migraines before the diet, and that dropped to under 20% after following the diet for one month,"" she said. ""So it was a very significant drop.""

Holton said the findings support the team's theory that glutamate may be contributing to the symptoms of Gulf War Illness by driving excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in the brain; and that these three processes then continue to trigger each other in an ongoing cycle. 

""We think this is one of the reasons people who are susceptible to dietary glutamate tend to have prolonged symptoms over time,"" she explained. 

The researchers noted that other symptoms also improved in the low-glutamate group, including significant reductions in widespread pain, fatigue, mood issues, and cognitive dysfunction. The team plans to publish additional findings from their current ongoing study. 

While not universal, thickening of the visual cortex, part of the brain linked to vision, is common among migraine sufferers, especially those whose migraines occur with aura, or visual disturbances. 

That raises the question of whether a low-glutamate diet could also benefit the wider population of migraine sufferers, potentially even as an alternative to medication, VanMeter said. 

""This is a very doable diet,"" she said. ""It's a healthy diet, it's not that hard to follow, and it's a very low-cost way of treating what for some individuals is a chronic and debilitating condition."" 

Holton noted that the study also adds to a growing body of evidence about how ultra-processed foods impact health.

""This speaks to the fact that diet can not only make us sick, but can also acutely treat our symptoms,"" she said.

Follow-up research is underway to expand on the findings and investigate if weakening of the blood-brain barrier plays a role in glutamate sensitivity.

Addition authors of the study include Crowder HD, Booker DT, Dragoi SM, Baraniuk JN.

Physician responses to patient expectations can affect physician incomes and may help explain lower incomes for many women, racialized, and immigrant physicians, found a new study published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250665.

Researchers from McMaster University aimed to understand persistent identity-related income differences among physicians practising in Canada. They conducted a qualitative study that included interviews with 55 Ontario family physicians.

""Pay disparities related to gender, race, and immigration status persist among Canadian physicians, even within specialties and after adjusting for hours worked,"" says Dr. Meredith Vanstone, professor, Department of Family Medicine and Canada Research Chair in Ethical Complexity in Primary Care at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario.

This is seen in family medicine, even though physicians are typically paid via standardized fee schedules. Our study demonstrates that physician responses to the expectations they perceive from patients may contribute to these pay gaps. They told us that patient expectations differ depending on their identities and the identities of the patients.""

Dr. Meredith Vanstone, Professor, McMaster University

""Physicians respond to perceived patient expectations by adjusting their practice and behaviour, including the way they interact, the length of an appointment, and the services they provide,"" says Dr. Monika Dutt, PhD candidate at McMaster University and family physician. ""These are decisions that may ultimately impact income.""

As more women and international medical graduates are practising medicine in Canada, income inequalities are important to understand and address, particularly as incomes for medical specialties with high proportions of women physicians have been declining relative to incomes in other specialties.

""Since providing longer, more comprehensive patient interactions limits the number of appointments or services that physicians can provide, women may experience financial disadvantages in compensation models that depend on roster size or patient volume,"" the authors write.

To address pay disparities, the authors suggest that compensation models could adjust for extra time required for some types of care. The fee schedule should be examined to make sure that services associated with female anatomy (e.g., pelvic exams, IUD insertion) are not underpaid.

""Ontario family physicians are responsive to the expectations of their patients. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it is likely to result in satisfied patients whose needs are well met,"" Dr. Vanstone emphasizes.

""These findings may be relevant to physician workforce planning and ensuring team-based care that accounts for physician backgrounds and skills to improve patient outcomes,"" the authors conclude.

A new evidence review reveals how everyday mushrooms can nudge cardiometabolic markers in the right direction and even prime frontline immune defenses, offering a simple, whole-food strategy for healthier meals.



Review: Mushroom consumption impacts on biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease risk and immune function: a narrative review from a whole food perspective. Image Credit: YRABOTA  / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in the journal Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, a group of authors synthesized human and mechanistic evidence on how the consumption of whole mushrooms influences biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease risk and immune function.

One in three adults worldwide will develop cardiovascular disease, stroke, or type 2 diabetes mellitus. For many families, warning signs such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, creeping fasting plasma glucose, and higher blood pressure often emerge through ordinary meals, long commutes, and tight budgets.

Mushrooms are unusual “other vegetables”: low in energy but rich in fiber, potassium, selenium, B vitamins, beta-glucan, chitin, and L-ergothioneine. Ultraviolet-exposed mushrooms also provide vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol).

These features make them easy swaps for part of meat or refined starch in daily cooking. Further research is needed to clarify the causal effects, optimal amounts, species differences, and the limited evidence base regarding the consumption of mushrooms within an overall healthy dietary pattern.

Mushrooms are fungi, not plants, bringing a distinct package of nutrients and bioactives that complement common vegetables. Beta-glucan and chitin slow gastric emptying and blunt post-meal glucose spikes, potassium supports vasodilation, and L-ergothioneine is a sulfur-containing antioxidant amino acid concentrated in mushrooms.

When exposed to ultraviolet light, mushrooms produce vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), which is beneficial in areas with low sun exposure. 

In kitchens, their natural glutamate and 5′-ribonucleotides contribute to the umami flavor, allowing home cooks to reduce salt and saturated fat without compromising flavor, which is particularly beneficial for families concerned about blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

Across human research included in this narrative synthesis, 22 original studies (16 experimental and 6 observational) assessed mushrooms as part of either a “self-chosen diet” (where people incorporated mushrooms into their existing habits) or a “healthy dietary pattern” emphasizing minimally processed, vegetable-rich foods.

Experimental doses typically ranged from 13 to 300 grams per day (wet weight), far higher than the average public intake of about 1.4–1.6 kilograms per year (≈approximately 4 grams per day) in the United States.

Outcomes commonly tracked included low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein (CRP, an inflammation biomarker), and salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA, an immune biomarker).

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were generally small and short, so consistency matters more than single p-values.

In self-chosen diets, consuming mushrooms consistently reduced serum triglycerides, with neutral effects on HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and CRP.

When mushrooms were consumed as part of a healthier overall dietary pattern, fasting plasma glucose levels decreased in the single healthy dietary pattern trial available, plausibly through fiber-mediated, slower carbohydrate absorption and improved satiety.

Limited evidence also suggests potential improvements in blood pressure, though results remain preliminary. Culinary strategies, such as “blend-and-extend” meat and mushroom mixtures, can reduce meal energy, sodium, and saturated fat; however, these are culinary applications rather than outcomes demonstrated in the reviewed human trials.

Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was not universally measured; however, mechanistic expectations (fiber, potassium, and L-ergothioneine effects on glycemia, endothelial stress, and oxidative balance) align with the observed trends. Importantly, no signs of harm were observed for any biomarker assessed.

Immune outcomes are practical when they translate into fewer infections or better vaccine responses; intermediate markers help us get there. Several studies reported increases in salivary IgA after regular mushroom intake.

For systemic inflammation, CRP findings were largely neutral in self-chosen diets; heterogeneity in species, dose, and duration likely contributed to this result. Mechanistically, mushroom polysaccharides (notably beta-glucan and chitin) can activate pattern-recognition receptors on innate immune cells, “training” immunity without provoking excessive cytokine release.

L-ergothioneine may support the glutathione (GSH) system and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), potentially lowering oxidative stress that sustains chronic inflammation.

These pathways are biologically plausible; however, larger, longer human trials are needed to confirm their clinical relevance.

Mushrooms provide nutrients that many diets lack: fiber (for microbiome and glycemic control), potassium (for blood pressure), and L-ergothioneine (essentially unique to fungi). Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) can be meaningful in winter or for indoor workers if packs are labeled “ultraviolet-exposed.”

Species matter: Agaricus bisporus (white and brown/portobello), Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster), and Lentinula edodes (shiitake) differ in beta-glucan content and bioactives; culinary diversity can spread benefits while keeping meals enjoyable.

For households, one can start small but frequently. Add 75–100 grams on most days, sliced into weekday curries, stir-fries, eggs, or sandwiches, or use mushrooms to substitute for part of the meat in patties, tacos, or pasta sauces for culinary and nutritional benefits, while preserving savor. Pair with legumes and whole grains to raise fiber and micronutrients. Choose mixtures you enjoy; adherence is better than perfection.

Schools, hospitals, and canteens can “blend-and-extend” meat dishes by replacing a portion of the meat with mushrooms to reduce sodium and saturated fat while maintaining acceptance and controlling costs. By framing mushrooms as familiar whole foods rather than pills or powders, they can further improve trust and uptake.

Across human studies, whole mushroom consumption appears safe and practically useful, with consistent reductions in triglycerides on self-chosen diets, lower fasting plasma glucose in a single healthy dietary pattern trial, limited but positive evidence for blood pressure improvements, and early signals of improved salivary IgA levels.

Effects on LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and CRP are generally neutral; importantly, no adverse biomarker effects were identified. Given their fiber, potassium, L-ergothioneine, and potential vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), mushrooms fit seamlessly into everyday meals and institutional menus. 

Larger, longer RCTs should define causal impacts, optimal doses, and species differences, and clarify the effects of consuming mushrooms within an overall healthy dietary pattern.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study uncovers how tumors exploit a molecular signal to exhaust T cells","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251117/Study-uncovers-how-tumors-exploit-a-molecular-signal-to-exhaust-T-cells.aspx","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 12:24:00 GMT","

A new study has discovered a molecular signal that tumors exploit to exhaust the T cells meant to destroy them-and how silencing that signal could revive the body's immunity. The study led by Weill Cornell Medicine researchers was published Nov. 17 in Nature Immunology and shows that tumors not only evade the immune system but can actively reprogram immune cells to stop fighting.

""Our dream is to make immune-based therapies available to every patient. To overcome resistance, we must unlock the power of exhausted T cells, reviving them to destroy cancer. This discovery moves us closer to a future where the immune system itself defeats tumors,"" said the study's co-senior author, Dr. Taha Merghoub, Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor in Oncology Research, and professor of pharmacology at Weill Cornell Medicine.

In recent years, immunotherapy has transformed cancer care, offering a way to rally the body's own immune system to fight tumors. But even with these advances, many patients still don't respond-or their initial response fades as their immune cells become exhausted.

Our findings reveal a completely new way that tumors suppress the immune system. By blocking this pathway, we can help exhausted T cells recover their strength and make existing immunotherapies work better for more patients.""

Dr. Jedd Wolchok, co-senior author, the Meyer Director of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, professor of medicine, Weill Cornell and oncologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center

T cell exhaustion is a phenomenon triggered by continued exposure to chronic infections or tumors that activate the immune system. The embattled immune cells remain capable of recognizing their foes, but they no longer attack them. ""So, they're primed, but they're no longer killing,"" said Dr. Merghoub, who is also deputy director of the Meyer Cancer Center and co-director of the Parker Institute of Cancer Immunotherapy at Weill Cornell. ""Although such cellular surrender may seem counterproductive, it serves as a brake to protect against out-of-control inflammation and sepsis,"" Dr. Merghoub said.

Previous work from other labs has demonstrated that a protein called PD1 on the surface of T cells plays a key role in putting the brakes on T cells. Checkpoint-inhibitor drugs, which target PD1, have been remarkably successful in reviving T cells to treat cancers such as melanomas. 

The researchers started out investigating whether CD47 molecules present on cancer cells contributed to T cell exhaustion. Previous studies showed that tumors can use CD47 to instruct the immune cells that normally engulf invaders to stand down-a skill that prompted its nickname as a ""don't eat me signal.""

But they were surprised to discover that CD47 has another function on the surface of T cells. ""When T cells are activated, they express CD47. And when they get exhausted, they increase CD47 to very high levels,"" Dr. Merghoub said.

Their experiments found that mice lacking CD47 had delayed tumor growth. This suggested CD47 on the animal's immune cells, not the CD47 on the cancer cells, was causing exhaustion. They suspected that eliminating CD47 on T cells could be beneficial. When tested in mice with melanoma, T cells lacking CD47 were better at fighting the cancer than T cells, which had CD47 intact.

The researchers turned their attention to how the cancer cells coopted T-cell CD47 to promote exhaustion. They focused on a large protein called thrombospondin-1 that interacts with CD47 and is produced by metastatic cancer cells. When they tested mice lacking thrombospondin-1, they found that T cells were less exhausted. ""That was the real eureka moment,"" said Dr. Merghoub. ""It showed us that CD47 and thrombospondin are clearly key players because eliminating either one gives you the same effect.""

To better understand what was happening, the researchers used the TAX2 peptide that was designed to selectively disrupt the interaction between CD47 and thrombospondin-1 in their mouse tumor models. Their suspicions were confirmed: TAX2 preserved T-cell function and slowed down tumor progression in mice with melanoma or colorectal tumors.

The T cells in treated mice stayed more active, produced more immune boosting cytokines and were better at infiltrating tumors. In addition, TAX2 worked in synergy with PD-1 immunotherapy in controlling colorectal tumor growth.

""We used the TAX2 peptide as a proof-of-concept to confirm that disrupting the crosstalk between TSP-1 and CD47 prevents T cell exhaustion in mice with tumors,"" said Dr. Chien-Huan (Gil) Weng, an instructor in pharmacology and the study's lead author. ""Next, we plan to study both upstream and downstream modulators that regulate the TSP-1:CD47 pathway and develop means to selectively, effectively and safely disrupt this pathway to improve T cell-based cancer immunotherapy.""

Targeting this interaction would be a valuable therapeutic on its own, but it could also help preserve tumor-reactive T cells in patients who would otherwise develop resistance to the currently available T cell-based immune checkpoint inhibitors. Even more promising, experiments in preclinical tumor models suggest that blocking both PD1 and CD47 produces T cells that are more effective at killing cancer cells, Dr. Merghoub said. ""We plan to explore this therapeutic angle.""

There is no doubt that when fans of the US Women's National Team think of entertainment, they will think of Tobin Heath. The forward brought a remarkable flare and flash and plenty of hardware to her storied legacy with the team. 

She won two World Cups, two Olympic gold medals and a bronze medal. She is now being honored as receiving induction into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in her first year of eligibility. 

She just recently announced her retirement and then appeared on the player's ballot. It was quickly voted on that she would be selected. It should come as no surprise to many who followed her career.

In addition to her time representing her country, she won three national titles at the University of North Carolina and twice earned a ring as a member of the Portland Thorns in the NWSL. 

It is unfortunate that knee injuries slowed her career, as Heath was one of the best dribblers and passers that the United States let alone the world saw on the pitch. Throughout her career she dazzled both spectators and teammates with how she handled the ball anytime it came her way. 

The last time she laced it up for the United States National Team was in 2021. She returned after a knee injury.  She scored in her first two games back against Mexico. It kicked off a bronze medal the 2021 Olympics in Japan. 

She has been a great ambassador for both women's soccer and women's sports as a whole. Together with her wife and fellow National Team soccer star, Christen Press, she has founded Re-Inc. Its aim is to rebrand and have an inclusive environment for all sports and genders. 

Heath will join fellow icon, Heather O'Reilly in a strong class that will be officially inducted in 2026 in Frisco, Texas. In a few years, her wife in Press will more than likely be joining Heath in Frisco at the Hall of Fame. 

During the run that saw the National Team win their fourth World Cup and second consecutive in 2019, Heath was one of the stars. Never more apparent than in the match against Sweden. 

In a 2-0 victory for the United States was named the Player of the Match for ""Tireless running and a forcing goal to seal victory"". 

It was a perfect way to describe an exciting player who now will be forever remembered in the Hall of Fame.

The Spirit head to the NWSL finals after win over the Thorns (1:11)

NJ/NY Gotham FC and Washington Spirit are locked in for the NWSL Championship after a pair of pulsating semifinals.

Jeff Kassouf breaks down all the action from the NWSL's penultimate weekend.

ORLANDO, Fla. -- As Sunday's NWSL semifinal at Inter&Co Stadium crept deeper into stoppage time, Orlando Pride forward Marta was already planning for extra time -- and for a return to the championship and the Bay Area, where she called home 15 years ago.

In a semifinal filled with stars but devoid of much attacking action, the Brazil icon shone the brightest again -- until the seventh minute of stoppage-time, when NJ/NY Gotham FC's Jaedyn Shaw curled a free kick into the goal and sent her team to next week's NWSL Championship with a 1-0 victory over the defending champions.

Marta played as Orlando's No. 9 on Sunday, an unspoken acknowledgement of the absence of injured forward Barbra Banda, whose near-MVP form last year helped carry the Pride to a championship after a 23-game unbeaten streak to start the season. This year's Orlando team was far more inconsistent, including an eight-game winless streak in the summer that, at one point, left them on the brink of the playoff line.

They pulled it together in the fall and appeared to find their groove in a quarterfinal victory over the Seattle Reign last week. On Sunday, Orlando was certainly the better team -- Gotham generated a measly 0.17 expected goals, and their only shot on goal was the winner in the 100th minute -- but the Pride's faults caught up with them. Chiefly, a struggle to finish chances in front of net.

""I think we were so resilient this season,"" Marta said. ""I don't know if, besides us, people believed we would go so far, especially after we lost Barbra [Banda]. The team needed to find a way to work a little bit more and better together and run for each other and open spaces for each other and expect that everyone can score goals because we didn't have Barbra there.""

Marta, with her captain's armband next to her on the table, stopped talking several times during her 15-minute press conference to calm her emotions and hold back tears. She pointed to the star on her jersey above Orlando's crest, representing the championship the team won last year.

""We have one,"" she said, moving her jersey so the cameras could see. ""This star, it's made by everybody -- everybody. Which means I prefer to have one star with so many people around who work for one objective, one goal [than] so many others who believe they're a star.

""At the end of the day, this doesn't work. We had a team here [circa 2017] with so many stars in it. What did we win? Nothing.""

The 39-year-old Brazilian, a six-time world player of the year, would not commit to what her future looks like. She signed a two-year contract extension in January to stay with the Pride through 2026, and while the brutal reality is that one of these games will actually, finally be her last -- a day the world of soccer should collectively mourn -- she continues to defy time and age.

She did it last year as she pushed the Pride to their first trophies while scoring nine goals. She did again -- nearly, anyway -- on Sunday from the opening whistle, fighting for 50-50 balls with Gotham defender Jess Carter, yelling at the ref as she so frequently and passionately does, and creating the Pride's few clear opportunities.

None looked more promising than in the 33rd minute, when Marta rolled over the ball with her left foot at the top of Gotham's penalty area and played the ball wide to Julie Doyle, who squeezed a low cross through three Gotham defenders toward the back post. Gotham defender Emily Sonnett's slight redirect with her toe changed the trajectory of the ball, and it evaded Pride winger Jacquie Ovalle at the back post of an empty net.

That moment was the most clear-cut opportunity for either team in the game, one that came through buildup play rather than in transition. Marta's left foot nearly saved Orlando's season in the final play of the match, when she delivered a free kick to the head of Oihane Hernández, but Gotham goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger made a diving save to prevent the equalizer.

Orlando head coach Seb Hines said after Sunday's loss that he was proud of how the team has evolved from being ""one-dimensional"" in transition last year to a squad that can keep the ball.

""If we can combine the two ways of playing then we can be a really threatening team going into next year,"" Hines said. ""I don't think we need to add a whole lot; we just need to be more consistent.""

Banda's return will bring back more of those dangerous transition moments. She sustained a season-ending adductor injury in August. And as the Pride's playoff run showed, they still have the foundation of a title-contending team.

Center back Emily Sams put on another masterclass in one-on-one defending, Ovalle has finally found her rhythm after a then-record $1.5 million transfer in August, and role players from Hernández -- who brought a spark to the Pride's right side in the second half on Sunday -- to Doyle provide depth for Orlando. The offseason will absolutely bring changes, as is a custom in the NWSL -- especially with two expansion teams joining.

And like last year, plenty of questions will center around Marta. Will she keep playing? She didn't exactly answer that on Sunday, instead saying she will to Brazil to see her family and take a vacation. And if she does play, can she keep defying logic with such incredible performances? She will turn 40 before the start of the next NWSL season.

Those questions still loom, as they did last year after the team's emotional championship -- her first in the NWSL. Marta said she was hungry before Sunday's game but she couldn't eat in anticipation of the big game. She'd have been forgiven for not seeing it as such, having played in World Cup and Olympic finals.

But as she expounded raw, emotional analysis of the Pride's season just moments after it had ended, she made it clear that the fire inside of her was alive and well.

""I'm not here to waste my time,"" Marta said. ""I never was. I am still hungry. I am not playing because of what I did in the past. I still feel like I can do something for this team, for my teammates, for my staff. I care so much. I care.

""I don't know how long I'm gonna keep like that, but I still care so much, and I hope that we come back next year with the same mentality, a strong mentality, same belief, same attitude, because this team deserves much more.""

Time appeared to slow down for Washington Spirit forward Rosemonde Kouassi as she chased down the ball on the sideline 27 minutes into her team's 2-0 NWSL semifinal victory over the Portland Thorns on Saturday at Audi Field.

Kouassi practically flew to the sideline as she kept the ball in bounds and left Thorns defender Kaitlyn Torpey in her dust. It took exactly 16 seconds for the ball to go from Thorns midfielder Olivia Moultrie's foot for a Thorns corner kick to the back of the opposite net, some 120 yards away, where Gift Monday tapped in a pass from Kouassi.

The goal punctuated a suffocating first half of pressure from the Spirit and clinched Washington a second consecutive trip to the NWSL Championship. The goal also perfectly encapsulated the Spirit's recent success: two unsung heroes carrying the load for a team hellbent on outworking their opponents.

Kouassi and Monday have quietly carried a Spirit team that has labored through injuries this season and operated -- very much against their will and to the chagrin of head coach Adrián González during news conferences -- in the shadow of forward Trinity Rodman's stardom.

The onlooking world had already been watching Rodman's every move to see if the U.S. women's national team star would play again in these playoffs after spraining her MCL last month. Then came Saturday morning, when it appeared more than ever that Rodman might be suiting up for the Spirit at home for the final time due to more lucrative offers abroad for the impending free agent.

A few hours later, Rodman made a cameo in the 90th minute and came within inches of scoring in stoppage time in front of a raucous, sold-out stadium of more than 19,000 fans. A goal would have been fitting -- Rodman scored a stoppage-time winner in August at Audi Field against the Thorns after another long injury layoff -- but it wasn't necessary. This isn't a Spirit team built solely around Rodman, but one whose depth has been tested and proven through a mountain of injuries this season.

Kouassi pulled the strings from the opening whistle, as she had a week earlier in the quarterfinal and on countless other occasions this season. ""Queen,"" Spirit defender Esme Morgan said to describe Kouassi, before Spirit midfielder Croix Bethune jumped in with her own singular description: ""baller.""

Monday had a goal called back after four minutes, when she appeared to be narrowly offside. The warning shot was fired, and Washington kept its collective foot on the gas to make Portland, the franchise with more playoff appearances than any other in league history, look like a rattled newcomer too wide-eyed for the occasion.

Monday and Kouassi eventually linked up for a goal that counted, just as they had a week earlier, when Monday was just days removed from returning from her father's funeral in Nigeria and overcome with emotion.

In Saturday's semifinal, Bethune scored the insurance goal in the 83rd minute when she picked off an ill-advised back pass from Thorns defender Sam Hiatt, tapped the ball around goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold, and nearly walked the ball into the back of the net.

For all the Spirit's dominance throughout the run of play, it would be easy to argue that the difference in Saturday's semifinal was a pair of mistakes from the Thorns. And while Portland should be commended for its own resilience to even reach a semifinal amid its own injury problems, the Spirit's semifinal victory cannot be diluted into luck or fine margins. This is a team that has earned its way back to a second straight championship match in what many consider to be the most competitive league in the world.

González spoke at length last week about the team's mental and psychological preparations. Those preparations, he argued at one point after his team's quarterfinal victory over Racing Louisville, are even more important than tactics. The Spirit, who have made a habit of going to extra time in the postseason, had just won a penalty shootout at home in the playoffs for the second straight year. Their perseverance was no coincidence.

Extra time was not necessary on Saturday. González said on Saturday that the hard work from earlier this year is now paying off through ""muscle memory."" The Spirit's mature mentality and experience shone through from the opening whistle. Kouassi ran rampant on the right flank. Kate Wiesner, filling in for injured full back Gabby Carle, wreaked havoc on the left side. Center back Tara McKeown started after leaving the quarterfinal injured, and she, Morgan and Rebeca Bernal set a high defensive line to regain the ball high and pin the Thorns into their own defensive half.

""I didn't want them to think too much, because sometimes when you are overthinking, you cannot express your talent,"" González said. ""So, we've been believing that in the past, so now it is not time to think; it's time to play with that flow, with that creativity that we have.""

This is a team whose depth and quality has been tested and proven through multiple injuries to Rodman, three starting-quality players absent on maternity leave and, for the second straight year, a dramatic midseason coaching change. All the while, Washington steadily picked up points and momentum in the shadow of the Kansas City Current's record-breaking season.

Washington, however, is the team still alive in these playoffs. The Spirit are riding the streak of less heralded stars. Their experience as a group having gone through last year's heartache and hard lessons is paying off this postseason.

It feels like eons ago that the Spirit won the NWSL Challenge Cup in a championship rematch against the Orlando Pride. Washington celebrated that penalty shootout victory in Orlando with a distinct taste of revenge, however minor, for last year's final.

Now, the Spirit will get a shot at true vengeance on Nov. 22 in San Jose, Calif. at the NWSL Championship.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Mauricio Pochettino has called for fans to step up their support of the U.S men's national team as preparations for the 2026 FIFA World Cup continue—specifically by attending games in greater numbers in order to build a closer bond with the players.

After beating Paraguay 2–1 in Chester, Pennsylvania to open the November international window, the Argentine manager pleaded with fans to care more intensely in the lead-up to next summer's tournament. 

“In Argentina, Argentina is more important than any name. In Brazil, the same. In England, the same. In Spain, the same,” Pochettino said to reporters post-match. “In every country, it's the same. So we need our fans to follow and support the national team. We need to build that relationship.”

While the game saw an announced attendance of 17,224, it marked the 15th city that the U.S. has played in in 2025. At the same time, several fans also took to online platforms to share their concerns about ticket prices, which have been a consistent sticking point for many supporters. 

“Our fans need to be fans of the USA men's national team and follow our crest, our flag, our colors. That's the most important,” Pochettino continued. “Who's the hero? The team. The team needs to be the hero. If we're able to attract our fans to support us, we can create a very good [relationship] between us and be very, very strong.

“The players need the energy from the fans. That is an important thing so that's my message to our fans.”

It isn't the first time that Pochettino has been frustrated with American supporters, either. In September, in a flustered press conference that followed a 2–0 loss to South Korea at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J.—in front of a largely pro-Korean crowd—he begged Americans to “please come” to support the national team in the lead-up to next year's tournament. 

That match marked the final loss before the USMNT embarked on their current five-game undefeated run. 

“Please come more [to the games],” Pochettino urged fans after the match, which at the time was the USMNT's seventh loss against a top 30 opponent in their last eight games. “My message to the fans is that we're going to arrive at the World Cup in the best condition and we're going to be difficult to defeat.”

There remains hope that the crowds at the World Cup will be largely pro-USMNT, as the country has led World Cup ticket sales globally through the first several stages of ticketing

The U.S. Men's National Team is back in Tampa, Fla. for the first time since 2018 as it faces World Cup-bound Uruguay on Tuesday evening in an international friendly at Raymond James Stadium. The contest between the North and South American powers marks the 10th match the USMNT has played in Tampa.

From a pair of positive results against European opposition to Landon Donovan's hat-trick heroics, take a look back at some of the USMNT's most memorable moments across four decades and three venues in Tampa.

United States 1 – 1 Switzerland (2/8/85)

The USMNT took the field in Tampa for the first time back in 1985, hosting Switzerland in an international friendly at the University of Tampa's Pepin-Rood Stadium in what was the United States' third-ever match in Florida. The Swiss opened the scoring early through reigning Swiss Footballer of the Year Heinz Hermann, much to the dismay of the 3,500 spectators in downtown Tampa.

The United States responded early in the second half through local favorite and Tampa Bay Rowdies legend Perry Van der Beck, who netted the equalizer in the first match of his U.S. Soccer Male Player of the Year-winning 1985 campaign with the national team. The goal was Van der Beck's second in as many matches for the national team and would ultimately be the final of his 23 caps.

United States 2 – 1 Finland (3/10/90)

The USMNT returned to Tampa in 1990, this time taking on Finland for the first—and so far, only time—in an international exhibition at the expansive Tampa Stadium, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Tampa Bay Rowdies, and known colloquially as ‘The Big Sombrero.' With a starting lineup featuring six future National Soccer Hall of Fame inductees, the United States relied on goals from Paul Caligiuri and Bruce Murray and a strong performance in goal from 20-year-old Kasey Keller to defeat Finland 2-1 and claim its first victory against a European opponent since 1980. The win marked Keller's first victory as a starter for the USMNT.

United States 3 – 1 Ecuador (3/25/07)

Following a 12-year hiatus, the USMNT returned to Tampa and hosted Ecuador in the former's first match at Raymond James Stadium. Sandwiched between the 2006 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Concacaf Gold Cup, the United States hosted a quintet of friendly tune-ups highlighted by matches against Denmark, Mexico and Ecuador—all ranked in the top 25 of the FIFA World Ranking at the time—to start the year.

A 25-year-old Landon Donovan, now the United States' joint-all-time leading scorer, got things going just 35 second into the contest, smashing in a feeble Ecuador clearance from the top of the box, bringing the crowd of over 30,000 to its feet before many of them could take their seats. It took Donovan just over an hour to bag the second hat trick of his decorated senior national team career, helping the United States defeat Ecuador 3-1 and hand La Tri its first loss since its record Round of 16 performance at the 2006 World Cup.

United States 2 – 1 El Salvador (2/24/10)

After a scoreless first half at Raymond James Stadium against Concacaf foe El Salvador in an international friendly, La Selecta's Rudis Corrales broke the deadlock in the 59th minute for the visitors. The Salvadoran elation would be short lived, though, as Brian Ching orchestrated an epic 15-minute comeback with a goal in the 75th minute and an assist on Sacha Kljestan's winner in the second minute of second-half stoppage time. The comeback victory in front of over 21,000 ensured the United States' unbeaten streak against El Salvador was extended to an incredible 15 consecutive matches.

United States 3 – 1 Antigua and Barbuda (6/8/12) | FIFA World Cup Qualifiers

The USMNT kicked off its ultra-successful 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign with a 3-1 victory against Antigua and Barbuda on a rainy evening at Raymond James Stadium—the first competitive victory of Jürgen Klinsmann's tenure as USMNT head coach. Through goals from Carlos Bocanegra, Clint Dempsey and Herculez Gomez, the United States knocked off Antigua and Barbuda in front of nearly 25,000 in the pair's first-ever meeting.

United States 3 – 2 Martinique (7/12/2017) | Concacaf Gold Cup



En route to its fifth Concacaf Gold Cup crown in 15 years, the USMNT earned the first victory of its unbeaten 2017 Gold Cup campaign with a 3-2 win against Martinique at Raymond James Stadium. Though Les Matinino successfully erased a two-goal deficit via Kévin Parsemain's nine-minute, second-half brace, Jordan Morris came through with a late winner for the hosts to complete the first brace of his senior national team career. Notably, the match saw a 22-year-old Cristian Roldan pick up his first of 42 caps; the midfielder will have a chance to earn his 43rd on Nov. 18 when the USMNT returns to Tampa to host World Cup-bound Uruguay.

United States 2 – 4 Colombia (10/11/18)

Though the United States suffered a 4-2 loss against Colombia in the former's most recent match in Tampa, the international friendly at Raymond James was notable for several reasons. The early October contest against the CONMEBOL power marked the highest-ranked opponent to face the USMNT in Tampa (No. 14 in the FIFA World Ranking), subsequently drawing a Tampa-record crowd of 38,631. Additionally, Palm Harbor, Fla. native and University of South Florida product Ben Sweat earned his first cap as a second-half substitute.","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

Cup Countdown

TAMPA — It was 10 months ago that JT Batson sat onstage at the United Soccer Coaches convention and laid out his ambitious vision for U.S. men's national team games ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

“We want to play in the biggest stadiums possible, in front of the most people possible, full stop,” Batson, U.S. Soccer's CEO, said.

“Our national team events should be huge events,” he continued. “They should be parties, they should be celebrations of soccer, and they should be something that everybody looks forward to.”

In many other countries, they are all of that. With the men's World Cup coming here, the thinking went, and buzz presumably building, USMNT matches could pack NFL stadiums. They could, at least temporarily, be marquee occasions.

But it hasn't happened. At least not yet. The USMNT's second-to-last game of 2025, against Paraguay on Saturday outside Philadelphia, failed to fill the 18,500-seat Subaru Park (despite the best efforts of thousands of exuberant Paraguay fans).

Instead, it seemingly prompted Mauricio Pochettino, the USMNT's Argentine coach, to make yet another plea for supporters.

“We need our fans [to] follow and support the national team. And we need to build that relationship,” Pochettino said, tangentially, at his post-match news conference. “Our fans need to be fans of USA men's national team, and to follow our crest, our flag, our colors. That is the most important.

“In Argentina, Argentina is more important than any name. In Brazil, the same. In England, the same. In Spain, the same,” he continued. “In every single country, in Paraguay, it's the same. … Who is the hero? The team. The team need to be their hero.”

Why hasn't this happened in the U.S.? The reasons are deep, complicated and debatable. Many of them are broad, cultural, long-standing and irreversible, far beyond Pochettino's scope. Soccer's development, of course, was delayed and backwards here in the States compared to other countries. U.S. national team games became expensive and overly commercialized before they became unmissable events that the average sports fan — or even the average soccer fan — felt a connection to.

The hope was that a looming World Cup would fuel connection. Excitement and patriotism would bring people in as the tournament approached. U.S. Soccer's goal, from a business and sporting perspective, was to replicate World Cup environments in the two dozen games it organized between the 2022 and 2026 World Cups.

“Ideally, we're playing a high-profile opponent in big stadiums, because that's what the World Cup's gonna be,” then-coach Gregg Berhalter said in February 2024. “That's our ideal. That's our No. 1 filter. How do we play the best possible opponent in the biggest possible stadium?”

But they simply haven't done that. In 2025, their games at NFL stadiums have been either full of Mexico fans or more than half empty. Their friendlies have all been at MLS grounds or, in one case, a 36,000-seat college football stadium.

They haven't done it, in part, because the best possible opponents haven't been available. European and South American giants were often competing in the UEFA Nations League or World Cup qualifiers while U.S. Soccer was searching for opponents to fill the vacuum created by automatic qualification.

And the games that were organized haven't gone to NFL stadiums because the USMNT, on its own and without much to play for until 2026, hasn't inspired the excitement necessary to fill those stadiums — or even come close.

In 2023, the program was on the rise. In 2024, over three Copa América games, it drew 162,478 fans to NFL stadiums. But the Americans crashed out of that tournament, and momentum stalled. Arguably, it reversed and became disillusionment. U.S. Soccer's hiring of Pochettino caught the attention of soccer fans, but it didn't change the popular narrative. It didn't make the team more likable. It didn't bring many new fans in.

Then, after the U.S. lost to Panama and Canada in March, and after a B-plus squad met relatively low expectations at the Gold Cup this summer, apathy seemed to set in.

Over the past two months, the USMNT has begun to inspire some optimism. With three wins and a draw in its last four games, all against 2026 World Cup participants, the outlook has improved. This was the context for Pochettino's Saturday plea. “We are happy. We need to keep going,” he said. “Because we need to improve, improve, improve, and arrive to the World Cup in our peak.” And the fans, he argued, could be a part of that.

“If we are capable [of attracting] our fans, and [they] support us, I think we can create a very good building between the fans and us, and arrive to the World Cup very, very strong,” Pochettino said. “Because our players need the support of the fans. They need the energy from the fans. And that is an important thing, that is my message to our fans — keep pushing, believe in the national team.”

The hope is that the tide of support begins to rise in March, when the U.S. will play Portugal and likely Belgium — as long as Belgium beats Liechtenstein on Tuesday to qualify for the World Cup and avoid a European playoff.

There will then be two friendlies in late May and early June, sendoff games before the USMNT sets up its World Cup camp at the University of California, Irvine, an hour southeast of Los Angeles. By then, surely, NFL stadiums will fill.

But for now, there are only friendlies between depleted squads, with no stakes or World Cup implications, just as there has been for the better part of the past three years.

So, the buzz remains muted. Tuesday's match against Uruguay here at Raymond James Stadium, the first USMNT friendly at an NFL stadium since June of 2024, will probably bring more of the same. Upper-deck tickets are not being sold, according to Ticketmaster, and although there are advertisements at Tampa International Airport and elsewhere around town, plenty of lower-bowl tickets remain available.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Player Ratings: USMNT 2","https://phillysoccerpage.net/2025/11/17/player-ratings-usmnt-2-1-paraguay/comment-page-1/","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:55:26 GMT","

The United States men's national team had a winning return to Subaru Park for the first time in almost eight years in one of Mauricio Pochettino's final tune-up games before the World Cup. A heavily rotated US side showed some of the attacking verve and fighting spirit fans have been begging for in a 2-1 victory over Paraguay. Let's get to the ratings.

Player Ratings:

Matt Freese – 6

The Union alum had little to do on the night, with two relatively simple saves in the second half. Not much he could have done about the goal.

Sergiño Dest – 6.5

A solid outing from Dest, who showed his typical flair going forward, but was unable to turn any of it into end product.

Joe Scally – 5.5

Scally looked a bit uncomfortable in the hybrid center-back/right-back role he was asked to fill. Misjudged the long ball that let Miguel Almiron in behind for Paraguay's goal, and had a few shaky moments in possession.

Miles Robinson – 5.5

Kept Almiron onside, then lost track of Alex Arce for the goal. Was otherwise solid defensively.

Tim Ream – 7

Calm and assured at the back, and the most likely of the center-backs to pick a pass through midfield.

Max Arfsten – 7.5

Lovely play and cross for the assist on the USMNT's opening goal. On that play, and throughout the night, Arfsten showed his valuable ability to create space from the defender on the dribble.

Cristian Roldan – 7

Roldan's national team renaissance continued, as the Seattle mifielder calmly kept things moving at the base of midfield, and was involved in the buildup to both US goals.

Tanner Tessmann – 7

The Lyon midfielder was integral in progressing the ball through midfield and showed some good attacking ideas, although not all of them came off as planned. Still, it was a promising performance from Tessmann as he looks to cement his place in the team heading into the World Cup.

Brenden Aaronson – 6

A class Brenden Aaronson performance on the attacker's Philadelphia homecoming. Aaronson was always eager to get involved, be it on the ball or in the press, but could never find the final pass or shot he needed.

Gio Reyna – 7.5

On his return to the national team, the much-discussed Gio Reyna notched a rare headed goal and set up the USA's second, while showing his usual array clever touches and passes throughout the night. An exciting performance, but now let's see if he can build on it.

Folarin Balogun – 7

A quiet night for Balogun, but he took his goal well, and ultimately that's all you can ask of your strikers.

Substitutes: 

(67') Diego Luna – 6.5

Luna was active after he came on; his pressure helped set up Balogun's goal, and he set up the Pepi chance in the 79'.

(67') Alex Freeman – 7

A solid performance from Freeman, who gets extra points for taking a few lumps during the late-game scrum.

(75') Tim Tillman – 6

Helped set up the late Pepi chance, but was otherwise not very involved.

(75') Ricardo Pepi – 5

Oof. Really, really should have scored on an open net in the 79'.

(75') Aidan Morris – 5

A couple of rough moments for Morris, including a late nutmeg on the endline that nearly led to an Arfsten own goal.

(80') Sebastian Berhalter – 7

Full marks for jumping wholeheartedly into the scrum at his teammate's defense.

Player of the Match: Max Arfsten

Arfsten has his doubters, but he has improved immensely for the national team over the past six months, to the point where he now looks like a viable option at left wingback for the World Cup. That might be crucial for the team, given Antonee Robinson's continuing struggle with injury.

How do you rate Luna 6.5 when he should have had the assist (Pepi choked), and probably a goal if they didn't foul him out of his boot, when you give Berhalter a 7 just for brawling??? He was involved in the play of the game as well. Come on my guy, what game were you watching?

PHOENIX, Ariz. (Nov. 16, 2025) – The U.S. Power Soccer National Team utilized braces from Riley Johnson, Lexi Heer, single strikes from Jordan Dickey and Michael Rayton and a trio of assists from Pete Winslow to earn a dominant 6-0 win against Mexico in the opening match of the 2025 APFC America's Cup at Ability360 on Sunday. The USA continues the qualifying tournament for the 2026 FIPFA Powerchair Football World Cup on Monday against Argentina (9 a.m. MT / 11 a.m. ET) and Uruguay (1:30 p.m. MT / 3:30 p.m. ET), with both matches to be shown live via the Power Soccer Shop YouTube channel.

Playing in front of a boisterous crowd, the tournament opener also marked the first ever match between the USA and Mexico in international power soccer and Tracy Mayer's side made sure to put its stamp on the match from the first whistle. 

It took the USA just two minutes to get on the board. Pete Winslow (pictured below), who earned the dead ball opportunity seconds earlier, used Riley Johnson as a decoy on his corner kick from the right and fired a cross that found Jordan Dickey stealthily sneaking through the box to poke it home at the back post. 





The USA dominated in the first half, keeping possession in the attacking half for almost the entirety of the first frame, leading to another good opportunity in the 10th minute. Winslow carried the ball on the right and pushed back for Johnson who tapped to the back post for Dickey, but his effort was saved off the line by Mexico captain Rubén Sánchez. 

A second goal came again from a Winslow set piece taken from the right corner. This time the Mailman coolly delivered a pass to Johnson who streaked in at the right, redirecting the ball off a Mexico defender and past goalkeeper Adrian Sánchez to give the U.S. a 2-0 lead in the 13th minute. 

Mayer's side continued to threaten from set pieces in the second half. After a two-on-one infraction from Mexico in the 25th minute, Winslow powered a cross to Dickey at the right post, but his first-time effort careened off the bar. 

After the close chance, the U.S. got a third goal two minutes later. Dickey crossed for Winslow at the left post, but saw his shot saved off the line before Johnson pounced on the rebound, bundling his second of the match over the line from close range. 

Mayer called on substitutes to continue the pressure, as 16-year-old Michael Rayton, who earned his international debut, and veteran Lexi Heer (pictured below) entered in the 28th minute. Heer nearly got a goal a minute later, re-directing Winslow's corner from the left off the near post, before her follow up attempt went just wide. 



That chance only spurred her on, as Heer expertly anticipated Winslow's corner from the right in the 31st minute, popping up in the box before slotting it between two Mexico defenders to make it 4-0.

Fellow substitute Rayton then ensured a dream debut by getting on the score sheet on a well-worked team goal in the 36th minute. After a two-on-one infraction, center David Dowling put the ball back in play just inside the Mexico half, playing to Heer on the right before centering for Rayton who hit home his first career goal, slicing an accurate shot between multiple defenders.

The USA put a stamp on the match in the 38th minute, as Dowling sent a corner kick from the right to Heer rolling through at the left post. While her initial attempt was saved, she followed through and put back the rebound to cap the USA's impressive 6-0 victory.

Cup Countdown

 Azael Rodriguez / Getty Images

After the U.S. men's national team defeated Paraguay 2-1 Saturday night, another matchup between Concacaf and CONMEBOL teams took place considerably further away, in Torreón, Mexico. Uruguay, the U.S.'s next opponent Tuesday night in Tampa, Fla., traveled to the desert-like city to face Mexico, one of the three 2026 World Cup co-hosts.

The hot and humid temperatures matched the aggressive nature that both sides displayed during a friendly that nearly reached a boiling point – and issued a warning for any U.S. players expecting anything less than an intense 90 minutes ahead. Within five minutes, the game's first studs-up challenge took place. Mexican players Hirving Lozano and Marcel Ruíz both led with their boots high as Uruguayan winger Brian Rodríguez slid in to play the ball.

Lozano's reckless vigor was duly noted by the Uruguayans. Shortly after the tackle took place, Lozano received a pass on his left wing in a favorable attacking position. One quick body feint wrong-footed Uruguay fullback Guillermo Varela, who then intentionally used his knee as a battering ram to take Lozano out. Minutes later, Lozano angrily used his own right knee to jab Uruguay's Rodrigo Zalazar's thigh.

Mexico captain Edson Álvarez raked his right cleat over the top of Mathias Olivera's right foot, in an attempt to win the ball and to let Olivera know his intentions in midfield. In the second half, Uruguay central defender José María Giménez, who wore the captain's armband in Federico Valverde's absence, left his defensive position to race up the field and deliver an elbow to the back of the neck of Mexico midfielder Orbelin Pineda. Giménez calmly accepted the yellow card.

It didn't stop there. In the 58th minute, Uruguayan fullback Nahitan Nandez, a notoriously combative defender, used his studs to spike the back of the leg of Mexico's 17-year-old phenom Gilberto Mora. It was an obvious red card-level offense that Panamanian referee Fernando Javier Morón merely cautioned with a yellow. When Nandez realized he had gotten away with it, he approached Mora to apologize, who was on the ground writhing in pain. But Nandez's tap on Mora's shoulder showed little remorse for the violent tackle.

Mexico's bench spilled out onto the field in the 87th minute after Mexico defender Cesar Montes and Uruguay attacker Maximiliano Araujo tangled on the ground after a would-be penalty in Uruguay's box went uncalled. Montes and Araujo flailed their arms at each other and stood forehead-to-forehead as the game's temperature rose.

The match would end scoreless – and even on the fouls count as well, with 19 apiece – with Mexico jeered off the pitch. The Uruguayan press chastised their national team for its failures to produce any semblance of attacking football, and for resorting to physical play to chop up Mexico's sustained possession. Neither Mexico nor Uruguay can claim innocence on the night. Both teams toed the line with fouls that were clear yellow card warnings, and a few that could've resulted in a sending off.

The result will likely soon be forgotten as countries from around the world prepare for next summer's 48-team World Cup. But for both Mexico and Uruguay, valuable lessons were learned. Mexico, winless in its last five matches under Javier Aguirre, played with intensity and showed a willingness to suffocate the opposition's build-up play. Uruguay will rue yet another match without a goal. The South Americans have failed to score in nine of their last 15 games.

Head coach Marcelo Bielsa blamed himself but said that he was surprised by his side's overall performance. “I expected more than Uruguay and less from Mexico,” he said.

Uruguay is still a very gritty team whose mind games, or dark arts, are amongst the most cunning in world football. But on Saturday, Mexico poked the bear intentionally with a relentless high press and hard challenges, particularly in the middle of the field. Mexico was at home and were quick to send a message that a night in Torreón would be anything but pleasant. That's precisely the takeaway that U.S. head coach Mauricio Pochettino will share with his players. It'll be something that the Argentine will have no problem emphasizing. The two countries will face off in a rematch of the group stage match that eliminated the U.S. from the 2024 Copa América. Prior to that 1-0 Uruguay win, the fighting spirit of that U.S. team under Gregg Berhalter had been questioned.

The U.S., despite matching Uruguay's intensity that day, ultimately succumbed to a dead-ball goal in the 68th minute. From there, Uruguay defended its clean sheet like the sovereignty of the tiny nation depended on it. Uruguay remains very sound defensively and is still one of game's great underdog stories.

La Celeste represent a country of roughly 3.5 million people that for decades has produced thick-skinned football heroes and trophy-laden national teams. Today, their striker room lacks the star power of the past when Luis Suárez, Diego Forlán and Edinson Cavani starred internationally. Former Liverpool striker Darwin Nuñez, now with Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal, is not in this camp due to a knee injury. That has forced Bielsa to rely on 31-year-old Rodrigo Aguirre at the lone No. 9 position.

Pochettino played under Bielsa as a no-holds-barred center back at Newell's in the early 1990s and made of all his 20 Argentina appearances under the coach, also playing under him at Espanyol in La Liga. The young defender was the enforcer on those Bielsa-led teams during a time when South American football was more physical than it was tactical. Pochettino has spent many hours as U.S. head coach trying to gradually instill some of the passion that he identifies with as an Argentine on this U.S. team that began his tenure with a clear personality.

After the win over Paraguay, some U.S. players revealed that an antagonistic attitude is encouraged by their head coach, especially against opposition that may seek a psychological advantage.

“Pochettino always tells us to fight, fight, fight. I think we embody that,” said U.S. defender Max Arfsten on Saturday. “These games are gritty and physical, I think this plays into our identity.”

The match, of course, was marred by a late-game skirmish between both benches. Pochettino found himself on the floor during the melee. “That situation is very, very dangerous,” Pochettino said after the match. “Anything can happen, I don't like this type of situation.”

Fans and American pundits cheered the reaction by the U.S. players as a sign that the team's culture is improving. U.S. goalkeeper Matt Freese accused the Paraguayans of delivering “a few cheap shots.” U.S. captain Tim Ream said, “It shows that guys are in it, willing to protect each other, wanting to get involved.” He added that not getting “pushed around” was an objective against a typically tough-tackling Paraguay team.

Perhaps the need to shatter the cultural stereotypes that diminish U.S. soccer around the globe is a measuring stick that Pochettino's players have taken to heart. On Tuesday in Florida, that newfound U.S. bravado will clash against the famed garra charrúa of Uruguay.

Uruguay is a team that is desperate for a positive result. Bielsa expects better from his men and will certainly retool his starting XI with the inclusion of a few first-team players who sat out against Mexico. Bielsa said on Saturday night that Uruguay's less-than-convincing performance wasn't due to a lack of preparation or effort.

He blamed his approach and pre-match vision for the Mexico match. Even though his ideas have been fully embraced by the current squad, Bielsa said they're still chasing the ideal style of play. By shielding his players, Bielsa sought to maintain their natural fighting spirit intact for Tuesday's date against the U.S.

Pochettino's men will have to be careful to not let their emotions spill over, or at the very least, refrain from any more bench-clearing tussles in the name of machismo.

“I think we're one big family, we're playing at home, so we're not going to take anything,” Miles Robinson told reporters on Saturday night. “We came out, we're trying to fight for each other, we're trying to fight for our country, and obviously we came out, we got the W, and that's what means the most to us.”

In a World Cup setting, patriotism and heart can be difference makers, but when passion is mistaken for belligerence, the consequences can be severe. Tuesday's friendly will be a test of wills for the U.S. and Uruguay in a friendly that will be anything but a cordial dress rehearsal.

World Cup

 Charles McQuillan/Getty Images

The United States Soccer Federation and the Portuguese Football Federation will soon confirm an exhibition match between their men's teams to take place at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta in March 2026.

The game is agreed and signed off after Portugal sealed qualification for next summer's World Cup by beating Armenia 9-1 on Sunday, meaning Roberto Martinez's side topped Group F in a four-team group which also included the Republic of Ireland and Hungary. It remains subject only to public confirmation, according to multiple people familiar with the conversation, who wished to remain anonymous ahead of an announcement.

The Athletic first revealed the game was under discussions in September but this fixture, along with a further friendly against Belgium (also scheduled for March), remained subject to final agreements being made and both Portugal and Belgium qualifying for the World Cup and avoiding the play-offs.

The Portugal match is also significant because it will bring an end to an almost 12-year absence for Cristiano Ronaldo from playing soccer in the United States.

He last played in the U.S. on August 2, 2014, when he came on as a substitute for Real Madrid against Manchester United in front of a crowd of 109,318 at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor. He last played for Portugal in the U.S. earlier that summer in a friendly game against the Republic of Ireland at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Ronaldo's absence in the U.S. has been magnified since 2017 when the German newspaper Der Spiegel revealed details of an alleged sexual assault involving Ronaldo and the model Kathryn Mayorga during a holiday in Las Vegas in 2009 — always strenuously denied by Ronaldo and for which charges have never been brought. Ronaldo has not been publicly photographed in the U.S. He has also not been part of any pre-season or exhibition matches in the country since then, whether playing for Real Madrid, Juventus, Manchester United or his current club Al Nassr. He did have preliminary discussions in late 2022 over a possible move to MLS' Sporting Kansas City but went to Saudi Arabia instead.

In recent months, Ronaldo has also been part of diplomatic efforts to woo the U.S. President Donald Trump. In July, the European Council president Antonio Costa (himself Portuguese), gave the U.S. President a Portugal jersey signed by Ronaldo during a Group Seven summit in Canada. It was a No. 7 jersey, signed by Ronaldo, which read: “To president Donald J. Trump, Playing for Peace.”

In a recent interview with Piers Morgan, Ronaldo said he wished to meet President Trump to discuss world peace. “He is one of the guys who can help to change the world. One of the most important guys is the U.S. President. If we can help each other to make this happen…I swear I cannot watch TV. Sometimes I start to see the news and I cannot… He is one of the guys I wish to meet to sit and have a nice talk. If it is here, or in the U.S., wherever he wants, I know he was here in Saudi with our boss (Crown Prince) MBS (Mohammed bin Salman). I wish one day to meet him because he is one of the guys who can make things happen and I like people like that.”

For the USMNT, the game will form a big part of their World Cup preparations as coach Mauricio Pochettino takes on the fifth highest ranked team in the world in Portugal, while Belgium are ranked 8th. The USMNT have played recent exhibitions against South American teams Ecuador and Paraguay, as well as teams from the Asian confederation in Japan, South Korea and Australia. Match-ups against major European nations will likely prove an even stiffer test as Pochettino's seeks to finalize his line-up and squad ahead of the home World Cup.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Six reasons why Erling Haaland-inspired Norway are serious dark horses for 2026 World Cup glory","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/erling-haaland-inspired-norway-serious-dark-horses-2026-world-cup/blt02290b2e9f88a90c","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

In an interview with Time Magazine published at the end of July, Erling Haaland claimed that Norway would only have a 0.5 percent chance of winning the 2026 World Cup. He added: “If we would qualify for the World Cup, it would be like another big nation winning it. It would be the biggest party ever. Scenes in Oslo would be incredible.” That party is now underway, with Norway having booked their spot at the tournament for the first time in 28 years after thumping 4-1 wins over Estonia and Italy during the November international break.

The latter of those victories, recorded at a packed-out San Siro, was particularly impressive. Italy deservedly led at the interval through a clever finish from Francesco Pio Esposito, but Norway exploded into life in the second half and put on an attacking football clinic to blow the hosts away, with Antonio Nusa and Jorgen Strand Larsen scoring either side of a Haaland brace.

It must be noted that Italy are no longer the force of old, but steady improvements have been made under new boss Gennaro Gattuso, and five members of their Euro 2020-winning squad -  Gianluigi Donnarumma, Nicolo Barella, Giovanni Di Lorenzo, Alessandro Bastoni and Manuel Locatelli - started the match. Norway are just the second team to ever beat Italy in a competitive away game by three goals or more; Sweden were the last to achieve that feat way back in 1983.

They also exacted revenge over Italy for their round of 16 defeat at the 1998 World Cup finals. Statement results don't come much bigger, and you'd have to imagine that Haaland is now revising his expectations for next summer. 

The Manchester City talisman is leading a golden generation of talent that should fear no one. All the evidence from a stunning qualification campaign points to one undeniable truth: Norway are serious dark horses for World Cup glory, and not just because they can call upon the best striker in the business...

Haaland's presence is the main factor, though. Norway won all eight of their games in Group I, scoring 37 goals, and Haaland bagged 16 of them, equalling Robert Lewandowski's single qualifying campaign record. 

The irrepressible City terminator has already notched 32 goals for club and country this season, and his double against Italy brought him up to 55 in just 48 appearances at international level, 22 more than any other Norway player in history. Haaland has found the net in nine consecutive games for his country, and in eight of his last nine Premier League outings for City. Norwegian journalist Lars Sivertsen has described Haaland as the nation's ""greatest ever player"", ahead of icons like Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, John Arne Riise, and Tore Andre Flo, which feels totally justified.

Amazingly, at the age of 25, Haaland has not even entered his prime yet. No other team at the World Cup will boast such a deadly weapon: a quick, strong, deceptively skilful and frighteningly ruthless centre-forward who doesn't seem to feel pressure.

But he will also benefit from a stellar supporting cast. Atletico Madrid's Alexander Sorloth has been the perfect foil for Haaland as an imposing target man, while Wolves marksman Strand Larsen has emerged as the ideal impact substitute. As Italy learned to their peril, Norway have enough firepower to go toe-to-toe with any opponent.

Remarkably, Norway managed to seal their spot at the World Cup without their prized playmaker and captain, Martin Odegaard. The Arsenal midfielder missed his country's final three qualifiers due to a knee injury, and Solbakken has confirmed he is still ""some distance"" from a return to the pitch.

But time is on Odegaard's side, and Norway need him to unlock their full potential. In tighter games, he is the one who can sprinkle the magic required to open things up, as he did when setting up three goals in Norway's 4-2 win away in Israel in March.

Odegaard produced seven assists overall, more than any other player in European qualifying. Like Haaland, he is a world-class operator built for the big stage. The 26-year-old also demonstrated his commitment and leadership credentials by flying out for the latest Norway camp and joining their celebrations instead of focusing only on his recovery at Arsenal's training base.

""He was there before, during and after,"" Solbakken said after the win over Estonia. ""There is always an aura with Martin."" Norway team-mate Morten Thorsby added: ""Martin is our captain. He gives us security and strength. We wanted him with us. Even though he couldn't help us on the pitch, he did off the pitch.""

Odegaard leads by example in everything he does, and Norway fans will be praying that the former Real Madrid starlet returns to full fitness sooner rather than later, because he is the key to a deep World Cup run.

With an average age of just 25.8 years, Norway possess one of the most exciting young squads in the international game. Haaland and Odegaard have shared most of the plaudits in recent years, but there is every chance that, by the time the World Cup kicks off, the spotlight will extend to fit in two hugely talented up-and-comers: Nusa and Oscar Bobb.

Nusa, who has been catching the eye in the Bundesliga with his exploits on the left wing for RB Leipzig, has racked up 16 goal involvements in 20 games for Norway since making his debut in 2023. There is still scope for the 20-year-old to improve his decision-making, but he gives defenders nightmares with his explosive turn of pace and magnetic footwork, which have also been vital to Norway's emergence as an effective counter-attacking side.

On the opposite flank, Bobb has not been quite as influential, but he offers something different. The Manchester City ace does most of his best work when coming inside, and is happier to link the play rather than be a difference-maker in the final third. Bobb, 22, is more of a technician than Nusa; he excels at finding space between the lines and picking out incisive passes. 

Nusa gives Norway an X-factor, while Bobb has the footballing IQ to help draw opponents out of position. They could be an effective combination in North America, while former Nordsjælland wonderkid Andreas Schjelderup is another option in advanced areas. Struggles for form at Benfica and off-field controversy have halted the 21-year-old's career trajectory over the last year or so, but he is also a gifted footballer who is versatile enough to play on the wing or as an attacking midfielder.

Norway's rise can at least partly be attributed to the vast Premier League experience in their dressing room. In addition to Haaland, Odegaard, Strand Larsen and Bobb, Solbakken has also utilised the qualities of Sander Berge (Fulham), Kristoffer Ajer (Brentford) and David Moller Wolfe (Wolves) to take Norway to the next level.

With so many players used to the intensity of life in Europe's most demanding league, Solbakken has genuine strength in depth. There is an unsung hero in that group who deserves far more credit, though.

Berge was arguably Norway's most consistent performer in qualifying. The Fulham midfielder's ability to break up play initially gave them the platform for success, and after Odegaard was ruled out, he also became the man to drive the team forward.

""He's taken a huge step forward at Fulham. We've been able to tailor-make a role for him in the national team that really suits his strengths,"" Solbakken has told ESPN.

Berge has been Norway's chief disruptor and architect in the No.8 slot, setting the tone for the rest of the squad with his work rate. When Berge is playing alongside Odegaard and Bodo/Glimt's Patrick Berg, Norway have the perfect blend of physicality and creativity in the middle of the park. The former Sheffield United and Burnley star is now living up to the promise he showed in his younger years, and Norway are a much braver side in attack and defence because of him.

Indeed, Berge and Berg have run themselves into the ground to make sure Norway's defence is never exposed. But the backline itself has also been rock solid, with Brentford's Ajer and Bologna's Torbjorn Heggem developing a telepathic relationship at centre-half.

They are both towering, ball-playing defenders who can snuff out any danger in the air and kick-start attacks. It's a near-impossible task to beat either of them in a physical battle, while Wolfe and Borussia Dortmund's Julian Ryerson bring high energy in the full-back positions. 

Orjan Nylan, meanwhile, has been the definition of reliable between the sticks. The Sevilla goalkeeper only conceded five goals across Norway's eight qualifying games, commanding his box with genuine authority while showing off remarkable reflexes for a man standing at 6'4"".

There is no weak link in defence for opposing teams to target. In fact, Norway don't really have any weak spots, but that is a much to do with Solbakken's tactics as it is personnel. 

Israel manager Ran Ben-Shimon heaped praise on Norway after seeing his side suffer a 5-0 defeat to Solbakken's men in October. ""I believe that Norway are one of the top two teams in Europe, together with Spain,"" Ben-Shimon declared. ""I expected a lot, but they still surprised me.""

Solbakken described that lofty claim as ""a bit of a stretch"", but it doesn't feel like it. England, France, Portugal and Croatia have also secured passage to the World Cup, but none have impressed more than Norway. Euro 2024 winners Spain, who only need a draw against Turkey on Monday to qualify, still look like the top dogs, but Norway have a genuine claim to being second-best on the continent right now. 

Although he is staying modest, Solbakken has built a special team that should be taken seriously by cultivating a close-knit atmosphere in the dressing room and stamping a clear style of play. Norway used to leak goals when playing a man-for-man system, but Solbakken has replaced that with a zonal defensive structure that places an emphasis on capitalising quickly on interceptions.

Norway also now keep the ball far better, inviting teams onto them so they can play through the press and make the most of their speed and power upfront. ""We are a combination of physical strength and technique,"" Solbakken said after Sunday's win against Italy. The former Wolves boss has transformed Norway into a front-foot side that can defend with the ball - a hallmark of a top-class outfit.

It remains to be seen if they can keep this level up in the United States, Canada and Mexico, where temperatures and pressure will skyrocket. But if Norway get through the group stage unfazed, all the so-called elite nations will want to avoid them in the knockouts. Haaland should dare to dream.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

There was plenty to cheer for stars of the Roshn Saudi League the past few days, with Yassine Bono shortlisted for CAF Goalkeeper of the Year and Cristiano Ronaldo headlining a large Portugal contingent booking a place at next year's 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Al Hilal's Bono, the 2023-24 RSL Goalkeeper of the Year, was nominated for the prestigious continental award alongside fellow Moroccan Munir Mohamedi (RS Berkane) and South Africa No.1 Ronwen Williams (Mamelodi Sundowns).

Of course, Bono is bidding to become a two-time winner of the honour having previously won two years ago on his way to helping Al Hilal capture the RSL crown in record-breaking fashion.

Bono, Mendy, Koulibaly and Neves also recognised

The awards, which cover the period of January 6 to October 15, 2025, take place in Rabat on Wednesday. On Monday, the official CAF website provided the reasoning for Bono's nomination, no doubt impressed by his star performance during this summer's 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. 

“[Bono] has been a model of consistency for several years and was the same again in 2025 for Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal and the Morocco national team, who he helped to FIFA World Cup 2026 qualification,"" it wrote. ""He was named in the FIFA Club World Cup Best XI in 2025.”

While Bono had already secured a place at next summer's global finals, he was joined on Sunday night by Al Hilal teammates Ruben Neves and Joao Canelo.

Portugal defeated Armenia 9-1 in a huge statement of their title-winning intentions at the FIFA World Cup, the reigning UEFA Nations League champions even doing it without Ronaldo, with the Al Nassr captain suspended following a red card against the Republic of Ireland last week.

Nevertheless, Ronaldo wrote on social media platform X: “We're at the World Cup! Let's go, Portugal!”

Winner of the past two RSL golden boots, Ronaldo has kicked off the 2025-26 campaign seemingly determined to keep hold of his crown. His nine goals in eight matches places him second in the top-scorer charts, one behind club and international teammate Joao Felix.

Felix, who has taken the RSL by storm since his summer move from English Premier League side Chelsea, was a second-half substitute in Portugal's victory against Armenia. He created the assist for his team's ninth goal of the night.

Al Hilal's Neves was also introduced late on, while Canelo began the match as he continues to make his way back to full fitness following injury.

Joao Felix, current top scorer in 2025-26 RSL, helped Portugal book spot at 2026 FIFA World Cup

The Portuguese quartet will arrive at the 2026 FIFA World Cup together with some familiar names, including a trio of the RSL's French stars.

Al Ittihad's N'Golo Kante, Al Hilal's Theo Hernandez and Al Nassr's Kingsley Coman are regulars for the 2022 runners-up, who last Thursday confirmed qualification for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico with a 4-0 win at home to Ukraine.

Competing in his first game for France in almost a year, the evergreen Kante was named man of the match.

However, there was disappointment for Al Kholood and Nigeria captain William Troost-Ekong after the Super Eagles were beaten on penalties on Sunday by DR Congo in their play-off to reach the inter-confederation shootout in Mexico in March.

Ex-Real Madrid boss poised to become France boss after 2026 World Cup","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/zinedine-zidane-return-ex-real-madrid-boss-poised-to-become-france-boss-after-world-cup/blt18f3fcdaf5b14969","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 09:38:10 GMT","

Zinedine Zidane's long-awaited comeback to management is finally taking shape with France preparing to appoint the former Real Madrid boss as their next head coach after Didier Deschamps steps down following the 2026 World Cup. The move is poised to end months of speculation and ignite fresh excitement around Les Bleus, who have recently faced criticism for lacking innovation. 

Zidane's anticipated return to the sidelines may finally become reality. As reported by AS, France intend to appoint him as their next national team manager once Deschamps completes his final tournament at the 2026 World Cup. For months Zidane has hinted that he is ready to coach again, and France have been waiting for the right moment to bring him home.

The timing aligns with France's need for renewal. Critics have increasingly lamented Deschamps' recent handling of the squad, arguing that his approach has turned predictable, conservative and overly dependent on earlier experiments. Many felt the team had stopped evolving in key areas such as tactical flexibility, attacking variety and squad rotation.

Zidane's arrival is therefore viewed as a chance to inject new flavour into a team rich with talent but in need of a fresh tactical lens. 

Deschamps' contract is nearing its end, closing a monumental chapter in French football. Appointed in 2012 after Laurent Blanc, Deschamps took France to heights that cemented his legacy. He guided the nation to the Euro 2016 final, delivered World Cup glory in 2018, reached another World Cup final in 2022, and maintained consistent competitiveness throughout more than a decade in charge.

But his reign was not without low points. The round-of-16 exit at Euro 2020, tactical rigidity at times, selection decisions that raised eyebrows, and an increasingly repetitive approach left the impression that France were not fully maximising their extraordinary talent pool. 

Recent years have seen a growing consensus among critics: France under Deschamps had become predictable. Analysts repeatedly pointed to the same issues — conservative game plans, slow in-game adjustments, and a reliance on ideas that once worked but no longer fit a squad bursting with dynamic, attack-minded talent. In several matches, France looked like a team playing within themselves, constrained rather than liberated.

Commentators argued that even with Kylian Mbappe, and emerging talents like Eduardo Camavinga and Warren Zaire-Emery, France often played with unnecessary caution, absorbing pressure instead of dictating games.

That is where Zidane's profile stands in sharp contrast, as he won three Champions League titles in three seasons and a La Liga crown in Madrid.

Even with the excitement surrounding Zidane's expected arrival, France will deeply miss Deschamps. France will miss the unique personal bond Deschamps built inside the dressing room, a connection rooted in trust, continuity, and genuine care for his players. He wasn't just a tactician; he was a stabilising force who understood how to manage personalities across generations. His reliance on experienced leaders like Hugo Lloris created a mentoring culture that helped young players settle quickly under the pressure of international football.

The midfielder reminded the world of what he brings, taking a big step forward as the clock ticks towards next summer's big tournament

CHESTER, Pa. - Gio Reyna insisted he didn't remember what he shouted into the camera after scoring his early goal on Saturday against Paraguay in a 2-1 win for the USMNT. Later, he admitted he did - he just didn't want to repeat it.

No matter. His celebration made it clear: he's back

""I was just happy to score,"" Reyna said after scoring one and setting up another in the USMNT's 2-1 win. ""Just happy to be back.""

After all this time, Reyna offered reminders of the player he can still be. He delivered a big goal - something that has long been his calling card - and found ways to influence the game throughout. And he remained, as always, at the center of attention when he pulls on a USMNT shirt, for better or worse.

His teammates, though, insist this is a new version of Reyna - a bit smarter and a bit more mature. Whether this Reyna can help lead the USMNT into a World Cup is the lingering question. Even after his goal, the debates around him haven't faded; if anything, they've only grown sharper.

""I feel really good,"" Reyna said. ""I feel valued, feel important, feel ready to go. Obviously, when you feel better mentally, you can definitely play better on the field, too. So yeah, I'm definitely building up, but I feel great. I'm just happy, but I have to keep working now.""

After the match, Reyna acknowledged that, despite a Man of the Match-level performance, he's still not quite himself.

Following several rollercoaster years and an early-season injury that delayed his start at new club Borussia Mönchengladbach, the midfielder is still finding his footing.

""Probably 80-85 percent,"" Reyna said when asked about his fitness levels. ""It's hard to say when [I'll be 100 percent], but I'm not far. I'm definitely getting there. I feel really good.""

If this was 80-85 percent, then Reyna is on a good path. 

It took less than four minutes for him to make his mark. After seeing Max Arfsten break through on the right side, Reyna found himself in position to head home the Columbus Crew wingback's perfectly-weighted cross. Reyna made no mistake, smashing the ball off the underside of the bar and in for his first USMNT goal since netting in the Nations League final in March 2024.

""I always had confidence in myself,"" Reyna said. ""To see a goal going into the back of the net, it's always nice. I just want to stay in dangerous areas and continue to work.""

Then, with the match level in the second half, Reyna popped up again, playing a ball across the box and into danger. It banked off a defender and right to Folarin Balogun, who made no mistake. In the end, Reyna completed 39 of his 47 passes, created two chances, won two tackles, and had an interception. It was an emphatic performance from a player who clearly felt he needed one to impress USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

""I knew it was an opportunity for me to show him that I belong here,"" Reyna said after the match. ""He's been great with me all week. Working with him, it's just giving me the freedom and the confidence to sort of be myself. I can't thank him enough, obviously, for the start and just for the relationship that we've built this camp.""

The 23-year-old midfielder is, of course, still getting to know Pochettino. This is his second camp under the USMNT boss, with the only other one coming in that ill-fated March Nations League window. Reyna is a familiar face for most of the USMNT, though, and there is the sense that this go around does feel different for the midfielder.

Heading into camp, there were obvious questions about Reyna. He hadn't played meaningful USMNT minutes in over a year, and much of the work he did earlier in the cycle came with a cloud hanging over it. As long as former manager Gregg Berhalter was in charge, the tension stemming from the 2022 World Cup was always going to linger.

Now, with that finally behind everyone, Reyna can simply be himself - free of the weight of the past.

That said, there have been new struggles. Unable to crack the Borussia Dortmund XI over the last few years, largely due to injuries, Reyna swapped clubs this summer by moving to Borussia Monchengladbach. That move hasn't gotten off to a strong start, as another injury has limited him to just one appearance in the starting lineup so far this season.

""They've been fantastic with building me up to full fitness, and I'm slowly getting there, as you can see tonight,"" Reyna said. ""I definitely expect, when I get back, to start more matches.""

Those in the USMNT camp have already seen a change in him. Starting from the first training session, Reyna has had some extra pep in his step and some extra intensity in everything he does.

""He's not really let the challenges overseas seep into this camp, which is great to see,"" veteran defender Tim Ream said. ""I've had a few conversations with him, nothing crazy, but he's speaking up a lot more in training in terms of, 'Okay, I see this, what are you seeing?' He's getting really involved in the understanding of the movements and what we're doing in the build-up and the defensive shape. I feel like he's more tuned and more focused on the field than I've seen in the past, which is a great thing. I think his focus is so much greater now.""

That said, this wasn't a total reinvention. Reyna is still doing what he has always done for the USMNT: make an impact.

Following the game, Brenden Aaronson made a point to say it.

“He always shows up for the national team,” he said after starting next to Reyna as the USMNT's two attacking midfielders. ""He deserves it [the opportunity]. He's been through a lot with injuries, with all this stuff, but whenever he plays for the national team, he's always there, and it's awesome to see.”

Even after so long away, old relationships remain. Chief among them? Reyna's chemistry with Balogun, who has been one of Reyna's favorite teammates to play with since his own USMNT arrival in 2023. The two have combined to wreak havoc whenever they've been on the field together, dating back to a Reyna-to-Balogun assist all the way back in the 2023 Nations League final win over Canada.

""Gio wanted to come into this camp and do his thing and wanted to put the noise behind him, "" Balogun said. ""I feel like he did that today. It was a really strong performance in a difficult game. He got the goal early for us and helped create the second goal. I'm really happy for him, and it's a fantastic night for him.""

Reyna, for his part, was just happy to be back with the group. It has been a turbulent year for the U.S., prompting Pochettino to reset things after the March Nations League camp. The team rebuilt chemistry during the Gold Cup and carried it into the fall, producing a four-game unbeaten run with three wins.

""I definitely felt the energy and the collectiveness,"" Reyna said. ""The will to win games and the want to represent your country has been taken to the next level. Of course, there are tactical things that I try to adjust to and learn when I get in as quickly as possible, but we've had some camps that have not been as good, but, in the end, I've been with this team for the most part, and it's always really positive. 

""We're a group that loves to work together and play together, and we've had some success in the past, too. In the tough moments, I was never concerned for the team. It was just working the kinks out and taking things and learning and getting better.""

The time for getting better is running out, though. The World Cup is around the corner - will Reyna be a part of it?

Reyna says he doesn't think about the World Cup, at least not too often. Still, it's there, and it's coming soon. He, like all players, wants to be a part of it. He knows, though, that his path there has to begin with his club, not necessarily his national team.

""You try not to think about the national team every day,"" he said. ""Of course, it's important and I want to be here and I want to be at the World Cup and be an important player for the team, but I was just moreso trying to focus on my club situation and getting minutes there and really building up. I believe if I do my work there, then it'll fall into place here, too.""

Still, Saturday was a good start. Given an opportunity to impress Pochettino, he seized it, leaving the USMNT boss with plenty to praise following the 2-1 win.

""He scored and I think he did a very good job,"" Pochettino said. ""I am so happy with him, and he showed why he started. He confirmed that he's a player who needs to improve, because he needs to play more in his club, but we can see today that he was great. He scored, he assisted, and his capacity to read the game and find space between the lines, it was a nightmare for Paraguay. He did a very good job.""

He'll have to keep doing that. Competition will be fierce for the World Cup spot in that attacking midfield spot. Christian Pulisic and Malik Tillman seem like locks. Diego Luna, Brenden Aaronson, and Alejandro Zendejas will have something to say, too. You can add Weston McKennie into that mix as well, despite the Juventus star's absence from this camp.

The pressure is on Reyna, but then again, it almost always is. He answered that pressure with a goal on Saturday, which leads to the next question: now what?

""In the end, it's performances like this that can help everybody here,"" he said. ""I want to have, more importantly, seven or eight good months in the rest of the season with Gladbach, and then I believe if I keep performing like I did tonight, then I'll have a good chance to make the team and have an impact there too.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Former West Ham United player Don Hutchison has urged the club to sign Real Madrid star Endrick. The Brazilian is not receiving enough playing time under the new Los Blancos head coach, Xabi Alonso, and is looking for a new club in the upcoming January transfer window. Although he has a few suitors, West Ham are yet to establish themselves as a top option for the youngster, who has a few conditions before making a switch.

In 2024, Endrick was signed with a lot of hope by the Madrid board, as he shone bright in Brazil while featuring for Palmeiras. His first season, which was under Italian head coach Carlo Ancelotti, saw him register 37 appearances, scoring seven goals and providing an assist. However, ever since the start of the Xabi Alonso era this season, the Brazilian wonderkid has yet to find a place in the starting lineup, or even in the squad. As now now, he has managed only 11 minutes in La Liga, and is currently seeking a way out of the club to reclaim his firing form. While Alonso had claimed that he has faith on the 2006 born Brazilian, he is yet to give me a proper chance to shine. Moreover, the competition inside the squad has been immense, with Gonzalo Garcia climbing the pecking order after his sensational performances at the Club World Cup and Kylian Mbappe establishing himself as their most important goal-getter. 

It is estimated that Endrick is moving out of Madrid, but his destination is yet to be guaranteed. Amidst this, former West Ham player Hutchison has urged his former club to sign the 19-year-old. 

He told Sportscasting: ""Yeah, I think it would be a good move for West Ham to get Endrick if it's possible. He's a strong boy. You look at the physicality. He's stocky and he's strong. He needs to be given time, which is hard in the Premier League. He might be better off going to Sociedad like Isak or Odegaard did. Sometimes it pays to stay in La Liga, but you go and play every single week, building your strength, lungs and legs up. You get your confidence, goals and your mentality and bring it up that way. 

""Because what you wouldn't want to do is bring him to West Ham or a team in the Premier League that are in a relegation fight, where you haven't got time to play them every single game, because you might be losing games along the way. You haven't got time to bed these young kids in. So if I was Endrick, I'd be looking at a short-term move in La Liga to try and play every single week to then have the potential to either move to England or back to Real Madrid. That being said, it's a move that I would endorse for the Hammers.""

Signing Endrick would not be easy for West Ham, as the youngster has some conditions to fulfil in his procedure of selecting a new club. His first criterion is the weight of the league, and it has to be among the top ones in Europe. While he might consider the top clubs in Portugal, his preference is England, Spain, France, Italy, and Germany. Moreover, the club needs to be a participant in the continental competitions and a strong contender for the domestic league. Lastly, the team needs to have an attacking mindset so as to comply with Endrick's strengths. French outfit Lyon have emerged as a potential destination for the 19-year-old, ousting Manchester United's approach of signing the player on loan. However, the deal is yet to be completed, and might take a drastic turn in case another club emerges in the mix.

While Hutchison has recommended Endrick's name to the club, West Ham might not be the ideal destination for the Brazilian. The Hammers currently sit 18th in the Premier League and are not a part of a continental competition. Battling to establish a better ranking to not fight relegation, West Ham do need a few reinforcements in the side, but signing Endrick might not be the best option for them. Returning from injury, Endrick is yet to achieve a start this season. Moreover, the club's conditions don't comply with the clauses set by the player.

Marseille striker Mason Greenwood has won the Ligue 1 Player of the Month award for October, marking the second time he has received the accolade since his transfer from Manchester United in the summer of 2024. The 24-year-old England international scored five Ligue 1 goals last month, including a remarkable four-goal haul during Marseille's dominant 6-2 victory against Le Havre.

The English international has been named Ligue 1 Player of the Month for October, as announced by the UNFP (Union Nationale des Footballeurs Professionnels), the players' union, on Sunday. This marks a significant achievement for Greenwood, who has continued to rebuild his career in France following his move from Manchester United.

Greenwood's exceptional form in October saw him net five goals in Ligue 1. A standout performance included scoring four goals during Marseille's emphatic 6-2 win against Le Havre. He also contributed a goal in a narrow 2-1 loss against Lens, demonstrating his consistent attacking threat. This impressive tally of goals and overall contribution saw him beat out competition from Strasbourg's Joaquin Panichelli and OGC Nice's Sofiane Diop for the individual honour, securing 38% of the vote.

This is the second time Greenwood has received the Ligue 1 Player of the Month award since joining Marseille in the summer of 2024. His consistent recognition underscores his impact on the French top flight.

Greenwood's current season statistics highlight his ongoing influence at Marseille. So far this season, he has scored nine goals and provided four assists across 15 appearances in all competitions. This follows a highly successful debut campaign in 2024-25, where he made an immediate impact after his permanent transfer from Manchester United.

In his first season in Ligue 1, Greenwood scored an impressive 21 league goals in 34 matches, tying with PSG's Ousmane Dembele for the French Golden Boot. Marseille finished second behind Paris Saint-Germain in that campaign, a testament to Greenwood's vital contribution to their league challenge. His overall record with OM stands at 31 goals and ten assists in 51 games played across all competitions, as reported by AFP.

Marseille are currently in a close contest for the Ligue 1 title, trailing league leaders PSG by just two points. Greenwood's prolific scoring and creative play are central to their ambitions.

Despite his strong club form, Greenwood's international future remains a significant talking point. He made his only senior international appearance for England in 2020 in a Nations League clash against Iceland. Following serious criminal allegations, which were later dropped, his journey with the Three Lions appeared to end, leading to him being ""blacklisted by the FA and head coach Thomas Tuchel from selection,"" according to the Daily Mail.

Earlier this year, Greenwood acquired Jamaican citizenship through his lineage, making him eligible to represent the Jamaican national team. Jamaica's manager, former England boss Steve McClaren, even called him up for World Cup qualifiers in September. However, Greenwood did not commit at that time.

McClaren explained in September: ""We acquired a passport and we expected him to be coming to this camp but on a conversation with his family, he's not going to commit at this time to anybody. So he's taking his time over that."" He added: ""We will keep pursuing him because I know from my conversations with Mason that he loves Jamaica, he respects Jamaica. He wants to concentrate on club football and not commit to an international team at the moment.""

Despite this, reports suggest Greenwood is ""obsessed"" with the idea of returning to St George's Park and still believes he can play for England again, even with the FA and Tuchel's current stance. With the 2026 World Cup approaching, a comeback for England appears improbable, yet Greenwood's ambition persists.

Greenwood's impressive performances in France have inevitably sparked speculation about a potential return to the Premier League. While a return to English top-flight football is considered ""extremely unlikely"" in the short term due to the significant public scrutiny an English club would face, reports suggest interest from Premier League sides.

TEAMtalk reported interest from Tottenham and West Ham in signing Greenwood in 2026. Spurs are reportedly seeking a ""dynamic, energetic player,"" while West Ham see him as a ""potential game-changer."" However, the report also indicates strong interest from other European clubs, with Atletico Madrid, impressed by his loan spell at Getafe, keen to bring him back to La Liga. Saudi Pro League clubs like Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr are also reportedly preparing lucrative offers, though Greenwood's current preference is to remain in Europe and compete in the Champions League.

Greenwood will continue to be a central figure for Marseille as they push for the Ligue 1 title, sitting just two points behind PSG. His goal-scoring prowess will be vital in their domestic campaign.

Beyond Ligue 1, Greenwood is set to face English clubs Newcastle and Liverpool in upcoming Champions League fixtures. These matches will provide him with a significant platform to demonstrate his capabilities on the international club stage, further showcasing his talent against top-tier European opposition. His performances in these high-profile games could influence future transfer movements and potentially even his international aspirations, as he remains focused on club football for the immediate future.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is edging into view and excitement is increasingly palpable ahead of football's grandest competition. 

Forty-eight nations will compete in the newly-expanded format in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, attempting to etch their name into the history books and join the pantheon of greats to have lifted the golden trophy aloft. 

Many have already qualified for the tournament but only a handful of countries harbor genuine hopes of world domination. 

Here are Sports Illustrated's rankings for the most likely 2026 World Cup winners.

Four-time world champions Italy have failed to qualify for the last two tournaments, but were crowned European champions in between their surprise absences in Russia and Qatar. Their unpredictability certainly doesn't aid their chances of winning the 2026 World Cup.They are also under new management after the dismissal of Luciano Spalletti back in June, with Gennaro Gattuso taking over the hot seat. The former midfielder has failed to dazzle on the sidelines since stepping into management, most recently coaching Hajduk Split in Croatia, but he does boast an incredibly talented squad. Italy are also not guaranteed their place at the tournament, either. Finishing behind Norway in qualifying means they must duke it out in the playoffs, and while they should still reach the tournament, they have fumbled on the big stage previously.    If they make it, however, they will still be among the leading nations. 

Uruguay are two-time winners of the World Cup, but have failed to reach the final since their last triumph all the way back in 1950. A fourth-place finish in South Africa was the closest they have come in the 21st century to adding another star above their crest. La Celeste secured their place at the upcoming World Cup in September and could be among the dark horses heading to North America. They beat both Argentina and Brazil during qualifying and have shown encouraging signs under Marcelo Bielsa. They will have to upset the odds if they're to secure a third World Cup crown, but they boast impressive quality throughout their squad and on the touchline. 

The Netherlands are still awaiting their first World Cup win having thrice been losing finalists, but have the opportunity to rectify historical heartbreak in North America. It will not be easy, but a squad laced with world-class talent always has a chance. The issue for the Netherlands is that they are yet to convince under Ronald Koeman. Despite the quality within their team—Liverpool quartet Jeremie Frimpong, Virgil van Dijk, Ryan Gravenberch and Cody Gakpo being a good example—they have struggled with defensive organization and still lack a truly elite No. 9.  Those are limiting factors in tournament soccer but the Netherlands can take solace from their run to the semifinals at Euro 2024. 

Germany are no longer the all-conquering force they once were and failed to go beyond the group stage at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups despite winning the competition in 2014. They were also defeated at the quarterfinal stage at Euro 2024 on home soil. Julian Nagelsmann has struggled to fully command Die Mannschaft since his arrival in 2023, laboring through the qualification process.Again, they have phenomenal operators within their team, but there remain question marks over their strength in defense and between the sticks. 

Five-time world champions Brazil will always be among the favorites heading into a major tournament, even if their recent performances at the World Cup and Copa América have been extremely underwhelming. At the World Cup, they haven't reached the final since 2002 and have been dumped out at the quarterfinals on their last two attempts. They could only make the last eight at the Copa América in 2024, too, which was also staged in North America. Carlo Ancelotti's arrival brings with it hope, especially given the Italian's record in knockout football, but Brazil, much like Germany, are not the colossal force of yesteryear.Luckily, they have the attacking weapons to instil fear in all defenses they come up against. Rodrygo, Vinícius Júnior, Raphinha, Matheus Cunha, João Pedro... what more do you need?

Portugal are another contender for the World Cup that have never won the competition previously, although they have developed the winning habit on the European stage over the past decade. They have won Euro 2016 and the UEFA Nations League on two separate occasions, forging an incredible team in the process. Cristiano Ronaldo continues to shatter records while leading the line, but his supporting cast is arguably more impressive. An all-star midfield contains the likes of João Neves, Vitinha and Bruno Fernandes, while their forward options include the likes of Rafael Leão, Pedro Neto and João Félix. Manager Roberto Martínez could prove a restrictive factor come the latter stages of the tournament, and expectations must be tempered given Portugal have failed to make it beyond the last eight at their previous four World Cups. 

England supporters continue to sing lovingly about their 1966 World Cup triumph but they would love to update their songbook next summer. The Three Lions have continually underwhelmed at tournaments since their sole major triumph over 60 years ago. But it feels inevitable that such heartache will be cured sooner rather than later. Under Gareth Southgate, England reached the Euro 2020 and 2024 finals, suffering narrow defeats to Italy and Spain respectively. They managed a fourth-place finish at the 2018 World Cup and were defeated by defending champions France at the quarterfinal stage four years later in a match of fine margins.Thomas Tuchel has made a winning start to his reign and England are now hitting their stride under the German coach. He has an extraordinary squad and has already built a rock solid defense which didn't concede a single goal throughout eight qualifying matches.

2018 world champions France arguably lay claim to the best squad in international football, but that hasn't always translated to silverware in recent years. The divisive Didier Deschamps has failed to guide Les Bleus to glory in the last three major tournaments, although his side did reach the World Cup final in 2022 only to be beaten by Argentina.France are always a devastating presence at the Euros and World Cup, with Deschamps's pragmatic style lending itself to knockout competitions. They don't always sparkle with free-flowing football, but they will always be there or thereabouts at the end of the tournament. France have blitzed their opponents en route to North America and have immense quality throughout their team. The likes of Kylian Mbappé and Michael Olise will be game-changers for Deschamps next summer. 

Luis de la Fuente has transformed Spain since stepping into the senior dugout. He guided them to the 2022–23 Nations League title and Euro 2024 glory, and will be eager to keep the good times rolling at the World Cup.The 2010 world champions have struggled at recent World Cups, failing to go beyond the last 16 at the previous three. However, there is something different about this iteration of Spain, who have the tools required to emulate Vicente del Bosque's stunning team of the late 2000s and early 2010s. La Roja have an industrious and well-organized defense, a technical yet robust midfield and a tantalizing reserve of forwards, with Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams particularly exciting propositions on the wings. They will expect to win the World Cup in North America such is their quality and experience. 

It's difficult to look beyond defending champions Argentina as favorites. La Albiceleste won the World Cup for the first time since 1986 with their triumph in Qatar, securing Lionel Messi that all-important title that had agonisingly eluded him previously. Well, the 2026 World Cup could be Messi's last hurrah for Argentina and it would be a fitting exit for the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner were the South Americans to secure a fourth title in the competition. Lionel Scaloni has masterminded Argentina's return to the summit and has an almost flawless record in major tournaments. He has won the last two Copa Américas to add to his World Cup success and few have been able to match his team over recent years.Bar an almighty implosion in the buildup to the tournament, Argentina will surely be the leading candidates for another World Cup title.

The latest phase of FIFA's ticket lottery for the 2026 World Cup has not gone off without a hitch.

Though a schedule won't be out until after the World Cup draw occurs next month in Washington, D.C., one million tickets are progressively being made available through FIFA's early ticketing process for matches that take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada beginning June 11. The newest batch were released through a randomized lottery system on Monday, Nov. 17, but many fans encountered the same problem 'captcha' error when trying to purchase tickets.

A 'captcha' test is typically designed to determine if an online user is really a human and not a bot, via a question or image. The captcha image used for FIFA's ticketing process on Monday, however, appeared to be malfunctioning and not loading properly for lots of people trying to secure their spot at the World Cup. And they weren't thrilled to be getting an error message.

For The Win's Charles Curtis was among those to be selected randomly to potentially purchase 2026 World Cup tickets on Nov. 17 and also encountered the 'captcha' error. Eventually, he was able to get through after some unscheduled angst and reloading a new captcha ""a bunch of times.""

The early ticket draw period for the 2026 World Cup began on Oct. 27 after the conclusion of the Visa presale in September. This second phase included a lottery reserved for fans from only the three host countries. Monday's ticket sales were for fans from the United States, Mexico, Canada and across the globe. If selected by lottery, they can purchase available single-match and team-specific game tickets.

“We already have seen massive interest from around the world for this tournament, and especially from within the host countries as Canada, Mexico and the United States prepare to host the biggest FIFA World Cup yet,” FIFA World Cup 2026 COO Heimo Schirgi said in a statement last month. “This second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say thank you to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well.”

WHEN IS THE DRAW?

The draw for the World Cup play-off is on Thursday at 12pm in Switzerland. It will be live on RTÉ platforms. More details will be confirmed shortly.

FORMAT 

There will be 16 teams chasing the last four European spots. The play-off consists of a semi-final and final. Each round is a single leg.

The 12 group runners-up from World Cup qualifying and the four best-ranked UEFA Nations League section winners that have not already qualified will be in the draw.

The 16 teams will be drawn into four play-off paths, with four teams in each, making up two semi-finals and a final.

Each play-off path is composed of two semi-final pairings of one seeded team and one unseeded team: pot 1 versus pot 4 and pot 2 versus pot 3.

WHEN ARE THE MATCHES?

The semi-final will be on Thursday 26 March. If Ireland progress to the final, Tuesday 31 March is the date.

WHAT COUNTRIES CAN IRELAND FACE? 

We need to wait for the qualification process to finish over the next 48 hours.

Italy, Czech Republic and Albania are in the hat at the moment and Poland are likely to follow. The rest will be decided by the games to be played on Sunday and Monday.

Romania, Sweden and Northern Ireland will also be there due to their Nations League performance, along with one more side. As it stands, Wales look the most likely, but they could also become a runner-up and open the door to another team.

HOW DOES THE DRAW WORK? 

The 12 group runners-up will be allocated to Pots 1 to 3, with seeding based on FIFA ranking to determine the order.

Pot 1 and 2 will be home teams as seeds.

Pot 3 are unseeded and away from home along with Pot 4, which are the Nations League teams. So if Ireland are unseeded, we will not be playing a Nations League-qualified side.

WILL THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND BE SEEDED? 

Due to the Republic of Ireland being 62nd in the world when this window started, it's up in the air and needs some things to fall our way.

The Boys in Green would need to be in the top 7 of the 12 runners-up. We won't know for sure until FIFA issue new rankings on Wednesday when the seedings are confirmed as our wins over Portugal and Hungary will move us up.

There are crucial games on Monday and Tuesday to determine it.

COULD IRELAND PLAY AT HOME? 

It all depends on our pot. We'll be at home if it's Pot 2 and away from home if Pot 3.

We could be at home in the final. There will be a draw for the home finalists on Thursday following the semi-final draw. One semi-final tie from each of the four paths will be selected as a home finalist.

AND IF WE REACHED THE WORLD CUP?

The draw for the World Cup outright will be made on 5 December, before the play-off matches take place.

Therefore we'll know what our group would be and the cities we would play in. The carrot will be well and truly dangled.

A total of 48 teams are competing in the 2026 World Cup, divided into 12 groups of four.

Troy Parrott's last-gasp goal and DR Congo's triumph proved once again why the best soccer is almost never about the soccer

Sign up for Soccer with Jonathan Wilson here

Last Thursday, Irish football was in a bleak place. They had two games remaining in World Cup qualifying and apparently no hope of making it to North America next summer. Another campaign had collapsed in predictable ways: they couldn't score, they made bafflingly simple errors, too few of their players play for elite sides and those that do seemed unable to reproduce club form for their country.

Their one possible star, Evan Ferguson, had not been energised by a move to Roma – quite the reverse – and although there was vague talk of a new contract for their manager, the amiable Icelandic dentist Heimir Hallgrímsson, everybody thought he would be off after the game in Hungary and was vaguely dreading another Football Association of Ireland recruitment saga, which would inevitably take months, throw up a series of implausible names and result in the job being given to Hallgrímsson's assistant, John O'Shea.

What made it all the more frustrating was that, if you could somehow leave aside the abject defeat in Armenia and the two daft goals conceded early against Hungary in Dublin, there had actually been, if you looked really closely, glimmers of positivity – albeit those are much clearer in hindsight. They had played pretty well to come back to draw that game against Hungary. They had held Portugal in Lisbon until injury-time, despite an extremely soft penalty being awarded against them. But when Ferguson, who had scored the only goal in an uninspiring home win over Armenia last month, succumbed to an ankle injury, all seemed lost.

Enter Troy Parrott. The 23-year-old used to be the great hope of Irish football. It never quite worked for him at Tottenham, though, and he ended up moving to the Netherlands. He's started to blossom at AZ, scoring 14 league goals last season and six in seven games this season. But there had only ever really been flickers at international level. He had fallen behind Ferguson in the pecking order. But he scored twice in the first half against Portugal on Thursday. Then Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off for an elbow, which added, for the Irish, an element of delicious comedy. A lad who performed the crybaby gesture at the superstar as he left the pitch became a brief celebrity.

And beyond it all, conveniently disguised between headlines about Ronaldo's first international red card, was the realisation that they could take second in the group and a playoff spot.

This is what these final weeks of World Cup qualifying can do. Unexpected possibilities suddenly emerge. That's why these games can be some of the greatest in football; opportunity can suddenly knock for teams who are unused to it. There is a great democracy to it: whether you're Erling Haaland or Ireland's Finn Azaz, Kylian Mbappé or Meschak Elia of DR Congo, the prize is the same.

All Ireland had to do was win in Hungary against a team who, for all their superior players, had looked vulnerable in Dublin. The event itself almost felt like a different sport than the one played in the Premier League: tension and occasional flurries of action, football in its rawest form. Ireland went behind after three minutes. Parrott levelled with a penalty. They went behind again before half-time, but that almost made it easier: they had to score twice in the second half. On the hour, Festy Ebosele and debutant Johnny Kenny came on for Seamus Coleman and Jayson Molumby, a final attacking gamble. Parrott levelled on 80 minutes, a finish of real deftness.

The clock hit 90. Still 2-2. Five minutes added. The game moved into a sixth additional minute. Caoimhin Kelleher launched a long pass from halfway. Liam Scales flicked it on. There was a momentum, an inevitability, everything converging all at once on the Hungarian goal. The keeper Dénes Dibusz hesitated. Parrott got ahead of his man, got a toe to the ball and, with apparent icy clarity of vision, had the awareness to nudge the ball down. Up or horizontal and Dibusz might have got a hand to it; down he had no chance. Parrott had become the first Ireland player to score an international hat-trick outside Dublin.

The celebrations were wild, and that was just to get into a playoff, which will take place at the end of March next year. For four months there will be hope and anticipation, just as there will be for DR Congo, who on Sunday beat a disappointing Nigeria on penalties in a playoff for Africa's place in the intercontinental qualifying playoffs (which do not involve Europe).

The quality had been limited in Rabat for that one as well, but who cares? That's not what the international game is about. It's about desire and effort and will. It's about drama and narrative – the stories that countries will tell for eternity. The best football is almost never about the football, and that's why the World Cup remains the purest form of the game.

Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer

after newsletter promotion

17 November 1993 might be the greatest night of World Cup qualifying in history. Amid a highly charged atmosphere in Belfast, Ireland drew 1-1 with Northern Ireland to secure their place at USA 94, aided by Spain beating Denmark 1-0 despite having their goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta sent off after 10 minutes, his young replacement Santiago Cañizares producing the performance of a lifetime. Paul Bodin hit the bar with a penalty as Wales missed out by drawing with Romania. England provided comic relief by going behind against San Marino after eight seconds.

But the greatest drama happened in Paris. France would already have qualified but for a shock defeat to Israel, but everybody expected them to get the draw they needed at home to Bulgaria. With 15 seconds remaining they had an attacking free-kick on the right. David Ginola could have taken the ball into the corner but inexplicably crossed into a box almost empty of France players – a “crime”, as his manager, Gérard Houllier, described it. Bulgaria broke at speed, culminating in Emil Kostadinov lashing in a stunning finish that eliminated France. Kostadinov shouldn't even have been in the country, having failed to secure a visa, but had been smuggled in at a remote border post near Mulhouse.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Jeremy Doku launches scathing attack on Belgium team-mates after Red Devils throw away chance to secure World Cup qualification","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/jeremy-doku-scathing-attack-belgium-team-mates-red-devils-throw-away-chance-to-secure-world-cup-qualification/blt4a23a2b6a5478ca8","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 10:06:29 GMT","

Manchester City's star winger Jeremy Doku launched a scathing attack on his Belgium team-mates after the Red Devils threw away a chance to secure an automatic World Cup qualification during the weekend. The European giants failed to register a win against a 10-man Kazakhstan side as they came back from behind to play out a 1-1 draw in Astana on Saturday. 

The Red Devils, who have now won just one out of their last three international games, were held to a 1-1 draw as they came back from behind against Kazakhstan. Rudi Garcia's side dealt with an early blow as Dastan Satpayev latched on to a loose ball at the back and handed the hosts the lead in the ninth. Belgium then staged a comeback early in the second half as Hans Vanaken equalised for his side from Timothy Castagne's assist. 

Kazakhstan were reduced to 10 men in the 79th minute when striker Islam Chesnokov picked up a direct red card, but Belgium failed to take the man advantage and pile on the opposition's misery. 

After the game, a frustrated Doku ranted against his colleagues as he told reporters: ""We've already dropped too many points because we weren't good enough in a large number of matches. Our campaign hasn't gone well, no. Everyone needs to do better. The coach, me, everyone. Kevin, Romelu. Thibaut, if we need them to win against Kazakhstan, then we can't do anything at the World Cup. We looked at this team and thought they would play long but then they played short and started playing football. It was a completely different match than last time. Maybe we didn't analyse our opponent enough.""

Defender Arthur Theate also expressed his frustration as he added: ""If you feel like it, go ahead. It's not that I disagree. But if you concede a goal, that's the problem. If you don't score, it's the attack's fault. Of course, we shouldn't have conceded that goal but we haven't conceded many goals this campaign. Agreed, conceding three goals at home against Wales wouldn't have been right. 'But otherwise, we weren't put in much danger. But you can judge for yourself.

Belgium threw away an opportunity to secure a direct qualification to the World Cup next year but they still remain the favourites to book their berth in the flagship from Group J. With 15 points from seven points, Belgium stand at the top of their group, two points clear of North Macedonia.

A win against rock bottom Liechtenstein on Tuesday will help them secure World Cup qualification. North Macedonia and Wales, on the other hand, will clash in their final group game to secure a play-offs spot. 

Individually, Doku has enjoyed a purple patch in the 2025-26 campaign with Manchester City. He has featured in 16 matches across all competitions for Pep Guardiola's side where he has scored three goals and provided four assists. 

Former City star Paul Dickov recently hailed Doku as the best winger in the world, as he told Betting Bonuses: “I would say he's probably the best in Europe at the minute. Not just of his performance against Liverpool, which was top drawer, but I said before the game, that despite Erling Haaland's goals, Doku has consistently been City's best player and biggest threat. 

""People were forgetting last season. They were questioning his end product a little bit. And maybe he was doing all these dribbles and was playing at a mile-a-minute. Maybe his crossing and finishing suffered, but he's worked so hard at his game. He's only 23 years old. He's a young boy, and he's just impossible to defend against when he gets you one on one.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate admits that transfer speculation has left him in a “tight spot”, with questions continuing to be asked of how long he will remain at Anfield. The France international defender is into the final year of his contract, meaning that he could hit free agency in the summer of 2026. La Liga giants Real Madrid are being credited with interest.

Konate can do little to stop the rumours, with no extension to his current terms being agreed on Merseyside. For as long as his future remains up in the air, the 26-year-old centre-half will find himself at the centre of distracting gossip.

There has been talk of a new deal being agreed with Liverpool, as Konate has been with the Reds since 2021. It has also been suggested that he could tread a similar path to former team-mate Trent Alexander-Arnold by swapping Liverpool for Madrid - with no transfer fee needing to change hands.

Konate is eager to point out that there is no substance to the speculation that he continues to generate, with no definitive decisions being made on his future. His form has dipped slightly this season, with Liverpool enduring uncharacteristic issues as a collective, with the exit rumours doing little to aid his cause.

Speaking to TF1 while on 2026 World Cup qualifying duty with France, Konate said when asked about his regular presence in gossip columns: “It's difficult, we can't say everything because a lot of things are already being said in the media.”

He went on to say of unwelcome stories potentially casting him in a bad light with loyal Liverpool supporters: “Some of the things that I read, I'm like… oh la la. That puts me in a tight spot with Liverpool fans, and they don't even know all the ins and outs.”

Konate has previously said of lining up a decision day with Premier League heavyweights: “My agents continue to discuss with Liverpool. I hope my decision will be made very soon so I can announce it.”

Legendary former Reds defender Jamie Carragher is hoping that a deal can be agreed with Konate. He has told the Daily Mail: ""I'd like him to stay but if he doesn't stay, Liverpool will sign someone else. Liverpool won't fall apart if Konate leaves. He's not Virgil van Dijk. He's a good centre-back who you hope will sign, but if he doesn't want to sign, Liverpool will be absolutely fine.

“He's a very good centre-back, he's a title winner at Liverpool, he's played in the Champions League final against Real Madrid. He's obviously a quality centre-back. It's not poor management [if he goes for free]. You can't physically make somebody sign a contract. Then it's your decision, do you keep him to the length of his contract or do you sell him?”

Liverpool were disappointed to lose home-grown star Alexander-Arnold to La Liga giants in the summer of 2025. A small fee was paid there, with Real prepared to complete a transfer prior to the England international officially becoming a free agent - with the Blancos' FIFA Club World Cup campaign being factored into the equation.

Konate has revealed that fellow countryman Kylian Mbapppe “calls me every two hours to sign for Real Madrid"", with the World Cup-winning forward acting as an agent for those at Santiago Bernabeu.

It may be that Konate ends up joining Mbappe in the Spanish capital. He has taken in 148 appearances for Liverpool across four-and-a-half seasons, registering six goals. Konate has formed part of Premier League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup-winning squads.

While Liverpool would like to retain his services, they were heavily linked with Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi over the summer. He is another that is heading towards free agency in 2026, meaning that the Reds could land themselves a ready-made replacement for Konate. They also acquired highly-rated Italian defender Giovanni Leoni in the last transfer window and are expecting big things from him once a complete recovery from an unfortunate ACL injury has been made.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester United are monitoring AZ Alkmaar sensation Kees Smit as they look to finally address their long-standing midfield issues, but face rival interest from within the Premier League. The 19-year-old Dutch international is attracting interest from multiple elite clubs, with AZ prepared to demand around £25 million for their prized academy graduate.

Manchester United have identified Smit as a potential solution to their midfield rebuild, as per CentreDevils, with sources confirming that scouts have been closely monitoring the AZ Alkmaar starlet's development this season. Director of Recruitment Christopher Vivell has already discussed the teenager internally, signalling that United consider him one of the most promising young midfield profiles available on the market. His age, tactical intelligence and technical quality make him an attractive long-term investment for a club beginning to reshape its spine.

AZ are understood to value the player at roughly £25 million ($33m), a figure widely regarded as modest given his projection and growing international pedigree. The Red Devils are far from alone in their admiration; however, with several clubs across Europe already making enquiries, and domestic rivals in the Premier League expected to intensify their efforts in the coming weeks. Newcastle are pushing hardest alongside United in the race, with their interest described as ""gathering serious momentum"".

Despite United's growing desire to strengthen early, a January move looks unlikely at this stage. Instead, the 20-time Premier League champions could position themselves for a summer approach, allowing time for negotiations and squad adjustments. Smit is open to a step up and views a transition to a bigger European club as his natural next step.

United's midfield issues have been evident for several seasons, arising from a blend of ageing personnel and uneven squad construction. Casemiro will turn 34 next year and has begun to show physical decline, occasionally leaving the defence exposed. Meanwhile, Bruno Fernandes has often been forced into unfamiliar roles as cover inside the double pivot.

Kobbie Mainoo remains the club's most exciting midfield talent, but his limited minutes this campaign underline United's need to protect young players rather than rely on them to paper over structural gaps. With Mainoo potentially heading out on loan for developmental reasons, the squad risks a further drop in depth. The lack of a true, specialist holding midfielder continues to prevent the side from asserting control in big games under Ruben Amorim's philosophy.

The ambition within the club is clear: evolve the midfield from reactive chaos to proactive dominance. The Red Devils want a player capable of anchoring possession, dictating transitions, and restoring balance between their attacking aggression and defensive stability. Smit fits the ideal profile - and the recruitment team sees him as a long-term cornerstone rather than a short-term patch.

Smit is widely regarded as one of the finest midfielders to emerge from AZ's academy, a system that has consistently produced intelligent, technically excellent talents. The Netherlands youth international has captained teams above his age group and earned senior football experience early through Jong AZ in the Eerste Divisie. At just 19, he already demonstrates a level of composure and decision-making beyond many established professionals.

Operating primarily as a deep-lying midfielder, Smit excels in reading play, shielding the back line and dictating tempo with exceptional passing range. His ability to play both short and progressive long balls makes him the central hub for AZ's build-up phases. Because of this, comparisons have been drawn with fellow Dutch orchestrators such as Frenkie de Jong - though Smit boasts a more naturally defensive instinct.

Manchester United must decide whether to advance negotiations quickly or risk a rival outmanoeuvring them. With Newcastle already stepping up their approach and big European clubs circling, hesitation could prove costly. A summer move currently appears the most realistic scenario, giving United time to free up squad space, resolve outgoing uncertainties and refine their long-term midfield blueprint.

For Smit, the upcoming months are crucial as he weighs his next destination and prepares for a potential leap into a major league. AZ will hold firm on their valuation, knowing demand continues to rise with every standout performance. Whether he ultimately lands at Old Trafford or elsewhere, the race to secure one of the Netherlands' brightest midfield prospects is only just heating up.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Real Madrid have suffered another setback as Dean Huijsen has withdrawn from Spain duty due to muscle discomfort, raising concerns of a relapse of the soleus injury he suffered in October. The defender has been sent back to Madrid for tests, joining Kylian Mbappe and Eduardo Camavinga as the latest Los Blancos players to return early from international duty.

Madrid were dealt an unwelcome blow after Spain confirmed that Huijsen had been released from the national team camp due to renewed muscle discomfort. The defender was unavailable for the match against Georgia earlier in the week, and further assessment by La Roja's medical staff confirmed he was not fit to continue.

He will now return immediately to Valdebebas, where Madrid's medical department will run full tests to determine whether this is a fresh issue or a recurrence of the soleus injury he suffered in October. Spain face Turkey next, but Huijsen will take no further part in the international break.

Madrid are relieved he was not risked, but the timing raises concern. Only last month he was sent back from Spain duty with the same calf problem, treated in Madrid, and managed to recover just in time to rejoin the squad for El Clasico. The early fear now is that this latest discomfort may be a relapse of that injury.

Huijsen's current setback traces back to the soleus muscle tear he suffered during Spain's October camp. The injury occurred in training, forcing him to withdraw before their World Cup qualifiers. Los Blancos confirmed a minor tear that required rest and a tailored recovery plan, keeping him out of the matches against Getafe and Juventus.

During Huijsen's absence, Madrid relied heavily on Eder Militao and Raul Asencio to stabilise the back line. His recovery was smooth enough for him to rejoin full training ahead of the season's first El Clasico on October 26, where he made his return without complications.

This month's relapse comes during a period in which multiple Madrid players have been recalled early from international duty. Mbappe and Camavinga were also withdrawn from France's squad earlier in the week.

France were forced into late changes when Mbappe and Camavinga were both released before the final World Cup qualifier against Azerbaijan. Mbappe continues to manage recurring inflammation in his right ankle, an issue that resurfaced the morning after France's 4-0 win over Ukraine, where he scored twice and reached 400 career goals.

Although he completed the match, renewed discomfort prompted a joint decision between the French Football Federation (FFF) and Madrid to send him back for further evaluation. The French federation stressed that the decision was precautionary, with no indication of a serious injury, but Madrid preferred immediate testing to avoid aggravation ahead of a heavy schedule.

Camavinga, meanwhile, had not trained all week due to left-hamstring discomfort. With no improvement and Khephren Thuram already brought in as cover, he was deemed unfit for both fixtures and was sent back to Spain. Madrid expect him to recover in time for the La Liga match against Elche on November 23.

Both Mbappe and Camavinga are projected to be available after the break, but their simultaneous withdrawals underline the physical strain Madrid's core players have been carrying.

For Xabi Alonso, the coming days will revolve around clarity. Huijsen's scans at Valdebebas will determine whether he faces a short spell of rest or a longer recovery similar to October. With Mbappé and Camavinga returning early as well, the manager must prepare for three possible absences as Madrid enter a demanding stretch of fixtures.

Madrid resume their season against Elche on November 23, followed by a crucial Champions League match against Olympiacos on November 26 and a top-of-the-table meeting with Girona on November 30. Alonso may turn once again to Militao and Asencio if Huijsen is unavailable, while midfield rotation will depend heavily on Camavinga's fitness and match readiness.

The next 72 hours of medical evaluations will shape Alonso's approach, but what is clear is that Madrid enter the post-break period with caution and the need for careful management of their biggest stars.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Former West Ham United player Don Hutchison has urged the club to sign Real Madrid star Endrick. The Brazilian is not receiving enough playing time under the new Los Blancos head coach, Xabi Alonso, and is looking for a new club in the upcoming January transfer window. Although he has a few suitors, West Ham are yet to establish themselves as a top option for the youngster, who has a few conditions before making a switch.

In 2024, Endrick was signed with a lot of hope by the Madrid board, as he shone bright in Brazil while featuring for Palmeiras. His first season, which was under Italian head coach Carlo Ancelotti, saw him register 37 appearances, scoring seven goals and providing an assist. However, ever since the start of the Xabi Alonso era this season, the Brazilian wonderkid has yet to find a place in the starting lineup, or even in the squad. As now now, he has managed only 11 minutes in La Liga, and is currently seeking a way out of the club to reclaim his firing form. While Alonso had claimed that he has faith on the 2006 born Brazilian, he is yet to give me a proper chance to shine. Moreover, the competition inside the squad has been immense, with Gonzalo Garcia climbing the pecking order after his sensational performances at the Club World Cup and Kylian Mbappe establishing himself as their most important goal-getter. 

It is estimated that Endrick is moving out of Madrid, but his destination is yet to be guaranteed. Amidst this, former West Ham player Hutchison has urged his former club to sign the 19-year-old. 

He told Sportscasting: ""Yeah, I think it would be a good move for West Ham to get Endrick if it's possible. He's a strong boy. You look at the physicality. He's stocky and he's strong. He needs to be given time, which is hard in the Premier League. He might be better off going to Sociedad like Isak or Odegaard did. Sometimes it pays to stay in La Liga, but you go and play every single week, building your strength, lungs and legs up. You get your confidence, goals and your mentality and bring it up that way. 

""Because what you wouldn't want to do is bring him to West Ham or a team in the Premier League that are in a relegation fight, where you haven't got time to play them every single game, because you might be losing games along the way. You haven't got time to bed these young kids in. So if I was Endrick, I'd be looking at a short-term move in La Liga to try and play every single week to then have the potential to either move to England or back to Real Madrid. That being said, it's a move that I would endorse for the Hammers.""

Signing Endrick would not be easy for West Ham, as the youngster has some conditions to fulfil in his procedure of selecting a new club. His first criterion is the weight of the league, and it has to be among the top ones in Europe. While he might consider the top clubs in Portugal, his preference is England, Spain, France, Italy, and Germany. Moreover, the club needs to be a participant in the continental competitions and a strong contender for the domestic league. Lastly, the team needs to have an attacking mindset so as to comply with Endrick's strengths. French outfit Lyon have emerged as a potential destination for the 19-year-old, ousting Manchester United's approach of signing the player on loan. However, the deal is yet to be completed, and might take a drastic turn in case another club emerges in the mix.

While Hutchison has recommended Endrick's name to the club, West Ham might not be the ideal destination for the Brazilian. The Hammers currently sit 18th in the Premier League and are not a part of a continental competition. Battling to establish a better ranking to not fight relegation, West Ham do need a few reinforcements in the side, but signing Endrick might not be the best option for them. Returning from injury, Endrick is yet to achieve a start this season. Moreover, the club's conditions don't comply with the clauses set by the player.

Premier League Alan Shearer slammed Manchester United for overpaying on the Benjamin Sesko transfer deal as he admitted he does not have high hopes for the Red Devils' £70m striker. Sesko is off to a slow start since moving to Old Trafford from RB Leipzig. The Slovenia international has struggled for form in the 2025-26 campaign and has scored just two goals in 12 matches across all competitions.

United pursued the Sesko transfer for a long time in the last transfer window and finally managed to secure the move in August as they agreed to pay £74million ($100m) to RB Leipzig. The highly-rated Bundesliga was a priority transfer for the Red Devils, who were desperate to solve their goal scoring woes after a nightmare campaign in the 2024-25 season.

Sesko, though, has yet to live up to the high price tag as he has scored just two goals in the Premier League and has started in only six out of the 11 matches the club played. In their latest outing against Tottenham Hotspur, which ended in a 2-2 draw, Ruben Amorim introduced Sesko in the 58th minute, only to sub him off in the closing stages of the match after a robust challenge from Micky van de Ven.

At the end of the game, Amorim expressed concern over the striker's condition, while ignoring questions on his form. The Portuguese coach said: ""That is not the biggest concern now. That happens, especially with a striker. I am more concerned with an injury, because it's in the knee, we don't know, we need Ben to be a better team. I have no idea. Because it's the knee we never know.""

Newcastle icon Shearer has now opened up on Sesko's struggles, while slamming the Red Devils for spending heavily on his transfer, as he told Betfair: ""One player that must do better for United is Benjamin Sesko. They paid 70 odd million for him. That was a lot of money, I know it's the market but it was too much. He's had a tough start and I don't expect huge things from him to be honest.

""I think he's a good player but I'm not sure he's any more than that. He should have scored a couple more goals than he has so far. It's been a tough start for him, especially considering the money United paid.""

Following his injury in the Spurs game, Sesko was ruled out of action during the international break and could take the field for Slovenia in the World Cup qualifiers. Speaking about Sesko's injury and struggles with form, national team head coach Matjaz Kek told reporters: ""With all due respect to a great club like Manchester United, we have officially not received anything yet; no papers, no documents. We would certainly like to get them. We want our medical team to also take a look at it. Our doctor is an expert in this field. We don't have just anyone in this position. I cannot comment, of course, I have certain information, and I am also in contact with Beni, of course. I can't say anything because officially, we don't know anything at all. 

""United haven't contacted anyone from our camp. Of course, I am concerned about the player; the only thing that matters to me is his wellbeing. We are prepared to do everything for that, and we have never sent anyone onto the field if there was the slightest risk. However, the national team is something very special, and I expect maximum respect from everyone. Slovenia deserves that, even if on the other side there is a powerhouse like England, and something as extraordinary as the Premier League. After all, it has been quite some time since England defeated Slovenia, and that in itself says something about us.""

The 22-year-old underwent several tests on his knee and the club are confident he has avoided a serious injury and believe the striker will recover swiftly. It now remains to be seen if Amorim keeps Sesko in his matchday squad in their next match after the international break against Everton on November 24.

Ian Wright has hit back at critics of England superstar Jude Bellingham, with the Real Madrid midfielder facing more questions of his supposedly petulant behaviour. The 22-year-old was less than impressed at being replaced during the Three Lions' final 2026 World Cup qualifier against Albania. Thomas Tuchel has made it clear that he wants everybody in his squad to show “respect” at all times.

German tactician Tuchel has previously stated that his mother finds some of Bellingham's on-field antics “repulsive”, with the all-action playmaker often playing with his heart on his sleeve. He finds it difficult to hide his emotions, despite being a polite and softly-spoken individual away from the pitch.

Bellingham has fallen under the spotlight once again after being seen waving his arms around once it became apparent that he was to be replaced by Morgan Rogers late on in England's 2-0 victory over Albania - having already attracted unwelcome attention for swapping shirts at half-time. He was given 84 minutes in that contest, as he made his first start since being brought back into the Three Lions squad by Tuchel.

Many want to see Bellingham retain that passion, but others have been quick to condemn his actions. Ex-England striker Wright believes detractors have nothing better to talk about and are always looking to stick the boot in on someone.

The Arsenal icon posted on social media when speaking out in defence of Bellingham: “They need to create this kind of controversy because there is nothing else to say until the World Cup, so it's going to continue like this until the World Cup.

“They hate the fact that they can't reach him. They hate the fact that they can't negatively influence his club career like they've done with so many others before him. A young man blessed, endowed with overflowing talent and love.”

Tuchel was asked about Bellingham's reaction to being substituted against Albania, telling BBC Radio 5 Live: “I don't want to make more out of it but I stick to my words - 'behaviour is key' and respect towards the team-mates who come in. Decisions are made and you have to accept it as a player.

“Morgan Rogers was for sure not happy when he couldn't start today because he deserves to play for us and he wants to play all the time. We gave him a bit of a rest because he came with a lot of minutes for his club and played against Serbia.”

He went on to say of the incident at his post-match press conference: “I have to review it. I saw he was not happy, I don't want to make it bigger at the moment than it is. My words stand, we are about standards, level and commitment to each other and respect to each other. We will not change or decision just because someone waves their arms.”

Former England defender Conor Coady, who worked alongside Bellingham at the 2022 World Cup, told BBC Sport of the alleged behavioural issues: “When the dust settles Jude will know it was the right decision to bring him off. What it is with Jude, he thinks at the minute he is playing catch-up.

“He missed the last camp, he knows Morgan Rogers has done really well. He wants to play every minute he possibly can to show the manager he can be the main man for England.

“We have seen it tonight with the balls he was losing, he was losing simple balls and trying to be too adventurous at times in his own half. I think he feels he is playing catch-up. Rogers is in a great position.”

The expectation is that Bellingham, given his undoubted ability, will form part of Tuchel's plans at the 2026 World Cup. It is, however, yet to be determined whether he will be awarded a starting berth when another quest for global glory is opened - with the Three Lions having plenty of other creative influences at their disposal.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The ATP Tour season came to a thrilling conclusion on Sunday night at the Nitto ATP Finals, where Jannik Sinner defeated Carlos Alcaraz to lift the trophy in Turin for the second consecutive year.

For the final time this year, ATPTour.com looks at the movers of the week in the PIF ATP Rankings, as of Monday 17 November.




No. 5 Felix Auger-Aliassime, +3 (Career High)
The Canadian has surged into the Top 5 for the first time in his career. Auger-Aliassime earned victories against Ben Shelton and Alexander Zverev at the Nitto ATP Finals to reach the semi-finals.

Auger-Aliassime was at No. 27 in the PIF ATP Rankings in August but held a 21-6 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, since the US Open. The 25-year-old, who married wife Nina in September, advanced to the semis in New York and then the quarter-finals in Shanghai. He won his third title of the season in Brussels and enjoyed a final run at the Rolex Paris Masters.

No. 8 Lorenzo Musetti, +1
Musetti ends the season at No. 8, having started 2025 at No. 17. The Italian earned a dramatic three-set win against Alex de Minaur on home soil in Turin during the round-robin stage. Musetti went 45-22 in 2025, highlighted by his final appearance at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Monte-Carlo.

Cristian Garin joined a six-way tie for a season-leading four Challenger titles on Sunday when he won the Uruguay Open in Montevideo.


The former No. 17 ousted Peru's Ignacio Buse 6-7(3), 6-2, 6-2 in the clay-court final to secure his return to the Top 100 for the first time in 18 months. Buse would have made his Top 100 debut in the PIF ATP Rankings had he triumphed.


But the 29-year-old Garin spoiled Buse's hopes and claimed his eighth Challenger title. His three previous trophies this year came in Mauthausen, Oeiras and on home soil in Antofagasta.

""Proud of the effort and already looking ahead to what's next,"" Garin wrote in an Instagram post reflecting on his 2025 season. ""Thank you to everyone who supported me. See you in '26.""


Garin, seeded fifth in Montevideo, rallied from a set down in his final three matches of the week. After falling to as low as World No. 214 in April, Garin is now in good position to make the Australian Open main draw.

 


Garin was not the only former Top 25 player to triumph on the Challenger circuit this week. German Jan-Lennard Struff lifted his seventh trophy at that level with a title run at the ALL IN OPEN Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes in Lyon.


Struff, who reached a career-high No. 21 in June 2023, downed British qualifier Liam Broady 6-4, 6-4 in the championship match.

Kozlov claims first title since 2021, fittingly at same tournament
American Stefan Kozlov captured his first Challenger title in four years by triumphing at the Paine Schwartz Partners Challenger — the same event he won back in 2021. The 27-year-old saved a match point in his quarter-final against Darwin Blanch and rode that momentum through the final, claiming a 7-6(3), 7-5 victory against former Arizona State University standout Murphy Cassone.

Glinka, 25, becomes third Estonian Challenger champion
Daniil Glinka became the third Estonian player (Mark Lajal, Jurgen Zopp) to win a Challenger title with his maiden title at the Challenger Banque Nationale de Drummondville. The 25-year-old lefty, who beat Canadian wild card Duncan Chan 6-4, 6-2 in the final, is up to a career-high No. 191 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

The Nitto ATP Finals title match between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday became the most-watched tennis broadcast in Italian television history.

Over 6.7 million viewers watched on linear TV alone, with the combined total across linear and digital reaching 7.008 million. Sinner defeated Alcaraz 7-6(4), 7-5 and successfully defended his Turin crown — surpassing the previous national record of 6.6 million set during Sinner's final showdown with Novak Djokovic at the season finale in 2023.

The new benchmark not only underscores Sinner's status as a national sporting icon but also the surging momentum behind tennis viewership in Italy, helped by the likes of fellow stars Lorenzo Musetti, Flavio Cobolli and Luciano Darderi.

Sunday's final was the latest instalment of the fast-growing rivalry between Alcaraz and Sinner, the top two players in the PIF ATP Rankings. It marked their sixth meeting in 2025, which have all come in finals, including in the past three majors.

Christopher Eubanks announced his retirement from tennis on Monday via a post on Instagram.

""If you had told this little boy from the Southside of Atlanta that he would've accomplished all that he did, he wouldn't believe you,"" Eubanks wrote on social media. ""2 Time ACC Player of the Year? Yeah right. Wimbledon Quarter-finalist? No chance. An Olympian? Unfathomable. I was given opportunity to travel around the world and form incredible relationships all while fulfilling a lifelong dream of playing professional tennis. I can't put into words how blessed I have been. Is this absolutely the end?! Tough to say for certain but if it is, WHOOPTY DOO!!! It's been an incredible ride.""

 Even in the midst of a standout 2025 on the ATP Tour, Jannik Sinner and his team knew that improvements were always possible. 

 The Italian crowned his season in style on Sunday night in Turin, where he overcame his great rival Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets to successfully defend his title at the Nitto ATP Finals. A key feature of Sinner's trophy run at the prestigious season finale was his serve, and his coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi later reflected on the recent work they had done with that aspect of the World No. 2's game. 

 “For sure after the US Open we saw some issues, especially with the serve,” said Vagnozzi at Inalpi Arena after Sinner's 7-6(4), 7-5 final triumph. “We changed the motion. We changed the rhythm. He served really well from Shanghai until here. Today in the second set he struggled a little bit. 

 “I think Carlos changed his position on the second serve, changed something on the serve of Jannik also. The second set he started to serve too slow. This also changed the rhythm from the first set. On the serve, we changed a lot of things after the US Open. We are lucky to have Jannik, who is really fast to improve, to understand the changes and everything.”

 Sinner had reached the championship match at all four majors in 2025 prior to the changes Vagnozzi spoke of, lifting the trophies at the Australian Open and Wimbledon, making it somewhat surprising that his coaches felt tweaks were even needed. But Cahill emphasised the need to work on what he called ‘the most important' shot in tennis. 

 “You have control over one shot in tennis, and that is the serve,” said the Australian. “Jannik and Simone have done some incredible work over the last four or five weeks to rejig the serve and find that rhythm and tempo where he has been able to up the first-serve percentage. 

 “It is not just that about the first-serve percentage. If we were really concerned about the first-serve percentage, we would let him slow the serve down to let him get more first serves in. He's actually pumped up the miles per hour, and he is getting the ball closer to the line, which means he gets a lot more free points. They've done a wonderful job with that.” 

Time for a team photo with a special guest 🐶😅 @janniksin | #NittoATPFinals pic.twitter.com/NAoSRQ5xFA

 The results since certainly prove Cahill's theory. After his final defeat to Alcaraz in New York, Sinner lifted ATP 500 titles in Beijing and Vienna, an ATP Masters 1000 crown in Paris, and the Nitto ATP Finals trophy. The 24-year-old has finished his season with a 58-6 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. 

 Sinner's Turin victory against Alcaraz, in which he saved a set point in the first set and rallied from 1-3 to clinch the second, reduced his Lexus ATP Head2Head deficit against the Spaniard to 6-10. Vagnozzi was delighted with the way his charge had held his nerve in front of thousands of adoring home fans. 

 ""It was a really emotional match. Really tight match,” said the coach. “I think both of them, they had periods when they played really good, and sometimes they made some mistakes. We saw Jannik always fighting with a good attitude, with a good face. He always believed, also in the second set when he was a break down, couldn't change the direction of the set. 

 “We are really happy about Jannik's performance. I think there is still something to work on also after this win, the match showed something that we can try to make better. But I'm really happy how we finished the season with unbelievable three tournaments in a row. We are pumped to start next season.”

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

Lando Norris has given an insight into how he is dealing with external noise whilst fighting for a debut World Championship.

Lando Norris has admitted that he feels he “cared too much” about others' perspectives of him in the past, with the McLaren driver suggesting that he has learned to “deal with those things better” as he focuses on having confidence in himself.

After taking victory in the Sao Paulo Grand Prix – a result that saw him extend his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 24 points over team mate Oscar Piastri – Norris was quizzed on how he had found his rhythm at this stage of the season, to which he responded: “Just ignore everyone that talks c**p about you.”

Asked to elaborate on this later – and how he was navigating the external noise that can come with being in a title fight – the Briton stated that it was “nothing in particular” before going to explain his approach.

“There's always people out there that try and bring you down a little bit,” Norris continued. “I guess it's quite normal. But yeah, also, when you're on a big stage, there's a lot of people that talk and say things, try and influence other people to have effects.

“Even the cheers and the not-cheers – you still hear it. It's not the nicest thing. But I think it's something I've done well over the last few months. I care a lot about people's perspectives and how I'm portrayed and things in the media.

“I probably cared too much – even at the beginning of the year, I think I cared too much, and probably it was affecting me in not the best ways.”

Norris went on to detail how he has started to handle those challenges in a way that he finds more effective.

“I've just learned to deal with those things better – not by not caring, because I still always want to have a good impression,” the 26-year-old McLaren racer conceded. “I never want to be rude or do those things. But I'll always try and make my point and say what I believe in.

“That's one of the things I've learned the most: just to be true to yourself, have confidence in yourself, believe in yourself, and speak your mind. So yeah, it's more just keeping my head down and concentrating on myself.”

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

Chris Medland looks ahead to the main storylines ahead of the Las Vegas Grand Prix, the first race of 2025's triple header finale.

The final triple header of the season is upon us, and the Drivers' Championship is set to be decided over the next three weeks. On top of the battle between the top three, there is still plenty to play for elsewhere as we prepare to make our third trip to a Las Vegas track that has delivered exciting racing thus far.

The Mexico City Grand Prix was a dominant performance from Lando Norris, and he followed that with an extremely productive visit to Interlagos. The outright car pace was not as strong compared to the rest of the field as it had been in Mexico, but Norris topped all of the sessions that matter to take pole position and win both the Sprint and the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Coupled with Oscar Piastri crashing out of the Sprint and being limited to fifth place by a penalty in the race on the Sunday, the gap between the two McLaren drivers has now extended to 24 points, meaning Norris can afford to finish second to Piastri in the remaining three races and Qatar Sprint and still win the title.

But Piastri did show signs of progress compared to his previous two weekends, with stronger pace putting him in the mix for second place on both occasions in Brazil, and errors or penalties hurting his chances more than his competitive level.

If Piastri can continue that improvement and have a clean weekend then he will have every chance of fighting with Norris – wherever that may be in the order – and could keep things close heading to the final two rounds.

Drivers' standings after Sao Paulo

It was this very feature ahead of the Sao Paulo Grand Prix that highlighted the need for Max Verstappen to stay in the fight in Brazil to give himself a chance of winning a fifth straight Drivers' title, and the way the weekend panned out showed how much jeopardy there was for his hopes.

Sunday saw a brilliant recovery drive from the Dutchman, but Verstappen still lost points to Norris in both races and now sits 49 adrift in the standings with 83 still to play for.

The equation is pretty simple for Verstappen, who needs a big points swing in his favour in Las Vegas to be in with any kind of realistic chance of winning the title. But stranger things have happened, and it could well be Vegas that offers the opportunity to close in once again.

McLaren have traditionally not been strong in Las Vegas, while Verstappen won here in 2023 and beat Lando Norris to fifth place behind the two Mercedes and Ferrari drivers in 2024. If the form seen on Sunday at Interlagos can be repeated, then Verstappen will likely be in the frame for victory – and if the track conditions don't suit McLaren, he could drag himself back into the championship picture.

One aspect of Las Vegas that could be both a blessing and a curse for Verstappen's hopes is the potential competitiveness of Mercedes.

Last year, Mercedes dominated on the city streets, thriving in the cool conditions to secure a 1-2 finish that saw George Russell cruise to victory from pole position, while Lewis Hamilton had to recover from 10th on the grid to finish second.

It's a performance that has increased expectations on what Toto Wolff's team might be able to achieve this weekend, when it is again expected to be cold.

While Mercedes can still be very competitive at times – as evidenced by Kimi Antonelli's performance as he finished second twice in Brazil, and Russell's two victories so far this year – they also appear to have ironed out some of the car's inconsistencies, creating a bit more of a question mark over whether Las Vegas will suit them as much as last year.

A strong Mercedes would be tough for Verstappen and McLaren to beat, but would also offer the potential for bigger points swings if they are in between the title contenders. When you also include last year's closest challenger, Ferrari – who need a big score after the double DNF at Interlagos hurt their hopes of finishing second in the Teams' Championship – then it feels like a weekend that could have significant ramifications on a number of fronts.

Away from the action in Las Vegas, there have been a number of key milestones for two new teams that are going to be on the grid in 2026.

Ahead of the final triple header of the year, Audi took the opportunity to launch their brand image for next year, displaying the main colours that will make up their livery and identity on a concept car in Munich. The event last week saw iconic Audi racing cars provide a reminder of their motorsport heritage, while the target of fighting for titles from 2030 onwards was also outlined.

The following day, Cadillac were also pushing ahead with important work ahead of their debut in 2026, with a Testing of Previous Car (TPC) outing for Sergio Perez at Imola.

The test was organised in partnership with Ferrari, as Cadillac don't yet have their own machinery that they can use for such running. So a 2023-specification SF-23 was provided, as Ferrari will be supplying Cadillac with power units in their first seasons in the sport.

Perez was able to get back up to speed in F1 machinery after nearly a year out as he prepares for his own return. And while much of the recent focus has been on the end of the current season, both teams are helping build excitement for the sport's new era.

Las Vegas always promised to be a spectacular weekend event from the moment its place on the F1 calendar was confirmed, but at the heart of it, the organisers have provided a track that has encouraged really exciting racing in its first two years.

The inaugural edition in particular was a thriller, with Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc and Sergio Perez fighting it out for victory almost the entire race, with the final order for the top three only decided with two corners to go.

The long straight on Las Vegas Boulevard puts a premium on top speed and low drag, but teams and drivers want downforce from their cars too, in order to be able to put heat into their tyres amid low temperatures at night time in Nevada.

The current forecast for the weekend suggests the race could well take place in single-digit temperatures (in terms of Celsius), making it the coldest race of the year and providing a different challenge for the entire grid to contend with.

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

McLaren will field Ella Lloyd and Ella Stevens in F1 ACADEMY next year, and have added Ella Hakkinen – daughter of two-time Formula 1 World Champion Mika Hakkinen – to their driver roster.

McLaren have announced they are entering a second car into the all-female F1 ACADEMY series for the 2026 season, with Ella Lloyd returning for a second campaign alongside new recruit Ella Stevens.

Lloyd sits third in the 2025 standings with one win and four further podiums ahead of the season finale in Las Vegas. Fellow Briton Stevens recently became the Vice-Champion in the 2025 British KZ2 Karting Championship and is the only woman to win in the UK's premier karting class. In September, she topped the timesheets in the inaugural F1 ACADEMY Rookie Test.

McLaren's added commitment to the series will be delivered in collaboration with long-standing partner NEOM. Both entries will be operated by Rodin Motorsport, with the second McLaren Racing entry, piloted by 19-year-old Stevens, known as F1 ACADEMY McLaren Oxagon.

In addition, Ella Hakkinen, daughter of two-time F1 World Champion Mika Hakkinen, has joined the McLaren Driver Development Programme. The 14-year-old, who is one of nine karters supported by F1 ACADEMY DISCOVER YOUR DRIVE in the Champions of the Future Academy Program, has become the youngest talent in their junior roster and will be testing single-seaters in preparation for 2027.

Zak Brown, CEO of McLaren Racing, said: “While I recognise that more remains to be done to increase female representation in motorsport, I'm immensely proud of the progress we've made in this space.

“I hope this signals to all the amazingly talented female karters, drivers, engineers, mechanics, marketeers and accountants out there that our sport is open to all and deeply committed to keeping up the incredible momentum we have seen over the past few years.

“There are so many opportunities both at and away from track and I want to thank NEOM for partnering with us in this space to help us open more pathways for women.

“To now have three talented young female drivers in our Driver Development Programme is really exciting, and I cannot wait to see them hit the track.”

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

As he prepares for his 2026 return to the grid, Sergio Perez speaks to F1.com's Lawrence Barretto about how he benefitted from his break after leaving Red Bull, and his hopes for his and Cadillac's maiden season together.

Sergio Perez is back – in more ways than one. Yes, he's got himself a seat on the Formula 1 grid in 2026 with Cadillac after a year on the sidelines, but more importantly for the Mexican, he's got his spark back after a tumultuous and confidence-sapping final year with Red Bull.

Perez was riding the crest of a wave at the end of 2023 after scoring a career-best runner-up spot in the Drivers' standings, which helped Red Bull defend their Constructors' Championship title – and just a few months into 2024, he signed a new deal that would extend his stay at Red Bull to six years.

However, his form tailed off dramatically (he scored just nine points in the last eight Grand Prix weekends) and that culminated in an agreement with Red Bull to go their separate ways at the end of the campaign, despite Perez still having two further seasons on his contract.

That campaign took a toll on Perez, the Mexican leaving the sport on a low note, and not on his terms. He felt a little lost, which is understandable given this was the first time he wouldn't be racing full time for the best part of two decades – but the break has turned out to be a good thing.

""I didn't feel at the time [but I needed the break],"" Perez told me when we chatted at Cadillac's Silverstone base ahead of his first seat fit with the team. ""When you are in the sport, you are carried away with the fact that you are always thinking about your next year, your next race, your next contract.

""It's like you are in automatic mode. But once you are forced to step out of it like I was, you realise a lot of things and you see the sport different.""

Does it feel like he's fallen back in love with F1 again? ""Yeah, definitely,” says Perez, who cut a super relaxed figure throughout our chat. “You have to remember that my last six months at Red Bull were very difficult for myself in all areas.

""I started to have a bit of demotivation with the sport and I cannot let that happen because this is a sport that gave me everything.

""The day that I leave the sport, I want to leave it with a big smile and a lot of respect because the sport has given me everything.""

Initially, Perez wasn't sure what he was going to do when he left F1 but after some time out, he realised he wasn't done with it yet – and that triggered talks with multiple teams about a seat on the grid for 2026.

""In the beginning, the first couple of months were great,"" said Perez. ""I realised that I missed [F1] because I kept following it. I kept waking up for the races.

""I could see what was happening – I was talking to friends that were in the paddock, and I realised that probably I missed it more than I thought.

""And then when the conversation started with Cadillac and we could see that passion for racing, then, yeah, I felt like I still have something left in me.""

Cadillac soon became the frontrunner to get his signature, with the American team offering Perez the kind of project that he wanted to get stuck into for what he feels will be his final hurrah in the sport.

""It feels great,"" said Perez, who has raced for Sauber, McLaren, Force India/Racing Point and Red Bull. ""Now that I look back, it was like a dream scenario, being able to take a year out and then get that refreshment.

""After 15 years or so in Formula 1 to get that refreshment and then have all the energy again for what I see as my final stint in the sport... I have all the energy now to get back to it, to work with the team, to push the team forwards in all areas, on the simulator. It's a new team so we're starting basically from zero.”

The biggest lesson Perez has taken from the break is to try and live more in the moment when he gets back on the grid, and to enjoy what he is doing – something he realises he didn't do enough of in his first stint.

""When you are in that bubble of Formula 1 – because at the end of the day, Formula 1 is a bubble – as a driver you worry about a lot of factors,"" he said.

""You are not always satisfied because you didn't take the extra time that was in there and so on and you forget that the main thing is to enjoy it, because at the end of the day, we are privileged to be able to do what we love.

""That to me was like the biggest lesson: that you have to enjoy the sport because we are so competitive and we are so focused on giving our maximum that you forget to enjoy it.""

Perez is aware of the challenges that lie ahead for Cadillac as a new team entering the sport in 2026, when sweeping new chassis and power unit rules will be introduced. But he takes heart from the immense amount of experience the team already has – staff having joined from a variety of rival teams on the grid – and the huge amount of investment General Motors are committing.

“I think one thing is getting everything ready for Melbourne, but the other thing is to get it ready and competitive, which we are all pushing for,” said Perez. “Having all that experience around us really helps us a lot.

“You see a lot of familiar faces, people that have been in the paddock for a lot longer than I've been there, a lot of experience with a will to prove themselves in the sport.”

Since signing the deal with Cadillac in the summer, Perez has embedded himself in his new team and used his immense experience in F1 to get stuck in in meetings.

He's done a lot of simulator work already, too, with more planned and this week completed his first run in F1 machinery for nearly two years when he tested a 2023-spec Ferrari.

“It's been good being backwards and forwards with the team,” said Perez. “I've been pushing on some certain areas, giving some direction. It's great to have a team that you feel that you can influence and you can ask for certain things.”

Cadillac have entered F1 to fight at the sharp end – but they know that they have a steep climb to get there. With that in mind, Perez is realistic but optimistic about his ambitions for their first season together.

“To me, it's a bit irrelevant where we start,” said Perez. “What is more important is how quickly we are able to progress. I want to push the team forward from day one. I think we will be able to surprise a lot of people. That's a target for us, to be able to have a strong impact in Formula 1 since day one.”

And there's a little bit extra riding on it as for Perez, he knows this is his last dance in F1 and he wants to finish it his way. “I see this as my main, big, final project in the sport and I want to make sure that I make it a successful comeback,” he said.

Disney releases director Thomas Kail's film in theaters next summer.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


	Catherine Laga'aia and Dwayne Johnson are set to make a splash with the first trailer for Disney‘s live-action feature adaptation of Moana.


	Director Thomas Kail's remake of the original 2016 animated film hits theaters July 10, 2026. The trailer includes Laga'aia's title character performing the song “How Far I'll Go,” which was feature in the initial movie.




	Rounding out the cast are John Tui as Moana's father, Chief Tui; Frankie Adams as Moana's mother, Sina; and Rena Owen as Moana's Gramma Tala.

	The Moana trailer offers the first look at the denizens of Motunui, Johnson's shape-shifting demigod Maui and the intimidating tribe of Kakamora. Moana centers on wayfinder Moana (Laga'aia) venturing beyond her island of Motunui with the help of Maui (Johnson) in an attempt to save her people.

	Kail helmed the live-action movie from a script by Jared Bush and Dana Ledoux Miller. Johnson, Beau Flynn, Dany Garcia, Hiram Garcia and Lin-Manuel Miranda serve as producers. Executive producing are Kail, Scott Sheldon, Charles Newirth and Auli'i Cravalho, who voiced Moana in the 2016 film and its 2024 theatrical sequel. 


	Johnson originated the role of Maui in directors John Musker and Ron Clements' 2016 animated Moana opposite Cravalho as the title character. Temuera Morrison, Nicole Scherzinger and Rachel House rounded out the voice cast for the film that collected $643 million at the global box office ($870 million today). Miranda earned an Oscar nomination for the original song “How Far I'll Go,” and the movie was also nominated for best animated feature.

	











	Live-action remakes of popular animated properties continue to be a priority for Disney. The studio recently put a new version of 2010's Tangled back in development after it was paused earlier this year following Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot's live-action Snow White underperforming at the box office. Disney had a massive summer hit with the live-action remake of Lilo & Stitch, while Barry Jenkins' prequel movie Mufasa: The Lion King also had a strong showing when it debuted late last year.

The actor is set to appear on a special episode of Netflix's 'My Next Guest Needs No Introduction.'


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Adam Sandler is dredging up some cringeworthy memories while visiting David Letterman‘s Emmy-winning Netflix series.


My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman returns for a special episode featuring a conversation with Adam Sandler that begins streaming Dec. 1. The series has been picked up through season seven and is set to launch its sixth season later in December.




	Sandler will discuss his trajectory from stand-up comedy to Saturday Night Live to leading an array of popular films. The actor has earned acclaim for his role opposite George Clooney in director Noah Baumbach's Jay Kelly, which is set to hit the streamer Dec. 5.

	“I did this one show in Boston, and my dad and brother came to see it, and I ate it so hard in front of my dad, and I hated that,” Sandler tells Letterman in a preview clip about his early years as a teenage stand-up comic. 


	Sandler went on to recall the awkward moment right after he had left the stage: “I turn around, and the emcee goes — and I was 17 — he says, ‘Were you the class clown in school?' And I go, ‘Yeah.' And he goes, ‘Stick with that.' And the place goes (loud cheers).”


My Next Guest Needs No Introduction has earned seven Emmy nominations, including a win for best hosted nonfiction series or special in 2024. Previous guests have included Barack Obama, Volodymyr Zelensky, Tina Fey, Miley Cyrus, Robert Downey Jr., Dave Chappelle and Billie Eilish.

	











	The series hails from Jax Media and Worldwide Pants, Inc., and producers include Tommy Alter, John Nemeth and Hunter Speese for Jax Media/Imagine Entertainment. Executive producing are Tom Keaney and Mary Barclay for Worldwide Pants, alongside Justin Wilkes, Michael Steed, Isabel Richardson and Yolanda T. Cochran for Jax Media/Imagine Entertainment. Producers are Tommy Alter, John Nemeth and Hunter Speese for Jax Media/Imagine Entertainment. Steed directed the special episode.


	Sandler has a longstanding relationship with Netflix. His comedy feature Happy Gilmore 2 set an opening weekend record when it debuted on the streamer earlier this year.


	“We couldn't be happier,” Sandler previously told The Hollywood Reporter about the response to Happy Gilmore 2. “It's something that I can't describe. Just walking down the street, hearing people talk about it even before it came out — we were like, something fun is going on here.”

The movie is now the top-grossing international film ever at the North American box office, supplanting longtime record holder 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


Sony and Crunchyroll's anime sensation Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle continues to burn bright at the global box office. The smash-hit animated fantasy opened in China over the weekend, earning a strong $52.4 million from Friday to Sunday and lifting its worldwide total to a staggering $730 million. Released locally by Maoyan, the film's word-of-mouth has been overwhelmingly positive despite the recent flare-up in geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Tokyo that has been widely covered in Chinese state media.


Infinity Castle beat out Lionsgate's Now You See Me: Now You Don't, which opened in second place with a respectable $21.6 million. Local crime drama Family at Large, starring Hu Ge and produced by Hehe Pictures, launched in third place with $1.9 million over Saturday and Sunday, according to data from Artisan Gateway.

Infinity Castle has already notched several major box office records: It ranks as the fifth-biggest global release of 2025, the top Japanese movie of all time at the worldwide box office and the highest-grossing international film ever in North America (supplanting longtime record holder Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon).


Infinity Castle was especially powerful on Imax screens during its first weekend in China. It opened to $11.5 million in the giant-screen format, representing 25 percent of the nationwide total. The anime juggernaut also delivered the biggest Imax opening weekend ever for a Japanese feature in China, while additionally notching the second-largest Imax debut for an animated film in the country, behind only 2025's current global box office champ, Ne Zha 2.

	











Demon Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba) originates from the wildly popular manga by Japanese artist Koyoharu Gotouge. Following the debut of its first TV anime adaptation in 2019, the property swiftly became one of Japan's most beloved pop culture exports. The story centers on Tanjiro Kamado, a kindhearted boy who becomes a “demon slayer” after his family is murdered and his younger sister Nezuko is transformed into a demon. With lavish animation from Tokyo studio Ufotable and an emotionally charged blend of family bonds, heroism and dark fantasy, the franchise soared to new heights with its first feature film, Mugen Train, which grossed more than $500 million worldwide in 2020 — an impressive feat at a time when the theatrical business was still heavily challenged by the pandemic.


	In contrast to the fading appeal of Hollywood imports, Japanese anime has remained a consistent powerhouse at the Chinese box office. Over the past several years, Japanese animated features such as Suzume, The First Slam Dunk and Spy x Family Code: White have routinely outperformed big-budget U.S. studio releases, buoyed by China's version of the same young, online-savvy audience that has made anime a blockbuster content category worldwide in recent years.


Infinity Castle is the first installment in a planned trilogy adapting the “Final Battle” arc that concludes the Demon Slayer saga — a strong start that underscores Sony's long-game approach to building a global anime pipeline. Analysts have viewed Demon Slayer‘s success as clear validation of the company's investment in its Crunchyroll anime division, which has evolved from a niche streaming platform into a key pillar of Sony's content ecosystem. The anime business has become a cornerstone of Sony's broader effort to leverage Japan's most popular cultural exports — including gaming IP and anime — into consistent global box office results.

Plus, the Spanish superstar gives Jimmy Fallon a flamenco singing lesson while celebrating the success of LUX.

Rosalía appeared on The Tonight Show on Sunday night (Nov. 16) to deliver a captivating rendition of “La Perla,” drawn from her latest album, LUX, originally featuring Yahritza y Su Esencia, who were not present for the performance.

	The Spanish superstar stunned as she brought a literal fairytale to life with dreamlike precision. Wearing a shoulderless pearlesque gown — fluffy and ethereal like a ballerina — she commanded the stage with her signature blend of softness and power. Her honeyed yet striking vocals took center stage, weaving through orchestral accompaniment heavy on violins. Her artistry was enhanced by her bold look: bleached hair at the crown subtly evoked the image of a glowing halo, adding a celestial feel to her performance.

	As the camera slowly widened its frame, the scene revealed Rosalía perched atop a towering stack of lilac-sheeted mattresses, a nod to the whimsical tale of The Princess and the Pea. The performance reached its crescendo when she descended from the mattresses, carried by two men, and pulled out a monumental pearl.




	Her charm extended beyond her show, as Rosalía led an impromptu lesson teaching Fallon how to vocalize and clap flamenco-style during an interview segment. “You have to stand up… your posture is important,” Rosalía explained, before guiding Fallon through body loosening exercises and lip flutters. Fallon struggled, in a playful manner, through the complexities of singing a line from “La Perla” in Spanish, but the Catalonian artist encouraged him warmly while demonstrating her effortless control over melody.


	In the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200, Rosalía earns her first top 10 with the No. 4 debut of LUX.

The track will feature on a new physical edition of the Is This What We Want? LP.


													By
												

	Thomas Smith



Paul McCartney will contribute a ‘silent' track to a compilation album that is protesting the U.K. government's recent changes to copyright law.


	The LP Is This What We Want? was first released digitally in February and was co-signed by over a thousand U.K. artists. The LP runs for 47 minutes, and features the silence of an empty recording studio in order to highlight the need for human musicians in the age of artificial intelligence. The album's track listing spells out the message: “The British government must not legalize music theft to benefit AI companies.”

Taylor Mims 













Kate Bush, Annie Lennox, Damon Albarn, Billy Ocean, Radiohead's Ed O'Brien, and more were all credited as ‘co-writers' of the LP. Upon release, it reached No. 38 on the U.K.'s Official Albums Chart.


	McCartney's contribution will appear as a bonus track to the physical edition of the LP, which will be released on Dec. 8 via record label The state51 Conspiracy. The vinyl is available for pre-order here, with all profits from sales to be donated to the musicians' charity Help Musicians. 


	It's not the first time that McCartney has protested against the U.K. government's controversial approach to copyright law in the era of artificial intelligence. In May, McCartney was among 400 British musicians alongside Elton John, Dua Lipa, and Coldplay, to sign an open letter calling on U.K. prime minister Sir Keir Starmer to update copyright laws to protect their work from AI training models. They were backed by industry heavyweights Sir Lucian Grainge (Universal Music Group CEO), Jason Iley MBE (Sony Music UK CEO), and Dickon Stainer (Universal Music UK CEO) who also signed the letter.


	The U.K. government proposed an ‘opt out' approach for rightsholders in relation to their work being used to train artificial intelligence models. Critics say that the burden should not fall on artists to approve or deny tech companies the use their material, and that ‘opt out' models are unenforceable.


	During the summer, the U.K. government was involved in a ‘ping pong' debacle whereby amendments to the Data (Use and Access) Bill proposed by the House of Lords were rejected five times. The amendments would have given rightsholders visibility over when their work was being used against their wishes by AI companies. The bill eventually passed and received Royal Assent in late June, and is expected to be be phased into law by mid-2026.


	Ed Newton-Rex, the organizer of the album, said: “The government must commit to not handing the life's work of the country's musicians to AI companies for free. Doing so would be hugely damaging to our world-leading creative industries, and is totally unnecessary, only benefiting overseas tech giants. It should listen to Paul McCartney and the 1,000 other musicians who took part in this album, and resist calls to legalize music theft from the big tech lobby.”

Lorde gave Sadie Sink the “Green Light” to absolutely let it rip during the singer's show at the London O2 Arena on Sunday night (Nov. 16). The Stranger Things star was a surprise special guest during the first of two shows at the arena on Lorde's ongoing Ultrasound world tour in support of her fourth album, Virgin.


Check out video of the moment where the two women jam out like everyone is looking — bouncing around and flipping their hair, holding hands and shouting the lyrics to the ebullient lead single from Lorde's 2017 sophomore album Melodrama. As the stage is bathed in, duh, green light, the pair let loose and dance without inhibition, with Lorde shouting “get the f–k up!” at one point as the party rages on, ending with them sharing a sweet hug at the end.

	











	The surprise get together is not completely out of the blue. Sink recently starred in the Tony-nominated Broadway play John Proctor Is the Villain, which NME pointed out prominently features “Green Light.” Speaking to Vogue in June about the song's use in the play about a group of Appalachian students in Georgia reading Arthur Miller's The Crucible in the midst of the #MeToo movement, Sink revealed that she's a Lorde superfan.




	“Oh my God, I'm a huge Lorde fan. I'm so excited for the new album,” Sink said at the time. “Solar Power was such an important album for me. To follow an artist through her many different eras…she really was that person for me.” Lorde returned the favor, going to see the show on Broadway in July.


	Lorde will play the O2 again on Monday night (Nov. 17), with the European leg of her tour running through a Dec. 9 date in Stockholm before winding down for the year on Dec. 16-17 with a double-down at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. She will pick up again in February with a run of dates in Australia and New Zealand. 


	In addition, Lorde has just been announced as a headliner for next year's All Points East festival at London's Victoria Park on Aug. 22, where she will perform alongside PinkPantheress, Zara Larsson and others.

Donald Trump‘s reversal on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files may have been accepting the inevitable, a House vote this week that otherwise would see rank-and-file GOP break with the president on a vote to compel such a disclosure.


	But even if the House vote, expected Tuesday, is overwhelming, that doesn't mean that the files will be released. The Senate must take up the matter and, if it passes, it will go to Trump's desk for his signature. 


	What's being watched is whether the House support for releasing the files is enough to overcome a presidential veto.

					John Oliver On Trump Mentions In Epstein Emails: ""Even The Guy Running The Pervert Express To Crime Island Thinks That You Are A D---""		
			








	On Sunday, Trump posted on Truth Social, “As I said on Friday night aboard Air Force One to the Fake News Media, House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown.'”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	House Speaker Mike Johnson has been resistant to a House vote, and even delayed the swearing in of a Democrat, Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, until last week. She provided the 218th vote on a discharge petition to bring the Epstein files vote to the House floor. Hours before that, the White House made a last-ditch effort to convince one Republican, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), to take her name off that discharge petition, which would have scuttled the effort.


	Trump also called on the Justice Department to investigate Democrats who were named in the trove of Epstein emails released by the House Oversight Committee, and Attorney General Pam Bondi quickly assigned a prosecutor to look into it. But Trump himself is named in the emails more than 1,000 times, per the Miami Herald. An ongoing DOJ investigation also raises the prospect that prosecutors will cite the ongoing probe as a reason to withhold files. 

	











	With Trump's reversal, some lawmakers pressed Trump to order the release of the files without the congressional vote. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) wrote on X, “The vote is to compel YOU to release them. Let's make this easier. Just release the files now.”


	Trump, meanwhile, continued to warn Republicans on the Epstein saga. In the latter part of his Truth Social post, he wrote, “Nobody cared about Jeffrey Epstein when he was alive and, if the Democrats had anything, they would have released it before our Landslide Election Victory. Some ‘members' of the Republican Party are being ‘used,' and we can't let that happen. Let's start talking about the Republican Party's Record Setting Achievements, and not fall into the Epstein ‘TRAP,' which is actually a curse on the Democrats, not us.”


	Later, he also again slammed Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who supports the release of the files and in recent weeks has been critical of the administration. 


	He wrote, “Wacky Marjorie ‘Traitor' Brown (Remember, Green turns to Brown where there is ROT involved!) is working overtime to try and portray herself as a victim when, in actuality, she is the cause of all of her own problems. The fact is, nobody cares about this Traitor to our Country!”


	Trump withdrew his endorsement of Greene on Friday. She has said that she and her family have faced threats and “hoax pizza deliveries.” 


	She wrote on X, “President Trump's unwarranted and vicious attacks against me were a dog whistle to dangerous radicals that could lead to serious attacks on me and my family. Unfortunately, I've been down this road before. As a matter of fact, as I campaigned all over the country and defended President Trump, I received dozens of swatting calls on my house and my family members homes along with these hoax pizza deliveries, but even more severely I have received some of the most death threats of any Member of Congress that led to multiple men being convicted and serving time in prison.”

After the FBI redacts all references to Trump, the Epstein files will be 10 words long.

GOP=Chaos Is Our Brand

Genuine question: Is there actually someone neutral overseeing these files, so they are not being edited to anyones favor!??

Fawn Hall.

If he now supports their release, it must mean Stephen Miller has finished with scrubbing all references to Trump.

Guess they finished redacting Trump's name out of the files.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


Daisy Ridley (Star Wars) is set to star in action-thriller The Good Samaritan for Taken and Peppermint director Pierre Morel, we can reveal. 


	The film is based on an original screenplay from Rambo: First Blood screenwriter Matthew Ian Cirulnick. 


	The synopsis reads: “When successful entrepreneur Dr. Rosalind Carver (Ridley) and her husband Matt rescue a wounded man drifting off the coast of Indonesia, they believe they're saving a life – not stepping into a deadly conspiracy. Within hours, their yacht vanishes, Matt is abducted, and paradise turns into a trap. Hunted by pirates and imprisoned by corrupt officials, Rosalind's only hope lies in Sean Fuller, a private military contractor whose motives are as mysterious as his past. Together, they must navigate a maze of deceit and violence in a land where no one can be trusted.” Production is being lined up for spring 2026 in Brisbane, Australia on the Gold Coast.

					By Dade Hayes 

Business Editor


	Major local TV station owner Sinclair Inc. says it has been conducting merger talks for several months with rival E.W. Scripps.


	In an SEC filing, the company said it had acquired 8% of Scripps Class A shares in the open market for $15.6 million.


	Sinclair says a deal could be completed in nine to 12 months.


	Scripps, whose market value is about $277 million, operates 60 local stations in 40 markets, ranking No. 9 on trade group BIA's annual rankings. It also owns the Ion broadcast network and multicast networks like Court TV, Bounce and Grit and is known for its annual spelling bee, which marked its 100th anniversary last summer. Ion has acquired rights to the WNBA and other women's sports.

					Canada's Bell Media Confirms Investment In Blink49 Studios		
			








	Like another proposed transaction in the local TV sector, Nexstar's pending $6.2 billion bid to acquire Tegna, a Sinclair-Scripps combination would require a change to federal rules limiting station ownership. The FCC currently will not allow ownership of stations reaching 39% of U.S. households, but Donald Trump's appointed chair of the regulatory agency has voiced strong support for lifting the cap. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Stations say they are unfairly restrained at a time when tech giants face no similar limits to their reach in media, an argument echoed by FCC Chair Brendan Carr. Critics of the consolidation say it will ultimately reduce the amount of local TV news voices, putting the local TV business on the trajectory followed by the newspaper and radio industries before it.

	











	Even if the FCC moves to lift the cap, there is debate about whether Congress would need to get involved. Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the regulatory body, has said the FCC does not have the power to unilaterally change ownership rules.


	Sinclair's filing said the merger “would be structured to require no external financing as the combined company would maintain each company's respective debt and preferred capital structures. As a result, the transaction would avoid significant refinancing costs while meaningfully reducing the Issuer's leverage through the realization of synergies and lowering future refinancing risk.”


	It pegged the annual synergies at $300 million.


	Sinclair, like Nexstar, is championing the consolidation move as a way of preserving its “vital public service role in producing local news.” The two top players in local TV both gained notice this year when they pulled Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show off their stations, forcing ABC to suspend him in the wake of comments he made about the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.


	Consolidation and “intensifying competition,” Sinclair said in the filing, proves that “further scale in the broadcast television industry is essential to address secular headwinds and compete effectively with larger-scale big-tech and big-media players, as well as major broadcast groups.”

Pierce Brosnan has raised the prospect of Doctor Fate appearing in Man of Tomorrow, the follow-up to James Gunn‘s DC Studios reboot Superman.


	In an interview with GQ, Brosnan said he was open to playing Kent Nelson, aka Doctor Fate, after inhabiting the role in the ill-fated 2022 movie Black Adam, starring Dwayne Johnson.


	“I've heard that Doctor Fate was going to have his own show, or his own movie. I've heard that he's going to be in the next Superman,” the Irish actor said.


	Asked if he would consider playing Doctor Fate again, the former James Bond star responded: “I enjoyed that, the philosophy of that character, very much, and I would definitely be open to it.”

	Gunn announced in September that Man of Tomorrow will bow on July 9, 2027, with David Corenswet and Nicholas Hoult expected to return as Superman/Clark Kent and Lex Luthor.


	Little else is known about the blockbuster, but Gunn has already hinted at a role for Doctor Fate in his reset of the DC universe through a Hall of Justice mural in Superman.


	“I think Doctor Fate's in there,” Gunn told the Happy, Sad, Confused podcast. In another interview with Rolling Stone, the director added that a “ton of thought” went into the mural.


	Asked by Rolling Stone if there are plans for all the characters featured, Gunn said: “Not necessarily specifically see all of them, but yes, some of them we already have in the works in different things in different ways.”


	DC already has its Supergirl bowing on June 26, 2026. The studio is also set to go into production on Clayface, which is set to bow on September 11, 2026.


Superman was considered the reset of the DC Cinematic Universe, with Gunn, the co-head of DC Studios with Peter Safran, also writing the screenplay based on the characters created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. 


	It hit theaters July 11 and opened to $125M at the domestic box office, eventually becoming the first DC movie to cross the $300M mark at the domestic box office since 2022's The Batman.

I really enjoyed this Superman,  and I originally was leaning into not liking it,  as the promo pictures I was seeing,  I thought that he looked more “mafiosi” than “Kansas corn-bred”, but I enjoyed seeing the interplay with some of the “Justice Gang”, and let's face it, Krypto stole the show throughout the movie!

As a lifelong Superman fan, I was incredibly disappointed with Gunn's iteration. Superman is not Guardians of the Galaxy. Goofy jokes, endless silliness, weightless CGI instead of practical effects, a stupid song over the end credits instead of the theme music, a dumb post credits scene, these don't belong in Superman.

The only Superman movies that got it right are Richard Donner's original, his cut of Superman II, and Richard Lester's Superman II. Three good movies in 47 years is really woeful. 

With Gunn in charge of DC, we're just going to get more of this junk. 

Superman RIP

Mark my words, you'll see a lot more fighters take these opportunities in the future. I'm about to break the internet over Jake Paul's face.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Anya Taylor-Joy is angelic in mask-free Margiela at Governors Awards 2025: ‘No one show this to Kim K'","https://pagesix.com/2025/11/17/style/anya-taylor-joy-wears-sheer-white-margiela-couture-gown-sans-mask-at-governors-awards-2025/","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:09:00 GMT","

Anya Taylor-Joy looked truly ethereal at the 2025 Governors Awards.

Wearing a sheer white Maison Margiela Couture gown, Taylor-Joy's dress featured a corseted waistline, a weightless, cascading skirt and a cape-like train that fell off her shoulders.

To accessorize, she wore jewelry by Tiffany & Co.: a necklace with Akoya pearls and diamonds, diamond drop earrings, the Soleste diamond ring and the new Birds on a Rock Wings ring.

The gown was originally presented during the design house's fall 2025 couture runway this past summer. On the runway, the model also wore a white face covering that matched the look to walk in the show.

In fact, every single look in the show featured a face-covering, making Creative Director Glenn Martens' Margiela debut more about the artistry of the clothing than the people who wear it.  

Taylor-Joy isn't the first person to wear a gown from this collection; Kim Kardashian made headlines wearing a similar version to the 2025 Academy Museum Gala just a month ago.

While Kardashian slipped into the nude-toned strapless version from the collection, she did opt for the matching face covering that walked the runway, causing her glam team to “silently cry” after perfecting hair and makeup that would go unseen.

Kardashian is no stranger to wearing a face covering. She also committed to the look for the 2021 Met Gala, during which she wore a masked Balenciaga ensemble.

Taylor-Joy, however, kept her beauty look simple with center-parted hair cascading down her back and minimal, natural makeup.

Though the actress has yet to post the outfit on Instagram, a photo was shared on @checkthetag, with one commenter hysterically noting, “No one show this to Kim K.”

Others focused on Taylor-Joy's other worldly air, writing, “This looks so dreamy on her,” “She is an angel!” and “THIS is how you wear the new Margiela couture! Ethereal and fairy-like.”

The wide-eyed blond actress gives off angelic vibes regardless of what she's wearing — this latest look just made it even more apparent — just add a halo and wings.

The 2026 Met Gala is putting bodies back into fashion.

On Monday, the Metropolitan Museum of Art revealed the theme for its spring exhibition and star-studded fundraiser: “Costume Art,” set to examine “the centrality of the dressed body.”

The show will pair approximately 200 garments and accessories with 200 artworks spanning from Western prehistory to the present day to explore how fashion and flesh have shaped one another throughout the ages.

“Rather than prioritizing fashion's visuality, which often comes at the expense of the corporeal, ‘Costume Art' privileges its materiality and the indivisible connection between our bodies and the clothes we wear,” Bolton said in the release.

One example: a 1504 Albrecht Dürer print depicting Adam and Eve displayed next to Walter Van Beirendonck's 2009 spandex bodysuits inspired by the prelapsarian pair.

The works will be organized into thematic body types that reflect their “ubiquity and endurance through time and space,” according to the release. These include categories like “the Naked Body,” “the Classical Body,” “the Pregnant Body” and “the Mortal Body.”

In its announcement detailing the theme, Vogue included a glimpse of several of the garments set to be featured, including Georgina Godley's rounded “Pregnancy” dress and a 2017 Comme des Garçons look with exaggerated, sculptural curves.

The exhibition opens May 10 and runs through Jan. 10, 2027, inaugurating the museum's new 12,000-square-foot Condé M. Nast Galleries. 

The Met Gala, which funds the majority of the Costume Institute's operations, will be held on May 4.

Jeff Bezos, 61, and wife Lauren Sánchez, 55, are serving as lead sponsors after skipping this year's “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” gala to plan their lavish June wedding in Venice. The couple made their Met debut in 2024, with Sánchez dressed in Oscar de la Renta.

“Superfine” is the museum's first exhibition specifically focused on Black American style and the first to highlight menswear since 2003. The gala, co-chaired by Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams and Anna Wintour, raised a record $31 million for the Costume Institute.

Celebrity co-chairs for the 2026 gala will be announced in the coming months.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Loneliness washes over a lesser The Chair Company","https://www.avclub.com/the-chair-company-recap-season-1-episode-6","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 04:40:00 GMT","

To pick up a thread from last week's The Chair Company recap: If there's anything that bonds Fisher Robay CEO Jeff Levjman, Canton Marketplace at Bear Run lead Ron Trosper, and low-level hood Mike Santini, it's loneliness. For Ron and Mike, it's been apparent from the start: Ron sealed off in his home office or office office, conducting frantic Google searches; or Mike shining his shoes in a sad bachelor apartment where the obscenities of Wazy Wayne's mingle with his neighbors' blood-curdling screams. In “Happy Birthday, A Friend,” we see further evidence of this in the way new workplace stress puts more distance between Ron and his family or the heartfelt (if incredibly silly) note Mike writes in a birthday card.

But we're getting our first true look at Jeff's isolation this week. We sense it during the gathering in the cold open, when the camera separates him from fellow jagoff executives who include a dead ringer for dead software mogul/occasional presidential hopeful/frequent fugitive John McAfee and a guy with the heinous bowl cut of Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis. And it carries over to the rest of the episode—which, to me, is a bit of a step down from the delirious heights of “I Won. Zoom In.”—as an emboldened Jeff cuts a bewildering, lone-wolf path across the Canton Marketplace project.

He tells Ron and Brenda to scrap their current layout, without any clear instructions or coherent requests for what he'd like to see next. He, bafflingly and hilariously, presents Zillow-worthy photographs from his trip to Sedona as a blueprint for a new design. While overworked colleagues crowd together to brainstorm ideas that will satisfy their mad king, Jeff invites himself to Seth's birthday party, hoping to bounce some ideas around with a more “relaxed” Ron. He arrives and leaves alone, disappointed that the gathering is “kinda like a kid's party.” 

It's maybe the first time I've seen this sort of corporate brainrot parodied so precisely on TV—a more banal variation on the Succession or Silicon Valley thing of mistaking wealth and a place in the C-suite for intelligence and wide-ranging expertise. If you've ever worked for someone like this, it's worth a knowing snicker: You've been in Ron's shoes, and his frustrations are familiar. With the McAfee guy's taunt about “boxes” burrowing under his skin, Jeff invents a bunch of problems. Naturally, he, and he alone, knows the solutions.

And that's the operative term: alone. Like Mike in the store, staring at that chocolate King Kong and wondering who he could give it to (so sad, so funny). Like Ron at the  end of “Happy Birthday, A Friend,” all by himself in a crowded room (of chairs). 

That shot, widening in time with Tim Robinson's dopey grin to reveal row after row of Teccas, is the defining image of the episode. But the one that encapsulates The Chair Company so far comes earlier, when Jeff comes out of the house while Ron is trying in vain to shoo away Mike. Slightly hunched over, awkwardly craning his neck, he's trapped between the two lonely men helping Ron to make his life a living hell: The one he thought he could be, pre-chair, and the one he's in danger of becoming, post-chair.   

It's a tug-of-war that's all over “Happy Birthday, A Friend.” We see it in the hectic, Pere Ubu-backed montage of tense days and nights at Fisher Robay and in Ron's explosion at the trespassing R/C enthusiasts that leads to his physical confrontation with Jeff. The inserts of the fight with the dented forehead guy and the barrage of photos and footage timed to the machine-gun breakdown in “Life Stinks” are a touch literal, but the point stands: Between his investment in exposing Tecca and Jeff's unreasonable demands, Ron is coming apart at the seams. 

Though this episode begins with more garden-variety strangeness like chasing the headphones guy out of life-of-the-party class and a stilted, monitored coffee break with Amanda, the workplace disruptions and the stuff going on at home gets weirder as the pressures on Ron mount. Mind you, this is different from saying we're seeing these things because he's getting more stressed out. Storytelling-wise, I feel like the escalation from “Dr. Stevens moved into the office” to “credible proof that a co-worker has a screwdriver in her abdominal cavity” runs in tandem with the increased tension. Those kinds of gags aren't always as seamlessly blended into the narrative as they were in “I Won. Zoom In,” but they're still pretty funny. I got a big laugh out of the guy putting the birthday cake on top of Seth's puke and declaring, “It's fine. It's covered.”

Punctuating too many scenes like that takes some of the unpredictability out of The Chair Company, though it's restored in the final sequence at the “'50s Cop Hop.” Amid the doo-wop, carnival rides, and omnipresent police officers, the paranoia and suspense of a big-time thriller set piece intersects with the surreality of Ron potentially getting busted by somebody wearing Halloween-store nerd and Elvis accessories on top of their uniform. I admire the episode's reverie of a climax, with its maze of connecting rooms and woozy audio/visual presentation. The exterminator's hunch paying off is a dream come true for Ron at the end of a nightmare made up of Jeff's meddling, Mike's clinginess, and threatening phone calls from some unknown entity.

But hitting the mother lode like this probably isn't going to help Ron's loneliness, something he's only contributing to by trying to put space between himself and Mike. It's worth noting he's by himself in his moment of triumph just as he is when he finds the dubious link between the headphone guy's tattoos and the color schemes on the Delaware City and Red Ball websites. There's already so much he's missing because of work and the investigation, as he's not up to date on where Barb stands with the Everpump investors and he's totally unaware of the project Seth started in the basement with Tara's ponytailed friend Richard. 

It's humming along in the background of this installment, but while Ron is giving his daughter more reasons to worry about him, he's also growing alienated from his son. He can't keep the kid's friends straight anymore, the clandestine drinking is getting worse, and he's too distracted/keyed-up to give into a request to do “the Pee-wee dance” at the party. In his obsession with the chair, Ron is making Seth into a whole other lonely guy. And at the end of this episode, nothing could seem more destructive.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","It's pretty damn ironic that Paramount is behind The Running Man","https://www.avclub.com/the-running-man-was-made-by-its-own-villain-paramount-pictures-skydance","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 16:02:42 GMT","

During the lead up to the release of Edgar Wright's The Running Man, the studio behind this adaptation—Paramount Pictures—kept making fascistic business moves that underlined the irony that it was backing a Running Man movie. Those who knew the story of Stephen King's 2025-set novel were left wondering: Was one of the first films released under the Paramount Skydance banner going to water down the source's anger at an exploitative media monopoly, or did the company simply not care that it was releasing a blockbuster where it was very clearly the villain? The answer, incredibly, seems to be both.

In Wright's take on The Running Man, the villainous, hyper-conservative, cartoonishly patriotic Network fakes its news and reality shows alike as it dominates every facet of dystopian life. Its killer programs air on Free-Vee (not to be confused with Amazon's old streamer) and offer Idiocracy-like content to keep its oppressed viewership complacent, distracted, and fighting amongst themselves. Members of the upper crust are called “execs.” Poor folks live in Slumside. Get it? 

Though the full bleakness of their lives is only alluded to, members of this underclass who step out of line—like Glen Powell's Ben Richards did by speaking to a union rep—are blacklisted from Network subsidiaries…which is pretty much every employer. This desperation in the face of ludicrous income inequality and corporate control is what leads Richards to try out for The Running Man game show.

The broad strokes of the plot see Richards inexplicably become a figure of toothless rebellion for the masses. Perhaps the film's defining tonal moment is Michael Cera's militarized dissident earnestly calling for revolution, then slurping from a can of Monster like a Wayne's World bit. King's rage becomes the butt of a cynical joke, garishly sponsored. And even though Richards does eventually go—to use a modern reference—full Luigi (and Cera's character fries a few masked cops), the film is disappointingly hollow in its artless sentimentality, even if it all wasn't coming from a big-budget reboot starring Tom Cruise's hand-selected heir. More than that, it's who put up the budget in the first place that makes this iteration of The Running Man into a disconcerting metatext.

Paramount, in the last year, has:

So, to summarize: Paramount and its subsidiaries have spent 2025 blacklisting and silencing the opposition from within and without, pissing all over free speech, attempting to shape the news to their favor, and paying off the government—all in service of gaining more control over more of the media landscape. All it needs are some color-coded jumpsuits and the company swaps in for the Network even more fittingly than it cosplays as Nazi Germany in The Rehearsal.

How much of this bootlicking and gag-ordering took place before The Running Man wrapped production on March 28? How about by the time the picture was locked? How much executive influence came down from above before Wright released his least-recognizable film yet? Maybe the outside events of the business side of things had very little impact on this movie. Maybe there'll be a nice big tell-all that'll drop in a few years, documenting how this was the last watered-down drop of anti-establishment sentiment to drip from Paramount before Ellison permanently squeezed that valve shut. But the takeaway, even assuming that there aren't any sinister behind-the-scenes details to know, is a sense of defeated absurdity—if our half-hearted fight-the-power films are coming from the company taking Hollywood's most prominent right turn, how are they supposed to feel like anything other than the kind of placating entertainment pushed out on Free-Vee?

As the AI slop era continues, we're entering a new and deeply troubling phase where some big publishers are beginning to unapologetically use the controversial technology to replace voice actors and artists. The latest case is Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which seems to heavily feature generative AI art in its unlockable calling cards (these are nameplates attached to your profile), posters, and reward icons, among other aspects of the game. Some of the calling cards are in the Studio Ghibli plagiarizing style popularized by OpenAI, and all of them look awful.

Call of Duty isn't even hiding the fact that loads of its calling cards and other unlockables are AI generated this year.

For one of the biggest video game franchises in the world this is pretty disgusting…

While Activision didn't specifically confirm if these cosmetics were AI-generated, they did admit that AI was used to make the game in a statement to XboxEra, which is corpo speak for their developers probably used GenAI to create the images.

Beyond angering many fans of the game, who paid $70 for a title full of ugly art made by robots, Black Ops 7's use of gen-AI has caught the attention of a member of the U.S. government who is not happy about the news.

We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits.

Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed.

They should share in the profits. And there should be a tax on mass displacement. https://t.co/uU2tmt8pDJ

— Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) November 14, 2025



On Twitter, Rep. Ro Khanna (CA) bashed the game's use of AI, citing it as an example of why greater regulations are needed around the technology. He called for artists to get a say in how AI is deployed, and that there should be taxes on “mass displacement” caused by these changes.

He also cited Nobel Laureate Daron Acemoglu's proposition to implement the following: “Tax reforms to discourage excessive automation,” “Guardrails for worker input before deployment. Not a Luddite complete ban,” and “Support unions and workers to bargain for workers benefitting from productivity gains.”

While he frankly doesn't address the ecological concerns of AI and seems to acquiesce that it will become a central part of game development and society writ large, Khanna's rebuke of Black Ops 7's AI art ties into ongoing questions about how to regulate the rapidly growing technology. The Republican-led House of Representatives previously tried to slip a 10-year ban on state and local AI regulation from Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” before it was thankfully axed after heavy blowback from voters.

As for Black Ops 7, its use of generative AI isn't the only reason why it's getting bashed. The game's single-player mode is online-only, will boot you if you're idle for too long, and doesn't feature checkpoints or pausing. It's designed around co-op, but doesn't provide you with AI allies, meaning playing solo is a slow and painful process. It is also apparently set in a big reused map from its Warzone mode. The game is currently sitting at Mixed on Steam with only 42% positive reviews, and its Metacritic user score is the lowest ever for a Call of Duty game, at a brutal 1.8/10— yes, user reviews tend to be plagued by brigading, but at least Steam requires users to actually own the game to leave feedback.

While the spread of AI nonsense is deeply depressing, at least it seems that many players aren't happy about it, with Steam reviewers describing the game as an “AI generated slop shooter” and that “If there was a an award for ‘Worst Game of The Year', there's no doubt in my mind that it would go to Black ops 7.” Hopefully, the blowback will convince at least some of these out-of-touch suits that, regardless of what Elon Musk-fanboys on Twitter say, most people do want their art crafted by humans instead of machines.

Beloved actress Jane Seymour opened up about falling in love again in her 70s, revealing the shocking way she met her partner, John Zambetti.

Seymour, 74, celebrated her “25th anniversary” with Zambetti on the day of her interview with HELLO!, which was published on October 28.

“25 months today,” the “Dear Prudence” actress told the outlet. “We decided that [because] we met in our 70s, it's probably safer to go every month. So every month, on the fourth, he sends me roses, wherever I am, whatever's going on. We're just so grateful for every minute we have together.”

The pair met at a Shwayze concert two years ago after John expressed interest in the Hallmark actress. 

“Our kids pretty much put us together. They're the ones that heard that he'd seen me and asked whether I was single or not,” Seymour told HELLO!, explaining that the “Buzzin'” singer is a “mutual best friend.”

“Shwayze knew I would go and watch him because I've always supported him – I'm like his surrogate mother. And it turns out John's always been his surrogate father.”

The jewelry designer was married and divorced four times before meeting the emergency room doctor.  

“I honestly never thought I would find a really committed, healthy, lovely, loving relationship at this time of my life,” she told HELLO! “But I'm incredibly blessed that I have. 70 is the new 50.”

She continued, “You've had a life. Many lives. And children, and grandchildren, and careers, and ups and downs. You know what you want. I consider both of us so fortunate to have found each other at the time we have, because it wouldn't have ever worked earlier. He had a different life – his world was medicine and touring, and mine was running around the world making movies. I think we met each other at exactly the right time.”

While she's enjoying her time and celebrating all the small milestones with Zambetti, Seymour previously revealed that marriage is not on her mind. 

“All I know is that right now, I am very happy,” she told People in May 2024. “I'm happier than I remember being for as long as I can remember. My family's happy, everyone's happy, and I don't want to mess with happy. So, for right now, where I'm at is really good.”









So glad that Miss Seymour is so happy. I just watched the show she did where she surprised her friend with a home renovation with The Property Brothers and Jane Seymour is funny, loyal, and gutsy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kim Zolciak-Biermann & Ariana Biermann Pose Together in Sheer Outfits: PHOTO","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/kim-zolciak-biermann-ariana-biermann-sheer/","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 02:35:46 GMT","

Teddi Mellencamp wasn't the only one to wear a sheer piece to BravoCon 2025. “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” alum Kim Zolciak-Biermann and her daughter, Ariana Biermann, posed together while both wearing very different see-through items.

In a photo of the pair together that was posted by BravoTV to Instagram on Friday, November 14, Kim could be seen in a form-fitting black gown that boasted long sleeves and a split on the side. In the space where the black fabric fell away, a sheer lacy section could be seen.

As for Ariana, she opted for a sheer piece of what appeared to be lingerie. Also black, it featured lacy panels and basic sheer sections. Overtop, she wore a loose pair of leather pants.

A few social media users took a moment to comment on what they were seeing.

One person wrote, “You guys look great❤️ @arianabiermann such a a beauty !!!”

“Love seeing Kim & Ariana! 🥹✨😍,” someone else added.

Another person wrote, “Ari is everything 🔥🔥🔥🔥”

Even Kim left a comment, writing, “Having the best time at BracoCon!!!”

If it isn't obvious from the picture of her BravoCon appearance, Ariana is no longer the child that fans first saw on her mom's show all those years ago. Nowadays, she's an adult, even though some people may forget that at times.

“When our moms were on Housewives, we were kids. A lot of the time, people still think I'm 12 years old,” Ariana told Us Weekly in April 2025. “They're like, ‘Why are you wearing a bikini?' I'm like, ‘Girl, I'm 23. I'm actually grown up now.'”

In fact, she's now 24.

Part of growing up is figuring out what you want to do for a career. For Ariana, that meant pursuing a path in fashion. However, things haven't gone as smoothly as she surely hoped.

According to The Daily Dish, Ariana revealed in an August interview that she had some “unfortunate” news about her fashion line, which she had deemed Adored Angels.

“You know, unfortunately, I just don't think I'm as talented as I thought,” she said. “Like, in all actuality, I think I had this different idea of what I wanted to do, and I just don't think that I can produce the best thing.”

“And so I just want to be like, honest, and if I'm going to put something out there, I want it to be the best ever,” she added. “And right now, it's just not looking too hot.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","‘Southern Charm' Star Madison LeCroy In ‘Frightening' Car Accident at BravoCon","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/madison-lecroy-car-accident-crash/","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 14:15:32 GMT","

“Southern Charm” star Madison LeCroy was involved in a car accident at BravoCon 2025 in Las Vegas.

The reality television star revealed the news to fans with a note on her Instagram Story on Nov. 15.

“Hey y'all… I want to let you know I won't be making it to WWHL tonight,” she wrote. “My team and I were in a car accident on the way back to the hotel. Thankfully we're all okay, but it was frightening and we're still trying to catch our breath from it. I'm just grateful everyone walked away.”

“I felt so much love today and sad I won't make it tonight,” she concluded. 

LeCroy is scheduled to be on the panel, It's All About To Go South, on Nov. 16 alongside fellow “Southern Charm” castmates Patricia Altschul, Venita Aspen, Salley Carson, Craig Conover, Austen Kroll, Molly O'Connell, Rodrigo Reyes, Shep Rose and Whitney Sudler-Smith.

In June, LeCroy and her husband, Brett Randle welcomed their daughter, Teddi, who is the couple's first child together. The reality star also shares a 12-year-old son, Hudson, with her ex-husband Josh Hughes. 

At the time of her birth, Teddi weighed “only five pounds,” which led to her spending some time in the NICU, LeCroy told Us Weekly. Teddi ultimately came home after a two-week stay at the hospital.

“She's breathing on her own and hasn't needed any oxygen or anything like that. She's kind of a little trooper,” LeCroy told the outlet. “[Doctors] were shocked with how early she was that she was gonna be this independent. So, I was like, ‘Oh, I wasn't shocked at all.'”

The highly anticipated 11th season of “Southern Charm” will be here in no time. The show is set to premiere on Wednesday, Nov. 19, and the trailer teased tons of drama along with some new romances. Things will begin with LeCroy's baby shower, which was highlighted in an exclusive clip shared by Bravo.

The end of Season 10 showed Craig Conover and former “Summer House” star Paige DeSorbo having broken up. And it seems this new season has him embracing the single life, with possible sparks flying between Salley Carson and newcomer Charley Manely. Plus, it seems Conover and Austen Kroll's friendship troubles continue into this new season. 

Along with Conover, LeCroy, Kroll, Carson, Manely, the cast will include Shep Rose, Venita Aspen, Rodrigo Reyes, Molly O'Connell and newcomer Whitner Slagsvol.

When “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum Teddi Mellencamp stepped out for BravoCon 2025, there's no doubt that she looked lovely. However, one outfit may have outshone any others. That happens to be the sheer dress that she wore to The Bravos award show.

Seen posing in a pic with “The Real Housewives of Orange County” star Tamra Judge that was shared on Instagram on Friday, November 14, Teddi opted to wear a full-length piece that was high on the neck and featured long sleeves. The sheer fabric boasted a gorgeous floral design and underneath Teddi wore a black bra and panties. While you couldn't see her shoes (which were surely fabulous), she did opt to wear striking silver earrings.

On top of that, Teddi wore her hair in a blonde pixie cut with the front brushed up and the sides brushed back. While it wasn't clear if it was a wig or not —  she's experienced some hair loss due to cancer treatments — either way it looked amazing.

In the caption, Tamra wrote, “Two BravHos on their way to The Bravos 🖤”

When Tamra posted the photo of herself and Teddi to Instagram, plenty of people left comments admiring Teddi's look.

One person wrote, “Tedd[i] looks stunning w that hair style! She looks like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct! 👏❤️”

“You look unreal @teddimellencamp so so beautiful ✨️✨️✨️,” another added.

A third person wrote, “Teddi looks stunning I love her with short hair ❤️”

“The short cut on Teddi looks amazing. She's rocking it,” came from another follower.

Someone else wrote, “Teddi is stunning. Her style is amazing!”

Although Teddi is dealing with cancer, she was still able to make it to BravoCon and is thankful for that fact.

“I just feel grateful that I'm able to be here and that I feel good enough to be here,” she told People. “So, I'm feeling excited. This is something I needed to do, and I'm glad that I came.”

Kyle Richards, who spent the day with Teddi, added, “You were a little nervous too.”

“I was nervous,” Teddi agreed. “I was like, ‘Oh no. What if I can't do it? What if I…' But it's one of those things that once you get your feet wet, you feel alright.”

“With the Vegas energy, you can't help but feel energized,” Kyle also noted. 

Teddi felt the same way, saying, “I definitely feel more energized.”

“Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” star Jen Affleck is standing by her husband Zac Affleck after their relationship was subject to scrutiny during her run on “Dancing With The Stars.”

Jen was eliminated from the competition during the October 28 episode following her Halloween-themed contemporary routine to Taylor Swift's “Look What You Made Me Do.”

After her elimination, Zac had to shut down the suggestion that he was happy to see her time on the show come to an end.

Someone on TikTok reenacted Zac's reaction to Jen and partner Jan Ravnik's elimination, utilizing a popular trend on the app where a person pretends to look sad before smiling for a split second at the camera before looking sad again.

“Youre honestly disgusting,” Zac wrote in the comments, “Grow up.”

FREE HER!!!! SHE HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL #dwts #dancingwiththestars #momtok #halloween @Dancing with the Stars #DWTS 

In an exclusive interview with E! News that she did with her “Mormon Wives” castmate Jessi Ngatikaura, Jen expressed her frustration with all the speculation. “It can be tiring and draining, just because it gets old having to hear the same things,” Jen said. “For me, I'm like, ‘People will always talk and people will always have their opinions,' and I think it is frustrating for him when people don't see what's happening behind closed doors and how much work and effort he's putting in.”

Jen noted how her and Zac were both still learning to deal with all the attention.

“We're working on just tuning out the noise of the world—I think it still is hard for him.” She added, “It's hard to have to constantly open your phone and see negative comments and it's hard not to take that in,” she explained. “Even if you say you don't take it in, subconsciously we all care to a certain point. For me, I always have to remind myself, I post, I share my story, and then I take a step back. As long as I'm focusing on being the best version of myself, that's all that matters.”

“I feel like we've grown so much,” she reasoned. “Clearly, if we hadn't been part of Momtok or been part of this show, we wouldn't have gone through everything that we went through this last year. Even though that was so hard and almost broke us, it actually strengthened us in the long run.”

Despite the challenges they've faced in their marriage, in private or in the public eye, Jen admitted, “I feel like we've grown so much. Clearly, if we hadn't been part of MomTok or been part of this show, we wouldn't have gone through everything that we went through this last year. Even though that was so hard and almost broke us, it actually strengthened us in the long run.”

This isn't the first time that Jen has stood firmly by her marriage to Zac. 

In an Instagram post from October 7, Jen wrote her appreciation for her husband in the caption.

“Appreciation post for this guy,” she began. “He's the one who checks that l've actually eaten breakfast, who reminds me to sleep and makes sure I get real rest. What you don't see are all the quiet ways he keeps us going-cooking, cleaning, kid duty, and those late-night shifts with Penny. This journey truly wouldn't be possible without him, and for that, I am forever grateful.”

“The Running Man” hit a wall this weekend at the box office, with Edgar Wright's dystopian Stephen King adaptation, meant as another star-status-securing vehicle for Glen Powell, disappointing with just $28 million globally, $17 million in the United States.

On the most recent episode of IndieWire's “Screen Talk” podcast (posted over the weekend), co-hosts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio debated the merits and shortcomings of what is demonstrably a better film than Wright's last narrative outing, the pandemic underachiever “Last Night in Soho.” The “Baby Driver” and “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” director's latest lacks the “musicality” (IndieWire chief critic David Ehrlich's word) of his prior efforts.

Per Ryan, while “The Running Man” isn't short on intriguing visuals situated in an '80s-inspired future, as a sci-fi action film about living in a totalitarian police state, the film doesn't tell us or ask us anything new about our own world. Anne praises the movie's kinetic energy and dystopian exaggeration of our current world of haves and have-nots.

Elsewhere on this week's episode, we also catch up on the latest Film Twitter craze around studio movie pull quotes gone overboard, starting with Focus Features quoting burgeoning film site The Rolling Tape calling “Hamnet,” out of context, “the best film ever made.” The week before, Neon quoted Eli Roth in its marketing materials as likening Oz Perkins' “Keeper” to “a surreal David Lynch movie.” OK then. The onus is less on the attributed speakers and more on studios that are setting themselves up for too-high expectations, doing nobody favors with such grand proclamations. But then again, this is a tradition that harks back to the early days of moviemaking.

Also this week, we look at the Oscar-bound independent films that have underperformed at the box office, from Black Bear's “Christy,” starring Sydney Sweeney, to Benny Safdie's “The Smashing Machine,” which last week received a Variety cover story that attempts to position the Dwayne Johnson-starrer for an Oscar season comeback.

One of Rian Johnson‘s ongoing murder mystery franchises has had a tumultuous week, but the other appears to be stronger than ever. Benoit Blanc will be back on the case (and our Netflix screens) this holiday season in “Wake Up Dead Man,” the third entry in the mystery series that began with 2019's “Knives Out” and continued with 2022's “Glass Onion.”

The new whodunnit sees Daniel Craig‘s brilliant detective visiting a church to look into the seemingly impossible murder of a monsignor (Josh Brolin) and investigating an ensemble of suspects played by the likes of Josh O'Connor, Glenn Close, Thomas Haden Church, Kerry Washington, Daryl McCormack, Jeremy Renner, Andrew Scott, and Cailee Spaeny, all while working alongside a police chief played by Mila Kunis.

In addition to the ongoing influence of Agatha Christie on the franchise, “Wake Up Dead Man” looks like it could reflect a variety of other influences from Johnson's extensive knowledge of whodunnits and crime fiction. The Gothic undertones drew instant comparisons to the mysteries of Edgar Allan Poe, while the impossible crime and religious setting appear to invoke the work of other Golden Age mystery authors such as John Dickson Carr and G.K. Chesterton.

Like its two predecessors in the Benoit Blanc series, “Wake Up Dead Man” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, where critics praised Johnson for taking the franchise in a darker direction.

“How do you battle faith and belief? For someone like Benoit, so steeped in rationality, so happy to announce he's a heretic while literally standing in a church, the question could not be harder to answer,” IndieWire's Kate Erbland wrote in her review. “Thankfully, Johnson and his cast are more than up for the task, guiding ‘Wake Up Dead Man' through all the requisite twists and turns, ups and downs, revelations and Revelations. Tales are spun and then immediately tied back up into knots, and its Gothic drama provides a fresh new place for Johnson to play in his preferred genre.”

“Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” opens in select theaters on Wednesday, November 26 before streaming on Netflix on Friday, December 12. Watch the trailer below.

See how far audiences will go to race to the theater to see this one. Disney unveiled the first look at the teaser for the live-action “Moana,” with Dwayne Johnson reprising his role as Maui and starring Catherine Lagaʻaia as the title Disney princess Moana. 

Considering that “Moana” has been one of the biggest hits over the last decade of the streaming era, we predict that this one will absolutely soar at the box office. 

In addition to Lagaʻaia and Johnson, the “Moana” cast includes Auckland, New Zealand, native John Tui as Moana's father, Samoan-New Zealander Frankie Adams as Moana's mother, and Rena Owen, from Bay of Islands, New Zealand, as Moana's revered Gramma Tala.

“Moana” is directed by “Hamilton” director Thomas Kail and produced by Dwayne Johnson, along with Beau Flynn, Dany Garcia, Hiram Garcia and Lin-Manuel Miranda; and executive produced by Kail, Scott Sheldon, Charles Newirth and Auliʻi Cravalho, who voiced Moana in the animated features “Moana” and “Moana 2.”

 










“Moana” follows a girl from her island home of Motunui who answers the ocean's call and sets off on a voyage beyond the reef of her island, where no one has ventured in generations, in order to track down the infamous demigod Maui and restore her island and people to health and its former glory. Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote the music for the film, and he scored an Oscar nomination for the original track “How Far I'll Go,” which is featured in the teaser for this film, but it also includes a number of other bops such as Maui's diddy “You're Welcome.” 

The original “Moana” released in 2016 and made $643 million worldwide at the box office, becoming one of Disney's biggest original animated hits of this century this side of “Frozen” and “Encanto.” Though an animated series was originally intended for Disney+ as a streaming exclusive, the series was eventually converted into a new theatrical film, which opened last year and made over $1 billion globally at the box office. 

“Moana” opens in U.S. theaters on July 10, 2026. Watch the first teaser trailer above.

Sonic the Hedgehog is no stranger to reinvention. Sega's blue-quilled mascot has evolved a ton over time, making the leap from 2D to 3D, bouncing between genres, and getting a total aesthetic redesign in the process. But 2008's Sonic Unleashed was a game very literally about change, predicated on the concept of Sonic giving into his feral side by morphing into a monstrous “werehog.”


	The theme song from Sonic Unleashed is still a favorite among fans, who fervently rally its GOAT status online. Titled “Endless Possibility,” the track was originally composed by Sega's Tomoya Ohtani and performed by pop-punk band Bowling for Soup. Now, 17 years later, “Endless Possibility” itself is being reimagined with a newly re-recorded version produced in collaboration between Bowling for Soup, Wheatus (known for 2000's “Teenage Dirtbag“), and the viral cover band Punk Rock Factory.


Rolling Stone has an exclusive premiere of the new rendition of “Endless Possibility,” which features vocals from Bowling for Soup's Jaret Reddick and Rob Felicetti, and Wheatus' Brendan Brown on lead guitar. Listen to the track below.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The cover retains much of the 2000s-era pop-punk energy of the original but is noticeably crunchier and heavier. Rolling Stone spoke with Bowling for Soup frontman, Jaret Reddick, about the making of the song  —  as well as the legacy shared legacy of Sonic the Hedgehog and the band.

	











Did you play a lot of Sonic the Hedgehog games when you were younger?I love the movies because I have a 13-year-old and he's been growing up with these new Jim Carrey movies, and I think they're so great. [I] wasn't a video game kid. I was born in [1972] so, really, I'm an Atari 2600 guy. [But] obviously, I knew who Sonic was. I knew that he was this fast little guy, and I always thought that he was this really interesting character. It's been cool for me to see the resurgence of all of that.

What about the character appeals to you? He's got a bit of a punk attitude.He's a little bit snarky and a little bit funny, and a little bit self-deprecating — but still smart and loving, which I think is very Bowling for Soup. It's like, sure, okay, we're the funny band, but there's some substance there. Sonic has a little substance in his heart as well.


How did you end up working with Punk Rock Factory and Wheatus for the new cover?When I went to Punk Rock Factory, who I thought were the perfect band to do this with, because they've covered so many things in movies and television, but also video games and cartoons — I was like, “Dude, I've got the perfect song for us to do.”


	[This] song has a really serious cult following. There are a lot of people who know Bowling for Soup because of this song, because of this video game. It hasn't been available to them on a widespread scale other than just the random YouTube videos and stuff. The guys just nailed it.


	It sounds like a pop punk song. It's fast, like Sonic. The music really does lend itself to his pace. When I heard the track, I was like, “We're definitely onto something.” Then, well, we've got this show coming up at Wembley and Brendan [Brown] from Wheatus can actually shred on the guitar. So, I'm like, “Let's all three of us be on this song together, and it'll be thing that we can get out before the play the biggest show of Bowling for Soup's career.”


Why is now the right time to bring this song back, 17 years later?First of all, Sonic being around and the movies doing so well is one thing, but also just the nostalgia of our music [and] our genre — what's going on with so many of us having celebrated 20 years of really big records and everybody's back out there on the road. It's just a really good time, both in the nostalgia of both the character [and] our band. It's one of those things where everybody's sort of looking back on that part of their childhood right now, and Sonic is certainly a big part of that.

How does it feel to have a place in the legacy of Sonic through music, and for Sonic to be a part of yours?These are the kind of things [that] don't surprise me. If I get on a TikTok Live or something, you expect people to go, “Oh, ‘Girl All the Bad Guys Want' is the first pop punk song I heard,” or, “'1985' is the first single I ever bought.” Those are all things [where] I'm very lucky, but I can sort of expect to hear. The Sonic thing, it still kind of catches me off guard because it's still so much of, “Please put ‘Endless Possibilities' in your set.”

	It's one of those things where sometimes a song ties to something, and it's just this perfect blend. [For] so many people, this was their intro into the Sonic universe, and this song is a part of that exploration. It's part of his journey in that video game. It's like pop punk kids sitting at Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and listening to Pennywise and Goldfinger. It's the same thing.


Tony Hawk is a good comparison, but it's almost even further here because “Endless Possibilities” wasn't just one of your singles used for a game's soundtrack.A hundred percent. This song was specifically written for that character. I was in his head when I was writing. He is who I represent in the lyrics; we've all got to start from somewhere. For me, possibilities are never ending, and I feel like that's how Sonic is, man. He believes he can do anything. When he gets down on himself, he figures it out. And that's what the song says.

Tom Cruise is now the proud winner of an Academy Award. The Mission Impossible actor accepted an honorary Oscar on Sunday night at the Governors Awards, giving an emotional speech that paid tribute to his history with movies.


	The award was presented by Mexican filmmaker Alejandro G. Iñárritu, who is directing Cruise in an upcoming film set for release next October. It marks Cruise's first Oscar, although he has previously been nominated four times, including for Best Actor for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire.


	“The cinema, it takes me around the world,” Cruise told the audience (via Variety). “It helps me to appreciate and respect differences. It shows me also our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. And no matter where we come from, in that theater, we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together, and that is the power of this art form. And that is why it matters, that is why it matters to me. So making films is not what I do, it is who I am.”

	











	The actor also reflected on his love for cinema, which “began at a very early age.” He remembered doing whatever he could to get into the theater to see films. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I was just a little kid in a darkened theater, and I remember that beam of light just cut across the room, and I remember looking up, and it seemed to be just exploded on the screen,” he recalled. “Suddenly, the world was so much larger than the one that I knew. And entire cultures and lives and landscapes all unfolded in front of me, and it sparked something. It sparked a hunger for adventure, a hunger for knowledge, a hunger to understand humanity, to create characters, to tell a story, to see the world. It opened my eyes. It opened my imagination to the possibility that life could expand far beyond the boundaries that I then perceived in my own life. And that beam of light opened a desire to open the world, and I have been following it ever since.”

	











	He added in conclusion, “I want you to know that I will do everything I can for this art form, to support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful. Hopefully without too many more broken bones.”


	Earlier this year, Cruise released the supposedly final film in the Mission Impossible franchise, Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning. In May, the actor received the BFI Fellowship from the British Film Institute, the organization's highest honor. During an event title “Tom Cruise in Conversation,” Cruise admitted there are still things on his cinematic bucket list.

	“Definitely musicals,” Cruise said when asked he wants to do next as a performer. “Drama, action, adventures. It's endless. My goals are endless.”


	Along with Cruise, the Academy also presented honorary Oscars to Dolly Parton, Debbie Allen, and Wynn Thomas.

Rosalía appeared on The Tonight Show last night to perform her song “La Perla” and to discuss her new album, Lux, with host Jimmy Fallon. 


	The Spanish singer showcased the evocative track in a sumptuous white gown while lying on a pile of mattresses on the late-night show stage. As the camera pulled back, it was revealed that she was surrounded by musicians, including a strings section. In a reference to fairy tale The Princess and the Pea, Rosalía climbed down from the bed and revealed a pearly ball (hence the song's title) from under the mattresses. Notably, the performance was subtitled in English for viewers. 


	The singer sat down with Fallon to chat about Lux, which features her singing in 13 different languages. It also includes classical influences, which she said is a new direction for her. “I always get nervous when I'm sharing it,” she said of her approach. “More than when I'm doing it. When I'm about to go to the studio I know how I want it to sound. I know how it's going to be.”

	











	Rosalía also showed Fallon how she created different rhythms on the album by clapping and taught him various vocal warm-ups she uses for her performances.

	The singer later joined Fallon for a game of “Seductive, Insulting, or Nonsense.” The game involved Rosalía speaking to Fallon in Spanish while he attempted to guess the tone of her speech, including her seductively intoning “I think you have your toupée on backwards.” 

	











Lux is out now, showcasing operatic inspirations, collaborations with the London Symphony Orchestra, and careful training Rosalia perfected through years of work. Rolling Stone lauded Lux as an instant classic, calling it “a truly timeless work of art” that “no other pop star could have made.”

Paul McCartney is finally opening up one of the most fascinating chapters of his life. Wings: The Story of a Band on the Run is the new book on McCartney in the 1970s — how he started over and found his own voice after the demise of the Beatles. Rolling Stone has an exclusive excerpt of Paul reading from the audiobook, including his witty imitation of Mick Jagger.


	“For so many decades,” McCartney recalls in the excerpt, “I tried to pack away these stories about how I felt when the Beatles collapsed and what happened in that period just as we were launching Wings.” 


	When the Beatles fell apart in early 1970, McCartney was lost and confused, with no idea how to move forward. So he started up a whole new band, with his wife Linda. It sounded like a crazy idea. As he says, “When Linda joined Wings, eyebrows were raised, and not only in the press, Mick Jagger adding, ‘Wot's he got his old lady in the band for?'”


	The Wings book is a massive oral history edited by Ted Widmer, from new interviews by filmmaker Morgan Neville (20 Feet From Stardom). It accompanies Neville's upcoming documentary Man on the Run, which recently debuted at the Telluride Film Festival. The book has 150 photographs, with Paul's handwritten lyrics and diary entries, along with commentary from Linda McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, George Martin, Sean Ono Lennon, Jann Wenner, Yoko Ono, Mick Jagger, and all the members of Wings. 

	











	The book follows the story from McCartney's 1969 solo debut and the 1971 classic Ram. But instead of going for superstar sessions, or high-profile solo shows, he recruits a new band and starts over from scratch, based from his Scottish farm, hustling the way his old band used to in the early days. They drive around to universities and play tiny shows for surprised students, with that experimental spirit. “The fact was that we could just try things and just do them,” McCartney recalls. “If it worked, great. If it didn't, just go to another idea.”

	But Wings blew up into one of the Seventies' biggest arena-rock groups, making classics like Band on the Run and Venus and Mars. The band is also dropping a definitive triple-vinyl anthology set, personally selected by McCartney. It has the hits you'd expect, like “Jet,” “Hi, Hi, Hi,” “Band on the Run,” “Live and Let Die,” and “Let Me Roll It.” But it's also full of deep cuts (“Deliver Your Children,” “I've Had Enough,” “Some People Never Know”) and fan-fave oddities like “She's My Baby” and “Call Me Back Again.”

	The band ended in 1980, after an episode McCartney has rarely discussed in depth before—his nine-day stay in a Japanese prison, after a drug bust at the Tokyo airport. For years, he was reluctant to reclaim this period. “But suddenly, Wings has found its moment again,” he recalls. “I remember doing an interview with a young guy, I think it was with Rolling Stone, and I was talking about Sgt. Pepper and the Beatles. And he said, ‘Well, yeah, I get that, but that's not really my period.' He said, ‘I'm more interested in Wings and Band on the Run.' I thought, here we go. We have a generational shift at work.”


Wings comes at a typically busy time for McCartney. He's currently on his long-running Got Back tour, playing his marathon shows in the U.S. and Canada, wrapping up on November 25 in Chicago.  Later this month, The Beatles' beloved Anthology doc is returning in a long-awaited new version — restored, expanded, and remastered, with a new episode streaming on Disney + beginning November 26.

	Korean beauty brand TIRTIR announced BTS star V as their first-ever global brand ambassador earlier this month, and the singer was on hand to celebrate Friday night at TIRTIR's new “Radiant Pop-Up” in Los Angeles. 


	V was joined by Madelaine Petsch, Charles Melton, Isabela Merced, and Emily Alyn Lind, among the many stars celebrating TIRTIR at a special preview event the night before the pop-up opened to the public. Though it was a private event, that didn't stop fans from lining up in the rain outside for a chance to catch a glimpse of V, who was dressed in a relaxed, double-breasted camel suit for the occasion. 


	Guests at the event were welcomed into a fully immersive experience, complete with a specialty cocktail bar serving “TIRTIR Kiss” and “Stella Rosa Rosso” drinks, a one-on-one foundation color-matching experience, a bespoke lip and skincare zone, and a matcha café, for a true Los Angeles touch. Per a release, the space marks a “meaningful milestone for the brand,” serving to not only unveil V as global ambassador, but also helping to launch TIRTIR's new logo and bring its beloved line of beauty and skincare products to the U.S. market.




	TIRTIR put the spotlight on its star product, the Mask Fit Red Cushion Foundation, by giving the pop-up space a dramatic transformation, with red carpet accents and rich, red velvet drapes. The Mask Fit Red Cushion is known to be the first Korean cushion foundation with an impressive 40-shade range that is long-lasting yet weightless. In fact, the brand says the foundation can provide full coverage for up to 72 hours. Not sure what shade to get? Fans at the TIRTIR pop-up have access to a color matching experience that can help them find their perfect shade; you can also consult TIRTIR's helpful guides online.




	Cushion foundations are widely popular in Asia for their quick and easy application, as well as portability for light touch ups when needed, and have been staples in stars' stage prep routines for years.

		The TIRTIR Cushion Foundation is available now on Amazon in more than two dozen shades. It's not just for covering up blemishes and imperfections either: the brand says its foundation formula has skin nourishing ingredients to help enhance texture, elasticity and provide a healthy glow (many people also purchase this product as a tattoo cover-up).	


	V briefly chatted with Rolling Stone as he arrived to the L.A. pop-up, saying he was “excited to look around. I've been frequently visiting LA recently, so it feels like home to me now,” he added, with a smile.  


	TIRTIR says V will help bring to life its new campaign, dubbed “Your Shade, Our Standard,” through the experiential concept “V&You, Let's Radiate.” Adds a company spokesperson, “Launching our pop-up on Melrose represents an important milestone in expanding TIRTIR's presence within the global beauty landscape. We are thrilled to introduce our signature cushion lineup and the unique sensibility of K-beauty directly to local consumers.”




	The TIRTIR in LA pop-up experience will run through November 23rd at 8175 Melrose Avenue, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekends.

It's the latest in a disturbing string of sightings

A PAIR of factory workers claim they've accidentally caught footage of a dish-shaped UFO gliding across the sky. 

Alex Ramage and Andrei Volk were filming a plane to test the zoom on a phone's camera when they saw something that left them in awe.

The clip, shot on their work break in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, on November 4, shows a mysterious oval object appearing to glide across the sky.

The pair were speechless when they watched the bizarre footage and the UFO left Alex, 33, believing they'd captured evidence that aliens exist.

He and Andrei, 38, insist they haven't faked the video and can't think of any other explanation for what the unknown mass could be.

Alex, from Oshkosh, said, “We thought it was pretty wild and we were freaking out about it.

“We were filming the plane to check out the zoom on a Samsung's phone camera then we happened to replay the video and see the little dish-shaped thing.

“To me it looks like you can make out a dome shape in the middle of the disk, like a traditional UFO people imagine.

“It looked way different than the movement of a plane. It was gliding so I don't think it was anything like that.

“We were in shock and awe because I've always believed in UFOs but to experience it for myself is amazing.

“It was a speechless moment because we were just randomly filming something. What are the odds?”

This is just the latest in a string of terrifying apparent UFO sightings.

Parkgoers were left in shock after spotting a black ring hovering above Disneyland in California, sparking fears that alien life was nearby.

Lori Nayahalski, who captured a viral video of the sight, started an online firestorm when she shared the footage.

She said she was most struck by the ring somehow staying intact as it moved across the sky.

“Real-life Matrix or just an orchestrated spoof,” she told CW-affiliate KTLA as she discussed the terrifying sight.

However, a spokesperson with Disney said the smoke was merely caused by a pyrotechnics test.

Meanwhile, an investigative YouTuber recently revealed footage of a UFO-like object hovering over a US military-linked base.

He said the object was spotted near a building where secret weapons experiments take place.


						FOR decades, UFOs and aliens were considered to be make belief things created by people in tinfoil hats but they are now considered a threat to national security.					

Long gone are those who claim conspiracy theories are all false as many are now discussed at the highest levels of government with US officials even admitting their existence.

As more and more credible witnesses continue to come forward to tell their extraordinary stories publicly.

The 2010s saw decades of stigmas around extraterrestrial life start to break down as politicians made UFO sightings a matter of national security.

Across the world, governments have also unveiled some spooky truths with some even showcasing “dead alien corpses” on display for Congress.

Researchers verified the legitimacy of a set of three-fingered mummies as potential evidence of “non-human” life forms.

The Pentagon also released a blockbuster 1,574 pages of real-life X-Files in 2022, related to its secretive UFO programme.

The haul includes reports into research on the biological effects of UFO sightings on humans, sets out categorisations for paranormal experiences, and studies into sci-fi-style tech.

Top UFO chief Sean Kirkpatrick told the world last year that he is set to step down from his job following his stern warning of concerning activity “in our backyard.”

The Pentagon‘s UFO analysis office launched a UFO reporting service to the public after admitting to uncovering “some things” and calling the high number of suspicious activity either a foreign power or aliens.

Navy jet footage has revealed the intriguing images of a government-confirmed UFO baffling the internet.

The United States Government launched the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","Elon Musk says 3I/ATLAS space object 'could be alien' and 'kill most of human life'","https://www.themirror.com/news/science/comet-atlas-alien-elon-musk-1509355","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 10:22:00 GMT","

Elon Musk says a mystery object hurtling through space 'could be alien ' and may 'obliterate a continent' or 'kill most of human life'.

The composition of interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS has been puzzling scientists for four months. While some believe it is a comet racing through the Solar System at 130,000mph, leading theoretical physicist Avi Loeb has suggested it could be an alien 'mothership'.

UFO enthusiasts think it could be extraterrestrials attempting to make first contact. SpaceX boss Musk told the Joe Rogan Experience podcast that while it may be an unusual comet or asteroid it 'could be alien - I don't know'.

He cautioned whatever it is it will pose a massive collision risk if it strays from its plotted Earth fly-past on December 19. That is the date scientists believe it will come closest to Earth.

They believe it will get no nearer than 170 million miles away. But Musk cautioned space chiefs must continue to monitor its approach in case it strays from its predicted flight path, reports the Daily Star.

He said if it struck Earth it 'would like obliterate a continent type of thing,' adding, ""Maybe worse. Probably kill most of human life. If not all of us.""

Astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System spotted the Manhattan-sized object racing through the Solar System on an escape trajectory on July 1 triggering widespread speculation about its origin. It marks only the third confirmed visitor from beyond our solar system, following 2017's 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov two years later.

Scientists have suggested 3I/ATLAS may have been drifting through space for 10 billion years.

When it reached its closest point to the Sun on October 30, researchers observed it making non-gravitational accelerations, while a radio signal detected from the object left observers stunned.

Professor Loeb stated its 'anomalies' suggest it 'might' be an extraterrestrial spaceship.

Its conduct has been so unusual that he indicated he will never be able to dismiss the possibility it is an alien craft.

On his UFO scale where zero represents something 'consistent with known natural phenomena' and 10 is of 'confirmed extraterrestrial origin' he stated 3I/Atlas would always at least be a two - an object 'meriting attention'. Telescopes around the globe are monitoring its every movement.

British documentary film-maker Mark Christopher Lee has suggested humanity could be on the verge of making first contact with ET in time for Christmas.

He has stated: ""These are weird times and we've always looked to the stars for guidance – and we need guidance now in 2025.

""The UFOlogist in me sees 3I/ATLAS's Earth flyby just before Christmas as no coincidence.""

""We could detect signals or course changes by December 19 to 25. They're centralising contact authority just as the world watches.""

The shocking revelation in the trove of 20,000 emails from the sordid world of Jeffrey Epstein is not that crimes were being committed.

It's more sinister. The emails are disturbing because what they reveal — and in fact prove — is that conspiracy theorists are right. That their theories of full-on corruption in the upper spheres where power lives are valid. That the “Eyes Wide Shut“ cabal of political and financial interests married to sinister sexual deviance depicted in Stanley Kubrick's 1999 film is not, in fact, fiction. It is reality.

So often journalists like myself attempt to demonstrate to family members and voters in the far reaches of the country, away from centers of power and money, that their conspiracies are false. That politicians are flawed, but that corruption is not the norm. It isn't how we all operate.

But the Epstein emails suggest otherwise. They suggest that in fact there is a widespread code among people with power and money who support one another. They are pals no matter what side of the aisle. They are in the club no matter the sins of their members — transgressions that get contextualized, explained away, “understood.”

Leave aside, for a moment, Donald Trump's involvement in any of this. His name appears more than 1,600 times in the email release, according to a Wall Street Journal review, and we all know how hard he's fighting to keep the files from the Department of Justice investigation from being released.

But the web extends beyond the President of the United States. Epstein's email pals range across the landscape of the politics and trip across business, media, tech, academia and society, from former Harvard president and U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to former White House Democratic counsel Kathy Ruemmler. From MAGA dark knight Steve Bannon to prime ministers across northern Europe and Gulf oil dignitaries.

They include chummy conversations with a New Age health guru Deepak Chopra and a New York PR fixer Peggy Siegel, with a New York Times journalist Landon Thomas Jr, a Bonfire of the Vanities simulacrum Michael Wolff – and Harvard literature professor and poet Elisa Lew, whom Epstein gave a $500,000 donation for her TV project, “Poetry in America.”

In an email, she recommended he read “Lolita” by Nabokov, “a man whose whole life is stamped forever by his impression of a young girl.” (No, I am not making this up. And — just a guess — Epstein was probably already familiar with the novel.)

The emails include real-time texting with US Virgin Islands Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett while she was soliciting public testimony from former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, live on C-SPAN.

“Great outfit,” he texted her during the 2019 hearing, later advising: “Cohen brought up RONA — keeper of the secrets,” referring to Rhona Graff, Trump's longtime executive assistant, before pushing her to ask about other “henchmen” in the Trump organization.

At the time these emails were being exchanged, Epstein had already pleaded guilty to procuring a girl younger than 18 for prostitution and sentenced to 18 months in prison (serving only partially). That was in 2008. By the 2010s he was back in the saddle, with dinner invitations accepted, his private jet sought after — and apparently his friendship and advice.

In March 2019, Summers whined to Epstein that a woman had “blown off” a weekend plan and complained about “being the friend without benefits.”

Epstein replied with his best dating advice:  “She's smart … making you pay for past errors … you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring … no whining showed strength.”

Just a few months after this exchange, Epstein was arrested again, this time by the feds, on charges of sex trafficking. As a reminder, the search of his Manhattan townhouse at the time turned up evidence of sex trafficking and “hundreds—and perhaps thousands — of sexually suggestive photographs of fully — or partially —nude females,” according to the indictment. In a locked safe, there were CDs with handwritten labels: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes 1,” and “Girl pics nude.”

“So many people tried to ingratiate themselves with him,” observed Julie K. Brown, the intrepid journalist from The Miami Herald who first exposed Epstein's crimes and has doggedly pursued the story long after. She hopped on the phone with me on Sunday.

I asked Brown if she thought the emails validated those who believed in wacky Pizzagate-style theories (where Hillary Clinton was bizarrely accused of participating in a pedophile ring).

“What do you mean by conspiracy? (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Epstein — that was a conspiracy,” she said. “And that's exactly the way they should be looked at. He got away with this. And our criminal justice system is broken. People who have money and power get away with crimes. That's just a fact. [The email trove] shows that people are willing to overlook even the worst crime if they think that somehow they're going to benefit.”

She added: “It's what they call the swamp.”

The swamp is specifically what Donald Trump promised to clean up. But he and Epstein are the swamp. We already knew about the likes of Bill Gates, Bill Clinton and ex-Prince Andrew. But these emails suggest a much wider group of elites who accepted Epstein as fine company.

You remember the scene in “Eyes Wide Shut” when Tom Cruise finds that weird orgy mansion with masks and creepy rituals? I always found that scene eye-rolling. But can we honestly argue that Epstein's Pedophile Island isn't just like that? It's the deep state network depicted in “One Battle After Another” with sex instead of racism as the social glue. And it validates what has animated so much of the MAGA movement and the populist anger among progressives: the belief that the system is rigged. That regular people cannot get access to the byways of power or, eventually, money.

This is the antithesis of democracy.

I used to scoff at the notion that there was a vast conspiracy of men — from public figures to shadowy spooks — who trafficked in women across the world. I don't any more.

The question is: What are we going to do about it?

Here's a new PSA released by Epstein survivors:

🎦 Happy 83rd birthday to one of my favorite film directors, Martin Scorsese! I will never stop loving ‘Goodfellas,' even though it does feel like we're living through a real-life mob boss movie right now (!)

Good morning! Mehdi here, frantically trying to finish writing this Monday morning email before I head out for an exclusive sitdown interview with a big name in the news right now. Check out your inboxes for that ‘Mehdi Unfiltered' interview later this week. You won't want to miss it!

In today's ‘First Draft,' the Epstein revelations get weirder and weirder; the Department of Homeland Security names a vicious immigration raid after a classic children's book; the UN Security Council votes on Gaza; and Donald Trump escalates his war on… wait, what… Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Picture the scene. Imagine it is, say, December 2022. A high-profile, convicted child sex offender who once partied with President Joe Biden is emailing a friend. “I am the one able to take him down,” the sex offender writes, referring to his old pal Biden, who now holds the most powerful office in the country.

Just seven months later, in July 2023, the sex offender is arrested and charged by the Biden administration with sex trafficking of minors. A month later, the sex offender is found dead in his cell, in federal custody. It turns out the prison guards didn't check on him that night, and are later found to have falsified the records. The cameras outside the cell malfunctioned, too. And the CCTV footage that does emerge later is missing more than 60 crucial seconds.

What do you think Donald Trump, the Republican Party, and Fox would have said in response? Would they have accepted an instant ruling of suicide from Biden's attorney general, delivered six days before the official ruling from the medical examiner?

Of. Course. Not.

They would have screamed ‘Murder!' They would have accused Joe Biden of having his former friend killed in prison and then covering it up. They would have repeatedly pointed to the email showing the dead man claimed to be “the one able to take [Biden] down.” We all would have been subjected to one deranged conspiracy theory after another from the denizens of MAGAworld.

And yet what I describe above is exactly what did happen between a convicted child sex offender and a sitting president. But it was, of course, Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump, not Joe Biden.

It was Trump who partied with Epstein. And it was Epstein who suggested he had the goods on Trump that “could take him down.”

In December 2018, the Department of Justice and the FBI were investigating the financier over allegations of sex trafficking in the wake of a Miami Herald investigation into his sweetheart plea deal in 2008.

“It will all blow over!” an unidentified person wrote to Epstein on Dec. 3, 2018. “They're really just trying to take down Trump and doing whatever they can to do that...!”

“yes thx,” Epstein replied. “its wild. because i am the one able to take him down.”

Seven months later, in July 2019, Epstein was charged and arrested by the Trump DOJ, and a month later, he was found dead in his cell in federal custody. It was Trump's Attorney General Bill Barr who was quick to label Epstein's death an “apparent suicide.”

And it is Trump who, up until last night, was repeatedly and angrily refusing to release the Epstein files – despite pledging to do exactly that while running for the presidency last year. (Late last night, the president did a shameless U-turn, realizing that dozens of House Republicans were about to go against him on the Epstein files vote, and instead called on them to “vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide.”)

“Nothing to hide”? I have to be honest. I have spent my career resisting conspiracy theories: about 9/11, moon landings, and more. But the Jeffrey Epstein saga may have finally made a conspiracy theorist out of me.

Now, some of you might be wondering: how can we really believe wild conspiracy theories about murder, child rape, and top elected officials, as if we're living in some sort of episode of ‘Scandal' or ‘House of Cards'? But the real question is: how can we not? How can we not entertain conspiracy theories about the death of the world's most famous child sex offender when we see the world's most powerful man frantically spending weeks pressuring members of his own party to vote against the release of all the records, throwing his own loyal allies under the bus in the process, and ordering blatantly partisan investigations into only his political opponents?

How can we not entertain conspiracy theories when Donald Trump's name appears in the Epstein emails and files released by the House Oversight Committee more than anyone else? When those emails show Jeffrey Epstein saying the president “knew about the girls” and that Trump is the “dog that hasn't barked”?

How can we not entertain conspiracy theories about a dead pedophile who was a close friend of the president, especially when that president is also a convicted criminal himself and was found liable for sexual abuse by a jury of his peers in New York?

This should be the biggest story in the country, if not the world. By a country mile. It is a bigger political and criminal scandal than Watergate, Whitewater, and Iran-Contra rolled into one. It merits nonstop, round-the-clock attention, outrage, and journalistic scrutiny. (We here at Zeteo are playing our part and have provided to the public a searchable online database of the entire set of new Epstein files and emails.)

The great irony, of course, is that the MAGA movement spent the past decade furiously insisting that a secret cabal of politicians has been covering up child sex crimes, and it turns out they may have been right, but what they didn't realize is that the cover-up is coming from inside the house. Yet the same conservatives who accused Bill and Hillary Clinton of murdering their opponents now have little to say about the ridiculously suspicious death of Jeffrey Epstein in federal (read: Trump) custody.

To be clear: I am not saying Donald Trump had Jeffrey Epstein killed. I am saying that if the situation were reversed, there is no doubt that Donald Trump would definitely be claiming Joe Biden had Jeffrey Epstein killed.

“Operation Charlotte's Web”: Border Patrol said it arrested 81 people across North Carolina's largest city in the Trump administration's latest assault on immigrants. Yes, DHS really named an immigration raid involving masked agents detaining people near grocery stores, churches, and apartment buildings, after a classic children's novel!

Trump big bucks: Trump bought over $80 million in corporate and municipal bonds from late August to early October, and they include investments in sectors that profit from his MAGA policies. According to the latest disclosures, he made over 175 purchases in about 35 days.

War on Venezuela: Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday night that the Venezuela-based Cartel de los Soles will be designated as a foreign terrorist organization. The announcement came just hours after a major US aircraft carrier entered the Caribbean Sea, in a flex of military strength.

War on women: South Carolina is weighing the most oppressive abortion measure in the US. Under the bill, anyone who gets an abortion or assists someone would face up to 30 years in prison. It would also limit in vitro fertilization and potentially restrict some contraception methods like IUDs.

No more flight cuts: The FAA ended its mandatory flight cuts as of 6 am today, after a flurry of air traffic issues during the shutdown. The announcement comes just in time for the hectic holiday travel season.

Which Trump attorney general's father ran the school where Jeffrey Epstein began his career?

Keep your eyes out for the answer below!

Death sentence in custody: At least 94 Palestinians have died in Israeli custody since Oct. 7, according to the Physicians for Human Rights–Israel (PHRI). The majority of those who died were civilians, PHRI noted, adding that this number is likely a vast undercount. 

UN to vote on ceasefire: The UN Security Council is set to vote on a US-led resolution on the establishment of the International Stabilization Force (ISF), which would be deployed to Gaza to help implement the next phase of the ceasefire agreement. Just yesterday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu engaged in a last-minute effort to rewrite a portion of the resolution after the US incorporated a line to enable a “pathway” for Palestinian statehood.

Palestinians push for self-determination: The National Commission for Palestinian Popular Action came out against the UN resolution, emphasizing that Gaza's future must be decided by its people rather than the externally imposed transitional administration as proposed in the resolution.

And in the occupied West Bank… Israeli settlers stole Palestinian residents' agricultural equipment in Al-Mughayyir, a village near Ramallah, in the latest attack on this year's olive harvest season. Netanyahu attempted to downplay the settler violence in the area, saying it's only “caused by a minority.”

“I want it to be the Manchin to Mamdani party. I want it to be inclusive.” 

Inclusive is one thing, but is Governor Gavin Newsom, the man that a growing number of pundits view as the next Democratic presidential nominee, really aligning himself with perhaps the most conservative Democrat in the Senate in the 21st century? Come on!

🇧🇩 Ex-Bangladeshi leader sentenced to death: A special tribunal in Bangladesh sentenced ousted former leader Sheikh Hasina to death over the deadly crackdown on last year's student uprising. Up to 1,400 people may have been killed in the protests, according to the UN. Hasina, who called the trial a “politically motivated charade,” remains in India, which has not responded to previous requests by Bangladesh to extradite her. 

🇨🇱 Chile's polarizing election: A communist and hard-right contender will compete for Chile's presidency in a runoff vote next month after no candidate secured a winning margin in Sunday's election.

🇱🇧🇮🇱 Israel attacks southern Lebanon: An Israeli drone strike on a car in Al-Mansouri, near Tyre, killed a school principal, Lebanese media reported. Israeli troops also opened fire on UN peacekeepers, claiming to have misidentified them. No injuries were reported. The UN said it's the third time Israel has attacked the peacekeepers in the last three months.

🇸🇩 Genocide in Sudan: The Sudanese Armed Forces have recaptured the Kazqil and Um Dam Haj Ahmed territories in the North Kordofan state from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This comes as the RSF is reportedly burning or burying numerous bodies to cover up their genocidal violence against civilians.

🇺🇦 Strikes in Kyiv: UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the Russian missile and drone strikes on Kyiv that took place on Friday, which reportedly killed at least six people, injured several civilians, and damaged buildings in the area.

I spoke to activists Alon-Lee Green and Sally Abed from ‘Standing Together,' an Israeli grassroots movement that aims to bring together Palestinian and Jewish communities against occupation and discrimination. They're taking on the far-right Israeli government at home but also facing criticism from some pro-Palestine groups in the diaspora. 

It's a conversation you won't want to miss - and it'll be in your inbox later today. 

Who would've thought we'd see the day that Donald Trump went fully on the attack against one of his closest MAGA allies in Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom he now calls a “traitor?

On CNN's ‘State of the Union,' Dana Bash pushed Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on why she hasn't spoken out against Trump's vicious and threatening rhetoric until it was directed at her. She responded: “Dana, I think that's fair criticism. And I would like to say, humbly, I'm sorry for taking part in the toxic politics.”

On that note, Rep. Ro Khanna said on NBC's ‘Meet the Press' that Trump is losing touch with his own base, pointing to the president's un-endorsement of MTG and comments from the MAGA clan: “All these people who were on his side are now saying, ‘Mr. President, what happened to you?'”

Republicans will literally say anything to avoid answering questions head-on. CBS's Margaret Brennan pressed Senator Bill Cassidy on whether or not he regretted voting to confirm RFK as the Health and Human Services secretary. His response: “You live life forward. Again, you just do. Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day.”

The Trump administration does not seem to understand the concept of checks and balances. When asked about the White House's back-up plan in the case that the Supreme Court rules against the tariffs, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox's Maria Bartiromo that the tariffs were Trump's “signature policy” and that “the Supreme Court does not interfere with a president's signature policy.”

Monday, Nov. 17: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is set to make his first US visit since the murder of Saudi journalist and US resident Jamal Khashoggi, meeting Trump at the White House to hash out a defense deal and discuss his kingdom's possible entry into the Abraham Accords. And on ABC's ‘The View,' Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie are expected to discuss their co-sponsoring of the petition to release the Epstein files.

Tuesday, Nov. 18: House Republican leaders are planning to hold a vote on that Khanna/Massie bipartisan legislation to force the full release of the Epstein files by the Trump DOJ. 

Wednesday, Nov. 19: A US federal judge is expected to weigh ex-FBI Director James Comey's bid to get his criminal case tossed. In Vienna, Austria, the International Atomic Energy Agency's 25-nation Board of Governors will meet, as the agency presses Tehran to resume full inspections of its nuclear facilities after disruptions linked to US and Israeli strikes.

Friday, Nov. 21: Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton is scheduled to appear in federal court for an initial status conference after pleading not guilty to mishandling national defense information.

Saturday, Nov. 22: World leaders will convene in Johannesburg at the G20 Summit. Trump said no US government official would be in attendance. The agenda: global economic chaos, climate cash, and whether anyone can agree on anything.

“Trump is the dog that didn't bark” he thought to himself minutes before he was strangled to death. 

That's your Goodfellas scene. 

“The great irony, of course, is that the MAGA movement spent the past decade furiously insisting that a secret cabal of politicians has been covering up child sex crimes, and it turns out they may have been right, but what they didn't realize is that the cover-up is coming from inside the house. Yet the same conservatives who accused Bill and Hillary Clinton of murdering their opponents now have little to say about the ridiculously suspicious death of Jeffrey Epstein in federal (read: Trump) custody.”

Hassan, I couldn't agree more.  It's definitely coming from inside the house.  Based on nothing, a conspiracy theory metastasized about a secret cabal led by Hillary, who were a running a child sex ring from a DC pizza place in the basement.  

A MAD man eventually stormed and shot up the place: Cosmo Pizza.  He was looking for the kids in the basement.  Cosmo has no basement and the only kids were with their parents eating pizza.

Yet, we have emails from Bannon, a staunch advocate for these conspiracies advising Epstein how to dodge the bad press and get back into Trump's good graces; and all we hear are crickets!

Trump has pardoned hardened criminals (J6th), rapists, pedophiles and Madoff styled Wall Street grifters.  And yet, nothing, nada, zilch when it comes to hearing from the far right and their entire media ecosystem for every crime they accuse democrats of committing.

Bottom line:  every accusation, is a confession!  IMHO…:)

Kathleen Rodgers disappeared from the Oroville area in 1973 (Calif DOJ photo)

OROVILLE, Calif. - The mysterious disappearance of a teenager from Butte County remains unsolved over half a century later.

Kathleen Edna Rodgers, a 16-year-old girl, vanished from her home in Thermalito in March 1973 after an argument with her stepmother, Elda Stevens.

The Butte County Sheriff's Office reported she had been living with friends and may have been dating Dale William Kirk at the time. Despite several attempts to locate her remains, Rodgers has not been found. Foul play is suspected.

Rodgers was last seen at her home on the 1500 block of Keko Street, near Grand Avenue west of Oroville. She stood 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighed 130 pounds.

Anyone with information regarding Kathleen Rodgers' disappearance is urged to contact the Butte County Sheriff's Office tip line at (530) 538-7671.

A concise essay explores the core reasons there is so much corruption and manipulation in our world and gives inspiring ideas on what we can do to create a brighter future.  

This thought-provoking piece examines how the primary means for manipulating are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life. It also provides concrete ways we can turn all of this around. 

Don't lose hope. This inspiring essay reminds us in a most eloquent way that we were made for these times. Here's one paragraph of this poetic writing. 

""Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good.""

This week, the nonprofit Veterans Community Project (VCP) broke ground on its sixth tiny home village, this time in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to offer more military veterans a fresh start with housing and individualized care. Each 240-square-foot home is part of a larger community designed to help residents regain stability and independence. Since its founding in 2018 when they welcomed their first residents in Kansas City, VCP has helped hundreds of vets transition out of homelessness. VCP has set a new standard for how cities can address veteran homelessness, with its 85% success rate for vets who complete the program successfully and transition to sustainable permanent housing—all in an average of 335 days. Army combat veteran Dave Myers ... had never heard of VCP when his life was spinning out of control three years ago, addicted to drugs after returning home from war. He now smiles recalling a judge's words ordering him to become a volunteer after he got clean in prison: “He told me, ‘You're going to spend so much time with these guys that they're either going to love you or hate you ... I hope it's the former, and that they offer you a job after.'” Dave is now a full-time operations employee at VCP and is fulfilling his dream to help Veterans. “I was able to connect with our residents in some ways that not a lot of other people can. I've been in their shoes.” “This place saved me,” he said proudly.

We can't shift the chaos we're in until we name it. When we can recognize what's pushing us — in our personal lives and as a society — we already have a degree of freedom from it. Challenging information can paradoxically remind us of the greater good. It is the courage of the people and the love for the common good that brings these injustices to light—fueling open dialogue and constructive action.

A concise essay explores the core reasons there is so much corruption and manipulation in our world and gives inspiring ideas on what we can do to create a brighter future.  

This thought-provoking piece examines how the primary means for manipulating are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life. It also provides concrete ways we can turn all of this around. 

Don't lose hope. This inspiring essay reminds us in a most eloquent way that we were made for these times. Here's one paragraph of this poetic writing. 

""Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good.""

After deporting 238 Venezuelan immigrants to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador—likely in violation of court orders—the Trump administration has triggered an unprecedented showdown with the judicial branch to defend its ability to deport immigrants without presenting any evidence in court. This deportation effort constitutes a clear assault on civil liberties and due process rights. It also represents an arguably darker milestone: The US government is now in the business of trafficking migrants on the global market. On March 15, the Trump administration struck a $6 million agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in which the government traded 238 people to be warehoused for a year in the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo—CECOT—the “crown jewel” of Bukele's deeply antidemocratic domestic security platform. Even after conceding that they illegally deported one Maryland father who had already been granted protected status by an immigration judge, the Trump administration has said it cannot bring him home because he is now in foreign custody—meaning the executive branch is prioritizing its trade relationship with El Salvador over compliance with American law. [The Prisoners] will soon be enlisted in El Salvador's euphemistic “Zero Idleness” program, an obscure labor regime. There's a familiar word for forced prison labor: slavery. By effectively subsidizing and populating a modern penal colony, Trump has reignited the international slave trade. 

Note: Allegations that the US government is facilitating human trafficking under the guise of immigration enforcement are not new. Health and Human Services (HHS) whistleblower Tara Lee Rodas testified that ""the US government has become the middleman in a large scale, multibillion-dollar child trafficking operation that is run by bad actors seeking to profit off of the lives of children.” Watch our Mindful News Brief video on how the US government facilitates child trafficking at the border.

Lingering thunderstorms pose risk of mudslides in areas around Los Angeles recently ravaged by wildfires

A powerful atmospheric river weather system has mostly moved through California but not before causing at least six deaths and dousing much of the state.

Among the dead was a seven-year-old girl who was swept into the ocean by waves estimated up to 20ft at a state beach on Friday. The girl's father, 39-year-old Yuji Hu, of Calgary, Alberta, was killed while trying to save his daughter.

In northern California, in Sutter county, north of Sacramento, a 71-year-old man died after his vehicle was swept off a flooded bridge.

Much further south, a wooden boat believed to have been ferrying migrants toward the US from Mexico capsized in stormy seas off the coast of San Diego, leaving at least four people dead and four hospitalized.

The long plume of tropical moisture that formed over the Pacific Ocean began drenching the San Francisco Bay Area last Wednesday night and then unleashed widespread rain over southern California on Friday and Saturday.

Downtown LA saw more rain than any previous November, breaking a record previously set in 1985, the Los Angeles Times reported.

On Monday, lingering thunderstorms continued to pose the risk of mudslides in areas of Los Angeles county that were recently ravaged by wildfire.

“Due to the abundant rainfall the past couple of days, it will not take as much rainfall to cause additional flooding/rockslide conditions,” the National Weather Service said in a Sunday update. The agency advised the region on Monday to “be prepared for a soggy day”.

Rain was expected to continue through Tuesday, the weather service said, while another storm was forecast to arrive on Thursday.

South-east of Los Angeles there was flooding in the Palm Springs area and road closures throughout the desert area of the Coachella valley.

More than 4in of rain fell over coastal Santa Barbara county as the storm approached Los Angeles. Parts of the Sierra Nevada received more than a foot of snow.

Amid the climate crisis, warming oceans are supercharging such atmospheric river storms, making them deadlier and costlier.

Atmospheric rivers have long been important features of weather systems across the US west and are vital to replenishing the state's reservoirs and snowpack. But filled with enough moisture to rival flows at the mouth of the Mississippi – and often many times more – the strong systems that carry water across the Pacific also often cause the most destructive floods.

Robert Garcia, ranking member of House oversight committee, says president has ‘realized he is about to lose this Epstein vote' and calls for release of files

Trump urges Republicans to vote for release of Epstein files in surprise U-turn

Robert Garcia, the ranking member of the House oversight committee, which released the tranche of new Epstein documents last week, said that Donald Trump “has tried everything to kill our Jeffrey Epstein investigation”.

The Democrat went on to say: “Now [Trump's] panicking and has realized he is about to lose this Epstein vote to force the Department of Justice to release the files.

“Let's be crystal clear: Trump has the power to release all the files today,” Garcia added in a statment. “But instead, he wants to continue this cover-up and launch bogus new investigations to deflect and slow down our investigation. It won't work. We will get justice for the survivors.”

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has called for Harvard University to sever ties with its former president Larry Summers, in an interview with CNN. This comes as several emails between Summers and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein appeared in the trove of documents released by the House oversight committee last week. The pair maintained a friendship for years.

“For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,” Warren told CNN. “If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein's sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation's politicians, policymakers, and institutions – or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.”

Summers, who previously served as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, is now the subject of a new investigation that Trump initiated last week. The president instructed attorney general Pam Bondi to launch a probe into several Democrats and institutions after their names appeared in the latest tranche of documents, which included emails that seemed to suggest Trump himself might have known about Epstein's conduct.

In a short while, we'll hear from Donald Trump, as he meets with the White House taskforce about the 2026 World Cup.

We'll make sure to bring you the latest lines, as this will be the first chance reporters have to ask him questions since he seemed to pivot on House Republicans voting to release the full trove of justice department files on Jeffrey Epstein.

David Richardson, the acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), has resigned after a brief stint leading the agency, according to the Washington Post.

The Post cites people familiar with the matter, and notes that Richardson “kept a low profile and was known for frequently being inaccessible, including during the early hours of the flood disaster in Texas over the Fourth of July weekend”.

The Trump administration has been vocal about wanting to dismantle Fema, and Richardson's boss – homeland security secretary Kristi Noem – stopped him from doing interviews or answering other media requests, according to an official with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the Post condition of anonymity.

A US judge has found evidence of “government misconduct” in how a prosecutor aligned with Donald Trump secured criminal charges against former FBI director James Comey and ordered that grand jury materials be turned over to Comey's defense team.

Last week, prosecutors were ordered to produce a trove of materials from the investigation, with the court saying it was concerned that the US justice department's position on Comey had been to “indict first and investigate later”.

Comey is charged with lying to Congress in 2020 in a case filed days after the US president appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute the former FBI director and other perceived political enemies. He has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have argued that it is a vindictive prosecution brought at the direction of the Republican president and must be dismissed.

Former national security adviser and noted Trump adversary John Bolton said that he supports “the idea of returning the government of Venezuela to its own people” in an interview with CNN today. But he remains “troubled” because he doesn't “see what the plan is”.

He added:

If it's simply about illegal narcotics, that's one thing. But it seems to be about overthrowing Maduro. Why else bring the Gerald R Ford carrier strike group from the European theater to the Caribbean? Trump has now put the gun on the table. The question is, is he going to use it or not?

It's worth remembering that FBI searched Bolton's home earlier this year, and he was later charged with transmitting and retaining highly classified information under the Espionage Act. He pleaded not guilty, following his indictment last month.

Several of Jeffrey Epstein's survivors appear in a new public service announcement to encourage House lawmakers to vote for the complete release of justice department files on the late sex offender.

In the video, produced by anti-trafficking organization World Without Exploitation, the survivors hold pictures of their younger selves. “It's time to bring the secrets out of the shadows,” one says. The video ends with the screen reading: “Five administrations and we're still in the dark.”

Robert Garcia, the ranking member of the House oversight committee, which released the tranche of new Epstein documents last week, said that Donald Trump “has tried everything to kill our Jeffrey Epstein investigation”.

The Democrat went on to say: “Now [Trump's] panicking and has realized he is about to lose this Epstein vote to force the Department of Justice to release the files.

“Let's be crystal clear: Trump has the power to release all the files today,” Garcia added in a statment. “But instead, he wants to continue this cover-up and launch bogus new investigations to deflect and slow down our investigation. It won't work. We will get justice for the survivors.”

The US has said it will designate a putative Venezuelan drug cartel allegedly led by Nicolás Maduro as a foreign terrorist organization, as the Trump administration sent more mixed messages over its crusade against Venezuela's authoritarian leader.

The move to target the already proscribed group, the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns), was announced by Marco Rubio on Sunday. “Headed by the illegitimate Nicolás Maduro, the group has corrupted the institutions of government in Venezuela and is responsible for terrorist violence conducted by and with other designated FTOs as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe,” the US secretary of state tweeted, generating excitement among hardline adversaries of Maduro who interpreted the announcement as proof Washington was preparing to intensify its push to force the South American dictator from power.

But shortly after Rubio's pronouncement, those hopes were undermined when Trump hinted he might be prepared to negotiate with Maduro representatives. “We may be having some conversations with Maduro, and we'll see how that turns out. They would like to talk,” Trump told reporters.

As we reported earlier, 81 people were arrested by Customs and Border Protection officers in Charlotte, North Carolina, over the weekend. My colleague Victoria Bouloubasis reports that the Meckenburg county sheriff, Gary McFadden, said on Sunday that he was not surprised by federal agents' actions this weekend. “This is something I have seen, something I have been battling repeatedly,” he said.

McFadden confirmed that his office will not assist ICE or border patrol with law enforcement actions. That also means the county cannot intervene in any federal arrests.

“Border patrol are going to do what they are being tasked to do. We cannot stop that,” he said. “I would suggest that people stay out of their way.”

The sheriff, who is Black, acknowledged that “some communities welcome this” in Mecklenburg county “and the others are living in fear and anxiety for the rest of this week, maybe the rest of this year. Mentally it's unbelievable to live in fear every day. African Americans can maybe understand it a little better than other people.”

Joe Walsh, the former Republican congressman from Illinois, has offered some words of advice to Marjorie Taylor Greene, as she continues to speak out against Donald Trump's claims that she's a “traitor” for pushing for the complete release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.

“As a onetime divisive right-wing political asshole, I publicly came out against Trump & stopped being a divisive asshole over 7yrs ago,” Walsh wrote. A reminder, that the former representative was a loyal Republican until the end of Trump's first term when he mounted a short-lived primary challenge against the president in 2020. Walsh has since been a vocal critic of the Trump administration and became a registered Democrat this year.

“I've spent every day these past 7yrs proving the sincerity of my conversion, and doing all I can to defeat Trump/Trumpism. MTG will have to walk down this same road,” he added in his post on X.“ I appreciate her pledging to no longer be a divisive asshole, but now she's gotta prove it.”

The BBC chair, Samir Shah, has told staff that the corporation is “determined” to fight any defamation action brought by Donald Trump. The president has no case, Shah says.

In a note to staff seen by PA Media, Shah says:

There is a lot being written, said and speculated upon about the possibility of legal action, including potential costs or settlements.

In all this we are, of course, acutely aware of the privilege of our funding and the need to protect our licence fee payers, the British public.

I want to be very clear with you – our position has not changed. There is no basis for a defamation case and we are determined to fight this.

Last week I took the opportunity to speak with the executive team and am reassured of their resolute focus on ensuring the BBC continues to deliver on behalf of audiences and staff.

I know they plan to spend as much time as possible with their teams over the coming weeks to reinforce the importance of that work and answer your questions.

As her fallout with the president continues over her push for the full release of the Epstein files, Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said that the “hoax pizza deliveries have started now, to my house and my family members”.

She also noted that her construction company's office building received a “pipe bomb threat”.

“Unfortunately, I've been down this road before. As a matter of fact, as I campaigned all over the country and defended President Trump, I received dozens of swatting calls on my house,” the lawmaker said in a post on X. “When the President of the United States irresponsibly calls a Member of Congress of his own party, traitor, he is signaling what must be done to a traitor.”

Donald Trump is in Washington today. As we noted earlier, he'll hold a meeting with the 2026 World Cup taskforce in the Oval Office at 2pm ET. We'll bring you the latest lines from that meeting, particularly as it will be the first event open to the press since the president's apparent U-turn on the House releasing the Epstein files.

Later, Trump will deliver remarks at McDonald's impact summit. This will be in DC, and there will be a number of Democratic leaders speaking and in attendance.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taipei has been ranked the world's 25th-richest city this year, with a GDP of US$867.83 billion, business magazine CEOWORLD said.

Taipei was the only Taiwanese city to make it into the top 100 of the survey, which ranked 300 metropolises worldwide.

“They are not just cities; they are economic ecosystems shaping how money moves, technology evolves and policy decisions ripple through the markets,” CEOWORLD said.

Other Taiwanese cities were among the 300 richest cities in the world, with Taichung ranking 116th with a GDP of US$436 billion, Kaohsiung at 117th (US$433 billion), Taoyuan at 152nd (US$334 billion) and Tainan at 174th (US$288 billion).

Tokyo was this year's richest city in the world, with a “staggering” GDP of US$2.55 trillion, surpassing New York in second place, the magazine said.

The Japanese capital remains a benchmark for operational excellence, technological sophistication and disciplined economic governance, it said.

“Japan's capital integrates innovation with infrastructure like few others — its transportation systems, financial networks and industrial supply chains operate with unmatched precision,” CEOWORLD said.

Rounding out the top 10 (from third-richest city) were: Los Angeles (Long Beach, Anaheim), London, Seoul, Paris, Chicago (Naperville, Elgin), Osaka-Kobe, San Francisco (Oakland, Berkeley) and Shanghai, the magazine said.

The top 10 accounted for nearly one-third of the global GDP, it added.

Other high-ranking Asian cities included Beijing (11th), Singapore (16th), Shenzhen (21st), Chongqing (26th), Guangzhou (27th), Hong Kong (29th), Nagoya (30th) and Bangkok (46th), CEOWORLD said.

“Asia's dominance in the 2025 rankings reflects a broader shift in global economic gravity eastward,” the magazine said.


LOW RISK:
                                        Most nations do not extradite people accused of political crimes, and the UN says extradition can only happen if the act is a crime in both countries, an official said                                        China yesterday issued wanted notices for two Taiwanese influencers, accusing them of committing “separatist acts” by criticizing Beijing, amid broadening concerns over China's state-directed transnational repression.
The Quanzhou Public Security Bureau in a notice posted online said police are offering a reward of up to 25,000 yuan (US$3,523) for information that could contribute to the investigation or apprehension of pro-Taiwanese independence YouTuber Wen Tzu-yu (溫子渝),who is known as Pa Chiung (八炯) online, and rapper Chen Po-yuan (陳柏源).
Wen and Chen are suspected of spreading content that supported secession from China, slandered Chinese policies that benefit Taiwanese and discrimination against Chinese spouses of                                    


PROMOTION:
                                        Travelers who want a free stopover must book their flights with designated travel agents, such as Lion Travel, Holiday Tours, Cola Tour and Life Tours                                        Air Canada yesterday said it is offering Taiwanese travelers who are headed to North America free stopovers if they transit though airports in Japan and South Korea. 
The promotion was launched in response to a potential rise in demand for flights to North America in June and July next year, when the US, Canada and Mexico are scheduled to jointly host the FIFA World Cup, Air Canada said. 
Air Canada offers services to 13 of the 16 host cities of the tournament's soccer games, including Toronto and Vancouver; Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey in Mexico; Atlanta, Georgia; Boston; Dallas; Houston;

""The proposed sale will improve the recipient's capability to meet current and future threats by maintaining the operational readiness of the recipient's fleet of F-16, C-130,"" and other aircraft, the Pentagon said in a statement.

Masaaki Kanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau, headed to Beijing on Monday for talks with his Chinese counterpart over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's recent remark about Taiwan.

Kanai is scheduled to meet with Liu Jinsong, director general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Department, on Tuesday. The two are expected to discuss Takaichi's remark during a recent Diet deliberation in which she said a Taiwan contingency could constitute a survival-threatening situation for Japan.

Amid a deepening rift in Japan-China relations, Tokyo hopes to calm the situation through diplomatic consultations with Beijing.

In response to China's demand that Takaichi retract her remarks, Kanai is expected to seek Beijing's understanding by explaining that her comments do not contradict the Japanese government's established stance on the matter.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry has also issued an advisory urging Chinese citizens to refrain from traveling to Japan for the time being. Kanai will also ask Beijing to take appropriate measures regarding the move.

In connection with Takaichi's remark, Chinese Consul General in Osaka Xue Jian said in a post on X, “There would be no choice but to cut off that filthy head without a moment's hesitation.” Kanai is expected to lodge a protest over the post.

China's education ministry on Sunday issued a warning urging Chinese citizens planning to study in Japan to carefully reconsider such arrangements. Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said Monday that the Japanese government has answered by calling for an appropriate response from China.

“The announcement, intended to stifle people-to-people exchanges between Japan and China, is incompatible with the overall direction of promoting a mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests confirmed between the leaders of the two countries,” Kihara said at a press conference on Monday morning.

“We will continue to closely monitor the situation as it develops, including the impact of China's actions, and take appropriate measures,” he added.

Out of thousands of items being sold off from Hudson's Bay Co., auctioneers chose a handful of paintings as the cream of the crop. Take a look before they're going, going, gone

Touting the comfort of a vintage wool coat or the allure of a collectible Barbie doll is, to put it mildly, not typically part of David Heffel's job. But as Heffel Fine Art Auction House sifts through hundreds of pieces of ephemera from the collection of the collapsed retailer Hudson's Bay Co., it is not exactly business as usual.

“I tried on a striped wool coat for the first time – I couldn't believe how warm it was,” Mr. Heffel said. “There's going to be items here for everybody.”

With more than 1,700 pieces of art and more than 2,700 artifacts, the Bay collection will take months to process and sell following the company's demise.

Bay Watch by Charles Pachter is the most recently made item on the auction block; he painted it in 2011, colouring the sky with the stripes of an HBC blanket.

Items will be grouped into online sales that will launch on Heffel's website every few weeks. The first online auctions opened on Nov. 12, featuring Bay blankets; paintings depicting the Bay's history; portraits, including those of former HBC governors and of King Charles II; and works by Canadian artists such as William Kurelek and Maurice Galbraith Cullen.

Future sales will feature hundreds of pieces of the Bay's retail-era artifacts, including signage, coats and toys. And this week, an in-person auction will present 27 pieces of art that the team chose as the highlights of the collection.

The 355-year-old company was never known as one of corporate Canada's most prominent art collectors. (Its historical collection, stretching back to the days of the fur trade, is vast and significant, and was largely donated in the '90s to the Archives of Manitoba and the Manitoba Museum.)

But there are some items of note up for sale. Here are some selections of the lot that buyers will bid on in person at the auction.

With a report from Kate Taylor

When Weihong (Ruby) Liu made a $69.1-million play for former Hudson's Bay stores, her supporters said she could “save Canadian retail” – but skeptical landlords weren't buying it.

Guests at an Istanbul hotel have reportedly been moved after a German family who stayed there died of suspected poisoning. The source of the apparent poisoning has yet to be established.

A hotel in Istanbul has been evacuated following the deaths of a German-Turkish mother and her two children from suspected poisoning, local media have reported.

Another two tourists staying at the same hotel as the family in the Fatih neighborhood of Turkey's largest city were hospitalized on Saturday after displaying symptoms of nausea and vomiting, BirGun newspaper said.

The father from the family from Hamburg, which was holidaying in Istanbul, died on Monday after several days at a hospital in critical condition, the city's regional health chief Abdullah Emre Guner said late Monday on X.

Although the main focus has so far been on food poisoning as a likely cause of death, investigators have also found that a ground-floor room of the hotel had recently been sprayed with chemicals, likely pesticides, the Hurriyet news website reported Saturday. 

Police have detained a hotel employee and two pest control workers, it added.

The dailies Cumhuriyet and Sabah have both reported that a baker working near the hotel has also been arrested, meaning that eight people have now been arrested in connection with the deaths.

When asked by CNN Türk about possible food poisoning at the hotel, one of the hotel owners said there was no restaurant there and that only water was available to guests.

Forensic investigators have already taken samples of the drinking water.

The family fell ill after eating stuffed mussels from a street vendor and soup and a dish made from calf intestines, known in Turkish as kokorec, at another shop, according to the daily Sabah newspaper.

They are also known to have bought Turkish delight and water, while the Anadolu news agency reported that they also ate chicken.

The two children, aged 3 and 6, were admitted to hospital on Wednesday and treated for nausea and vomiting, but were initially discharged. All four members of the family were readmitted in the night when the children's condition deteriorated.

The children died shortly afterward, followed by the mother. 

The three were buried on Saturday in a town in the western Turkish province of Afyonkarahisar, according to Anadolu.

Four people who sell street food are among the eight arrested in connection with the case.

To kick off our week of coverage from the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, we play video of a major protest that took place Saturday, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the host city Belém to demand urgent climate action. The Indigenous-led action was the first major climate protest at a United Nations climate conference since 2021; protests were banned by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan, the three previous host countries. Demonstrators denounced corporate greed, war and imperialism, while demanding urgent action to reduce use of fossil fuels and to respect Indigenous sovereignty. “The answer is us,” said Lucía Ixchíu, a Maya K'iche' environmental defender. “We know that we have the solutions.”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We're broadcasting from the U.N. climate summit — that's COP30 — from the Brazilian city of Belém. It's the gateway to the Amazon. Leaders and delegates from more than 190 countries have entered a second week of negotiations. On Saturday, Democracy Now! was in the streets of Belém as tens of thousands of protesters gathered demanding urgent climate action. The Great People's March was the first major climate protest at a U.N. climate summit since 2021. The three previous climate summits were hosted by nations that ban public actions: Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan.

MARÍA INÉS TARACENA: We're in the streets of Belém, where the U.N. climate summit is taking place. We're halfway through the negotiations of CO30. It's a Saturday. Thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding urgent climate action. We spoke to several of them.

GIOVANI DEL PRETE: My name is Giovani del Prete. I'm from Brazil, from São Paulo. I'm here with all the people from world. We have here gathered more than 60 countries here. And we have gathered in UFPA University the real COP summit here, the People's Summit, in the university here of the state of Pará. We have gathered there 30,000 people from 60 countries. Here we are denouncing all the false solutions in the COP30. We are saying that the financial market was in the official COP30, and the real people and the real solutions were here. We are here, seen here on the streets.

So, this is our message to the world: against the war, against the imperialist invasion. We are seeing U.S. right now just launching a new military attempt against Venezuela, against Colombia. And this is what matters. There is no peace, there is no possibility of environmental solutions with war, with fossil fuels. And this is what we are here denouncing, and more than denouncing the problems, but also presenting proposals for life, in the peoples, the peasants, the women movement. We have the diversity of all societies here. So, this is what we are doing here: fight for our life.

AMAZONIAN ACTIVIST 1: [translated] I am an Amazonian woman. I am an activist in the peasant women's movement. And we are here at the global march in defense of life, in defense of our territories. And we will not negotiate our rights, because there is no living territory if we are not alive. We will not negotiate our rights.

LUCÍA IXCHÍU: OK, I am Lucía Ixchíu, a Maya K'iche' woman from Guatemala. I'm part of the Amazon Flotilla and also Festivales Media in Guatemala. I'm staying in the march supporting Indigenous grassroots organizations in Brazil, but also defending and denouncing the ecocide in Guatemala and in the different parts of the continent. I'm also part of the Yaku Mama Flotilla. We traveled for more than 31 days from the Amazon River from Ecuador to Belém, and we see the ecocide there. So, for us, it's very important to be here and stand together, because we have to take action together for the environmental issue.

MARÍA INÉS TARACENA: Why is that sense of solidarity so important, especially among Indigenous leaders from across the region and around the world?

LUCÍA IXCHÍU: Well, one of the most important things for me for this COP is the action and the solidarity that we are building together as Indigenous leaders and land defenders from different parts of the world, because we know that the answer is us. We know that we are the lead alternatives. We have the answers and we have the response for all the devastation and the destruction for the climate crisis. And we are making this together. We know that we have the solutions.

DELMAH WELLINGTON NDHLOVU: My name is Delmah Wellington Ndhlovu from Zimbabwe, a smallholder farmer, a peasant farmer from my country. I'm part of the international movement of La Via Campesina. We are here because, as La Via Campesina, we are concerned of the false solutions that you are being given. We are concerned about the power that is still playing in the COP. We feel the power is not equal. People are — the corporate capture of the system has gone high. And so, we have come to lend our voice to say this is high time it should stop. People should look at the people first, not at money, not at anything, but just look at the people and the farmers. We are the majority, even in any country. Therefore, we should be considered first. That's why we are here.

ERINALDO RODRIGUES: [translated] My name is Erinaldo Rodrigues. I am the chief of the Miritituba village. And the message I want to tell the government is on this banner. It's for them to leave us, the Tapajós, in peace. They take away our food, the food of our children and grandchildren. And that is our territory. That is a sacred place, where we must fight until the end of our lives, until we die, for that river, for the stones, for the rock formations. All of that serves as a symbol of our ancestors. That place is a legend to us. And I want to tell the government to look out for us, because stop harming us in our region, in our Amazon rainforest.

LARISSA SACRAMENTO: Our families are dying. Our territories are dying. Our elders are dying. And in our country, we and the nature, we are the same thing. We are not separate. So, our lives, our spirituality and our mind, our feeling is totally connected to the rivers. We are the waters, people of the waters, fishmen and fishwomen. Our life is the river. Our life is the ocean. And the ocean and the ocean's animals have no voice. We are the voice of the water, of the water animals. And they are dying and crying. And no, that needs to stop right now.

AMAZONIAN ACTIVIST 2: It's just really important to point out that there's a lot of focus in Amazon, in the forest, but there's also a need to focus on the riverine communities, on the quilombola communities, and also on the other communities from other areas that are also guardians of our ecosystem and ecosystems that are very important, like the fisherfolk in the coast and the fisherfolk in the mangroves. So, this is a movement that represents them.

TOM GOLDTOOTH: Tom Goldtooth from Minnesota, United States, Indigenous Environmental Network. We are a global, international network of Indigenous people. We're standing here here with our relatives from the Global South, from the Amazon to speak with one mind and one voice and one heart. We're demanding that all these fossil fuel lobbyists be removed. It's very unethical and immoral that there's more there than the Indigenous people here from the local regions. We have Indigenous people here who have to fight to get in, but we have these corporations that can just walk right in with no struggle. So we're declaring that the rights of Indigenous people be recognized and that there be climate action, action, real solutions. And we have that as Indigenous people.

EDWARDS CASTILLO-RODRÍGUEZ: [translated] We are here to denounce the capitalist negotiations in the face of the climate crisis, which never manages to fulfill any agreements for controlling greenhouse gas emissions or establishing carbon sinks. Instead, it's pure capitalist business interests with no results. We must insist on mitigation and compensation, as well as adaptation. Climate justice is also necessary, and that implies compensation for the damage caused by the climate crisis, inflicted by capitalism and global imperialism. And, of course, solidarity with the people of Venezuela, who are being threatened with the use of force by a thug in a red tie and blue suit, but who only wants not freedom, not democracy, not humanitarian aid, but to plunder the resources — not only of Venezuela. They want to enter the Amazon through Venezuela, and they're coming to seize all of Latin America.

PROTESTERS: Fight for climate justice! Resist imperialism! Fight for climate justice! Resist imperialism!

RACHELLE JUNSAY: I'm Rachelle Junsay. I'm from the Philippines, and I'm with the Peoples Rising for Climate Justice. We're marching with the people of Belém today to demand accountability from the world leaders as they attend COP30. As we can see, a lot of wars and occupations has been happening all over the world, from Palestine to Sudan to Congo and other regions, West Papua and even in Asia. And with that, the ongoing ecocide is something that we should not tolerate, something that we should not allow. And so we're here demanding for these world leaders, for these imperialist nations to stop the U.S.-led wars, to stop their imperialist dominations over these countries, to stop the food blockades and to stop violating the human rights of those people and the environment.

Communities in the Philippines are devastated by flooding and corruption, and those are things that should have been talked about in the COP30. And yet we are seeing false solutions. We are seeing carbon markets that do not do justice to the people. Instead of putting the spotlight on the communities affected by the typhoons, it is the world leaders, it is the Global North imperialist nations that are taking up space. That's why the movement is here to get their space to demand accountability and to fight back against these world leaders who are dominating the space that should have been for the people and for the environment.

GIOVANI DEL PRETE: Why are we on the streets today? Can we answer that question, please? We are tired of false solutions. We are tired of corporate capture of the system. We are tired of being slaves in our own countries. I believe the power is in us to say no. As we stand together, let the COP know that we are concerned as peasants. Power to the people!

MARÍA INÉS TARACENA: From the streets of Belém, this is María Inés Taracena with Democracy Now!

AMY GOODMAN: Voices from the streets of Belém, here in Brazil, at Saturday's major Indigenous-led climate protest outside the U.N. climate summit, where we are right now. Special thanks to María Taracena, Sam Alcoff and Charina Nadura. When we come back, we'll speak to the heads of Amazon Watch and Oxfam Brazil. Stay with us.

Live Updates


            • At least 130 people were arrested in North Carolina's largest city over the weekend in the Department of Homeland Security's latest targeted immigration blitz, spearheaded by Customs and Border Protection and dubbed Operation Charlotte's Web.
    


• Amid the crackdown, the Supreme Court announced today a review of the court's first major immigration policy case of the term. Justices will review a controversial immigration policy adopted during the first Trump administration of turning away potential asylum seekers before they step foot on American soil.
    


            • The community of Charlotte is on edge: Students at a local high school plan a walkout Monday to protest the action, and a popular Colombian bakery remains closed after the owner says agents tackled people outside his shop.
    


            • Unlike other federal enforcement operations in Democratic-led cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, President Donald Trump made almost no prior mention of Charlotte, and local Democrats believe the action aims to “score political points.”
    


            • While police say violent crime has dropped by 20% this year in Charlotte, the city got nationwide attention this summer after Iryna Zarutska, 23, was stabbed to death without provocation on public transit. She was a refugee and the suspect a US citizen.
    


            Profiling North Carolinians “based on what they look like, including American citizens and those with no criminal records” puts communities at risk because it leaves violent criminals at large, former North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, wrote in a statement on X Monday.
    


            “I've prosecuted violent criminals and fought to keep them behind bars, so I know the importance of using federal resources to deport violent criminals and keep our borders strong,” he wrote, alleging what's happening with immigration sweeps are being done at random and based on physical appearance.
    


Remember: Cooper announced his Senate run late July, boosting the Democratic party's hopes of winning the seat, which was opened by retiring Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.
    


            Heightened anxiety is gripping a Charlotte suburb after Huntersville mayor Christy Clark said her office has received verified reports of Border Patrol activity in town, with officers allegedly targeting primarily Latino communities.
    


            When asked about Border Patrol activity in Huntersville and the potential deployment to other suburbs outside of the city, a DHS spokesperson said they “do not discuss future or potential operations” and said the agency will not stop enforcing the nation's laws “until every criminal illegal alien is arrested and removed from our country.”
    


            Clark, who also works at a local public elementary school, said she is aware of families keeping their children home out of fear that the adults in their households could be detained.
    


            She described the immigrant community as part of what makes the town a “beautiful” and “wonderful place to live and work,” adding that she is saddened and angered that some residents now fear being “taken from their families without due process.”
    


            North Carolina-based Muslim political groups issued a joint statement today publicly condemning the presence of federal agents engaging in an immigration crackdown in the state.
    


            Customs and Border Protection, along with the Department of Homeland Security, launched “Operation Charlotte's Web,” the newest immigration blitz, in Charlotte on Saturday.
    


            Warning of the possibility that “mosques and community spaces may be targeted,” the statement penned by the North Carolina chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Muslim American Public Affairs Council and Charlotte Muslim Caucus, presses community members to “stay safe during these times.”
    


            “We also urge you to carry your legal identification with you at all times and comply if asked to,” the statement says.
    


            There are approximately 50,000 Muslims living in the Charlotte metropolitan area, according to the Levine Museum of the New South, and at least 15 mosques.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Charlotte Police Department and the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office to inquire about any planned federal immigration operations at mosques and Islamic community centers in the Charlotte metropolitan area.
    


            Community organizers opposing the new immigration enforcement blitz in Charlotte, North Carolina, saw a similar operation in Chicago as warning of what their community could experience. It also gave them tools to respond.
    


            People in some Charlotte neighborhoods today were seen watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights.
    


            “It gives me great pleasure to know that our example has been useful to them,” wrote Ismael Cordová-Clough, an organizer in Evanston, Illinois – a community just north of Chicago that was the site of raids under Operation Midway Blitz.
    


            In Evanston, volunteer groups have been monitoring the area for immigration agents and handing out flyers asking people to report ICE activity, follow agents and record their activities.
    


            Operation Charlotte's Web is led by Border Patrol section chief Gregory Bovino, who also was in charge of the Chicago operation until late last week.
    


CNN's Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.



            Frustrated and saddened that some of his most loyal customers are now the targets of the immigration operation in Charlotte, David Rebolloso is keeping his laundromat open  — but locking the doors behind everyone that comes and goes.
    


            On Sunday, federal agents were in the parking lot of his business, North Tryon Laundromat, which is nestled in a strip mall that is primarily Latino owned, he said. Rebolloso was not there at the time, but witnesses told him agents chased some people out through the back door of his business, he said.
    


                    “People are just here peacefully trying to do their laundry, trying to do their chores and daily activities,” he said. “I know these folks as my customers, and I'm familiar with their stories, and I know them, and I'm pretty certain they're not … criminals. They're only here to make a living and try to get by.”
                





            Rebolloso isn't worried for his own safety as an American citizen but wouldn't be surprised if he was profiled based on the color of his skin, he said.
    


            To protect his customers, the United States Air Force veteran from Texas said he's keeping the doors to his business locked to regulate who comes in and out of the laundromat.
    


            “My laundromat is practically empty,” he said. “But we're open because people need to do laundry. Laundry does not discriminate.”
    


            Some of the people detained in Charlotte by US Border Patrol agents are being transferred to detention facilities in Georgia, a North Carolina-based immigration attorney said today.
    


            North Carolina doesn't have long-term detention facilities, so detainees are being moved to Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, and Folkston ICE Processing Center in Folkston, Georgia, immigration attorney Jeremy McKinney told CNN, citing accounts from people on the ground in Charlotte and attorneys working to locate detainees.
    


            Detainees are typically moved by Immigration and Customs Enforcement based on facility availability and space.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for more information.
    


            At least 130 people have been arrested amid the latest immigration crackdown in Charlotte, according to a DHS spokesperson.
    


            The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will review a controversial immigration policy adopted during the first Trump administration of turning away potential asylum seekers before they step foot on American soil, setting up the first major immigration policy case of the term.
    


            Federal law requires the government to process asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry. But in 2018, President Donald Trump's first administration began a policy known as “metering,” in which border agents simply turned back potential asylum seekers to Mexico before they entered the US.
    


            An immigrant rights group, Al Otro Lado, and several asylum seekers filed a lawsuit in California challenging the policy. An appeals court based in San Francisco sided with the migrants, and the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court in July.
    


            The practical impact of the litigation, at least for now, is limited at best. The Biden administration rescinded “metering” and instead began requiring most people seeking asylum to make an appointment before arriving at a port of entry.
    


            Read the full story here.
    


            At least 130 people have been arrested in North Carolina's largest city so far in “Operation Charlotte's Web,” the newest Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection led immigration blitz, according to a DHS spokesperson.
    


            “During the first two days of Operation Charlotte's Web, Border Patrol arrested over 130 illegal aliens who have all broken the immigration laws of our country,” a DHS spokesperson told CNN in an email.
    


            When asked how many of those arrested were undocumented immigrants and how many had previous criminal records, the DHS spokesperson responded, “Criminal records of those arrested include known gang membership, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony larceny, simple assault, hit and run, possession of stolen goods, shoplifting, DUI, DWI, and illegal re-entry after prior deportation, a felony.”
    


            CNN has also reached out to CBP, ICE and HSI for those numbers.
    


            Before it even started, the announcement that an immigration enforcement operation would arrive in Charlotte — right on the heels of a weekslong operation that led to hundreds of arrests and fierce protests in Chicago — provoked fear and anxiety in the city.
    


            Several businesses closed temporarily in the wake of the announced operation, among them a popular Colombian bakery that had closed its doors only once in the past 28 years.
    


            Manuel “Manolo” Betancur closed his family bakery Saturday after men in green uniforms chased and tackled people outside the shop, he told CNN. He said he isn't sure when he will reopen.
    


            The officers emerged from unmarked SUVs on Saturday morning, “jumping and taking people down in the street, just people that look like me,” Betancur said. He is a naturalized US citizen and said he's started carrying his passport with him everywhere he goes, “because I don't want to go through the trouble. I promised my wife and my kids I'm going to be back home tonight.”
    


            Betancur said he doesn't want his customers to risk a similar encounter with federal agents — not when they're just trying to buy cakes or pastries.
    


            “It's too risky and I don't want to carry on my shoulders the heaviness of maybe a kid to lose their father or their mother because they were on their way to a bakery to get a cake,” he told CNN's Sara Sidner this morning.
    


            Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino's crackdown on immigration is expected to continue apace in other Democratic-led cities after Charlotte.
    


            The next stop: New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.
    


            The president has talked about sending the National Guard to New Orleans, a Democratic-led city in a Republican-led state, as far back as September.  The city has a “crime problem,” he said. But the National Guard plan hasn't materialized, as efforts to deploy the National Guard in Chicago and Portland have largely been stymied by the courts.
    


            The New Orleans mayor's office has not responded to CNN's outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.
    


            Speaking to Fox News on Thursday from West Virginia — before the Charlotte operation was officially announced — Bovino floated a few cities that the Border Patrol could target next.
    


            “You're going to see us redeploy to — it could be New York, it could be Chicago, it could be Charlotte.”
    


            A US citizen drove at law enforcement during the federal immigration operation in Charlotte on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security said.
    


Video shared to X by DHS shows some of what happened.
    


            The driver of a large van drove at law enforcement “while they were conducting an operation” and immediately fled the scene — which led to a high-speed chase in the area, the DHS said.
    


Watch the clip here:



            During the chase the driver “attempted to ram into law enforcement vehicles” and eventually agents boxed him in, the DHS said. “As agents were boxing him in — the driver proceeded to ram law enforcement vehicles in an attempt to escape,” the agency said.
    


            One law enforcement officer was injured during the incident.
    


            In the video, a white van can be seen driving off the street and onto a grassy area as it appears to go around law enforcement vehicles. At least two black SUVs are seen in pursuit of the van.
    


            In the short video, the alleged ramming is not seen.
    


            In its release, the DHS said the driver was arrested and firearms were found inside the vehicle. The driver has prior arrests for “resisting law enforcement, public disturbance and intoxication/disruptive conduct,” the agency said.
    


Car crashes or ramming incidents have happened  over the past few months as many cities across the US have seen a crackdown on illegal immigration.
    


            There have been crashes between federal agents and suspects trying to flee, as well as alleged ramming incidents which involved pro-immigrant activists.
    


            As the Department of Homeland Security continues its immigration enforcement push in Charlotte, the mayor of Asheville said the small, artsy, tourist destination in Western North Carolina may be next.
    


            “We have learned that Asheville may be a targeted city,” Mayor Esther Manheimer said in a statement last week.
    


            “We value our strong relationships with all members of our community and remain dedicated to building trust while upholding the law,” the mayor continued. “We believe every person, regardless of immigration status, should feel safe in the community they call home.”
    


            Manheimer echoed the words of North Carolina Governor Josh Stein, who in a message to the people of the state said of North Carolinians, “We follow the law. We remain peaceful. We do not allow ourselves to be provoked. We stand with our neighbors. And when we see injustice, we bear witness.”
    


            Police in Asheville do not have authority to enforce immigration law, the mayor said.
    


CORRECTION: An earlier headline on this post incorrectly identified the agency behind the latest immigration operation in Charlotte. It is Customs and Border Protection.



            Students at one Charlotte high school are planning a walkout to protest the Department of Homeland Security's targeted immigration blitz in North Carolina's largest city.
    


            “The student's main objective is to provide protection and cover to their fellow students of immigrant descent,” a news release on the planned protest said.
    


            The students at East Mecklenburg High School also plan to wear all black today as part of the protest, according to the release.
    


            The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools system issued a statement Sunday night saying there has been no immigration enforcement activity on school property and it has not received any notice of planned ICE actions at its schools.
    


                    “CMS follows all federal and state laws protecting students' right to a public education. The U.S. Supreme Court guarantees that all children, regardless of immigration status, have the right to attend public school,” CMS Assistant Communications Officer Tom Miner said in a statement to school district families.
                





            The schools system reminded families it does not ask about immigration or citizenship status during enrollment, and immigration officials “cannot access staff, students, or private areas without a valid warrant or subpoena.”
    


            Students should attend class, Miner said, but added that per district policy,  students who miss assignments due to absence are allowed to make up the work regardless of why they missed school.
    


            A top leader in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina — where Charlotte is located — says local officials still haven't received any information from Customs and Border Protection on how it is conducting its new immigration enforcement operation.
    


                    “There's no coordination, collaboration or communication, and so it's stoking a lot of fear in our community,” Mark Jerrell, chairman of the Mecklenburg County Commission, told CNN's Audie Cornish this morning.
                





            Jerrell cited the case of Willy Wender Aceituno Medina, who is living in the US legally. His car window was smashed before he was briefly detained by federal agents. A CBP spokesperson later alleged in a statement that Aceituno had “refused to comply to lawful commands by officers.”
    


            “We had a resident who is here legally who had their window broken out,” said Jerrell. “Why were they stopped? What is this that allows folks just to be detained on the street, essentially profiled?”
    


            “There is a high level of profiling that appears to take place,” Jerrell added.
    


            Charlotte hadn't been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago and Los Angeles.
    


            It's a Democratic-led city, but it's hundreds of miles away from the northern and southern borders. And crime has dropped 8% from last year, with violent crimes down 20%, according to data released by the city in October.
    


            Democratic leaders in Charlotte have largely framed the operation — which came as a surprise to local officials — as a political distraction ahead of next year's midterm elections.
    


            “This administration ran on rhetoric that is anti-immigrant to score political points,” said City Council member Dimple Ajmera, a Democrat. “We have a very important US Senate race in 2026 coming up. And they want to score political points and use fear to divide our community.”
    


            Charlotte became a lightning rod for debates about policing and public safety in Democratic-led cities in September, after a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee was stabbed to death on public transit by a man with a lengthy history of arrests and mental health problems.
    


            Though the suspect arrested in that case is a US citizen, President Donald Trump seized on the killing as an example of what he framed as out-of-control crime, and he pledged to send the National Guard to blue cities across the country. Three Republican members of the state's congressional delegation, who represent districts around Charlotte, asked the governor earlier this month to deploy the Guard to fight crime.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court agreed Monday to review a policy used under past administrations to deny migrants a chance to apply for asylum on the Mexican border until space opened up to process claims.

The justices will hear the Trump administration's appeal of lower court rulings that struck down the practice known as metering, in which U.S. border agents capped the number of people seeking asylum at border crossings by prohibiting migrants from setting foot in the U.S.

The administration pressed for the high court's intervention even after President Donald Trump suspended the asylum system on the first day of his second term and advocates for migrants said the lower-court rulings have no ongoing practical effect.

The case will be argued in the late winter or early spring.

Metering was first used during President Barack Obama's administration when large numbers of Haitians appeared at the main crossing to San Diego from Tijuana, Mexico. It was expanded to all border crossings from Mexico during Trump's first term in the White House. 

The practice ended in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic led the government to restrict asylum-seekers even more severely. President Joe Biden formally rescinded the use of metering in 2021. 

Still, the Justice Department said it wanted the justices to hear the case because the court rulings took away “a tool that administrations of both parties have deemed critical for controlling the processing of inadmissible aliens during border surges.”




U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant ruled in 2021 that metering violated the migrants' constitutional rights and a federal law requiring officials to screen anyone who shows up seeking asylum.

A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Bashant's ruling in a 2-1 decision. Twelve of the 29 judges on the San Francisco-based appeals court voted to rehear the case, a strong signal that may have caught the justices' attention.

People seeking refuge in the U.S. are able to apply for asylum once they are on American soil, regardless of whether they came legally. To qualify, they have to show a fear of persecution in their own country because of specific reasons, such as their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. 

Once people are granted asylum, they can't be deported. They can work legally, bring immediate family, apply for legal residency and eventually seek U.S. citizenship. It offers a permanent future in the U.S.

A criminal illegal immigrant who was released into the U.S. under the Biden administration and began working as a commercial truck driver has been arrested over alleged ties to terrorism, federal authorities announced Monday.

Akhror Bozorov, 31, hails from Uzbekistan, where authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in 2022 for allegedly belonging to a terrorist organization, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said. Authorities in Uzbekistan accused him of distributing terrorist propaganda calling for jihad online and recruiting terrorists to join the jihad movement.  

ICE arrested Bozorov on Nov. 9 while he was working as a commercial truck driver, driving an 18-wheeler in Kansas.

ICE said that Bozorov was issued a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) in Pennsylvania while Gov. Josh Shapiro was in office. Officials added that he was granted authorization to work in January 2024 under the Biden administration.

""Not only was Akhror Bozorov — a wanted terrorist — RELEASED into the country by the Biden administration, but he was also given a commercial driver's license by Governor Shapiro's Pennsylvania,"" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""This should go without saying, but terrorist illegal aliens should not be operating 18-wheelers on America's highways. Biden and Mayorkas allowed countless terrorists to come into our country.""

She added: ""President Trump and Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target these national security threats."" 

ICE said Bozorov was issued a CDL from Pennsylvania. (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)

Bozorov's license indicated he was living in the Somerton section of far northeast Philadelphia, a suburban-feeling neighborhood at the edge of the city limits, which has recently seen an influx of Russian and Arabic residents.

In Pennsylvania, noncitizens with temporary or permanent resident status can currently qualify for PennDOT licenses. State lawmakers in Pennsylvania, where Republicans control the Senate and Democrats run the House, are battling over the issue in earnest.

Bozorov's recent arrest comes as the Trump administration is putting increased scrutiny on states that issue CDLs to immigrants after an illegal immigrant truck driver was accused of causing a tractor-trailer crash that killed three people in Fort Pierce, Florida.

Following the deadly crash, the Department of Transportation attempted to put restrictions on immigrants obtaining commercial driver's licenses, but a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday ruled that the move cannot be enforced.

Once an engine of radical social upheaval, the Chinese Communist Party is coaxing its citizens toward conservative lifestyles in line with its traditional culture.

China banned LGBT dating apps Blued and Finka this week, the latest targets of a yearslong effort to curb the promotion of homosexual culture in the country. Apple confirmed the removal of the apps from its platform, citing pressure from the CCP.

“We follow the laws of the countries where we operate. Based on an order from the Cyberspace Administration of China, we have removed these two apps from the China storefront only,” an Apple spokesperson announced.

The Cyberspace Administration is the national internet regulation body of the CCP, tasked with censoring and curating the Chinese net in accordance with government mandates.

Homosexuality in China exists in a limbo between social acceptability and taboo. It was legalized in 1997, but Beijing has sought to curb public exposure of LGBT organizations, art, and activism. Homosexual marriage is not recognized.

Jack Burnham, a research analyst in the Foundation for Defense of Democracies' China Program, said that this posture fits into the CCP's development of a “very culturally conservative worldview” that rejects influences deemed “not Chinese.”

“The CCP in the '90s to 2000s was a little more lenient around LGBTQ people,” Burnham told the Washington Examiner. “But once [Chinese President] Xi Jinping came into power, he really did have a more conservative attitude around these types of things, and he started to see kind of a snowball effect around the silencing of LGBTQ voices within China.”

Blued and Finka are not the first homosexual dating platforms to be censored by the CCP. Grindr was banned in 2022 ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics — just days after the Cyberspace Administration promised to “vigorously purify the online ecosystem.”

At the time, observers speculated that the Grindr ban had little to do with cultural values and was more focused on security, citing the app's lack of compliance with the nation's Personal Information Protection Law.

Without no obvious parallels in the case of Blued and Finka, it seems that social value concerns are indeed driving the CCP's censorship on LGBT platforms.

Similar campaigns have been widely documented in Russia, where the government has used its relationship with the Orthodox Church to promote socially conservative values and traditionalist sentiment among its population.

The CCP, an atheistic government, is perhaps less concerned with the moral question of homosexuality than with the social ramifications. Leaders see modern initiatives such as Pride parades, hook-up apps, and LGBT rights campaigns as a distinctly foreign development being imported into the country.

“It's not so much that it's rooted in religious aspects, though there may be religious undertones,” Burnham told the Washington Examiner. “It's more rooted in a very strong focus on preserving this traditional — even in some ways, almost ancient — type of society that was ordered around having obedience to a strong father figure [and] having a mother that took care of children.”

The Communist Revolution, rooted in the Western ideology of Marxism-Leninism imported from Europe, advocated a total rejection of native, Imperial-era customs and social structures. This was epitomized in its campaign against the “Four Olds” — old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas.

But in the decades since the People's Republic of China was established, the communist elites have quietly abandoned this rhetoric of breaking with the past and instead embraced a civic mythology championing “5,000 years of Chinese civilization” and a skepticism of foreign influences.

TV regulators previously ordered broadcasters to “resolutely put an end to sissy men and other abnormal esthetics” on public channels.

Whereas the first chairman of the PRC, Mao Zedong, used the phrase “women hold up half the sky” to urge female citizens into factories and farm labor, the modern Politburo suggests that women study Xi's political philosophy to “establish a correct outlook on marriage and love, childbirth and family.”

Xi's emphasis on childbearing is no doubt influenced by China's grim population projections, which led the CCP to abandon the disastrous one-child policy it introduced in 1979.

This reorientation toward the traditional can also be seen in the rehabilitation of Confucius, the seminal philosopher of Chinese history.

China's foreign study programs, dubbed “Confucius Institutes,” aim to capitalize on the philosopher's name recognition abroad while transmitting pro-China narratives drafted by communist academics.

Mao once deemed the ancient scholar and his teachings to be “feudal poison,” but Xi attends Confucius festivals as a guest of honor and advocates “using the past to serve the present.”

“The CCP project is very much melding these kind of socialist ideological tenets with what they view as the best aspects of a Chinese society and Chinese culture that has adapted over thousands and thousands of years,” Burnham explained. 

If foreign influence and social decline are at the root of China's opposition to Blued and Finka, a mirrored campaign against such ills is being fought against Beijing in the United States.

President Donald Trump approved a deal last month that would spin off the Chinese-owned app TikTok into a majority U.S.-owned entity.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the new American board of directors would maintain control over the app's algorithm, which has been accused of feeding users harmful, antisocial content.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report in 2024 that found the Chinese government was using the app to promote pro-Chinese views and exert influence over U.S. political discourse.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Jeffrey Gundlach thinks the next financial crisis is lurking in the booming world of private markets.

The CEO of $91 billion bond firm DoubleLine recently shared his take on an episode of Oddlots podcast. The $1.7 trillion private credit industry has been in focus lately amid high-profile blowups among big corporate borrowers, including First Brands and Tricolor Holdings, and as regional banks have come under scrutiny for problems with bad loans.

And Gundlach thinks things are likely to worsen from here.

He said that markets right now, from equities to fixed income, are overpriced, leading to a troubling outlook. The investor highlighted what he described as ""garbage lending"" in the private credit sector, a practice that puts the rapidly growing market on track for a financial crisis similar to the 2008 crash.

""The next big crisis in the financial markets is going to be private credit,"" Gundlach stated. ""It has the same trappings as subprime mortgage repackaging had back in 2006.""

To hedge the risk of a 2008-style blowup, Gundlach says investors should be holding a lot more cash, recommending a 20% allocation in portfolios.

Gundlach isn't the only market commentator to sound the alarm on private credit. The relative lack of transparency and regulation in non-bank lending has shown that risks can go unnoticed for long periods of time. As recent corporate collapses reveal, tightening market conditions can quickly create problems for corporate balance sheets.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon compared these troubled companies to ""cockroaches,"" implying that more problems are likely brewing beneath the surface of the private credit market due to poorly underwritten loans made to struggling companies. Data from Rosenberg Research shows that problems in both household and corporate balance sheets may be rising.

Gundlach highlighted the AAA ratings assigned to mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, which contributed to the subprime loan crisis of 2008. He raised the concern that private credit managers may not be able to realistically assess the value of loans on their books.

""There's only two prices for private credit — 100 or zero,"" Gundlach noted. ""It looks like it's safe because you could sell it any day, but it's not safe because the price at which you sell will be gapping lower day after day after day.""

In Gundlach's view, the health of the US equity market may be the worst it's been in his entire career, and he thinks investors are misreading the current financial landscape due to its perceived strength, just as they did in 2008.

""The market is incredibly speculative and speculative markets always go to insanely high levels. It happens every time,"" he said.

McKinsey & Company says AI is reshaping what it offers clients and how it charges them.

""We're doing more performance-based arrangements with our clients,"" Michael Birshan, managing partner of the UK, Ireland, and Israel at McKinsey, told reporters at a media event in London earlier in November.

Consultants have traditionally billed clients based on a project's scope and duration, with a portion of their fees tied to the number of billable hours worked by the team.

Now, rather than saying, ""Here's a scope, what's the fee for that?"" clients are coming to McKinsey and saying, ""Here's the outcome we'd like to get to,"" and the fee will be mostly contingent on the performance McKinsey can deliver, Birshan said. Some fixed cost components remain.

About a quarter of McKinsey's global fees come from this pricing model, he said.

Outcomes-based pricing didn't start because of AI, but the type of work AI transformation demands suits it, Kate Smaje, global leader of technology and AI at McKinsey, told Business Insider in an interview.

The shift in pricing developed over the past several years as McKinsey started doing more multi-year, multidisciplinary, transformation-based work for clients, though the proportion of 20% ""is probably more recent, the last few years,"" and they expect it to increase, she added.

Clients who were undertaking ""big career bets"" appreciated the company saying, 'Hey, look, your scorecard with your board is our scorecard, and we're both successful when this transformation works, so let's share in the upside,"" said Smaje.

Success is typically measured against a scorecard that includes factors such as investor targets, hitting revenue or profit goals within a set timeframe, operational measures, and customer satisfaction scores, she said.

AI is changing what clients want from consultants, and McKinsey is ""really rethinking the nature of the work that we do,"" Smaje told Business Insider.

People may still think of consultants as delivering straight strategy advice, but that now makes up less than 20% of the company's work, she said. Instead, clients are turning to them for ""deep implementation expertise"" and multi-year transformation projects that require support across the business from data to workforce policies.

""We're not a supplier, we're not a vendor, we're a genuine partner,"" Smaje said.

The changes unfolding at McKinsey reflect the broader shift across the consulting industry, as AI disrupts talent strategies, organizational structures, and business models at leading firms.

Raj Sharma, EY's global managing partner for growth and innovation, told Business Insider in January that the power of AI agents is forcing his firm to reconsider its commercial model.

Similar to McKinsey, instead of charging clients based on the hours and resources EY might spend on a project, Sharma said AI agents may call for a ""service-as-a-software"" approach where clients pay based on outcome.

""This is a moment where many of the fundamentals of the professional services model are coming under challenge,"" Smaje said in the media briefing. ""The fastest learners that are going to win in this space.""

India is ramping up its energy imports from the U.S. in a bid to reduce its trade surplus with Washington — a key demand of the Trump administration during trade negotiations with New Delhi.

On Monday, Hardeep Singh Puri, Indian union minister of petroleum and natural gas, announced a deal that will see the United States supply nearly 10% of New Delhi's liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) imports. 

Indian state-owned oil companies have signed a 1-year deal to import around 2.2 million tonnes per annum of LPG, from the U.S. Gulf Coast, he said in a post on X, calling it ""a historic first.""

This would be the ""first structured contract of U.S. LPG for the Indian market"" and the purchases would be based on ""Mount Belvieu as the benchmark for LPG purchases,"" he said.

""We believe that this move is for diversifying our LPG sourcing, which is currently concentrated in the Middle East, and also to reduce trade surplus with the U.S.,"" Nomura's equity analyst for energy Bineet Banka told CNBC in an emailed response.

India's total LPG imports are around 20-21 million tons annually, he said adding that if 10% of that supply is sourced the U.S., at current prices, it implies an incremental import of $1 billion from the U.S. Though Banka said that the incremental imports are ""not much"" compared with the India's trade surplus of $40 billion with the U.S.

Since August, ties between the U.S. and India have been strained after Washington imposed a tariff of 50% on Indian goods. Reciprocal tariffs of 25% were imposed on Indian goods as part of a broad strategy to address trade imbalances and boost domestic industries, while the other 25% was due to India's import of Russian oil.

In September, President Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of India, referring to trade ties with the country as ""a totally one-sided disaster!""

During that same month, Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, who was in the U.S. for trade negotiations, had reportedly said that India will increase its trade with the U.S. on energy products in the years to come.

""And being close friends, natural partners, our energy security goals will have a very high element of US involvement,"" the Indian minister had said.

Since then, the two sides have softened their stances, with Trump recently evoking memories of his last visit to India and referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as ""his friend"" and a ""great man,"" as he addressed reporters at the White House on Nov 6.

The U.S. President also said that India has ""largely stopped buying Russian oil,"" a fact which is yet to be backed by data.

According to data shared by tanker tracker, Kpler, as of Nov. 17, India's imports of Russian crude oil remain at a relatively high level, at 1.85 million barrels per day compared to 1.6 mbd in October.

""Given that buyers are granted until Nov 21 to wind down transactions with Rosneft and Lukoil, Indian refiners are expected to rush to bring in as many barrels as possible in the next few days,"" said Kpler's Muyu Xu.

But she added that India's imports of U.S. crude ""saw a sharp rise in October, reaching 568 kbd (thousand barrel per day)—the highest level since February 2021.""

India imports around 5 million barrels per day of crude oil, according to data from Nomura which predicts that the total impact on the import bill will be around $1.1 billion, assuming that 35% of the Russian mix this year comes down to 15% and taking into account an average Russian crude discount of $3 per barrel.

Experts are divided as to how this change of energy mix will affect India's economy.

According to Nomura's Asia Economics team, ""India could also stand to gain if this shift [away from Russian crude imports] leads to a trade deal with the US and the lowering of tariffs."" The firm assumes that the 25% Russian penalty ""will be removed after November, while the 25% reciprocal tariff stays through FY26.""

But Rystad Energy's Pankaj Srivastava cautions that India's import bill is expected to increase.

""With thawing of US-India relations, reduction of tariffs, planned expansion of refineries in 2026/2027 along with petrochemical plants, import bill is expected to increase unless India substantially increase the domestic production,"" Srivastava, senior vice president of commodity markets at Rystad told CNBC.

A British man that hacked the social media profiles of former president Barack Obama, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and other celebrities and brands to scam people out of their Bitcoin has been ordered to pay it back—over $5 million worth of BTC and other coins at the current price.

Joseph James O'Connor was charged for his role in a 2000 SIM-swapping scheme that led to the takeover of social media profiles for dozens of major accounts, and the subsequent theft of cryptocurrency valued at $794,000 at the time. 

“Joseph James O'Connor targeted well-known individuals and used their accounts to scam people out of their crypto assets and money,” said Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Proceeds of Crime Division Adrian Foster, in a statement.

“We were able to use the full force of the powers available to us to ensure that even when someone is not convicted in the UK, we are still able to ensure they do not benefit from their criminality,” he added.

O'Connor pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced to five years in prison by a judge in the Southern District of New York. He was ordered to pay $794,012.64 in forfeiture at that time, and is now responsible for the civil recovery order from the U.K.'s Crown Prosecution Service. The £4.1 million in Bitcoin is worth about $5.4 million.

According to the CPS, its civil recovery order pertains to around 235 Ethereum, 42 BTC, and  143,000 BUSD, Binance's now-depreciated dollar-backed stablecoin.

Scammers have frequently utilized hacked social media profiles to trick unsuspecting users into parting with their crypto. O'Connor's scams prompted victims to send a small amount of Bitcoin to an address with a promise of more in return, while more popular scams of late have centered around meme coins. 

For example, earlier this year, hackers promoted a fake UFC meme coin on the Solana blockchain after an Instagram account takeover, making away with $1.4 million in proceeds. 

Similarly, a malicious takeover of the McDonald's Instagram account resulted in $700,000 for hackers on a fake Grimace token last year, and numerous celebrities and other brands have had their accounts hijacked to perpetrate pump-and-dump meme coin scams.

A mid-year report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis indicated that more than $2.1 billion has been stolen from crypto users via crimes thus far in 2025, a growing share of which is contributed to personal wallet compromises.

Cboe Global Markets unveiled “continuous futures” for Bitcoin and Ethereum, describing them as familiar tools for crypto-native traders in a Monday press release.

The Chicago-based firm, which operates the largest options exchange in the U.S, said the derivatives will resemble perpetual-style futures through a 10-year lifecycle and daily cash adjustment, when they begin trading next month.

In a statement, Cboe Global Head of Derivatives Rob Hocking said the offering is aimed at tapping into a part of the market over which U.S. regulators have little oversight.

""As perpetual futures have historically been traded offshore, Cboe is excited to help expand access to these products within a U.S.-regulated, transparent, and intermediary-friendly environment,” he said, while pointing to “growing customer demand.”

For years, traders have tapped centralized crypto exchanges like Binance and Bybit to trade derivatives that don't have an expiration date. However, Hyperliquid and Aster are among decentralized alternatives that gained traction earlier this year.

CME Group, a leading futures exchange, introduced “spot quoted futures” in April. Those derivatives also offer exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum, and they can be held for up to five years without requiring traders to roll their positions.

Traditionally, futures contracts carry a specific expiry date, either on a monthly or quarterly basis, after which they must be settled. If traders want to maintain their exposure, they have to close an expiring contract and open a new one with a later expiration date.

Perpetual futures allow a trader to speculate on an asset indefinitely, and their prices are anchored to their underlying asset through periodic payments, or a so-called funding rate.

On Monday, the value of all outstanding Bitcoin futures contracts totaled $65.8 billion, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. CME was responsible for $13 billion worth of futures contracts, followed by Binance at $12.5 billion. Hyperliquid stood at $3 billion.

Cboe's latest derivatives tap crypto analytics firm Kaiko for underlying price data. In a statement, Anne-Claire Maurice, Kaiko's managing director of derived data, said the products are set to address “a real need for institutional investors.”

""These continuous futures eliminate the operational friction of rolling positions while maintaining the transparency and oversight that regulated markets provide,” she said.

How to Send a Message to Future Civilizations

When written knowledge is more ephemeral than ever, how can we pass on what's important?

After my grandmother died, we had to clean out her condominium. Wall to wall and floor to ceiling, her studio apartment in a Berkeley, Calif., high-rise was filled with books. Every surface was stacked with them except for a couple of chairs, the tiny kitchen counter, the bed and narrow connecting paths like game trails in a forest. The shelves were three books deep and bowed in their middle.

But this wasn't chaos. Besides being a communist, a labor activist and a speaker of five languages that I knew of (Yiddish, English, German, some Russian and some Spanish, in addition to her ability to read Latin), Grandma had been a lecturer in library science at the University of California, Berkeley. Every shelf and every pile was a subject, placed in proximity to related subjects and alphabetized by author.

When my wife and I started excavating, we found another organizational layer. Some of the books had whole magazines stuffed into them—the New Yorker, the London Review of Books, Smithsonian—folded open to an article that was relevant to their enveloping tome. Further into the stacks, a whole other classification system surfaced—articles neatly torn or clipped out, with notes stapled to them on which Grandma's looping cursive noted their subject and bibliographic metadata.

This was more than a library. Sure, it contained books—objects that convey information—but the condo itself was an object that conveyed information. It was what historian of memory Mary Carruthers calls an architectural mnemonic—a map of Grandma's multivariate, interesting and generally unshakable opinions. Its physical structure at every scale helped her to maintain not just her sources but her ideas and to send them forward in time to when she might need them. “The archive has always been a pledge,” according to a translation of philosopher Jacques Derrida's book Archive Fever, “and like every pledge, a token of the future.”

Not every pledge gets fulfilled, of course. By the end of her life, my grandmother's once-pointed mind had become less deft; she couldn't really understand her own archive anymore. Information theory says that for a message to arrive, both sender and receiver have to agree on its form and timing. And now the receiver was gone. This happens all the time—at the scale of studio apartments and entire societies, on time spans of years or millennia. Even organizations dedicated to creating things and trying to remember them don't always know how to ensure that those things make it through time. That's understandable. Nobody really knows how to speak to the future in a way that it will hear.

When we try to unravel information from the past, we're limited by what archives and nature have preserved. “The technical structure of the archiving archive determines the structure of the archivable content,” as Derrida put it. Take the oldest known piece of human art, a 73,000-year-old drawing of crosshatched red triangles on a chunk of rock. South African archaeologists found it in a cave called Blombos, about 185 miles east of Cape Town. Whether these triangles were a vision of mountains, an econometric chart of the seal harvest or an accident of boredom is lost to time. Maybe humans were constantly going around drawing ochre triangles on fragments of rock, and symbolic thinking was common. Maybe only Paleolithic geniuses did it. Whoever drew that fragment was thinking about something, but no one here in the future can know what.

Even when humans create written language and records, they often fail to send information up the line. Most of what historians know about ancient Greece and Rome is because of a lucky accident—scholars in the Abbasid Caliphate, which extended throughout much of the Middle East, got scrolls from Alexandrian libraries and translated them. But which scrolls never made it? Archaeologists know that a Babylonian copper merchant named Ea-nasir had supply chain problems nearly 4,000 years ago but only because of the fluke survival of clay tablets saying that happened. The shape of the archive of the past limits the knowledge of the future.

Nobody really knows how to speak to the future in a way that it will hear.

The northeastern coast of Japan is dotted with future-message failures—hundreds of “tsunami stones” mark past catastrophes dating back 600 years. One in the village of Aneyoshi denotes the level of a flood in the 1800s and warns people not to build houses any lower along the hillside; others advise people to flee to Nokoriya, the “Valley of Survivors,” or Namiwake, “Waves' Edge,” the extent of a tsunami in 1611. People mostly ignore them. The Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011 hit that very same coast, swept away a bunch of stones and killed more than 18,000 people.

Another example: In 1850, on the main canal leading from the Merrimack River to the industrial mill town of Lowell, Mass., James Francis built a dam. As the engineer in charge of Lowell's water-powered textile mills, Francis was convinced that the Merrimack was liable to flood. So he built a 27-foot-wide, 25-foot-tall, 17-inch-thick palisade out of experimental pressure-treated pine. The cost of a project like this “Great Gate” in 2025 would be about $413 million. The gate was so heavy that it had no mechanism to raise or lower it—it just hung over the Pawtucket Canal, suspended by a massive iron chain. Locals called it “Francis's Folly.”

Two years later a massive rainstorm flooded the Merrimack. At 3:30 in the morning on April 22, 1852, a worker used a chisel to cut the chain. The gate dropped; the town was saved; Boston newspapers hailed Francis as a hero.

In 1936 there was another storm and an even bigger flood. Lowell was doomed! But someone remembered that really big gate. Workers once again rushed to the gatehouse. No one had a key, so they broke in. Someone shined a light into the decaying shack, which was empty except for a spike stuck through the floor. On the wall hung a sledgehammer. Above it, a sign read, “Take the hammer. Hit the pin.” The men followed the instructions. The spike broke the chain; the gate fell; the town was saved. Francis's message to the future had been received.

But mine hasn't. The thing is, I don't know if all of this really happened. The 1936 flood is real, and the Great Gate really did save Lowell twice. The “take the hammer” part, though? I heard it on a tour there 25 years ago and bottled up, hoping to save it for a story someday. And I can't find that anecdote in any of my research about Lowell or Francis. I sent a message to myself in the future, yet in the present, I cannot know if it is true.

In 1996 in San Francisco, two groups of nerds steeped in techno-optimism founded organizations aimed at communicating with the future.

One was the Internet Archive. Even then, historians were envisioning a digital catastrophe: “Electronic records are far more numerous already but at much greater risk of loss” than physical records, wrote librarian David Zeidberg in a 1999 paper. The material of the digital archive—hard drives, optical drives, floppy disks—degrades even more quickly than materials such as film or paper. Old bound editions of journals in basement libraries were all but immutable, but digital documents mutate with a single keystroke. So computer engineer and Internet search expert Brewster Kahle took on the mission of preserving digital information. Computer memory was cheap; Kahle set out to simply save everything. The Internet Archive captures a record of the ever changing World Wide Web at various dates, yet it's stored electronically, in the same fallible medium as the thing it's trying to preserve.

The other organization was the Long Now Foundation. Its founders took a view that was simultaneously more and less expansive than that of the Internet Archive. They didn't want to preserve everything, but they did want to preserve some things permanently. Long Nowers such as Stewart Brand, one of the co-founders, looked at what kinds of materials survived the vicissitudes of history and determined to build archives that were expressly aimed at being useful to whoever would be still around in a few thousand years.

The giant, 10,000-year clock that Long Now is building inside a mountain has gotten a lot of attention. That's deep commitment to the bit. But more interesting is a Rosetta stone–like project that aims to save a bunch of human languages in a permanent, easily readable format. “You can either write things in plaintext on giant stone tablets that last for thousands of years, and as long as someone can decode the language, they can read them,” says Zander Rose, former executive director of Long Now, “or you can go with a method that assumes you rewrite the data onto a new medium, whatever that new medium is, every day or every year or every 10 years.”

The shape of the archive of the past limits the knowledge of the future.

The Internet archivists sometimes sound fringe, but they have a point. Things have gotten every bit as bad as they warned. A 2024 Pew Research report found that more than a third of all webpages that existed just a decade previous were inaccessible. And one in five government webpages had at least one broken link. In a 2021 report Harvard University researchers found that a quarter of the two million hyperlinks in the digital version of the New York Times were broken. And when digital-only journalism outlets take their archives offline, you can't just go to a downtown library and check those articles out on microfiche. They're gone. Meanwhile millions of articles and more than 170 open-access journals are absent from major archives, and the U.S. federal government is abandoning critical databases and data-gathering capacity. If culture is defined by what it saves, then 21st-century culture is sick with link rot.

And digital media themselves degrade. Magnetic media in computers and phones last about a decade; optical discs can make it for a century unless they're afflicted with ""laser rot.""

But saving everything isn't actually sending a clear message to the future, is it? Archivists used to say, “Quod non est in actis, non est in mundo”—a Latin phrase that roughly translates to “That which is not in the files does not exist in the world.” But that's not true. What's not there is critical, too. The Internet Archive is profoundly useful—I used it for this article. But “‘let's just keep it all' is always wrong,” says Geoffrey Bowker, a researcher at the University of California, Irvine, who studies archives and information history. If you “keep too much of the same stuff, you've got too much of the same stuff.” The question for the good archivist is: Which material should be saved, and which should not? “Unfortunately, the Internet Archive has never asked that question,” Bowker says. “Most archivists don't.”

For his part, Kahle says he's answering a different question entirely. Back in the mid-1990s, he wrote in this very magazine that his archive could afford to save everything, and so it would. “The Web, since the early days, grew up with a system to preserve its history, as Wikipedia or GitHub do, or just as all libraries keep out-of-print editions of published materials,” Kahle says. “The Web collections now, total, one trillion webpages, which is a testament to the sharing impulse of maybe a billion people.”

The Long Now team took a different approach, determining that it would first save languages—the key to accessing everything else someday. But what medium should be used? “Things like stone, ceramics and glass are generally the most stable over time, but they also have the problem of being brittle,” Rose says. “So you get into metals.” Other materials might also work—laser-etched ultrapure silica glass or silver halide images on polyester ribbons, for example. Long Now decided to etch documents into silicon with machines for prototyping computer circuits and to then cast the result in a high-nickel alloy.

Long Now's other rule was that the archive had to be readable with an unaided human eye. “Napoleon's soldiers found the Rosetta stone, looked at it, and said, ‘Okay, this is important,'” Rose says. “If you found a CD 1,000 years from now, it might get used as a necklace.”

Information from Long Now's Rosetta project—including examples of 7,000 human languages—is part of a library, etched onto nickel, that a rocket carried to the moon in 2024. The library also archived all of Wikipedia, books from the digitization group Project Gutenberg, a curated selection of the arts from the Arch Mission Foundation (which led the library project) and a book revealing the secrets of illusionist David Copperfield. On the weather-free surface of the moon, it'll be there, effectively, forever.

If culture is defined by what it saves, then 21st-century culture is sick with link rot.

Some scientists have proposed that we save data with nature's preferred medium for information storage and transfer: DNA. It's easy enough to translate digital 1's and 0's into DNA's four-base genetic code. In the mid 2010s, researchers theorized that two grams of single-stranded DNA could store nearly a zettabyte, or a million terabytes, of data for thousands of years. Obviously that hasn't quite come to pass yet. DNA turns out to need an awful lot of error correction, and reliable writing and reading has proven difficult.

Then again, the ultimate DNA archive already exists. It's us—and every living thing on Earth. Our genetic material already reflects every challenge Earthlings ever faced. The information is inscribed in noncoding DNA, which scientists used to describe as “junk.” It'll last as long as we do. The message is complete, the medium is rock-solid, and the sender is nature itself. It's just that nobody knows exactly how to read it yet.

This may be the biggest problem for future-facing archives: metadata. Any message from the past to the future has to be able to tell its recipients how to read it. A sign in a canal gatehouse is easy mode. What about, say, warning people away from nuclear waste dumps 10,000 years from now? In the early 1990s, a team at Sandia National Laboratories proposed marking such sites with fearsome cartoon faces and a plaque with scary words such as “this place is not a place of honor ... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here ... nothing valued is here. What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us.” Today that proposal is just a meme.

The Long Nowers expected as much. “On anything you're burying for a long time, the worst thing you can do is put a seal on it that says, ‘Please don't open this; it's really dangerous,'” Rose says. “Nothing made thieves more sure there was gold on the other side of that door.”

Lately, Rose has been studying the longest-lasting companies on Earth, those with centuries-long continuity. He says that the most successful ones always have a storyteller, a guardian of the company's history and culture who can pass that legacy along. It might be impossible to send stand-alone epistemic objects to the future, but you can send ideas. Before there was writing, there was the word. It turns out that a message to the future really needs a messenger.

That brings me back to my grandmother's library. The ideas it contained only made sense when they were attached to one another—and to her. There's a reason that “text” and “context” share an etymological root with “textile”; a concept only has meaning when it's woven into a wider fabric.

After a few days of standing in front of her books, I realized that the last message my grandmother sent wasn't to herself but to me. I saw in her librarianship the obsessive, idiosyncratic way I organize my own archives and try to talk to my own future. I'd learned it from her library. “Oh,” I said to my wife, “this is why I do that.”

She looked up from wiping a rag across a now empty shelf and said, “Duh.”

Like so many messages to the future, this one had gone awry—and had also found a recipient. It was nice to hear from Grandma. I selected some books for myself and started thinking about where to shelve them.

The Unlikely Story of an E-mail Time Machine

Twenty years ago Forbes.com sent hundreds of thousands of messages to the future. Here's what happened next

By David M. Ewalt 

Federico Tramonte

This article is part of a package in collaboration with Forbes on time capsules, preserving information and communicating with the future. Read more from the report.

The world was different in 2005: flip phones were state of the art, Netflix only sent movies by mail, and kale was a garnish, not a main course. I was working for Forbes's website, Forbes.com.  In those days, news websites were treated like awkward teenagers living in a basement apartment, kept at a distance from their respectable parents.

The digital media business was fresh and chaotic, and new journalists like me reveled in the weirdness of the Internet and the opportunities it gave us to experiment. In contrast, magazine sales teams seemed stuck in the Mad Men era, pitching tired concepts over martinis and treating online news like something you threw into a deal for free, like a branded pen.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Given this context, you can imagine my lack of enthusiasm when our sales department revealed that they had sold a big advertising sponsorship to an IT infrastructure company and asked me, the telecom reporter, if I could put together a special report on the concept of “Communicating.” Fortunately, my editor at the time, Michael Noer, was equally nonplussed at the idea of a dozen stories about routers and network switches.



So we decided to approach the idea of “Communicating” from every single angle other than networking hardware. We commissioned Arthur C. Clarke to write a keynote essay about how technology was actually making it harder for people to communicate with each other. I wrote about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and asked experts how they would craft their own messages to an alien species. And I interviewed two dozen luminaries I'd always wanted to meet about anything I could think of: Noam Chomsky on the spontaneous invention of language; Jane Goodall on how language makes it harder for primates to communicate; Stan Lee on why words are better with pictures.

And because this was 2005, the sales team had promised its client some kind of nebulous “interactive” component of the package, so Michael I and decided to tackle the idea of “communicating across time” by playing with the concept of a time capsule.

This was our thinking: Time capsules are boring. The reason why they are so often created by small-town governments and elementary schools is that they are simple and inoffensive; they offer banal tokens to the future. Your typical time capsule contains items that are either redundant (“Oh, great, a newspaper from 50 years ago, just like I could find in the library or on the Internet”) or meaningless (“I'm sure this toy meant something to the kid who put it in here, but now it's just trash”).

So we decided to bring the concept into the 21st century: an e-mail time capsule. We built a tool for our website that allowed users to write themselves a message and choose whether they wanted to receive it in one, three, five, 10 or 20 years. Then we threw it open to the public.

It was a hit. Hundreds of thousands of messages queued up—which meant we had to figure out how to actually store and send all those e-mails, and that's harder than you might think.

Here's the issue: digital impermanence. Hard drives fail. Formats become obsolete. Remember floppy disks and zip drives? Today they might as well be cuneiform on clay tablets. How could we be sure we had a good way not only to preserve our e-mails but also to make sure they were sent on schedule?

Our solution was, if you ask me, both clever and elegant. We'd build a program that could run on three computers that were owned by three different companies and lived in different places on the Internet. Each would have a copy of the e-mails, and every couple of months, each of them would ping the others and say, “Hey, I'm here.” The recipients would respond, “Yes, I'm here, too.” When the first year was up, instance A would send out all the scheduled e-mails. But if instance B and C didn't hear from that machine, instance B would send the e-mails, and so on.

With this kind of redundancy built into the sending process, the next issue was figuring out where to place the programs. Forbes was 90 years old, but in 2005 the conventional wisdom was that print media was already dead; it just hadn't noticed yet. (As the current editor in chief of one of those zombie publications, I would like to note here that Scientific American just celebrated its 180th anniversary, and Forbes turned 108).

So we decided to hedge our bets by storing the data at three very different institutions: first, at Forbes, the longtime lion of capitalism; second, at the Internet giant Yahoo, which had then become a $55-billion company after several years of fast growth; and finally, at Codefix Consulting, a one-man consultancy run by a friend of mine from college, Garrison Hoffman.

We were hedging our bets: Legacy media, blazing-hot dot-com, plucky small business—we figured that between the three of those, we'd have all contingencies covered. These systems might live forever. What could go wrong?

Everything. Yahoo had layoffs within the first few months, and our clever little solution never sent a ping. Forbes was sold to an investment group that included the rock star Bono, and our plucky online newsroom got absorbed by the print team. Garrison sent the first year's e-mails himself, then the third, then the fifth.

By the time the 10th anniversary rolled around, I hadn't worked for Forbes for nearly two years. I was a freelance journalist, working on a book, and the e-mail time capsule was the furthest thing from my mind. But the project survived because somebody cared: a few months before the time capsule was supposed to “reopen,” Garrison reached out to me. We put our heads together. Codefix Consulting sent out all the e-mails again.

Our best-laid plans had gone awry, but this new order seemed to work just as well. Garrison and I put reminders in our now totally digital calendars, scheduled to alert us when another decade passed. The project seemed secure.

Just under two years later, Garrison Hoffman died, unexpectedly, at the age of 46.

Another eight years passed. I still miss my friend. But when my calendar notification popped up a few months ago, I remembered why I liked him so much. Searching my e-mail inbox in a mild panic, trying to figure out what to do, I found a message:

“Codefix::Time capsule is a mod_ perl application designed to collect user messages, submitted via HTTP POST to a MySQL database, to be returned to the user via email at select future dates,” it read. “Messages are retrieved from the database and submitted to the local mail transport agent (MTA) by timecapsule.cron. This script should work with any sendmail compatible mail utility, and may also be configured as a backup server.”

Garrison knew and followed the best practices of his trade. He'd documented his work, annotated his code and archived the files on a server where I could find them, just in case.

I called Michael Noer, my old editor at Forbes, who, by now, was also an old friend. We made plans for the anniversary. And as you read this, nearly 18,000 people have received an e-mail from a different kind of old friend—their own past self.

The big takeaway for me is that technology didn't save this project; human relationships did. We survived the first year and the 20th year because friends stayed in touch. Nothing else went as expected: Yahoo, the billion-dollar giant, vanished from the equation. Forbes, the old media dinosaur, endured.

A one-man shop, and one man's dedication to his trade, proved the most reliable of all.

Ironically, the original Forbes.com special report on Communicating is now a wreck—images gone, links broken. Digital rot wins there. But the e-mails survived, and opening one is profound. Whether the people who sent them saw their 2005 dreams come true or not, they've had a rare chance to compare past hopes to present reality.

My own e-mail to the future is actually kind of prosaic. The subject line: “Hot damn, it worked.”

“Somehow, some way, you got this thing to work properly,” the message continues. “Go track down Michael Noer, who owes you a magnum of expensive champagne for pulling this off.”

That's why this time machine worked: not because of servers but because of humans, because of people who cared about each other and about something they had worked together to build.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Your Brain Is Naturally Telepathic, Research Suggests—Meaning Our Minds Are All Connected","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69442711/brains-sync-during-communication/","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 17:13:00 GMT","

Communication is really “a single act performed by two brains,” a neuroscientist claims.

Jinx, you owe me a soda!

These moments often feel uncanny, like something more than a mere conversational coincidence. The “click” you experience with people isn't just your imagination, research suggests. In fact, it may come from a natural telepathy, which silently shapes our daily communication—and may even help us shape the future. 

The phenomenon is called neural coupling, which is when two or more people's brains “synchronize,” or simultaneously display the same activity patterns. Still, neural coupling isn't quite as powerful as the telepathy seen in movies—synchronizing with a friend doesn't mean you'll be able to transmit words directly into their mind. Uri Hasson, PhD, one of the first researchers to discover brain-to-brain coupling more than a decade ago, describes our brains as a sort of wireless transmitter. That may seem like science fiction at first, but Hasson says there's nothing mystical about the process. 

“It's not a Jedi mind trick,” he writes in a statement. “This is what communication is. It is what humans do best, and it's unique and amazing.”

Hasson argues that his research shows communication is really “a single act performed by two brains.” He believes that all brains naturally couple with the outside world, reacting to whatever stimuli we're bombarded with. What makes humans different is our ability to couple without stimuli, according to Hasson. For example, if you show two monkeys a banana, their brains would likely react the same way, and the same goes for humans. However, if someone says the word banana to you, both you and the speaker would understand that you're referring to the oblong, yellow fruit despite it not being physically present. This is something not all animals can achieve, which is why it's so exciting for researchers like Hasson. 

Studies show that brain synchronization happens in many settings. For instance, researchers found neural coupling can occur during chess matches or collaborative music-making sessions—two activities that require focus and creativity. On the other hand, a 2014 study published in PLUS One found that synchronization can occur during a much more physical activity: kissing. The experiment found heightened inter-brain connection when heterosexual couples were kissing each other's lips rather than the backs of their hands.  

But you don't necessarily need to pucker up or become a Grandmaster to optimize brain synchronization—some research suggests coupling could defy physical presence, too. For example, a 2022 study demonstrated that pairs working together on a video game showed increased synchronization, despite their only interaction being through on-screen movements. However, other unrelated experts who study neural coupling believe connectivity may be stronger face-to-face, as nonverbal actions like hand gestures aid in our communication, according to Hasson.

Perhaps most surprisingly, synchronization isn't dependent on age or even intellect.  One 2019 study published in the peer-reviewed journal Psychological Science found that infant and adult brains sync during play. The study analyzed the brain activity of adults as well as children from nine to 15 months in age During the experiment, an adult researcher interacted with each baby by playing with toys, singing nursery rhymes, and reading a book. In a second stage, the experimenter read a story to another adult while the children sat off to the side with their parents. 

The research team found that during face-to-face interactions, the babies' brains were coupled with the adults, particularly in areas involved with high-level understanding of the world. On the contrary, the synchronization disappeared when the children were disengaged from the adult researcher. According to the team, this may be subconsciously shaping our communication. 

“We were also surprised to find that the infant brain was often ‘leading' the adult brain by a few seconds, suggesting that babies do not just passively receive input but may guide adults toward the next thing they're going to focus on: which toy to pick up, which words to say,” Casey Lew-Williams, PhD, co-author study, says in a press release. 

Not only is neural coupling happening all the time, but it can even help us without us realizing it, researchers say. In the 2023 study, Suzanne Dikker, PhD, and her colleagues studied how brain-to-brain synchrony benefits students in a classroom. The team found that students whose brainwaves were more in sync with their teacher and peers actually learned better, retaining more of the information they were taught.  

Dikker uses the analogy of walking next to someone extremely tall—you may have to take longer steps, or they may take shorter steps, but you're ultimately meeting at a pace somewhere in the middle. This kind of negotiation is predictive of learning, she explains in an interview. For example, if your brain can predict what the teacher is going to say next, you are ultimately learning better. 

This is because we are “rhythmic creatures,” always looking for something to sync to, according to Dikker. She explains that conversations naturally have a rhythmic flow, so through this social coordination we can unlock “smooth interactions,” ultimately deepening our understanding of one another.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Daily music listening linked to big drop in dementia risk","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251116105633.htm","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 14:33:05 GMT","

Listening to music after the age of 70 appears to be associated with a meaningful reduction in dementia risk. A research team from Monash University analyzed data from more than 10,800 older adults and found that people in this age group who regularly listened to music experienced a 39 percent lower likelihood of developing dementia.

The project, led by Monash honours student Emma Jaffa and Professor Joanne Ryan, examined how both listening to music and playing instruments relate to cognitive health in adults over 70. Their analysis showed that individuals who consistently listened to music, compared with those who never, rarely, or only sometimes did so, had a 39 percent reduced risk of dementia. Playing an instrument was also tied to benefits, with a 35 percent reduction in dementia risk.

Findings Drawn From Large-Scale Aging Studies

Researchers based their work on information from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study and the ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Older Persons (ALSOP) sub‐study. The results were published in the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry.

People who reported always listening to music demonstrated the strongest cognitive advantages. This group showed a 39 percent lower incidence of dementia and a 17 percent lower incidence of cognitive impairment, along with higher overall cognitive scores and better episodic memory (used when recalling everyday events). Those who both listened to and played music on a regular basis had a 33 percent reduced risk of dementia and a 22 percent reduced risk of cognitive impairment.

Music as an Accessible Activity for Brain Health

Ms Jaffa noted that the outcomes of the research ""suggests music activities may be an accessible strategy for maintaining cognitive health in older adults, though causation cannot be established,"" she said.

The findings come at a time when population aging is creating new public health challenges. Longer life expectancy has led to rising rates of age‐related conditions, including cognitive decline and dementia, which places increasing pressure on families and healthcare systems.

Lifestyle Choices May Shape Cognitive Aging

Senior author Professor Ryan emphasized the urgency of exploring options to help delay or prevent dementia. ""With no cure currently available for dementia, the importance of identifying strategies to help prevent or delay onset of the disease is critical,"" she said.

She added that ""Evidence suggests that brain aging is not just based on age and genetics but can be influenced by one's own environmental and lifestyle choices. Our study suggests that lifestyle-based interventions, such as listening and/or playing music can promote cognitive health.""

Bipolar membranes operated under reverse-bias (r-BPM) provide the only potential route to use anodes free of platinum group metals in CO2 electrolyzers when paired with the oxygen evolution reaction. Under 100% water dissociation efficiency (WDE) conditions, the OH− generated by a r-BPM fully replenishes the OH− consumed by the oxygen evolution reaction, maintaining an alkaline anolyte. However, unwanted co-ion crossover leads to <100% WDEs, gradually causing anolyte acidification and nickel-based anodes to corrode over time. Here we experimentally measured the WDE of r-BPMs in a membrane–electrode assembly configuration as a function of the current density, anolyte concentration and cation identity, finding that the highest measured WDE of 98% is insufficient to maintain an alkaline environment over extended operation. We further highlight through modeling that WDEs >99.8% are required to operate for >10,000 h with reasonable anolyte volumes. Our results show that r-BPMs CO2 electrolyzers require additional strategies, such as reverting to platinum group metal anodes or regenerating the anolyte, to operate stably at an industrial scale.

Low-temperature CO2 electrolysis offers a pathway to replace fossil fuels as raw materials to produce carbon-based products. During the past several years, CO2 electrolysis has experienced many advancements that have helped bridge the gap toward its commercialization1,2,3,4. One of the biggest challenges intrinsic to CO2 electrolyzers is the formation of carbonate species from CO2 molecules reacting with the locally generated OH−. When utilizing anion exchange membranes (AEMs), carbonate negatively impacts the electrolyzer performance through both salt formation5,6 and carbonate crossover7,8,9. Crossover results in carbonate accumulation in the anolyte, which drives pH toward neutral conditions. Even when starting with a 1 M KOH solution (pH 14), acidification of the anolyte occurs in just a few hours10.

When the anodic reaction is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), acidification then requires the use of platinum group metals (PGMs) such as iridium because nickel-based anodes (for example, NiFeOx) will corrode11,12. Iridium's scarcity (annual supply of ~7 tons (refs. 13,14)), cost and environmental impact, however, raise concerns about its feasibility for industrial-scale usage. Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers face a similar iridium dependency, necessitating alternative strategies such as different cell configurations, decreasing catalyst loading, improving the recycling rate of Ir anodes and designing PGM-free catalysts for the acidic anodic OER15,16,17.

In a membrane electrode assembly (MEA)-based CO2 electrolyzer18, the membrane type plays a key role in defining the ion transport inside the cell and subsequently the local electrode environment19,20,21. Here, AEMs currently show the best MEA CO2 electrolyzer performance metrics, but as noted, carbonate crossover necessitates iridium for the OER22. A cation exchange membrane (CEM) paired with acidic anolyte conditions can inhibit carbon crossover, but owing to the acidic environment, iridium would still be required23. Of the four viable membrane configurations shown in Fig. 1a, only a bipolar membrane (BPM) operating in the reversed-bias mode works to maintain an alkaline anolyte environment and thus provides the only potential route for CO2 electrolyzers to utilize PGM-free anodes24.

a, The membrane selection defines the anode material. An AEM, CEM or f-BPM will require Ir-based OER catalysts, whereas an r-BPM could use Ni-based anodes. b, The reverse-bias BPM under ideal conditions (WDE of 100%) with no co-ion leakage, leading to a constant anolyte pH over time. c, The reverse-bias BPM in nonideal conditions (WDE <100%), with carbon and cation crossover causing an anolyte pH decrease that leads to corrosion of the Ni anode.

A BPM, which consists of an anion exchange layer (AEL) and a cation exchange layer (CEL), can operate in two different modes: forward bias (f-BPM) and reverse bias (r-BPM)25,26. Under forward bias, carbonate species from the cathode migrate across an AEL, where they are met with H+ migrating across a CEL from an acidic anolyte27. These species then convert back to CO2 and water, but this requires an acidic anolyte and iridium anode28,29,30. When operated in reverse bias, a BPM dissociates water into H+ that goes to the cathode and OH− that goes to the anode31 (Fig. 1b). Such a configuration plays two roles: First, the H+ transported to the cathode regenerates (bi)carbonates back to CO2, increasing the CO2 utilization and minimizing the CO2 crossover. Second, the hydroxide transported to the anode can be used to replenish the OH− consumed by the OER, thus maintaining an alkaline environment and thus enabling in principle a PGM-free anode32,33,34,35. Substantial research has focused on the carbon utilization benefits of r-BPMs, while the second advantage of PGM-free anodes has been somewhat taken for granted36,37.

To maintain an alkaline environment at the anode, each OH− consumed by the OER must be replenished via the water dissociation reaction (WDR) in the BPM. However, the co-ion crossover of cation and (bi)carbonate species lowers the ionic current from water dissociation, causing an imbalance between OH− generation and consumption. This nonunity water dissociation efficiency (WDE) leads to anolyte acidification over time (Fig. 1c). Previous studies have shown co-ion transport in commercial (Fumatech) BPMs at a rate equivalent to 0.1–4 mA cm−2 (refs. 38,39,40,41,42,43,44), and modeling and experiments have shown that co-ion crossover is related to the limiting current density45. Notably co-ion crossover is a common feature for all types of ion-exchange membrane, with membrane thickness and swelling factors resulting in ion selectivity and conductivity trade-offs. Recent developments in bipolar membranes have trended toward more conductive membrane layers and the use of water dissociation catalysts to lower voltages46,47,48. These features lower the membrane resistance but cause a higher limiting current density, suggesting higher crossover rates as a result. Most works, however, only examine co-ion crossover and WDE using liquids on either side of the BPM, but not in an MEA configuration where ionic concentration gradients are substantial. As shown in electrodialysis applications, the crossover also depends on the pH, current density, electrolyte concentration and ion type38,40.

The nonzero crossover, and resulting nonunity WDE, then raises the question of what level of cation and (bi)carbonate crossover is acceptable to maintain alkaline conditions at the anode of a r-BPM CO2 electrolyzer for industrial lifetimes of 10,000-40,000 h (refs. 49,50). By extension, one can ask: What are the system-wide penalties associated with continually replenishing KOH or CsOH anolytes as they slowly acidify? Answering these questions will help elucidate the viability of using r-BPMs for CO2 electrolysis and, subsequently, the promise of using PGM-free anodes.

Here, we experimentally probe the degree to which a r-BPM can inhibit co-ion crossover and maintain an alkaline anolyte environment. To aid in this analysis, we provide a methodology to experimentally determine the WDE of a r-BPM MEA CO2 electrolyzer under different process conditions. Here, the WDE allows us to understand the distribution of the ionic current crossing a membrane and thus predict anolyte composition changes over time. On the basis of the experimental results, we created a model that simulates the anolyte pH over time and, hence, the long-term stability of nickel-based anodes. In addition, we analyze possible mitigation strategies to address co-ion transport and their trade-offs with other performance metrics such as the cell voltage and selectivity. We thereby present criteria for and context regarding the feasibility of using r-BPM to replace PGM anodes in CO2 electrolysis applications.

To determine the anolyte's pH stability over time in r-BPM MEA electrolyzers (r-BPMEAs), we need to quantify the co-ion crossover and subsequently the WDE of the membrane during operation. The WDE of a r-BPM can be defined as the ratio between the partial current density of OH− or H+ generated by the BPM and the total current density applied (equation (1)). In essence, the net ionic current crossing a BPM must be equal to the electrical current, and at 100% WDE, the ionic current fully comes from the water dissociation species (equation (2)). In the absence of a catholyte, the WDE is a direct measure inferred from changes to the anolyte composition as a result of the co-ion crossover (for example, K+ and HCO3−/CO32−)41. Extracting the WDE experimentally then allows for its use in predicting the long-term stability of PGM-free anodes by contrasting its value with the consumption of OH− via the OER.

To quantify the WDE during CO2 electrolysis in an MEA, we performed chronoamperometry experiments and took aliquots of the anolyte to measure the ionic fluxes of potassium and (bi)carbonates (Fig. 2a). Through titration of the anolyte sample (Fig. 2b), we can determine the hydroxide and carbonate concentrations, which gives the average (bi)carbonate flux over a given operating time (Supplementary Note 1). Assuming electroneutrality of the anolyte, the flux of potassium can be determined similarly, allowing for the WDE to be calculated from the co-ion fluxes (equation (3)). Using the WDE, it is then possible to characterize the molar flux of OH− generated by the BPM (\({J}_{{\mathrm{OH}}^{-},\mathrm{BPM}}\)) (equation (4)).

Using the methodology from ‘Quantifying the co-ion crossover and WDE in r-BPMEA configurations' section, we quantified the WDE for a commercial Fumasep BPM under current densities from 25 to 250 mA cm−2, beginning with a 1 M KOH anolyte (see Supplementary Note 2 for further details). As shown in Fig. 3a, all the current densities exhibited WDE values lower than 100%, with increasing WDE values as the current density was increased. A peak WDE of ~98 % was observed at 250 mA cm−2, which is the highest value reported for the different variables analyzed. Such a value implies that, during operation, 98% of the ionic current is provided via the BPM's WDR while 2% of the ionic flux comes from potassium and (bi)carbonates.

The nonideal WDE and the carbonate crossover lead to an anolyte pH drop, which causes corrosion of the Ni anode (and cell failure after only 4 h). The experimental conditions were 20 ml of 0.1 M KOH at 100 mA cm−2. Inset: the corroded Ni anode after the experiment.

Source data

In all the experiments, we observed a co-ion current of cations and bicarbonate ions traveling through the membrane (Fig. 3b) and present a comparative distribution of these ionic fluxes. The respective partial current densities for co-ions fall within the range of 5–10 mA cm−2. Note that the crossovers in MEA configurations are slightly higher than those observed in BPMs operating with liquid on either side40,42,51. We believe that the higher concentration gradients in MEA cells might lead to the observed crossover rate differences.

To probe the implications of a given WDE value for anolyte stability, we performed an extended experiment of 4 h at 100 mA cm−2 with a small anolyte volume of 20 ml of 0.1 M KOH (Fig. 3c). These conditions resulted in a measured WDE of 96.5% (Fig. 4a), the highest value measured in this work at 100 mA cm−2. Here, we found that the Ni anode corroded in less than 4 h, implying that the combination of a r-BPM with a WDE of 96.5%, anolyte volume of 20 ml of 0.1 M KOH and a 5-cm2 electrode was greatly insufficient to maintain a stable anolyte as required for the use of PGM-free anodes.

Source data

With these base experiments examined, we sought a clearer understanding of the mechanisms of co-ion transport and its dependence on different process variables. We can then see how the WDE can be maximized, while clarifying the trade-offs between minimizing co-ion crossover and improving CO2 electrolysis performance metrics (cell voltage and selectivity).

Transport of co-ions, such as potassium and bicarbonate, can occur via two different mechanisms: diffusion, in which the driving force is a concentration gradient, and migration, which is based on transport created by an electric field. The sum of these two transport mechanisms results in the total flux that is measured experimentally. The effect of each individual mechanism was studied by analyzing separately changes in the current density (Fig. 3a) and the concentration gradient (Fig. 4a).

First, the WDE can be maximized by increasing the current density through membrane voltage-induced effects32,38,44. From 25 to 100 mA cm−2, there is an approximately one-third decrease in the total partial current density of co-ions (Fig. 3a). At higher current densities, the concentration polarization becomes more pronounced, steepening the ionic concentration gradients within the cell. This reduces the effective driving force for co-ion migration, thereby lowering their net crossover39,52. In addition, the intensified outward fluxes of H+ and OH− from the BPM can also increase the friction with the inward moving co-ions, decreasing their crossover owing to concentrated ion–ion interactions53,54,55.

Beyond 100 mA cm−2, the co-ion flux decrease is minimal. Similar behavior has been reported in BPM water electrolyzers (BPMWEs), where increasing the current density from 50 to 500 mA cm−2 led to a comparable plateau54. After a certain point, increases in the current density no longer strongly enhance the selectivity of the BPM, indicating that membrane voltage effects have saturated. In our results, the co-ion flux can be further minimized by decreasing the anolyte concentration, hence decreasing the K+ diffusive flux (Fig. 4a). At 0.1 M KOH, we measured our lowest co-ion fluxes, decreasing the plateau to ~4 mA cm−2 and giving a WDE of 96.5% at 100 mA cm−2. In contrast, an increase in the KOH concentration (≥2 M) resulted in an abrupt co-ion transport enhancement due to Donnan exclusion failure, recording a WDE of 80% and jco-ions of 25 mA cm−2 at 3 M KOH. When comparing the sensitivity of the co-ion fluxes to increases in current density and concentration (Fig. 4b), we conclude that both diffusion and migration have a similar impact (of the same order of magnitude) on the co-ion transport in a r-BPMEA CO2 electrolyzer and therefore that both make a nonnegligible contribution to the crossover of potassium and (bi)carbonate ions across the BPM.

Isolating the total co-ion partial current densities for each of the ions, we observe a correlation between the K+ and HCO3− fluxes, as a decrease in K+ flux is followed by a decrease in the HCO3− flux (Fig. 4c). The ratio between the HCO3− and K+ fluxes is independent of the current density, being constant at around 2 (Supplementary Fig. 1). However, this ratio increases when decreasing the anolyte K+ concentration as the K+ fluxes are decreased with respect to those of HCO3−. These trends are further corroborated when using a 2 M KOH anolyte and varying the current density (Supplementary Fig. 2), implying that the K+ diffusive fluxes have a determinant effect on the co-ion transport dynamics. Although these trends can be explained and the correlation between co-ion transport has been observed previously42, the reasoning behind the ratio values obtained remains unclear to us, and we suspect that it may be related to the cathode microenvironment and its dependence on the Faradaic efficiency towards CO.

To further examine the role of co-ion transport in our system, we changed the cation in the anolyte to Cs+ (Fig. 4d), which also has a positive influence on CO2 electrolysis. The use of CsOH resulted in a decrease in the overall WDE measured at each current density. The cationic fluxes of Cs+ and K+ through the BPM are equal in magnitude, which is due to their similar ion transport properties (Fig. 4e). However, the use of Cs+ ions causes an increase in the HCO3− fluxes (Fig. 4f), which is responsible for the WDE decrease observed in Fig. 4d. Despite the negative effect of Cs+ on the WDE, using Cs ions can positively boost the FE(CO) up to 60–70%, in comparison with the values of 30–40% recorded with K+ ions56,57,58,59 (Supplementary Fig. 3).

In summary, the local concentration of the co-ions plays a key role in the co-ion transport dynamics in the BPM, as both the diffusive and migrative fluxes are dependent on it. From a process point of view, higher current densities and lower anolyte concentrations have been shown to have the best effects in terms of increasing the WDE and thus minimizing the co-ion crossover. However, both have a negative impact on the cell voltage (7 V at 250 mA cm−2 and 3 V higher than for an AEM CO2 electrolyzer; Supplementary Fig. 4) and CO2 reduction selectivity (Supplementary Fig. 5). Similarly, the co-ion transport could also be influenced by tuning the chemical and physical properties of the BPM. Among commercially available BPMs, the Fumasep BPM stands out as one of the best in terms of minimizing the crossover and the WDR overpotentials40. However, their low operational limit (<100 mA cm−2) imposes substantial challenges when used in electrolysis. Higher currents can be obtained by using state-of-the-art BPMs46,47,48,60,61,62,63. These advanced BPMs aim to decrease the energy consumption, focusing on WD catalysts to minimize the WDR overpotential and individual layer properties such as thinner layers or a higher ion-exchange capacity to enhance the ionic transport. The impact of such strategies, however, involves a well-known trade-off with an increase of the co-ion transport64,65. Therefore, we believe that BPMs with WDEs >99% are unlikely to be realistically applied in an industrially relevant scenario given the trade-offs between WDE, selectivity and cell voltage presented here, especially considering the known need to improve the performance of r-BPM CO2 electrolyzers in terms of selectivity and cell voltages24.

The experimental results in the previous section indicated that achieving near-unity WDEs is not possible owing to unavoidable co-ion transport and that near-unity WDEs would probably hurt CO2 electrolysis performance metrics. In this section, we ask a different question: What combination of WDE values and anolyte volumes would enable PGM-free anodes to be used over industrially relevant operational times of >10,000 h? While higher WDEs enable higher fractions of OH− to be replenished for the OER reaction, higher anolyte volumes can also ensure that elevated pH conditions are maintained, even as OH− is slowly depleted. To answer these questions, we built a model that predicts the change in the anolyte pH over time as a function of the WDE, anolyte volume, electrolyzer area and current density. We can then define an operational stability window of a Ni-based anode as the time required for the pH of the anolyte to drop below 1222,23,66,67.

The model developed consists of a time-dependent mass balance for the different species present on the anode side of the r-BPMEA CO2 electrolyzer. The control volume considers the experimental fluxes of the species transported across the BPM ((bi)carbonates, OH− and K+) and the tank in which the anolyte is being recirculated. Within the model, we consider carbonate equilibrium, the pH changes related to OH− consumption via OER and OH− regeneration from the BPM (Supplementary Note 3).

As highlighted in Fig. 5a for a 5-cm2 cell at 200 mA cm−2, the time until Ni anode corrosion varies directly with both the WDE and the utilized anolyte volume. Here, the WDE sets the consumption rate of OH− over a unit of time, while the anolyte volume sets the reservoir of OH− that can be consumed before the pH decreases to the point of Ni corrosion. These results show that, for a 5-cm2 cell, a 1 l anolyte volume can reach 10,000-h stabilities only if the WDE >99.8%, which we believe to be an unachievable efficiency, as the highest WDE value measured from our BPM-based MEA was ~98%. Increasing the anolyte volume to 10 l then pushes the minimum WDE threshold to >98% to reach 10,000 h.

These results raise the question of how large the anolyte volume can reasonably be to offset lower WDE values. For this exercise, we also need to consider the total volume of anolyte that would be needed for an industrial-scale electrolyzer, for example, a ~3–5-MW electrolyzer consisting of 100 cells stacked together, each with an active area of 5 m2. Figure 5b then compares the volume of anolyte required to operate a r-BPMEA CO2 electrolyzer for at least 10,000 h as a function of the WDE for three sizes of electrolyzers. Considering that the maximum WDE obtained experimentally is 98%, a 5-cm2 cell then requires 10 l as noted above. While 10 l might not seem like too much when thinking about a 5-cm2 laboratory-scale electrolyzer, this translates to 107 l (10,000 m3) for the 100-cell 5-m2 electrolyzer. These volumes translate to a consumption of approximately four Olympic swimming pools of KOH after every 10,000 h of operation (Fig. 5c), equal to 24 m3 day−1 for a single 3–5-MW electrolyzer. These quantities represent both a substantial volume and consumption rate of KOH that appear prohibitive without much higher WDE values or on-site anolyte regeneration.

One potential route to bring down the volume of anolyte needed to a reasonably sized electrolyte tank is to periodically regenerate the anolyte. The regeneration process would again utilize BPMs, but in the form of BPM electrodialysis (BPMED), which uses a pH swing (Supplementary Fig. 6). Briefly, the anolyte is made acidic in the BPMED process, causing the inorganic carbon species to be removed as CO2 gas from the electrolyte. Subsequently, the pH is brought back to alkaline state in the BPMED process, which results in a regenerated KOH solution, similar to in BPMED-based direct air capture68,69. Anolyte regeneration comes with its own energy and system costs, which would be proportional to the achievable WDE, but it would enable a cyclical process without constant fresh KOH.

Here, we briefly estimate and compare the energy costs of the r-BPMEA CO2 electrolyzer versus the BPMED regeneration unit. We assume from literature that a BPMED unit requires between 250 and 1,000 kJ molCO2 extracted70,71,72, equating to ~2.3–8.9 MJ kg−1 of KOH electrolyte regenerated (where 1 mol CO2 released is equivalent to 2 mol KOH regenerated). Meanwhile a r-BPMEA CO2 electrolyzer operating at a cell voltage of 3.5 V and an FE(CO) of 60% requires ~40 MJ kgCO produced. Supplementary Fig. 7 shows the ratio of CO produced versus KOH consumed as a function of the WDE for an FE(CO) of 60% (see Supplementary Note 4 for the derivation of the ratio). For the case with a WDE of 90%, 1.1 kg of KOH is required for every 1 kg of CO produced. Using the above energy values, at these conditions, the regeneration unit would then require about 6–25% of the energy used by the CO2 electrolyzer. Higher WDE and FE(CO) values would decrease these energy requirements linearly and inversely, respectively.

Combining all of the above analysis together, we see substantial challenges in a r-BPM system being practically used with PGM-free anodes. Co-ion crossover is unlikely to be eliminated to the degree required for KOH consumption to be acceptable from a pure anolyte consumption perspective (>99.8%), and current BPMs currently achieve WDE values <98%. Even higher WDE values are seen to negatively impact the CO2 reduction performance. We then conclude that any membrane choice for CO2 electrolyzers (AEM, CEM, f-BPM or r-BPM) would necessitate regeneration of the anolyte or the use of acidic and neutral pH-stable anodes such as IrO2.

At first glance, we may expect that the issue of anode stability and PGM anodes could be negated by switching away from the OER to an alternate anodic reaction such as glycerol oxidation. However, many aqueous anodic reactions still consume OH− in alkaline conditions, driving the pH to acidic or neutral conditions again73. Once in this regime, PGM-free electrodes such as transition metals and carbon are again unstable. Therefore, we expect that the co-ion leakage challenges identified here for r-BPM CO2 electrolyzers will also arise when coupled with other anodic reactions.

Reverse-bias BPMs are still a configuration that limits CO2 crossover, improves utilization and partially decreases the transport of contaminants such as leached ions from corroded Ir-based or PGM-free anodes. However, these benefits are unlikely to offset the substantial added voltage requirements alone. Reverse-bias BPM CO2 electrolyzers incur higher costs than other membrane configurations owing to their greater electricity expenses, relatively low achievable current densities and consequently larger electrolyzer size, which translates into higher material replacement costs74. In addition, it is reported that the extra voltage required for the WDR will not justify the related energy expenses to prevent crossover and that an anodic downstream gas separation is most likely to be less energy consuming75.

While not the central focus of this work, these volume discussions provide reflection on laboratory-scale experiments that commonly use anolyte volumes on the order of 0.1 l for a 5-cm2 electrolyzer. As recently raised in other works, electrolyte tank costs are being overlooked when estimating flow batteries economics76. So far, to our knowledge, no work has considered the importance of the dimensions of anolyte tanks in CO2 electrolysis. We believe that this is a must to bridge the gap between laboratory research and industrial feasibility. Specifically, in cases such as in r-BPMEA, we show that stability claims are based on the magnitude of the utilized volume, emphasizing the importance of reasonably matching anolyte volumes with electrochemical cell dimensions. This will facilitate the translation of laboratory-scale experiments to more industrial processes and raise awareness of what are realistic experimental conditions for applied research. Additionally, even for systems such as AEM CO2 electrolyzers, the overuse of electrolyte volumes may be masking myriad stability or scale-up issues that are then only observed in pilot plants.

This work addresses the general assumption in literature that reverse-bias BPM can enable the use of PGM-free anodes in CO2 electrolyzers. We have shown that the WDE can be used to characterize the black box of a r-BPMEA CO2 electrolyzer and predict the long-term stability of anolytes that are required for PGM-free anodes. The WDE makes a nonnegligible contribution to the process design for a r-BPM CO2 electrolyzer, as its value is directly linked to the amount of anolyte required as a reactant for the anodic OER. WDE values 99.8% are required to avoid additional measures in anolyte treatment. However, we have reported a maximum WDE value of 98% for commercially available BPMs. We believe that eliminating crossover to the extent required is unrealistic, as a trade-off with other cell performance metrics, such as cell voltage and CO2R selectivity, is found. Consequently, we conclude that, independently of any membrane type chosen, CO2 electrolyzers at an industrial scale will require additional anolyte treatments or operate at neutral or acidic conditions, requiring the use of catalysts that are stable under these conditions.

CO2 electrolysis experiments were performed in a 5-cm2 MEA cell from Dioxide Materials. The cell was assembled with a cathode, an anode and a membrane, compressed with a torque of 2.5 N m. The cathode was prepared by sputtering 100 nm of Ag onto a Sigracet 39BB gas diffusion layer. For the anode, nickel foam (Ni-4753.005 from Recemat BV) was used. A bipolar membrane (Fumasep FBM, Quintech) in reverse bias separated the cathode and the anode. The BPM employed, with a thickness of ~130–160 µm and a maximum operating current density of 100 mA cm−2, consisted of a CEL of sulfonated crosslinked poly-ether ether ketone and an AEL made of polysulfone with quaternary ammonium groups.

The electrochemical setup was connected to our electrolysis standard setup equipped with a potentiostat (PARSTAT MC), mass flow meter and controller and gas chromatograph (GAS compact 4.0)18. Humidified CO2 was supplied to the inlet at the cathode side at a constant flow rate of 50 s.c.c.m. The cathodic outlet volumetric flow was quantified by a mass flow meter, and its composition was analyzed by the gas chromatograph to determine the CO2 electrolysis Faradaic efficiencies (Supplementary Note 5). Similarly, at the anode side, an alkaline electrolyte (KOH or CsOH) was continuously flowed and recirculated at 20 ml min−1.

The WDE was experimentally determined under different process conditions involving a range of current densities, concentrations and anolyte identity (Supplementary Note 3). To guarantee good reproducibility within all experiments, WDE determinations were performed at a constant current density for 1 h with an anolyte volume of 90 ml.

The WDE was obtained from the concentration of the cation (K+ or Cs+), the carbon species (CO32−) and the hydroxide (OH−) in the anolyte before and after performing CO2 electrolysis. From the difference in concentration between the samples (before, \({c}_{i,\mathrm{co}\text{-}\mathrm{ion}}^{0}\) and after, \({c}_{i,\mathrm{co}\text{-}\mathrm{ion}}^{\mathrm{end}}\)), the molar fluxes for each of the species ‘i' (Ji,co-ion) are obtained by using equation (5) and then plugged into the WDE equation (equation (3)). Vtank, A and tCP refer, respectively, to the anolyte volume, the electrochemical active area and the electrolysis operation time. 

Warder's acid–base titration77 was used to determine the concentration of CO32− and OH− in the anolyte. Since the initial volume was high enough (90 ml) and the pH of the anolyte remains highly alkaline (pH >12), we assumed that all carbon measured is in the form of CO32−. The titrations were performed using a 848 Titrino Plus titrator (Metrohm) with a 0.1 N HCl standardized solution (\({c}_{\mathrm{HCl}}\)) as titrant. Supplementary Fig. 8 shows an example of a before and after electrolysis titration curve. In the zoom-in curves, one can identify the existing equivalence points for each of the cases.

Before CO2 electrolysis, we assumed that no carbonate was present (equation (6)) as anolyte was freshly prepared, and that only one equivalent point (\({V}_{\mathrm{EP},0}\)) was obtained from the neutralization of H+ with OH− (equation (7)). \({V}_{\mathrm{titrate}}\) is the volume of anolyte sample taken for titration, ranging from 1 to 10 ml depending on the original anolyte concentration.

On the other hand, after CO2 electrolysis, the concentration of both CO32− \({c}_{{\mathrm{CO}}_{3}^{2-}}^{\mathrm{end}}\) and OH− \({c}_{{\mathrm{OH}}^{-}}^{\mathrm{end}}\) (equation (8) and (9), respectively) can be obtained directly from the volume of titrant used for both equivalence points (\({V}_{\mathrm{EP},1}\) and \({V}_{\mathrm{EP},2}\)). \({V}_{\mathrm{EP},1}\) corresponds to the equivalence point between CO32− and HCO3−, whereas \({V}_{\mathrm{EP},2}\) represents the equivalent point of CO2 and HCO3−.

The K+ concentrations \({c}_{{\mathrm{K}}^{\mathrm{+}}}\) can then be obtained by applying the principle of electroneutrality (equation (10)).

Aqueous zinc metal batteries are ideal candidates for grid storage applications. However, their practical application is hindered by a narrow operating temperature range and a limited electrolyte electrochemical stability window, both of which can be attributed to the water activity. Here, to minimize water activity in the electrolyte solution, we introduce a nanoengineered approach in which the water molecules are confined within a hydrophilic–hydrophobic water solvation sheath. The hydrogen-bond interaction with the hydrophilic groups in the inner solvation layer effectively suppresses water decomposition, and the hydrophobic solvents in the outer solvation layer establish a repulsive effect against water molecules. As a proof of concept, a hydrophobic and non-polar hydrofluoroether cosolvent is introduced into a Zn-ion aqueous electrolyte solution and tested together with various fluorinated hydrotrope molecules to favour the compatibility of the cosolvent with water. By such a water confinement strategy, an average Zn plating/stripping reversibility of 99.92% is achieved for over 4,000 cycles at 2.0 mA cm−2 and 2.0 mAh cm−2 in a Zn||Cu coin cell configuration. When tested in a Zn||VOPO4·2H2O lab-scale cell configuration, the selected aqueous-hydrotrope hybrid electrolyte solution enables long-lasting and highly reversible battery performance across temperatures from −80 °C to +60 °C.

If your current TV speakers aren't impressing you, the easiest way to upgrade your movie night is with a sound bar. Our favorite compact option, where you might have limited space or a smaller room, is the Bose Smart Soundbar. It's currently marked down to $400 at retailers like Amazon and Best Buy, a discount of at least $100. It's easy to use, small enough to squeeze into tight spots, and still has all the features you'd expect from a soundbar.

Despite the tiny footprint, the Bose Smart Soundbar is capable of surprisingly expansive sound, which our reviewer Ryan Waniata calls out in particular, even if you're just watching sports. Without a dedicated subwoofer, it lacks some punch in the bass department, but is still impressive, with surprising clarity, especially considering how little space it takes up. Because it sports Bluetooth, you can even use it as a dedicated speaker for music, a role it handles quite well.

The Smart Soundbar comes with a variety of intelligent features designed to enhance your viewing experience. We called out the AI Dialogue mode in particular, and were impressed by its ability to help speech stand out, without distorting the other background audio and music. If you often find yourself rewinding or asking what a character said, this soundbar is worth looking into for this feature on its own.

It also has another neat trick Bose calls Personal Surround. By pairing the soundbar with a set of the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, you can incorporate them into your surround setup. The open earbuds still let you hear the soundbar, creating an immersive mix that's made even more potent by Dolby Atmos support.

If you have the extra space, you may still want to consider one of our other favorite soundbars, which can take advantage of that room to add a dedicated subwoofer, or more drivers.

                                GeekWire Gala: Last chance for early bird tix!

Creating a virtual brain may sound like a science-fiction nightmare, but for neuroscientists in Japan and at Seattle's Allen Institute, it's a big step toward a long-held dream.

They say their mouse-cortex simulation, run on one of the world's fastest supercomputers, could eventually open the way to understanding the mechanisms behind maladies such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy — and perhaps unraveling the mysteries of consciousness.

“This shows the door is open,” Allen Institute investigator Anton Arkhipov said today in a news release. “It's a technical milestone giving us confidence that much larger models are not only possible, but achievable with precision and scale.”

Arkhipov and his colleagues describe the project in a research paper being presented this week in St. Louis during the SC25 conference on high-performance computing. The simulation models the activity of a whole mouse cortex, encompassing nearly 10 million neurons connected by 26 billion synapses. 

To create the simulation, researchers fed data from the Allen Cell Types Database and the Allen Connectivity Atlas into Supercomputer Fugaku, a computing cluster developed by Fujitsu and Japan's RIKEN Center for Computational Science. Fugaku is capable of executing more than 400 quadrillion operations per second, or 400 petaflops.

The massive data set was translated into a 3-D model using the Allen Institute's Brain Modeling ToolKit. A simulation program called Neulite brought the data to life as virtual neurons that interact with each other like living brain cells.

Scientists ran the program in different scenarios, including an experiment that used the full-scale Fugaku configuration to model the entire mouse cortex.

“In our simulation, each neuron is modeled as a large tree of interacting compartments — hundreds of compartments per neuron,” Arkhipov said in comments emailed to GeekWire. “That is, we are capturing some sub-cellular structures and dynamics within each neuron.”

During the full-scale simulation, it took no more than 32 seconds to simulate one second of real-time activity in a living mouse brain. “This level of performance — 32 times slower than real time — is quite impressive for a system of this size and complexity,” Arkhipov said. “It is not uncommon to see a factor of thousands of times slower for such very detailed simulations (even much smaller than ours).”

The researchers acknowledge that much more work is needed to turn their simulation into a model capable of tracing the progress of a neurological disease. For example, the model doesn't reflect brain plasticity — that is, the brain's ability to rewire its own connections. 

“If we want to mention something specific besides plasticity, then one aspect that is missing is the effects of neuromodulators, and the other is that we currently do not have a very detailed representation of sensory inputs in our whole-cortex simulations,” Arkhipov said. “For all of these, we need much more data than currently available to make much better models, although some approximations or hypotheses could be implemented and tested now that we have a working whole-cortex simulation.”

Arkhipov said the project's long-term goal is to simulate an entire brain, not just the cortex.  “There's a distinction between whole-cortex and whole-brain,” he pointed out. “The mouse cortex (and our model of it) contains about 10 million neurons, whereas the whole mouse brain contains about 70 million neurons.”

A human-brain simulation would require an even greater leap. The human cortex alone contains not just 10 million neurons, but 21 billion.

The good news is that a sufficiently powerful supercomputer might be up to the task. “Our work shows that very detailed microscopic-level simulations of larger brains may be possible sooner than previously expected,” Arkhipov said. “The results suggest that a simulation of the whole monkey brain (such as that of a macaque monkey with 6 billion neurons) can fit on the full-scale Fugaku system.”

Arkhipov said it was important to point out that creating a brain model on a supercomputer “does not mean that such a model is complete or accurate.”

“Here we are talking about technical feasibility of simulations, and it looks like such simulations even at the scale of the monkey brain are now within reach,” he said. “But to make such simulations biologically realistic, much more experimental data production and model building work would need to happen.”

Rin Kuriyama and Kaaya Akira of the University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo are the principal authors of the paper presented at SC25, titled “Microscopic-Level Mouse Whole Cortex Simulation Composed of 9 Million Biophysical Neurons and 26 Billion Synapses on the Supercomputer Fugaku.” In addition to Arkhipov, authors from the Allen Institute include Laura Green, Beatriz Herrera and Kael Dai. The study's other authors are Tadashi Yamazaki and Mari Iura of the University of Electro-Communications; Gilles Gouaillardet and Asako Terasawa of the Research Organization for Information Science and Technology in Hyogo, Japan; Taira Kobayashi of Yamaguchi University; and Jun Igarashi of the RIKEN Center for Computational Science.

Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos seems to be getting his hands dirty once again: The billionaire is partly backing a new AI startup called Project Prometheus that has raised $6.2 billion in funding, and will take on duties as co-chief executive of the new venture, The New York Times reported, citing several sources familiar with the project.

Bezos will share the position with Vik Bajaj, who previously led and co-founded Google's life sciences division. Bajaj also co-founded Verily, a biotech startup owned by Alphabet, and is the co-founder of Foresite Labs, an AI-focused affiliate of investment firm Foresite Capital, though the report notes he recently left the firm to start Prometheus, the report said.

Bezos would be returning to operations for the first time since he stepped away from Amazon in 2021.

According to the NYT, the startup is going to build AI products for engineering and manufacturing in various fields like computers, aerospace, and automobiles. Project Prometheus is focused on “AI for the physical economy,” per its LinkedIn page, and the report noted that its work will resemble that of Periodic Labs, which is building technology to speed up scientific research by simulating the physical world to train AI models.

The company already has almost 100 staff, including researchers from AI firms like Meta, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind, the report said.

Amazon and Bajaj did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

If you pay attention to what the biggest tech companies are saying about AI demand, you'll notice a common thread: they're running short of compute capacity. That means the large language models underpinning AI products today need even more data centers to be trained and for inferencing, and therefore, they need more power. Against that backdrop, energy efficiency has suddenly become a critical priority for semiconductor manufacturers. 

PowerLattice, a startup founded by veteran electrical engineers from Qualcomm, NUVIA, and Intel in 2023, claims to have developed a groundbreaking approach that reduces the power needs of computer chips by more than 50%. On Monday, the startup emerged from stealth with a $25 million Series A funding round led by Playground Global and Celesta Capital, bringing its total funding to $31 million.

“This is the hard stuff: How do you get power into the device? There are very few teams and people that can do it,” said Pat Gelsinger, general partner at Playground Global. “We have assembled what I'd argue is the dream team of power delivery.”

As the former CEO of Intel, Gelsinger carries significant authority in the semiconductor world, which makes his participation a powerful stamp of approval for PowerLattice.

In fact, when the startup's CEO Dr. Peng Zou and its founding team pitched their idea at Playground's offices in March, they were so star-struck by Gelsinger's fame that they asked him for a selfie, Gelsinger told TechCrunch. The admiration proved mutual, as Gelsinger came away genuinely impressed with PowerLattice's technology.

The startup's tech sounds simple in concept: a tiny power delivery chiplet that's designed to bring power closer to the processor, significantly minimizing energy loss.

Two years in, PowerLattice has already achieved its first key milestone: Its first batch of chiplets is being produced by TSMC, in partnership with an unnamed manufacturer that is testing the startup's functionality, Gelsinger said.

Beyond its initial customer, the startup plans to make its product available for testing by other customers in the first half of 2026. The trials should prove instructive, given that PowerLattice's potential customer set includes major chip manufacturers Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD, as well as specialized AI chip developers, such as Cerberus, Grok, and Playground-backed startups d-Matrix and NextSilicon.

Although every chip company has internal teams working on improving energy efficiency, Gelsinger hopes that PowerLattice's innovative approach will pique their interest.

“They may say, ‘I'm going to take some volume to this approach, some volume to my more traditional approach',” he said. “But we think our ability to capture meaningful share will quickly emerge.”

PowerLattice is not the only startup attempting to help chip manufacturers address the energy problem. The company would compete most closely with Empower Semiconductor, a startup that raised a $140 million Series D, led by Fidelity Management & Research Company, in September.

However, Gelsinger is certain that PowerLattice's 50% energy efficiency gain is an “extraordinary” result, and he expects the company to soon raise a much larger funding round to fund production.

“The idea is bold, the benefits are large, and I expect others will be saying, ‘That's a great idea. Let me try as well,'” Gelsinger said.

Swedish automaker Volvo has cancelled a five-year-old contract with Luminar, the latest escalation in an increasingly-ugly brawl between the lidar sensor company and its biggest customer.

The fight is happening during an existential moment for Luminar. The company recently defaulted on several of its loans. While it's working with those lenders on a resolution, Luminar has warned investors it may have to declare bankruptcy.

To stave that off, Luminar recently laid off 25% of its staff and is trying to sell itself — or parts of itself — to potential buyers. One of them is Luminar founder Austin Russell, who resigned from the CEO role in May during an ethics inquiry. Luminar is also being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, recent filings reveal.

“Volvo Cars has made this decision to limit the company's supply chain risk exposure and it is a direct result of Luminar's failure to meet its contractual obligations to Volvo Cars,” the automaker said in a statement to TechCrunch. Luminar did not respond to a request for comment.

Volvo is not just a Luminar customer. The two companies have spent much of the last decade working together. Volvo invested in Luminar and helped the Florida-based startup get into some of its first production vehicles. 

The relationship has been mutually beneficial. Luminar's tech gave Volvo the confidence to dish out big promises about making the roads safer by offering automated driving features. Volvo gave Luminar credibility ahead of a 2020 SPAC merger that made Russell one of the youngest self-made billionaires ever.

But Luminar has faced challenges as a public company. It struggled to diversify away from Volvo, and in 2024 cut a fifth of its staff while deciding to outsource manufacturing of its sensors. Then, in May of this year, Russell abruptly resigned as Luminar revealed its board had opened a “code of business conduct and ethics” inquiry. 

The fight with Volvo bubbled to the surface on October 31. 

The company told shareholders in a regulatory filing on that day that Volvo decided to no longer make Luminar's “Iris” lidar a standard sensor on its EX90 and ES90 vehicles. Volvo also told Luminar that it had “deferred” the decision of whether to include its next-generation “Halo” sensor in the Swedish automaker's future vehicles. 

Luminar said in the filing that it had “made a claim against Volvo for significant damages” and “suspended further commitments of Iris” for the automaker. 

“The Company is in discussions with Volvo concerning the dispute; however, there can be no assurance that the dispute will be resolved favorably or at all,” Luminar wrote.

Volvo told TechCrunch Monday that its “products can deliver a high level of safety and driver support, enabled by the cars' powerful core computing coupled with their advanced sensor set – with or without a lidar.” But, it added, the “situation has an effect on some customer orders.” It did not immediately explain whether that meant a delay, or something else.

Volvo's decisions were not just a threat to Luminar's revenue — they also had knock-on effects for Luminar. In the October filing, Luminar said it stopped spending money on Iris sensors for Volvo, and in turn, the supplier that makes the sensors claimed this was a breach of their agreement.

This story has been updated with comments from Volvo.

Probably, the most important lesson (for someone who wants to fix their washing machine ASAP) that I learned from that was that there are non-userserviceable error codes and you need to perform an undocumented procedure on your machine to get those codes. I wrote about it in more detail here: https://andri.yngvason.is/repairing-the-washing-machine.htmlI would have loved to have an open source diagnostics dongle for my AEG. Maybe next time I'll try and make one. :)

I'd imagine someone more familiar with electronics possibly could have figured out what specific component was wrong and replaced only that for an even smaller fraction of the cost.

reply

The PCB had already been replaced twice during the warranty period. Googled the major components and they were $3 - $5 a piece, just a couple of half bridge rectifiers, resistors and diodes.Didn't want to risk a fire from a DIY job, which would have definitely voided my insurance, so I spent $400 on a new central vacuum unit (from a different brand).

When after some time the water pump on my 2014 Miele dishwasher gave up the ghost, I had a look at their parts catalogue. I had mixed feelings.On one hand, they still produce parts for things they sold in 2008, maybe even earlier, I was looking for a pump. Very repair-friendly, very anti-ewaste. Kudos.On the other hand, for the price they have of that pump and labor, I could buy a perfectly serviceable new midrange Bosch thing. Which I, after a short inner struggle, did. After all, the pump may have been the tip of an iceberg of more costly repairs. It's a real Apple or Porsche of home appliances — it costs a lot when you buy it, and then it keeps costing you later.But maybe this knowledge is going to be handy with the Miele fridge I still have...

False on both counts.Both Apple and Miele offer Self Service Repair.Specifically in the case of Miele (since its the subject of this thread), you can buy spares directly from Miele.  They openly show exploded parts diagrams on their website, and if you can't find it, you can call their parts sales number.

With the caveat that the prices are ridiculously high to encourage you to just buy a new one. My brand new Miele C3 vacuum cost 300 EUR and I just checked the official spare parts store you mentioned. Replacement handle is 90 EUR (not including the telescopic pipe, that's another 80 EUR, or hose, that's another 40 EUR), cable reel is 100 EUR, new motor is also 100 EUR, top plastic cover (which can't cost more than 5 EUR manufactured and delivered) costs 50 EUR, and so on.

There is an interesting thing happening in FOIA law here in WA (you'd never notice it from this spammy article, though). A pretty common FOIA exemption is for data not managed by a public body, but via some commercial vendor. FOIA generally only allows you to demand production of (1) actual documents that (2) the public body has (3) on hand (or are generally deemed to have on hand, such as email records).So it's pretty legally dubious that you can use FOIA to compel production from Flock (you can probably compel, from the public body, any number of reports Flock can generate --- we've done that here for our Flock network and sharing configurations, for instance).Here it sounds like a WA judge might be saying that some corpus of data Flock  maintains is effectively public data. If that's the case, that's a novel interpretation.

Again, you, as an end user, don't need to know any of that. The CRPS scorecard is a very specific measure of error. I don't expect them to reveal the technical details of the model, but an industry expert instantly knows what WeatherBench[1] is, the code it runs, the data it uses, and how that CRPS scorecard was generated.By having better dispersed ensemble forecasts, we can more quickly address observation gaps that may be needed to better solidify certain patterns or outcomes, which will lead to more accurate deterministic forecasts (aka the ones you get on your phone). These are a piece of the puzzle, though, and not one that you will ever actually encounter as a layperson.[1]: https://sites.research.google/gr/weatherbench/

Developing an ensemble of possible scenarios has been the central insight of weather forecasting since the 1960s when Edward Lorenz discovered that tiny differences in initial conditions can grow exponentially (the ""butterfly effect"").  Since they could really do it in the 90s, all competitive forecasts are based on these ensemble models.When you hear ""a 70% chance of rain,"" it more or less means ""there was rain in 70 of the 100 scenarios we ran.""[0] There is no ""single accurate forecast scenario.""[0] Acknowledging this dramatically oversimplifies the models and the location where the rain could occur.

Quite a lot of weather sites offer this data in an easily eatable visual format.

Sure, those big physics-based models are very computationally intensive (national weather bureaus run them on sizeable HPC clusters), but you only need to run them every few hours in a central location and then distribute the outputs online. It's not like every forecaster in a country needs to run a model, they just need online access to the outputs. Even if they could run the models themselves, they would still need the mountains of raw observation data that feeds the models (weather stations, satellite imagery, radars, wind profilers...). And these are usually distributed by... the national weather bureau of that country. So the weather bureau might as well do the number crunching as well and distribute that.

The accuracy improvement is provable. A four-day forecast today is as accurate as a one-day forecast 30 years ago.  And this is supremely impressive, because the difficulty of predicting the weather grows exponentially, not linearly, with time.You are welcome to your feelings - and to be fair, I'm not sure that our understanding of the weather has improved as much as our computational power to extend predictions has.

For example on Apple's Weather app, a ""rainy"" day means a high chance of rain at any point during the day. If it's 80% chance of rain at 5am and sunny the rest of the day– that counts as rainy. You can see an hourly report for more info, and generally this is pretty accurate. You have to learn how to find the right data, know your local area, and interpret it yourself.Then you have to consider what effects this has on your plans and it gets more complicated. Finding a window to walk the dog, choosing a day to go sailing, or determining conditions for backcountry skiing all have different requirements and resources. What I'd like AI to do is know my own interests and highlight what the forecast means for me.

Different models have different strengths, though. Some are shorter range (72h) or longer range (1-3 weeks). Some are higher resolution for where you live (the size of an area which it assigns a forecast to, so your forecast is more local).Some governments will have their own weather model for your country that is the most accurate for where you live. What I did for a long time was use Windy and use HDRPS (a Canadian short range model with a higher resolution in Canada so I have more accurate forecasts). Now I just use the government of Canada weather app.I genuinely wonder what the weather Channel, iPhone/Android official weather apps, etc. use under the hood for global models. My gut says ECMWF (a European model with global coverage) mixed with a little magic.

It's also 32 million lines of code which is borderline prohibitive to maintain if you're planning any importantly different browser architecture, without a business plan or significant funding.There's lots of things perfectly forkable and maintainable in the world is better for them (shoutout Nextcloud and the various Syncthing forks). But Chromium, insofar as it's a test of the health and openness of the software ecosystem, I think is not much of a positive signal on account of what it would realistically require to fork and maintain for any non-trivial repurposing.

I'm not so sure that's problematic. Probably browser just aren't a great platform for doing a lot of XML processing at this point.Preserving the half implemented frozen state of the early 2000s really doesn't really serve anyone except those maintaining legacy applications from that era. I can see why they are pulling out complex C++ code related to all this.It's the natural conclusion of XHTML being sidelined in favor of HTML 5 about 15-20 years ago. The whole web service bubble, bloated namespace processing, and all the other complexity that came with that just has a lot of gnarly libraries associated with it. The world kind of has moved on since then.From a security point of view it's probably a good idea to reduce the attack surface a bit by moving to a Rust based implementation. What use cases remain for XML parsing in a browser if XSLT support is removed? I guess some parsing from javascript. In which case you could argue that the usual solution in the JS world of using polyfills and e.g. wasm libraries might provide a valid/good enough alternative or migration path.

Admittedly this was 20ish years ago, but I used to teach the business analysts XSLT so they could create/edit/format their own reports.At the time Crystal Reports had become crazy expensive so I developed a system that would send the data to the browser as XML and then an XSLT to format the report. It provided basic interactivity and could be edited by people other than me. Also, if I remember, at the time it only worked in IE because it was the only browser with the transform function.

Functional programming languages can often feel declarative. When XSL is doing trivial, functional transformations, when you keep your hands off of xsl:for-each, XSL feels declarative, and doesn't feel that bad.The problem is: no clean API is perfectly shaped for UI, so you always wind up having to do arbitrary, non-trivial transformations with tricky uses of for-each to make the output HTML satisfy user requirements.XSL's ""escape hatch"" is to allow arbitrary Turing-complete transformations, with <xsl:variable>, <xsl:for-each>, and <xsl:if>. This makes easy transformations easy and hard transformations possible.XSL's escape hatch is always needed, but it's absolutely terrible, especially compared to JS, especially compared to modern frameworks.

This is patently false. It is much better for security if you use one of the many memory-safe implementations of it. This is like saying “SSL is insecure because I use an implementation with bugs”. No, the technology is fine. It's your buggy implementation that's the problem.

XSLT is a functional transform language. The equivalent JavaScript would be something like registry of pure functions of Node -> Node and associated selectors and a TreeWalker that walks the XML document, invokes matching functions, and emits the result into a new document.Or you could consume the XML as data into a set of React functions.

Looking only at how many sites use a feature gives you an incomplete view.

What's happening is that Google (along with Mozilla and Safari) are changing the html spec to drop support for xslt. If you want to argue that this is bad because it “breaks the web”, that's fine, but it has nothing at all to do with whether the web is “open”. The open web means anyone can run a web server. Anyone can write a web site. Anyone can build their own compatible browser (hypothetically; this has become prohibitively expensive). It means anyone can use the tech, not that the tech includes everything possible.If you want to complain about Google harming the open web, there are some real examples out there. Google Reader deprecation probably hurt RSS more than anything else. AMP was/is an attempt to give Google tighter control over more web traffic. Chrome extension changes were pushed through seemingly to give Google tighter control over ad blockers. Gemini in the search results is an attempt to keep Google users from ever actually clicking through to web sites for information.XSLT in the browser has been dead for years. The reality is that no browser developer has cared about xslt since 1.0. Don't blame Google for the death of xslt when xslt 2.0 was standardized before Chrome was even released and no one else cared enough to implement it. The removal of xslt doesn't change the openness of the web and the reality is that it breaks very little while eliminating a source of real security errors.

And, indeed, if the protocol was one killer app deprecation and removal away from being obsolete, the problem was the use case, not the protocol.(Personally, I don't think RSS is dead; it's very much alive in podcasting. What's dead is people consuming content from specific sites as a subscription model instead of getting most of their input slop-melanged in through their social media feeds; they don't care about the source of the info, they just want the info. I don't think that's something we fix with improved RSS support; it's a behavior issue looking for a better experience than Facebook, not for everyone to wake up one day and decide to install their own feed reader and stop browsing Facebook or Twitter or even Mastodon for links all day).

reply

As someone who's interested in sustainable open source development, I also find the circumstances around the deprecation to be interesting and worth talking about. The XSLT implementation used by all the browsers is a 25 year old C library whose maintainer recently resigned due to having to constantly deal with security bugs reported by large companies who don't provide any financial contribution or meaningful assistance to the project. It seems like the browser vendors were fine with the status quo of having XSLT support as long as they didn't have to contribute any resources to it. As soon as that free maintenance went away and they were faced with either paying someone to continue maintenance or writing a new XSLT library in a safer language, they weren't willing to pay the market value for what it would cost to do this and decided to drop the feature instead.

But it ultimately doesn't matter either way.  A major selling point/part of the ""contract"" the web platform has with web developers is backwards compatibility.  If you make a web site which only relies on web standards (i.e. not vendor specific features or 3rd party plugins), you can/could expect it to keep working forever.  Browser makers choosing to break that ""contract"" is bad for the internet regardless of how popular XSLT is.Oh, and as the linked article points out, the attack surface concerns are obviously bad faith.

No, this is wrong.Maintaining XSLT support has a cost, both in providing an attack surface and in employee-hours just to keep it around. Suppose it is not used at all, then removing it would be unquestionably good, as cost & attack surface would go down with no downside.  Obviously it's not the case that it has zero usage, so it comes down to a cost-benefit question, which is where popularity comes in.

And no, it really isn't a cost benefit question.  Or if you'd prefer, the _indirect_ costs of breaking backwards compatibility are much higher than the _direct_ cost.  As it stood, as a web developer you only needed to make sure that your code followed standards and it would continue to work.  If the browser makers can decide to depriciate those standards, developers have to instead attempt to divine whether or not the features they want to use will remain popular (or rather, whether browser makers will continue to _think_ they're popular, which is very much not the same thing).

reply

I don't see any evidence supporting your assertion of them acting in bad faith, so I didn't reply to the point. Sandboxes are not perfect, they don't transform insecure code into perfectly secure code. And as I've said, it's not only a security risk, it's also a maintenance cost: maintaining the integration, building the software, and testing it, is not free either.It's fine to disagree on the costs/benefits and where you draw the line on supporting the removal, but fundamentally it's just a cost-benefit question. I don't see anyone at Chrome acting in bad faith with regards to XSLT removal.

If browser makers had simply said that maintaining all the web standards was too much work and they were opting to depreciate parts of it, I'd likely still object but I wouldn't be calling it bad faith.  As it stands however, they and their defenders continue to cite alleged security problems as one of if not the primary reason to remove XSLT.  This alleged security justification is a lie.  We know it's a lie because there exists a trivial way to virtually completely remove the security burden presented by XSLT to browser maintainers without depreciating it, and the chrome team is well aware of this option.  There is no significant difference in security between ""shipping an existing polyfil which implements XSLT from inside the browser's sandbox instead of outside it"" and ""removing all support for XSLT"", so security isn't the reason they're very deliberately choosing the former over the latter.> This seems overly dramatic. It's a small streamlining of an important software, by removing an expensive feature with almost zero usageThis isn't a counter argument, you've just repeated your point that XSLT (allegedly) isn't sufficiently well used to justify maintaining it, ignoring the fact that said tradeoff being made by browser maintainers in the first place is a problem.

The fact that you put ""contract"" in quotes suggests that you know there really is no such thing.Backwards compatibility is a feature. One that needs to be actively valued, developed and maintained. It requires resources. There really is no ""the web platform."" We have web browsers, servers, client devices, telecommunications infrastructure - including routers and data centres, protocols... all produced and maintained by individual parties that are trying to achieve various degrees of interoperability between each other and all of which have their own priorities, values and interests.The fact that the Internet has been able to become what it is, despite the foundational technologies that it was built upon - none of which had anticipated the usage requirements placed on their current versions, really ought to be labelled one of the wonders of the world.I learned to program in the early to mid 1990s.

It's in quotes because people seem keen to remind everyone that there's no legal obligation on the part of the browser makers not to break backwards compatibility.  The reasoning seems to be that if we can't sue google for a given action, that action must be fine and the people objecting to it must be wrong.  I take a rather dim view of this line of reasoning.> The reason we have as much backwards compatibility as we do is largely historical and always driven by business goals and requirements, as dictated by customers.As you yourself pointed out, the web is a giant pile of cobbled together technologies that all seemed like a good idea at the time.  If breaking changes were an option, there is a _long_ list of potential depreciation to pick from which would greatly simplify development of both browsers and websites/apps.  Further, new features/standards would be able to be added with much less care, since if problems were found in those standards they could be removed/reworked.

Comparing absolute usage of an old standard to newer niche features isn't useful. The USB feature is niche, but very useful and helpful for pages setting up a device. I wouldn't expect it to show up on a large percentage of page loads.XSLT was supposed to be a broad standard with applications beyond single setup pages. The fact that those two features are used similarly despite one supposedly being a broad standard and the other being a niche feature that only gets used in unique cases (device setup or debugging) is only supportive of deprecating XSLT, IMO

reply

That's not true for XSLT, except in the super-niche case of formatting RSS prettily via linking to XSLT like a stylesheet, and the intersection of “people who consume RSS” and “people who regularly consume it directly through the browser” has to be vanishingly small.

reply

So, if XSLT sees 10x usage of USB we can consider it a ""niche technology that is 10x useful tan USB"">  The fact that those two features are used similarlyYou mean USB is used on 10x fewer pages than XSLT despite HN telling me every time that it is an absolutely essential technology for PWAs or something.

Removing a feature that is used, while possibly making chrome more ""simple"", also forces all the users of that feature to react to it, lest their efforts are lost to incompatibility. 
There is no way this can not be a political decision, given that either way one side will have to cope with the downsides of whatever is (or isn't) done.PS: I don't know how much the feature is actually used, but my rationale should apply to any X where X is a feature considered to be pruned.

If there isn't enough usage of a feature to justify prioritizing engineering hours to it instead of other features, so it's removed, that's just a regular business-as-usual decision. Nothing ""political"" about it. It's straightforward cost-benefit.However, if the decision is based on factors beyond simple cost-benefit -- maintaining or removing a feature because it makes some influential group happy, because it's part of a larger strategic plan to help or harm something else, then we call that a political decision.That's how the term ""political decision"" in this kind of context is used, what it means.

Then why is Google actively shoving multiple hardware APIs into the browser (against the objection of other vendors) if their usage is 10x less than that of XSLT?They have no trouble finding the resource to develop and maintain those

When you have something that's been around for a long time and still shows virtually no usage, it's fine to pull the plug. It's a kind of evolution. You can kill things that are proven to be unpopular, while building things and giving them the time to see if they become popular.That's what product feature iteration is.

Dropping XSLT is about something different. It's not bad an in an obvious way. It's things like code complexity vs applicability. It's definitely not as clear of an argument to me, and I haven't touched XSLT in the past 20 years of web development, so I am not sure about the trade-offs.

The post also fails to mention that all browsers want to remove XSLT. The topic was brought up in several meetings by Firefox reps. It's not a Google conspiracy.I also see that the site is written in XHTML and think the author must just really love XML, and doesn't realize that most browser maintainers think that XHTML is a mistake and failure. Being strict on input in failing to render anything on an error is antithetical to the ""user agent"" philosophy that says the browser should try to render something useful to the user anyway. Forgiving HTML is just better suited for the messy web. I bet this fuels some of their anger here.

Hey fam. I remember NPAPI. I wrote a very large NPAPI plugin.The problem with NPAPI is that it lets people run arbitrary code as your browser. it was barely sandboxed. At best, it let any plugin do its level best to crash your browser session. At worst, it's a third-party binary blob you can't inspect running in the same thing you use to control your bank account.NPAPI died for a good reason, and it has little to do with someone wanting to control your experience and everything to do with protecting you, the user, from bad actors. I think the author tips their hand a little too far here; the world they're envisioning is one where the elite hackers among us get to keep using the web and everyone else just gets owned by mechanisms they can't understand, and that's fine because it lets us be ""wild"" and ""free"" like we were in the nineties and early aughts again. Coupled with the author's downplaying of the security concerns in the XSLT lib, the author seems comfortable with the notion that security is less important than features, and I think there's a good reason that the major browser creators and maintainers disagree.The author's dream, at the bottom, ""a mesh of building blocks,"" is asking dozens upon dozens upon dozens of independent operators to put binary blobs in your browser outside the security sandbox. We stopped doing that for very, very good reasons.

I think XML has some good features, but in general infatuation with it as either a key representation or key transmission protocol has waned over the years. Everything I see on the wire these days is JSON or some flavor of binary RPC like protobuffer; I hardly ever see XML on the wire anymore.

... Sometimes, at least in humans, social interactions can also increase our irrationality instead. But chimps don't seem to have this problem.

Peter Thiel is the latest investor to sell off Nvidia shares.

According to regulatory filings, the billionaire's hedge fund, Thiel Macro, has offloaded its entire stake in Nvidia. The firm has sold 537,742 shares in its third quarter, which would have been worth around $100 million, according to Reuters estimates.

There are many reasons why investors might decide to sell off their stake in a company, and not all of those reasons are worth giant alarm bells. But it does pique interest when those stakes belong to the world's most valuable company, and the decision comes mere days after another high-profile investor selloff.

Just last week, prominent Japanese investor SoftBank shared that it sold its entire stake in the chipmaker. The firm said that it raked in $5.83 billion from the sale of 32.1 million Nvidia shares in October. The sale was apparently made to fund a multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, on top of the billions the firm has already invested in the tech giant. SoftBank and OpenAI are also partners under the Trump-backed data center build-out plan known as Stargate.

Nvidia is considered the ultimate AI darling. It's a company that hit $5 trillion market value by riding the AI wave, and it holds a central position in the industry as the primary global supplier of highly coveted AI chips. As a result, any perceived distrust in Nvidia's trajectory is taken as a negative sign for the AI industry overall.

It's not entirely certain what Thiel and SoftBank's sell-offs confidently signal about overall investor sentiment regarding artificial intelligence, and whether or not there is indeed an AI bubble, but it sure is adding on top of readily existing worries, and making people feel queasy.

Over the past few months, a growing chorus of experts, from the Bank of England to investor Michael Burry of The Big Short fame, have been warning against an AI bubble that could bring not just the market but possibly the entire American economy down with it if it bursts.

Companies, like Nvidia, have hit record valuations as investors are delighted by the potential gains that AI represents. But some believe that investor appetite is FOMO-driven and could be artificially inflating the actual value of these companies. Even some top tech executives like Sam Altman and Jeff Bezos have admitted to overvaluation. So what happens when that investor appetite just stops?

All eyes are now on Nvidia's earnings report later this week to shed more light on whether the news from the past week is part of a newly forming trend that warrants worry or just a fluke. The tech giant will be reporting third-quarter earnings results after the bell on Wednesday.

SpaceX has fallen behind in developing a crewed lunar lander for NASA's Artemis 3 mission, prompting the agency to reopen the contract to other providers. The added pressure has pushed SpaceX to revise its strategy, but the new approach still appears insufficient to meet NASA's target date, leaked proprietary information suggests.

An internal SpaceX document obtained by Politico lays out a new timeline for the Starship Human Landing System (HLS)—one that would put the Artemis 3 astronauts on the Moon by September 2028 at the earliest. That's more than a year past NASA's mid-2027 target.

Even hitting this revised target will be a tall order given Starship's enormous size, complex design, and the major milestones it has yet to achieve. An anonymous congressional aide told Politico that SpaceX's 2028 objectives are still “very aggressive” given the current state of the rocket's development.

As SpaceX's rivals step forward with their own proposals for the Artemis 3 HLS contract, the company's revised timeline does not bode well for its bid. Gizmodo reached out to SpaceX and NASA but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

NASA tapped SpaceX to provide the first crewed lander for the Artemis program in 2021. To fill that need, the company designed Starship HLS—a modified version of Starship's upper stage designed to deliver astronauts to and from the lunar surface. Its development is intrinsically linked to that of the core Starship system, which hit several snags this year.

The delays elicited concern from industry experts, Congress, and NASA about SpaceX's ability to land astronauts on the Moon by mid-2027. In October, Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy reopened the Artemis 3 contract to other spaceflight companies in an effort to light a fire under SpaceX and investigate alternative options.

So, SpaceX went back to the drawing board. This leaked document offers a first look at the new HLS development schedule. According to Politico, SpaceX plans to incorporate the new dates into an “integrated master schedule” it will give to NASA in December. The company will then work with NASA to update its existing contract and finalize the new schedule.

The document reportedly shows that SpaceX aims to conduct an in-orbit propellant transfer in June 2026. This is an essential milestone for Artemis 3, since Starship will need to refuel in space to reach the Moon.

The next step will be demonstrating an uncrewed lunar landing with the HLS, which SpaceX plans to do in June 2027. That's right around the time NASA had hoped to launch the Artemis 3 mission. If all this goes well, SpaceX could land the Artemis astronauts on the Moon by September 2028, but it's entirely possible that it won't.

Starship has yet to complete a fully successful orbital flight—a prerequisite for orbital propellant transfer. On top of that, SpaceX will face a learning curve with Starship Version 2, the newest and largest iteration of the rocket. SpaceX plans to debut V2—which will serve as the basis of the HLS—in early 2026. Much like the first half of V1's 2025 launch schedule, V2's could get off to an explosive start.

How NASA will receive SpaceX's updated timeline remains to be seen, but this isn't the only contingency it's evaluating. Agency Press Secretary Bethany Stevens previously told Gizmodo that NASA has received plans from both SpaceX and Blue Origin to accelerate HLS production.

Stevens added that once the government reopened, NASA would issue a Request for Information (RFI) to the broader aerospace industry for their proposals. The agency would then assemble a committee of subject matter experts to evaluate each one and select the best path forward.

It's possible that Blue Origin could snag the Artemis 3 contract from SpaceX. The company is developing its own crewed lunar lander, Blue Moon Mark 2 (MK2). NASA has already contracted MK2 for Artemis 5, and although that mission won't launch for another several years, Blue Origin aims to demonstrate an uncrewed version of the lander in January 2026.

New Glenn—the megarocket Blue Origin would use to launch its Moon landers—had a stunning second test flight last week, paving the way for a potential uncrewed lunar landing within the next several months. With the development of Starship HLS delayed even further, Blue is a growing threat to its Artemis 3 contract.

Nature can get downright brutal in the most unexpected ways—especially when parasites are involved. For the well-organized society of ants, some parasites are known to topple the existing social order to enslave their hosts. But new research suggests that this unsettling behavior might not even be the most disturbing thing that parasitic ants are capable of doing.

In a paper published today in Current Biology, researchers captured how a parasitic ant queen essentially tricks worker ants into killing their own queen—their mother. Such instances of matricide—a behavior in which offspring kill or eat their mother—have been observed in nature before. This, however, is the first time that scientists have observed matricide that doesn't benefit the mother nor the offspring but an unrelated, parasitic third party.

A blog post by study lead author and “ardent ant enthusiast” Taku Shimada motivated the study, according to Keizo Takasuka, study senior author and an entomologist at Kyushu University in Japan. Shimada had filmed the parasitic ant species Lasius orientalis inducing matricide in host colonies, Takasuka explained to Gizmodo.

This pattern deviated from previously known forms of parasitism in ant colonies, which typically had the invading queen throttling or beheading the host queen. In the post, Shimada was able to document the moment that L. orientalis, commonly known in Japanese as “bad-smelling ants,” sprayed the queen with some kind of fluid.

“Then the [intruder] quickly fled the premises,” read Shimada's article (translated from Japanese). This was because the “spraying action put the intruder at risk of getting attacked, too, and you can see that some worker ants are biting at the intruder.”

After a few hours of repeating this behavior, the colony dynamics began to shift, Shimada noted. Both queens were surrounded by worker ants—but the workers were chewing away at their own queen while treating the intruder as their leader.

“The workers' attacks grew more violent the more fluid was sprayed on their real queen,” Shimada wrote. “What I found somewhat strange was that the worker ants, who also presumably were sprayed with the fluids, were not attacked. It was only the queen. Could there be some secret hidden in this fluid? To be killed by your own daughters…”

“When I read the blog post, I was so stunned that I was at a loss for words for a while,” Takasuka added.

The new paper serves as a formal description of Shimada's observations, coupled with several long-term experiments replicated by Takasuka and colleagues in the lab. During these tests, the team confirmed that the parasitic species took advantage of ants' particular sensitivity to smells, according to the paper.

The team has yet to chemically verify the fluid composition, although they believe it is likely some form of formic acid. The invader also rubs against host workers to disguise its smell before intrusion, the paper explained, revealing surprising sophistication in the parasites. Overall, this serendipitous discovery was akin to “platinum tickets to worlds no one has seen before,” Takasuka said.

“In temporary social parasites, eliminating the host queen is a crucial task, yet how this occurs is poorly known because it happens underground,” he said. “Life histories are full of astonishing adaptive strategies, most of which remain unknown to us—often because they are physically hard to observe or cannot be grasped from brief glimpses.”

After U.S. customs rules were tightened, hardware buyers are seeing inflated bills.

A PC hobbyist says he was hit with a $684 tariff bill on a $355 shipment of retro computing parts, in what appears to be a growing pattern tied to changes in federal import rules. The case, described in a blog post published November 15 by the writer behind OldVCR, involved a vintage parts order from Germany. UPS, the courier, later reduced the charge after the recipient disputed the tariff classification.

The incident is one of a growing number surfacing online as couriers and customs authorities apply tighter scrutiny to low-value imports. Under rules implemented earlier this year and finalized in late August, the United States has begun phasing out the so-called de minimis exemption that allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter duty-free, even when tariffs otherwise applied. The change was designed to close loopholes used by bulk e-commerce sellers and now affects one-off tech imports from small retailers as well.

According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website, duty-free treatment no longer applies to many low-value imports beginning August 29, 2025, and express carriers are now required to provide full 10-digit Harmonized System (HS) codes and origin data. When that information is missing or incorrect, classification defaults can trigger disproportionately high duties.

In the OldVCR case, UPS reportedly invoiced based on a misclassification. The customer claims UPS assessed tariffs as if the order contained unrelated goods, resulting in a bill almost double the declared value. The charges were lowered after he escalated the issue, but only after receiving automated late notices and payment demands.

 




This isn't the first time hobbyists have been stung by tariff changes. A Business Insider investigation in October detailed cases where hobbyists received duty invoices after delivery, in some cases accompanied by late fees or threats from collections agencies. One buyer told the publication he received a $1,400 tariff bill on a $550 computer kit shipped from overseas.

UPS documentation confirms that duties and clearance-related fees are not included in quoted shipping costs. Instead, these charges are added post-delivery based on customs filings, which are often generated using the shipper's provided data. If that data is incomplete or vague — a feasibly common scenario with shipments of vintage components — misclassification becomes more likely.

Buyers importing retro parts or niche hardware are encouraged to request specific HS codes and verify origin declarations with the seller in advance. Once a shipment has cleared under the wrong category, correction becomes more difficult and expensive.

A vast majority of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experienced at least one objectively-measured sleep disorder, and some of those disorders were significantly associated with greater clinical disease activity.

“Given the high rates of sleep disorders, the significant negative general and RA-specific health effects of sleep disorders, and the existence of treatments that can improve sleep quality, our findings point to a critical need for greater attention to sleep disorders among individuals living with RA,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Patricia Katz, PhD, University of California San Francisco. It was published online on October 24, 2025, in Arthritis Care & Research.

WatchPAT measurements and in-person disease activity assessments were halted due to the COVID pandemic, thus reducing the sample size. Limited follow-ups prevented the analysis of longitudinal associations. The cohort had relatively l ow disease activity and pain, which limited generalizability to more severe RA.

This study was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal, and Skin Diseases.

Researchers at The University of Osaka have engineered a novel technique, Balloon-Assisted Bronchoscope Delivery (BDBD), to guide endoscopes to small, early-stage lung cancers hidden deep within the periphery of the lungs. By using a small balloon to gently widen the airways, this innovative method overcomes the physical limitations of conventional bronchoscopy, promising to revolutionize both the accuracy of early diagnosis and the potential for minimally invasive treatment.

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. While CT scans have improved the detection of small, suspicious lesions in the peripheral lung fields, obtaining a definitive diagnosis requires a tissue biopsy. However, the bronchi-the airways of the lung-become progressively narrower and more complex toward the periphery, making it physically impossible for conventional bronchoscopes to reach these remote targets. Clinicians were often forced to stop several centimeters away, limiting the precision of biopsies and subsequent treatment.

Instead of pursuing thinner endoscopes, the research team adopted a paradigm-shifting approach: widening the airway to create a path. The BDBD method involves advancing a thin catheter with a small balloon to the point where the bronchial pathway narrows. The balloon is gently inflated, dilating the bronchus and allowing the bronchoscope to be advanced further toward the lesion. In a first-in-human clinical trial, the team successfully demonstrated that this technique is both safe and effective, enabling access to lesions smaller than 20 mm.

The BDBD technique offers a major breakthrough by enabling access to the peripheral lung field with minimal burden on the patient through the use of a simple balloon catheter. This enhanced accessibility is expected to dramatically improve the diagnostic accuracy for early-stage lung cancer, allowing for earlier and more effective intervention. Furthermore, it paves the way for future endoscopic therapies, where tumors can be treated in a minimally invasive manner without the need for major surgery.

BDBD is a homegrown Japanese technology developed through industry-academia collaboration. Our study has demonstrated its utility and safety. By allowing us to reach deep into the lungs where we couldn't before, we expect to significantly expand the options for early diagnosis and minimally invasive treatment of lung cancer.""

Vision is one of the most fundamental senses, shaping how we perceive, navigate and interact with the world around us. Yet for more than 12 million Americans living with visual impairments, even small deficits can profoundly impact daily life, limiting independence and overall quality of life.

Researchers have long recognized the potential of visual perceptual learning (VPL) – a process by which the brain improves its ability to detect subtle differences in visual stimuli, such as fine patterns or orientations – to enhance vision. VPL is already being explored in professional contexts such as radiology, where precise detection of faint anomalies in medical images can save lives. However, a significant challenge remains: improvements in visual perception through VPL are typically confined to the exact part of the visual field that is trained, greatly restricting its broader clinical and practical applications.

To address this challenge, Luke Rosedahl, Ph.D., principal investigator, an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering within the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University, and a Sensing Institute (I-SENSE) fellow, has received a $746,998, three-year grant from the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health.

The grant will support his research aimed at uncovering the neural mechanisms that allow VPL to generalize beyond the specific conditions under which it is acquired. Rosedahl's work focuses on how different forms of attention – such as feature-based attention, which focuses on specific characteristics of visual stimuli, and spatial attention, which directs focus to particular locations in the visual field – interact to enable the transfer of visual learning to untrained areas.

This grant represents an incredible opportunity to advance our understanding of how the brain learns to see and how that learning can be made more adaptable. Our ultimate goal is to understand the mechanisms that allow visual perceptual learning to transfer across the visual field. By identifying how attention contributes to this process, we can develop more effective training paradigms for vision rehabilitation and potentially create artificial intelligence systems that mimic the human brain's remarkable ability to adapt and learn from visual experience.""

Luke Rosedahl, Ph.D., member of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute

Rosedahl's project will employ a combination of computational modeling, brain imaging, and neurochemical analysis to study how visual information is reorganized during learning. The research will specifically investigate a technique known as ""double-training,"" in which training on a secondary, seemingly unrelated task at a new visual field location prompts the transfer of previously acquired visual skills to that location. By integrating data from behavioral performance measures, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and changes in neurotransmitter concentrations measured through magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the project aims to develop a unified model of visual processing, VPL and attention.

""We expect this model to not only advance fundamental neuroscience but also serve as a valuable resource for the broader scientific community studying visual learning in real-world scenarios,"" said Rosedahl.

The implications of this research are far-reaching. For individuals with visual impairments, the ability to generalize visual learning across the visual field could dramatically improve the efficiency and effectiveness of rehabilitation programs. For professionals in fields such as radiology, surveillance or any domain that relies on nuanced visual discrimination, these insights could inform advanced training methods that enhance accuracy and performance. Furthermore, the principles uncovered in this research could inspire the design of AI systems that learn and adapt in ways more analogous to the human brain, particularly in tasks requiring sophisticated visual judgment.

Rosedahl's long-term research goal is to understand the interactions between multiple visual processes including category learning, visual perceptual learning, and attention, to optimize both training paradigms and rehabilitation strategies. His work builds on prior findings that VPL is typically highly location-specific, aiming to uncover how combinations of attention mechanisms can overcome this limitation.

Over the next three years, Rosedahl and his team will work to decode the neural processes underlying flexible visual learning, paving the way for more effective interventions for individuals with visual impairments and novel approaches to training in professional fields that demand high-level visual expertise.

""Professor Rosedahl's work addresses a fundamental challenge in vision science with enormous real-world impact,"" said Stella Batalama, Ph.D., dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. ""By uncovering how the brain can generalize visual learning, this research could transform vision rehabilitation and professional training, redefining what is possible for individuals with visual impairments and advancing our understanding of human perception. It also has the potential to inspire innovative approaches to learning and adaptation in both humans and machines.""

...

In a tournament full of sharks, it was the minnow that provided the biggest surprise. After losing their first two FIFA Club World Cup matches by a combined 16-0 score, semi-pro side Auckland City FC drew Boca Juniors 1-1 behind a goal from Christian Gray, who moonlights as a physical education teacher and youth football coach outside his football career. In an exclusive interview, he shares insights from the tournament and the grind of being a semi-professional footballer. 

Lionel Messi. Harry Kane. Erling Haaland. Ousmane Dembele. Vinicius Junior. What do these players all have in common? They're some of the greatest footballers on the planet, and they all scored at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

But out of the 130 players who scored at last summer's tournament, only one was an amateur footballer: Christian Gray. Having injured his groin in his final match in New Zealand before flying across the Pacific, Gray was absent for Auckland City's warmup fixtures and their 10-0 defeat to Bayern Munich in Cincinnati, before coming on for the final quarter-hour of the club's 6-0 demolition to Benfica in Orlando. With Auckland City already eliminated after two matches, manager Paul Posa decided to experiment and give Gray the start on the right side of their central defensive trio in their final group stage match against Boca Juniors.

“It's those small margins, isn't it? It could have easily not happened the way it did, but that just happens to be that the way it worked out,” said Gray in an exclusive Urban Pitch interview.

Boca Juniors knew that they could book their ticket to the Round of 16 with a lopsided victory, and when they opened the scoring within 26 minutes, all signs pointed to yet another beatdown in Nashville. Instead, Auckland held firm and escaped halftime with a 1-0 deficit, before taking the lead after the break as Gray headed home from a corner kick.

Going up against legendary striker Edinson Cavani and other key figures like Carlos Palacios and Miguel Merentiel, Gray held his own with a disciplined display, making 12 clearances and two recoveries, blocking a shot, completing 11 out of 15 passes, and leading Auckland to one of the greatest upsets in the history of the Club World Cup: a 1-1 draw vs. Boca.

While Boca's players have gone back to the glory of playing for one of the most storied clubs in football, Auckland's have returned to their day jobs. For Auckland captain Mario Ilich, that's working as a Coca-Cola sales representative. Goalkeeper Conor Tracey has a supervisory role at a veterinary supply warehouse.

Gray is a physical education teacher and youth football coach, and is currently studying for a graduate diploma to become a fully registered teacher. He started at his school as the football coach three years ago, and started teaching PE this year. His students are between 13 and 18, and topics he teaches include nutrition and exercise, and the importance of getting a good night's sleep.

Born in the Gisborne Region of New Zealand, Gray is the son of Sandra Edge, who won a gold medal in the 1987 World Netball Championships in Glasgow as well as a silver and a bronze medal with New Zealand in the following two editions. His father Rodger Gray captained New Zealand's football team and scored four goals in 39 caps between 1989 and 1997. At the club level, the senior Gray represented Mt Wellington, Waitakere City F.C., and Waitemata FC.

After starting off as a striker, Gray followed in his dad's footsteps and launched his career as a center back. He played for several semi-pro teams across New Zealand incluidng Waitakere United and Eastern Suburbs before eventually joining Auckland City in 2022.

Unlike New Zealand's sole two professional teams, Wellington Phoenix and Auckland FC, who play in Australia's league and are thus banned from competing in Asian and Oceanian competitions, Auckland City have been able to form a domestic and continental dynasty.

Auckland have won 10 New Zealand Football Championships, including last year's edition, as well as 13 OFC Champions League titles, including the last four. As a result of their unrelenting dominance in Oceania's premier football competition, Auckland have competed in more FIFA Club World Cups (12) than any other team in world football, winning the bronze medal in 2014, before losing their next six matches in the competition by a combined 17-3 margin, the last of which being a 6-2 demolition in the rebranded 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup at the hands of Al Ain.

The annual Intercontinental Cup was introduced in order to make way for a revamped, quadrennial FIFA Club World Cup, the inaugural edition being in 2025 in the United States. Instead of just one game, Auckland were going to get the chance to prove themselves in at least three different games in an expanded tournament.

Despite missing quite a few of of their players who were unable to secure annual leave from their jobs, and despite losing to Bayern and Benfica by a combined 16-0 score, they managed to hold their own against one of the biggest teams in world football in Boca and headed home with their heads held high.

“We had an opportunity after the Boca game to mingle with some of their fans, and obviously they're disappointed at the result, but they could appreciate us,” Gray said. “Although they were disappointed, they recognized that we represent the majority of people. We're not normal players, we work 9-5s, and so I think that makes us relatable in that sense, and the Boca fans were cool with us.”

Since that historic stalemate, Auckland have had middling results, currently sitting in sixth place in the New Zealand National League. They've also competed in the 2025 Intercontinental Cup, losing their play-in round match to Pyramids 3-0 in Egypt. With all the different competitions, it's been a busy run of fixtures for Auckland, and for Gray, it's been made even more complicated with his challenging work schedule.

“That's probably the hardest part: outside of training, where do you find the time to go to the gym?” Gray said. “There's times where you don't get the right amount of sleep, because you've got to get out for work in the morning and can't get to the gym as often as you'd like. Any spare time we have, the boys will try to get to the gym, or look after themselves a bit, but I guess that's the reality for us, having to work outside of football.”

Gray wakes up at 5 a.m. before coaching his junior side from 6:30 to 8, followed by teaching physical education and health at Auckland Grammar School and Mt. Roskill Intermediate School. He'll then go to training (three to four times a week) from 5:45 to 8:30 p.m. before returning home. And on the weekends, he'll find the time to squeeze in online lectures as he studies for a graduate diploma. Gray is set to graduate from his one-year program and become a registered teacher in December.

“I think I've always had many different kinds of commitments, I haven't solely focused on playing professionally, or playing football full-time…I've always enjoyed doing different things,” Gray said. “I've got many different passions, and I guess that's maybe a reason for me not solely pursuing football as a career. I've studied a couple different degrees now, and I've been involved coaching junior and youth football for 10 years now.”

As he approaches 29 years of age, Gray has already traveled across the world, gone up against legendary footballers like Cavani, Karim Benzema, and Angel Di Maria, and earned cult hero status thanks to his iconic goal against Boca. But while he's followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a top-quality center back in New Zealand, he hasn't managed to replicate his feat of playing for the New Zealand national team.

He recognizes that, in order to get a chance with the All Whites, Gray would likely have to depart Auckland and make the move to a professional club. Despite being comfortable with his current role at Auckland, where he has emerged as a vital cog in central defense and a regular source of goals, Gray hasn't ruled out challenging himself at the professional level.

“I think I've got a lot left in me, or I'd like to think so, anyway,” Gray said. “I'd like to be able to play as long as possible. I'd like to think I've still got a lot of room to improve, so I'm interested to know how far I could go if I throw everything at it. I've been playing in Auckland and domestically for over the last 10 years, so it'd be cool to experience another competition or football in another part of the world.”

New York Red Bulls goalkeeper Carlos Coronel will depart the club when his contract expires this winter, sources briefed on the situation tell The Athletic.

Talks between the club and Coronel over a new deal did not reach an agreement and the parties will part ways. Coronel is out of contract at the end of December and is eligible for MLS free agency.

Coronel, 28, made 180 appearances for RBNY, an anchor for the club's playoff run to reach MLS Cup last winter, where they fell to the LA Galaxy. He made 31 MLS appearances during the 2025 season.

The Paraguayan international has nine caps for his country, starting the first six matches in World Cup qualifying. Paraguay secured qualification to the 2026 World Cup in September.

The Red Bulls acquired veteran goalkeeper John McCarthy from the LA Galaxy this summer and gave him a new contract. They also have 26-year-old AJ Marcucci in their goalkeeping ranks, as well as highly-rated U.S. youth international Aidan Stokes.

Stokes, 17, was the starter for the United States at the U-17 World Cup this month. Following that tournament, Stokes travelled to RB Leipzig for a training stint.

The Red Bulls finished 10th in the Eastern Conference this season, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2009.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","How will World Cup play-offs be determined?","https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cx278m4gm4xo","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 11:38:03 GMT","

The draw for the World Cup play-offs takes place on Thursday, and the results on Monday and Tuesday are crucial for Wales, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and, potentially, Scotland.

We know eight of the 16 teams who will be in the play-offs, but who fills the remaining places will determine the draw pots - and who gets home advantage in the semi-finals.

The 12 teams who finished runners-up in their group will be seeded into three pots by their world ranking. The fourth pot will contain the four teams who were awarded a play-off through performance in the Uefa Nations League.

Here's how the draw is shaping up, and how the four nations could be affected...

Wales need a victory over North Macedonia to secure a home semi-final in the World Cup play-offs

There are four places to be won, through four play-off paths each containing four teams with one-legged semi-finals and finals.

The draw takes place at 12:00 GMT on Thursday, which will create the individual paths.

In the semi-finals, the seeded teams will be at home: 

Pot 1 v Pot 4

Pot 2 v Pot 3

The home advantage in each of the finals will be determined by draw on Thursday.

So, is being in Pot 1 more favourable than Pot 2? It doesn't make too much difference. 

While Pot 4 has teams who failed to make the top two of their World Cup groups, there are nations within it who will have a higher world ranking that some in Pot 3. 

The other argument is that the teams in Pot 3 have better recent form, so should be seen as stronger opponents.

What's most important is being in Pot 1 or Pot 2, and guaranteeing a home semi-final.



Albania, the Czech Republic, Italy, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Romania, Sweden and Ukraine are definitely in.

Kosovo and Turkey will be in barring huge victories against Switzerland and Spain respectively, while Poland would need the Netherlands to lose heavily to Lithuania to avoid the play-offs.

One of North Macedonia or Wales will feature, and most likely both.

So, what do we know for certain? Not too much yet:

Pot 1: Italy

Pot 2:

Pot 3: Albania, plus Kosovo unless they beat Switzerland by six goals.

Pot 4: Romania, Sweden, Northern Ireland

Turkey and Ukraine are likely to be Pot 1.

Scotland will qualify automatically with a victory over Denmark on Tuesday. If they fail to get the win, they will be in the play-offs.

The Scots cannot be in Pot 1, but are looking good for Pot 2 and that home semi-final.

However, there are two sets of results which would put Scotland in Pot 3 and lead to an away semi-final.

Scenario one:

Scotland lose

Bosnia win in Austria

Wales win at home against North Macedonia

Czech Republic beat Gibraltar

Scenario two: 

Scotland draw

Slovakia win or draw in Germany

Bosnia win in Austria

Wales win at home against North Macedonia

Czech Republic beat Gibraltar

Tears of joy as Irish keep World Cup dream alive

Italy fighting to avoid another 'apocalyptic' World Cup failure

How Haaland fired Norway to the World Cup

Wales are guaranteed at least a play-off, and could technically still qualify automatically if they were to win and Belgium lost at home to Liechtenstein.

Really, it's just a question of which play-off pot they will be in. If they lose or draw at home to North Macedonia, they will be in Pot 4 as a Uefa Nations League group winner.

If Wales win they guaranteed a home semi-final, and likely to be in Pot 2.

There is a small chance of being in Pot 1, but that would require the following set of results:

Slovakia lose or draw in Germany

Bosnia lose or draw in Austria

Scotland lose or draw at home against Denmark

Poland fail to win in Malta

Republic of Ireland's stunning late win in Hungary on Sunday gave them an unlikely play-off route.

It's most probable they will be in Pot 3 for the draw, but there is a chance of being in Pot 2 and getting that home semi-final.

To get into Pot 2, Republic of Ireland need both these results, which aren't beyond the realms of possibility:

Bosnia draw or lose in Austria

North Macedonia win or draw in Wales

As we know for certain that Northern Ireland will be in Pot 4 and away from home in the semi-finals, it's just a question of waiting to see their potential opponents. Only Italy are confirmed as being in Pot 1.

These are the play-offs in March which set out the final two places and don't involve any countries from Europe. The draw also takes place on Thursday.

Six nations will take part, in two paths with a semi-final and a final.

However, world ranking is even more important as the two countries with the best ranking go direct to the final.

Asia: Iraq or United Arab Emirates

Africa: DR Congo

Concacaf: Two places TBC

Conmebol: Bolivia

OFC: New Caledonia

All we know for certain is that Bolivia and New Caledonia will be in the semi-finals. 

The range of world rankings which could take up the two Concacaf slots is from 31 to 126 and who slots into those (the final matches are overnight into Wednesday) will determine the two top seeds.

1:18 PM EST on November 17, 2025

As UEFA qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup come to a close this week, the quality of the automatically qualified teams is high. So far, England and France, two perennial tournament favorites, have won their groups handily—the former allowed zero goals in eight matches, and the latter's only blemish on its record was a draw against Iceland in October—and Portugal and Croatia, two teams with plenty of recent international success, have also secured their spots without need for a playoff triumph. Elsewhere, Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands should seal up qualification in their final group matches later this week. This is all to be expected; you could do worse than those seven sides when trying to figure out who the cream of the European crop is and has been for some time.

However, among all of those traditional titans of the continent, there is a polar bear encroaching on the elites' playground. Thanks to a 4-1 comeback thrashing of Italy on Sunday, Norway has now stomped its way into the 2026 World Cup, its first time getting back to the big show since 1998. Along the way, the Scandinavians racked up a perfect record of dominance: eight matches, eight wins, and a plus-32 goal difference (the highest in the qualifiers, and tied for the highest per-match goal difference ever in European qualifying). Norway can now book their flights to North America with the knowledge that they are one of the scariest teams in the competition.

Admittedly, the Norwegians' group never looked particularly challenging, and at minimum a playoff qualification seemed a certainty. Norway is easily better than Israel (combined scoreline of their two wins: 9-2), Estonia (5-1), and Moldova (a hilarious 16-1). But Italy, oh Italy. The Italians have failed to qualify for the last two World Cups in tragicomic fashion, but this is still Italy, a country with more soccer talent even in its lowest moments than Norway has been able to put together in its most golden of generations. How did that work out for the Italians? After Sunday's ass-kicking, the Azzurri got rocked 7-1 on aggregate across the two matches against Norway. (Italy still has a chance for redemption in the playoffs, but that didn't work out so well for them in either of the last two qualification campaigns.)

This is not to say that Italy choked, though. Norway is good. Very good, even, and not just good in the most obvious areas. Let's get this out of the way: Yes, Erling Haaland is a goalscoring freak, and he has been even more prolific for his home country than he is for Manchester City. Thanks to a brace against Italy, Haaland finishes qualifiers with 16 goals, most of anyone. Second place is a three-way tie between Marko Arnautovic, Harry Kane, and Memphis Depay with ... eight each. Haaland has been as unguardable as ever in the Norwegian kit, making him the key player for his country.

But the thing is, he's not alone—and that is what elevates Norway from a team that could beat anyone to a team that absolutely smoked everyone. Here's a fun stat: Even if you took away all 16 of Haaland's goals in qualifying, Norway would still have won the group and qualified automatically, and its 21 goals from other sources would have been just behind England's 22 in the same number of matches. Maybe even less believable is that Norway would have only dropped two points without Haaland's goals. Of course, it's not that simple; having Haaland in prime goalscoring form bends defenses into his gravity, and his ability to blow open matches makes for easier garbage time goals for his teammates; Wolverhampton's Jorgen Strand Larsen scored in the 92nd minute on Sunday against a completely demoralized Italian side, a state of dejection Haaland had condemned them to with his aforementioned brace. (Larsen's cutback on Gianluca Mancini was pretty sweet, though.)

It's exactly because of all the top-class players around Haaland that Norway's qualifying campaign was little more than a walk in the park. The squad's other superstar, Arsenal's Martin Odegaard, has been dealing with some injuries and didn't play on Sunday, but he's been as wonderful as ever, notching seven assists and a goal in the five qualifiers he's played in this season. Fulham's Sander Berge has been a consistent rock in the midfield, Manchester City's Oscar Bobb has all of the potential in the world and could improve massively by next summer's tournament, and Alexander Sorloth, who plies his trade at Atlético Madrid, is a man-mountain who complements Haaland well. In addition, Antonio Nusa might have been the best non-Haaland player of all of qualifying, so it was fitting that the Leipzig attacker scored the opening goal for Norway in the 63rd minute with a near-post ripper.

¡Se empató el partido! 😎 Golazo de Nusa y todo está igualado en Italia ⚽🔥📲📺¡Disfruta de todos los Qualifiers de UEFA en VIX! 🟠#EliminatoriasEnViX pic.twitter.com/xnZhCqZZub

If Norway has weaknesses, it's in defense, and credit to Italy for exploiting that early on Sunday before the floodgates opened in the other direction. The Italians were the better side in the first half, attacking from outside in against Norway's fullback duo of David Moller Wolfe and Julian Ryerson. Italy's opener was created by a Ryerson error, as he misplayed a cross-field lob directly into the path of Federico Dimarco, and after a nifty bit of short passing in the box, Pio Esposito scored past a frustrated Orjan Nyland:

¡Explota San Siro! 🔥  Italia la hizo chiquita en el área y Pio Esposito anota el gol ⚽😤📲📺¡Disfruta de todos los Qualifiers de UEFA en VIX! 🟠#EliminatoriasEnViX pic.twitter.com/OvlWtUUvQ8

In a way, though, those first half struggles only made Norway's eventual demolition all the more impressive. This side is so good and well-drilled by manager Stale Solbakken that going down a goal seemed to barely phase them. Norway had already topped the group before Sunday in every way but officially—even if Italy had won and leveled the point total at 21, Norway had an overwhelming advantage in the goal-difference tiebreaker—and yet it was clear that the players wanted to finish a perfect campaign. And so, Norway fought back, first slowly and with some first-half hesitation, and then with shock and awe against Italians who frankly had no idea what was happening to them in the second half.

Now Norway can relax knowing that it has achieved something that had eluded it for six qualification campaigns in a row. The World Cup awaits, and Norway will likely be a trendy dark-horse pick. Never mind that many of the dark-horse picks in recent tournaments have gone on to disappoint—who can forget Denmark (oops) and Canada (oops a second time) at the 2022 World Cup?—because this Norway side might just be good enough to be considered a contender with no labels. The defensive issues—to the extent that they exist after giving up just five goals in eight matches of qualifying—might be a worry heading into the tournament, but there's so much attacking and midfield talent here, especially factoring in a fully fit Odegaard, that Norway matches will at the very least be appointment viewing. And with Haaland somehow getting better and better, Norway will have claim to one of the best five or so players in the entire tournament leading its attack. That's usually a recipe for a deep run on its own, but this Norway side is too good in too many areas to reduce this to The Erling Haaland Show. After years in the wilderness, the country will be back on the world stage, and it's bringing a fully loaded arsenal of talented players who will look to cement this as Norway's best team of all time.

Manchester United reportedly rejected the chance to sign Chelsea midfielder Romeo Lavia as part of a proposed swap deal for Alejandro Garnacho during the summer. Despite actively searching for midfield reinforcements, concerns over the Belgian's injury record led the Red Devils to refuse the swap and push ahead with a standalone £40 million sale of the Argentine winger instead.

Manchester United allowed Garnacho to join Chelsea in August after the winger fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim, agreeing a deal worth £40m. However, according to ESPN, Chelsea initially tried to negotiate a player-plus-cash offer involving Romeo Lavia as part of the transfer. The Blues were prepared to reduce the fee if the Red Devils accepted the 21-year-old midfielder in return.

United assessed the offer but ultimately turned it down due to concerns surrounding Lavia's prolonged battle with fitness issues. The Liverpool-target-turned-Chelsea-signing has endured repeated setbacks since arriving at Stamford Bridge, meaning United felt he would not provide the reliable midfield upgrade needed. Instead, they pushed through a straight-cash deal, ensuring they secured a guaranteed return on Garnacho.

The Argentine winger struggled to make an immediate mark at Chelsea despite featuring regularly early in the campaign; however, he has picked up form recently. Meanwhile, Lavia has struggled again with injury and has been limited to minimal minutes since the swap-deal proposal was dismissed. For United, the decision highlighted a preference for avoiding long-term medical risks despite their well-documented midfield weaknesses.

United's refusal to move for Lavia stemmed largely from the club's growing frustration with persistent midfield instability. Senior figures inside Old Trafford recognise the need for a dedicated defensive midfielder who can provide structure, control and reliable availability. Casemiro's age and physical decline have increased the urgency to identify a long-term successor capable of anchoring Amorim's system at a high level.

Without such a figure, United have been forced into makeshift solutions that compromise tactical balance. Bruno Fernandes has dropped deeper to partner Casemiro, reducing his creative influence in attacking zones where he has historically been most impactful. Attempts to integrate younger options have delivered inconsistency, as players continue to adapt to new roles and responsibilities.

In that context, Lavia's profile, a deeper, possession-based midfielder with Premier League experience, naturally held appeal. However, the defining concern for United was his track record of lengthy injury absences, which threatened to leave them no better prepared for the future than before. They require a near-ever-present starter in a demanding role, rather than another medium-term gamble.

Lavia's Chelsea tenure has been dominated by physical setbacks since his £58m ($76m) move from Southampton in 2023. After arriving with huge expectations, he missed large stretches of the season due to a hamstring problem suffered in training, delaying his debut for months. When he did finally make his first appearance, a severe ankle issue soon followed - ending his campaign almost instantly.

Those issues carried into the 2024/25 season, undermining attempts to establish rhythm or earn a consistent place in the squad. Lavia has never completed a full 90-minute match for Chelsea, and his total competitive playing time remains extraordinarily low for a player of his profile and price tag. This season, he was ruled out again after sustaining a quadriceps injury in the Champions League against Qarabag.

His talent, however, remains clear: press-resistant, intelligent, and proactive in defensive duels, with an impressive passing range for a player his age. Chelsea still believe he can grow into a midfield cornerstone once his body stabilises. For now, though, his availability continues to be a major concern.

Manchester United continue to prioritise the recruitment of a specialist holding midfielder who fits both their tactical plan and durability criteria. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba mentioned as potential signings for the summer of 2026.

Chelsea, meanwhile, will hope Lavia's recovery progresses cleanly so that he can contribute meaningfully in the latter stages of the season. The Belgian remains under a long-term contract and still represents a significant part of their project, provided he can stay fit.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","How Arda Guler became Kylian Mbappe's provider-in-chief and the underrated star of Real Madrid's attack","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/arda-guler-kylian-mbappe-provider-in-chief-underrated-star-real-madrid-attack/bltbf4f088476617d09","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

For two seasons, signing Arda Guler looked like it might have been a mistake by Real Madrid. There were, in fact, reports that they really didn't want him in the first place, and that he was instead only brought to Santiago Bernabeu because Barcelona were so keen on signing 'The Turkish Messi' from Fenerbahce. Fast-forward, though, and that assumption now seems massively misguided.

Over the past few months, Guler has become indispensable to Xabi Alonso - and Kylian Mbappe. Rather than producing Messi-esque moments, Guler has taken on a midfield role more akin to his former team-mate and mentor, Mesut Ozil. The results have been extremely positive, as while Mbappe continues to work on his on-field relationships with fellow superstars Vinicius Jr and Jude Bellingham, he has found a player in Guler who can provide him with the final pass and ensure that he at least keeps up his end of the bargain by banging in goal after goal.

When Guler first broke onto the scene as a teenage prodigy in Turkey, it was Barca - along with Arsenal - who were most routinely linked with his signature. The Blaugrana lacked a creative player of his ilk, and there was a feeling in Catalunya that Guler could be developed into a star of the future alongside the club's homegrown talents. 

In early 2023, Barca club president Joan Laporta went on record promising that the deal was all-but done - with the condition that Guler would not arrive until the start of the following campaign. 

“Today [Barca sporting director] Deco was in Istanbul,” said Laporta. ""La Liga allows us to carry out operations for next season without impacting ‘Financial Fair Play'. Arda Guler is a very talented player who Deco likes a lot, and we are trying to close the operation.""

And then Madrid stepped in. Los Blancos insist that they had their eye on Guler for months before Barca made their move, but their Clasico rivals weren't so convinced. Madrid offered an initial €20 million (£17m/$22m), with the promise of another €10m in add-ons, and ensured Guler that he would be given minutes in the first team from day one. Laporta later came out, in very Laporta style, and insisted that it would have been a massive mistake to sign Guler anyway.

""We moved away from the Guler operation because of the magnitude it was reaching. We thought it would be a mistake on our part,"" he said after Madrid announced the teenager's signing. ""There are more players that I think we can get without entering such a bidding war.

""We could have come to compete for Guler, but we decided not to. We have a certain line and we don't cross it. Neither with Arda nor with other players who want to come to Barca.""

When Guler arrived into the Spanish capital, his quality on the ball could not be denied, but there were clearly physical limitations given the stage of his development, and perhaps unsurprisingly he swiftly picked up an injury which forced him to watch from the Bernabeu stands for months before he was eventually handed his debut in January 2024. Even then, though, Carlo Ancelotti seemed unconvinced.

""He did an hour well but obviously he is not at his best physically,"" the then-Madrid boss said. ""The important thing was for him to get used to playing with the team, to show his quality. You have to be patient. He showed the quality he has in the first half. He has personality and character, it's true. That's a good thing. He stands out for the quality he has above all, but character is important to do well at Real Madrid.""

Guler was subsequently made to wait for more opportunities, with Luka Modric preferred to him on a number of occasions while Bellingham thrived in the other advanced midfield role. The Turkey international did score six goals in his final seven La Liga appearances of the season as Ancelotti rotated in a bid to win the Champions League after sealing the league title, but that did little to convince the legendary Italian coach of Guler's capabilities, and he was trusted to start just 18 games across all competitions in 2024-25, averaging just 41 minutes per appearance.

Alonso has, by contrast, had no such reservations and has instead made Guler a crucial part of his set-up from his very first games in charge at the Club World Cup. The ex-Bayer Leverkusen boss brought the playmaker on at half-time in Madrid's opening game against Al-Hilal, and he subsequently remained in the line up for the rest of their run to the semi-finals.

That faith has continued into the 2025-26 campaign, where Guler has started 14 of Madrid's 16 games in all competitions thus far, returning three goals and six assists. When you consider his performances for Turkey in World Cup qualifying, and he has totalled 15 goal contributions in around 1,700 minutes on the pitch.

Within La Liga, Guler's average of 0.91 goal contributions every 90 minutes for Madrid puts him in the 98th percentile within the division, while the 40 chances he has created in all competitions makes him the leader among players in Europe's 'Big Five' leagues.

Alonso has also called on Guler to improve the defensive side of his game, and the numbers suggest he is well on his way to doing so. His 0.74 interceptions per 90 minutes are in the 74th percentile among attacking midfielders, while his tackles won, 1.78, puts him in the 84th percentile. Those numbers are hardly elite, but they aren't bad either - especially for a team that consistently has more of the ball than their opponents and has a real desire to win it back as quickly as possible. 

Perhaps most important for Madrid's chances of success in the coming months, however, is Guler's connection with Mbappe. The Frenchman and Vinicius might profile as a devastating attacking duo, but they are seldom on the same wavelength, and that can lead to promising attacks breaking down when the pair try to combine.

By comparison, Guler and Mbappe have developed far more of a connection. All six of the Turkey midfielder's assists this season have been for Mbappe, and Guler has spoken of how they ""understand each other very well,"" while being compared to another devastating duo of recent Madrid past.

“I like the comparisons between Cristiano Ronaldo and Mesut Ozil and Kylian Mbappe and Arda Guler,"" the 20-year-old said when asked whether he can replicate Ozil, who assisted goals for Ronald on 39 occasions during their time together at the Bernabeu. ""They've achieved great things, but significant success is always achieved by a team, never just two players.""  

Guler's ability to pick a pass has helped Mbappe maintain his central position far more this season, with the Frenchman much more keen to combine with Madrid's No.15 rather than edge away from Guler's position on the right of the midfield three and towards his favoured left-hand side. As such, Alonso's Madrid look much more balanced than they did under Ancelotti last term.

There remain some issues with Guler's presence in the line up, however. Madrid's is a squad stuffed full of Galacticos, and Alonso will need to keep them all happy, something which scattered reports suggest he is struggling to keep on top of.

One such player is Bellingham, who has made a triumphant return to the Madrid XI over the past month after recovering from shoulder surgery. He has slotted into the left No.8 position alongside Guler, but there are question marks whether both can play in the same side, especially if Alonso also deploys a front three ahead of them.

Bellingham is immensely talented on the ball, but can offer a bit more midfield muscle than Guler, who is fleet-footed and more suited to taking on teams in the Spanish top-flight than he is the best Europe has to offer. The pair played alongside one another against Liverpool last time out in the Champions League, for example, with Guler pushed further forward on the right in the absence of an out-and-out winger. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he was very quiet at Anfield, and Alonso must find a way to get his best attacking midfielders into the same system given how much Mbappe enjoys playing ahead of Guler.

One solution that has been put forward is for Guler to eventually drop into a deeper role within the Madrid midfield and become the pass-master that Los Blancos have been crying out for since Toni Kroos' retirement in the summer of 2024. The ex-Germany international, though, isn't convinced.

""I'm happy that he's getting significantly more playing time this year for the first time, because he deserves it based on his footballing ability and he's a lad we can count on in the future,"" Kroos told Sport1. ""But I don't believe in comparisons. Arda is also a different type of player than me. His best position is much more attacking than mine, so it's not about him succeeding me at all.

""I've played alongside him. He has a really delicate touch, which he's already used very effectively for Real this season. That's why I hope he continues to get consistent playing time, because that's the only way to improve. Then I'm sure he can make his mark at Real for many years to come.""

Regardless, Alonso has made it clear that he rates Guler very highly, and as long as he continues to put the ball on a plate for Mbappe, he will have a spot in the Madrid team for a long time. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

F1 fitness myths busted with Alex Albon

The Cooldown Room: F2's Luke Browning takes on a charades challenge

The 2025 F1 ACADEMY series title is set to go right down to the wire in Las Vegas.

It's been a relentless battle from the moment Doriane Pin and Maya Weug hit the track for the season opener in Shanghai, but now one final race will decide it all as their duel for the 2025 F1 ACADEMY title reaches its zenith.

Supported by two of motorsport's most iconic names in Mercedes and Ferrari, neither has escaped the other on track or in the standings.

Initially five points in Pin's favour after Round 1 in Shanghai, Weug staked her claim to P1 for the following two rounds, albeit by the tiny one-point margin post-Miami. Plagued by a technical issue, she found herself resigned to third, a gulf of 20 points splitting the pair.

Although Pin retained the standings lead she's held since Round 4 in Montreal, the French racer has seen her advantage slashed down to nine points heading into the Las Vegas season finale, forcing the title to go down to the wire.

Dubbed the ‘Pocket Rocket' earlier in her career, Pin's nickname has proved apt throughout her journey in the all-female series.

Selected as a Mercedes junior after a success in GT and endurance racing – including becoming the first woman to win the FIA World Endurance Championship's Revelation of the Year Award – she burst onto the scene with a victory on her debut in Jeddah last year. Setting herself up as Abbi Pulling's closest rival for the title, she ultimately had to settle for second, 121 points adrift.

Continuing to drive with PREMA Racing, Pin remained a picture of consistency across this season, extending her streak of scoring points in every race of her F1 ACADEMY career. Three wins in Shanghai, Miami and Montreal alongside four further podiums have boosted the 21-year-old's hopes, but at times the campaign has proved more challenging than expected, the absence of a pole position the only blot on her 2025 record.

As expectation and anticipation rises around Pin, her mentality remains unshakeable as she dreams of bringing home the title to the Silver Arrows.

“We are P1 so we're the ones leading,” said Pin. “We are the ones who have to stay cool and do what we normally do. We don't need to change anything or bring anything. We just have to be fast from Free Practice… and everything will come naturally, so I'm not very worried about that. It's the other ones behind that have to worry!”

Across the paddock, Maya Weug is dogged in her determination to propel the Prancing Horse to glory. Winning the 2020 Girls On Track – Rising Stars shootout and beating Pin in the process, Weug became the first female to join the Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy.

Chosen to represent the Scuderia in F1 ACADEMY, the Dutch racer's debut season saw her become a frequent podium finisher, but she was unable to mount any sort of title challenge – failing to achieve a win until the final race of 2024.

Switching from PREMA to compatriots MP Motorsport, Weug was back with a vengeance, dominating the first Qualifying of the season by almost half a second. Although she lost out to Pin in Race 2 in Shanghai, Weug netted a win on Grand Prix Sunday in Jeddah. However, a technical issue in Montreal led to a disastrous haul of only eight points across three races, compared to Pin's 46, leaving Weug and many fans to contemplate whether her title fight was still on.

Fortunately, her outright speed and impressive overtakes have reignited the battle, with decisive pole positions and Race 2 victories in Zandvoort and Singapore, alongside four reverse grid podiums to the Mercedes driver's one.

“It's been a season of ups and downs,” summarised Weug. “The weekend in Montreal really put us on the back foot for the whole season. It was not what we needed and it has made our lives very difficult.

“We had a mega comeback in Zandvoort and Singapore to get ourselves within nine points. That's something that I think a lot of people wouldn't have expected – not even Doriane! I think from that side we can be very proud of ourselves and we will push until the end to win this title.”

She added: “It's not the best position to be in, but in the end, we are in a strong position. We're coming off a very strong last two races, so we have the momentum. We have the mentality to win. The momentum is the most important – we've been really quick and catching up a lot. We're in a place where we can give it all because there is nothing to lose.”

Entering the final race weekend of their F1 ACADEMY careers on the edge of glory, both Pin and Weug have shown all the attributes of a champion, but only one can write her name into the record books.

“Winning the title would mean a lot,” said Pin. “It would be my first title in single-seaters and it would be the result of the hard work we put in behind the scenes. This project was thanks to Mercedes and Iron Dames – otherwise I wouldn't be here. It would mean a lot for them and for myself. It would be an amazing achievement and great for my career.”

Weug added: “There has been a lot of work going on, a lot of stress and tough moments behind the scenes that not everyone knows of.

“Ferrari, the team, my family and everyone around me who has been supporting me this year really deserve it. I'm super grateful to have them by my side because even in the tough moments, it's important to have those people around you.”

The series' first visit to Las Vegas adds another layer of unpredictability to an already nail-biting weekend. As they force the fight down to a Race 2 showdown on Saturday afternoon, neither driver will be underestimating their rival as they battle it out one final time…

Lily Allen and Dijon are also set to perform on upcoming episodes. 


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Ariana Grande is going for a Saturday Night Live three-peat, with the sketch comedy series announcing Monday (Nov. 17) that she'll soon be returning to 30 Rock for her third time helming an episode.


	Coming just over a year after the Wicked star last hosted SNL, the next Grande-led episode will air Dec. 20. Rather than Grande serving as her own musical guest — which she did the first time she hosted the show in 2016 — Cher will come aboard to perform.

	











	The two weeks immediately preceding Grande's return are also sure to be exciting. Melissa McCarthy is locked in to host the Dec. 6 episode, on which Dijon will appear as music guest, while the following week will see Josh O'Connor taking the lead with Lily Allen — fresh off the release of her acclaimed album West End Girl — performing. The last time the British pop star appeared on the show was in 2007.


	The newly revealed hosts and performers build on an impressive run of guests this season, with Olivia Dean most recently providing music with Glen Powell hosting over the weekend. Before that, Sombr made his musical guest debut on an episode helmed by Nikki Glaser, and Sabrina Carpenter pulled double duty the week before that.


	Grande's third spin hosting SNL mirrors the promotional blitz surrounding the premiere of Wicked last year, with the singer appearing on the show — and delivering some now-iconic modern-day sketches such as the original “Domingo” wedding scene and “Castratti” — shortly before the first film hit theaters. Now, she'll lead the cast on an episode airing almost exactly one month after Wicked: For Good is released worldwide on Nov. 21.

Co-Founder

La Mar Taylor is a founder of the globally culture-defining XO Records and a creative force shaping The Weeknd's global aesthetic. His work with The Weeknd, including his record-breaking After Hours Til Dawn Tour — which hit new heights this year, including six sold-out shows at Toronto's Rogers Centre — cements him as one of the most influential creative directors in music today. His career is multifaceted, from music to fashion, entrepreneurship to mentorship, all with the mentality to keep pushing himself. 

Beyond the arena, Taylor is building the next generation of Canadian talent through HXOUSE, the Toronto creative incubator he co-founded to provide mentorship, studio space and networking opportunities for emerging artists, designers and musicians. Known for his philosophy of “No More Dreams” and a refusal to be boxed in, Taylor has become a powerhouse in music, fashion and film, proving that creativity, vision and persistence can transform both careers and communities. “Tough times create strong individuals,” he says of the Canadian cultural climate while offering advice to the next generation. “Lock in and really hone your craft. Be really f–ing exceptional at it. There's no room to be mediocre — be great.”

La Mar Taylor is the winner of the Billboard Canada 40 Under 40 Visionary Award and will accept the special honour at the Billboard Canada 40 Under 40 celebration at the W Toronto on November 20. Head here for a full interview with Taylor. 

Chief Operating Officer (COO)

Justin Bieber has entered a new chapter of independence — defining his career through ownership, intentional decision-making and a more direct creative and business structure. Widely regarded as one of his generation's most influential artists and cultural figures, he has approached this shift with a renewed sense of authorship, architecting a model that places creativity and long-term vision fully in his hands.

This approach comes into focus through the establishment of The Bieber Family Office, which Justin now uses to take greater control of his creative and business decisions. In 2025, he released his seventh studio album, SWAG — a project he fully owns — which became a global success and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Canadian Albums chart. He continued shaping this new chapter with a multi-million-dollar Coachella 2026 headlining deal secured outside traditional agency channels.

Within this framework, COO Will Bracey works closely with Justin to help guide the systems and strategy behind this era of independence. His focus is on building the operational base that supports Justin's ideas, aligning the Family Office with the values that define it — innovation, excellence, longevity, generosity and a commitment to people. Will's role sits firmly in partnership with Justin's leadership, helping turn vision into day-to-day momentum.

Vice President

Dine Alone Records is one of Canada's most influential indie record labels, and it celebrated its landmark 20th anniversary this year. As vice president of the label, Heather Crane oversees label operations, artist strategy and release planning. It was her own anniversary this year, celebrating 15 years with the label — there for many of the label's biggest years as it transformed from its early days as an outgrowth of St. Catharines, Ontario bands Alexisonfire and City and Colour to now include a large roster from Jimmy Eat World, Purity Ring, The Dirty Nil and many more — not to mention offices in Toronto, L.A. and Nashville. 

advertisement

Dine Alone reports that under Crane's leadership, the label's catalogue has surpassed one billion global streams and achieved a 25% year-over-year increase in streaming revenue, with multiple artists landing placements on Canadian rock and alternative radio charts. She continues to champion independent music while shaping the next chapter of the industry. As many young execs are taking risks and helping shape, she says it's opening the door for creativity outside the major label system. “What motivates me most is the energy and innovation coming from a new generation of artists and executives who are redefining what independent success looks like,” she says.

Head of Music

YouTube's global reach and ability to amplify Canadian artists beyond borders make Gabriel Obadia's role as YouTube Canada's head of music a pivotal one. The 37-year-old Obadia works directly with both major and indie labels to support the growth of homegrown artists, including placements in programs like YouTube's first-ever Well Versed songwriting camp in Canada and a new campaign spotlighting Québecois artist as part of YouTube's 20th anniversary. Obadia is a champion of the global sounds making waves from Canada, including global initiatives for Punjabi pop star Karan Aujla's record-breaking album P-Pop Culture and artists in afrobeats, country and Latin genres. Earlier this year, he played a role in Drake's much-talked-about Iceman livestreams, contributing to strategy and coordination.

advertisement

“What motivates me most about the future of Canada's music industry is the continued growth in diversity of music being created artists here, with the rapid rise of Punjabi, French Canadian, country and afrobeat music and a growing Latin industry, allowing us to continue punching above our weight globally across more genres than ever before,” he says. “Ultimately, the biggest opportunity for young people in the industry is the biggest ability ever to reach fans anywhere they are on the planet, no matter how niche or widely appealing their music may be.”

Senior Vice President

Cody Chapman has helped turn dance music into one of Canada's most powerful global exports. As senior vice president at Wasserman Music, he represents some of the biggest names in electronic music — including Swedish House Mafia, Rezz, Fisher, DJ Snake, Chris Lake and Zeds Dead — while helping define what modern artist development looks like in the genre. A longtime advocate for artist development, he's played a role in taking acts from small club circuits to some of the biggest festival and arena stages in the world.

Recent highlights under his direction include Fisher's 40,000-capacity Out 2 Lunch shows at San Francisco's Moscone Center — the venue's first-ever concert — Swedish House Mafia's debut at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Rezz's record-setting 15,000-capacity Tacoma Dome performance and Zeds Dead's Deadrocks annual drawing more than 30,000 fans. He's also helped create and expand artist-led properties like Abracadabra, Black Book and Niteharts, turning them into touchstones of global dance culture. “Canada's music scene has always been defined by its diversity, and what motivates me most is how global our reach has become,” Chapman says. “Canadian artists are topping genre charts and headlining international events, all while sporting our colors with sincere pride. It feels like that momentum will only continue to grow.”

Vice President, A&R

Matt Sousa has built a career on spotting artists before the rest of the world catches on. The Canadian A&R executive has spent the past decade championing new voices and helping them reach audiences beyond Canada — from working with Jamie Fine, Valley and Sukha to leading Universal Music Canada's first Punjabi signing with thiarajxtt.

Now Vice President of A&R at Warner Music Canada, Sousa is shaping the next wave of breakout acts, working closely with artists like Karan Aujla, Jade LeMac and Crash Adams. His focus is on developing artists with global ambition and giving them the space to build their own creative worlds. “What motivates me the most about the future of Canada's music industry is collaborating with the next wave of undeniable, world-class talent rising from this country,” he says. ""Canada has produced some of the biggest artists in the world, and I believe the next generation of creatives and industry leaders coming up will take Canada's global impact even further.”

Owner & CEO

William Robillard Cole leads the management firm that is taking Canadian dance music to stellar new heights. As founder and CEO of WRC MGMT, he manages Montreal super-producer Kaytranada, whose international footprint has greatly increased over the past year. In addition to his opening slot on The Weeknd's record-breaking After Hours Til Dawn shows in Canada, the producer-DJ has embarked on two arena tours thanks to Cole's partnership with Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino: the Timeless tour in 2024 and a co-headlining tour with Justice this year, reaching a new echelon of representation for Canadian artists in the international dance scene.

WRC continues to grow as a powerhouse, with Kaytranada selling out international tours in America and Europe and its full roster, which includes Lou Phelps, Kitty Ca$h, STWO and Sango, garnering over 1 billion combined streams in the past year. Between collaborations with famed artists like Don Toliver, PinkPantheress and Bryson Tiller and brands like Gucci, Nike and Miu Miu, Cole's company is carving out an increasing international footprint all while championing innovative Canadian talent. “I stay driven in the music industry inspired by helping my amazing clients create lives for themselves from their art,"" he says. “Our company and artists are all close knit, and we all support each other as people, not just industry professionals.”

Chief Operating Officer (COO)

Tamir Schlanger is managing one of the biggest voices in Canadian dance music daily. As COO of WRC MGMT and Kaytranada's day-to-day and tour manager, he is leading the creative production for many of the Montreal super-producer's biggest career milestones yet: opening for The Weeknd's record-breaking stadium shows in Canada this past summer, the Timeless headline tour in 2024 which sold over 250,000 tickets and a current co-headline tour with Justice that has sold out arenas across Canada, the U.S. and Europe. Schlanger is behind the careers of some of Canada's most innovative voices in dance music: WRC's roster currently includes Kaytranada, Sango, Lou Phelps, STWO and Kitty Ca$h. 

advertisement

The Toronto-based manager's priority is championing innovative Canadian talent in an era dominated by algorithms and a lower barrier to entry than ever before. With 1 billion streams between all of its artists and top 10 album entries from Kaytranada on Billboard's Top Dance Albums chart, WRC is actively defining the dance and R&B markets while checking off increasingly big, global feats. “Whether it's the artists topping charts, the producers shaping sounds, or the crews bringing tours to life, you'll almost always find Canadians involved,” he says. “I love that we have a way of finding each other and pushing one another forward no matter where in the world we are.”

Owner

Andrew Pupolin founded Sidestage Presents in 2015, which has brought his influence to many major festivals and events including Montreal's F1 weekend, Calgary Stampede and Ottawa Bluesfest. The 39-year-old has built an internationally-connected company built around Canadian live music and connecting with brands collaborating with international brands like Nike, Adidas, Hennessy and more. Pupolin is a true devotee to the Canadian community, not just through music, but also through philanthropy, offering mentorship and training through Toronto nonprofit initiative The Remix Project. 

He also connects artists with Universities and Colleges throughout Canada through Frosh Week and Homecoming seasons and aligns artists for speaking engagements to students about mental health, anti-bullying and wellness. Sidestage is active in Toronto, putting on 250 shows a year, including recent ones with major hip-hop, R&B and electronic artists like Freddie Gibbs, Lil Simz, Bladee and more. For Pupolin, watching artists increase their draw is a major motivator. “Watching artists and their teams grow from performing for 50 to 100 people to headlining arenas and festivals is exactly why we do what we do,” he says.

Senior Director, Marketing

Adam Armit is an important figure behind one of the most anticipated venues in Canada, the upcoming TD Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario — the expensive reimagining of the city's arena into a premium music-first venue. As the senior director of marketing at Oak View Group Canada, he's directing the brand creation and go-to market strategy for the new arena, which launches on Nov. 21 with a concert by music legend Paul McCartney. The 35-year-old marketing executive moved from Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE) in time for the project, following years working on a marketing and brand portfolio of venues including Coca-Cola Coliseum, BMO Field and Scotiabank Arena — including a viral transformation of the latter into Scotiabank Arena into OVO Arena for a Drake concert last year. 

advertisement

Building his career since he was a teenager, including at his own company Go Live Entertainment, he's developed a multifaceted influence that includes mentorship and development for the music marketing industry, including the next generation. He's the vice president of programming at the Event & Venue Marketing Conference (EVMC) and also a professor at Fanshawe College's Sport & Entertainment Marketing program. Armit sees Canada emerging as one of the top live music and entertainment hubs. “Demand for concerts and major events is stronger than ever, and the investment being made in building and modernizing venues across the country shows real commitment to meeting that momentum,” he says. 

Senior Director, Marketing & International

James Trauzzi works every day to elevate homegrown talent on the world stage.The 39-year-old leads global marketing initiatives and drives international strategy for Universal Music Canada's roster of Canadian artists, championing acts like pop singer Sofia Camara, indie band Valley and country star Josh Ross, all of whom have had major breakout years. Trauzzi oversees marketing initiatives across classics and jazz and South Asian divisions, while also elevating the legacy of iconic Canadian acts like The Tragically Hip and Anne Murray. 

He's worked across both independent and major label sectors, and has seen a little bit of everything. What excites him about Canadian music is that it can't be easily pigeonholed.

“What excites me most about the future of Canada's music industry is our diversity — it's really what defines us as Canadians,” he says.

Label Manager

Justin Clark is a crucial Canadian voice behind one of the most important independent country labels. As Big Loud Records' label manager, the 26-year-old Ottawa-born executive has played a key role in launching one of the year's biggest albums in Canada: Morgan Wallen's chart-topping I'm The Problem. He's also ushering in new talent, helping rising acts like Thelma & James, who earned their first gold record in Canada with the viral “Happy Ever After You” this year. Clark's commitment to his artists' success and connecting them with their fans is making a lasting impact that transcends the Canadian border. 

“From load‑in to label strategy, I've seen local moments become global momentum,” he says. It's been an impressive rise, from becoming one of Cirque Du Soleil's youngest touring members in the company's history (yes, really) to rising through the ranks at Big Loud since joining in 2020.

Agent

Jeremy Giacomin is a busy man. He's personally booked over 800 live performances across Canada in the last 18 months across Canada, the United States, Australia, Asia and Europe. The Paquin Artists Agency agent represents artists such as The Dead South, William Prince, Ocie Elliott and Noah Reid. Giacomin also proudly advocates for Indigenous voices in Canadian music.

Senior Music Manager

Woodrow says the biggest growth opportunity for the Canadian music industry is in payment for creators. “I'd like to see the industry move toward fairer compensation and recognition for artists, especially those whose work shapes our cultural identity,” she says. “Musicians deserve to be paid equitably for their creative contributions, not treated as an afterthought in the value chain. A thriving future for Canadian music depends on ensuring that artistry and sustainability can coexist.”

Founder & CEO

Simon Gebrelul bridges the worlds of music and sports management, overseeing some of the most influential names in both fields. As founder & CEO of Isla Management, Gebrelul, 34, works with some of the world's biggest music producers – including Boi-1da and OZ, both named by Billboard as two of the top producers of the 21st century, shaping the sound of modern music in their work with Drake, Travis Scott and more — plus major artists like R&B star Giveon. He also manages Canadian basketball star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is the reigning MVP of the NBA. Gebrelul started in sports, where he learned the discipline and structure that now shape his approach to artist development and brand strategy for both musicians and athletes — all of which represent a knack for pushing culture in general and working with visionaries who create their own lanes.

Gebrelul encourages young creatives to bet on themselves and take risks, not letting fear get in the way of experimentation. Through Isla, he supports producers and artists who are helping define Canada's next chapter in global music. “I'm motivated by how much talent continues to come out of Canada,” he says. “The producers and artists I work with are helping shape what the next era of music looks like here.”

Head of Music Supervision + Licensing | President

Heather Gardner brings worlds together. She's a bridge between the music industry and film, television and advertising, helping both come together in meaningful ways. As head of music supervision and licensing at Vapor Music Group/Long Division, she's placed music for Netflix's global top 10 hit Bet, Hallmark's Mistletoe Murders, Director X's Robyn Hood and TIFF-premiering films Paying For It, Young Werther and Hell of a Summer. A two-time Canadian Sync Award winner with ten nominations to date, she's helped elevate the visibility of Canadian supervision work on the global stage.

Earlier this year, Gardner was appointed president of the Guild of Music Supervisors, Canada, where she's advancing advocacy and education across the country's screen and music sectors. Music syncs are a major financial and promotional opportunity for artists, which is something she's passionate about showing independent creators. She's also an advocate for bringing humanity to work. “We're seeing this generation in the music industry refusing to accept that ego and bullying are the only ways to get ahead,” she says. “I frequently say that I just want to work with good humans, and I truly believe that there's no excuse in today's industry in being anything else.”

Founder and CEO

Shivam Malhotra has become a central force in taking Punjabi music from Canada to the world while helping redefine how Canadian music, film and technology intersect. As founder and CEO of Malsons Media, he's built a company operating across artist management, original content and investment — giving creators the tools to grow globally without sacrificing creative control. Malhotra, 33, played a pivotal role in the worldwide rise of Brampton-based Punjabi artist Shubh, whose songs have amassed billions of streams and filled arenas from Vancouver to Toronto.

Through Malsons Media, he continues to back artists who are shaping Canada's evolving cultural identity and expanding the country's creative footprint abroad. “I'm endlessly inspired by Canada's artists, collectives and cultural builders and have been lucky enough to watch community-driven creatives grow into industry powerhouses,” he says. “Recognizing and platforming talent, sounds and perspectives early on drives what I do. Spotlighting greatness has always been the goal and Canada has no shortage of it.”

Director - Latin Music

Latin music is one of the fastest growing categories in Canadian music, and when it comes to live music in the country Ricky Taco is the go-to guy. The director of Latin music at Live Nation Canada, a role that was created for him in 2022, the 39-year-old turned a career as an independent promoter and marketer for major artists like J. Balvin, Ozuna, Maluma, Rosalía and more into a major role at the country's biggest live music company. Directing Latin music strategy, he's helped accelerate the explosion of concerts by Latin artists into arenas for superstar artists like Bad Bunny as the genre surges by 48% year over year in streaming and a 2,100% jump in airplay.

advertisement

Taco was also a key force behind the introduction of the new Latin music recording of the year category at the Junos and serves as the committee co-chair for the award. He loves to champion artists who stay authentic to their identity and voice as the demand grows. “I hope to see the Latin music industry continue to evolve beyond genre and language barriers.In Canada,” he says. “My goal is to help build the infrastructure that allows Latin artists to tour nationally, headline major festivals and reach broader audiences.”

Founder & CEO

In a field dominated by a small number of big players, Lucas McCarthy has built one of North America's fastest-growing ticketing and event technology companies out of Calgary, Alberta. A major player in Western Canada and growing across the country, Showpass handles thousands of events per year in several countries, delivering over 20 million tickets per year. “Every roughly 2.5 seconds, we sell a ticket to a Canadian,” the 34-year-old founder and CEO says. 

Built out of simple frustration — long lines and clunky ticketing — the company has become a lifeline for many independent organizers while offering refreshing tools like face-value resale and predictive analytics that make live experiences more transparent and human than some of the more faceless alternatives. “We're watching the old gatekeepers lose their grip and that's exciting,” says McCarthy. “What motivates me is seeing artists, promoters, and fans take back control through technology that actually works for them.”

Manager, Premium Sales - Music & Live Events

Premium experiences are the new frontier of live music, as venues and festivals implement more VIP and member options for fans looking for some extra hospitality at concerts. As the manager of premium sales & marketing at Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, Madeleine Moniz is leading the charge. The 30-year-old executive started at Live Nation, supporting the season seat membership program at RBC Amphitheatre (then Budweiser Stage) until a partnership with MLSE let her move to the Toronto Maple Leafs and Raptors owner, bridging sports and music audiences and memberships. Now, Moniz leads a high-performing team of sales reps selling premium experiences at some of Toronto's biggest venues.

advertisement

A creative force behind projects like the members-only restaurant Lake House at RBC Amphitheatre and the premium program at Toronto's History, Moniz recently helped launch the hospitality experience at the city's largest open-air venue, Rogers Stadium. With a passion for business, culture and community, Moniz is redefining what premium means for live entertainment. “From a live entertainment perspective, we're already seeing it, but [it's important to prioritize] a continued focus toward designing and reimagining venues with music at the forefront – spaces that serve both the artist and the fan,” she says. 

Manager, Marketing

Some of the most exciting music of the past year has been amplified by Vanessa Adams, Sony Music Canada's associate manager of marketing. The 35-year-old creative has led key marketing initiatives for the likes of Doja Cat, Tyler, the Creator and Tyla. In the past year, Adams led the marketing for Aqyila's viral Juno Award–winning single “Bloom” and played a pivotal role in the global rollout Canadian pop star Tate McRae's 2025 album So Close To What, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Canada Albums chart and held the top spot for two weeks. 

A passionate advocate for equity and representation in music, Adams co-created Sony's Listen with Pride campaign, spotlighting artists across the queer community. She says she envisions a mainstream Canadian music industry that fully reflects the voices of young artists and professionals shaping culture — with grassroots movements, particularly within marginalized communities, leading the way. “These creators are not only pushing boundaries but also redefining what Canadian music can be,” she says. “Their contributions deserve recognition and inclusion in the national narrative. By amplifying the breadth of talent and sonic diversity emerging from these spaces, we affirm that Canada is not just a cultural mosaic, it's a sonic one too.”

Director of Marketing and Brand Strategy

Anne Stirk has spent her career redefining how fans connect with artists. As director of marketing & brand strategy at Republic Live, the 39-year-old marketing executive has worked to evolve how festivals can build and sustain fan relationships – connecting live events, digital platforms and the music industry. She helped power flagship festivals Boots & Hearts and All Your Friends Fest to Republic Live's reported 1.7 billion impressions and helped two of RLive's first country management clients, Zach McPhee and Tyler Joe Miller, to CCMA and Juno nominations and top 10 radio singles. 

Her work with Republic follows years at Universal Music Canada and Spotify Canada, where Stirk has led campaigns and partnerships for artists including Drake and The Weeknd while launching initiatives like Spotify's EQUAL Canada and the Indigenous Creator Strategy. Her innovative activations have proven that resonance drives loyalty, not just revenue. It's a mindset that Canada is in a unique position to capitalize on, she says. “We're close enough to the biggest market in the world to learn from it, but small enough to move faster and take real risks,” she explains. “I've seen it again and again: ideas that start here end up shaping how artists connect, how fans engage and how the business grows.”

Editorial Lead

Streaming has defined the way fans listen to music over the last decade, and as editorial lead at Spotify Canada, Kerry Martin ensures that Canadian artists get the spotlight. Martin oversees the country's editorial strategy, spotlighting English and Francophone artists through playlists, campaigns and storytelling that reaches millions of listeners.Over the past year, the 35-year-old has spearheaded Spotify's collaborations with the Canadian Country Music Association (CCMAs), helping establish the Francophone album of the year category, and extended global programs like EQUAL, Radar and Glow to better represent Canadian creators, and will be integral in Spotify's popular Wrapped campaign this year. 

advertisement

From college radio in Halifax to driving national music discovery at Spotify, Martin's career has followed one philosophy: “I'm inspired by how the next generation of Canadian artists are defining their own paths — blending genres, cultures and languages in ways that reflect this country's diversity,” he says. “The future of Canada's music industry lies in amplifying those authentic voices and ensuring they have the platforms to reach the world.”

President

Matt Maw is helping define the future of Indigenous representation in Canada's music industry. As president and lead artist manager at Red Music Rising, he oversees a roster that includes Sebastian Gaskin, Boogey the Beat, Nimkish, Wolf Saga, Drives the Common Man and LOR — artists expanding the reach of Indigenous music across the country and beyond. Over the past year, Gaskin celebrated his first Juno Award win and became the first artist in residence at Massey Hall and Boogey the Beat toured extensively with Snotty Nose Rez Kids.

Maw also collaborates with MusiCounts, the Indigenous Music Office, CARAS, SaskMusic, Manitoba Music and other national organizations to support mentorship and education for emerging Indigenous artists and communities. “My prime motivation is the exponential groundswell of support and attention paid to emerging Indigenous talent in this country,” he says. “We're reclaiming our stories, maintaining autonomy and actively challenging the narrative around what ‘Indigenous music' looks and sounds like in this country.”

Artist & Label Relations Manager

It's been a winding road that has led A. Harmony Harry to her role at Amazon Music — from being a recording artist herself to publishing, print journalism, broadcasting and, for a time, radio DJing as the host of the R&B show Marvin's Room on CBC Music. What's guided her, she says, is her pure love of music. “I'm just a hardcore music nerd at heart and love sharing great songs with people.” Canada has “come of age” over her 15 year career, she says, and “stepped confidently onto the global stage.” She's excited to be part of the next phase. 

advertisement

At 39, Harry leads Canadian strategy for some of Amazon Music's most high-profile initiatives, including Artists to Watch, Breakthrough and On the Record. Over the past year, she has launched multiple diverse flagship playlists, including the South-Asian-focused The Port and served as the Canadian lead on the critically acclaimed I Am: Celine Dion Prime documentary campaign. She's also led marquee campaigns like Amazon Music Originals for Billy Talent and Jamie Fine and an international celebration of D'Angelo's “Brown Sugar” with Dylan Sinclair and Leon Thomas. A connector and mentor, Harmony continues to champion access and representation in music, championing marginalized voices, creating pathways that amplify Canadian artists and strengthening the industry at every level. 

Senior Vice President / Booking Agent

At 39, Joel Baskin books some of Canada's most prominent live tours and festival lineups. After 14 years at The Feldman Agency, the longtime booking agent was promoted to senior vice president – a major leadership role while still under 40. This year, he was instrumental in tours and festival dates for Canadian legends Avril Lavigne and Shania Twain, rock chart mainstays Three Days Grace, homegrown country stars Owen Riegling and Josh Ross, pro wrestling company AEW and much more. He was also the agent for one of the feel-good stories of Canadian music this year, The Beaches' arena tour, which brought the long-running Toronto band to new heights including a recent hometown show at Scotiabank Arena. 

advertisement

Baskin's focus is on creating long-term touring strategies that grow artists' careers throughout the world. “It's great to see so many new managers and artists coming out of Canada and exporting globally,” Baskin says. “The walls here feel less closed-in, and we are seeing more and more success stories with artists playing in Asia, Australia, U.S. and Europe.” The sky is the limit. 

Senior Talent Buyer

At 36, Samantha O'Connor is one of the most prominent independent voices in live hip-hop and R&B in Canada. As the sole talent buyer for RAPSEASON, O'Connor has spent the last four years booking more than 100 shows annually and generating a reported $2 million+ in revenue across touring markets. This year, she moved from INK Entertainment to MRG Live, bringing the entire RAPSEASON brand and show roster with her. With the resources of one of Canada's biggest independent promoters, she plans to grow RAPSEASON — a platform that has already been responsible for shows by Future, Central Cee, Cardi B, Post Malone, Summer Walker, Daniel Caesar and many more. 

advertisement

“I'm endlessly inspired by Canada's artists, collectives and cultural builders and have been lucky enough to watch community-driven creatives grow into industry powerhouses,” she says. “Recognizing and platforming talent, sounds and perspectives early on drives what I do. Spotlighting greatness has always been the goal, and Canada has no shortage of it.”

Associate Director, Creative Executives

Racquel Villagante is shaping how Canadian creators find community and opportunity beyond borders. Based in Los Angeles, the 38-year-old elevates Canadian talent in the U.S. market and leads SOCAN's North American team of creative executives. Across Toronto, Vancouver and L.A,, she connects songwriters and producers to new collaborations through showcases, songwriting camps and international partnerships. 

Her focus is on mentorship and access, helping artists build sustainable creative lives while expanding Canada's cultural footprint across the globe. “The vision of a thriving Canadian music community where creators who pour their time, talent, and skill into their craft can build sustainable livelihoods for themselves and their families is what motivates me,” she says. “The music emerging from Canada today reflects an incredible diversity of cultures, sounds and voices, and it's inspiring to work alongside the gifted creatives who are shaping and celebrating our cultural identity on the world stage.”

Executive Director | Assistant Professor

A champion of equity, research and innovation in Canada's music ecosystem, Dr. Charlie Wall-Andrews bridges academia and industry to create meaningful change. As executive director of the SOCAN Foundation and an assistant professor at Toronto Metropolitan University (recently named one of the world's top music business schools by Billboard) she continues to connect theory to practice. The 39-year-old scholar and industry voice worked with ADVANCE, Canada's Black Music Business Collective and Speaking Non-English on landmark studies on the value of Black music in Canada and the rise of Latin music — the latter of which led ot the Junos' first-ever Latin Music category.

advertisement

Wall-Andrews also partnered with CBC to launch the Reverie Program for Indigenous artists and helped shape the first graduating class of TMU's Professional Music program. “Canada's music industry is entering an inspiring new era,” she says. “It's a vital force for connection, culture and economic growth.”

Program Manager

Julien Boumard Coallier is passionate about supporting music creators in Quebec and across Canada. Through his work at the SOCAN Foundation, the Montreal-based program manager has supported the music organization's musicians, producers and composers, developing programs that bridge opportunity gaps and celebrate diverse talent. Last year, the 37-year-old exec established the Screen Music Lab, a program that elevates emerging Canadian composers and teaches music creators how to write for television and film — a key cross-industry opportunity. He also established a French-language residency for artist-entrepreneurs.

“What excites me most about the future of Canada's music industry is its cultural diversity and artistic excellence — this richness can't be ignored,” he says. “I'm inspired by the growing collaboration across the industry — these creative bridges strengthen our social fabric.”

Director, Communications and Venue Marketing

Tonisha Bath played a critical role in one of the most high-profile venue projects this year: the launch and opening of Toronto's Rogers Stadium, which became the city's biggest music venue and hosted shows by Coldplay, Oasis, Blackpink and more. At Live Nation Canada, the 37-year-old leads nationwide communications and oversees marketing for the company's 11 owned and operated venues across the country – an important growth market for one of Canada's leading live entertainment companies. Growing up in Saudi Arabia and rooted in Toronto, Bath has previously worked at boutique agencies and with the Juno Awards, and has built a career based on enthusiasm, passion, storytelling and connecting audiences through shared experiences. 

advertisement

Bath sees the growth of live music as an opportunity to both export Canadian artists and bring the world to Canada – a story she loves to tell. “Our artists are shaping the sound of music worldwide, and our cities are thriving as major touring and entertainment hubs that bring global audiences home,” she says. 

Licensing & Distribution Operations Coordinator

Karin Visser has an important role within the Canadian industry: ensuring Canada's music creators are paid fairly and efficiently for their work. As licensing & distribution operations coordinator at the Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Agency (CMRRA), the 34-year-old plays a key role in improving royalty distribution systems and strengthening communication between publishers and rightsholders across the country. A trained jazz vocalist who later studied music production, she brings both creative and technical insight to one of the most complex parts of the business — turning artistic output into measurable value.

Visser has also served on the Hamilton Arts Council from 2023 to 2025, supporting community arts programs and local creators. She's motivated by music's ability to connect everyone, she says. “Music doesn't see age, gender or race,” she says. “It's something every Canadian experiences, often without realizing how deeply it connects us. From small towns to global stages, Canadian music…remains one of our strongest cultural bonds.”

Programming Manager

Amanda Ste-Marie started as an intern in radio, rose to program some major radio stations in Montreal and rose through the ranks to become programming manager at Stingray, one of Canada's biggest radio companies. Ste-Marie, 34, leads the curation strategy for the Stingray Music digital platform and app, overseeing global content and creation and making sure playlists reflect the diversity of Canadian music. Listener engagement and market share have grown significantly, while Stingray's social presence has doubled in reach. She's a curator for some major partners, including Air Canada and TikTok, while also conducting artist interviews herself – everyone from major international stars like Hozier to rising Canadian talent like Cameron Whitcomb and Aysanabee. 

advertisement

Beyond her main role at Stingray, she's also a juror for the Polaris Music Prize, the Juno Awards and Canada's Walk of Fame Emerging Artist Program – spotlighting Canadian artists everywhere she can. She says she's impressed by the talent that continues to emerge across the country in every genre, and she loves to be able to amplify it to bigger audiences. “I'm especially inspired by the growing visibility within the Indigenous music scene, which continues to bring powerful new voices to the forefront,” she says.

Music Lead, Global Product Public Policy

While TikTok faces uncertainty in Canada amidst a shutdown order, Erin Lowers continues to make an impact both at home and on the global stage. Since starting in music media, Lowers — also a founding board member of ADVANCE, Canada's Black Music Collective — has dedicated her career to amplifying Canadian artists and building an inclusive and equitable music culture. A passionate advocate for underrepresented talent, Lowers represents artists and TikTok as she works with governments and policy throughout the world. This year, she was part of a meaningful initiative to redirect TikTok's Grammy event resources to FireAid following the L.A. fires that left many in and out of the music industry losing their homes, property and livelihoods. 

advertisement

“We're finally seeing generations come together to exchange the knowledge and experience needed to sustain our music ecosystem, while also striving for much, much more,” she shares. “I'm excited to be part of a collective music community that refuses to be underestimated, and where new paths are being built for thriving music careers.”

Tour Buyer/Promoter

Baldeep Randhawa has been instrumental in bringing South Asian music to global stages. As tour promoter at Live Nation Canada, he has led landmark projects, including the first major arena tour by a Punjabi artist and Diljit Dosanjh's stadium concerts at Vancouver's BC Place and Toronto's Rogers Centre — the largest Punjabi show ever staged outside India. His path has spanned early years booking college shows to a tenure as a talent agent at APA, shaping a career focused on building visibility for South Asian talent. This year, he served as the global promoter for Punjabi- Canadian superstar Karan Aujla, who played massive shows in India and arena shows in Canada and is about to headline influential hip-hop festival Rolling Loud for its first-ever edition in India.

advertisement

At 38, Randhawa continues to expand the global presence of Punjabi music while recognizing its importance in Canada. He worked with CARAS to help establish and chair the South Asian Recording of the Year category at the Juno Awards and launched Breaking Borders, the first international Punjabi music festival, in Malta. “The diversity I see in the music industry now, compared to when I started keeps me optimistic,” he says. “We are expanding our reach to new fans and get to promote genres that were previously seen as unconventional.”

Director, Development & Partnerships

As the director of development & partnerships at MusiCounts — the national music education charity associated with the Juno Awards — Regan Harney increases access to music education for young people across the country. The 35-year-old Harney leads initiatives that strengthen national collaborations, uniting artists, cultural organizations and the non-profit sector. A known relationship-builder, she's brought on new partners and strengthened existing ones, secured funding from all four major financial institutions and gathered stakeholders in nearly every province — leading to a record-breaking $1.1 million dollars for music education programs throughout Canada. That means more access to music for children — something everyone in the music industry can get behind.

advertisement

“The current landscape of the Canadian music industry is really ripe and exciting — there is so much talent at the artist level, strong managers, advocates and innovative ideas,” she says. “What motivates me about the future is that there's a palpable shift happening with my generation rising the ranks and the industry is starting to feel more equitable, fresh and powerful.”

Promoter

Chelsea O'Neill oversees key partnerships and major corporate initiatives that shape Canada's live music landscape. As a promoter, project manager and talent buyer at Live Nation Canada, the 37-year-old drives national booking strategies and leads programming across the company's network of venues and special events. She's managed many big recent projects including two major grand openings for Ontario casinos — the Theatre at Great Canadian Casino Resort Toronto and the Hard Rock Live Ottawa — and the CFL Grey Cup halftime show featuring major American artist MGK. Last year, she booked the first hard ticket performance for Shaboozey at Toronto's Danforth Music Hall last year, where Billboard Canada presented him with a plaque for his historic achievements on the Canadian Hot 100 chart.

advertisement

“Canada consistently produces some of the most talented and hard-working artists in the world, and exceptional industry professionals,” she says. “It's motivating to work alongside such passionate and driven people who continue to elevate Canada's reputation on the world stage.”

Head of Streaming

Julia Amodeo is the head of streaming at 604 Records, effortlessly fostering sustainable, artist-focused growth in today's evolving digital landscape. At 29, she leads the label's global streaming strategy, driving visibility, playlist placements and revenue growth across the label's top artists, including Carly Rae Jepsen, Marianas Trench, Hotel Mira and more. Since starting as the streaming manager in 2023, the Berklee College of Music alum earned a well-deserved promotion and has helped drive 1.2 billion streams over the last year — about a 68% increase, according to the Canadian indie label. 

“I'm inspired by Canada's diverse music scene, which not only enriches our culture but also gives us an edge in emerging markets, regions set to drive the fastest growth in recorded music over the next decade through rapid streaming adoption,” she says. “Because our market is smaller, we have the agility to experiment and innovate, which excites me about the future as we empower our artists and showcase our creativity worldwide.”

Co-founder

Yonis is part of a new generation of leaders proving that culture can drive change as powerfully as policy. As co-founder of Active Cause, he's helping artists, athletes and creatives use their platforms to fund community initiatives and social movements. The organization has partnered across music, sport and fashion to launch creative funds, global summits and projects that channel influence into tangible impact. Grounded in both advocacy and artistry, Yonis' work describes what philanthropy looks like when led by the people who shape culture itself.

He is putting artists first while putting forth the resources they need. He has partnered with Raffa Investment Advisers and Endaoment, connecting artists with funding and charity-related resources. Through collaborations with Toronto artists like SadBoi, Baka Not Nice and Roy Woods for grants and with music platforms like COLORSxSTUDIOS and OnTheRadar for shows and collaborative initiatives around the world, he has created a global legacy for Active Cause in just six months.

“What really drives me right now is watching Canadian artists grow into their global voice,” he says. “The music coming out of this country has always carried something vivid, raw and honest. A kind of emotional intelligence that connects people across borders. Canadians don't just make songs; we make sense of the world. Our Canadian artists are the new cultural ambassadors, and they're doing it through authenticity, not permission.”

Vice President, Digital Strategy & Business Development

Julia Hummel is shaping the next era of artist-first business models in Canada's music industry. After several years in marketing across different sectors, the 36-year-old joined Warner Music Canada in 2014, transforming a lifelong passion into a career. In 2018, she moved to London to join Warner Music's Global Marketing team, helping craft international campaigns and sharpen a global perspective. She later returned to Toronto to help launch Amazon Music Canada and build its local team before rejoining Warner in 2021 to lead the launch of Warner Music Canada's digital strategy division.

This past year, after returning from maternity leave, Hummel drove a new wave of digital growth through innovative strategy and high-impact partnerships with Spotify, Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta and TikTok. What fuels her work is leading a high-performing team and empowering the next generation of industry leaders — guided by her belief that when artists and teams have the right tools, they can thrive both creatively and financially. “The next few years,” she says, “should be about giving artists the tools, partnerships and opportunities to thrive financially while creating their best work.”

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Deadline has learned that Michael Mann has his Public Enemies star Christian Bale circling a major role alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Heat 2. Amazon MGM Studios and United Artists will start production next year on the second installment of Mann's 1995 heist classic. Mann wrote the script based on the New York Times bestseller he authored with Meg Gardiner.


	Amazon had no comment.


	The film is being produced by Mann, Jerry Bruckheimer, Scott Stuber, Nick Nesbitt and executive producers Shane Salerno and Eric Roth.




			Watch on Deadline		







	It was not immediately clear which role Bale will play, but the script has drawn strong interest from top talent. Bale and DiCaprio have each won Oscars, giving Mann a chance to match the high bar he set with the original, which had Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Val Kilmer leading the ensemble.

	











	The 1995 Heat starred Pacino at Detective Vincent Hanna, De Niro as Neil McCauley and Kilmer as Chris Shiherlis. While it was a solid hit, it has since become a crime classic with a global following.


Heat 2 the novel was penned by Mann and Gardiner but is not a novelization of the film; rather, it tells the story of everything that happens to the principal characters before and after the events of the original movie.


	The book, published in 2022, jumps between two time periods. The first following Shiherlis as he tries to evade the LAPD and Hanna following the bank robbery gone bad, and which moves forward into new territory in the tri-border zone and Southeast Asia. The second storyline takes readers back to Chicago in 1988 when McCauley, Shiherlis and their high-line crew are taking scores on the West Coast, the U.S.-Mexico border and in the Windy City. At the same time, Hanna is cutting his teeth as a rising star in the Chicago Police Department chasing an ultraviolent gang of home invaders.


	Bale is repped by WME and can be seen next opposite Jessie Buckley in the Warner Bros pic The Bride.

Anne Rice‘s erotic, Gothic horror novels—full of enticing, dangerous supernatural creatures who grapple with immortality, sexuality, and unfettered power in usually lush atmospheres—seem ripe for onscreen adaptations. And yet, the latest series inspired by her work removes most of the fun aspects usually associated with her oeuvre. AMC's Talamasca: The Secret Order pulls from the titular spy organization Rice referred to in various works. It focuses on a human aptly named Guy (Nicholas Denton)—as if to outright note the show's basic nature—striving to make sense of a strange world as he comes face-to-face with vampires, dungeons, sexy clubs, and death. So why is the six-episode run, which ends November 23, so pale when it should be crackling with energy? 

AMC's Immortal Universe started with a bang in 2022 with Rolin Jones' Interview With The Vampire. Up until then, adapting Rice's novels was a surprisingly tough endeavor, with the 1994 film led by Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and Kirsten Dunst as the only notable exception. (Its standalone 2002 sequel is best left forgotten, along with other projects like Exit To Eden and The Young Messiah.) In the past, Rice was entangled for several years in a rights battle to produce original shows before AMC emerged as the winner in 2020. Its first offering elevated the source material with a distinct take on Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson) and Lestat de Lioncourt's (Sam Reid) titillating, toxic romance. No wonder the cable network bet on its critically acclaimed success, using IWTV as the foundation for its next big franchise after The Walking Dead. Unfortunately, neither follow-up has matched that first show's highs so far. 

Interview With The Vampire‘s two excellent seasons prove that the formula to succeed isn't to simply translate Rice's story, hoping it will flourish in the episodic medium. Instead, Jones uses the book as a bedrock for a trenchant tale about the undead lovers. He achieves this partly by making Louis a Black man (in The Vampire Chronicles, he's a wealthy 18th-century plantation owner) whose experiences in the South in 1910 bring IWTV a fresh cultural and historical poignancy. It's one of the many significant shifts to give the show gravitas and make it a visual treat, whether it takes place in New Orleans, Paris, or Dubai. As IWTV progresses, it raises questions about the other inexplicable entities that populate this world, thus acting as a natural gateway to set up the Immortal Universe, which also includes 2023's Mayfair Witches and Talamasca: The Secret Order. 

Based on the trilogy Lives Of The Mayfair Witches, the Esta Spalding-created, New Orleans-set series premiered months after IWTV. In it, neurosurgeon Rowan Fielding (Alexandra Daddario) learns about her witchy lineage and slowly comes to terms with her own power. Along the way, she battles sinister spirit Lasher (Jack Huston), who has haunted the women in her family for generations due to a curse. As an adaptation, it's mediocre at best, stripping itself of the freakiness that made Rice's writing land—at least until the very end of season two. It's driven by a dull plot and choppy pacing, with little cast chemistry to boot. The show is a stumbling block instead of a worthy expansion, ineffectively connecting the worlds with forgettable crossovers. 

The latest entrant doesn't fare much better. Created by The Blind Side‘s John Lee Hancock, who showruns alongside Mark Lafferty (Halt And Catch Fire), it has the makings of a breezy spy drama. Guy gets recruited by the mysterious Helen (Elizabeth McGovern) to work for Talamasca, a secret society that monitors, researches, and observes all things paranormal. (Side note: Talamasca agents sporadically appear in IWTV and play a crucial role in Mayfair Witches.) Helen views Guy's mind-reading abilities as a potential weapon, while he accepts her offer to find his missing mother. Once he moves to London on a mission, Guy crosses paths with a vengeance-seeking vamp, Jasper (William Fichtner), and questions his loyalties to the organization as everybody hunts for an object—potentially a book—called the 752. Despite engaging performances, the rote narrative doesn't have much urgency or stakes. Chances are you'll end every episode by asking, “Who cares about that damn 752…or anything?” 

It's not that every show of a franchise has to have an equal level of impact. The A.V. Club‘s review of this series even notes that the “mid-tier” Talamasca‘s strength is that it's “quenching the thirst of famished diehards between seasons.” This achievement is limited to guest appearances from IWTV‘s Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian) and Raglan James (Justin Kirk). Beyond that, Talamasca doesn't possess an intriguing structure, characters, or relationships, nor does it properly fill in the blanks of the lore ITWV and MW set up. A similar problem plagued AMC's ongoing TWD franchise. After the original series' massive success, the universe welcomed prequels, an anthology, and several spin-offs. But these lackluster programs were as stale as the zombies, despite being set in different locations and trying to connect timelines. Newer offshoots like Daryl Dixon, Dead City, and The Ones Who Live are particularly egregious, spinning boring yarns with some of TWD‘s beloved faces. 

Pulling off a stable TV franchise isn't easy. Not even bigwigs like the Marvel Cinematic Universe or HBO's Game Of Thrones have accomplished that, as seen with the inconsistency in tones and/or quality of their respective shows. But it's clear that, as TWD finally looks to wind down, AMC's placing all its bets on the Immortal Universe. Producer Mark Johnson confirmed to Entertainment Weekly that the plan is to add at least three or four titles to the mix. Perhaps Talamasca‘s season-one finale (it hasn't been renewed as of this writing), along with The Vampire Lestat in 2026, will help turn the corner for a franchise that, without IWTV, feels a bit lifeless.

A decade and a half ago, Daniel Lopatin shelled out what might be the best hundred bucks he ever spent. On the internet, he'd come across a guy selling bootleg DVD compilations of decades-old TV commercials culled from Saturday-morning cartoons, daytime soaps, and late-night cable: Wrigley's spearmint gum, Hershey's chocolate bars, Heinz Alphagetti. Dated, kitschy stuff, thick with chintzy synths and VHS buzz. For someone like Lopatin, obsessed with the cultural detritus of the late 20th century, this was manna. He snapped up a handful of discs, ripped the audio without so much as watching them, and loaded the choicest bits into his sampler. The results became Replica, a tangled suite of ambient-expressionist fugues—ethereal, elegiac, unsettling—that constitutes one of the finest pieces of electronic music of the new millennium.

The origins of Tranquilizer, Lopatin's new album under his Oneohtrix Point Never alias, are strikingly similar. This time, it's rooted in a set of commercial sample CDs that Lopatin found on the Internet Archive in the early 2020s. He bookmarked the page with the vague intention of using them in a future project; then they disappeared, presumed casualties of a DMCA takedown notice, and he moved on. When the files unexpectedly turned up again, the archive's very impermanence became a newfound part of its appeal. “It occurred to me that even that—the disappearing and resurfacing—was something I wanted to capture,” he said. “I wanted to capture the emotional register of an era where everything is archived but perpetually slipping away.”

This isn't new territory for Lopatin. His 2020 album Magic Oneohtrix Point Never, which was rooted in another audio archive he discovered online, took as its central conceit the “format flips” that occur when radio stations change from, say, golden oldies to commercial country. He framed 2023's Again as a conversation between his contemporary and younger selves, as a way of interrogating the slipperiness of taste and memory. But Tranquilizer feels less explicitly conceptual than either of those albums (to say nothing of the esoteric Age Of or the abrasive Garden of Delete, with its elaborate origin story about humanoid aliens and a made-up “hypergrunge” band, complete with backdated blog posts, fictional Twitter accounts, and other assorted digital marginalia).

Like Replica, the new album swims in uneasy waters—a murky confluence of new-age synths; IMAX-grade bass swells; orphaned snippets of strings, flute, and other acoustic instruments; and juddering, accidental rhythms spawned from clumsily truncated percussive loops. But the provenance of the album's sources is never the principal focus. Sample libraries are overwhelmingly functional tools, often tailored toward specific uses like orchestral film scores or big-room EDM, yet Lopatin appears less interested than usual in investigating the cultural codes inherent in specific eras or subgenres; instead, he seems to be working largely intuitively, motivated by the sheer expressive potential of his sounds. Perhaps as a result, Tranquilizer is the most immediately pleasurable Oneohtrix Point Never album in some time.

The album opens with the sound of wind, followed by faint chimes and the languid strum of 12-string guitar. “For residue,” announces a gurgling, pitched-down voice—the only recognizable words on the album. (I like to think it's Lopatin's celebratory toast to remnants of the past.) Digital pads flare up; a chorus of synthetic voices rises from deep in the mix, accompanied by what might be seagulls, or crying babies. The mood is mysterious, expectant; the arrangement moves like weather, flowing straight into the next track's cottony clouds of tone and flickering, arrhythmic pulses, which give way to a dazzling array of sounds and events—piano, harp, cinematic strings, jingling bells, plucked double bass, creaking doors, and what might be dog barks, or maybe just a bow bouncing against a cello. In the next track, “Lifeworld,” scattered percussion brings to mind infinite monkeys clacking away on infinite typewriters before a colorful surge of easy-listening bliss bursts like a soft-boiled egg—a gooily ecstatic explosion that recalls the beatific swirl of the Avalanches' Since I Left You, rendered in OPN's characteristically chaotic, elusive terms.

It's all too active to be considered ambient, and too erratic to resemble conventional song form, but also catchier than what's typically filed under “experimental.” With rare exceptions, these are not particularly representational sounds, and even when they are, they've been severed from context. They simply wash over you in waves. Something about the music's unpredictability makes it difficult to parse on a conscious level, and the same could be said for its density—the abundance is staggering. There are far more elements in play than you could easily identify or tally, and they are changing all the time, coming and going, sometimes falling into repeating patterns and sometimes simply evaporating. Yet Tranquilizer, in keeping with the chill connotations of its title, rarely feels difficult or daunting or abrasive, and never winkingly clever or self-consciously premeditated. Even at its most unpredictable, it carries you along in its flow. Its arrangements feel musical—that is, speaking fluently, compellingly, in a grammar of tone and pulse—even when you'd be hard pressed to describe any of it in standardized terms of melody, harmony, or rhythm.

Tranquilizer is less melancholy than you might expect from an album inspired by the idea that the cultural objects that represent our past and constitute our identities could disappear without warning. It can be wistful—just consider the limpid pianos of “Cherry Blue,” which feels almost like a Cocteau Twins homage, right down to its title; or the pulsing chimes and distant cries of “Modern Lust,” which cradles a snippet of muted jazz trumpet like some precious cargo—and it can be surprisingly graceful, given the sensory overload of its slow-motion firehose of sounds and stimuli. But in tone and mood, the album stays nimble, at least beneath its generally contemplative umbrella, taking in the sci-fi synth-scapes of “Measuring Ruins,” the Jon Hassell-does-Weather Channel funk of “Fear of Symmetry,” the elastic ambient trance of highlight “D.I.S.”

There's humor here as well, particularly toward the end: “Rodl Glide,” the album's penultimate track, begins with three minutes of ghostly, slow-motion R&B before abruptly unleashing a cascade of garish rave stabs and lush Detroit techno chords—a 90-second detour that may have you wondering if some other artist has hijacked your playlist. It's the rare moment when Lopatin offers us a glimpse of fully formed musical readymades that have come from beyond the limits of his own invented universe. The winking denouement of the closing “Waterfalls” further blurs the line between his world and ours: rushing rainsticks, jazz-fusion soprano sax, Private Music mallet arps, harpsichord, even a burst of tabla. Here at the end of an album ostensibly about the precarity of the cultural commons, Lopatin sounds the opposite of worried. He sounds unburdened. Grabbing hold of what he can, while he can, he sounds like he's having a blast.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Todd Snider, Satirical Folk Singer-Songwriter, Dies at 59","https://pitchfork.com/news/todd-snider-satirical-folk-singer-songwriter-dies-at-59/","Mon, 17 Nov 2025 04:46:20 GMT","

Todd Snider, the longtime Americana singer-songwriter known for his satirical folk songs and empathetic ballads, has died, reports The New York Times. His publicist confirmed that Snider died from pneumonia on Friday, November 14, in Nashville, Tennessee. He was 59.

Last month, Snider canceled his remaining tour dates in support of High, Lonesome, and Then Some, his new album, after sustaining “severe injuries” in an assault outside his Salt Lake City hotel. A statement posted to Snider's Instagram said the musician would be “unable to perform for an undetermined amount of time” and that he was receiving the “needed medical treatment.”

Snider's cheeky lyrics and rustic voice lent his Americana songs a certain air of timelessness. While his biggest hits “Alright Guy” and “Conservative, Christian, Right Wing Republican, Straight, White, American Males” earned him an alternative fanbase, his ear for folk hooks and lyrical details garnered the attention of John Prine and Jimmy Buffett, both of whom took Snider under their wing early on his career. Over the years, numerous artists went on to cover Snider's songs—Loretta Lynn, Billy Joe Shaver, Tom Jones, Mark Chesnutt, Jack Ingram—after being drawn to his storytelling.

Snider considered himself to be the “Nashville antihero.” Although most often heralded for his tongue-in-cheek approach to lyric writing, he was largely the poet of stoners, unconventional artists, and people who opted to take life slowly, telling country tales with a judgement-free approach that felt more at ease than confrontational or intentionally barbed. Over a dozen different studio albums, Snider sang about unlucky adventurers, low-key outlaws, the cyclical nature of substance abuse, and the multilayered depths of grief, beginning with his 1994 debut full-length, Songs for the Daily Planet. Yet onstage, he always found extra space for humor, providing rambling introductions to his songs to make his audiences laugh or lean in closer to hear his words.

“I'm certain I don't have any answers, and I want the people who listen to my songs to know that,” Snider told The New York Times, in 2009. “If someone learns something from me, that would be their fault.”

Born on October 11, 1966, in Portland, Oregon, Todd Daniel Snider Snider ran away at age 16 to visit friends around the country. As he traveled across the United States, he ended up spending a long stretch in Austin, Texas, before relocating to Memphis. It was there that he caught Buffett's attention, played a short stint in his Coral Reefer Band, and was offered a spot on his Margaritaville label come 1993. After releasing three albums—1994's Songs for the Daily Planet, 1996's Step Right Up, and 1998's Viva Satellite—Snider was left stranded when the record label changed owners.

Luckily, Snider had bonded with Prine, one of his musical heroes, who signed him to his label Oh Boy Records. Snider recorded numerous albums on the label, most notably 2002's New Connection and 2004's East Nashville Skyline, and came into his own in the studio setting, calling the shots on his sound, ideas, and delivery with a renewed sense of purpose without sacrificing any of his musical wit. As the album cycles ebbed and flowed, so did Snider's health; by the late 1990s, Snider struggled with drug addiction. He entered rehab in 1997 after taking morphine every day for over a month, and then again in 2003 after getting hooked on OxyContin.

As the years progressed, Snider swung from New Door to Aimless Records and beyond, finding whatever home for his records that he could. As he penned more songs, he also made connections with fellow musicians in the country music scene, with artists like Amanda Shires and Jason Isbell contributing to his albums. Before long, Snider was revered for his live sets—fans often tout his Austin City Limits appearance as their introduction—and his personable authenticity.

Although he stumbled across hard times each decade, Snider never gave up on music as an outlet to sort through his troubles. Back pain and other health issues plagued him in the lead-up to his 2025 tour, but Snider was eager to persevere, trusting in the songs themselves to lighten the load. “I at least want to do it one more time,” he told Rolling Stone. “I told my team that I want this tour to be the funnest one.”

Sonic the Hedgehog is no stranger to reinvention. Sega's blue-quilled mascot has evolved a ton over time, making the leap from 2D to 3D, bouncing between genres, and getting a total aesthetic redesign in the process. But 2008's Sonic Unleashed was a game very literally about change, predicated on the concept of Sonic giving into his feral side by morphing into a monstrous “werehog.”


	The theme song from Sonic Unleashed is still a favorite among fans, who fervently rally its GOAT status online. Titled “Endless Possibility,” the track was originally composed by Sega's Tomoya Ohtani and performed by pop-punk band Bowling for Soup. Now, 17 years later, “Endless Possibility” itself is being reimagined with a newly re-recorded version produced in collaboration between Bowling for Soup, Wheatus (known for 2000's “Teenage Dirtbag“), and the viral cover band Punk Rock Factory.


Rolling Stone has an exclusive premiere of the new rendition of “Endless Possibility,” which features vocals from Bowling for Soup's Jaret Reddick and Rob Felicetti, and Wheatus' Brendan Brown on lead guitar. Listen to the track below.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The cover retains much of the 2000s-era pop-punk energy of the original but is noticeably crunchier and heavier. Rolling Stone spoke with Bowling for Soup frontman, Jaret Reddick, about the making of the song  —  as well as the legacy shared legacy of Sonic the Hedgehog and the band.

	











Did you play a lot of Sonic the Hedgehog games when you were younger?I love the movies because I have a 13-year-old and he's been growing up with these new Jim Carrey movies, and I think they're so great. [I] wasn't a video game kid. I was born in [1972] so, really, I'm an Atari 2600 guy. [But] obviously, I knew who Sonic was. I knew that he was this fast little guy, and I always thought that he was this really interesting character. It's been cool for me to see the resurgence of all of that.

What about the character appeals to you? He's got a bit of a punk attitude.He's a little bit snarky and a little bit funny, and a little bit self-deprecating — but still smart and loving, which I think is very Bowling for Soup. It's like, sure, okay, we're the funny band, but there's some substance there. Sonic has a little substance in his heart as well.


How did you end up working with Punk Rock Factory and Wheatus for the new cover?When I went to Punk Rock Factory, who I thought were the perfect band to do this with, because they've covered so many things in movies and television, but also video games and cartoons — I was like, “Dude, I've got the perfect song for us to do.”


	[This] song has a really serious cult following. There are a lot of people who know Bowling for Soup because of this song, because of this video game. It hasn't been available to them on a widespread scale other than just the random YouTube videos and stuff. The guys just nailed it.


	It sounds like a pop punk song. It's fast, like Sonic. The music really does lend itself to his pace. When I heard the track, I was like, “We're definitely onto something.” Then, well, we've got this show coming up at Wembley and Brendan [Brown] from Wheatus can actually shred on the guitar. So, I'm like, “Let's all three of us be on this song together, and it'll be thing that we can get out before the play the biggest show of Bowling for Soup's career.”


Why is now the right time to bring this song back, 17 years later?First of all, Sonic being around and the movies doing so well is one thing, but also just the nostalgia of our music [and] our genre — what's going on with so many of us having celebrated 20 years of really big records and everybody's back out there on the road. It's just a really good time, both in the nostalgia of both the character [and] our band. It's one of those things where everybody's sort of looking back on that part of their childhood right now, and Sonic is certainly a big part of that.

How does it feel to have a place in the legacy of Sonic through music, and for Sonic to be a part of yours?These are the kind of things [that] don't surprise me. If I get on a TikTok Live or something, you expect people to go, “Oh, ‘Girl All the Bad Guys Want' is the first pop punk song I heard,” or, “'1985' is the first single I ever bought.” Those are all things [where] I'm very lucky, but I can sort of expect to hear. The Sonic thing, it still kind of catches me off guard because it's still so much of, “Please put ‘Endless Possibilities' in your set.”

	It's one of those things where sometimes a song ties to something, and it's just this perfect blend. [For] so many people, this was their intro into the Sonic universe, and this song is a part of that exploration. It's part of his journey in that video game. It's like pop punk kids sitting at Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and listening to Pennywise and Goldfinger. It's the same thing.


Tony Hawk is a good comparison, but it's almost even further here because “Endless Possibilities” wasn't just one of your singles used for a game's soundtrack.A hundred percent. This song was specifically written for that character. I was in his head when I was writing. He is who I represent in the lyrics; we've all got to start from somewhere. For me, possibilities are never ending, and I feel like that's how Sonic is, man. He believes he can do anything. When he gets down on himself, he figures it out. And that's what the song says.

The new horror drama, based on the film series, makes its Los Angeles debut.

Jonas Schwartz


        November 17, 2025    

A spine-tingling house of horrors lurks into the Ahmanson Theatre with the stage adaptation of Paranormal Activity. Based on the successful movie franchise, the eerie ghost tale relies on special effects and mood to make audience members scream, faint, and jump into their partner's lap. Just don't try to follow the plot.

In their rented home in Britain, American expats Lou (Cher Álvarez) and James (Patrick Heusinger) are still recovering from a mysterious ordeal in their last home in Chicago. Lou obsesses over a podcast led by mystical medium Etheline Cotgrave (Kate Fry), desperate to discover why she feels so haunted.

She hears voices, sees objects move, and believes that evil followed them to England. James grapples with the dread that his wife has gone insane, while feeling the burden from his pushy mother (Shannon Cochran) to conceive a grandchild. The pressure between the two hits a boiling point when James sees with his own eyes all the terrors his wife has been witnessing. Now, the couple finds themselves battling pure evil, but leaving the house will save no one. The monsters are not invading the house; they're hounding the couple themselves.

Director Felix Barrett and writer Levi Holloway have devised a crackerjack nightmare for an entire audience to eyewitness. The play starts with Smashing Pumpkins blasting through the Ahmanson (a bit too loudly, so bring ear plugs). The curtain opens to Fly Davis's vast two-story set with doors hiding secrets and lies. Gareth Fry's sound design features banshee shrieks and ominous warnings. Anna Watson's lighting makes a quaint cottage into The Amityville Horror, with smoke, flickering lights, and a window that tracks headlights making spooky visions in the darkest of rooms.

But the main course is the litany of effects by video designer Luke Halls and illusionist Chris Fisher. Without revealing any of the surprises ahead, it can be said that audience members will spend all night wide-eyed awake, desperate to figure out how they possibly saw what they know they saw.

Holloway's script is confounding and one has to just let it wash over them. There are plot holes that the entire house could fall through, and twists that turn other facts into quicksand. Thankfully, one does not go to horror for Shakespearean construction. The storyline is mostly window dressing.

The cast of four are all excellent. Álvarez and Heusinger convey two people too frayed to sleep or even breathe. The horrors engulfing them leave the two beaten and punch-drunk, yet the actors never lose their energy, which keeps them compelling. Fry is delightful as a countryside psychic, one who has seen everything, but still would like a nice cup of tea with her exorcism. Cochran is relatable as the mother from hell, one who knows where that line is, but crosses willfully because she believes every comment in her head warrants being expressed.

Whether at the local cinema or in the packed Ahmanson, there's nothing more enjoyable than a collective audience screaming at the bumps in the night. Horror brings people together in a communal experience, and Paranormal Activity is a roller coaster.

Bitcoin BTC$92,161.96 slumped to a fresh six-month low on Monday, extending its multi-week retreat as crypto sentiment continued to deteriorate.

After a slight rebound from overnight lows, BTC — in what's become a familiar pattern — resumed its decline in the U.S. session,  falling to $92,500, down 2.4% through the past 24 hours and nearly 13% over the past week. The largest crypto now has erased all its 2025 gains and declined 27% from its record high a little more than a month ago. Ether ETH$3,008.16 hovered above $3,000, off 2% in the past 24 hours and 15% over the past week.

The bearish sentiment spilled into crypto-related equities with Coinbase (COIN), Circle (CRCL), Gemini (GEMI) and Galaxy (GLXY) tumbling around 7%. Digital asset treasury-linked companies continued their descent: Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate bitcoin holder, slid 4% to its lowest since October 2024, while ether treasury firms BitMine (BMNR), ETHZilla fell 8% and 14%, respectively. Solana-linked Upexi (UPXI) and Solana Company (HSDT) dropped 10% and 7%, respectively.

Bitcoin miners tied to high-performance computing and AI infrastructure fared better after weeks of drawdowns. Hive Digital (HIVE) jumped 10% on news its HPC subsidiary struck an AI cloud partnership with Dell Technologies. IREN (IREN) and Hut 8 (HUT) also posted modest gains.

Thanks to the government shutdown, there hasn't been much in the way of official economic statistics for weeks, making otherwise little-followed reports grow in importance.

To wit, this morning's New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. That gauge unexpectedly jumped eight points to 18.7, far above analyst forecasts for a decline to 6. The upside surprise is likely to add to the growing case for the Fed to hold interest rates steady at its next meeting in December, rather than cut, as previously expected by markets.

Polymarket traders are now assigning a 55% odds that the federal funds rate will remain unchanged at the December meeting, while the CME FedWatch Tool places the probability of pausing slightly higher at around 60%.

CoinDesk Senior Analyst James Van Straten also pointed to a technical headwind. Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) opened at $93,840 on Sunday, leaving a gap to $91,970 from April still unfilled — a level that may attract short-term downward pressure, as bitcoin frequently revisits such gaps, he noted.

Meanwhile, Bitfinex analysts noted that the pace of realized losses is starting to stabilize, suggesting bitcoin could be approaching a local low for at least for a rebound.

""Across multiple historical cycles, sustainable bottoms have only formed after short-term holders have capitulated into losses and not before,"" the analysts said in a note shared with CoinDesk. ""The market appears to be approaching that threshold once again, with near-term resilience contingent on whether this capitulation phase can exhaust remaining sell-side pressure.""

They added that this is now the third-largest pullback since 2023, and second-largest since the U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs launched, arguing that a local bottom could form ""relatively soon.""

Networking giant Cisco has acquired EzDub, a Y-Combinator-backed consumer startup that provides real-time translation services. Cisco announced the acquisition over the weekend, but the company didn't disclose the size of the deal.

EzDubs was founded by Padmanabhan Krishnamurthy, Amrutavarsh Kinagi, and Kareem Nassar in 2023. Notably, Nassar had previously worked at Cisco's Speech AI group before co-founding the startup. The company raised $4.2 million in seed funding led by Venture Highway, which was founded by Neeraj Arora, who was previously WhatsApp's chief business officer. Other investors in EzDubs include Replit CEO Amjad Masad; Replit President Michele Catasta; Qasar Younis, who is CEO of the autonomous vehicle software company Applied Intuition; and Ben Firshman, CEO of the cloud startup Replicate (which was itself acquired by Cloudflare in a deal that was announced on Monday).

Cisco said it plans to integrate EzDubs' tech into its communication platform, Cisco Collaboration, which spans hardware and software. This means users can get features like live translation in products like Webex video calling and messaging. Cisco's blog post also indicated that it could make the translation tech — which preserves the speaker's original voice — available to partners and developers.

“The EzDubs team will join Cisco Collaboration, working side-by-side with our product, engineering, and go-to-market teams. Together, we will chart a new course for the industry, one where AI doesn't just support collaboration, but truly empowers it,” Snorre Kjesbu, SVP of Collaboration at Cisco, said in the post. 

Cisco didn't clarify whether all members of EzDubs' team are joining the company. We have asked the company to clarify and will update the story if we hear back.

EzDubs is sunsetting its consumer apps, which supported call translations for more than 30 languages, by December 15. 

“From launching the world's first video dubbing tool that garnered millions of views on X (fka Twitter) to enabling real-time, voice and emotion preserving phone call translation across 30+ languages, this journey has been extraordinary. But what has truly meant the most is the support, feedback, and stories you've shared along the way,” the startup said in a blog post. 

In recent months, there have been a few acquisitions in the translation space. This month, Seven Seven Six-backed Palabra AI acquired live communication platform Talo. In July, language localization company TransPerfect acquired Unbabel, a translation startup founded in Portugal. 

EzDubs' acquisition also raises the question of whether it's viable to build a translation focused on consumers when there is more money and demand in the enterprise communication market. According to various reports, the translation services market is valued at approximately $40 billion.

Oxytocin administration, when combined with instructed positive interaction with a partner and physical intimacy, improved wound healing in couples in a randomized trial.

“When combined with the PAT…or with everyday intimacy (with more robust effects), oxytocin was associated with faster recovery,” the authors wrote. “These modest, context-dependent effects provide preliminary insights into the neuroendocrine mechanisms through which intimate relationships can improve health, underscoring the need for larger, more diverse trials,” they noted, adding that the data “support the view that oxytocin functions as a social amplifier rather than a standalone therapeutic.”

The study was led by Ekaterina Schneider, PhD, Institute of Medical Psychology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, and was published online on November 12 in JAMA Psychiatry.

Wound healing assessment was limited to only 24 hours and 7 days post-wounding; the PAT had incomplete adherence at 68% and lacked standardized timing. The study population was restricted to young, healthy, heterosexual couples, limiting generalizability to other demographics. Additionally, the beliefs about group assignment were only indirectly assessed, and intimacy measures lacked standardized definitions.

The study was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

In a population-based study, the progression of disease after first-line therapy was associated with a more than sevenfold increased risk for mortality in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and progression occurring after 6 years was associated with a more than twofold higher risk for mortality than no progression.

""This study underscores the strong negative impact of progression on overall survival in MCL, demonstrating that all events of disease progression — even those occurring up to 10 years post treatment — are associated with inferior survival,"" the authors wrote, adding that ""efforts should focus not only on prolonging remission durations but also on avoiding progression/relapse altogether.""

This study was led by Sara Ekberg, Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. It was published online on November 05, 2025, in the International Journal of Cancer.

This study lacked information on specific molecular markers such as TP53 mutation or p53 status, histologic subtype, and Ki-67, limiting the ability to fully characterise the genetic heterogeneity of MCL and its influence on disease progression. Additionally, detailed information on relapse treatments, including Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy brexucel, was limited during the study period.

This study was funded by a grant from the Swedish Cancer Society and Åke Wiberg Foundation. One author reported receiving research support to the department from Takeda and educational boards with finance to the department from Janssen Cilag, AbbVie, and Kite/Gilead. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

Elinzanetant improves sleep disturbances independent of improvements in vasomotor symptoms, according to data presented at The Menopause Society 2025 Annual Meeting.

Elinzanetant is a nonhormonal drug that the US Food and Drug Administration approved October 24 to treat hot flashes and night sweats. Data from 1898 women enrolled in the four randomized controlled OASIS trials showed that elinzanetant reduced the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms not only in postmenopausal middle-aged women but also, in one trial, in women aged 18-70 who had HR+ breast cancer, were receiving endocrine therapy, and were experiencing at least 35 moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms per week. 

""These findings highlight the potential for elinzanetant to improve sleep through mechanisms beyond vasomotor symptom alleviation and support the notion that sleep disturbances in menopause are not solely caused by vasomotor symptoms,"" Pauline Maki, PhD, told attendees. ""Further research is warranted to elucidate the pathways through which elinzanetant exerts its direct effects on sleep."" 

Maki, a professor of psychiatry, psychology, and obstetrics & gynecology at the University of Illinois in Chicago, presented pooled data from 1345 women enrolled across three phase 3 trials and one phase 2 trial that compared 120 mg of elinzanetant to placebo over 12 weeks. Two of the phase 3 trials, OASIS-1 and OASIS-2, included postmenopausal women who reported at least 50 vasomotor symptoms per week. OASIS-3 included postmenopausal women who reported any bothersome vasomotor symptoms, regardless of frequency. While none of these trials required participants to report sleep disturbances, the phase 2 NIRVANA trial included postmenopausal women with at least 20 vasomotor symptoms per week as well as sleep disturbances. 

Combining participants across the four trials, 668 women received 120 mg of elinzanetant and 677 women received placebo. All women documented their vasomotor symptoms twice a day and completed the PROMIS SD-SF-8b sleep assessment at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12. Researchers used a longitudinal causal mediation analysis to understand the total treatment effect and the effect on sleep independent of reduction in nighttime vasomotor symptoms.

At baseline, women reported an average of 4.8 moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms at night and their sleep score averaged 59.6. Overall, women receiving elinzanetant experienced a 4.9-point improvement in their sleep scores compared to those receiving placebo. When taking into account changes due to vasomotor symptoms, however, researchers calculated that 2.25 of those points were due to improvements in symptoms while 2.67 points occurred directly because of elinzanetant separate from improvements in night sweats.

Overall, researchers calculated that 54.3% of the improvement in sleep disturbances was directly due to elinzanetant even without vasomotor symptom improvements. 

""It's very exciting to have another option for people who either don't want to be on hormone therapy or have a contraindication to being on hormone therapy,"" Monica Christmas, MD, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology and director of the Menopause Program at the University of Chicago Medicine, told Medscape Medical News. Christmas, who is also associate medical director for The Menopause Society, was not involved in any of the elinzanetant clinical trials, and said the recent approval of the drug was ""huge"" in providing women with more choices. 

""One of the nice things about this is that sleep was improved even outside of correcting for vasomotor symptoms,"" Christmas said. She found the safety profile of elinzanetant reassuring as well. 

Another important thing about this, Christmas said, ""is that they didn't show in their safety data that there were the same hepatic concerns"" as those seen with fezolinetant, the only other approved nonhormonal drug in the same class as elinzanetant. Both drugs are neurokinin-targeted therapies, with fezolinetant targeting the NK-3 receptor and elinzanetant targeting the NK-3 and NK-1 receptors in the brain.

With fezolinetant, you have to check a woman's liver function at baseline, then every month for the first 3 months, and then every 3 months for the rest of the year, Christmas explained. ""With elinzanetant, because they didn't show the same liver concerns, the recommendation is just to check liver function at baseline and at 3 months,"" she added. Mild elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase are not necessarily contraindications, Christmas noted. If there are no changes at 3 months, there is no indication for further testing.

Adding to the safety profile, ""this one was also studied in women with a history of breast cancer,"" unlike fezolinetant, Christmas added.

The research was funded by Bayer. Maki has received personal fees from Astellas, Bayer, and Pfizer, and holds equity in Respin, Midi Health, and Estrigenix. Christmas has given lectures for FertilityIQ and had no other disclosures.

HELSINKI – The large language model (LLM) Gemini 1.0 produced the highest-quality health information on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) when compared with leading LLMs, including ChatGPT-3.5 and 4.0 and Claude 2.0, according to new research presented at the 18th European Public Health Conference.

“Data suggest that Gemini's design prioritises user safety and accessibility, reflecting a deliberate balance between information and caution, a trait especially relevant for health communication,” said Marcello Di Pumpo, MD, public health medical doctor and adjunct professor at Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (UNICATT) in Milan.

Di Pumpo highlighted the urgency of the global AMR threat and the growing trend of the public seeking health information from commercial artificial intelligence (AI) tools. “Understanding whether these models can communicate appropriately about AMR, without spreading misinformation or overconfidence, is therefore essential.”

Gemini 1.0, despite self-inhibiting after only five prompts, delivered the most readable, context-sensitive, and lexically rich content. “Its self-inhibition with the words, ‘I am only a chatbot, please refer to experts,' highlights an emerging ethical safeguard, where the model avoids risky or inappropriate advice,” explained Di Pumpo.

However, he stressed that all LLM-generated health information requires expert review. “While LLMs are promising tools, these are not magical tools that will always provide good answers. Expert supervision and referral to a medical expert are strongly suggested.”

The public health implications of the widespread use of LLMs remain largely unknown. This study evaluated whether AI systems can support safe antimicrobial use by providing reliable and accessible information to general users.

Three commercially available LLMs were assessed — ChatGPT-3.5 and 4.0, Claude 2.0, and Gemini 1.0 — with performance compared across content quality, accessibility, and contextual awareness. Each model was prompted with questions typical of nonexpert users. 

“The rise of AI, in particular large language models, has begun to transform health communication. Because these systems provide personalised, 24/7 health information, they have great potential for behaviour change,” said Di Pumpo.

“Early studies have shown the promise of LLMs in delivering health information and engaging users in preventative practices. However, their growing popularity, accuracy, readability, and other characteristics need evaluation by experts,” he added.

The study used two analytic approaches. Computational text analysis measured word count, readability, lexical diversity, and sentiment. Clinical experts then rated responses using an adapted DISCERN tool, reviewing reliability, AMR-specific awareness, persuasiveness, and overall quality. 

All models showed overly positive tones which, while reassuring, may mask nuance or risk in clinical settings, Di Pumpo reported.

Gemini performed best overall. “Not only did it produce the longest response and the highest lexical diversity, but it also had the most positive tone in answers.” By comparison, Claude produced more polarized responses, either very negative or very positive, suggesting greaterinstability in tone than the other LLMs, he added.

ChatGPT-3.5 performed the weakest, as expected given its earlier architecture, while ChatGPT-4.0 showed improvements in response length and elaboration, with more complete answers but still only moderate readability. Claude 2.0 sometimes produced responses that were overly short or overly verbose, and either very positive or neutral in tone.

The weakest performance across all models was in AMR-specific content. “The AMR domain scored the lowest, indicating a persistent weakness in discussing antimicrobial resistance issues [upon comparison with experts],” said Di Pumpo. “Gemini performed best, while the older ChatGPT performed worst. You can see a stark difference… a gradient from Gemini to the others, especially with the earlier version of ChatGPT lagging behind.”

None of the models generated easy-to-read outputs; readability corresponded to a high-school education level, limiting accessibility for low-literacy groups. In addition, the language reflected bias towards English-language training data.

LLMs can transform health communication, said Di Pumpo, but he stressed the need for “expert oversight because the public health implications of the information provided by LLMs remain largely unassessed by scientific experts.”

In a secondary analysis not presented during the session but shared with Medscape News Europe in an interview, Di Pumpo noted that LLMs might “help family doctors enhance their communication skills around AMR with patients. They might even want to triangulate the patient conversation with the chatbot, especially if voice-enabled, for common use cases, but not for sensitive situations.”

Session moderator Anjum Memon, PhD, professor of epidemiology and Public Health Medicine at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, UK, commented on the results. 

“These tools are very useful in empowering patients with knowledge about AMR and for more self-care, but they shouldn't be relied on fully or encourage self-treating. A family physician should always be consulted.”

The results have also been published in BMJ Health & Care Informatics.

Neither Di Pumpo nor Memon reported any relevant disclosures. ","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

B
ack in August, Billy Bob Thornton turned 70. It's easy to imagine him celebrating a landmark birthday with some sort of blowout party during a more chaotic period of his life, say about two decades back. But this was a quiet affair with his children and wife, Connie Angland.


	“Connie asked me what I wanted and I said, ‘Nothing, absolutely nothing. As a matter of fact, don't mention it to anybody,'” Thornton tells Rolling Stone. “We really just hung out here at the house, just me and Connie and the kids, and had a nice time, and they got me a vegan cake, which — I can't eat wheat or dairy, so that was awesome. Anytime a guy like me could have cake, it's a great day.”


	This is a good time in time in Thornton's life. He's finally in a long, stable marriage after five prior attempts, and his show Landman is a giant hit for Paramount+. (The second season kicked off over the weekend.) We spoke to Thornton about the series, the odd trajectory of his career over the past few decades, his other life as a musician, his greatest vice, what the public got wrong about him and Angelina Jolie, and why he never says no to a selfie.

	











In Landman, you play Tommy Norris, a deeply stressed-out dealmaker for an oil company. Do you relate to him in any way?I've spent periods in my life where I had the weight of the world on my shoulders, so I think that's probably a thing I relate to the most. Our work ethic is pretty close. Plus I grew up down in Arkansas and Texas, so I know those [oil] guys and grew up around it.

	











	Probably the biggest difference in me and Tommy and in real life is that the way I dress is the polar opposite. The only cowboy hat I wrote prior to this was a rock & roll cowboy hat bent in front and the back with a bandana underneath it. And I'd never worn a white snap button Western shirt until this. 


In two key scenes in the first season, Tommy negotiates with drug dealers while tied to a chair with a burlap sack over his head. How do you think you'd handle that situation in real life?Well, I'll tell you what, I've been closer to that in my real life than I have been running an oil company, for sure. I've probably felt more at home there with the bag on my head with a bunch of drug dealers than going out there and talking about pump jacks.

Taylor Sheridan seems to have a real intuitive sense of what it takes to make a hit TV show. What does he understand about the medium?Well, I think he knows that there are people, particularly in the U.S., that are begging to see themselves onscreen. There's a lot [of people] in today's society who think there's so many rules and laws, and that politics is crazy on every side. I think he's found a way to appeal to people somewhere in the middle.He also writes stories that make you want to see what's going to happen next. People by nature want that. It's why people watched soap operas in the Fifties and Sixties and Seventies. They want to know if Muffy's going to marry Biff or whatever. 


He took Kevin Costner, Harrison Ford, Sylvester Stallone, and you, and gave you such juicy characters to play at a time when movie studios are not making the types of movies that you guys used to make back in the day.That's very true. But also everybody's found this streaming world, which is what people are into now. I was late to the party because when I was growing up TV was a bad word to movie actors. So I resisted forever. I was offered two or three series that became huge hits in the 2000s, and I turned them down. My manager kept telling me, “Dude, this is where it's headed. You don't understand.” I said, “Well, I know, but it's TV.” He said, “It's not. These are long-form movies and it's where the future is.” The first [TV] thing I did was the first season of Fargo, and once I did Fargo, I said, “Oh, OK, I get it. I totally understand now.”

My mother used to see one movie a week in the theater. She goes maybe twice a year now.You know what I go to see in the theater? I go see Moana and Inside Out with my daughter. That's the only time I've been in the theater in the last two or three years, watching those movies that my daughter wants to go see.


If you were trying to get Sling Blade made now, do you think it would happen?I don't think I could get Sling Blade made now. I don't think we would get Bad Santa made now. There's a possibility we wouldn't get Monster's Ball made now. As a matter of fact, a lot of movies I've done, I don't think you could get them made now. Sling Blade, even if it did get made now, it would be cast away to some cable channel in the middle of the night or something like that.

	











You got very famous in your forties as opposed to your twenties like a lot of actors. Do you think fame is easier to navigate when you're a bit older and more experienced in life?Oh, for sure. There's no doubt about it. I kiss the ground every day and count my lucky stars that that didn't happen, because in my twenties I'm a skinny little long-haired hippie doing, as Frank Zappa said, chemical refreshments, and no idea other than I live for today. There's no telling what would've happened to me if I'd have become famous in my twenties. I probably wouldn't be here, honestly.


After Sling Blade, which won you a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar, you got so many opportunities all at once. Was that overwhelming?Yeah. It all happened so quickly. But Robert Redford gave me some good advice. He said, “Now they're going to offer you to write big movies about an alien who lands in Kansas or whatever it is.” And he said, “Just don't do it. Stay right where you are in this independent film world. Make a name for yourself in that, and then go to the bigger movies.” He was absolutely right. And I'll never forget that. He was right on the money.


What's the best advice you've ever received?I was working for a catering company and I met Billy Wilder. I was at this party with a bunch of rich people, passing out hors d'oeuvres, and he said, “So you want to be an actor?” And I said, “How did you know that?” Because I wasn't clued into the fact that all the waiters in L.A. want to be actors. And he said, “Forget about it. You're too ugly to be a leading man, and you're too pretty to be a character actor.” And I said, “So what do I do?” He said, “Can you write?” I said, “Yeah, I actually do write. I write songs. I write short stories. I've written a couple of screenplays.” He goes, “They need writers. Actors are on every corner.” And that bit of advice from him added up to everything I did.


I read that you turned down villain roles in some pretty big movies. Why?Years ago, some old character actor told me, “You don't play the bad guy in a popcorn movie because that's who you'll be forever. Don't try to kill Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks, America's Sweethearts. Because the audience is going to remember you that way.” I always tell my agents, “I'm never going to try to kill Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks, ain't going to happen.”


Two years after your indie Sling Blade, you were making Armageddon, a huge Hollywood movie with a monster budget. How strange was that?It was pretty strange, I have to say. I'd never done anything like that. I don't think I've ever told this story to a journalist before, but we were doing a table read of the script to Armageddon at the Four Seasons. And Jerry Bruckheimer, to his credit, decided to cast some character guys in the movie. I was sitting between Steve Buscemi and Owen Wilson and Will Patton. Buscemi looked over at me and he goes, “Hey, bud, what the hell are we doing here?” I said, “Yeah, I know.” But I mean, I got to say, that movie stood the test of time, and they still play it all the time.

	











Do you think the superhero movie boom will be like the Western boom in the mid-20th century and will peter out eventually?I honestly don't know the answer to that question. The movie business has always been a business, but I think more so now than ever. And whatever the people want, that's what the studios are going to make. You can't blame the studios. They're an eating machine. They're a corporation. They want to make money. Oil, pharmaceuticals, tech, movie business, that's what they do. And so as long as people want that, they'll deliver it. With big movies, you can make toys from them. I don't know how many Tommy Norris toys we would sell from Landman, but you can sure sell toys if you're doing Batman. 


	I mean, you always hope and pray that we'll have that independent film boom that we had in the late Eighties through the mid Nineties. When I started out back there, me and Quentin Tarantino and James Gray and Nick Cassavetes and Ted Demme, we all knew each other. We were outsiders in an insider's world, as my friend Dwight Yoakam puts it, and it was a popular time for that. I have hope that it'll come back, but I don't have a lot of confidence that it'll come back.


You've been married six times. Did you ever have a point where you lost faith in the institution?Well, not now. Connie and I have been together 23 years and married for 12. Our daughter is 20. So, I found the right spot to be. The other times I got married were just like, you had a little too much to drink one night and somebody said, “We should get married.” You go, “Yeah, OK.” I always tell people, at least I was trying.


	And of course, Angelina [Jolie] and I had a great time together. That was one of the greatest times of my life. She and I are still very, very close friends. And that was the one that ended up being a really civilized breakup. We simply split up because our lifestyles were so different.


That was a crazy time, with paparazzi following you two around. What did you learn from that experience of briefly being a tabloid fixture?It was pretty weird. When we met, I was the more famous one. And then when we got together, for some reason, the people and the media are very interested in celebrity couples, that seems to be a very popular thing. So, it was weird. We couldn't go anywhere. I mean, we did, and then of course we had times when we would say things that became sound bites or whatever. 

	











People still talk about the vials of blood. Which never existed. We each had a little locket, literally with a drop of blood in them. That's a romantic little idea, and that's all that was. But by the time it's over, we're vampires. We live in a dungeon, we drink each other's blood, and this kind of stuff. 


You're also a musician with a rock band, the Boxmasters. Does it ever feel almost as if you're two different people, with those two facets of your career?Yes, absolutely. I grew up in the music world and was even a roadie for a lot of popular bands. I never dreamed I'd do anything else except being in the rock & roll business. I didn't know anything about movies. The only movies we saw in my little town in Arkansas, we had one theater, and we saw whatever Disney put out. It would be The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes or The Ghost and Mr. Chicken with Don Knotts or a Dick Van Dyke movie. I didn't know about movies until I moved to California.


Who's closer to the real you: The guy shooting the movie or the guy playing music onstage?The guy onstage with the band. It's closer to who I am. [As an actor,] I really do have to become these characters. I can't just walk out there and go, “OK, here we go.” It takes a lot of thought and work to [act].


What's the music that moves you most as a listener?The British invasions and the music of Memphis and the Southern California pop rock of the Sixties and Seventies. I mean, I'm always going to be the Who, the Beatles, and the Stones and the Kinks and the Animals.


What's the best concert that you've ever been to as a fan?A concert at Martin Coliseum in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1972. That's where we went for big concerts. The opening act was Freddie King. The second act was Tony Joe White. And Creedence Clearwater Revival were the headliners. I was standing about 12 rows back on psychedelic refreshments. They hit the opening chord to “Green River” the second the lights came on the stage. It was so powerful to me in that moment.


What's your biggest vice?I drink Michelob Ultra because there's 2.6 carbs, and you could drink a dozen of them. And I smoke American Spirits. I smoke like an old Buick. Those are the vices I have. I quit doing drugs when I was 24, never had it since. And gosh, maybe old television. I've spent way too much time watching old TV shows.

	











What are your favorite old shows?I watch Andy Griffith a lot. Colombo too. I watch all those detective shows.


What are the best and worst parts of success?The best part of success is being able to take care of my family and do something that I love in the process. There are a lot of ways you can take care of your family, but it involves a lot of work that's not necessarily creative. And if I don't create, I die. So being able to be creative and take care of my family in the process, that's the most important thing.

	The downside to it… There are a lot of things that people whine about. I can't think of one. I mean, you could say privacy, but I like people. I really do. I have to be dragged away by my publicist or my wife or my daughter sometimes. I talked to a lady whose son's in dental school for a half an hour on the sidewalk.


You're cool with strangers asking for selfies?Absolutely. You can ask anybody I tour with, anybody I make movies with, I'll stand there all day. I really will. It doesn't bother me at all. By the way, those are the people that put my kids through school. I feel blessed that they ask me. I really do.
