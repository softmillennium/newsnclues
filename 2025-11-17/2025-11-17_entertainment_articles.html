                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Deadline has learned that Michael Mann has his Public Enemies star Christian Bale circling a major role alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Heat 2. Amazon MGM Studios and United Artists will start production next year on the second installment of Mann's 1995 heist classic. The film is being produced by Mann, Jerry Bruckheimer, Scott Stuber, Nick Nesbitt and executive producers Shane Salerno and Eric Roth. It was not immediately clear which role Bale will play, but the script has drawn strong interest from top talent. Bale and DiCaprio have each won Oscars, giving Mann a chance to match the high bar he set with the original, which had Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Val Kilmer leading the ensemble. The 1995 Heat starred Pacino at Detective Vincent Hanna, De Niro as Neil McCauley and Kilmer as Chris Shiherlis. The book, published in 2022, jumps between two time periods. At the same time, Hanna is cutting his teeth as a rising star in the Chicago Police Department chasing an ultraviolent gang of home invaders. Bale is repped by WME and can be seen next opposite Jessie Buckley in the Warner Bros pic The Bride. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lily Allen and Dijon are also set to perform on upcoming episodes. Ariana Grande is going for a Saturday Night Live three-peat, with the sketch comedy series announcing Monday (Nov. 17) that she'll soon be returning to 30 Rock for her third time helming an episode. Rather than Grande serving as her own musical guest — which she did the first time she hosted the show in 2016 — Cher will come aboard to perform. The two weeks immediately preceding Grande's return are also sure to be exciting. The newly revealed hosts and performers build on an impressive run of guests this season, with Olivia Dean most recently providing music with Glen Powell hosting over the weekend. Before that, Sombr made his musical guest debut on an episode helmed by Nikki Glaser, and Sabrina Carpenter pulled double duty the week before that. Now, she'll lead the cast on an episode airing almost exactly one month after Wicked: For Good is released worldwide on Nov. 21.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disney releases director Thomas Kail's film in theaters next summer. Catherine Laga'aia and Dwayne Johnson are set to make a splash with the first trailer for Disney‘s live-action feature adaptation of Moana. Director Thomas Kail's remake of the original 2016 animated film hits theaters July 10, 2026. GQ's Will Welch on Managing Men of the Year Franchise and That Viral Sydney Sweeney Interview Moana centers on wayfinder Moana (Laga'aia) venturing beyond her island of Motunui with the help of Maui (Johnson) in an attempt to save her people. Kail helmed the live-action movie from a script by Jared Bush and Dana Ledoux Miller. Live-action remakes of popular animated properties continue to be a priority for Disney. The studio recently put a new version of 2010's Tangled back in development after it was paused earlier this year following Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot's live-action Snow White underperforming at the box office. Disney had a massive summer hit with the live-action remake of Lilo & Stitch, while Barry Jenkins' prequel movie Mufasa: The Lion King also had a strong showing when it debuted late last year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Recent SNL addition Veronika Slowikowska and Emmy winner Luke Kirby (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, The Deuce) are set to topline Close to Nowhere, an indie comedy marking the feature directorial debut of Samantha Carroll. Based on an original idea Carroll developed over several years, Close to Nowhere follows small-town Coco (Slowikowska), who, while struggling with unfulfilled artistic ambitions, concocts fake psychic abilities in an effort to impress a famous writer (Kirby). Amy Poehler Pretends To Recognize 'SNL' Newcomers In Latest Promo How 'Saturday Night Live' Introduced New Cast For Season 51 Producers on the project are Jonathan Grace, Jessica DiMento, Peter Heres, and Javier Gonzalez, with Carroll exec producing. A Chapman University Dodge College grad, Carroll first met key collaborators there, including producer Heres and DP Seannie Bryan.

One month into her first season as a featured player on Saturday Night Live, Slowikowska is a comedian and actress also known for starring as Kelly, the love interest to Shane Gillis, on Netflix's Tires. She has nearly two million followers across Instagram and TikTok, with additional screen credits including FX's What We Do in the Shadows and Peacock's Poker Face.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the AI slop era continues, we're entering a new and deeply troubling phase where some big publishers are beginning to unapologetically use the controversial technology to replace voice actors and artists. The latest case is Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which seems to heavily feature generative AI art in its unlockable calling cards (these are nameplates attached to your profile), posters, and reward icons, among other aspects of the game. While Activision didn't specifically confirm if these cosmetics were AI-generated, they did admit that AI was used to make the game in a statement to XboxEra, which is corpo speak for their developers probably used GenAI to create the images. Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed. On Twitter, Rep. Ro Khanna (CA) bashed the game's use of AI, citing it as an example of why greater regulations are needed around the technology. He called for artists to get a say in how AI is deployed, and that there should be taxes on “mass displacement” caused by these changes. While he frankly doesn't address the ecological concerns of AI and seems to acquiesce that it will become a central part of game development and society writ large, Khanna's rebuke of Black Ops 7's AI art ties into ongoing questions about how to regulate the rapidly growing technology. The Republican-led House of Representatives previously tried to slip a 10-year ban on state and local AI regulation from Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” before it was thankfully axed after heavy blowback from voters. As for Black Ops 7, its use of generative AI isn't the only reason why it's getting bashed. It's designed around co-op, but doesn't provide you with AI allies, meaning playing solo is a slow and painful process. It is also apparently set in a big reused map from its Warzone mode. The game is currently sitting at Mixed on Steam with only 42% positive reviews, and its Metacritic user score is the lowest ever for a Call of Duty game, at a brutal 1.8/10— yes, user reviews tend to be plagued by brigading, but at least Steam requires users to actually own the game to leave feedback. While the spread of AI nonsense is deeply depressing, at least it seems that many players aren't happy about it, with Steam reviewers describing the game as an “AI generated slop shooter” and that “If there was a an award for ‘Worst Game of The Year', there's no doubt in my mind that it would go to Black ops 7.” Hopefully, the blowback will convince at least some of these out-of-touch suits that, regardless of what Elon Musk-fanboys on Twitter say, most people do want their art crafted by humans instead of machines.

Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote the music for the film, and he scored an Oscar nomination for the original track “How Far I'll Go,” which is featured in the teaser for this film, but it also includes a number of other bops such as Maui's diddy “You're Welcome.” The original “Moana” released in 2016 and made $643 million worldwide at the box office, becoming one of Disney's biggest original animated hits of this century this side of “Frozen” and “Encanto.” Though an animated series was originally intended for Disney+ as a streaming exclusive, the series was eventually converted into a new theatrical film, which opened last year and made over $1 billion globally at the box office.

Seymour, 74, celebrated her “25th anniversary” with Zambetti on the day of her interview with HELLO!, which was published on October 28. So every month, on the fourth, he sends me roses, wherever I am, whatever's going on. The pair met at a Shwayze concert two years ago after John expressed interest in the Hallmark actress. “Our kids pretty much put us together. They're the ones that heard that he'd seen me and asked whether I was single or not,” Seymour told HELLO!, explaining that the “Buzzin'” singer is a “mutual best friend.” And it turns out John's always been his surrogate father.” “I honestly never thought I would find a really committed, healthy, lovely, loving relationship at this time of my life,” she told HELLO! He had a different life – his world was medicine and touring, and mine was running around the world making movies. I think we met each other at exactly the right time.” While she's enjoying her time and celebrating all the small milestones with Zambetti, Seymour previously revealed that marriage is not on her mind. “All I know is that right now, I am very happy,” she told People in May 2024. So, for right now, where I'm at is really good.” I just watched the show she did where she surprised her friend with a home renovation with The Property Brothers and Jane Seymour is funny, loyal, and gutsy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anya Taylor-Joy looked truly ethereal at the 2025 Governors Awards. To accessorize, she wore jewelry by Tiffany & Co.: a necklace with Akoya pearls and diamonds, diamond drop earrings, the Soleste diamond ring and the new Birds on a Rock Wings ring. Taylor-Joy isn't the first person to wear a gown from this collection; Kim Kardashian made headlines wearing a similar version to the 2025 Academy Museum Gala just a month ago. While Kardashian slipped into the nude-toned strapless version from the collection, she did opt for the matching face covering that walked the runway, causing her glam team to “silently cry” after perfecting hair and makeup that would go unseen. Kardashian is no stranger to wearing a face covering. She also committed to the look for the 2021 Met Gala, during which she wore a masked Balenciaga ensemble. Taylor-Joy, however, kept her beauty look simple with center-parted hair cascading down her back and minimal, natural makeup. Though the actress has yet to post the outfit on Instagram, a photo was shared on @checkthetag, with one commenter hysterically noting, “No one show this to Kim K.” Others focused on Taylor-Joy's other worldly air, writing, “This looks so dreamy on her,” “She is an angel!” and “THIS is how you wear the new Margiela couture! The wide-eyed blond actress gives off angelic vibes regardless of what she's wearing — this latest look just made it even more apparent — just add a halo and wings.</p>

To follow an artist through her many different eras…she really was that person for me.” Lorde returned the favor, going to see the show on Broadway in July. Lorde will play the O2 again on Monday night (Nov. 17), with the European leg of her tour running through a Dec. 9 date in Stockholm before winding down for the year on Dec. 16-17 with a double-down at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. In addition, Lorde has just been announced as a headliner for next year's All Points East festival at London's Victoria Park on Aug. 22, where she will perform alongside PinkPantheress, Zara Larsson and others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LeCroy is scheduled to be on the panel, It's All About To Go South, on Nov. 16 alongside fellow “Southern Charm” castmates Patricia Altschul, Venita Aspen, Salley Carson, Craig Conover, Austen Kroll, Molly O'Connell, Rodrigo Reyes, Shep Rose and Whitney Sudler-Smith. In June, LeCroy and her husband, Brett Randle welcomed their daughter, Teddi, who is the couple's first child together. The reality star also shares a 12-year-old son, Hudson, with her ex-husband Josh Hughes. At the time of her birth, Teddi weighed “only five pounds,” which led to her spending some time in the NICU, LeCroy told Us Weekly. Teddi ultimately came home after a two-week stay at the hospital. “She's breathing on her own and hasn't needed any oxygen or anything like that. She's kind of a little trooper,” LeCroy told the outlet. The highly anticipated 11th season of “Southern Charm” will be here in no time. The show is set to premiere on Wednesday, Nov. 19, and the trailer teased tons of drama along with some new romances. Things will begin with LeCroy's baby shower, which was highlighted in an exclusive clip shared by Bravo. The end of Season 10 showed Craig Conover and former “Summer House” star Paige DeSorbo having broken up. And it seems this new season has him embracing the single life, with possible sparks flying between Salley Carson and newcomer Charley Manely. Plus, it seems Conover and Austen Kroll's friendship troubles continue into this new season. Along with Conover, LeCroy, Kroll, Carson, Manely, the cast will include Shep Rose, Venita Aspen, Rodrigo Reyes, Molly O'Connell and newcomer Whitner Slagsvol.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sonic the Hedgehog is no stranger to reinvention. Sega's blue-quilled mascot has evolved a ton over time, making the leap from 2D to 3D, bouncing between genres, and getting a total aesthetic redesign in the process. But 2008's Sonic Unleashed was a game very literally about change, predicated on the concept of Sonic giving into his feral side by morphing into a monstrous “werehog.” The theme song from Sonic Unleashed is still a favorite among fans, who fervently rally its GOAT status online. Titled “Endless Possibility,” the track was originally composed by Sega's Tomoya Ohtani and performed by pop-punk band Bowling for Soup. Now, 17 years later, “Endless Possibility” itself is being reimagined with a newly re-recorded version produced in collaboration between Bowling for Soup, Wheatus (known for 2000's “Teenage Dirtbag“), and the viral cover band Punk Rock Factory. Rolling Stone has an exclusive premiere of the new rendition of “Endless Possibility,” which features vocals from Bowling for Soup's Jaret Reddick and Rob Felicetti, and Wheatus' Brendan Brown on lead guitar. Did you play a lot of Sonic the Hedgehog games when you were younger?I love the movies because I have a 13-year-old and he's been growing up with these new Jim Carrey movies, and I think they're so great. I knew that he was this fast little guy, and I always thought that he was this really interesting character. Sonic has a little substance in his heart as well. How did you end up working with Punk Rock Factory and Wheatus for the new cover?When I went to Punk Rock Factory, who I thought were the perfect band to do this with, because they've covered so many things in movies and television, but also video games and cartoons — I was like, “Dude, I've got the perfect song for us to do.” [This] song has a really serious cult following. It hasn't been available to them on a widespread scale other than just the random YouTube videos and stuff. The music really does lend itself to his pace. When I heard the track, I was like, “We're definitely onto something.” Then, well, we've got this show coming up at Wembley and Brendan [Brown] from Wheatus can actually shred on the guitar. So, I'm like, “Let's all three of us be on this song together, and it'll be thing that we can get out before the play the biggest show of Bowling for Soup's career.” Why is now the right time to bring this song back, 17 years later?First of all, Sonic being around and the movies doing so well is one thing, but also just the nostalgia of our music [and] our genre — what's going on with so many of us having celebrated 20 years of really big records and everybody's back out there on the road. ‘Metroid Prime 4' Has Been in the Works for Almost a Decade. ‘The Super Mario Galaxy Movie' Trailer Reveals Brie Larson's Rosalina ‘Lumines Arise' Is a Trippy Puzzle Game Beamed Into Your Eyeballs How does it feel to have a place in the legacy of Sonic through music, and for Sonic to be a part of yours?These are the kind of things [that] don't surprise me. If I get on a TikTok Live or something, you expect people to go, “Oh, ‘Girl All the Bad Guys Want' is the first pop punk song I heard,” or, “'1985' is the first single I ever bought.” Those are all things [where] I'm very lucky, but I can sort of expect to hear. The Sonic thing, it still kind of catches me off guard because it's still so much of, “Please put ‘Endless Possibilities' in your set.” FCC Chairman Shares Trump Post Calling for NBC to Fire Seth Meyers ‘Immediately' [For] so many people, this was their intro into the Sonic universe, and this song is a part of that exploration.

One of Rian Johnson‘s ongoing murder mystery franchises has had a tumultuous week, but the other appears to be stronger than ever. Benoit Blanc will be back on the case (and our Netflix screens) this holiday season in “Wake Up Dead Man,” the third entry in the mystery series that began with 2019's “Knives Out” and continued with 2022's “Glass Onion.” The new whodunnit sees Daniel Craig‘s brilliant detective visiting a church to look into the seemingly impossible murder of a monsignor (Josh Brolin) and investigating an ensemble of suspects played by the likes of Josh O'Connor, Glenn Close, Thomas Haden Church, Kerry Washington, Daryl McCormack, Jeremy Renner, Andrew Scott, and Cailee Spaeny, all while working alongside a police chief played by Mila Kunis.

Like its two predecessors in the Benoit Blanc series, “Wake Up Dead Man” premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, where critics praised Johnson for taking the franchise in a darker direction. For someone like Benoit, so steeped in rationality, so happy to announce he's a heretic while literally standing in a church, the question could not be harder to answer,” IndieWire's Kate Erbland wrote in her review. Tales are spun and then immediately tied back up into knots, and its Gothic drama provides a fresh new place for Johnson to play in his preferred genre.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anne Rice‘s erotic, Gothic horror novels—full of enticing, dangerous supernatural creatures who grapple with immortality, sexuality, and unfettered power in usually lush atmospheres—seem ripe for onscreen adaptations. It focuses on a human aptly named Guy (Nicholas Denton)—as if to outright note the show's basic nature—striving to make sense of a strange world as he comes face-to-face with vampires, dungeons, sexy clubs, and death. Up until then, adapting Rice's novels was a surprisingly tough endeavor, with the 1994 film led by Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and Kirsten Dunst as the only notable exception. (Its standalone 2002 sequel is best left forgotten, along with other projects like Exit To Eden and The Young Messiah.) Its first offering elevated the source material with a distinct take on Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson) and Lestat de Lioncourt's (Sam Reid) titillating, toxic romance. Unfortunately, neither follow-up has matched that first show's highs so far. He achieves this partly by making Louis a Black man (in The Vampire Chronicles, he's a wealthy 18th-century plantation owner) whose experiences in the South in 1910 bring IWTV a fresh cultural and historical poignancy. As IWTV progresses, it raises questions about the other inexplicable entities that populate this world, thus acting as a natural gateway to set up the Immortal Universe, which also includes 2023's Mayfair Witches and Talamasca: The Secret Order. In it, neurosurgeon Rowan Fielding (Alexandra Daddario) learns about her witchy lineage and slowly comes to terms with her own power. Along the way, she battles sinister spirit Lasher (Jack Huston), who has haunted the women in her family for generations due to a curse. As an adaptation, it's mediocre at best, stripping itself of the freakiness that made Rice's writing land—at least until the very end of season two. It's driven by a dull plot and choppy pacing, with little cast chemistry to boot. Created by The Blind Side‘s John Lee Hancock, who showruns alongside Mark Lafferty (Halt And Catch Fire), it has the makings of a breezy spy drama. Guy gets recruited by the mysterious Helen (Elizabeth McGovern) to work for Talamasca, a secret society that monitors, researches, and observes all things paranormal. Helen views Guy's mind-reading abilities as a potential weapon, while he accepts her offer to find his missing mother. Despite engaging performances, the rote narrative doesn't have much urgency or stakes. Chances are you'll end every episode by asking, “Who cares about that damn 752…or anything?” Club‘s review of this series even notes that the “mid-tier” Talamasca‘s strength is that it's “quenching the thirst of famished diehards between seasons.” This achievement is limited to guest appearances from IWTV‘s Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian) and Raglan James (Justin Kirk). Beyond that, Talamasca doesn't possess an intriguing structure, characters, or relationships, nor does it properly fill in the blanks of the lore ITWV and MW set up. But these lackluster programs were as stale as the zombies, despite being set in different locations and trying to connect timelines. Newer offshoots like Daryl Dixon, Dead City, and The Ones Who Live are particularly egregious, spinning boring yarns with some of TWD‘s beloved faces. Pulling off a stable TV franchise isn't easy. Not even bigwigs like the Marvel Cinematic Universe or HBO's Game Of Thrones have accomplished that, as seen with the inconsistency in tones and/or quality of their respective shows. But it's clear that, as TWD finally looks to wind down, AMC's placing all its bets on the Immortal Universe. Perhaps Talamasca‘s season-one finale (it hasn't been renewed as of this writing), along with The Vampire Lestat in 2026, will help turn the corner for a franchise that, without IWTV, feels a bit lifeless.
