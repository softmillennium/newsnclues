The CEO of $91 billion bond firm DoubleLine recently shared his take on an episode of Oddlots podcast. The $1.7 trillion private credit industry has been in focus lately amid high-profile blowups among big corporate borrowers, including First Brands and Tricolor Holdings, and as regional banks have come under scrutiny for problems with bad loans. And Gundlach thinks things are likely to worsen from here. He said that markets right now, from equities to fixed income, are overpriced, leading to a troubling outlook. "It has the same trappings as subprime mortgage repackaging had back in 2006." The relative lack of transparency and regulation in non-bank lending has shown that risks can go unnoticed for long periods of time. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon compared these troubled companies to "cockroaches," implying that more problems are likely brewing beneath the surface of the private credit market due to poorly underwritten loans made to struggling companies. Data from Rosenberg Research shows that problems in both household and corporate balance sheets may be rising. Gundlach highlighted the AAA ratings assigned to mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, which contributed to the subprime loan crisis of 2008. He raised the concern that private credit managers may not be able to realistically assess the value of loans on their books. "There's only two prices for private credit — 100 or zero," Gundlach noted. In Gundlach's view, the health of the US equity market may be the worst it's been in his entire career, and he thinks investors are misreading the current financial landscape due to its perceived strength, just as they did in 2008.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wall Street veteran Jeffrey Gundlach said many assets are extremely overpriced right now, urging investors to keep about 20% of their portfolios in cash to protect against a major downturn. Speaking on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast, the DoubleLine Capital CEO warned that the stock market looks dangerously speculative, saying it's among the least healthy he's seen in his entire career. The Dartmouth grad who started his Wall Street career in the mid-1980s at TCW Group today sees speculative excess in AI-related stocks and data-center investments, cautioning that momentum investing during a boom can end badly. Gundlach is especially worried about the rapid growth of private credit, a $1.7 trillion market that lends directly to companies. He said lenders are making "garbage loans" similar to what happened before the 2008 mortgage crisis, pointing to recent failures like auto lender Tricolor and car parts supplier First Brands Group as early warning signs. "The next big crisis in the financial markets is going to be private credit," he said. "It has the same trappings as subprime mortgage repackaging had back in 2006." Gundlach also criticized the push to sell private credit funds to retail investors, calling it a "perfect mismatch" where there's a promise for easy withdrawals despite the fact those assets can't typically be sold quickly. If investors pull money out, funds may be forced to sell at steep losses, he said. Despite his warnings, Gundlach admits it's hard to profit directly from this view. He won't short junk bonds, for example, because the trade keeps losing money, he said. Gundlach had recommended a 25% gold position in mid-September, based on his belief that inflation would stay stubbornly elevated because of the impact of tariffs on import prices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinclair disclosed a stake in fellow broadcast station owner E.W. Sinclair, which acquired a roughly 8% position in Scripps, per the filing, recently launched a strategic review of its own business that could result in a tie-up. In the filing, Sinclair said it has been engaged in "constructive" discussions regarding a deal and believes if it were to reach an agreement that a transaction could be completed within nine to 12 months. Sinclair said in the filing that based on trading multiples there would be an expected $300 million in synergies if a merger were to take place. Sinclair, which acquired the stake for about $15.6 million, declined to comment beyond the SEC filing on Monday. In a statement on Monday Scripps said its board "will take all steps appropriate to protect the company and the company's shareholders from the opportunistic actions of Sinclair or anyone else." "Scripps' board of directors and management are focused on driving value for all of the company's shareholders through the continued execution of its strategic plan," the company said in its statement. Broadcast TV station group owners have suffered like the rest of media companies in recent years due to the shift away from the traditional pay-TV bundle and toward streaming. These broadcast stations, for the most part, make the majority of their money from so-called retransmission fees, which are paid on a per-subscriber rate by traditional TV distributors. Broadcast station owners like Sinclair have been eager to do mergers as they push for deregulation under the Trump administration. In August, Nexstar Media Group, the biggest owner of these stations, agreed to acquire Tegna for $3.54 billion. Sinclair, meanwhile, is also considering spinning off or splitting its ventures unit, which includes pay-TV network The Tennis Channel and marketing technology business Compulse, which was recently rebranded Digital Remedy. Sinclair and its advisors held discussions with potential merger partners earlier this year, CNBC previously reported. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DETROIT — Ford Motor is partnering with Amazon to let the automaker's franchised dealers sell certified preowned vehicles through the online retail giant. Some steps, such as a final signature, may still need to be completed in person, Ford said. The deal comes two years after Amazon said it would allow auto dealers to sell cars through its site, starting with vehicles from South Korean automaker Hyundai. CPO vehicles are used but have been inspected, refurbished and certified by the manufacturer or dealer. They're considered a better quality of used vehicles than cars without the designation and have warranties, like a new vehicle. Amazon earlier this year also partnered with car rental company Hertz to sell used vehicles through its site. Ford on Monday said more than 160 of its roughly 2,900 U.S. retailers have "raised their hands" and started the process with Amazon. Thus far, about a dozen have fully onboarded and launched, with about 10 more launching next week, the company said. "The addition of Ford certified pre-owned vehicles to Amazon Autos represents an exciting expansion of our store, giving customers access to thousands of quality vehicles backed by Ford's comprehensive inspection and warranty programs," Fan Jin, global leader of Amazon Autos, said in a release. Ford said it will offer a 14-day or 1,000-mile money-back guarantee, whichever comes first, on vehicles sold through the Amazon tie-up. The automaker also will offer three CPO certification levels of vehicles, with varying warranty coverages. Ford said CPO vehicles are now available on Amazon Autos in Los Angeles, Seattle and Dallas, with plans to expand to additional cities in the coming months. Traditional automakers have complex relationships with dealers that are backed in many states by laws that make it difficult or illegal to bypass franchised dealers and sell new vehicles directly to consumers. There are less stringent laws regarding used vehicle sales, which makes it easier for companies such as Carvana, Hertz and others to sell preowned cars and trucks online directly to consumers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India is ramping up its energy imports from the U.S. in a bid to reduce its trade surplus with Washington — a key demand of the Trump administration during trade negotiations with New Delhi. On Monday, Hardeep Singh Puri, Indian union minister of petroleum and natural gas, announced a deal that will see the United States supply nearly 10% of New Delhi's liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) imports. "We believe that this move is for diversifying our LPG sourcing, which is currently concentrated in the Middle East, and also to reduce trade surplus with the U.S.," Nomura's equity analyst for energy Bineet Banka told CNBC in an emailed response. India's total LPG imports are around 20-21 million tons annually, he said adding that if 10% of that supply is sourced the U.S., at current prices, it implies an incremental import of $1 billion from the U.S. Since August, ties between the U.S. and India have been strained after Washington imposed a tariff of 50% on Indian goods. Reciprocal tariffs of 25% were imposed on Indian goods as part of a broad strategy to address trade imbalances and boost domestic industries, while the other 25% was due to India's import of Russian oil. In September, President Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of India, referring to trade ties with the country as "a totally one-sided disaster!" During that same month, Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, who was in the U.S. for trade negotiations, had reportedly said that India will increase its trade with the U.S. on energy products in the years to come. "And being close friends, natural partners, our energy security goals will have a very high element of US involvement," the Indian minister had said. Since then, the two sides have softened their stances, with Trump recently evoking memories of his last visit to India and referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as "his friend" and a "great man," as he addressed reporters at the White House on Nov 6. The U.S. President also said that India has "largely stopped buying Russian oil," a fact which is yet to be backed by data. According to data shared by tanker tracker, Kpler, as of Nov. 17, India's imports of Russian crude oil remain at a relatively high level, at 1.85 million barrels per day compared to 1.6 mbd in October. "Given that buyers are granted until Nov 21 to wind down transactions with Rosneft and Lukoil, Indian refiners are expected to rush to bring in as many barrels as possible in the next few days," said Kpler's Muyu Xu. But she added that India's imports of U.S. crude "saw a sharp rise in October, reaching 568 kbd (thousand barrel per day)—the highest level since February 2021." India imports around 5 million barrels per day of crude oil, according to data from Nomura which predicts that the total impact on the import bill will be around $1.1 billion, assuming that 35% of the Russian mix this year comes down to 15% and taking into account an average Russian crude discount of $3 per barrel. Experts are divided as to how this change of energy mix will affect India's economy. According to Nomura's Asia Economics team, "India could also stand to gain if this shift [away from Russian crude imports] leads to a trade deal with the US and the lowering of tariffs." But Rystad Energy's Pankaj Srivastava cautions that India's import bill is expected to increase. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actor-entrepreneur Mark Wahlberg paid $37 million for a fully furnished mansion in Delray Beach, Florida last month. The actor's transaction in October marks the home's fourth sale in that same time period, and a dramatic 118% price increase from its sale in January 2020 when the fully furnished mansion traded for $17 million. In Delray Beach, the average sale price for a single-family luxury home, represented by the top 10% of closed sales, rose by just over 78%; Los Angeles was up 30%; the Hamptons rose 44%; and Manhattan increased just 4.5% according to Elliman Report data from the first quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2025. Remarkably, the residence has traded hands four times since 2020. Three years later, Adzem represented the mansion's second owners who listed the home again, when it sold for $26 million, up 53% in just three years. Cafaro sold the home as part of a larger $50.5 million deal to purchase a Ferrari-inspired mansion less than half mile up the road in Stone Creek Ranch. Casa Maranello, as it's known, was being sold by local developer Aldo Stark, of Prestige Design Homes, with Adzem as the listing agent. He scrapped the old Sundara name and clad the home's old sheet-rocked walls in polished rare stones and bold high-gloss Guyana wood from Brazil. He installed vibrant green vegetation above a grand stairway and into the ceilings. Reemerging with a new look, new name, and a new price tag, one of the few things to remain the same was that Adzem was once again the listing agent. The home, now called Palazzo di Lago, debuted with an ambitious $45 million asking price, $19 million more than what Stark paid for it two months earlier and 165% more than what it sold for in 2020. By October Adzem closed the fourth deal and delivered Palazzo di Lago to its fifth owner, who the buyer's broker, Michael Costello of Compass, confirmed to CNBC was Mark Wahlberg. According to Florida's Multiple Listing Service, the fully furnished mansion closed at $37 million, $11 million more than what Stark bought it for seven months earlier, and up 118% from its 2020 sale. Five owners across five years seems like an unusually high turnover rate, but Adzem has a simple explanation. "People's circumstances change and they have different chapters in their life. According to Adzem, the mansion's remarkable appreciation was fueled by a multitude of factors. Adzem attributed a large part of the 54% rise in price from 2020 to 2023 to the pandemic, which made demand and prices for homes in South Florida surge. "After Covid, our market definitely accelerated," she told CNBC. Some of the other market dynamics driving the price of Palazzo di Lago are unique to Stone Creek Ranch, which Adzem described as a luxury "micro-market." It's a tight supply that's seen pricing dramatically impacted by a wave of new construction homes that have traded at record-breaking prices. Those recent comps helped push the price of Palazzo di Lago higher. Even the price of dirt in Stone Creek Ranch is on a steep rise. Back in 2013, the empty lot at 9200 Rockybrook Way traded for $800,000. In 2021, Adzem sold a comparable 2.5-acre lot for $1.7 million. "The last one they traded was $6 million," Adzem told CNBC. "However ... there are no vacant lots left in this community." And Adzem believes a more than threefold rise in the price of dirt here is just the beginning. She points to the fact that 2.5-acre lots worthy of a megahome are hard to come by in Palm Beach County, and the dwindling supply in this neighborhood in particular will push lot prices even higher. "I feel like the dirt is going to double because the only upcoming potential sales would be teardowns." Another market driver: the tiny community's growing list of VIP owners. In 2021, billionaire hedge fund manager and owner of the New York Mets, Steve Cohen purchased the home next door to 9200 Rockybrook Way for about $22 million, according to MLS. "[Potential buyers] typically do look to know who else owns in the community. Rich and famous residents can create a halo effect and make nearby real estate more desirable to potential buyers. And now some might even see Walhberg's new ownership as adding to the community's allure. Meanwhile, developer Aldo Stark just finished construction and recently moved into his own 32,000-square-foot mansion. Wealthy buyers looking to escape the tax burdens of their home states continue to see the tax advantages offered in Florida as a big draw and that helps drive and sustain demand. Adzem also credited Stark's renovation with adding to the estate's value. He really wanted to make an impact and put his own taste here," Adzem said. Adzem and Stark would only characterize the expense as "a multimillion-dollar renovation," so it's unclear exactly how much it took to turn a home built in 2017 into the new Palazzo di Lago. Correction: William Cafaro paid for the new home with $24.5 million in cash. A previous version of this story omitted the million.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Switzerland's fledgling trade deal with the U.S. is dividing opinion as government and business leaders welcome a "restart" for the country, while critics caution it amounts to a sellout to the White House. The trade deal, announced on Friday, saw duties on Swiss exports to the States slashed from 39% to 15% and Swiss companies pledge to make $200 billion in investments in the U.S., including promises to increase manufacturing Stateside. Switzerland had launched a charm offensive ahead of the deal, sending a group of top Swiss CEOs — including the heads of luxury goods giants Rolex and Richemont — to the States in early November, bearing gifts for U.S. President Donald Trump, including a gold Rolex watch and specially-engraved gold bar. Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin rejected criticism that the deal amounted to a capitulation to Trump, and also defended the use of business leaders to woo the White House. "We haven't sold our soul to the devil," Parmelin said in an interview with the Tagesanzeiger newspaper this weekend, adding that he was "satisfied" with the agreement and suggested it could still be tweaked and improved. "I would be proud if we were back to zero percent tariffs. Above all, it gives us a starting point for the next negotiations," he told the paper in comments translated by Google. Parmelin said business execs who had travelled to Washington were only there to "explain their position" and how tariffs were affecting trade. "But it's true: they have influence because they have many good contacts in the U.S. — and not just with the Trump family. Swiss industry leaders are certainly relieved that a framework agreement has been reached but it will take time to implement. Question marks remain over some of the details, such as whether Switzerland will have to accept U.S. meat imports like chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef, which are controversial in Europe, as part of the duty-free bilateral tariff quotas that have been agreed in principle. The framework agreement is non-binding too, with more talks set to take place to finalize details within the deal which will ultimately need the Swiss parliament, and potentially a public vote, to approve it. "They're going to send a lot of manufacturing here to the United States — pharmaceuticals, gold smelting, railway equipment — so we're really excited about that deal and what it means for American manufacturing." Swiss manufacturers are also relieved about the deal, according to Stefan Brupbacher, chief executive of Swissmem, an association which represents mechanical and electrical engineering industries who, he said, had seen a 15% drop in exports to the U.S. since August, with machine exporters hit even harder. "For our members, there is great relief, because first of all, coming down from 39 to 15% puts us at par with our main competitors from Europe and Japan, and hence why we suffered enormously over the past three months with a slump of exports to the U.S. between 15% and 40%," he told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition." "This 15% tariff rate puts us at par with our main competitors, and that is a basis on which we can restart," he said. The contraction, the ministry said, was "driven by a sharp decline in value added in the chemical and pharmaceutical sector, industry as a whole recorded negative growth." Alessandro Bee, economist at UBS, said in analysis Monday that despite the framework deal between the U.S. and Switzerland, UBS' base case scenario was that the Swiss economy would see GDP growth of around 1% in 2026, which, it noted, "is noticeably below the average growth of 1.9% over the past 15 years." "Growth should be supported by the domestic economy, while we do not expect any significant impetus from foreign trade," Bee said, cautioning that despite the reduction in trade duties, "tariffs on exports to the U.S. remain substantial and are likely to markedly slow export growth to the U.S. compared to the previous year." Noting that around half of Swiss exports to the U.S. are made up by the pharmaceutical industry, which was never affected by the 39% tariff, Bee said that any relocation of some pharma manufacturing to the States — which some Swiss pharma companies have flagged — could dent the economy further. "Nonetheless, Swiss pharmaceutical companies have indicated they are prepared to relocate production for the American market to the U.S., and this newly reached deal is unlikely to change these plans. We expect relocation of pharmaceutical production will weigh on Swiss growth in the medium term." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Niki Leondakis, the CEO of CorePower Yoga, a yoga studio with over 220 locations in 23 states. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I spent over 30 years in hospitality, and after leading three different hotel companies, I became CEO of Equinox. Then I went through some personal turbulence. So I took a break and tried to figure out what my life was going to look like in its next chapter. Business Insider's Power Hours series gives readers an inside look at how powerful leaders in business structure their workday. See more stories from the series here, or reach out to editor Lauryn Haas to share your daily routine. When I was going through that, the one thing that anchored me and helped me process my emotions was getting on my yoga mat every single day. So when the CorePower opportunity came my way five years ago, it was a dream job. I don't know if I would have been ready for any opportunity — but this one spoke to my heart. I travel a lot to different studios or markets. I split my time between Denver and San Francisco, where we're headquartered. So my routine is not exactly the same every day, but there are some constants no matter what. I'm very aware of the stress I carry in my body, and yoga helps me become more aware of it. Then I do a short meditation and try to think about a word that represents my intention for the day, like "patience" or "focus." I usually start my day with mushroom adaptogenic tea. There are claims about them helping with mental clarity and stress, and I'm prone to anxiety. I've done a decent job learning how to manage it, but I can let things spin me up pretty easily. It makes a huge difference in helping me gain perspective on whatever issues I have. I generally have something that I know has to get done, and I try to do that first thing so it's not hanging over my head. Then I get to my yoga practice. So, I'll either get on my mat at home and practice with her, or I'll go to a CorePower studio or tune in to a livestream. Even on the busiest days, I have what I call my minimum required practice, or MRP. Even if it's just 15 minutes, I try to do sun salutations, breath work, and ground myself. But if I had a really vigorous practice, I'll have Greek yogurt with chia seeds, fresh berries, and some low-sugar type of granola. Usually at that time, I'll have a second cup of my mushroom tea. My first calls are around 8:30 or 9 a.m., and I have them on Zoom or in our headquarters boardroom. I typically visit studios or meet with managers and leaders. Sometimes, I'll do a listening tour with our yoga teachers. I need time to process, or maybe send a follow-up email. When I have big presentations or something high-stakes, my assistant knows to schedule 30 minutes before the meeting so I can ground myself and do breath work. I think of my body, mind, and spirit as an iPhone. I find it enjoyable to interact in a big social environment, but the battery goes down. So I can't run from large group events to a meeting. During late spring, summer, and early fall, I try to wrap up my workday to get outside on a bike ride, a walk, or even a hike. Sleep has been a challenge my whole life, and it's still a work in progress, but I've adopted some routines that have helped me. No, because I didn't have enough sleep. I try to do something zen, like reading or puzzling. I still fall into the trap of staying up late sometimes, but I try to remind myself that my bedtime will impact my performance the next day.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chipmakers and analysts are warning of a memory chip shortage that could hit the consumer electronics and automotive industries next year, as companies prioritize massive demand from the artificial intelligence boom. In an earnings call on Friday, the CEO of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China's largest contract chipmaker, said that fears of a memory chip shortage were prompting its customers to hold back orders for other types of chips used in their products. "Everyone is hesitant to place too many orders or ship too much in the first quarter of next year because they don't know how many mobile phones, cars, or other products [the memory chip industry] can supply," said Zhao Haijun, SMIC's co-CEO, according to a Google translation. Analysts say these supply constraint concerns come as chip manufacturers focus on advanced memory chips used in artificial intelligence computing, with less focus on production needed for consumer products. "The AI build-out is absolutely eating up a lot of the available chip supply, and 2026 looks to be far bigger than this year in terms of overall demand," Dan Nystedt, vice president of research at TriOrient, told CNBC. AI servers primarily run on processors from chip designers like Nvidia. Memory suppliers have been chasing as much of this AI demand as possible thanks to typically high margins, Nystedt said, noting that AI server companies are willing to pay top dollar for premium chips. "It could be very bad for PCs, laptops, consumer electronics and automotive, which depend on cheap memory chips," he said. Perhaps a bigger issue, however, is that the memory industry suffered some severe downturns in 2023 and part of 2024, leading to under-investment in the industry. "They're building new capacity now, but it will take time to get running." Just last Friday, Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics had quietly raised prices on select memory chips by as much as 60% compared to September. Samsung didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. "With memory prices rising and availability shrinking, concerns about production bottlenecks are gaining traction," M.S. "Supply tightness is already hitting low-end smartphones and set-top boxes, but we think the risk could broaden," he added. China is "feeling the pinch more acutely" due to high reliance on low-cost devices, but Hwang cautioned that the supply constraints were a global problem. In a report on Monday, tech-focused market intelligence and consulting firm TrendForce predicted that the memory industry has begun a "robust upward pricing cycle," which could force downstream brands to hike retail prices, adding pressure on the consumer market.

Many people may learn about AI by playing around with ChatGPT. Of the 111 billionaire principals, 79% said they use the technology in their personal lives, and 69% said they use it in their businesses. Yet the ultra-rich clients, whose combined net worth tops $500 billion, also reported more niche ways they've used AI in the bank's 2025 Principal Discussions Report. When it comes to business, one respondent said that AI had helped them avoid $100,000 in legal research. Another said they first treated AI like "a toy" and would use it to make customized bedtime stories for their son. The tales would, they said, always end with an "emotional twist." A few of the respondents said they had flown out to Ivy League schools to take classes on AI use; some even made the courses a family affair. The boom in AI data centers is threatening sustainable energy targets, and the air-pollution-related public health costs could reach $9.2 billion annually, Business Insider previously reported. Some said they worry about job displacement related to the technology. Not all of the respondents have started to use AI, and some said they conduct their business communications over the phone, avoid computers, and "rely on manual calculation or intuition."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Bulwark, which launched in 2018, has become a prominent publisher on Substack and YouTube by leveraging anti-Trump sentiment among Republicans. "Google going to zero will not impact us at all," Last said. "Google Zero," an imagined future in which Google stops sending web surfers to external sites and answers all search questions within its own platform, has become a morbid talking point in media circles. People have become less likely to click on external links since Google introduced AI summaries in its search results, a Pew Research Center study found. In many ways, The Bulwark's strategy is typical of certain media startups that grew in the post-Facebook, post-search era. The founders of these startups have tried to avoid relying on referral traffic from tech platforms, determined not to repeat the fate of some in the previous generation of news and culture media companies. This story is one of a five-part series exploring the changing online search landscape and its impact on consumers, media companies, advertisers, and tech platforms. Vice Media and BuzzFeed, for example, were once valued at over a billion dollars each in the mid-2010s, when several tech giants, including Facebook, offered access to large audiences. Many digital publishers, including Business Insider, have also been affected by those algorithm changes. Newer media startups have their own platform dependencies — particularly on Google-owned YouTube for video — but have often tried to limit their exposure by focusing on direct reader relationships through email and events. "When you rely on a platform for your audience, you're at the mercy of the platform," Last said. Business Insider interviewed the founders of nine young media startups that have grown — often profitably — without relying on Google and Facebook traffic. They range in size from small operations like Emily Sundberg's Feed Me and the four-person, bootstrapped A Media Operator, to Semafor, which has 90 employees and has raised a net $34 million in funding. Major exits and big capital raises are rare in this new era, and no startups have anywhere near the head count of publishers like Bloomberg or The New York Times. One standout deal came in October, when Paramount Skydance bought Bari Weiss' The Free Press, the anti-woke media company born on Substack, for $150 million. Many newer media outlets started as email newsletters, enabled by platforms like Substack and Beehiiv, which offer financial incentives, community-building tools, and support services to journalists who migrate from mainstream news outlets. Some, including Status, Ankler Media, and Feed Me, were founded by solo operators. The Bulwark and Ankler Media, for example, use a mix of YouTube, social media, and their own fans to reach new audiences. That is a huge source of growth for us." One key takeaway from the founders: Media startups today must offer something readers can't get anywhere else, whether it's scoopy info or a unique point of view, to win subscribers. Ankler Media subscribers pay $169 annually for highly specific industry information, like what jobs are available in a shrinking Hollywood and which kinds of projects are getting the green light. The company is profitable and on track to make roughly $10 million in revenue this year, cofounder and CEO Janice Min said. "Sometimes you want to take a big swing at a story, but there's no point in doing the same thing everyone's doing. Oliver Darcy left CNN last year to launch the scoops-focused media newsletter Status, which now serves 100,000 free subscribers and employs four people profitably. An early coup: uncovering RFK Jr.'s relationship with New York magazine reporter Olivia Nuzzi, which drove a lot of subs. Worker-owned startup Hell Gate's pitch is that it covers New York with an irreverent, skeptical eye. Accountability stories like an exposé of the city's police watchdog agency sit alongside city-specific slices of life about parking privilege abuse and cheap eats. The company said it is profitable and expects to pull in around $850,000 in subscription revenue this year, supplemented by donations and newsletter ads. Global news outlet Semafor, one of the few startups in this cohort to raise outside capital, has distinguished itself through its target audience: elites who advertisers will pay a lot to reach. Semafor CEO Justin Smith bills his site as a "luxury news brand." He said this has helped the outlet charge as much as $200 per 1,000 ad impressions — four times the amount of its close competitors — and achieve profitability without a paywall. To cater to this audience, Semafor has focused on hiring big-name journalists, approaching coverage with a global mindset, and using formats that emphasize transparency. Many of today's startup founders make money from subscriptions, but have also expanded their revenue streams through live events and advertising. Ankler Media, built on Substack, gets 35% of its revenue from events sponsored by companies like Meta and McKinsey, which value the publication's narrow, focused audience. It has hosted over 200 events so far, and its 2025 World Economy Summit, held in April, convened more than 200 chief executives. Startups like Ankler Media and The Bulwark are also leaning into podcasts and video, which readers increasingly prefer to text articles. 1440, a daily news digest delivered via newsletter, makes explainer topic pages on subjects ranging from business to science and history, which it produces in both text and video formats. For emerging companies, getting direct payments from readers is often more lucrative and predictable than ad revenue. "Members are the only way that I've been able to figure out how to make this thing be sustainable for the long run," Last said. Over 110,000 of The Bulwark's 890,000 subscribers are paying customers, he said. One upside of a narrow focus: Many of these startups have built communities around their brands that, in theory, can translate into loyalty and subscription revenue. Community-building efforts can include hosting parties or encouraging people to comment in online discussions. Hell Gate and Feed Me, a "daily newsletter about the spirit of enterprise," have hosted parties for subscribers. That's "community right there, getting people out on a Wednesday night," said Sundberg, Feed Me's founder. Aftermath, a five-person publication covering gaming, speaks directly to the community by meeting readers where they are already congregating: the livestreaming platform Twitch. Still, cultivating community can be tough, especially with everything else founders have going on. Casey Newton, founder of tech-news startup Platformer, has shared online that it's been hard to get his audience of tech company employees to comment publicly on his Discord. The most dynamic media startups now are individual-fronted brands, said Brian Morrissey, founder of The Rebooting, a newsletter about building media companies. He cited "TBPN," the buzzy tech talk show, as an example. Sundberg built a profitable media business by serving as the primary voice of her Substack newsletter. While she is still the face of the brand, hosting events every other month, she now leads a small team of writers, editors, and freelancers. Ankler Media started around sharp-elbowed columnist Rushfield, but it has grown less reliant on him and Min as ambassadors for the brand as the staff has expanded to 14. Workweek launched in 2021 and built a business around a set of 21 B2B creators who wrote newsletters on topics such as fintech, marketing, and healthcare. Workweek CEO Adam Ryan said that the creators remain a core part of the business, but the goal is to build a system where readers can interact with each other, ask questions about their businesses, and create content. Even if they're not worried about Google search, these startups have their own set of headaches. Newsletter publishers are regularly fighting to avoid email spam filters and find new audiences as some of their existing readers unsubscribe. Substack has powerful recommendation features that can create a type of platform dependency. For upstarts built by journalists, selling subscriptions can be a big adjustment. "I'm the guy who deals with all the money, and this is my first time knowing anything about business," Aftermath's MacLeod said. Every path to making money in media has its challenges. And in ways still unknowable, AI will disrupt media. That's one reason many recent media founders have prioritized growing their operations slowly and sustainably. Well, that and the lack of easy VC money. "Each model has its own flaws," Morrissey said of the media landscape.</p>

The labor market is going through a Great Freeze, where employers and employees are staying put with few large-scale layoffs but little hiring. This is especially affecting new job seekers, like recent college graduates, and if you're looking for work, it's starting to feel like the sluggish recovery of the early 2010s — even if unemployment rates are still far below their post-financial-crisis highs. Back in 2021, the job market was still recovering from pandemic losses. Besides June 2024, Bankrate said that hiring hasn't been at this rate since 2013, when the economy was still in its slow, grinding recovery from the Great Recession. Still, Foster said it's harder to understand the job market with this rate because both supply and demand have dropped. "What's unusual, though, is how sharply hiring has fallen compared to the uptick in unemployment." The frozen hiring rates we're seeing now are typically only seen in much weaker job markets. Foster said this kind of hiring rate has historically corresponded to unemployment of 6.8%, suggesting that companies' hiring plans are "akin to a labor market that's still recovering from a recession." Foster said the US is in a "jobless boom, so to speak, where companies are expanding profits, the stock market is doing well, the economy is growing at the fastest pace in nearly two years, but growth is not happening because companies are expanding their payrolls." Instead, she said companies are investing in "productivity-enhancing technologies," such as AI. Some job seekers have taken matters into their own hands and are pursuing entrepreneurship instead, while others send out their job applications, hoping something will stick. Parents are watching their college graduates face rejection, some older job seekers worry about ageism, and others are taking temporary work to get by. Entry-level hiring dropped 6% in October from a year ago, based on LinkedIn. A separate Indeed Hiring Lab report using three-month moving average data found that retail, loading and stocking, and sales had the highest shares of junior-level job postings in August, but the report said advancement opportunities can be tough in those sectors. Foster said getting a job in today's labor market boils down to being patient, being determined, showcasing what makes you different from other job candidates, and leveraging personal connections. Laura Ullrich, the director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, previously told Business Insider that aspiring job switchers may need to look beyond their current sector for a new role because some are hiring more than others. She also suggested exploring part-time work or volunteer opportunities that you can add to your résumé. "I thought a year ago the job market was difficult," one job seeker who was laid off in late 2023 told Business Insider.</p>
