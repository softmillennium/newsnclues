                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“This shows the door is open,” Allen Institute investigator Anton Arkhipov said today in a news release. “It's a technical milestone giving us confidence that much larger models are not only possible, but achievable with precision and scale.” Arkhipov and his colleagues describe the project in a research paper being presented this week in St. Louis during the SC25 conference on high-performance computing. Fugaku is capable of executing more than 400 quadrillion operations per second, or 400 petaflops. A simulation program called Neulite brought the data to life as virtual neurons that interact with each other like living brain cells. “In our simulation, each neuron is modeled as a large tree of interacting compartments — hundreds of compartments per neuron,” Arkhipov said in comments emailed to GeekWire. “That is, we are capturing some sub-cellular structures and dynamics within each neuron.” During the full-scale simulation, it took no more than 32 seconds to simulate one second of real-time activity in a living mouse brain. The researchers acknowledge that much more work is needed to turn their simulation into a model capable of tracing the progress of a neurological disease. “If we want to mention something specific besides plasticity, then one aspect that is missing is the effects of neuromodulators, and the other is that we currently do not have a very detailed representation of sensory inputs in our whole-cortex simulations,” Arkhipov said. “For all of these, we need much more data than currently available to make much better models, although some approximations or hypotheses could be implemented and tested now that we have a working whole-cortex simulation.” “There's a distinction between whole-cortex and whole-brain,” he pointed out. “The mouse cortex (and our model of it) contains about 10 million neurons, whereas the whole mouse brain contains about 70 million neurons.” The human cortex alone contains not just 10 million neurons, but 21 billion. “Our work shows that very detailed microscopic-level simulations of larger brains may be possible sooner than previously expected,” Arkhipov said. “Here we are talking about technical feasibility of simulations, and it looks like such simulations even at the scale of the monkey brain are now within reach,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Peter Thiel is the latest investor to sell off Nvidia shares. According to regulatory filings, the billionaire's hedge fund, Thiel Macro, has offloaded its entire stake in Nvidia. The firm has sold 537,742 shares in its third quarter, which would have been worth around $100 million, according to Reuters estimates. There are many reasons why investors might decide to sell off their stake in a company, and not all of those reasons are worth giant alarm bells. But it does pique interest when those stakes belong to the world's most valuable company, and the decision comes mere days after another high-profile investor selloff. Just last week, prominent Japanese investor SoftBank shared that it sold its entire stake in the chipmaker. SoftBank and OpenAI are also partners under the Trump-backed data center build-out plan known as Stargate. As a result, any perceived distrust in Nvidia's trajectory is taken as a negative sign for the AI industry overall. It's not entirely certain what Thiel and SoftBank's sell-offs confidently signal about overall investor sentiment regarding artificial intelligence, and whether or not there is indeed an AI bubble, but it sure is adding on top of readily existing worries, and making people feel queasy. Companies, like Nvidia, have hit record valuations as investors are delighted by the potential gains that AI represents. But some believe that investor appetite is FOMO-driven and could be artificially inflating the actual value of these companies. Even some top tech executives like Sam Altman and Jeff Bezos have admitted to overvaluation. So what happens when that investor appetite just stops? All eyes are now on Nvidia's earnings report later this week to shed more light on whether the news from the past week is part of a newly forming trend that warrants worry or just a fluke. Windows Copilot can't even tell users how to correctly resize their text. Bezos' new company is a mysterious physical AI venture "Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Swedish automaker Volvo has cancelled a five-year-old contract with Luminar, the latest escalation in an increasingly-ugly brawl between the lidar sensor company and its biggest customer. The fight is happening during an existential moment for Luminar. One of them is Luminar founder Austin Russell, who resigned from the CEO role in May during an ethics inquiry. Luminar is also being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, recent filings reveal. Volvo invested in Luminar and helped the Florida-based startup get into some of its first production vehicles. But Luminar has faced challenges as a public company. It struggled to diversify away from Volvo, and in 2024 cut a fifth of its staff while deciding to outsource manufacturing of its sensors. Then, in May of this year, Russell abruptly resigned as Luminar revealed its board had opened a “code of business conduct and ethics” inquiry. The company told shareholders in a regulatory filing on that day that Volvo decided to no longer make Luminar's “Iris” lidar a standard sensor on its EX90 and ES90 vehicles. Volvo also told Luminar that it had “deferred” the decision of whether to include its next-generation “Halo” sensor in the Swedish automaker's future vehicles. Luminar said in the filing that it had “made a claim against Volvo for significant damages” and “suspended further commitments of Iris” for the automaker. Volvo told TechCrunch Monday that its “products can deliver a high level of safety and driver support, enabled by the cars' powerful core computing coupled with their advanced sensor set – with or without a lidar.” But, it added, the “situation has an effect on some customer orders.” It did not immediately explain whether that meant a delay, or something else. This story has been updated with comments from Volvo. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That was the storyline unfolding inside a darkened studio at Seattle Center last week, as Amazon's Kiro software development system was brought to life for a promotional video. In this tiny dramatic scene, Kiro's ghost mascot played the role that the product aims to fill in real life — a stabilizing force that brings structure and clarity to AI-assisted software development. No, this is not your typical Amazon Web Services product launch. Kiro (pronounced KEE-ro) is Amazon's effort to rethink how developers use AI. It's an integrated development environment that attempts to tame the wild world of vibe coding, the increasingly popular technique that creates working apps and websites from natural language prompts. But rather than simply generating code from prompts, Kiro breaks down requests into formal specifications, design documents, and task lists. This spec-driven development approach aims to solve a fundamental problem with vibe coding: AI can quickly generate prototypes, but without structure or documentation, that code becomes unmaintainable. It's part of Amazon's push into AI-powered software development, expanding beyond its AWS Code Whisperer tool to compete more aggressively against rivals such as Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini Code Assist, and open-source AI coding assistants. Gartner expects AI code assistants to become ubiquitous, forecasting that 90% of enterprise software engineers will use them by 2028, up from less than 14% in early 2024. Positive early reviews were tempered by frustration from users unable to gain access. Capacity constraints have since been resolved, and Amazon says more than 250,000 developers used Kiro in the first three months. The internet is “full of prototypes that were built with AI,” said Deepak Singh, Amazon's vice president of developer agents and experiences, in an interview last week. Kiro solves that problem by offering two distinct modes of working. In addition to “vibe mode,” where they can quickly prototype an idea, Kiro has a more structured “spec mode,” with formal specifications, design documents, and task lists that capture what the software is meant to do. Now, the company is taking Kiro out of preview into general availability, rolling out new features and opening the tool more broadly to development teams and companies. That flexibility and broader reach are key reasons Amazon gave Kiro a standalone brand rather than presenting it under the AWS or Amazon umbrella. It was a “very different and intentional approach,” said Julia White, AWS chief marketing officer, in an interview at the video shoot. White, a former Microsoft and SAP executive who joined AWS as chief marketing officer a year ago, has been working on the division's fundamental brand strategy and calls Kiro a “wonderful test bed for how far we can push it.” She said those lessons are starting to surface elsewhere across AWS as the organization looks to “get back to that core of our soul.” The marketing strategy for Kiro caused some internal hesitation, White recalled. People inside the company wondered whether they could really push things that far. People at the stations were not exactly thrilled by Amazon's naming choice. During the preview period, Kiro handled more than 300 million requests and processed trillions of tokens as developers explored its capabilities, according to stats provided by the company. SmugMug and Flickr are among other companies espousing the virtues of Kiro's spec-driven development approach. With the move to general availability, Amazon says teams can now manage Kiro centrally through AWS IAM Identity Center, and startups in most countries can apply for up to 100 free Pro+ seats for a year's worth of Kiro credits. New features include property-based testing — a way to verify that generated code actually does what developers specified — and a new command-line interface in the terminal, the text-based workspace many programmers use to run and test their code. A new checkpointing system lets developers roll back changes or retrace an agent's steps when an idea goes sideways, serving as a practical safeguard for AI-assisted coding. Patel said this reflects the larger acceleration of software development in recent years.

Just yesterday, we covered Granite Rapids-WS, the next launch in the Xeon series, and today we have confirmation from Intel on how Diamond Rapids will shape up. Speaking to ServeTheHome, an Intel spokesperson clarified: "We have removed Diamond Rapids 8CH from our roadmap. We're simplifying the Diamond Rapids platform with a focus on 16-channel processors and extending its benefits down the stack to support a range of unique customers and their use cases." The existing Granite Rapids server chips, along with AMD's competing EPYC Turin lineup, top out at 12-channel memory, which will be upgraded to 16-channel with next-gen products from both companies. Those numbers are achieved not just through more DDR5 channels, but also because Diamond Rapids is tipped to ship with 2nd-generation MRDIMM (Multiplexer Rank Dual Inline Memory Modules) that will boost the maximum memory speed from 8,800 MT/s on current-gen Xeon 6 to a whopping 12,800 MT/s. Xeon 7 will also use the new LGA9324 socket, and top out at 192 cores distributed across 4x 48-core compute tiles. In the meantime, Diamond Rapids will go up against AMD's EPYC Venice lineup next year, which is rumored to feature up to 256 cores built on the 2nm Zen 6 microarchitecture, so Intel may lose core-count parity, at least on the server side. The now-cancelled 8CH Diamond Rapids would've succeeded existing 8CH Xeon 6 6700P/6500P SKUs that are designed to be cheaper, but cost-effectiveness often goes out the window when it comes to scaling data centers, especially these days.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nature can get downright brutal in the most unexpected ways—especially when parasites are involved. For the well-organized society of ants, some parasites are known to topple the existing social order to enslave their hosts. But new research suggests that this unsettling behavior might not even be the most disturbing thing that parasitic ants are capable of doing. In a paper published today in Current Biology, researchers captured how a parasitic ant queen essentially tricks worker ants into killing their own queen—their mother. A blog post by study lead author and “ardent ant enthusiast” Taku Shimada motivated the study, according to Keizo Takasuka, study senior author and an entomologist at Kyushu University in Japan. Shimada had filmed the parasitic ant species Lasius orientalis inducing matricide in host colonies, Takasuka explained to Gizmodo. This pattern deviated from previously known forms of parasitism in ant colonies, which typically had the invading queen throttling or beheading the host queen. After a few hours of repeating this behavior, the colony dynamics began to shift, Shimada noted. Both queens were surrounded by worker ants—but the workers were chewing away at their own queen while treating the intruder as their leader. “What I found somewhat strange was that the worker ants, who also presumably were sprayed with the fluids, were not attacked. Could there be some secret hidden in this fluid? The new paper serves as a formal description of Shimada's observations, coupled with several long-term experiments replicated by Takasuka and colleagues in the lab. The team has yet to chemically verify the fluid composition, although they believe it is likely some form of formic acid. “In temporary social parasites, eliminating the host queen is a crucial task, yet how this occurs is poorly known because it happens underground,” he said. “Life histories are full of astonishing adaptive strategies, most of which remain unknown to us—often because they are physically hard to observe or cannot be grasped from brief glimpses.” Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

It claims that certain channels are now requiring customers to purchase motherboards alongside DRAM modules at a one-to-one ratio, or risk being denied access to memory stock entirely. This type of allocation control has reportedly never been seen before in the DRAM industry. It appears that distributors are using high-demand memory modules to drive additional board sales, a tactic more common in constrained consumer electronics markets than in the hardware space. The global DRAM memory chip shortage has become so severe that some distributors are requiring clients to buy motherboards with DRAM modules together, an unprecedented move that has sparked hot sales of motherboards, media report, noting Taiwan's Asustek, Gigabyte, MSI are…November 17, 2025 Dan Nystedt, a Taipei-based financial analyst known for translating and tracking Taiwan's tech industry media, relayed the news in a post on X, noting that the bundling policy has “sparked hot sales of motherboards.” DRAM contract prices are now up roughly 170% year over year, driven largely by demand from AI server manufacturers, and TrendForce recently raised its Q4 DRAM forecast to 18-23% growth quarter-over-quarter. On the client side, Mini-PC maker Minisforum recently hiked prices for prebuilt configurations that include DRAM and SSDs, while keeping barebones SKUs untouched, a move it explicitly attributed to “significant increases” in its overall costs. While the bundling tactic described in Taiwanese media appears to be localized to that market for now, it illustrates how DRAM allocation is tightening across the entire supply chain. It also highlights how downstream buyers could face new hurdles as hyperscalers and smartphone manufacturers continue to hoover up most of the available capacity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You've got about two to three years, give or take, before your beloved bed sheets and feather pillows are going to give up the ghost and need replacing. Electronics are also complicated to dispose of, given that batteries can't be thrown in the trash, yet you want to free up some storage space. When their time is up, you must—in the most literal sense—lay them to rest. I take the mantra of “reuse, reduce, and recycle” very seriously, and will eke out as much extra mileage as I can by cutting up old sheets and towels to use as cleaning rags, or making a ratty old pillow into a makeshift dog bed. Recycling programs near me don't accept textiles, so eventually I have to toss them into the trash, knowing they're headed to a landfill. However, thanks to a targeted social media ad, I found a textile-recycling subscription service that's the answer I've been looking for: Trashie. The bags come in packs of one or three. There is also the “Take Back Tech Box” for $25, where you can send back old electronics that have been collecting dust in a drawer. In return, you earn points for discounts or gift cards at major retailers like Cozy Earth and Nuuly. You can also shop and earn points at partner sites, like Parachute. So, if you've been looking for an excuse to get rid of last season's trends that not even the thrift store would want (goodbye, puffy quilted tote bag; I do not understand why this was a trend), this is it. Dr. Andre West, director of The Zeis Extension (ZTE) at North Carolina State University's Wilson College of Textiles, corroborated the UN's and EPA's data in his research. And he says the problem of textile waste is only getting worse. Fast fashion is to blame for a lot of this, he says. I don't see it slowing down at this point in time.” Furthermore, it's hard to track where textile waste ends up, and thus, calculating exact numbers like this can be quite the undertaking. “Sorting products is still in its infancy of how to do it properly," he says.. “Even if you sorted by color, they're all made from different materials with buttons, zippers, and linings.” He also told me that items can oftentimes be mislabeled. Into my Take Back Bag went a duvet cover that my dog chewed holes in and some old linens that were the material version of a Walking Dead zombie. You can also throw in clothing that isn't suitable for donation. Trashie accepts a pretty extensive list of recyclable items (assuming they're clean), which you can find here. It takes much longer to earn a substantial number of points this way, and you're not recycling anything. I reached out to Trashie's CEO and founder, Kristy Caylor, to learn more about Trashie and what she envisions for the future of textile recycling. Once shipped off, your bag is ultimately delivered to one of Trashie's recycling centers. “These partners work according to the Global Recycled Standard. We prioritize working with partners that are geographically close to our domestic sorting operations to minimize shipping and reduce our carbon footprint.” To touch on the sorting process, it's kind of like when you separate your paper, plastic, and glass recyclables. The rest continues its way through Trashie's recycling process. As stated on Trashie's website, “Reusable items are redistributed through a network of global partners, ensuring they reach the right people at the right time.” I asked Caylor about this, too, curious to see where these charity items wound up. Here's what she told me: “When items are designated for reuse, they're redistributed through our domestic and international network of retailers who have a specific need for those categories—everything is sorted by product type and condition to ensure the right match. This category-based approach maximizes reuse and significantly reduces what ends up in the trash. Some items flow through charitable channels across the US, where we supply seasonally relevant products to meet local needs.” A more recent example of local needs can be seen with Trashie's outreach to those affected by the LA wildfires, working to apply not only the Trashie recycling process but get clothing resources to those in dire need. Kind of like how recycling itself is a circular process. Trashie handles both e-waste recycling and data purging domestically as a security measure. No outside parties are involved; handling in-house controls access to devices and data during this process. If you're as curious as I am about what my duvet cover is going to be transformed into, I asked Caylor about that, too. "For example, cotton sheets might be turned into the soft fill used in pet bedding.” Ironic how my dog Randy could prevail in this situation with a new bed, given that he destroyed the duvet. Once your Trashie account is all set up, there are two main categories of rewards: the “Premium” ones that you apply points to, or the ones I lovingly refer to as “the freebies.” You can peruse both these categories daily to see if any new brands have joined the roster. The free ones usually include coupon codes to apply at checkout, whereas the Premium offerings deduct points from your overall TrashieCash sum, often for an even better discount. Trashie also has a Chrome extension that helps tally up points and discounts when you shop via partner sites. Many options cost five TrashieCash points for an exclusive discount code, like a $20 discount at Cozy Earth for a purchase of $60 or more. In the case of Andie Swim, 20 points equals a $20 discount. While you can't apply points to buying another Trashie TakeBack Bag directly from the site, here is a workaround: You can use them to purchase it on a partner site that offers them. If you don't want to buy bags individually, you can also sign up for a subscription to get a bag every month, three months, or six months. You may have all sorts of streaming subscriptions, but a recycling service is an easy way to reduce your environmental impact while still getting benefits. As for me, I'm excited to get a replacement duvet cover with my points—looks like I'll be cashing in on that Cozy Earth deal after all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the tech world remains fixated on Nvidia's staggering valuation and Intel's ongoing turnaround saga, AMD, under the steady hand of CEO Lisa Su, has been quietly executing a multi-year masterclass in strategy. The results speak for themselves: a record revenue of $9.2 billion, soaring 36% year-over-year (YOY) and obliterating consensus estimates. AMD is no longer just the scrappy underdog; it's a quiet giant steadily outmaneuvering rivals by capitalizing on their core weaknesses, like Intel's market vulnerabilities and Nvidia's growing list of self-inflicted problems. For years, Intel-based servers and Nvidia-based AI platforms were the “safe” choice. Recent candid remarks from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella validated this sentiment. Nadella revealed that Microsoft has a stockpile of advanced GPUs it cannot deploy because it lacks the data center “warm shells” with enough available electricity to plug them in. This dynamic is where Nvidia's “performance at all costs” mantra hits a wall of physical reality. That reality has created a golden opening for a competitor focused on efficiency and real-world deployment, and AMD is walking right through it. Nvidia's success has placed the company on a dizzying pedestal, but that height comes with its own kind of gravity. In that environment, it's easy for blind spots to form — and for the company's focus to drift away from what customers increasingly care about: cost and power. This strategy, as outlined at the analyst day, is a multi-pronged assault: compute technology leadership, data center leadership, pervasive AI, open software platforms, and custom silicon. This disciplined execution is a hallmark of AMD's leadership team, many of whom, including Lisa Su and CTO Mark Papermaster, share roots (as I do) at IBM. They are perceived as collaborators, not dictators, who are willing to build custom silicon solutions rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all proprietary product down a customer's throat. AMD's Q3 results show it is masterfully executing a pincer move, attacking both its rivals on their home turf. On one front, AMD is systematically carving up Intel's heartland: This growth is so robust that AMD delivered a record quarter despite an $800 million Q2 charge tied to U.S. export restrictions on its MI308 China-bound chip. At the center of that growth story is the Helios Rack, a full AI building block built around AMD's next-gen CPUs, GPUs, UALink, and AI NICs, all tuned for ROCm. Notably, partners — not AMD — will sell these systems, positioning them as a more open and efficient counterweight to Nvidia's vertically integrated stack. This forecast, which excludes any revenue from the restricted China chips, shows that AMD's growth is now fully self-sustaining. AMD's Q3 2025 financial report is a powerful testament to the value of quiet execution over market hype. The company is perfectly poised to slipstream Nvidia in the AI race by offering a more efficient, open-source, and customer-friendly platform, all while simultaneously exploiting Intel's market weaknesses to capture record share in the client and server markets. This dual-front war is succeeding, and the record-breaking $9.2 billion revenue — achieved despite significant geopolitical headwinds — proves AMD's strategy is not only working but accelerating. At the heart of the system lies AMD's Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 (12-core/24-thread, 4 nm Zen 5), paired with Radeon 890M graphics and up to an 80 TOPS NPU for on-device AI workloads. Other reviews note that it outperforms many competitors at comparable prices in both CPU and GPU tasks. With support for up to 128 GB of RAM and dual SSDs (one 2280, one 2230), the A9 Max offers unheard-of upgrade headroom in many mini PCs. With its compact dimensions of 135 × 132 × 47 mm and all-metal build, the A9 Max blends into dorm rooms, family living areas, or talented teens' streaming setups with ease. Its compact chassis frees up desk space for both homework and play. If you're shopping for a micro-PC that doesn't compromise on performance, the Geekom A9 Max is hard to top. At $999, it delivers full-sized power in a mini package — perfect for both gaming and creative pursuits. Rob Enderle has been an ECT News Network columnist since 2003.

I'd further suggest that the choice to phrase the idea in terms of a general population with a flaw, and implicitly claiming non-membership in that group, it's possible you're engaging in that same behavior.

... Sometimes, at least in humans, social interactions can also increase our irrationality instead. But chimps don't seem to have this problem. Engelmann's team is currently running a study focused on whether the choices chimps make are influenced by the choices of their fellow chimps. “The chimps only followed the other chimp's decision when the other chimp had better evidence,” Engelmann says. “In this sense, chimps seem to be more rational than humans.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In case OpenAI's structure couldn't get any weirder—a nonprofit in charge of a for-profit that's become a public benefit corporation—it now has two CEOs. There's Sam Altman, chief executive of the whole company, who manages research and compute. Simo hasn't been seen much at OpenAI's San Francisco office since she began as CEO of Applications in August. But her presence is felt at every level of the company—not least because she's heading up ChatGPT and basically every function that might make OpenAI money. Simo is dealing with a relapse of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) that makes her prone to fainting if she stands for long periods of time. “Being present from 8 am to midnight every day, responding within five minutes, people feel like I'm there and that they can reach me immediately, that I jump on the phone within five minutes,” she tells me. OpenAI's famously Slack-driven culture can be overwhelming for new hires. Simo joined during a chaotic period for OpenAI, which is expanding in nearly every direction. There are sovereign AI partnerships, new model releases, retail partnerships, multibillion-dollar compute deals, a proprietary chip, a mysterious hardware product—and of course, ChatGPT. “We do not battle for scope,” Simo says. Outside Silicon Valley, Simo's hiring came as a surprise. For those in the know, it was less of a shock. A native of Sète, a small fishing town in the south of France, Simo made a name for herself running the Facebook app at Meta before taking the top job at Instacart in 2021. She took the grocery startup public two years later. In the Valley, she's known as a product visionary with a reputation for scaling consumer apps across the globe. Simo's role at OpenAI is, in large part, to do the same—turn the company's research breakthroughs into moneymaking, must-have consumer products. She faces staggering competition from tech giants like Google and Meta, as well as AI startups founded by OpenAI alums, including Thinking Machines Lab, Anthropic, and Periodic Labs. “The thing that keeps me up at night is that the intelligence of our models is well ahead of how much people are using them,” Simo says. “I see my job as closing this gap.” Since she arrived, Simo has overseen the launch of Pulse, a product that connects to users' calendars and gives them personalized information based on their schedule, chat history, and feedback; created a jobs platform to allow people to get AI-certified and look for roles that make use of their skills; and doubled down on improving ChatGPT's responses to people having acute mental health crises. Eventually, sources say, she'll be the person deciding how to roll out ads in ChatGPT's free tier. We're sitting in the light-filled modern farmhouse where Simo lives with her husband, Rémy, and their 10-year-old daughter. A former engineer, he now makes desserts full-time. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. What has that working relationship been like? Fidji Simo: What Sam wanted was the ability to focus on research and compute, so I am trying to make sure that he can free up his time. I see my role as making that product company incredibly successful while respecting the culture of the research lab. When you're coming into a job like that, is someone checking your references? I think Sam had gotten references on me for like three years. Sam and I worked in the same circle, so he knew about my reputation. I don't think he literally picked up the phone and was like, “Is she legit?” In this particular situation, I don't think Sam called him. You've talked about how at Meta you took risks and at times put your role and reputation on the line. Well, taking the job felt pretty risky to me [Laughs]. I would say the thing that I don't think we did well at Meta is actually anticipating the risks that our products would create in society. Mental health and jobs were my first two initiatives when I came into the company. I was looking at the landscape and being like, “Yep, immediately, mental health is something that we need to address. That's not going to be easy, because the path is uncharted. So it is a very big responsibility, but it's one that I feel like we have both the culture and the prioritization to really address up-front. How do you feel the company is doing on mental health right now? We have launched parental controls with leading protections. And we are working on age prediction to protect teens. At the same time, when you have 800 million people [per week], when we know the prevalence of mental health illnesses in our society, of course you are going to have people turn to ChatGPT during acute distress moments. And doing the right thing every single time is exceptionally hard. So what we're trying to do is catch as much as we can of the behaviors that are not ideal and then constantly refine our models. Every week new behaviors emerge with features that we launch where we're like, “Oh, that's another safety challenge to address.” A good example is mania. You look at the transcripts, and sometimes people say, “I feel super great. I haven't slept in two days, and I feel on top of the world.” A clinical psychologist would understand that that's not normal—that's mania. But if you look at the words, it seems fine. So we work with psychologists to detect the signal that this isn't someone being super excited, this is a sign of mania, and have a strategy to intervene. Getting it wrong is also really annoying. OpenAI is obviously one of the world's most valuable startups, if not the most valuable, but it's also losing billions of dollars every year. That is incredibly valuable, and we have barely scratched the surface. Meanwhile, on the enterprise side, we sell an API and ChatGPT Enterprise, which is a great product but a very thin layer compared to all the things that we could be building for enterprise. If you think about building agents for every industry and function, there is so much to build, either by us or by enabling third parties to build on top of our platform. So I'm like, OK, the markets are huge. Or the fact that a lot of the US economy seems to hinge on OpenAI and Nvidia at this point. So first off, a lot of people say, “Whoa, these compute deals are massive,” but when you look at how constrained we are internally and how much more we could do if we had more GPUs, it's very clearly the right decision. I know these deals look risky on the outside, but on the inside, what's much riskier would be to not lean into compute. The companies that we're making these deals with are extremely sophisticated. They are providing these kinds of deals and this kind of financing because they are very close partners who know our business very well. You take a product like Pulse, which we launched through the Pro tier. I'm giving you one example, but there's 10 of those. On health, Pulse tells me every morning if there's new studies published about anything related to my condition. Previously I had to research all of that. And instead of going to a medical journal, it's all summarized in line and very clearly laid out. As you know, staying on top of AI news is a challenge. Having Pulse deliver a quick summary of what happened in the AI world is super helpful. My husband is a chocolate maker, and he's building an advent calendar. Pulse was like, ‘Oh, you should hide a message in all of the different windows.' I'm curious what you've learned from managing these two things simultaneously? If you are able to give your all to a job, you can come up with a lot of accommodations that make it possible. I recognize that I'm incredibly lucky to have worked at supportive companies, and that's not the case for everyone. Because people never see someone senior with a chronic illness be public about it, a lot of people assume that that's just not possible. It's not easy every day, just to be clear. But it's a matter of determination and prioritization. In a way, it has also made me more aware of product opportunities that I wouldn't have been able to see before. My passion for health has allowed me to narrow in on things that we can do to help with health care. I was on bed rest for five months. So I was at a real risk of losing her. I worked the entire time through my pregnancy. It wasn't cool at the time to work from home. Then I had surgery for endometriosis in 2019, which made the POTS even worse. So since 2019, I haven't come out of it, basically. You asked what I've learned from this. I care a lot as part of my own mission about everybody realizing their full potential. I want a world where health conditions don't get in the way. We can have technologies that make it easier. I think if I had gotten sick a lot earlier and we didn't have norms to be on Zoom, that would've been a lot harder. Constraints also force you to be more creative. I think these very hard physical constraints have forced me to be very intentional about how I lead. On day one, I sent a message to everyone explaining in detail my condition, because there is a real challenge with invisible illnesses. You'd look at me and think I'm fine. And so explaining very transparently like, “Hey, I would really love to be in the office right now more than anything, and there are some days where I'm going to be able to do that, and there are some days where I have to work reclined.” I think that actually created a lot of trust. It created vulnerability up front, and that's not easy. I agonized about it for a couple weeks. I have heard from a lot of people that your Slack game is very strong. Part of your mandate is figuring out how ads would work inside ChatGPT. How might that look, and what's your timeline? We have a ton of it already, people coming and asking for shopping advice. The important thing before we ever consider ads is making sure that our commerce experience is fantastic and that people come and really explore all the products that they want and get great recommendations. So you're not at the point where if someone asks for shopping advice, they might get recommended a paid product? That's why we haven't announced anything on ads, because if we ever were to do anything, it would have to be a very different model than what has been done before. You were prepared for the ads question. I have been asked that many times now. It seems like OpenAI is expanding in a lot of different directions at once. And the way you solve that is simple. You attract the best talent, so instead of one person being across 15 projects, you have the best leader for every single project. I'm very focused on hiring and making sure that we have the best possible talent. We believe that every category of software is going to be reinvented for AI, and that we have a role to play in making sure that all of the products that we use in the future are AI-­enabled, AI-native from the ground up. So it does require having that level of ambition and the capabilities to fulfill that ambition, which is really my job in building out the company. Sora, OpenAI's video app, launched with a pretty minimal slate of safety features and guardrails. What was the thinking behind that approach? I actually think it launched with a pretty good set of safety features. We rolled out parental controls that let parents control how their kid's likeness can be used. They can control what hours their kid uses the app. The control that I can have over my likeness is advanced and thoughtful I think, even for adults. At the same time it's a completely new form of interaction. So we are learning and refining based on the feedback. I was thinking about the copyright cases, where it felt like you were more reactive. What we're hearing from copyright holders is that there is actually a lot of excitement about this new media and how their IP could go in the hands of fans in a way that increases fan engagement. But they want to make sure that the value exchange is well established. The app got criticized as being, essentially, AI slop. I think every new form of media goes through phases. First, it's an imitation of what exists. If you look at cinema for example, it started by being just a recording of people on stage before close-ups or different shots were introduced. Here I think we're in the same world where AI is trying to copy human output, and potentially in places with a worse version. What I'm interested in is when it moves to the next stage of true experimentation with what's unique about the medium, and we're starting to see that emerge. I worry a little bit about paternalism around the narrative of slop. I have a friend who has a small business, and the business plan that she gets from ChatGPT, yeah, it's not Goldman Sachs, but she will never get access to Goldman Sachs. We need to be looking at this new medium as raising the floor of what could be created before and giving minimum access to people who didn't have access before. There's a lot of worry about AI disrupting jobs. I believe that there's going to be massive job creation, but some job categories are going to be deeply disrupted. We're doing our part, but I think governments and companies are going to have a big role as well. AI gives us superpowers to be even more creative. So this notion that humans will just tap out, like, “Oh, we're done,” doesn't resonate with me at all. There's a fear circulating that AI is going to wipe out humanity. Would you ever consider becoming CEO of the whole company? Let's be very clear: What Sam does, I cannot do. There's so much to do just on my scope that I think I have a decade or more of things that I can do just right there. And I'm telling you, we need all of us.
