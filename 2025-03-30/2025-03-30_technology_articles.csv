Apple is developing a new version of its Health app that includes an AI coach that can advise users on how to get healthier, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

Gurman first reported that something like this was in the works back in 2023, but now he says development is moving ahead, with the new features potentially coming as soon as spring or summer of 2026, with the release of iOS 19.4.

The AI coach’s advice would be based on data from across users’ medical devices, and would reportedly include food tracking. The coach is currently being trained on data from staff physicians, with Apple looking to bring in additional doctors to record health-related videos.

Project Mulberry was previously codenamed Project Quartz, and Gurman says it’s taken “many twists and turns” while “roping in” other parts of Apple, most notably (and perhaps most recently) Apple Intelligence. It’s nearing completion, however, and could ship as soon as one year from now as part of iOS 19.4.

As a new version of the Apple Health app, Project Mulberry will collect data from multiple Apple devices–iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods–plus third-party devices and the AI coach will use that to make personalized recommendations about ways you can improve your health. Apple is training this AI using “data from physicians that it has on staff,” Gurman says, and it will bring in more outside doctors and other experts to record videos about specific health topics that will be used in the app.

Other features include food tracking, camera-based workout assessments. And it’s possible–I’d say likely–that this will also result in a subscription serviced called Health+, Gurman says.

In related news, Gurman says Apple is now testing an M5-based iPad Pro internally and plans to ship it later this year, with M5-based MacBook Pro and Air models to follow. There are also M6 versions of its in-house modem chips, which will land in 2027. But closer to now, you can expect iOS 18.4 and its other associated software releases this coming week.",techmeme

Apple’s efforts in the health segment are a class ahead of the competition. But more than just racing ahead with innovation, the company has taken a more holistic approach that focuses on deep collaboration with experts, thorough validation, and long-term collaboration with its user community on medical studies.

The new hearing aid facility on AirPods is one such fresh specimen of Apple’s efforts. Then you have features like fall detection, looking for signs of non-rhythmic heart activity, and more. The next big bet from Apple could be an AI agent that acts like a doctor and might arrive as early as next year.

What to expect from an Apple AI coach?

As per the report, Apple is targeting a wide release of this system with the iOS 19.4 update, which is currently lined up for a release in the Spring or Summer season next year. The idea is ambitious at Apple’s scale, though not entirely novel.

Essentially, all the activity and wellness data collected in the Health app will be assessed by an AI coach. Based on this data, the AI health assistant will offer personalized recommendations. Back in 2024, Google launched a “Personal AI” within the Fitbit ecosystem that will offer actionable insights based on lifestyle patterns and workouts.

Last year, an upstart named ExerRing also introduced a smart ring that puts an AI coach on your fingers. The Circular Ring 2, which promises ECG measurement and blood pressure sensing, also brings an AI coach to the table via the connected mobile app.

Fitting nicely with the future hardware upgrades

In Apple’s case, expectedly, the efforts are far more expansive. “The company is currently training the AI agent with data from physicians that it has on staff. Apple is also looking to bring in outside doctors, including experts in sleep, nutrition, physical therapy, mental health and cardiology, to create videos,” says the Bloomberg report.

As far as utility goes, let’s say the Apple Watch detects a spike in heart rate. The Health app will log it, and then show a video from a doctor on how to best move ahead. Apple will offer a similar convenience tied to food and dietary assistance.

The AI agent will also take a peek at users exercising through their phone’s camera, and will offer insights and suggestions in real-time. This could tie well into Apple’s plans of AirPods with an onboard camera, and a similar hardware upgrade for the Apple Watch.",techmeme

This upcoming device could debut as early as Fall 2025, potentially marking it as one of the first products in Apple’s portfolio to be equipped with the M5 series processor.

The 2024 iPad Pro marked a significant milestone in Apple’s hardware evolution, introducing the M4 chip ahead of its rollout to Mac devices.

RelatedStories No Content Available

Earlier this year, the M4 series refresh was extended to the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Studio models, establishing a foundation for the next leap in Apple Silicon: the M5 chip.

Despite the relatively recent debut of the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips late last year, Apple seems poised to unveil the baseline M5 processor later this year, with higher-performance variants like the M5 Pro, M5 Max, and M5 Ultra expected to follow.

Code-named models reach late testing stages

The forthcoming iPad Pro has emerged as a prime candidate for showcasing this next-generation silicon. According to Bloomberg, internally code-named models “J817, J818, J820, and J821” have reached late testing stages, with production anticipated in the second half of 2025.

Apple’s next-generation iPad Pro is not expected to feature significant design changes. The 2024 model introduced a sleek new look, reduced camera count, and an innovative keyboard accessory. However, the spotlight this year will likely shine on advancements in hardware and software.

The M5 chip is anticipated to use a cutting-edge 3nm process, incorporating ARM’s next-generation CPU architecture to deliver enhanced performance and energy efficiency.

Software innovation will also take center stage, especially as Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) approaches. Scheduled for June 9-13, the conference will introduce key updates to Apple’s software ecosystem and possibly provide a sneak peek into the new iPad Pro’s capabilities.

What you should know

In addition to the 2025 iPad Pro, Apple is reportedly preparing M5-powered MacBook Pro models for launch later this year.

Meanwhile, an M5 refresh for the MacBook Air is said to be in development and could potentially arrive in 2026.

Apple’s WWDC 2025 promises to be an exciting event for developers and technology enthusiasts alike.

The keynote presentation, slated for June 9, will unveil Apple’s latest software updates and new product announcements. Like in previous years, the event will be held primarily online, with select in-person components, including the keynote and “State of the Union” presentation.

https://techmeme.com,2025 M5 MacBook Pro will be a “chip-and-ship” update; major redesign due in 2026,https://www.idownloadblog.com/2025/03/30/apple-macbook-pro-redesign-2026-rumor/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","The long-anticipated redesign of Apple’s MacBook Pro laptop won’t arrive before 2026, as this year’s models will only get faster M5 chips and nothing else.

Mark Gurman wrote in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter for Bloomberg that new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are being prepared for a launch later this year. The laptops will run the unreleased Apple M5 Pro and Apple M5 Max chips that will likely be announced alongside the new MacBook Pros.

Nothing else will be changed. In Apple talk, this is called a “chip-and-ship” update. The term refers to a type of device refresh where you mostly put in a faster chip and maybe update the color finish, with no other hardware changes.

2025 M5 MacBook Pro said to be a “chip-and-ship” update

“In other M5-related news, the MacBook Pro is a lock to get the chip later this year,” Gurman wrote. “It will probably happen around the same time of year that it received the M4 processor in 2024 and the M3 in 2023.” The laptop is expected to look the same overall as the M3 and M4-based MacBook Pro.

Gurman didn’t say whether the laptop would include an onboard cellular modem or whether there would be versions with and without a built-in modem for 5G cellular connectivity. Having a built-in modem would enable the laptop to maintain internet connectivity even if there are no Wi-Fi networks to hop on to.

Plus, the laptop could function as a wireless hotspot for other devices, similar to the iPhone’s Personal Hotspot feature. If Apple uses the C1 or its successor in the 2026 MacBook Pro, the laptop will also feature satellite connectivity and GPS.

Gurman also mentioned that we should see another “chip-and-ship” upgrade in the form of an M5-powered MacBook Air later this year, probably in October. There should also be an M5-focused upgrade to the iPad Pro this year, and the company is allegedly already developing an M6 iPad Pro for a launch in 2026. A twelfth-generation iPad with a faster chip is allegedly also in the works.

A major MacBook Pro redesign is due in 2026

Apple usually times significant product redesigns around major technological changes. Case in point: The iPhone X was the first Apple smartphone featuring a fullscreen design, dedicated facial unlocking hardware and an OLED display panel. Apple has been rumored to bring OLED to the MacBook Pro for some time, but Gurman’s report indicates this won’t happen this year.

And that’s not a surprise. The iPhone X redesign happened in 2017, on the iPhone’s tenth anniversary. Apple launched the first MacBook Air in 2006, so the laptop will celebrate its twentieth anniversary in 2026.

Earlier rumors calling for a significant MacBook Pro redesign this year were wrong. According to the latest rumor calling for a MacBook Pro redesign in 2026, the improvements should include bright OLED-based displays replacing mini-LED backlight in the current MacBook Pro, a custom cellular modem and a revamped appearance as the machine is expected to be visibly thinner thanks to OLED instead of mini-LED. It’s unclear whether the laptop will have a touch-sensitive display that Gurman previously called for.",techmeme

This week's Bloomberg Power On newsletter by Mark Gurman sheds light on some intriguing Apple plans. As Gurman suggests, Apple allegedly wants to ""replicate"" your doctor with an AI agent. This AI agent will monitor your data to give tailor-made health recommendations.

Apple's alleged Project Mulberry contains a revamped Health app and an AI agent. The goal is to fulfill the company's goal of putting a ""medical lab on your wrist"" and further reinforce Apple's greatest contribution to society, which is health care, according to Tim Cook.

Apple's revamped Health app, as Gurman explains, will gather data from your various devices (like iPhone, Apple Watch, and earbuds) and feed that data to the AI agent to produce tailor-made recommendations based on your health condition.

Physicians hired by Apple currently train the AI agent, and the firm is also looking to hire outside doctors like sleep experts, nutrition, physical therapists, mental health, and cardiology to create video content for the revamped Health app. The video content informs users about their current health status and associated risks.

If everything goes according to plan, the AI agent and the all-new health app will be released with iOS 19.4, which is due to roll out in the spring or summer of next year.

""Apple is opening up a facility near Oakland, California, that will let the physicians shoot their video content for the app. It's also seeking to find a major doctor personality to serve as a host of sorts for the new service, which some within Apple have tentatively dubbed ""Health+.""

The revamped Health app will focus more on food tracking, while the AI agent will also offer nutrition features to users. Moreover, Apple is experimenting with the idea of using the iPhone's rear camera to monitor users' workouts and give pointers to improve their technique through the AI agent. The feature could be a part of the Apple Fitness+ platform.",techmeme

Still, the iPhone maker wants to do more when it comes to health.

As of right now, Apple devices keep track of various health metrics such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and calories burned, but that data is just collected. The company does appear to have a plan to make use of that health data with the help of AI.

Apple wants its Health app, which tracks those health metrics, to offer AI coaching to improve your health, according to a report from Bloomberg.

This new strategy, reportedly referred to as Project Mulberry or Health+ among employees, is underway at the company, with doctors brought in to train AI agents. These doctors and other experts are also making videos to explain certain health issues and what can be done to improve them, the report says. The goal of this project is to have an AI coach that can look at all the health data collected from the various Apple and third-party devices to give recommendations on how to improve a user's health.

Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on this new health project.

AirPods and health

The Apple Watch was the company's primary way of gathering health metrics. That could be changing in the future with the AirPods being its next health-tracking device.

Apple reportedly wants its earbuds to have heart-rate monitoring, temperature sensing, and other sensors in order to gather more data on the user. The company also filed paperwork for a patent to have the AirPods keep track of other fitness metrics, such as how steadily a person walks and their breathing patterns, in order to determine if a person has a possible health ailment.

These plans for the AirPods are still a long way from happening, if they ever do.

Apple still needs to figure out AI.

AI, however, is the feature Apple is currently wrestling with. The company revealed its big endeavor into AI with Apple Intelligence when it unveiled the iPhone 16 last September. The rollout for Apple Intelligence, however, has yet to meet the standard the company is known for.

Even though Apple Intelligence ""launched"" not long after the release of the latest iPhone, the features Apple showed off have been slowly trickling out. Currently, Apple Intelligence can do certain functions like summarizing notifications, offering smart replies for texts, and cleaning up photos that a user may not want anymore, but it's still lagging behind.

Most notably, the big integration of AI into Siri to give the assistant an overhaul to become a true AI assistant has yet to materialize. Apple scrapped its plans for this smarter Siri and has plans to release the updated assistant sometime next year. This change also led to a shake-up within Apple, as the head of the team that developed the Vision Pro VR headset has reportedly been put in charge of the Siri team.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman today said the new design project is codenamed ""Solarium"" internally. A solarium is a room with glass walls that allow in plenty of sunlight, so this codename further hints at iOS 19 having a ""glass-like"" appearance with translucent interfaces. The new design is expected to look similar to visionOS for the Apple Vision Pro.

Jon Prosser has shared alleged renders of iOS 19's Camera and Messages apps on his YouTube channel Front Page Tech, and both apps have more translucent designs. However, there is some debate over the extent of the design changes.

Gurman previously claimed that iOS 19 could have the biggest design changes since iOS 7 introduced a much flatter appearance in 2013.

Apple's annual developers conference WWDC returns on Monday, June 9 this year. The first iOS 19 beta should be made available to developers for testing immediately following the opening keynote that day, and the software update should be released to the general public in September.

Apple first introduced its new in-house modems in the recently-released iPhone 16e. It was dubbed C1, and it was certainly a competitive entry into the market. It does lack mmWave though, and Apple is already working on future iterations to bring it up to flagship-levels.

According to Gurman, a future-generation iPad Pro with M6 will be taking the leap to Apple’s in-house modems. This’ll replace the Qualcomm modems currently used on cellular versions of the iPad Pro:

The company has also started early work on M6 versions with in-house modem chips, which are being targeted for 2027.

Despite this M6 iPad Pro being in the rumor cycle already, it actually isn’t the next iPad Pro. Apple is working on an M5 iPad Pro that’ll be as soon as later this year, likely October, according to Gurman.

The new project, dubbed Project Mulberry (originally it was called Project Quartz), includes a built-in AI health coach that aims to offer personal health advice, similar to what a real doctor might provide.

This AI coach will use data from devices like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and even AirPods to give tips on how users can improve their health — from sleep and exercise to nutrition and mental wellness. Apple has been training the AI with help from in-house doctors and plans to bring in outside specialists to create video content that explains different health conditions and lifestyle changes.

Apple is even building a studio near Oakland, California, where these doctors can film videos for the app. The company also wants to find a well-known medical expert to serve as the face of the new service, which some inside Apple are calling “Health+.”

One major focus will be food tracking, something Apple hasn’t really done before. The new tools are expected to compete with apps like MyFitnessPal and Noom. The AI coach will help users track meals and offer nutrition advice.

Apple is also looking into ways to use the iPhone’s camera to watch workouts and suggest better form or technique—possibly connecting this with its existing Fitness+ platform.

The project is led by Dr. Sumbul Desai, who runs Apple’s health team, and is backed by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams.

Other generative AI chatbots can already give you health advice if you ask for it (even through voice conversations like Grok or ChatGPT), while scouring the web for the latest data.

And, sticking to its regular upgrade cycle, Apple also will refresh the MacBook Pro lineup with the M5 chip later this year.

M5 iPad Pro in late-stage internal testing at Apple

Last May, Apple gave its iPad Pro lineup a major upgrade. The devices debuted with a thinner design and a beautiful new Tandem OLED display. And in an unusual move, Apple also used the new Pro iPads as the debut device for its M4 chip. It seems the company might continue that trend this year.

Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman, in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, says Apple is in the late stages of testing the M5 iPad Pros, code-named J817, J820 and J821. They reportedly will enter mass production in the second half of 2025 and could go on sale in late Q3 or early Q4. This would align with Apple’s 18-month refresh cycle for its flagship iPads.

Mostly a minor spec bump

Considering the M4 iPad Pro introduced significant design changes, the M5 upgrade likely will be all about a spec bump.

A previous rumor indicated Apple’s next-gen M5 chip entered mass production earlier this year. TSMC will fabricate it on its N3P node, a minor upgrade over its current 3nm fab. This will result in only a 5% boost in performance and a modest 5% to 10% gain in efficiency.

Gurman’s sources also indicate Apple is already testing the M6 iPad Pro with the company’s in-house modem. These next-gen tablets reportedly will debut in 2027.

M5 MacBook Pros coming later in 2025

Alongside the new iPads, Apple will upgrade its MacBook Pro lineup with the M5 chip “later this year,” according to Gurman. The new models should go official in late October, sticking to the company’s usual timeline of unveiling new Macs.

However, don’t expect 2025 MacBook Pros to incorporate any major changes. Gurman thinks that won’t happen until 2026 with the M6 refresh.",techmeme

These devices are likely to launch in fall 2025, coming after the May 2024 release of the M4-powered iPad Pro models.

The M5 chip is being made using TSMC’s 3-nanometer process and promises big improvements in performance and energy efficiency compared to earlier versions. It is also expected to enhance AI capabilities and overall functionality, which could be especially useful for Apple’s Vision Pro devices as well as iPads and MacBooks.

Apple has also started early work on M6-powered devices, which are planned to add in-house modem chips by 2027. This step marks Apple’s probable move away from Qualcomm modems, as the company hopes to give users better technology with its own silicon by that time.

It is capable of analyzing complex information with contextual nuance to draw logical conclusions with more accuracy than ever.

As users have come to expect, this new model was initially exclusive for those willing to pay $20 per month for Gemini Advanced membership. But less than a week later, Google has surprised everyone by making it immediately available to free users too.

Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking off 🚀🚀🚀The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap.Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today.Try it at no… https://t.co/eqCJwwVhXJMarch 29, 2025

“The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap,” the official Gemini App X account wrote in a thread justifying the move. “Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today.”

With plenty of Advanced subscribers responding to the post asking what exactly they’re paying for if free users get access to the new model too, the official account stressed that Advanced users still get the better experience. Not only do they get a “longer context window”, but “free users have rate limits on this model, which do not apply to Advanced users”.

The official documentation does indeed make it clear that power users will want a paid account. For the Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental model, Advanced subscribers get four times the requests per minute (20 vs 5) and Requests per day (100 vs 25), as well as double the number of tokens per minute (2 million instead of 1 million).

While Gemini’s 2.5 model hasn’t even been available for a week yet, it is already impressing. It’s at the top of the LMArena leaderboard, leapfrogging ChatGPT 4o, and beating its rivals on math, creative writing and science benchmarks. It does, however, lag behind its Open AI rival in terms of coding and following multi-turn exchanges.

Impressively, Gemini 2.5 achieved a score of 18.8% on Humanity’s Last Exam — a test designed to push AI’s use of complex knowledge to the limit — putting it ahead of Open AI o3-mini (14%), GPT-4.5 (6.4%), Claude 3.7 Sonnet (8.9%) and DeepSeek R1 (8.6%).

Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking off 🚀🚀🚀 The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap. Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today. Try it at no… https://t.co/eqCJwwVhXJ — Google Gemini App (@GeminiApp) March 29, 2025

Gemini 2.5 Pro is the most advanced version of the Gemini models to date with a particular emphasis on coding, math, and science capabilities. As with previous Pro models, Gemini 2.5 Pro will “show” its thoughts and reasoning as it works through your queries.

Per Google’s blog post, “With Gemini 2.5, we’ve achieved a new level of performance by combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training. Going forward, we’re building these thinking capabilities directly into all of our models, so they can handle more complex problems and support even more capable, context-aware agents.”

Gemini 2.5 Pro beats the competition in most areas by a significant margin, particularly in terms of code editing. Based on the Aider Polyglot test, Gemini scored 74% compared to the next-highest score of 64.9% from Claude 3.7, and it’s long-context understanding far outstripped OpenAI’s models.

Google says it will add pricing in the coming weeks for users that want to use Gemini 2.5 Pro on a more enterprise level and require higher rate limits.

Google Unveils Gemini 2.5 Pro for All Users – No Subscription Required

Gemini 2.5 Pro was released earlier this week and is being called Google’s smartest AI model yet. The new version comes with several improvements, including better reasoning abilities. It also introduces new features like app and browser extensions, file uploads, and integration with Google’s Canvas collaboration tool. These updates make the model more versatile and capable of handling a wider range of tasks.

In the past, only paying subscribers had access to Gemini 2.5 Pro. Google decided to make it free for all users in an effort to let more people explore its cutting-edge technology. The goal is to allow users to experience the AI’s enhanced performance and provide feedback that can help improve it further.

Gemini 2.5 Pro is now available on the official Gemini website. It will also be available on the Gemini app for Android and iOS soon. Along with this release, Google has updated the Gemini app to improve the user experience. The update makes it easier for users to select and remember which version of the Gemini model they are using.

Despite still being in the experimental phase, Gemini 2.5 Pro has already shown impressive performance. It supports app integrations, file uploads, and works well with the Canvas tool. The model also features a context window of 1 million tokens, allowing it to process large amounts of data and maintain consistency in long conversations. Google plans to expand the token limit to 2 million in the future to improve memory capacity and performance.

Gemini 2.5 Pro is already ranked at the top of the LMArena benchmarks. Google is also working on improving its ability to handle code, making it even more powerful for developers.

https://techmeme.com,Ethereum's time is 'meow?' Vitalik Buterin vid goes 'vrial',https://crypto.news/ethereums-meow-vitalik-buterin-video-greeted-derision/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 06:55:59 GMT","Some commentators on X called it “sad.” Others used expletives. Either way, a video of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin went viral and not in a good way.

The crypto community on X.com, rarely known for decorum, blasted Buterin for kneeling before a robot and emitting what sounds like a “meow” sound.

To some, the video underscored why one needs to be “bullish” about Ethereum’s present and future. To others, it was worthy of a Studio Ghibli-style photo edit. Most people kept scrolling. See below.

https://twitter.com/Philfog/status/1905634153535541262

In the brief clip, Buterin pats the robot on the head after making the unusual sound. While he has yet to comment on the video, the moment has ignited chatter, particularly given Ether’s recent price struggles.

As of publication, Ether has dropped nearly 55% since reclaiming the $4,000 mark in December 2024, now trading at $1,833 — down over 8% in the past week.

Some crypto figures have expressed concern, with commentator “The Count of Monte Crypto” humorously noting that the state of Ether’s price was more worrying than Buterin’s quirky behavior.

And when Buterin tried posting about “how to fund public goods,” he was trolled by the crypto community with statements like: “NO ONE F–KING CARE[S]” and “YOU ARE THE ONLY FOUNDER THAT IS DOING 0 APART FROM DUMPING YOUR AIRDROPS! WAKE UP VITALIK.”

It’s noteworthy that Buterin has long been known for being quirky and, according to a recent Bloomberg feature, “monkish.”

But his behavior occasionally invites scrutiny. Iggy Azalea, for example, dissed Buterin for singing at TOKEN2049 in Singapore, calling it “loser s—.”

Buterin is also not clear-cut in his political affiliation, which is somewhat refreshing for today’s polarized crypto traders. He has spoken openly against former SEC chair Gary Gensler as well as the dangers of “large-scale political coins” — seemingly a critique at Trump.

Indeed, many crypto leaders have embraced Trump’s pro-crypto stance, but Buterin has distanced himself, rejecting what he called the “bronze-aged mindset” favored by some in the crypto community.

With Ether facing uncertain prospects and Buterin’s actions fueling speculation, it remains unclear whether his personal brand of decentralization or his refusal to align with Trump’s crypto-friendly policies will shape Ethereum’s path forward.",techmeme

Ethereum Price Continues Its Steep Decline

According to CoinMarketCap data, technicals for Ethereum’s price are grim, with the second-largest cryptocurrency slipping below $1,900. At press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,828 and shows no signs of reversing the grim trend.

A look at Ethereum’s chart does not indicate any signs of an uptrend or a short bounce to stoke embers of optimism. According to pseudonymous analyst Gum, Ethereum signals “relentless downward price action” that could see the asset fall below $1,800.

Over the last day, Ethereum has fallen by nearly 4% while its seven-day chart indicates a decline of nearly 8%. The decline of Ethereum price follows a broader market correction with the global crypto market capitalization losing nearly 3% of its valuation.

On the fundamentals side, things are equally grim for the Ethereum price. Unconfirmed reports of a potential Binance delisting ETH threaten to send Ethereum price to $1,500. Standard Chartered has slashed its ETH prediction for 2025 by 60%, projecting $4,000 as a potential price point by the end of the year.

Expert Says Network Has Itself To Blame

Ryan Watkins, co-founder at Syncracy Capital has taken swipes at Ethereum over its failure to keep pace with its peers. Watkins notes that a failure to capitalize on previous momentum during the last two market cycles is haunting Ethereum’s price.

Ethereum has fallen down the pecking order to new blockchains with Solana and Bitcoin tipped to have the upper hand over the network. An inflow of bridged funds from Ethereum to Solana is accentuating the network’s worrying metrics.

“No one wants to own a growth stage product that’s falling behind technologically superior competitors and bleeding market share,” said Watkins.

Watkins says the only for Ethereum to pull itself from the rut is to “deliver generational leadership and growth.” However, with the Pectra upgrade around the corner, enthusiasts are optimistic that Ethereum can reach $10,000. Hardcore community members are poking holes in Solana’s rise, attributing it a memecoin craze compared to Ethereum’s neck-deep foray into decentralized finance (DeFi).

https://theverge.com,"We went to 10 anti-Tesla protests — and a couple counter protests, too",https://theverge.com/tesla/639183/tesla-takedown-protest-march-29-elon-musk-doge,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 03:17:44 GMT","Thousands of anti-Tesla protesters took to the streets Saturday March 29th in opposition to Elon Musk and his efforts with DOGE to eliminate humanitarian aid, close federal agencies, and fire government workers. It was the culmination of nearly two months of steady, almost daily demonstrations aimed at hurting Tesla’s sales — and ultimately Musk himself. Today was billed as a “Global Day of Action” with protests targeting hundreds of Tesla locations in the US, Canada, and Europe.

The Verge wanted to check the temperature and see how these protesters were thinking about this current moment, and whether they felt their boycott was having its desired effect. Tesla sales have slid significantly since the protests started, and its stock has shed a lot of its value. But Musk shows no signs of being deterred, as he ramps up his threats to sic the government on anti-Tesla forces.

So we fanned out across the globe, from London to New York to Washington, DC to Los Angeles — and Paramus, NJ and Akron, Ohio too — to observe the movement as it enters it third month and talk to the people who opted to spend a good chunk of a Saturday afternoon waving signs and shouting about Musk and Tesla. We even saw several counter protesters who came out to support Musk — and Tesla.

Here’s what we saw:

London:

London’s Tesla Takedown protest was a small affair, with 50-odd protestors, one dinosaur, and an inflatable Elon making that salute all perched outside a Tesla showroom in Park Royal, a neighborhood otherwise dominated by big box retailers, self-storage units, and ghost kitchens. But it’s come a long way since its humble beginnings six weeks ago, when it was just two protestors getting “kicked out of the Westfield shopping mall by security,” according to organizer John Gorenfeld.

Gorenfeld is a Californian, but this protest was English to a fault: polite, peaceful, and a little quiet. There was no police presence, and nor was one needed; even a Tesla pulling in didn’t attract much ire from the crowd. Fortunately, passing drivers were there to provide the noise — a “Honk If You Hate Elon” sign was answered by a chorus of cars, trucks, and at least one city bus. Londoners may not have come out in force, but it’s pretty clear where the city’s sympathies lie.

Washington, DC:

On a busy shopping street in Georgetown, DC, protesters are dancing outside a Tesla showroom to everything from “Hot to go,” to “Under Pressure,” to the viral TikTok hostile takeover song. They’re wearing a mix of shiny boas, boat captain hats, and floral shirts. The loosely boat-themed dance party has been attracting a steady stream of honks from passing cars, and many pedestrians are stopping to gleefully take pictures. “Nazi cars sold here,” says one sign, “Porsche = fast, Ferrari = faster, Tesla = fascist,” says another.

“Part of how fascism operates is they want people to be fearful,” says Sara Steffens, part of a team that calls themselves Dance Against DOGE. Steffens dons a floral outfit and a captain’s hat that she says symbolizes how the people are in charge of their destiny, rather than Trump and Musk. “Bullies operate on fear and they want us to be afraid of them … so this is like a full force showing.”

The mix of attendees appears to span many ages, and one of the groups rallying older generations to get involved is Third Act. Mark, an attendee affiliated with Third Act who declined to give his last name, said it was important to be at the protest “as someone with two grandchildren, trying to do something so that they can grow up in a place that’s safe.”

Paramus, New Jersey:

Cruise down Route 17 in north New Jersey and you’ll see a ton of car dealerships. But for the past few weeks, none have seen quite as much action as the Tesla dealership near Paramus. Each weekend, protestors of all ages have been holding up signs at the side of the highway, encouraging drivers to sell their Teslas, dump their stock, and honk against fascism. Today, the vibe is a little different.

The pro-Trumpers are here too — and the lines are clearly drawn.

“Last week, it was just us here,” says Ethan, a protester wearing a Super Mario Bros. Luigi cap and holding a sign that reads “Cyberfucked.” “Now all these Trump guys are here, walking around, doing whatever they want.”

Ethan, who declined to give his last name, says he’s been hassled by the Trump and Musk supporters. They’ve called him slurs, thrown water at him, and tried to grab his sign before a fellow protestor calmed the situation down. He says one Trump supporter told him his Luigi hat was offensive to Italian Americans. When I ask Ethan why he’s here today, he says “Because I fucking hate Elon Musk.” Then after a bit of thought, he adds, “We’re kind of screwed. It might not be much, but I want to at least say something and be heard by someone.”

On the other side, the Trump camp isn’t as concerned about holding up signs. They’re more milling about, grouping off into mini clusters. (They do, however, have many signs that read “Thank you Elon” and “Trump won.”) When I ask to speak to the organizer, I’m directed to John Tabacco — who wears a light blue blazer with prints of President Trump’s face.

“We need to show that there is support for what Elon Musk and DOGE is doing,” Tabacco says. He also takes issue when I characterize the pro-Trump crowd as a counterprotest. “This is a rally for us. A support rally for Trump, DOGE, and America-first policies. And I think those people,” he says, pointing to the anti-Tesla group, “Those people showed up today as counter-protesters.”

Akron, Ohio:

Tesla service center here is closed on weekends. It’s just off Route 18, at an intersection that services a shopping center with a Home Depot, Chick-fil-A, a local bar chain called The Winking Lizard, and more. The turnout is surprising, about 40-50 people (and two very good dogs) are lined up on both sides of the street waving signs and ringing cowbells. There’s a man with a bullhorn rousing the crowd with slogans, “When immigrants are under attack, what do we do?” he yells. “Fight back!” The crowd responds.

There’s a variety of people here, including a lot more gray and white hair folks using scooters and wheelchairs. A woman in a high-visibility vest said she and a lot of the older people here came on behalf of Third Act Ohio, an activist group for folks over 60. It’s hard to hear her as people continuously drive by, honking their horns in support.

Austin, Texas:

Walnut Creek, California:

Arriving 20 minutes before the event, it was quiet, even though organizers were expecting the crowd to be large, with last week’s attendance estimated around 1,300. They were right. Within ten minutes the plaza was full of attendees with a diversity of signage ranging from “Deport Elon Musk”, “Stop the Attack on Democracy”, “Hands off our Social Security” plus many others.

Even though the crowd is large, organizers emphasize their message over the speakers; this is a peaceful non-violent protest. This is similar to what one of the organizers told me as well, “Despite what the administration is saying, we’re not domestic terrorists, we are absolutely peaceful, nonviolent, we provide guidance and say no harassment of the Tesla showroom. We just want to make our voices heard.”

Alice Grimm said this is about bringing down the power of the billionaire. “From Elon Musk’s perspective, any dollar that doesn’t go to him is wasted and efficiency is whatever fills his pocket. And so Tesla, where most of his wealth is, if what he cares about is that element, then trying to drive down the stock price of Tesla, that attacks Elon’s power.”

— Victoria Barrios

Long Beach and Lakewood, California:

“I was on my way to another anti-Elon protest,” a woman named Nati said, while holding two signs at a Supercharger location in Lakewood. “I had to stop here when I saw everyone out.”

As Tesla owners pulled in and out, around 100 people stood on the sidewalk protesting. Most Tesla owners remained in their cars or went into nearby stores, largely avoiding the large crowd chanting, “This is what Democracy looks like,” and waving at passing cars that honked in support.

A man who asked to be identified as Sam set up a folding table and sold anti-Musk and Trump goods to passersby, though most at the Supercharger had brought their own homemade signs and wore shirts with “Gulf of Mexico,” and “Biden Harris,” emblazoned on them.

“I was on my way to another anti-Elon protest. I had to stop here when I saw everyone out.”

At a Tesla dealership a few miles away, in Long Beach, around 250 people lined the sidewalks on both sides of a busy four-lane road near a Home Depot and Costco that is packed on the weekends. As drivers drove past, people honked, cheered, and pumped their fists out their car windows, showing support.

The protests in Long Beach were peaceful, with protestors remaining on public property, cheering as people honked in support, but a tiny number of Trump and Musk supporters did show up to troll the crowds.

At the Supercharger location, a family decided to engage the protesters, yelling that they were “stupid. ” Their young daughter, who looked to be around ten years old, screamed profanities at the protesters. A pair of police SUVs were parked across the street, keeping an eye on things, and one lone Musk supporter lingered nearby holding a sign thanking Musk.

An anti-Tesla protester who asked not to be identified said that she’d been at another protest in Long Beach in late February when a truck driver rolled down his window and tried to pepper spray the protesters. No one was hurt, but the woman said that it did concern her. “You just don’t know how people are going to respond to exercising your right to free speech,” she said.

New York City, New York:

Hundreds of protesters marched and chanted in front of a Tesla showroom in the Meatpacking District in New York City. The mood was lively and enthusiastic as protesters waved signs, danced in flaming cardboard Cybertruck costumes, and smashed toy cars on the sidewalk with a hammer. A moment of silence was held for a large portion of the crowd to lay down on the street with cardboard signs shaped like gravestones to stage a “die in” in front of the Tesla showroom.

The protest was peaceful but there were two separate instances where protesters started shouting out for others not to engage with two men holding out microphones and asking questions. In the second instance of this, police that were surrounding the building came over to prevent one of these interviewers from engaging with the protesters. The man being escorted out of the crowd still held a microphone, walked backwards smiling and said “crackhead, come here” gesturing towards one of the protesters for an interview.

New York City. Photo: Owen Grove / The Verge

Slogans on signs varied in intensity. One sign depicted Elon Musk dressed as Emperor Palpatine that read, “Strike down Darth Ketamine, Congress must!!!” Another banner held by a group of three protesters read, “Burn A Tesla Save Democracy.”

Aside from some raised voices, there weren’t any violent altercations. The turnout at this protest was about three times larger than the protest at the same location a week earlier. As the protest neared its end there were chants of “we’ll be back” from the crowd. They were ready to come back for more.

The Drop

Screen share

Marina Galperina joined The Verge a few weeks ago as a senior tech editor and immediately started asking extremely fun questions. Questions like, “shouldn’t we do a thing about bird flu?” And “did you know that I once sold a Vine at an art fair?” (And “David, why are all your sentences so bad?”) What I’m saying is, she fit right in.

Marina’s been covering tech and science for a while, but I wasn’t sure if she was a true gadget-head or not. So I asked Marina to share her homescreen with us, to see if I could figure it out. Here it is, plus some info on the apps she uses and why:

The phone: iPhone 14 Pro. The screen is kind of crushed, but generally, it’s a fine device and actually fits in my hand!

The wallpaper: It’s a Gothko! Mark Rothko’s Untitled (Black on Gray) that I saw at the Guggenheim years ago. It took me a minute to find the real one online, because before, I used to have to only worry about images of “Rothko-style” copycat prints, and now it’s all this AI garbage stinking up search results. I wanted that specific black on gray thing.

The apps: Way of Life, Photos, Apple Notes, Messenger, Google Sheets, Camera, Signal, Clock, Momence, Apple Fitness, Expense, Google Maps, Slack, YouTube, WhatsApp, Hue, Pocket, Chase, Bluesky, Messages, Phone, Safari, Gmail.

Clearly, I’m really into gamified fitness right now. The Verge’s Victoria Song turned me onto both Apple Fitness and Ladder, and I’m sort of oscillating between the two. I only still have Twitter as an occupational hazard. Otherwise it would be gone. The best (only good?) social network is Letterboxd.

Way of Life — I should explain that one, because it sounds like a cult manual. It’s just a very simple habit tracker that doesn’t just count multiple streaks but generates handy little graphs and charts to visualize your W v. L day ratios. Gamify everything.

I also asked Marina to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she sent back:

I enjoyed reading Acts of Desperation recently, by Megan Nolan — a good book about a bad relationship.

I’m still thinking about Companion even though I gave it only three stars on Letterboxd, but a solid three stars. More of an extended metaphor than a believable sci-fi flick, but satisfying.

I haven’t actually gamed much lately since I started this job, and I’m holding out for Silksong . Previously, I actually printed out a map of Hollow Knight on four sheets of paper taped together and crossed off the bosses as I beat them, which is kind of weird. I’m a completionist. I’ll play, like, one game at a time, but to death.

“As Formula 1 season begins, it’s worth mentioning that the best way of following the sport live or through replays for true F1 fans is by using the incredibly cool MultiViewer app. It enables you to use multiple streams and get live timing and tons of other data in real time. An F1 T V subscription is needed, and it also works for IndyCar, NASCAR and WEC.” – David

“This week, I discovered GetInvoice, a tool that extracts invoices and receipts from your emails and web portals. Has saved our company a huge amount of time for tax season.” – Miki

“Amazon’s lockdown of book downloads convinced me to download all my books from various services and put them on a self-hosted server, accessible from my Kobo. So thanks for the nudge, Bezos!” – Dan

“I wanted to recommend Lunatask, which might be the ultimate platform for life tracking. It works cross platform, and it is end-to-end encrypted. It has already replaced Todoist for me, but that’s not all: it also has a Notes tab, which can be connected to your calendar or tasks. It has a journaling space, a mood tracker, a habit tracker, and a relationships tracker (you can get reminders to reach out to your friends to maintain your real-life connections).” – Matin

“Among the many subscription-based meditation apps, there’s this lesser-known Healthy Minds Program, made by actual scientists and pretty customizable. You can pick your own meditation time for any specific lesson, for example. And it’s completely free.” – Liviu

“Been diving into ‘new’ Game Boy games after getting a ModRetro Chromatic. Besides the official games (my favorites are Dragonyhm and Hermano so far), there are a ton of polished games on itch.io and from other publishers. I had no idea.” – Justin

“I started using Runna to train for a local marathon and was impressed with its commitment to training plans. It gives off a far more serious vibe than Runkeeper (my previous favorite) or the Nike Run app, but it comes with a serious price tag. So far, I’m digging it — but skeptical it’s worth the $.” – Tyler

Signing off

I talk a lot in this newsletter about some of the things I care too much about. Note-taking apps, for one. Bad shows and movies about cool spies, to name another. But there’s one I don’t talk about much here, and that is my deep and abiding obsession with snacks. Like, I’m the guy who combs the blogs looking for the best finds at Trader Joe’s (Unexpected Cheddar Cheese Spread and the Elote Corn Chip Dippers, you’re welcome), and who will happily try any weird variety of Goldfish or Oreo just in case it’s amazing.

I say this because, one, I want you to send me snack recommendations, and two, I discovered Cabel Sasser’s annual snack roundups and, through them, have both found a ton of good snacks and a new love for snack-related content. Maybe Installer will one day just be about snacks. Or maybe I’m just hungry. Either way, I’m here for all of the internet’s snack content.

Rocket fell down - the company will try again as fast as possible

Listen to the matter

The short version The summary is made with artificial intelligence and quality assured by VG's journalists. Today, a rocket was fired from Andøya in Nordland.

This is the first time a rocket of this type is launched from both European and Norwegian soil.

It exploded after just over 30 seconds in the air.

It was unclear for a while whether this was the point or not.

Later, the company Andøya SpacePort, the place where the rocket was launched, set up, crisis after an ""incident"".

Just after 13.30, the general manager of Andøya Spaceport's parent company confirmed that this is a common procedure after such launches.

Police were out early and reported that there were no injuries.

The company behind the launch itself reports that it has been a great success.

Business Minister Cecilie Myrseth (Ap) calls the operation a ""milestone"", while the party Red asks for external investigation.

The purpose of firing rockets is, among other things, to obtain information, such as on weather and natural disasters. Show more

The unmanned rocket was in the air just over half a minute before it hit the ground and exploded. Isar Aerospace is the German company behind the launch of the rocket from Andøya Spaceport.

At 13.23, the company writes at X that they refer to the shooting as a great success:

""What a success! At 12:30 CEST, Isar Aerospace fired its launch vessel Spectrum successfully from Andøya Spaceport in Norway. The launch vessel was interrupted after about 30 seconds in the air, and the vessel fell straight into the sea. The launch platform appears to be intact, ”the company writes.

On Sunday afternoon at 16:30 the company held a press conference. There, ISAR chief and co-founder, Daniel Metzler, met and vice president of launch operations, Alexandre Dallonea.

- For a day! It has been very exciting. It was a success because we met all the goals for the launch, says Metzler.

- When I think about this, I get goosebumps, he continues and points to how far the company has come since they were a group of three students when it was founded in 2018.

Will try again as fast as possible

Metzler says he obviously dreamed that the rocket would reach space, but that the story indicates that it was always unlikely.

- We were unable to reach the room, but we learned a lot that will make us better prepared for the next launch.

-No aerospace companies have ever succeeded in their first launch.

See the full press conference:

Metzler thanks Andøya Spaceport, the Norwegian people and the Norwegian state for the support. He believes Isar Aerospace today has shown that Europe can also engage in innovation in aerospace.

- Europe needs to have the opportunity to send satellites to space. The rockets available today are already sold out over the next couple of years. As of now, the Chinese government takes the most rockets to space. Europe needs to be independent in this area.

Rocket number two and three are already in production, the entrepreneur says.

- We will try to shoot up rocket number two as soon as possible, but it is too early to say just when it will be.

Set crisis staff

The update from the company comes after Andøya Spaceport, the place where the rocket was launched, reported that a crisis staff had been set after an ""event"".

- Crisis staff has been set at Andøya Spaceport and we work with the emergency services and Isar Aerospace to get a complete overview of the situation, the company wrote in a press release.

Both the police and the municipality went out quickly and said no injuries were reported.

The reduction of crisis staff created complete confusion.

In the press release, Andøya Spaceport did not elaborate on what kind of event it was about. At this point, it was also unclear whether the rocket was intended to fall into the ground and explode after such a short time.

Rocket Company: Security Procedure

Shortly thereafter, Isar Aerospace sent out an update and stated that the test launch was interrupted after 30 seconds according to safety procedures.

Just after 13.30, VG was in contact with Ketil Olsen, general manager of Andøya Space - Andøya Spaceport's parent company.

He then said that it is quite natural to set crisis staff to be sure that you have control and overview of the situation after such launches.

Facing TV 2, Ingun Berget, general manager of Andøya Spaceport, clarifies what caused a crisis staff to be set:

- There was an incident that led us to set crisis staff. This incident was that the carrier rocket did not go where it was going and the launch was interrupted, says Berget to TV 2.

Now the crisis staff has dissolved, according to the company. Work is now underway to identify any environmental and material damage.

- enormous need

On the live broadcast from VG's collaboration newspaper Vesterålen online, you could see the rocket fly up before it lost the speed and fell to the ground.

This was the first launch of an orbital carrying rocket type rocket designed to carry payload, such as satellites, into a orbit around the earth. from the European mainland.

- Today was the first integrated test of all systems. The test has resulted in a ton of data from which the team can now evaluate and learn, it was said by the commentator at Isar Aerospace's live broadcast.

- Why is it important to send rockets in the room?

The question is asked to Professor at UiB and the leader of the Romosch group Kjellmar Oksavik, who answers:

- There is a huge need in the world to get satellites in the room. For example, to monitor the weather and be able to predict natural disasters.

Oksavik thinks it is an advantage if Europe manages this itself.

""It's almost just great powers like the United States, China, India, Russia who are able to send things in the room,"" he told VG.

Oksavik adds that the situation in the world means that Europe may not necessarily rely on other great powers in the future.

- huge success

Just after the launch, Professor Kjellmar Oksavik mentioned the following to TV 2:

""I want to say that this was a huge success, because nothing exploded on the shooting ramp, and it managed to get several hundred meters into the air,"" said Oksavik, who is the head of the space physics group, according to TV 2.

To the newspaper, the professor says that this experience can be used to get a longer flight next time:

- Although it exploded, it is a success. I know they're going to study this carefully and find out what's wrong so they get further next time. That's how you get to the room, Oksavik said.

Business Minister Cecilie Myrseth (Ap) is also impressed.

- This is a milestone for Norway as a space nation. I congratulate Isar Aerospace and Andøya Spaceport with a successful test launch, says Myrseth in a press release.

The party Red, on the other hand, is not impressed and has asked for external investigation of the launch.

- How close have we been a big accident or that life could have been lost? The other thing we need to clarify is the natural consequences, says parliamentary representative Geir Jørgensen (s) to NRK.",theverge

https://theverge.com,Samsung’s latest stick vac can alert you to calls and text messages,https://theverge.com/news/639078/samsung-bespoke-ai-jet-ultra-vacuum-text-messages,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 02:00:00 GMT","In our notification-heavy world, there is still one activity where you might just miss that buzz on your phone or ping on your smartwatch – while you’re vacuuming. Thankfully, Samsung has a solution.

Its newest cordless stick vac, the new Bespoke AI Jet Ultra ($1,099), now has an LCD display control panel that, along with standard features such as power level and battery life, can notify you when you have an incoming phone call or text message. The vacuum, which works with an auto-empty charging station, also features 400AW suction and 100-minute battery life.

Even better, if you’re doing the wash and left your phone in the other room, Samsung’s added touchscreens to its washers and dryers, including the new Bespoke AI Laundry Vented Combo washer / dryer ($3,099). This lets you answer a call directly on the built-in 7-inch LCD screen. The Combo can also (perhaps more usefully) put detergent in for you automatically and then, when the cycle is done, open its door.

The new Bespoke combo washer and dryer has several tech upgrades, including a new 7-inch touchscreen that you can make phone calls on. Image: Samsung

The company has been rolling out the ability to answer your phone from your appliance to its entire Bespoke AI line. At CES this year, Samsung showed off these AI Home control panels on several appliances, including its new Bespoke AI smart fridges and wall ovens. The features work with Android and iOS and require a Samsung account and the SmartThings app.

AI Home is a new terminology Samsung uses to refer to the 7- or 9-inch LCD screens on its products and the screens built into its flagship Family Hub smart fridge. The fridge now has the option of a slimmed-down screen that — like the other AI Home screens — includes music, weather, and cooking apps, and smart home controls.

Of course, you can still get the fridge with a giant 21.5-inch or 32-inch screen that can run even more apps, including Samsung TV and TikTok. These screens all also work as controls for the appliance and integrate with other Samsung appliances and services, sometimes using AI.

The flagship Samsung Family Hub smart fridge now comes with the option of a smaller screen.

For example, on the fridge screen, you can look up a recipe in the Samsung Food app using ingredients it has identified you have using its AI-powered cameras. You can then send the cooking instructions to your oven and use the screen to view the recipe. It’s like having your phone with you everywhere, except your hands are free.

The AI Home screens can connect to Samsung’s SmartThings smart home platform. That means you can get alerts on your appliances about other events in your smart home, for example, you can see (and talk to) whoever is at your Ring video doorbell while unloading the washer.

Samsung’s “screens everywhere” approach is part of its AI for the home push, its vision of tech working in the background to help you with your daily life. While the smart home has plenty of potential to save you time, money, and energy, putting screens into everything feels like overkill. A smart display could serve much of the same purpose, and would probably cost less to replace than a cooktop when you drop a pan on its screen.",theverge
https://theverge.com,The base iPad is finally being left behind,https://theverge.com/apple/636335/ipad-2025-11th-generation-review,"Sun, 30 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT","I can tell you the entire story of the 11th-generation iPad by explaining the results of one benchmarking test. It’s called Geekbench, and it’s a cross-platform tool that simulates a bunch of real-world activities to give each device a score that roughly approximates how powerful it is. It’s not perfect (no benchmark is), but it can be revealing. In this case, it shows off an iPad that is very good at the things iPads have always been good at, but it may be about to hit its limit — and definitely isn’t ready for what’s to come.

When you run a Geekbench CPU test on a device like the iPad, it tests both single-core and multicore performance. Most modern devices have multiple cores: the iPad’s A16 chip has five CPU cores and four GPU cores; the current iPad Pro has nine and 10, respectively; and you can spec the latest Mac Studio all the way up to 28 CPU cores and 60 GPU cores. Not all cores are created the same, and we could talk about this forever, but let’s not.

All you need to know is that a single-core process only does one thing at a time and is typically used for simple everyday computing tasks, like running your email app or refreshing your Spotify homepage. Multicore processes, on the other hand, are designed for when lots of things need to happen simultaneously, like when you’re editing video or creating a 3D model that needs to be built, rendered, and moved all at once. Again, there are few hard-and-fast rules to all this. But in general, the more cores you have, the more you can do at once.

Which brings me back to the scores. The new $349 base-model iPad’s scores are practically identical to last year’s M2-powered Air on single-core processes, and this year’s M3 Air only beats it by about 11 percent. This suggests that for most normal, simple iPad things, they should all perform about the same, which has been exactly my experience. Watching videos, browsing the web, swiping through photos — the M3 Air is occasionally a smidge smoother, but they’re all effectively identical.

On the multicore test, though, which measures the device’s ability to do lots of things at once, the base iPad gets absolutely trucked by its brethren. The M3 Air scored more than double the base iPad, and even last year’s M2 Air did 60 percent better on the tests. In Geekbench’s GPU test, which is focused specifically on the kind of intensive graphical processing you’ll care about in video games, editing apps, and powerful creativity tools, both Airs more than doubled the iPad.

What those numbers show is what my testing confirms: that the base iPad is still a lovely, fast, usable device for casual use. It’s an excellent Netflix machine, with an 11-inch screen and four speaker grilles (though only two actual speakers) that pump loud, if not fabulous, sound. It’s great for browsing the web, plenty fast for casual games (I’ve been playing a lot of Dredge and Mini Metro, in addition to my usual diet of crosswords and Tiny Wings), and responsive in everyday use — all in all a very good iPad.

Say what you want about the iPad. The colors are the best.

But as soon as you crank up the intensity, the base iPad starts to falter. There are a bunch of games it simply can’t play: Assassin’s Creed Mirage and Resident Evil 4 just straight-up don’t support the device. There are others, like Call of Duty: Warzone, where you can really feel the lack of graphics power. I’ll be running down a darkened alley in Warzone, and the shadows start to flicker in and out of position, rendering and rerendering a beat too slowly. Even in productivity-focused tools like Notability, the base iPad lags a bit under the weight of a particularly visual page. And if you’re a multitasker, prone to firing up Stage Manager (on an Air or Pro, since the base model doesn’t support the feature) or just a lot of heavy slide-over usage, you’ll notice the difference.

Even if you don’t care about the cores right now, I bet you will pretty soon. The base iPad doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, for instance, and while it’s not missing much right now, there will probably be some worthwhile local AI features in the next few years. (The other AI-related downside: the iPad also has 6GB of RAM, when the Air has 8GB.) As more apps update to take advantage of the extra power on the Air and Pro, they might start to feel even slower on the iPad. The other iPads have much more power than most people need, but that means they have space for you and your needs to grow. The base iPad doesn’t.

The other big tradeoff with the base iPad is the accessories. Both the iPad Pro and iPad Air support the latest Apple Pencil and have very good Magic Keyboard accessories, none of which work on the iPad. Instead, you get the last-gen Pencil and the substantially worse Magic Keyboard Folio. Is it annoying that this tablet is the same size as the 11-inch Air and totally could work in the same keyboard case, except Apple didn’t include the magnets? Yes. But this is where things are.

I still think the iPad is a great tablet, and it’s very good at most of the things most people need from their iPads. If its $349 price fits your budget, or you’re looking for something simple to give to the kids, buy it with no reservations. Frankly, if you just want the thing because the yellow and pink are the best colors Apple offers on any of its devices, I get it. But if you can, you should buy an iPad that will last you at least five years, and ideally even a few more. This iPad is already far enough behind the curve that I’m no longer confident it will last that long. For the first time in a while, I think the Air is the better deal for most people.

No one knows why.

Xiaofeng Wang has a long list of prestigious titles. He was the associate dean for research at Indiana University's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, a fellow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a tenured professor at Indiana University at Bloomington. According to his employer, he has served as principal investigator on research projects totaling nearly $23 million over his 21 years there.

He has also co-authored scores of academic papers on a diverse range of research fields, including cryptography, systems security, and data privacy, including the protection of human genomic data. I have personally spoken to him on three occasions for articles here, here, and here.

""None of this is in any way normal""

In recent weeks, Wang's email account, phone number, and profile page at the Luddy School were quietly erased by his employer. Over the same time, Indiana University also removed a profile for his wife, Nianli Ma, who was listed as a Lead Systems Analyst and Programmer at the university's Library Technologies division.

According to the Herald-Times in Bloomington, a small fleet of unmarked cars driven by government agents descended on the Bloomington home of Wang and Ma on Friday. They spent most of the day going in and out of the house and occasionally transferred boxes from their vehicles. TV station WTHR, meanwhile, reported that a second home owned by Wang and Ma and located in Carmel, Indiana, was also searched. The station said that both a resident and an attorney for the resident were on scene during at least part of the search.",arstechnica
https://arstechnica.com,NASA’s Curiosity rover has found the longest chain carbon molecules yet on Mars,https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/nasas-curiosity-rover-has-found-the-longest-chain-carbon-molecules-yet-on-mars/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 11:00:32 GMT","NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover has detected the largest organic (carbon-containing) molecules ever found on the red planet. The discovery is one of the most significant findings in the search for evidence of past life on Mars. This is because, on Earth at least, relatively complex, long-chain carbon molecules are involved in biology. These molecules could actually be fragments of fatty acids, which are found in, for example, the membranes surrounding biological cells.

Scientists think that, if life ever emerged on Mars, it was probably microbial in nature. Because microbes are so small, it’s difficult to be definitive about any potential evidence for life found on Mars. Such evidence needs more powerful scientific instruments that are too large to be put on a rover.

The organic molecules found by Curiosity consist of carbon atoms linked in long chains, with other elements bonded to them, like hydrogen and oxygen. They come from a 3.7-billion-year-old rock dubbed Cumberland, encountered by the rover at a presumed dried-up lakebed in Mars’s Gale Crater. Scientists used the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on the NASA rover to make their discovery.

Scientists were actually looking for evidence of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins and therefore key components of life as we know it. But this unexpected finding is almost as exciting. The research is published in Proceedings of the National Academies of Science.

Among the molecules were decane, which has 10 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms, and dodecane, with 12 carbons and 26 hydrogen atoms. These are known as alkanes, which fall under the umbrella of the chemical compounds known as hydrocarbons.

It’s an exciting time in the search for life on Mars. In March this year, scientists presented evidence of features in a different rock sampled elsewhere on Mars by the Perseverance rover. These features, dubbed “leopard spots” and “poppy seeds,” could have been produced by the action of microbial life in the distant past, or not. The findings were presented at a US conference and have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.",arstechnica
https://gizmodo.com,AI Experts Say We’re on the Wrong Path to Achieving Human-Like AI,https://gizmodo.com/ai-experts-say-were-on-the-wrong-path-to-achieving-human-like-ai-2000581717,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:00:33 GMT","According to a panel of hundreds of artificial intelligence researchers, the field is currently pursuing artificial general intelligence the wrong way.

This insight was revealed at the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)’s 2025 Presidential Panel on the Future of AI Research. The lengthy report was put together by 24 AI researchers whose expertise ranges from the state of AI infrastructure to the social aspects of artificial intelligence.

The report included a main takeaway for each section, as well as a community opinion section where respondents were asked their own thoughts about the section.

The section on “AI Perception vs. Reality”, chaired by MIT computer scientist Rodney Brooks, referenced the Gartner Hype Cycle characterization, a five-stage cycle common for technology hype. In November 2024, Gartner “estimated that hype for Generative AI had just passed its peak and was on the downswing,” the report noted. 79% of respondents in the community opinion section stated that current public perceptions of AI’s capabilities do not match the reality of AI research and development, with 90% saying that the mismatch is hindering AI research—74% of that number saying that “the directions of AI research are driven by the hype.”

“I included the Gartner Hype Cycle as it is something they have used for years and is a generalization of all the hype up followed by disappointment across so many different fields,” Brooks told Gizmodo in an email, “and therefore its existence and accuracy over so many fields tells us something about how we should use caution in accepting the current levels of hype about what is coming, any second now, with some caution.”

“I think large sections of public discourse about AI is too accepting of the hype level as accurate,” Brooks added.

Artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to human-level intelligence: The hypothetical intelligence of a machine that interprets information and learns from it as a human being would. AGI is a holy grail of the field, with implications for automation and efficiency across countless fields and disciplines. Consider any menial task that you don’t want to spend much time doing, from planning a trip to filing your taxes. AGI could be deployed to ease the burden of rote tasks, but also catalyze progress in other fields, from transportation to education and technology.

The surprising majority—76% of 475 respondents—said that simply scaling up current approaches to AI will not be sufficient to yield AGI.

“Overall, the responses indicate a cautious yet forward-moving approach: AI researchers prioritize safety, ethical governance, benefit-sharing, and gradual innovation, advocating for collaborative and responsible development rather than a race toward AGI,” the report wrote.

Despite hype distorting the state of research—and current approaches to AI not putting researchers on the most optimal path towards AGI—the technology has made leaps and bounds.

“Five years ago, we could hardly have been having this conversation – AI was limited to applications where a high percentage of errors could be tolerated, such as product recommendation, or where the domain of knowledge was strictly circumscribed, such as classifying scientific images,” explained Henry Kautz, a computer scientist at the University of Virginia and chair of the report’s section on Factuality & Trustworthiness, in an email to Gizmodo. “Then, quite suddenly in historic terms, general AI started to work and come to public attention through chatbots such as ChatGPT.”

AI factuality is “far from solved”, the report read, and the best LLMs only answered about half of a set of questions correctly in a 2024 benchmark test. But new training methods can improve the robustness of those models, and new ways of organizing AI can further better their performance.

“I believe the next stage in improving trustworthiness will be the replacement of individual AI agents with cooperating teams of agents that continually fact-check either other and try to keep each other honest,” Kautz added. “Most of the general public as well as the scientific community—including the community of AI researchers—underestimates the quality of the best AI systems today; the perception of AI lags about a year or two behind the technology.”

AI is not going anywhere; after all, the Gartner Hype Cycle doesn’t end with “fade into oblivion,” but instead the “plateau of productivity.” Different arenas of AI use cases have different levels of hype, but with all the clamor about AI—from the private sector, from government officials, heck, from our own families—the report is a refreshing reminder that AI researchers are thinking very critically about the state of their field. From the way AI systems are built to the ways they are deployed in the world, there is room for innovation and improvement. Since we aren’t going back to a time without AI, the only direction is forward.",gizmodo

But it’s time to stop gazing at the Weyoun figure that you still can’t believe will soon join your collection, for io9 has an important announcement to make: wave two of Nacelle’s Star Trek action figure line is coming!

At last, Star Trek toys have broken away from their weird history and are now delivering figures on a level that fans have been wanting for literal decades. Revealed at Nacelle’s Star Trek action figure panel with Nicholas Meyer (director of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country) at this weekend’s WonderCon in Anaheim, CA, the wave two figures kick off with this killer entry:

Captain Kirk from Star Trek: Generations – This figure was teased at the recent New York Toy Fair, and it’s the only one with accompanying prototype images so far. Note the accessories: jar of dill weed! HORSE!

Here’s a closer look at the accessories in prototype form:

The rest include:

Captain Janeway from the Star Trek: Voyager episode “Year of Hell”

Nog (Starfleet Uniform) from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine

T’Pol from Star Trek: Enterprise

Valeris from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country

Romulan Commander from Star Trek: The Original Series

Carol Marcus from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan

Bem from Star Trek: The Animated Series

Worf (Generations Sailor) from Star Trek: Generations

Geordi La Forge (Generations Sailor) from Star Trek: Generations

A press release from Nacelle reminds us that its founder and CEO (not to mention noted toy fanatic) Brian Volk-Weiss specifically wanted these releases to be “made by passionate Star Trek fans, for Star Trek fans,” and drew on fan feedback and suggestions when deciding which characters to include. You’ll note that wave two has 10 figures, building on the eight included in wave one.

“We’re trying to take a simple, but calculated approach with this line,” Volk-Weiss added. “We want to find the perfect balance of making characters for the first time as toys, combined with doing modern versions of the series main cast in their duty uniforms. By listening to fellow fans, we have hopefully found a line up that will keep everyone excited for many years to come!”

The attention to detail was impeccable in wave one (those perfectly chosen accessories!), and we’re eager to see the full images of wave two when they’re made available.

As a reminder, here’s who’s included in wave one: Captain Jellico from Star Trek: The Next Generation episode “Chain of Command;” Weyoun from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine; Captain Garrett from Star Trek: The Next Generation episode “Yesterday’s Enterprise;” Captain Sulu from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country; Peter Preston from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan; Tuvix from Star Trek: Voyager episode “Tuvix;” Valkris from Star Trek III: The Search for Spock; and Mirror Archer from Star Trek: Enterprise episode “In A Mirror, Darkly.”

For now, you can pre-order wave one at the Nacelle Store. Those initial figures should ship out in October, and cost $29 for individual figures or $225 for the full set. No word yet on when wave two will be up for pre-order or a shipping date, but we’ll keep you posted.",gizmodo

Sooner or later, everyone in his circle finds a reason to hate him, and then he goes away to ruin someone else’s life until his students and surrogate family “need” him again. After terrorizing his fellow mutants on Earth the last few years, Charles is doing the next worse thing and spreading his special brand of chaos to the stars.

On Friday, Marvel revealed Charles and his frequent lover Lilandra of the Shi’ar Empire will be major players in the upcoming Imperial comic. If you haven’t been keeping up with the X-Men in a while, Charles was imprisoned in his own institute after Krakoa fell and Orchis was defeated. During the recently ended X-Manhunt event, he broke out and went on the run while suffering from a brain tumor that’s been killing innocent people. The various X-Men teams fought individual mutants like Storm and Havok over whether to arrest or help him, but in the end, Xavier meets with Lilandra to jettison off to space and help their daughter Xandra.

The big premise of Imperial—written by Jonathan Hickman and drawn by Iban Coello and Federico Vicentini—is the sudden assassination of several major galactic leaders. So far, Marvel’s been mum on who specifically gets got, but in addition to being a chaos agent, one thing Charles tends to do is lead. Given Hickman’s promise of this event being a huge shakeup for the comics’ cosmic side, making Xavier a big player in that landscape would certainly fit the bill. But will the various empires of the galaxy survive whatever he puts them through before he dips back to Earth?

With the show ending soon, creator Tony Gilroy hopes its greatest impact is inspiring the franchise to continue diversifying.

Speaking to GamesRadar, Gilroy teased the second season would “break new ground and open up some canonical things and concepts” in such a way that future creatives “get excited to do other things.” What does he have in mind? To him, Andor could (and should) pave the way for “a [Star Wars] three-camera sitcom, or a horror movie.” He really thinks the franchise needs some spicing up, because he also recalled the first thing he said to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy when she reached out to him: “I think I said, ‘Could you do a courtroom drama?'”

For a long time, Star Wars has primarily done stories centered on the Jedi, clones, and Mandalorians (or all three). Andor’s first season didn’t have any of that and focused on other unexplored facets of the universe—bureaucracy, the logistics of heists and prison facilities, kicking fascists and hitting them with bricks—and became a critical darling, something its trailers have happily highlighted. Outside Gilroy’s own show, Skeleton Crew is another good example of what he’s talking about, since it’s kid-focused and more of an adventure story. “We’ve made our lane, and we’ve worked really hard to make it. It’s up to other people now to find another way to do it.”

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies are those that generally promote fair treatment of people of all backgrounds. The Trump administration is not a fan of DEI—on the first day of Trump’s second term, the White House called DEI programs “illegal and immoral” and declared that the government is “committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect.” To that end, it seems that NASA removed graphic novels about a fictional female astronaut named Callie Rodriguez from its website.

As reported by Keith Cowing of NASA Watch, the graphic novels had been online for years. (“Apparently NASA DEI Sanitation Squad is using my postings to help them delete things,” Cowing wrote.) The series titles were “First Woman: NASA’s Promise for Humanity” and “First Woman: Expanding Our Universe.”

The space agency left up releases announcing editions of the graphic novels and updates to the series, but the main landing page—dedicated to Rodriguez’s story as the (fictional) first woman to walk on the Moon—now yields a 404 error. NASA’s Press Secretary Bethany Stevens did not respond to a request for comment.

In January, NASA moved to terminate diversity programs, and last month the agency informed its employees that they could no longer display pronouns in their online profiles, from email signatures to their Microsoft Outlook accounts.

This week alone has been a turbulent one for NASA under the Trump administration—several days ago, the agency terminated $420 million in contracts, according to the the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has slashing headcount at the federal government since its creation by executive order on Trump’s first day in office. It remains to be seen how drastically DOGE, under the leadership of Elon Musk, will alter operations at the nation’s space agency.",gizmodo

Seeing this, YouTube’s now decided to cut that off and paused a pair of channels best known for those trailers.

Per Deadline, which initially reported on this, YouTube’s turned off the ad revenue for Screen Culture and KH Films. The former is the most famous of the two, and founder Nikhil Chaudhari was quoted throughout Deadline’s report. Some of its most famous videos have been “trailers” for Fantastic Four: First Steps and Superman. Meanwhile, KH Studio has made trailers for a Squid Game season starring Leonardo DiCaprio and a James Bond movie headlined by Henry Cavill and Margot Robbie.

YouTube is hitting Screen Culture and KH Studio with claims of violating its monetization policies. As Deadline notes, creators have to make significant changes if they’re using materials made from others, and videos can’t be “duplicative or repetitive,” or made “for the sole purpose of getting views.” Misinformation also plays a hand here, since the site forbids content made in a way that could mislead viewers. For example, Screen Culture’s Fantastic Four videos have teased Julia Garner’s Silver Surfer and Ralph Ineson’s Galactus, two characters who haven’t been revealed in Marvel’s trailer.

KH Studio founder told Deadline his videos are just meant to provide fun ‘what if’ scenarios, and called it “tough to see it grouped under ‘misleading content’ in the demonetization decision. My goal has always been to explore creative possibilities – not to misrepresent real releases.” During the initial reporting, Chaudhari took a similar stance, saying most YouTube users know its videos are fake, so there’s no real harm done.

The prequel just began its preview run this weekend ahead of its full launch in April, and that means it’s time to start hyping it up. Netflix has provided two new screenshots for the Broadway production, which show Louis McCartney as Henry Creel—aka One, aka Vecna—using his powers and making contact with the Mind Flayer.

In addition to that, Netflix announced an upcoming documentary covering First Shadow’s production before its West End opening night in December 2023. Along a seal of approval from Stranger Things creators Ross and Matt Duffer, the West End show opened to critical acclaim and later won two Olivier Awards for set design and entertainment of comedy or play. McCartney himself also took home a Stage Debut Award for Best Performer in 2024.

Set in 1959, First Shadow sees the 15-year-old Creel as he and his family have just moved to Hawkins for a fresh start. Initially, Henry’s able to make friends, join the school play, and cross paths with teenage versions of future Stranger Things mains like Hopper and Joyce. Things get more complicated when weird crimes start happening around the city, which may be connected to his powers. Along with McCartney, the Broadway cast includes Alison Jaye, Burke Swanson, and T.R. Knight.

In a Tudum blog, director Stephen Daldry discussed the challenge of “creating a visceral experience for the audience, where they feel shock and awe, surprise and delight. You have to deliver that. The fusion of television and theater is about the speed of narrative and how you create it … There are moments in First Shadow where you will think: I don’t understand how they did that.”

The video was captured by the orbiter’s Metis instrument, a coronagraph which blocks light directly from the Sun in order to see fainter phenomena in its outer atmosphere, or corona. New research describing the observations was published today in The Astrophysical Journal.

“In this paper, we present observations by Metis during its perihelion passage of a striking helical radial structure that extended from 1.5 to 3 [solar radii] and lasted for more than 3 hr,” the team wrote. “To the best of our knowledge, these observations are unique, in that they appear to show directly the long-duration outflow of Alfvénic solar wind into the heliosphere.”

The solar radius is 432,690 miles (696,347 kilometers), so the structure described by the team extended as far as 1,298,070 miles (2,089,041 kilometers)—it’s a pretty large structure!

The video was taken by Metis on October 12, 2022. Metis is the only instrument capable of seeing such subtle features of the solar wind, according an ESA release. The Solar Orbiter regularly catches quirks of the Sun’s extreme physics; just last month, the spacecraft witnessed (and recorded) tiny jets produced near the Sun’s South Pole.

Solar wind is constantly hitting Earth, with particles sometimes kickstarting aurorae in our planet’s skies. But Metis’ unique capabilities allow researchers to study the solar wind at its source, shedding light not just on the wind but also on the Sun’s inner corona, which produces the particles.

The current plan is to keep Solar Orbiter operational through 2026, though the mission could be extended until 2030. We’ll almost certainly have more remarkably intimate looks into our host star before then.",gizmodo

A fragment of the fragile manuscript had been repurposed in the binding of a 16th-century property record, making it almost impossible to study the medieval text without dismantling and certainly damaging the record’s cover. Almost impossible—but not completely.

An interdisciplinary team of scholars from the University of Cambridge used various advanced imaging techniques to create a virtual copy of the binding, allowing them to digitally unfold the rare text without having to damage it or the property record. This ground-breaking approach also preserves the artifact as an example of 16th-century archival binding practice, which is “a piece of history in its own right,” Irène Fabry-Tehranchi, a French Specialist in Collections and Academic Liaison at Cambridge University Library who was involved in the project, explained in a university statement.

In addition to common tools such as mirrors, magnets, and prisms, Fabry-Tehranchi and her colleagues used cutting-edge imaging techniques to photograph every facet of the folded fragment, make the text more readable, and create a highly detailed 3D model of the artifact to understand the structure of the binding without having to take it apart. Hundreds of images were then pieced together like a puzzle to create a digital version of the cover, which researchers can now unfold and study as if they were holding the real thing.

“If this had been done 30 years ago, the fragment might have been cut, unfolded, and flattened. But today, preserving it in situ gives us a crucial insight into 16th-century archival practices, as well as access to the medieval story itself,” said Fabry-Tehranchi. “It was first thought to be a 14th century story about Sir Gawain but further examination revealed it to be part of the Old French Vulgate Merlin sequel, a different and extremely significant Arthurian text.”

The medieval legends of King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, the knight Sir Lancelot, the magician Merlin, and the quest for the Holy Grail have been written, copied, readapted, performed, studied, and produced in countless versions for centuries—perhaps over a thousand years. The Vulgate Cycle, also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, is one such version in Old French.

Written in the first half of the 13th century, it recounts the Arthurian legends in a monumental five-part epic prose. The fragment found at Cambridge University Library is from the Suite Vulgate du Merlin, a part of the Vulgate Cycle that recounts events that take place after King Arthur’s coronation. One passage from the fragment tells of the Christian victory over the Saxons at the Battle of Cambénic involving the knight Gauvin (also Gawain) with his Excalibur sword. Another recounts when a disguised Merlin appears at King Arthur’s court during the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. Here’s the English translation:

While they were rejoicing in the feast, and Kay the seneschal brought the first dish to King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, there arrived the most handsome man ever seen in Christian lands. He was wearing a silk tunic girded by a silk harness woven with gold and precious stones which glittered with such brightness that it illuminated the whole room.

There are less than 40 surviving copies of the Suite Vulgate du Merlin text known to scholars, and since medieval scribes copied them by hand, each is a unique version. The one found at Cambridge University Library, for example, has decorative red and blue initials. Based on this as well as other features, the researchers suggest the text was written between 1275 and 1315.

However, “this project was not just about unlocking one text—it was about developing a methodology that can be used for other manuscripts,” Fabry-Tehranchi concluded. “Libraries and archives around the world face similar challenges with fragile fragments embedded in bindings, and our approach provides a model for non-invasive access and study.”

One person’s trash (or book binding) really might be another person’s treasure—even 750 years later.",gizmodo
https://gizmodo.com,Farewell to unhealthy school meals: what is imminent us,https://de.gizmodo.com/abschied-von-ungesunden-schulmahlzeiten-was-uns-bevorsteht-2000018795,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 18:48:33 GMT","New habits on the school board: end with the simple menu

The Ministry of Social Rights is working on a royal decree that is supposed to end the abuse of unhealthy products in school canteens. The proposal includes clear restrictions for pre -cooked dishes such as pizzas or fried food, with only such a meal is allowed per month. The intention is clear: to promote menus with more fruit, vegetables and fresh food.

The current data from the Aladino study and the national plan for the control of the food chain show a worrying situation: The current menus does not correspond to the nutritional criteria recommended by organizations such as the WHO, especially in facilities with students from low-income families. Specifically, about a third of the school canteens serve more than four pre -cooked dishes per month.

What will actually change in the school canteens?

The new royal decree will dictate that fruit and vegetables are offered daily. In addition, at least 45 % of these products must be seasonal, and 5 % of the monthly budget for food must be used for biological products. It is not just about improving nutritional quality, but also about promoting sustainability and even access to healthy nutrition.

Regional foods and short production chains are also prioritized. Schools have to incorporate legumes and whole grains more often and ensure that meat and fish recognized nutritional standards correspond.

Automats and cafeterias: the other regulated front

Another important point is the restriction of unhealthy products outside the canteen. The decree will restrict the sale of industrial bakery and sugar -containing drinks - including energy drinks - into cafeterias and machines. Only products that do not contain more than five grams of sugar per serving will be allowed.

In addition, these machines must not be set up in areas that are accessible to children in preschool and primary school, and they can still show advertising of any kind. The last data are worrying: In the secondary level, almost 70 % of the vending machines do not correspond to the criteria of the WHO, and the situation deteriorated from year to year.

For years, global dominance in certain raw materials was in the hands of China, Vietnam and Brazil. Spain seemed completely out of the radar ... until now. Data from the Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Change confirm that the country has more than 2,700 active companies that are distributed through its territory. But the really amazing is not the number, but the type of resources they contain.

The focus is on the so -called rare earths: a sentence of chemical elements that are difficult to win, it is expensive to process, but crucial for the production of modern technologies such as microchips, electric motors, wind turbines or advanced batteries.

What previously seemed exclusively in other regions of the planet could be closer than we think. And best of all: in large quantities.

Regions with strategic wealth in full upswing

Andalusia leads national metal mining production, with 80 % of the total production. In the province of Granada there is the largest Celestinite deposit in Europe, which is essential for the electronics industry. Meanwhile, Castile and León do not remain: their ""white gold"" and the uranium mine of Retortillo open up opportunities both in mining and in energetic sovereignty.

Kastilien-La Mancha comes into play with a remarkable discovery: Monazit in Campo de Montiel. This mineral contains elements such as CER, Neodym and Lanthan, which are indispensable for high technology products. Extremadura houses one of the most ambitious projects: San José de Valdeflórez, which could generate around 20,000 tons of lithium hydroxide annually, enough for a million electric vehicles.

Strategy, recycling and innovation for a key future

The available resources are just the first step. Spain has started to sketch a clear way to use it. One of her greatest achievements was the creation of the first European recycling facility for rare earths that ISASMELT F600 furnaces uses to regain valuable materials by melting in melted bathroom.

The process, although complex, is one of the most efficient and sustainable. It enables recyclable metal elements to separate so precisely that they can supply the technology industries again without dependence on foreign suppliers.

In addition to the technical, this strategy also has positive effects on the local economy, creates new jobs and increases energetic autonomy. Spain doesn't want to stay behind. It has the resources, the knowledge and now also the infrastructure to become an essential player in the future technological and energetic landscape of Europe.

https://gizmodo.com,The day on which the earth becomes uninhabitable (according to scientific predictions),https://de.gizmodo.com/der-tag-an-dem-die-erde-unbewohnbar-wird-laut-wissenschaftlichen-vorhersagen-2000018789,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 18:37:37 GMT","A scientific prediction that is as distant as worrying

Although no living person will experience it today, a team of scientists has found that survival on earth is limited. In cooperation with NASA, researchers from the Tōhō University have calculated with advanced models and powerful supercomputers that our planet will be completely uninhabitable in 1000002021 in the year. There will be no trace of life.

This scenario is based on simulations that analyze the evolution of the sun and its influence on the solar system. Over the millennia, the sun will inevitably expand and create so much thermal energy that any form of life on earth will be impossible. Even if this date is more than 999 million years in the future, this consideration is already being discussed in the scientific community.

Colonization of other worlds: from theory to necessity

This future raises uncomfortable but necessary questions. Should humanity actually think about leaving the planet? The current missions for Mars and the vision of entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk pursue exactly this goal: to secure a second option for human life.

Musk has spoken out directly: If SpaceX manages to bring people to Mars, it will be his most important legacy. The space colonization, which until recently appeared like science fiction, begins to be seen as an alternative plan for long-term survival.

Sun changes and invisible threats

It is not necessary to wait millions of years to feel the effects of the sun. In May last year, NASA found a number of strong sun eruptions and coronal mass pollution that influenced the earth's atmosphere and caused the most intense sunstorm for twenty years.

These events, although less extreme, are signs of what could happen on a large scale in the future: temperature rise, decrease in the available oxygen and gradually degeneration of the atmosphere. Based on this data, mathematical models come to the conclusion that the earth will become uninhabitable over time.

Is there hope through technology?

Despite the dark scenario that draw the calculations, the experts agree on one point: there is still scope. Technological progress could be crucial to extend life on earth or make survival possible in other places. The expected progress include closed systems for the production of water and air that are essential for survival outside the planet.

The clock ticks slowly but steadily. And although the apocalypse scenario is still far away, the associated question is already forcing us to think about how we can manage the challenges of the future.

Shawn Michael, a 48-year-old man from the USA, was diagnosed with advanced colon cancer. His story was taken up by the Greek medium of enikos and sparked interest in astonishing detail: he had only one symptom before the diagnosis, and that was one that many people consider trivial.

This symptom, which affects between 12 % and 20 % of the Spaniards, according to the foundation for the digestive system, was simply constipation. Although it happens frequently, it can hide more than it appears.

The Spanish Cancer Aid (AECC) has repeatedly pointed out changes in bowel movements as possible warning signals in the case of colon cancer. This does not mean that every change implies the presence of a tumor, but it should be examined medically, especially when it continues.

Beyond the constipation: other signs that you should pay attention to

The AECC indicates that these changes can comment on both constipation and diarrhea, even among people who had previously had normal bowel movements. In fact, it is the most common that both symptoms change and create an irregular pattern.

In addition, there are other signs that could accompany these changes and that should not be overlooked:

Unusual fatigue for no reason

Inexplicable weight loss

Persistent abdominal pain

Presence of blood or mucus in the chair

Constant feeling of not completely emptieding the intestine (Tenesmus)

Justify this information, although they do not always use a serious illness, a visit to the doctor, especially if they appear together or exist for a long time.

The meaning not to underestimate the ordinary

The message is clear: symptoms that appear slightly, the first indications of more serious problems could be. In the case of Shawn, constipation was the only warning signal before discovering a cancer in stage 4.

The walk to a specialist with persistent irregularities can make the difference. Only one specialist can evaluate the symptoms in context and set the next steps for an appropriate diagnosis. Prevention and early attention remain our best allies.

The Ministry of Health has ordered an urgent recall of a product that can be found in many supermarket cupboards. Specifically, it is the bags ""4 Golden Savoury Rice Steam Bags"" from the Iceland brand in the 600-gram presentation. This product was classified as potentially dangerous for allergic people or people with food intolerance.

In cooperation with the Ministry of Health, the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (Aesan) pointed out that the identification of the product does not clearly state whether allergens such as milk, fish, crustaceans or molluscs are contained or not. This omission is a considerable risk for those who have to check exactly what they consume.

The product belongs to the category of frozen goods and was on sale in supermarket chains of various regions of the country. Although the warning was originally communicated in July 2024, the warning is still active because the person concerned has its best before the date of the best before November 16, 2025. It is therefore very likely that many people still have it at home without being aware of the associated risks.

Where was it sold and why does the warning remain active?

According to official information, this frozen rice of the Iceland brand was mainly sold in communities such as Andalusia, Murcia and the Valencian community. However, it is not excluded that it was also available in other regions of the country, given the brand's national sales.

The main reason for the recall is the lack of clear information about allergens on the label, which violates basic food security regulations. In such cases, the health authorities are obliged to intervene in order to prevent possible serious consequences for the health of consumers.

The Ministry of Health emphasizes how important it is to check the freezer and not to consume this product if it is still in the house. You also recommend that you pay attention to updates regarding the status of the warning, since these can also be extended to other products or batches if similar problems are determined.

Staying informed is the key to ensure that what we put on the table corresponds to the security standards required by the authorities.

For years, artificial intelligence has been seen as a technological curiosity. She developed from the generation of funny images to a useful tool for editing photos, writing texts or automating repetitive tasks. Today it is no longer limited to facilitating our work or daily life: it is also indispensable in the global company structure.

This progress did not come overnight, but could achieve a decisive point in 2025. This is pointed out by Jon Hernández, a Spanish expert for AI who thinks this will be the year in which we will stop considering it as something external. In his opinion, we will realize that it directly influences our personal, professional and social life.

The year in which we will see everything more clearly

The newsletter Algoritmo Diperente, led by Saúl Gordillo, opened the year 2025 with predictions of several experts in the field of artificial intelligence. Under all the voices, Jon Hernández's special stands out. He claims that this year is not only talking about AI, but we will consciously perceive how it penetrates and changes us.

Hernández also predicts a new protagonist in this scenario: the intelligent agents. These systems will not only react to our inquiries, but will be able to make decisions and carry out complex tasks independently. Autonomous assistants who act on their own initiative, so to speak.

From everyday use to the existential debate

You don't have to imagine a distant future to see how artificial intelligence is already part of almost all areas of life. Multinational companies such as Microsoft, Apple or Telefónica have integrated them deep into their processes. At the same time, millions of people use them every day to work, clarify questions and even organize travel.

The potential of this technology to accelerate human progress is undeniable, but there are also voices that indicate their dark side. Some industry leaders, such as Elon Musk, have sketched extreme scenarios that range from impressive progress to existential threats. Musk claimed that we could face a world dominated by enemy robots in a decade, but trusts that the outcome will be more positive.

The number of air travelers in Spain always reaches new records. According to the latest estimates, 2024 concluded with more than 309 million travelers and even exceeded the figures from pandemic. With so many flights, the protocols and security measures on board were also reinforced.

During the start, landing and a large part of the flight, there are several rules that we all have to follow: pull up the blind by the window, fold in the table on the seat, put on the seat belt when the sign lights up and of course activate the flight mode on the cell phone. But why is the latter so important?

The real reason behind the flight mode

Rafa San Julián, a pilot at Iberia with more than two decades, explains that this measure is not a mere formality. In the past, certain cell phones could cause disorders in the electronic systems of the aircraft. Although the aviation technology has developed greatly and is more robust today, there is still an uncertainty factor.

""The problem is that you cannot predict how new telephone models react to the aircraft systems,"" says San Julián. ""For reasons why the devices are kept in flight mode for precautionary reasons to prevent them from sending them with maximum performance.""

Window blinds up and other details that are important

In addition to the cell phone, there are other elements that have their explanation. For example, the blind on the window must always be raised during important maneuvers such as start and landing. The reason? Security.

San Julián clearly summarizes it: ""If you have to evacuate, we have to see what happens outside. If it burns, we need to know which side of the aircraft is safer to get out and what emergency outputs can be opened. Every second counts in such a situation.""

https://gizmodo.com,What was never told about bread for breakfast: insights from endocrinology,https://de.gizmodo.com/was-dir-nie-ueber-brot-zum-fruehstueck-erzaehlt-wurde-einblicke-aus-der-endokrinologie-2000018774,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 18:08:05 GMT","Although bread is a classic on the Spanish table, especially for breakfast, some experts warn of the metabolic effects that it can have. This article explains why consumption in the early morning may not be the best choice, especially for people with insulin resistance, obesity or fatty liver.

A widespread habit ... but as innocent as it seems?

Bread, in its different variants, is one of the most common foods found in Spanish nutrition. According to the Pan Cada Día Association, over 92 % of the population regularly consume it, and 75 % choose white bread. Toast with tomatoes, fresh sandwiches, bread with jam ... it is difficult to imagine breakfast without it.

Nevertheless, some endocrinologists have long warned that breaking the fasting with bread is not ideal, especially in certain health conditions. The endocrinologist Francisco Rosero, for example, argues that the day with bread - be it white bread or sourdough - negatively influences the glucose level and offers little nutritional value.

During the nighttime fasting lessons, the body enters an optimal metabolic state to use fat reserves as energy sources. But if the first meal a day is a fast carbohydrate source like bread, this fat loss is stopped abruptly. Instead, insulin production increases, which favors fat storage, makes weight loss difficult and causes problems such as obesity or type 2 diabetes.

What happens in the body when you break fasting with bread

The consumption of bread on sober stomach can be particularly harmful to people with existing metabolic disorders. In the case of insulin resistance or increased glucose mirrors, the body already has difficulty changing sugar. This sudden increase in glucose when having breakfast with bread forces the pancreas to produce more insulin, overload it and cause a chain reaction of metabolic problems.

The fatty liver, another frequent illness, is also affected. The excess of carbohydrates, as they occur in the bread, is converted into triglycerides and stored in the adipose tissue, which worsens the disease.

In addition, bread - especially white bread - is poor from a nutritional point of view of fiber and micronutrients. Although sourdough bread is considered healthier, the actual differences to white bread are minimal.

And sourdough bread? Is it really better?

Many consider it a healthier alternative, but sourdough bread offers no great advantages. It contains almost the same carbohydrates and calories such as white bread. Its glycemic index is only slightly lower (60 compared to 70), and although it delivers a little more fiber, this is not enough to alleviate its negative effects if it is consumed at the wrong time.

On the other hand, his gluten content remains, although it is reduced by fermentation. This can be problematic for people with sensitivity or intolerance.

Ultimately, there is no solid evidence by February 2025 that sourdough bread is significantly healthier. The difference is more in the taste and in the manufacturing process than in its health advantages.

Healthier alternatives for the start of the day

For those who want to maintain their metabolism from the start, there are better options to break fasting. Foods such as eggs, avocados, nuts or unsweetened natural yogurt offer proteins, healthy fats and fiber, keep the glucose level stable and ensure more saturation.

The ideal breakfast does not depend on the taste or habits, but on how your body reacts after hours of fasting. And according to experts, bread is not the best ally to start the day well.

It is somehow. Because who really needs Candy Crush or Beach Buggy Racing on the dashboard? And yet: For some situations - for example if you wait with your child until the other comes from football training - such a little game can be helpful.

Gaming in the car? Only when it says

The new games are part of Android Auto 14.1's beta update. There are classics like Farm Heroes Saga, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Angry Birds 2 and the Cartoon racing game Beach Buggy Racing. The feature was announced for the first time at the Pixel Feature Drop on March 4 - now it ends up in the first vehicles with Android Auto.

One thing is clear: playing is only allowed when the car is. And that's a good thing. Tesla had got trouble in the past because drivers gambled while driving-which the US transport authority didn't find funny at all. In the meantime, Tesla has deactivated the function in driving mode. So Google is on the safe side.

Show the first tests: Not everything runs smoothly yet

The first impressions, such as 9to5google, show: The whole thing works - but not perfectly. In a test video, Beach Buggy Racing was played on a connected Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The player steered the buggy with a finger - quite impractical if you have to lean over from the driver's seat to the screen. Two thumbs in front of them would be more pleasant.

In addition, not all games start reliably. With Angry Birds 2, for example, the icon was grayed after an error. And although Beach Buggy Racing offers an option for movement sensor control, it is difficult to imagine that someone equips their car with gyroscopes, only to take a few virtual curves better.

Entertainment in the passenger seat

Despite childhood diseases, an official video from Google shows that at least Farm Heroes Saga fits well on the car display in the 16: 9 format. Means: The games are visually adapted to the screen - which is a good sign for the release.

Of course, all of this is intended for passengers. Because honestly: The touchscreen in the center console is probably the most uncomfortable place to play - regardless of whether you are sitting in front or back. For bored kids in the back seat, which are waiting for their limo in the drive-in, it can be a nice pastime.

Gimmicks with strategy?

The exciting question is: Why does Google do that at all? Access to YouTube in the parked car still makes sense - but games?

Quite simply: Tesla does it. Native games have been played in Teslas since 2019, for example on the large screen in the middle. And Google obviously wants to catch up. Perhaps it is also about more than just a few candy crush moments.

Because in the long term, Google thinks towards autonomous driving. If one day the car really drives itself-for example through Waymo, Google's sister company for robotaxis-the interior becomes an entertainment zone. And then gaming suddenly makes a lot more sense in the car.

A gimmick with potential (when you stand)

For now, the new feature remains a nice gimmick for the standstill - literally. If you sit and wait in the car, you get a new way of distraction. But the idea only really makes sense when autonomous vehicles shape everyday life.

Until then, it is better to get the cell phone out and play there - is usually more convenient and also works.

https://gizmodo.com,Google turns Android development around-but not as you think,https://de.gizmodo.com/google-krempelt-android-entwicklung-um-aber-nicht-so-wie-du-denkst-2000018769,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:55:53 GMT","The signs have long been there: Google shifted its focus by Android as a heart - and towards the dazzling future of artificial intelligence. The current news now finally confirms where the journey is going. According to Android Authority, Google wants to complete Android's development completely internally. In short: the Android source code is privatized.

Of course, this is a win for Google. In the future, the group will no longer have to deal with two different code bases or react to external feedback, while in the background the next Android version is already being worked hard. This also brings advantages for users-because it means: no more android versions during the development phase. So far, on the one hand, there has been the internal source code that Google passes on to manufacturer with Google Mobile Services Treaty, and on the other hand, the publicly accessible Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which in principle can use everyone.

The fact that Google now completely switches to an internal development structure shows how the priorities have shifted in the company. Artificial intelligence is now the big thing - especially Gemini. Already at the developer conference Google I/O 2024 it became clear where the wind is blowing: The hardware and software departments were merged into a central ""Platforms and Devices"" unit. Just a month later, David Burke, who had significantly shaped Android development for 14 years, came back from his position as an engineering vice president and switched to an advisory role. Another sign of change.

Nevertheless - don't panic: Not much changes for the platform itself. According to the industry analyst Carolina Milanesi, the step makes sense from the point of view of resource distribution. ""The change is logical when you look at where the work really counts,"" she wrote in a message. At first glance, little changes for Android users. However, what could change noticeably is the exchange between Google and developers without a GMS contract. ""Developers may have less insight into what comes ... but the actual access remains the same,"" continues Milanesi.

So far, Google itself has not yet publicly commented on the changeover - although the information has been confirmed independently. Probably because it will make no visible difference for most. However, what should change: The classic code whisper that could be followed regularly on Android blogs should be quieter over time. Google will publish less open source code in the future - at least until it is really ready for the big appearance. For developers who have liked to sniff for months in advance in Android's future, this will certainly be frustrating. For most of the Android users: Business as usual.

Google withdraws from the public with the Android code-a strategic step that shows one thing above all: Artificial intelligence is now the star of the show. Android remains, but it becomes increasingly the stage for Google's larger ambitions.

https://gizmodo.com,The new contraceptive shot will be implant after the injection - without visiting the clinic,https://de.gizmodo.com/neuer-verhuetungsschuss-wird-nach-der-injektion-zum-langzeitimplantat-ganz-ohne-klinikbesuch-2000018757,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:36:35 GMT","Contraceptive implants are among the safest methods of contraception. They mostly consist of a small, flexible stick that is used under the skin and releases hormones for years. The catch? The intervention requires a visit to the doctor or in a clinic - and is not easily accessible to every woman.

But that could change soon.

A team of researchers has developed a new technology that combines the best of two worlds: the long -term effect of an implant and the uncomplicated application of an injection - without any medical staff. Her results were recently published in the Nature Chemical Engineering journal.

In the center of the whole are microscopic crystals-so-called ""self-assembling long-acting injectable microCrystals"" (slim). These tiny particles contain the hormone levonorgestrel, which is also used in classic contraceptives. After the injection, the crystals in the body form a depot that slowly releases the active ingredient for months or even years.

Revolution in contraception - with global perspective

""Our goal is to offer women worldwide various and easily applicable contraceptive methods - especially those that also work in regions without stable medical infrastructure,"" explains Vivian Feig, mechanical engineer at Stanford University and co -author of the study, in a statement of the MIT.

There are already classic contraceptive injections, but they have to be administered again every three months - and their effect is not quite as reliable as that of an implant. The new slim approach could finally close this gap.

The biggest challenge so far: active ingredients with long -term effects usually need large, thick needles - painful and impractical for everyday life. The new system starts here: The combination of fine crystals and a special liquid (benzylbenzoat) makes the injection possible even with significantly smaller needles. This minimizes pain, bruising - and makes the application realistic at home.

Less pain, more effect

""Two things have to be right for a broad application on the market: the needle size and the viscosity of the liquid,"" says Giovanni Traverso, senior author of the study and gastroenterologist on as well as at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. ""We wanted to create the most comfortable solution as possible - so small needles and a thin -fluid solution that can be easily injected by hand.""

Another advantage: The researchers can specifically adjust the mixing ratio of the solution in order to control the release of active ingredients individually. In this way, the duration of action can be extended or shortened - as required.

""This flexibility shows how versatile our system can be used - not only for contraception, but also for other medication with long -term effect,"" explains Sanghyun Park, doctoral student.

Not yet on the market, but promising

Sure, it still takes time for the new technology to arrive in pharmacies or clinics. Slim is currently still in the pre -clinical phase, i.e. in tests outside of human studies. However, the previous results are optimistic: a comfortable, long -lasting and self -distributable contraception - that would be a real gamuchang for many women.

And not only that: the use for other long -term therapies, such as against HIV, is also conceivable. This could gain access to vital medication worldwide - without regular visits to the doctor or complicated treatments.

The next step: clinical studies, regulatory permits and finally the leap into the real world. If everything goes well, Slim could swirl the contraceptive landscape - and maybe even medicine as a whole.

After an election campaign built on anti-agiornalism and anti-media rhetoric, but fuckly focused on the alt-right version of freedom of expression, the second Trump administration immediately started attacking journalism (or at least that not deployed in the infosphere of the US right) in various ways.

In just under two months from the settlement, Trump has already threatened to arrest the journalists of the editorial staff of 60 Minutes of CBS (and to revoke the broadcaster of the broadcaster) due to their assembly of an interview with Kamala Harris during the elections; Excluding the Associated Press from the Oval Studio, the Air Force One and similar environments because it continues to refer to the Gulf of Mexico with its real name; Cut the loans to numerous newspapers all over the world who received economic support from Usaid; threatened to modify the laws on defamation to make it easier to suck journalistic organizations, and publishers; Making a survey against the NPR and PBS broadcasters, with the aim of potentially freezing federal funding for all public radio -distribution and closed Voice of America, the American broadcaster born to respond to the Nazi propaganda in the Second World War. According to Reporters Without Borders, all the attacks that followed one another are part of what the organization has called a ""monumental assault on freedom of information"".

The systematic attacks of the White House in the press

We asked two experts what the long -term effects of the new Trump government on journalism and the US media world will be and what the direct impacts on freedom of the press in the country: Kerry Howley, journalist of the New York Magazine and author of the Reality Book. The deep state and the war for information (NR Edizioni) and Mike Ananny, professor and researcher at the Usca Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. The overall climate seems to have already taken a clear direction. ""We are witnessing several attacks on freedom of the press in the United States. Different journalistic organizations have paid to resolve legal causes intended by Trump, reporting their willingness to limit their freedoms to avoid Trump's wrath. Instead of choosing to fight these causes, they are consenting to the various Trump attempts to control their coverage, showing them that they are not willing to defend the editorial independence"", of the downtown atmosphere that you breathe in the US editorial offices.

Atmosphere that also affects the media coverage reserved for the new president by the US media, especially as regards its relations with the technological oligarchy and Elon Musk and their explicit authoritarian references already emerged: ""while some independent journalistic organizations and publishers, such as Wired and 404 media, are explicitly facing the power of Trump and producing a critical coverage based on a journalism based on the facts, Other newspapers have avoided denouncing the power of the Trump administration and its ties with fascism openly.",wired

After 35 years, it remains one of the best mainstream products that have ever been conceived, especially one of the funniest and most sparkling.

A universe born from the imagination of two cartoonists a little crazy

To understand how it was possible that Ninja turtles was able to collect something like 200 million dollars with Si and no $ 15 million (one of the most surprising hits of that period), it is necessary to embrace a certainty: it was a result connected to its own origin. The audiovisual, paper market and the one linked to toys during the 80s had been closely united. Some of the most successful franchise in fact, from the transformers to the Dino-Riders, from He-Man and then move on to the heroes of the DC Comics or Marvel, were protagonists of comics, as well as animated series, and of course toys lines that literally stolen. However, bringing all this to the big screen did not seem easy, and above all it was not a guarantee of success. Yet even then Ninja turtles was one of the most important symbols of the most important teen cultures of that decade just ended.

The revolution of the comic industry had allowed to lower the production and distribution costs in those years, and had found a new generation of authors, designers, new ideas and characters, who had made a breakdown to say the least predominantly. Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird published at his own expense in 1984 the first issue of a saga that moved halfway between the tribute and the parody of several three most important characters in Marvel and the DC Comics. Taking advantage of the era of the Direct Market, those who had allowed the proliferation of a tide of independent publishing houses, as a small niche product, the Ninja turtles became a real generational phenomenon, which changed the history of the independent market. Ninja turtles to the rescue was first of all an animated series, which since 1987 brought Leonardo, Donatello, Raffaello and Michelangelo to become idols for every child and teenager.

Breakfast Club after forty years remains an unparalleled film in telling the universe of teenagers The film by John Hughes came out in the room on February 15, 1985 and still remains the absolute totem of the MTV Generation and the 80s

But cinema at the time was another thing, it was thought that without the adult audience an operation was destined to fail. Walt Disney, Universal, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros, to say some, refused to produce and above all distribute the film, in reality around the Studios and only for some shot in New York, a city symbol of the anthropomorphic turtles quartet and their rodent master. Ninja turtles at the rescue arrived three years after the terrible flop at the Masters of the Universe box office. That film started from an even more important franchise, developed by Mattel, but had been a disaster of criticism and audience. The very popular transformers had not even gone better, who had sold toys for years. The animated film of 1986 had been a huge disappointment too. Fortunately, the New Line Cinema thought about it, at that moment a small kingdom especially for independent cinema and the B-Movies, to come to the rescue of the film.

Todd W. Langen and Bobby Herbeck's screenplay resumed the narrative line of the original comics, and only vaguely something of the animated series. The fundamental aspect was to make everything credible with real, real interpreters, who moved against the background of the Big Apple, in an exquisitely urban environment, where it is still possible to see the best of the references to the youth subculture of those years. In fact, talking about Ninja turtles to the rescue means talking about a film designed for a target, the adolescent one, which if on other occasions had proved disappointing, here instead it was the key to success. And so here we are, 35 years later, to rethink the journalist April O'Neal, to the foot clan that makes New York a jungle after all that is not different I give what Robocop, as well as other films of the time, had described.

A generational phenomenon that came up to the present day

In fact, it must be admitted that Steve Barron's film simply represented in a somewhat softer way, the petty crime that had made the 80s in the great American metropolises a real nightmare. To reflect us better then, all the protagonists referred to the minorities that in those years of reagentism were marginalized, ghettoized. Leonardo and the Latri basically live in the sewers! Here, however, were not the cocaine cowboys or the serial killers the bad, but Shredder, the head of the foot clan, a super ninja super ninja. In him there was another element of the film that paid tribute to the martial arts cinema. And then they were there: Leonardo, Raffaello Donatello and Michelangelo, hungry for pizza, teenagers turtles experts of martial arts, each different in character and style, which have become such after being in contact with a kind of radioactive potion, are still a simply fantastic mix.",wired

https://wired.com,What are the strange futuristic vehicles that run for Milan,https://www.wired.it/article/wayla-nuovi-pod-elettrici-modulari/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 04:20:00 GMT","Pod Wayla by Next arrived in Milan, innovative modular electric vehicles for now equipped with a driver, developed by the Paduan company Next. These vehicles - currently during the road test - will offer a safe, sustainable and convenient alternative to move to the city especially at night.

The initiative expands the Wayla fleet, the Italian startup that launched, always in Milan, the first Van Pooling service. The project is supported by Next, a cutting -edge company in the design of modular electric vehicles, designed to optimize urban transport.

The new Next modular pods

The modules of Next Srl, currently being tested, are compact but highly adaptable: they can transport up to 22 passengers and hook together to form a convoy equivalent to a traditional bus, up to a 18 meter with 5 modules hooked. They have an autonomy between 300 and 350 km, reach a maximum speed of 110 km/h and recharge completely in less than two hours.

The new pods being tested

In the top hours, the modules can join up to a maximum of five to increase the capacity, while in moments of less turnout they separate, reducing energy consumption of up to 75%. Once connected, the modules open the inter-veicular doors, allowing passengers to move freely among the means, optimizing the routes, the employment rate, and therefore the price and travel time.

The tests focus on urban performance, safety and reliability to offer an always efficient and widespread service. The production will start at the end of the summer and the first pods will be operational on the streets of Milan at the beginning of next year.

What is Wayla

Wayla, is the Italian startup in the urban mobility sector that launched the first Van Pooling service in Milan on 31 October 2024. Its service allows passengers to share the routes, reducing the number of vehicles in circulation during the evening and night.

Wayla offers a flexible and integrated service with other transport options, allowing citizens to move efficiently according to their needs. The platform allows you to share the routes, reducing the number of vehicles in circulation and improving urban mobility. The service is active in Milan from Wednesday to Saturday, from 19.30 to 3.00, and Sunday, from 17.30 to 3.00.",wired
https://wired.com,"For a Master Class in Salt, Try Making Kimchi",https://wired.com/story/making-kimchi-salt/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","Way back in 2018, I went to South Korea for a wedding. While there, I persuaded an elderly friend of my sister-in-law to show me how she made kimchi. When we arrived at her apartment, the living-room furniture had been pushed aside to make space. She spread a tarp across the floor and set out giant stainless steel bowls of prepped veggies, a bucket of napa cabbage she'd started salting the night before, and two kinds of fish sauce, one of them in a five-liter jug. What impressed me the most was what wasn't there: no recipes and no scale.

We worked through the whole process. Or really, she did. I mostly observed and took notes in awe as she eyeballed vast quantities of food, even the high-impact ingredients that, in inexperienced hands, can turn the end product into a salty disaster. When she finished and filed the kimchi in a special fridge on the porch, my lasting impression was of how she was able to do it without measuring a thing.

As a religious follower of recipes, I left that apartment feeling like I'd been to a magic show. I thought I'd come for hands-on time and a pro-level kimchi recipe but quickly realized I just wanted to understand how she had mastered salt.

Salt is one of the pillars of fermentation. Too little opens the door to unwanted results like mold, and too much just overloads and shorts out your palate. The right amount, however, encourages healthy bacteria to develop complex flavors, while simultaneously and amazingly killing off what's harmful. I'm an avid but conservative fermenter, which means I enjoy the relative certainty of using salt by weight percentages. I put what I'm fermenting on the scale, then mix in a percentage of that weight in salt. I am completely impressed by those who can wing it.

A pandemic or so after my first kimchi lesson in Seoul, I returned to better understand how they do it, this time making a smaller kitchen-countertop batch with Soo Jin Lee, my in-laws’ nanny. Soo Jin grew up with seven siblings in the southwestern Korean province Jeollabuk-do, where she and one other sister were her mother's primary helpers, but I was surprised by her answer when she said where she learned to cook.

https://wired.com,The Best Tax Services,https://wired.com/gallery/best-tax-services/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 10:08:00 GMT","Using tax services yourself to file is often the cheapest and most straightforward way to get your taxes finished—and get that refund on its way. Rather than going in person to a tax professional, which can be costly and time-consuming, online tax services are made with the consumer in mind. The best tax services have an easy-to-use interface, expert help available, auto-upload for documents, additional information about requirements, and transparency with cost.

With my utter lack of experience and complicated mess of documents, I might be the best guinea pig to see which online tax services are best for most types of filers. This year, I was a freelance writer for three different publications, across three states, with three types of tax documents. I also had two W-2s, the most common type of tax document, from two different employers. Oh, and I was also enrolled in a university, which brought a separate slew of education-related documents. The majority of my income did not have any taxes withheld, meaning I owe a lot of money. To add insult to injury, I had never done my taxes myself, either.

With no previous experience, nine tax documents across three states, and a dream, I bravely spent over 15 hours testing various online tax services to find which are truly the best for your buck. Still feeling lost? I’ve also written a handy guide, “How to Pay Your Taxes Online.”

https://wired.com,Why Adding a Full Hard Drive Can Make a Computer More Powerful,https://wired.com/story/catalytic-computing-taps-the-full-power-of-a-full-hard-drive/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","In the late 2000s, McKenzie and the pioneering complexity theorist Stephen Cook devised a problem that seemed like a promising candidate. Called the tree evaluation problem, it involves repeatedly solving a simpler math problem that turns a pair of input numbers into a single output. Copies of this math problem are arranged in layers like the matches in a tournament bracket: The outputs of each layer become the inputs to the next layer until there’s just one output remaining. Different tree evaluation algorithms represent different strategies for calculating this final output from the initial inputs—they might perform the calculations in a different order, or record the results of intermediate steps in a different way.

Many algorithms can solve the tree evaluation problem quickly, putting it in the class P. But every such algorithm must devote some memory to the numbers it’s working with, while also storing numbers it’s already calculated for use in later steps. That’s why Cook and McKenzie suspected that the problem was impossible to solve using limited memory. They formalized this intuition in a 2010 paper coauthored with three other researchers, and proved that every ordinary algorithm for solving the tree evaluation problem required too much memory to qualify for membership in L.

But their work didn’t rule out the possibility of bizarre algorithms that could somehow use the same piece of memory for storage and calculations simultaneously—the computing equivalent of using a page filled with important notes as scratch paper. Cook and McKenzie thought such outlandish algorithms couldn’t exist, and they were confident enough to put money on it: Anyone who could prove them wrong would win a cool $100.

Catalytic Conversion

Michal Koucký, a complexity theorist at Charles University in Prague, learned about the tree evaluation result from Cook during a 2011 sabbatical in Toronto. He grew determined to finish what Cook and McKenzie had started, by proving that there’s no way to do additional computations using memory that’s saving data for later. Koucký’s quest would lead him on an unexpected detour to the discovery of catalytic computing. Nearly a decade later, that discovery would inspire two young researchers to return to tree evaluation and settle Cook and McKenzie’s bet once and for all.

But back to the story of catalytic computing. It all started when Koucký visited colleagues in Amsterdam and posed the question that had been preoccupying him in simpler terms: What can you do with memory that’s already full?

“Nothing” was the obvious answer. “I thought, ‘OK, this is of course very useless, and we’re going to prove it,’” said Harry Buhrman, the leader of the Amsterdam group. “And then we couldn’t prove it.”

Using an approach called catalytic computing, Harry Buhrman and Michal Koucký showed that even full memory could theoretically aid computation. Photograph: Bob Bronshoff/Quanta Magazine Photograph: Thomas Rubin/Quanta Magazine

The breakthrough came months later, when Buhrman was visiting his frequent collaborator Richard Cleve at the University of Waterloo. They decided to focus on an extreme scenario, one where the full memory is very large. If a computer with little free memory can access this massive full memory, would that enable it to solve problems that would be impossible with the free memory alone? It’s like the “hard drive full of family photos” question, but with a hard drive the size of a data center.

If that extra data is untouchable—you can’t interact with it at all—then it definitely doesn’t help. But what if you’re allowed to tweak some of the bits encoding this data, as long as you promise to reset them when you’re done? You can’t simply keep a record of your changes, since that would take up even more space, so instead you’ll have to ensure that your changes are easily reversible. What’s more, you don’t get to choose the content of the extra data, so whatever you do must work for any possible initial configuration of bits.",wired
https://wired.com,"The true nature of the mysterious ""high energy x-ray"" emitted from a white dwarf has been revealed.",https://wired.jp/article/white-dwarf-high-energy-x-ray-mystery/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT","Stars with masses less than eight times the solar mass will swell up significantly as they approach the end, lowering the surface temperature and appearing red. Stars that have reached this state are called ""red giants.""

The red giant stars release a large amount of gas into the surrounding area. The ""planetary nebula"" is a gas that appears to shine brightly when illuminated by the ultraviolet rays emitted by the central star.

The name includes ""planet"", but it has nothing to do with the planet. This was named by astronomer William Herschel (1738-1822) because when they were observed with a small telescope, they looked like planets when they were observed with a small telescope.

The central star, located in the heart of the planetary nebula, eventually cools down, leaving behind the exposed core of the former star. The core that shines through this residual heat is a ""white dwarf.""

Among these white dwarf stars, this time I would like to introduce a mysterious phenomenon related to WD 2226-210, which exists at the heart of the planetary nebula ""Spiral Nebula"" located in Aquarius. Researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico and other researchers recently discovered that this white dwarf will destroy a planet that revolved around its surroundings, and that the remains of it may fall to WD 2226-210, causing high-energy X-rays to be emitted.

Mysterious high-energy X-ray observed

The white dwarf ""WD 2226-210"" is located at the heart of the planetary nebula, about 650 light years from Earth. It was in 1980 that German X-ray observation satellite ROSAT and others observed the phenomenon of extremely high-energy X-ray emission from this white dwarf.

As of February 2024, Apple's number of active devices exceeded 2.2 billion. If you're reading this article, you might own one too. If Apple had made a laptop stand, it would have a simple and sophisticated design like that of Rain Design.

Apple devices are known for their simple and elegant designs, but Rain Design seems to understand the essence of their products. The Rain Design stands hide behind the supporting devices and do not interfere with your office decor. The finish also has an ""apple-like"" colour and texture.

Apple officially handles Twelve South stands, but personally I prefer the Rain Design stands. The Rain Design stand is a little cheaper and comes in a wide variety of styles and colors. Even if you replace your MacBook with a new model, the stand is sturdy enough to be usable as is.

Reliable stability

Among the Rain Design products, mStand is my favorite. Made from aluminum plates, it is sturdy. Designed with a wide base of 7.5 x 10 inches, it is one of the most stable PC stands I have ever tested.

The slots that can store external keyboards and mice are also very convenient. If you often work face-to-face while using a PC, choose the mStand360 and you will receive a swivel base. mStand also comes in a variety of options for iPhones and iPads.

The iLevel2 can be adjusted to height from 5.4 inches to 7.9 inches using the slider on the front. mTower is a stand that can store your MacBook vertically, making effective use of your desk space. This is useful if you are using an external monitor. And for those who plan to work at their desks but end up sitting on the sofa after lunch, the iLap (with a removable front cushion) is the perfect choice. As a lap desk, it is one of the most stable things. iRest is available for tablet devices.

A wide variety

The mBar Pro+ is a very good portable stand. The 5.5-inch height makes it just right for watching videos and typing. I leave it on my desk on days I don't carry it around, so I can use it right away.

The mBar Pro+ is compatible with most MacBooks, and also supports 9.7-inch iPads, 10.5-inch and 12.5-inch iPad Pros in landscape orientation. Folding it only costs 9.5 x 6 inches and weighs 205g.

Instead, you don't have the usual digital device, bring your Chromebook set to ""lockdown"" mode and an iPhone set to sync with another non-sensitive Apple account.

Lucky is a Seattle-based security researcher and also serves as the chief security officer for a cryptocurrency insurance company. Before departing (to a country with security concerns), data is always deleted from both devices and uploaded only the minimum necessary data. Furthermore, they have electronic devices divided by country so that they can forensic analysis of devices upon return to Japan to check for signs of tampering with each country.

However, currently, Russia and China are not the only countries that require such a paranoia. The United States could also be the subject of this. It's for anyone who owns a foreign passport, even if they're not like Lucky. This is because the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) could face increasingly strict and unpredictable surveillance.

""If I think I'm likely to be a target, I'll take equal levels of protection,"" Lucky said.

Surge in infringement under the Trump administration

Since the start of the second Trump administration, foreign travelers visiting the United States have been denied entry. There are increasing numbers of cases where people are sent back to where they come or are detained. Reports have been raised that when trying to enter the United States from the UK or France, they have been detained for several weeks or denied entry, in some cases. Some of them included individuals who said they were legal US residents who hold green cards.

According to the French Minister of Higher Education and Research, the reason why a French researcher was denied entry was because the US Immigration Bureau looked into the researcher's mobile phone and found an exchange that ""expressed personal opinions on the Trump administration's research policies.""

German and British authorities have changed travel guidelines as US visas and travel permit regulations have become stricter. The UK warns that the new rules will be enacted ""strictly.""

If the Trump administration implements plans to impose new ""travel bans"" on more than 40 countries, crackdowns on borders would effectively become much more explicit. The plan reports that a complete ban on entry from at least 10 countries, and new surveillance and interviews will be conducted at the border for travelers from five more countries. In addition, 26 countries will be classified into third categories, and responses to this category will be decided within 60 days of the policy's entry into force.

All of these changes show that the US border is becoming a much more unfriendly place for foreigners and Americans returning from abroad. And there is no doubt that enforcement measures at the new border will become an aggressive surveillance system that extends to travelers' electronic devices. This is a threat to digital privacy and freedom of expression for both foreigners and US residents.

https://wired.com,Learn from the flight of birds to guide future aircraft to stable flight,https://wired.jp/article/airplanes-of-the-future-could-be-fitted-with-feather-like-flaps/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","But over time, aerospace engineers began to think that there was no need to observe nature. There are millions of flying insects, over 1,400 bats and over 10,000 bird species, but most of them have not been studied. ""I know what the name, the eggs they lay and their habitat, but I don't know how they'll fly,"" Lentink says. He emphasizes this as a major loss of opportunity. This is because researching animal flight allows researchers to come up with ideas that are not bound by preconceived concepts. It could bring new perspectives on how animals encounter and adapt to new physical conditions during flight.

Effects of flap placement and number

Wissa noticed that previous research had examined the contribution to the single flap and airflow inspired by rain covering feathers. However, birds do not have a single row of rain cover feathers, but have multiple rows of rain cover feathers that influence each other. Few studies have been conducted to understand these interactions, the physics behind the effects on airflow, and how to incorporate flaps into aircraft.

Wissa's team first installed a hinged flap at different positions on the top of the wing. A wind tunnel was used to measure aerodynamic forces and airflow velocity around the wing. ""We placed the flaps in different locations and the airflow was clearly altered, giving us an advantage in lift,"" explains Sedokey. I realized that by simply increasing the number of flaps, these effects can be amplified.

The team then began studying multi-row flaps to see if the aerodynamic benefits could be amplified. It was then found that the addition of flaps enhances certain airflow mechanisms. To test this effect on an actual prototype, we investigated materials suitable for installation. To reproduce the natural hardness and mass of the rain cover feathers, we decided to use a lightweight, flexible plastic film. ""The goal was to simplify the transition from biology to engineering,"" Wissa says. The flaps were carefully tape mounted on the model plane to ensure proper material and placement. This is because if it is too stiff or too heavy, the flap will not open.

Wissa and her colleagues tested the flap in certain circumstances, including emergency landings on short runways and encountering gusts of wind. Maintaining control when the wings are at a high angle to the incoming air is important not only to stability, but also to prevent the aircraft from stalling. Testing the flaps with wind tunnels and prototypes revealed that lift is increased by up to 45% compared to the absence of the flap, and resistance is reduced by about 31%, helping to prevent sudden lift loss, which causes stall.

A long road to implementing innovation

These findings could have immense significance for the future of the aviation industry. Climate change makes weather conditions more unpredictable and harsh. Over the past 40 years, the frequency of extreme turbulence has increased by 55%. To ensure passenger safety, aircraft must be more durable and be able to operate with ease even in harsh conditions without compromising stability and passenger safety.",wired

Today, Bluesky’s social network has grown to over 33 million users, while the technology it’s built upon — the AT Protocol (or ATProto for short) — is being used to develop dozens more applications designed to work together as part of an open social web.

The developers behind many of these apps attended the first conference dedicated to the AT Protocol, ATmosphere, held in Seattle last weekend. There, they learned what’s ahead for ATProto, what challenges still need to be overcome, and what other things they’ll need to think about as they build for this new social app ecosystem. Others attended online, watched the talks and presentations remotely, and participated in a growing Discord chat for community members.

The ATProto community is working to rebuild Web 2.0, an earlier version of the social web that included social media websites, blogs, wikis, video- and photo-sharing sites, and other collaborative and hosted services. Except this time around, the apps are being built on open technology, not siloed into centralized services that tend to be operated by tech giants.

Bluesky was the first of these services to emerge, but if the open social web movement has any staying power, it won’t be the last.

Below is a list of AT Protocol-based, consumer-facing apps that are either built on top of Bluesky or its underlying protocol, allowing users to take back control over their social networking experiences and personal data. Many of these are still in early development but showcase the potential for what’s ahead in this expanding ecosystem.

Launched publicly at the end of February, Flashes grabbed 30,000 downloads in its first 24 hours for offering a classic Instagram experience. Users can upload up to four photos or videos of up to 3 minutes in length, up from 1 minute previously, thanks to an update Bluesky released. The app offers photo filters, curated feeds from artists, custom feeds, and a Portfolio Mode where photographers can showcase their work.

Spark

Spark (originally called Reelo) is a video-first app that is built on top of the AT Protocol, not just Bluesky. That allows the app to differentiate itself with a broader feature set that will include support for longer videos, filters, effects, a music library, and, eventually, livestreaming.

Skylight Social

Built by Seattle-based co-founders Victoria (“Tori”) White and Reed Harmeyer, Skylight is built on top of Bluesky, offering features such as likes, follows, comments, and profile pages. Users can follow the app’s active development on its co-founder’s TikTok page as the team adds more features, including video support.

The app is in testing on iOS and Android.

Pinksky

Pinksky is another one of many apps trying to build an alternative to Instagram using ATProto. Built by developer Ramon Souza, the app is available on both iOS and Android and will focus mainly on photo-sharing, like classic Instagram did. The app offers similar features to Instagram, including user profiles, a feed of photos and videos, and a Stories section where posts remain visible for 24 hours.

Bluescreen (TikTok alternative)

Bluescreen, also built by Vogelsang, is an upcoming app that will focus on videos posted to the Bluesky social network.

Videos for Bluesky

The generically named Videos for Bluesky is another app built on top of Bluesky from “MszPro,” aka Hoshida Takiyoshi, an indie Japanese developer. Like others, Videos for Bluesky lets you browse videos posted to the Bluesky social network by vertically scrolling in a TikTok-like user interface with familiar Like, Repost, and Reply buttons.

Livestreaming

Streamplace

Image Credits:Streamplace

Streamplace is the first livestreaming video service built on top of the AT Protocol. The service, which was recently used to livestream the ATmosphere conference in Seattle, offers a familiar streaming experience with support for high-quality videos, livestreaming, clips, and uploads. All the video content is also cryptographically signed by creators and respects their consent preferences. It is built on the same public key infrastructure as decentralized social networks.

Founded by Eli Mallon, Streamplace was initially backed by his previous employer, Livepeer (another decentralized video platform), which operated a crypto treasury where funds are invested into other projects. That allowed him to get Streamplace off the ground. Now he sees potential in building out a technology that could appeal to creators like Twitch streamers, who would rather connect directly with fans through their own app or website instead of having to split their revenue with Twitch owner Amazon.

Feed builders

Graze

Graze is a startup that lets you easily build, customize, publish, and manage Bluesky feeds and, eventually, monetize them with ads, sponsored posts, and subscriptions. The service is working with the Bluesky firehose, aka the Jetstream, which includes all the public posts on the social network.

Surf

Image Credits:Flipboard/Surf

Flipboard’s newest app, Surf, lets you build your own custom feeds from across the open web, including not only Bluesky but also Mastodon, RSS, and more. That means you can mix in news articles, blog posts, podcasts, and YouTube feeds into the custom feeds you build in Surf, alongside social posts. You can then use Surf to browse your feeds and others from the community across a range of topics and interests. Surf is still in private beta testing, but a signup list is available.

SkyFeed

A web-based, TweetDeck-like client for Bluesky, SkyFeed lets you create a dashboard of your feeds and profiles. However, most of its users come to SkyFeed because it also offers an easy way for even nondevelopers to build custom feeds based on lists or regexes.

Communication / social discovery

Germ

Image Credits:Germ

Germ’s big idea is not just to offer an alternative to your phone messages, like Signal, but to build a social platform where you could discover and connect with others for any reason: marketplace exchanges, dating, social networking, and more. However, it would be one where you were in control of the data you were sharing and could stop that sharing at any time.

Currently an end-to-end encrypted messenger that you can download from the App Store, Germ lets you build and share multiple identities. Plus, you can start chatting with someone on Germ even if they don’t have the app installed, thanks to its use of Apple’s App Clips technology. This allows you to have a lightweight app experience on your iPhone before you download the full application from the App Store.

Germ was founded by writer and Stanford lecturer Tessa Brown (CEO) and former Apple privacy engineer Mark Xue (CTO). The team is now working on a Bluesky integration that would allow users to chat securely with their Bluesky friends.

Roomy

Image Credits:Roomy

A peer-to-peer messaging app built on the AT Protocol, Roomy is similar in some ways to Discord but taps into open standards. For instance, ATProto is used for social discovery, while Automerge is used for peer-to-peer discovery. The app is backed by funding from Skyseed and is currently in alpha testing.

You can log into Roomy with your Bluesky account and direct message other users to engage in chats. The messages are encrypted, but this is an experimental project and not audited, so be aware. Plus, some non-encrypted metadata shows who you were talking to but not the contents of those messages. (In other words, don’t swap out Signal for Roomy yet.)

Social Trends

Dazzle.fm

Image Credits:Dazzle.fm

Founded by former Stability AI engineer John Sabath, Dazzle offers a website that makes sense of the firehose of data from Bluesky and organizes it into categories, highlighting the trends across various topics. While much of the early discussion on Bluesky today leans political, Dazzle’s site can help you find other topics and conversations taking place.

Dazzle lets you give it instructions to tune the site to your own interests, too. You could ask it to show you a topic but without any posts featuring political discussions, for example. That means you could use Dazzle to show you local news, but not national politics, or you could keep your experience focused only on those who are posting with a positive sentiment.

The idea is that you’ll be able to switch between these different modes, generated using AI technology, without actually having to build custom feeds. Instead, you can just type in what you want to see (or not see) into a chat-like interface, then have Dazzle reconfigure itself to offer you posts that match whatever “vibe” you had just requested.

Sill

Image Credits:Sill

Link aggregation service Sill lets you keep up with what everyone’s talking about on alternative social media sites like Bluesky and Mastodon in one place. The service is similar to the older startup Nuzzel, which was acquired by Twitter as part of its deal for Scroll in 2021, then integrated into Twitter’s app. Popular with news junkies, Nuzzel helped users keep track of what everyone on Twitter was talking about, reading, and resharing that day.

Sill is also among the early adopters using Bluesky’s OAuth for the AT Protocol instead of app passwords, making it easier to log in. Once connected, you’ll see the most shared links across your services and the resulting conversations.

Frontpage

Image Credits:Frontpage.fyi

A decentralized and federated link aggregator built on ATProto, Frontpage offers a simple interface for organizing and upvoting interesting posts and links being shared across the social network. It also supports commenting and notifications.

Alternative Bluesky Clients

Skeets

Also by Vogelsang, Skeets is an alternative to Bluesky’s main app that’s optimized for accessibility and works well on both iPhone and iPad.

Deck.blue

Another TweetDeck-style web app, Deck.blue lets you fill your screen with columns featuring your Home feed, Notifications, custom feeds, lists, and more. The app also supports multiple accounts and the scheduling of posts.

Image Credits:deck.blue screenshot

Events

Smoke Signal

An event and RSVP management system, Smoke Signal is the Bluesky alternative to something like Eventbrite or Facebook Events. Built on top of ATProto, Smoke Signal supports OAuth, allowing users to discover communities and create and RSVP to events while also keeping hold of their own personal data.

Blogging

White Wind

A Markdown blogging service for the AT Protocol, White Wind lets you use your ATProto account to log in, then write in Markdown. The service includes tools for uploading images, previewing your post, and more, with everything stored in your account’s PDS (personal data service). When you post on Bluesky, those replies are included on your blog automatically.

Analytics

BlueSkyHunter

Largely a growth and analytics toolset for Bluesky, BlueSkyHunter also offers a way to tap into trends on the social network. One section in the app called Viral Posts showcases the more popular posts. This could help content planners pick up on trends and memes or find templates that are popular with other users that they could adopt.

Fedica

Fedica offers an online dashboard that allows you to compose and schedule posts across social networks, including Bluesky, Threads, X, Mastodon, and Pixelfed, among others. It also supports more traditional social apps like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, and YouTube. Included in its plans are a variety of features for social listening, tools for tracking hashtags, keywords, and post reach, as well as those for follower analysis.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,"The hottest AI models, what they do, and how to use them",https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/30/the-hottest-ai-models-what-they-do-and-how-to-use-them/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","AI models are being cranked out at a dizzying pace, by everyone from Big Tech companies like Google to startups like OpenAI and Anthropic. Keeping track of the latest ones can be overwhelming.

Adding to the confusion is that AI models are often promoted based on industry benchmarks. But these technical metrics often reveal little about how real people and companies actually use them.

To cut through the noise, TechCrunch has compiled an overview of the most advanced AI models released since 2024, with details on how to use them and what they’re best for. We’ll keep this list updated with the latest launches, too.

There are literally over a million AI models out there: Hugging Face, for example, hosts over 1.4 million. So this list might miss some models that perform better, in one way or another.

AI models released in 2025

Google Gemini 2.5

Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, a reasoning model, excels at building web apps and code agents according to Google. It underperforms on one popular coding benchmark compared to Claude Sonnet 3.7, however. The model requires a $20 monthly Gemini Advanced subscription.

ChatGPT-4o image generator

OpenAI has upgraded its existing GPT-4o model to generate images, not just text. The souped-up model soon went viral for transforming images into Studio Ghibli-style anime, despite obvious copyright concerns. Accessing GPT-4o requires, at minimum, a $20 per month ChatGPT Plus subscription.

Stability AI’s Stable Virtual Camera

Image generation startup Stability AI has launched a model that the company says can generate 3D scenes and camera angles from a single 2D image. However, it still struggles with scenes featuring more complex elements like humans and moving water. The model is available for noncommercial research use on HuggingFace.

Cohere’s Aya Vision

Cohere released a multimodal model called Aya Vision that it claims is best in class at doing things like captioning images and answering questions about photos. It also excels in languages other than English, unlike other models, Cohere claims. It is available for free on WhatsApp.

OpenAI’s GPT 4.5 “Orion”

OpenAI calls Orion their largest model to date, touting its strong “world knowledge” and “emotional intelligence.” However, it underperforms on certain benchmarks compared to newer reasoning models. Orion is available to subscribers of OpenAI’s $200-per-month plan.

Claude Sonnet 3.7

Anthropic says this is the industry’s first “hybrid” reasoning model, because it can both fire off quick answers and really think things through when needed. It also gives users control over how long the model can think for, per Anthropic. Sonnet 3.7 is available to all Claude users, but heavier users will need a $20-per-month Pro plan.

xAI’s Grok 3

Grok 3 is the latest flagship model from Elon Musk-founded startup xAI. It’s claimed to outperform other leading models on math, science, and coding. The model requires X Premium (which is $50 per month.) After one study found Grok 2 leaned left, Musk pledged to shift Grok more “politically neutral” but it’s not yet clear if that’s been achieved.

OpenAI o3-mini

This is OpenAI’s latest reasoning model and is optimized for STEM-related tasks like coding, math, and science. It’s not OpenAI’s most powerful model but because it’s smaller, the company says it’s significantly lower cost. It is available for free but requires a subscription for heavy users.

OpenAI Deep Research

OpenAI’s Deep Research is designed for doing in-depth research on a topic with clear citations. This service is only available with ChatGPT’s $200-per-month Pro subscription. OpenAI recommends it for everything from science to shopping research, but beware that hallucinations remain a problem for AI.

Mistral Le Chat

Mistral has launched app versions of Le Chat, a multimodal AI personal assistant. Mistral claims Le Chat responds faster than any other chatbot. It also has a paid version with up-to-date journalism from the AFP. Tests from Le Monde found Le Chat’s performance impressive, although it made more errors than ChatGPT.

OpenAI Operator

OpenAI’s Operator is meant to be a personal intern that can do things independently, like help you buy groceries. It requires a $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro subscription. AI agents hold a lot of promise, but they’re still experimental: A Washington Post reviewer says Operator decided on its own to order a dozen eggs for $31, paid with the reviewer’s credit card.

Google Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental

Google Gemini’s much-awaited flagship model says it excels at coding and understanding general knowledge. It also has a super-long context window of 2 million tokens, helping users who need to quickly process massive chunks of text. The service requires (at minimum) a Google One AI Premium subscription of $19.99 a month.

AI models released in 2024

DeepSeek R1

This Chinese AI model took Silicon Valley by storm. DeepSeek’s R1 performs well on coding and math, while its open source nature means anyone can run it locally. Plus, it’s free. However, R1 integrates Chinese government censorship and faces rising bans for potentially sending user data back to China.

Gemini Deep Research

Deep Research summarizes Google’s search results in a simple and well-cited document. The service is helpful for students and anyone else who needs a quick research summary. However, its quality isn’t nearly as good as an actual peer-reviewed paper. Deep Research requires a $19.99 Google One AI Premium subscription.

Meta Llama 3.3 70B

This is the newest and most advanced version of Meta’s open source Llama AI models. Meta has touted this version as its cheapest and most efficient yet, especially for math, general knowledge, and instruction following. It is free and open source.

OpenAI Sora

Sora is a model that creates realistic videos based on text. While it can generate entire scenes rather than just clips, OpenAI admits that it often generates “unrealistic physics.” It’s currently only available on paid versions of ChatGPT, starting with Plus, which is $20 a month.

Alibaba Qwen QwQ-32B-Preview

This model is one of the few to rival OpenAI’s o1 on certain industry benchmarks, excelling in math and coding. Ironically for a “reasoning model,” it has “room for improvement in common sense reasoning,” Alibaba says. It also incorporates Chinese government censorship, TechCrunch testing shows. It’s free and open source.

Anthropic’s Computer Use

Claude’s Computer Use is meant to take control of your computer to complete tasks like coding or booking a plane ticket, making it a predecessor of OpenAI’s Operator. Computer use, however, remains in beta. Pricing is via API: $0.80 per million tokens of input and $4 per million tokens of output.

xAI’s Grok 2

Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, has launched an enhanced version of its flagship Grok 2 chatbot it claims is “three times faster.” Free users are limited to 10 questions every two hours on Grok, while subscribers to X’s Premium and Premium+ plans enjoy higher usage limits. xAI also launched an image generator, Aurora, that produces highly photorealistic images, including some graphic or violent content.

OpenAI o1

OpenAI’s o1 family is meant to produce better answers by “thinking” through responses through a hidden reasoning feature. The model excels at coding, math, and safety, OpenAI claims, but has issues with trying to deceive humans, too. Using o1 requires subscribing to ChatGPT Plus, which is $20 a month.

Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.5

Claude Sonnet 3.5 is a model Anthropic claims as being best in class. It’s become known for its coding capabilities and is considered a tech insider’s chatbot of choice. The model can be accessed for free on Claude, although heavy users will need a $20 monthly Pro subscription. While it can understand images, it can’t generate them.

OpenAI GPT 4o-mini

OpenAI has touted GPT 4o-mini as its most affordable and fastest model yet, thanks to its small size. It’s meant to enable a broad range of tasks like powering customer service chatbots. The model is available on ChatGPT’s free tier. It’s better suited for high-volume simple tasks compared to more complex ones.

Cohere Command R+

Cohere’s Command R+ model excels at complex retrieval-augmented generation (or RAG) applications for enterprises. That means it can find and cite specific pieces of information really well. (The inventor of RAG actually works at Cohere.) Still, RAG doesn’t fully solve AI’s hallucination problem.",techcrunch
https://techcrunch.com,China Miéville says we shouldn’t blame science fiction for its bad readers,https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/30/author-china-mieville-says-we-shouldnt-blame-science-fiction-for-its-bad-readers/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","It’s been 25 years since China Miéville stepped into the literary spotlight with his novel “Perdido Street Station.”

Combining elements of science fiction, fantasy, and horror, the novel introduced readers to the fantastically complex city of New Crobuzon, filled with insect-headed khepri, cactus-shaped cactacae, and terrifying slake moths that feed on their victims’ dreams. It also sparked broader interest in what became known as the “new weird.”

After “Perdido”’s success (commemorated this year with a quickly-sold-out collector’s edition from The Folio Society), Miéville continued to meld genres in novels like “The City and the City” and “Embassytown.” But he stopped publishing fiction for nearly a decade, only to reemerge last year with The New York Times bestseller “The Book of Elsewhere,” co-written with Keanu Reeves. (Yes, that Keanu Reeves.)

Miéville is also a compelling observer and critic — of politics, of cities, of science fiction and fantasy. So while we started our conversation by discussing his breakthrough book, I also took the opportunity to ask about the relationship between science fiction and the real world, particularly what seems to be a growing tendency among tech billionaires to treat the science fiction they grew up reading as a blueprint for their future plans.

To Miéville, it’s a mistake to read science fiction as if it’s really about the future: “It’s always about now. It’s always a reflection. It’s a kind of fever dream, and it’s always about its own sociological context.”

He added that there’s a “societal and personal derangement” at work when the rich and powerful “are more interested in settling Mars than sorting out the world” — but ultimately, it’s not science fiction that’s responsible.

“Let’s not blame science fiction for this,” he said. “It’s not science fiction that’s causing this kind of sociopathy.”

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

First of all, congratulations on 25 years of “Perdido Street Station.” I was in high school when it first came out, and I have this very vivid memory of ditching school so I could finish the book, and then being very upset with how it ended.

Thank you for telling me — both that I upset you and that you read it.

It’s very strange. Like everyone who’s my age, all I can really think is, “I don’t understand how I’m this age.” So the idea that I’ve done anything that could be 25 years old, let alone this book, is giddying to me.

In the afterword [to the new collector’s edition], you talk about this being a young man’s book. Was this also a book written in the spirit of, “I don’t like the way commercial fantasy looks right now, let me show you how it’s done”?

I mean, not as programmatically as that. That makes it sound like it was a more self-conscious intervention than it was, and it definitely wasn’t that.

What is true is that I always loved the fantastic, but I did not much like a lot of the commercially massive fantasies. And I was never much of a [J.R.R.] Tolkien fan. Most of the very successful fantasies that were obviously highly derived from Tolkien, they did nothing for me.

Whereas that Dying Earth tradition, or that science fantasy tradition, or the tradition out of New Worlds [magazine], the post-[Michael] Moorcock tradition was always much more up my street — combined, obviously, with people like [Mervyn] Peake and so on.

So it was more a question for me of saying, “I love fantasy, and this is the kind of fantasy I love.” I’m not saying I did something new, but for whatever reasons, there’s tides in publishing and taste and so on.

So yes, it was a repudiation of a certain tradition, but not a deliberate act of flag waving in that way, if that makes sense. I always felt myself highly located within a tradition, just a tradition that wasn’t quite getting the attention that the [Tolkien] tradition was getting at the time.

The movement of the various weird genres into the mainstream, or this dissolving of the barriers between them, has brought some of the writers you care deeply about into the limelight. But have there been any downsides?

Sure. This, to me, is what happens with all subcultures. The more high profile it is, the more you’re going to get sort of sub-par stuff coming in, among the other really good stuff. It’s going to become commodified. Not that it was ever not [commodified], but let’s say, even more so. There will be a kind of cheapening. You end up with kind of Cthulhu plushies, all this stuff. And you can drive yourself mad with this.

It happened with drum and bass. It happened with surrealism. It happens with any interesting subculture — when it reaches a certain critical mass, you end up with the really good side that more people have access to it, more people learn about it, you end up with more people writing in that tradition, some of whom might bring wonderful new things to it. You also end up with the idea that there’s often a banalization. It ends up throwing up its own tropes and clichés and becomes very domesticated.

And this happened with science fiction. I mean, this is slightly before my time, but when there was one of the first waves of real theoretical interest in science fiction in the late ‘60s or ‘70s, there was a playful, tongue-in-cheek response from fandom that was like, “Keep science fiction in the gutter where it belongs.” And this, to me, is the endless dialectic between subculture and success. You’re never going to solve it.

I remember my high school self and college self, who was clutching “Perdido Street Station”or Philip K. Dick or Ursula Le Guin and saying, “You guys don’t understand, this is so good.” I had that evangelical fire. And when someone acts like that with science fiction now, I think, “Guys, we won. You don’t need to do that anymore.”

And I also feel something, because I’m awful: Now people are reading those authors, and they don’t deserve them. They don’t get it. They didn’t do the work.

There is an obvious way in which that kind of nerd gatekeeping is just purely toxic, that is absolutely flatly true. I have also had quite interesting conversations with people my age and younger about whether there is anything genuinely culturally positive about when you had to work to be in a subculture. I don’t mean work like, go mining. But you had to travel across town, you had to find out, you had to know who to ask. And I am tentatively of the mind that we have actually lost something by the absolute availability of everything if you can be bothered to click it.

I’m not saying there are no positives. I think there are enormous positives, but I think it would be facile to deny that there are also negatives. I’m tempted by the arguments that the easiness of all cultural availability does lose a certain intensity, at least potentially, to a certain set of subcultures.

I would say that very, very carefully, because I’m trying out ideas. But maybe one could argue that that’s the rational kernel of the appalling nerd police tendency.

That leads to something else I wanted to ask about. Maybe this has always happened, but I’ve noticed more tech industry folks like Elon Musk talking about science fiction and treating Isaac Asimov or Kim Stanley Robinson as sort of a blueprint for the future in ways that I’m not crazy about. Is that something you’ve noticed too?

First of all, one should just say, one can only feel deep sorrow for Kim Stanley Robinson — that is something he doesn’t deserve.

The Silicon Valley ideology has always been a weird, queasy mix of libertarianism, hippieness, granola crunch tech utopianism — hashtag #NotAllSilicon Valley, but really, actually, quite a f—ing lot of Silicon Valley.

And all ideologies are always weird mixes of different things, often completely contradictory things. And then what is stressed at any moment is a response to political pressures and economic circumstances and so on.

So it’s no secret, and it’s not new, that Silicon Valley has long been interested in science fiction. And to some extent, this is sociological. There’s a crossover of the literary nerd world and the computer world and so on.

And I agree with you on several levels. One is, even though some science fiction writers do think in terms of their writing being either a utopian blueprint or a dystopian warning, I don’t think that’s what science fiction ever is. It’s always about now. It’s always a reflection. It’s a kind of fever dream, and it’s always about its own sociological context. It’s always an expression of the anxieties of the now. So there’s a category error in treating it as if it is “about the future.”

And then there’s a whole series of other category errors whereby, because it’s a cultural form that is already always aestheticized, that can lead into a kind of fetishization very, very easily, which is why the slippage between a utopia and a dystopia is very easy to do. You end up with this structural disingenuousness.

Notionally, to say something like “Neuromancer” — and this is not me dissing “Neuromancer,” which I think is a wonderful book. But when people talk about it as this terrible warning, there’s a part of you — especially as a teenager, which to some degree or other, all science fiction people are — you’re like, “Oh yeah, it’s a terrible warning that we’re all going to get to wear mirrorshades and be fantastically cool?” So something that purports to be negative and a warning [can actually be] a deeply desirable thing.

But most obviously: What elements of science fiction are these people going to be interested in? They’re not going to be “inspired by,” for their products, the kind of visions of someone like Ursula Le Guin in “Always Coming Home,” which is precisely about moving out of the dead hand of the commodity. That’s of no use to them.

Now, that does not preclude their nimbleness in maybe being able to find ways to commodify exactly that. But the fact that some of these people are serious that they are more interested in settling Mars than sorting out the world — this is a very obvious point, but what kind of societal and personal derangement has happened that that actually makes sense?

And I say this as someone who loves Mars-settling novels. I love this stuff. But the idea that you would, rather than say, “This is a really interesting novel, this provides the following thoughts, maybe this inspires me to do certain kinds of work,” but that you would say, “Yes, that’s what we should do,” while around you, the world is spiraling into s—t? It would be terrifying if it wasn’t so risible.

Let’s not blame science fiction for this. It’s not science fiction that’s causing this kind of sociopathy. Sorry to be hack, but it’s capitalism.

A big part of my response when I see something like that is to think, “You guys are bad readers, and you’re just fixated on the gadgets, as opposed to the more interesting or radical political or social notions.” But on some level, I also think, “Are they just subscribing to this ur-narrative that a lot of science fiction sells: Won’t it be great when we go to Mars? Won’t it be great to expand outward and colonize forever?” And I guess I’m wondering to what extent that should spur science fiction writers to try to tell different kinds of narratives.

I mean, I’m not the cop. People can tell any kind of story they want. I reserve the right to criticize them and critique them.

I should say, by the way, I completely agree with you about bad reading, but I also just think that writers and critics, no matter how brilliant we may be, we don’t own the books. They are always a collaboration. And all books, particularly the most interesting fiction, [are] always going to have contradictory threads.

Where I maybe get a little bit hesitant about the idea — I’m not saying you’re saying this, but there can be an implicit literary causality model in this whereby, if we tell the right stories, then we will stop these people making these mistakes. And I just don’t think art works that way.

Artists are often very in thrall to a kind of artistic exceptionalism, where they like to justify their work as, on some level, a relatively direct political intervention. Or indeed, sometimes you hear people talk about [art] as activism, and I just don’t think it is.

My feeling is: I don’t think there is a story we can tell which someone who — because of the structural position they’re in, as well as maybe their psychology, but those two are not unrelated — I don’t think there’s a story we can tell that they are not going to be able to say, “Yes, what this tells me is, I should make loads of money and be fantastically powerful, whatever it takes.” I don’t think we can do that.

None of this means that I’m not interested in books that do tell interesting stories and untold stories and radical stories and so on. I absolutely am, and if people come to them and are radicalized by them, great. But that, I think, is fundamentally not something we can hope for.

I would like us to be writing more interesting stories as a function of the fact that the world was getting better. I do not think that by us writing different stories, we’re going to make the world better. I just don’t think that’s the line of causality. There are simply too many layers of mediation from a book up into the social system.

Getting back to your own writing, I know there have been whispers about a big new book coming from you. It sounds like it’s going to be out next year?

Yes, it will be out. I don’t know the exact date, but it will be out before the end of next year. I’m just doing the last bits on it now.

Is there anything you can say about it?

I will just say that I’ve been working on it for 20 years, and that’s not an exaggeration. I’ve been working on this book for considerably more than half of my adult life, and it is a very big deal for me, for it to be coming out. I’m very excited for it.

Anything else you want to conclude with?

This is for TechCrunch, isn’t it? I think social media is one of the worst things to happen to humanity for a long time, but I’m hardly radical for saying that. I know everyone’s like, “Oh ha ha, it’s awful, I’m addicted.” But I really do increasingly feel like, “No, this is making us sick. This is destroying our brains.”

That’s been good news for companies like Nvidia, but it has also led to unprecedented growth in the power industry.

New and expanded data centers are expected to double the sector’s power demand by 2029, according to JLL. As a result, developers and tech companies have been working overtime to lock in capacity. Nuclear and natural gas have gotten boosts from the forecasted demand, but few technologies have benefited in the near term like solar.

Though solar power suffers from what experts call intermittency — it won’t produce if the sun isn’t shining — the upsides have been so significant that companies have been inking large deals at a rapid pace.

Unlike advanced nuclear reactors, which have yet to be deployed at commercial scale, solar power is proven technology. And unlike new natural gas power plants, which take years to plan and construct, the average completion time for a new solar farm is about 18 months. Plus, it’s one of the lowest-cost sources of new generating capacity.

Since the start of 2025, tech companies and data center operators have backed 12 solar deals, each adding more than 100 megawatts of capacity to the grid.

January

Meta kicked off the year with a 200-megawatt solar deal with multinational electric utility Engie. The purchase went toward a solar farm near one of the company’s existing data centers in Texas. At the time of the deal, Meta already had over 12 gigawatts of generating capacity in its renewable portfolio.

Later in January, the Stargate AI partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank Group was reported by Bloomberg to be powered, at least in part, by solar. SB Energy, which is part of SoftBank’s portfolio, is expected to develop solar installations backed by grid-scale batteries.

Meta closed out the month with another massive solar deal, this one with Spanish renewable developer Zelestra. The contract was for 595 megawatts of capacity.

February

Meta continued its streak in February, investing in a 505-megawatt solar project with Cypress Creek Renewables, which is developing the massive installation in Coleman County, Texas — about 150 miles northwest of Austin.

Microsoft entered the fray in February, too. The company has long been a buyer of renewable energy to power its operations, and added another 389 megawatts of solar in a deal with EDP Renewables North America. The contract covers three different solar farms, two in Illinois and one in Texas. The purchases have helped Microsoft stay on top of its pledge to power its operations using zero carbon power.

Amazon also made a big purchase, backing a hybrid project on the Iberian Peninsula that includes wind, solar, and pumped-hydroelectric storage. The deal included 476 megawatts total, of which 212 megawatts are solar.

Outside of the U.S., data center operators have also been investing in solar. In India, CtrlS built its own 125-megawatt facility in two phases, the first half of which was finished in June 2024 with the second completed in early February. In South America, Telecom Argentina agreed to buy electricity from a 130-megawatt solar farm developed by MSU Green Energy.

March

Microsoft added another three solar developments in March, again focusing on the Midwest. The projects span Illinois, Michigan, and Missouri, and they’re being developed by AES. Together, they will provide Microsoft with 475 megawatts of capacity, adding to its considerable 34-gigawatt portfolio.

Cisco got in the game with a 100-megawatt deal with X-Elio, a solar developer owned by Brookfield, an asset manager that has bet big on renewables. The power purchase agreements see Cisco buying capacity from two different Texas solar projects.

Meta added another 200 megawatts of solar to its portfolio in March in a deal with RWE. The solar farm will be built just southeast of Austin.

In Italy, data center operator Data4 signed a 10-year deal with utility Edison Energia to buy power from a 148-megawatt solar farm northwest of Rome.

More deals likely

As tech companies race to add AI to seemingly every product and possible market, data centers have been expanding to keep pace. That growth requires power, and few technologies are as well positioned as solar power.

Utility-scale solar is already one of the cheapest forms of new generating capacity without counting subsidies, undercutting everything except onshore wind. It’s also quick to deploy and can be commissioned in phases, allowing data centers to draw power before the entire project is finished.

Those qualities have combined to give solar a near-term advantage, racking up deals with Big Tech companies and data center developers. It’s a trend that’s likely to continue.",techcrunch

Last weekend, Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, found himself at the center of a digital fiasco when he was unexpectedly added to a Signal group chat with 17 U.S. government officials who were discussing imminent airstrikes in Yemen. For some, the incident has raised questions about how phone numbers end up in contact lists and how messaging apps pull in users.

National security adviser Mike Waltz on Wednesday stated that Goldberg’s number was “sucked in” from another contact. On a Sunday talk show, Goldberg pushed back, saying, “This isn’t The Matrix. Phone numbers don’t just get sucked into other phones.” Goldberg added, “My phone number was in his phone because my phone number is in his phone.”

Signal’s typically outspoken president Meredith Whittaker has not directly addressed the national security snafu, but earlier in the week, she took to X, writing that, “Right now there are a lot of new eyes on Signal, and not all of them are familiar with secure messaging and its nuances.” She went on to describe and defend the service, calling it the “gold standard for private, secure communications.”

Apple is developing a new version of its Health app that includes an AI coach that can advise users on how to get healthier, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

Gurman first reported that something like this was in the works back in 2023, but now he says development is moving ahead, with the new features potentially coming as soon as spring or summer of 2026, with the release of iOS 19.4.

The AI coach’s advice would be based on data from across users’ medical devices, and would reportedly include food tracking. The coach is currently being trained on data from staff physicians, with Apple looking to bring in additional doctors to record health-related videos.

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas recently took to Reddit to address users’ product complaints and reassure them that the company is not under serious financial pressure.

Srinivas seemed to be responding, in part, to a user theory that the company is “doing horribly financially” and “making lots of changes to cut costs.” As an example, the theorizer pointed to Perplexity’s Auto mode, where the AI search engine automatically selects the model with which to answer a user’s prompt.

On the contrary, Srinivas said Perplexity created Auto mode because “all AI products right now are shipping non-stop and adding a ton of buttons and dropdown menus and clutter,” which he said is “not sustainable.”

“The user shouldn’t have to learn so much to use a product,” he said.

As for whether Perplexity is facing pressure to cut costs or IPO, Srinivas said, “We have all the funding we’ve raised, and our revenue is only growing.” In fact, he said the company has “no plans of IPOing before 2028.”",techcrunch

https://tomshardware.com,XPG Prime tuning app dumps 50GB of anime girl photos in Redditor's temp folder,https://www.tomshardware.com/software/xpg-prime-tuning-app-dumps-50gb-of-anime-girl-photos-in-redditors-temp-folder,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 15:30:00 GMT","A Reddit user got a very unexpected surprise upon booting their PC: 50GB of anime girl pictures in their Windows temp folder, courtesy of XPG's Prime utility. This software was originally designed to customize and sync RGB lighting across compatible products. In our brief testing, we found that the software doesn't delete temporary UI wallpaper images and creates new redundant copies on every restart.

XPG is a gaming hardware and accessories product brand from Adata that specializes in RAM and SSDs, with a strong commitment to its anime styled aesthetics, which you'll find present on everything from their boxes to their apps. They've even gone as far as to create a mini anime series on their YouTube channel.

To determine the underlying cause, I installed XPG Prime on my system, which conveniently has a DDR5 memory kit from XPG's Lancer series. There's no standalone installer for XPG Prime, so I had to grab it from the Microsoft Store. On opening the app, it prompted me to create or use an existing XPG account, though there was an option to proceed as a guest as well.

You might wonder, why does an app that's built to control and synchronize RGB need to store such a vast-collection of anime pictures? Under its ""Wallpaper"" section, XPG Prime allows users to change their wallpaper from one of seventeen options. For those wondering, that massive 50GB chunk was just hundreds of copies of the same seventeen images, not unique ones.

I tried reopening the app several times while monitoring the size of my temp folder. Every time the app started, it generated a roughly 15MB copy of the same wallpapers. This might vary from user to user, but reaching 50GB at this rate would require over 3,000 attempts. It's possible the Redditor's temp folder had old, uncleared data, but it's hard to be certain.

The app serves a rather limited purpose and could easily be substituted for alternatives like OpenRGB, unless you desire something specific. Considering the 15MB of temporary data generated with each app startup, a user who turns on their PC three times a day throughout the year would accumulate a considerable 16.4GB of bloat. While not harmful, this is still an undesirable situation, and we hope XPG issues an update promptly, given that many consumers don't routinely clear their temp folders.",tomshardware

There are a few notable deals out there offering quality gaming and productivity boosting SSDs at a discounted rate. Today, we have come across an example of such an offer on the Sandisk 1TB Extreme SSD . This M.2 NVMe PCIe Gen4 drive usually goes for around $99, but right now it's available for just $59. It's important to note that this is for an internal M.2 SSD, not to be confused with the Sandisk Extreme Portable line.

The Sandisk 1TB Extreme SSD is definitely a quality drive, but we haven't had the opportunity to review this model for ourselves yet. Therefore, you won't find it in our best SSDs list. However, we still recommend perusing this list to see what drives are leading the market and to help you get a better understanding of how this drive stacks up against other similar SSDs on the market.

Sandisk 1TB Extreme SSD: now $59 at Amazon (was $99)

The Sandisk 1TB Extreme SSD is an M.2 drive capable of reaching read/write speeds as high as 5,150 / 4,900 MBps. It supports PCIe Gen 4.0 interfaces and comes with a 5-year warranty from Sandisk.

When it comes to choosing an SSD, speed is king. It's important to snag a drive capable of reaching high speeds to get some of the best performance possible. The Sandisk 1TB Extreme is far from the fastest on the market, but it definitely has plenty to offer, landing somewhere in the middle ground with read/write speeds around 5,150 / 4,900 MBps. It comes in an M.2 2280 form factor, which means it fits the most popular internal SSD form factor standard (22x 80mm), fitting inside most desktop and many laptop PCs with M.2 slots.

This offer is for the 1TB edition – that said, you can also purchase this drive in a 500GB model and a 2TB model. All the drives in this line have the same form factor and are compatible with NVMe PCIe Gen4 interfaces. The purchase is supported by both Amazon's 30-day return policy as well as a 5-year manufacturer's warranty from Sandisk that voids should the drive reach 600TBW.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,This Raspberry Pi Zero camera instantly prints photos using thermal paper,https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/this-raspberry-pi-zero-camera-instantly-prints-photos-using-thermal-paper,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:30:00 GMT","We're living in an age where digital photos reign supreme, but that hasn't stopped maker and developer Spacerower, as they are known as over at Reddit, from creating a Raspberry Pi -powered camera that creates physical photos for you on the spot. This handheld Pi camera was made from the ground up from scratch and features a Raspberry Pi Zero as the main board powering the operation.

According to Spacerower, the way it works is simple — although clearly the creation of the camera was far from it. To take a photo, just press the green button one time as a short press. If you can rotate it to adjust the brightness of the image, which is visible on a small LCD screen on the back of the camera. To print the photo, just long press the green button. It has a built-in thermal printer that not only prints the photo but also does so on sticker paper.

The housing for the hardware was created from scratch by Spacerower just for the project. This was done digitally so it could be 3D printed. The case was printed in PLA, but you could duplicate this process using any filament type and color of your choice. There is also a feature built into its design to protect the camera module lens that will cover the component. To activate it, you just have to rotate the black part of the camera surrounding the lens.

Like we mentioned before, the main board powering this camera is a Raspberry Pi Zero. It's connected to a Raspberry Pi camera module for capturing images. An Em5820 thermal printer is used to print the images, while an LCD screen with a resolution of 240 x 240px lets you preview them first. The unit also features a rotary encoder and a couple of 1200mAh batteries to keep the unit portable.

Unfortunately, we don't have a good look at the source code. However, the print files are available alongside a complete hardware list over at Printables. In the project thread description, Spacerower confirms that a custom Python script is used to capture the images with the picamera2 library and also manages the printing portion of the project using a library called python-escpos.

https://tomshardware.com,Linus Torvalds rages against ‘random turd files’ in Linux 6.15-rc1 directories,https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/linus-torvalds-rages-against-random-turd-files-in-linux-6-15-rc1-directories,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:58:52 GMT","Linus Torvalds is back at his explosively scatological best in some recent comments about a Linux 6.15-rc1 pull request (h/t Phoronix). The target of the Linux creator and lead developer’s ire was “the disgusting ‘hdrtest’ crap,” which he accused of slowing down software builds and leaving “random ‘hdrtest’ turds around.” Torvald’s full post concerning the hdrtest issue registered a six on the turd-o-meter.

While Torvalds was disturbed by the code that was impacting the latest Linux kernel, beginning his post with a “Grr,” he remained precise in his objections to it. “I did the pull, resolved the (trivial) conflicts, but I notice that this ended up containing the disgusting ‘hdrtest’ crap that (a) slows down the build because it's done for a regular allmodconfig build rather than be some simple thing that you guys can run as needed (b) also leaves random ‘hdrtest’ turds around in the include directories,” he wrote.

“This thing needs to *die*”

Torvalds went on to state that he had previously complained about this issue, and inquired why the hdr testing is being done as a regular part of the build. Moreover, he highlighted that the resulting ‘turds’ were breaking filename completion. Torvalds underlined this point - and his disgust - by stating, “this thing needs to *die*.”

In a shot of advice to fellow Linux developers, Toralds said, “If you want to do that hdrtest thing, do it as part of your *own* checks. Don't make everybody else see that disgusting thing and have those turds in their trees.” He then noted that he had decided to mark hdrtest as broken for now, to prevent its inclusion in regular builds.

So, what is ‘hdrtest’ and why has it brought Torvalds' frustration levels to boiling point? According to Phoronix, the Linux developer team has recently merged a large collection of open-source graphics card driver updates. Alongside this is ‘hdrtest’ code for the Intel Xe kernel driver, which includes code to test DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) header files.

To avoid any confusion, DRM in this instance isn’t Digital Rights Management it refers to the Direct Rendering Manager. On a similar note, hdrtest isn’t anything to do with High Dynamic Range (HDR) graphics, but is used by devs for verifying the integrity and self-containment of DRM h ea d e r files.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Leaked Asus ROG Crosshair X870E Extreme images suggest an imminent launch,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/motherboards/leaked-asus-rog-crosshair-x870e-extreme-images-suggest-an-imminent-launch,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:59:28 GMT","An Asus ROG Crosshair Extreme X870E motherboard is in the works, according to leaked photos shared by renowned leaker momomo_us. Though detailed specifications remain in the dark, we can spot several technical and cosmetic changes over the previous X670E class model. As a descendant of Asus' premier ROG Extreme family, you can expect a hefty price tag in the ballpark of $1,000 or higher.

Asus' overclocking-tailored X870E Apex motherboards, promising a minimum overclocking window of 8,200 MT/s memory speeds for Ryzen 9000 CPUs, are expected to hit shelves next month, on April 4. For a quick recap, Asus' ROG motherboards sub-brand is further segmented into the Crosshair and Maximus families. Under these two camps, we find even more designations like Extreme, Apex, Hero, Formula, and Gene. Across all chipsets, Asus reserves the Extreme designation for its highest-end and most premium offerings.

The X870E ROG Crosshair Extreme we're looking at today carries the E-ATX form-factor, covered in black and silver accents. There's a visible departure from the colorful anime-themed design of the previous model, though the premium finish more than deems the motherboard Extreme-worthy. Atop the I/O shroud sits what we believe is a customizable LCD, and the motherboard appears to use dual 8-pin EPS power connectors. Featuring four DIMM slots, the motherboard also includes a DIMM.2 slot for an M.2 expansion card.

Ensuring optimal cooling, the first M.2 slot beneath the CPU socket is covered by a heatsink that includes a heat pipe for heat dissipation. In terms of expansion, we can spot two PCIe x16 slots, likely to support Asus' updated Q-Release Slim GPU removal mechanism. Additional M.2 slots and the two Promontory 21 chipsets are housed within a large heatsink, adorned with Asus' ROG design.

On the right, you can find Asus' Q-Code LED for POST diagnostics alongside a ""START"" button and a ""FLEXKEY"" button. The FlexKey button is used as a system reset button by default, but its functionality can be customized for other use cases. There are also several right-angled ports to the right, including one for the large 24-pin ATX connector.

The back of the motherboard is covered in a protective and stylish backplate. Rear I/O options aren't as visible as we would've wanted, though we can certainly make out a handful of USB ports, a BIOS flashback port, an HDMI port, a 5GbE, a 10GbE, and Wi-Fi 7 antenna connections, among several others. Pricing and availability are unknown at the time of writing, but Asus might announce details shortly.",tomshardware
https://tomshardware.com,Crucial CUDIMM DDR5-6400 C52 2x16GB Review: Plug-and-Play Paradise for Arrow Lake,https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/crucial-cudimm-ddr5-6400-c52-2x16gb-review,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT","The Crucial CUDIMM DDR5-6400 memory kit is a great choice for users who want dependable, baseline performance but don't want to step foot inside their motherboards' BIOS settings.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

The Crucial CUDIMM DDR5-6400 memory kit may not appear exceptionally fast on paper, so it has much to prove against the best RAM. When you thought that DDR5 couldn't usher in any more innovations, JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) introduced CUDIMMs (Clocked Unbuffered Dual In-line Memory Modules) last year to shake things up. CUDIMMs are still DDR5 memory modules but incorporate an additional piece of hardware, a CKD (clock driver) chip that significantly improves signal stability at elevated frequencies.

The diminutive CKD integrated circuit (IC) assists vendors in pushing memory kits above the DDR5-8000 threshold. Although the CKD's primary benefit lies with ultra-fast memory kits, the chip also assists with products at the lower end of the speed spectrum. As per JEDEC's specification, DDR5-6400 serves as the baseline for CUDIMMs, so Crucial's CUDIMM memory kit strives to compete in that category.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The CUDIMMs look like your typical run-of-the-mill DDR5 memory modules. They lack fancy heat spreaders or flashy RGB lighting, which might appeal to some while deterring others. At least the PCB features a nice black color that seamlessly integrates with most PC builds, rather than the outdated green seen on earlier DDR5 memory modules. Since these are bare memory modules, they measure 1.23 inches (31.15mm) in height, so CPU cooler compatibility shouldn't be an issue.

The only things you'll find on the memory modules are Crucial's sticker featuring the company branding and basic specifications. The sticker peels off easily if you prefer to remove distractions from your hardware. The absence of a heat spreader allows you to see the CUDIMMs' components clearly, so there are no surprises under the hood. They are easily visible if you want to check the exact ICs that Crucial is using with the CUDIMMs.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The CUDIMMs have a single-sided design, meaning all the ICs are on one side. While we're on the topic, the ICs on these DDR5-6500 CUDIMMs carry the 4JD45 D8DKT markings, corresponding to Micron's D-die. Each memory module has a 16GB capacity with eight 2GB ICs onboard. The 0H=9J L4P power management IC (PMIC) comes from Richtek, while the D5CK01 CKD is from Montage Technology.

When installed on Intel's 800-series platform, the CUDIMMs automatically run at DDR5-6400 with 52-52-52-103 timings and a 1.1V DRAM voltage. No user intervention is necessary. The CUDIMMs do not possess any Intel XMP or AMD EXPO profiles; however, they have multiple fallback profiles when not paired with a CUDIMM-compatible platform. For example, on AMD's AM5 platform, the CUDIMMs revert to DDR5-5600 (official supported data rate for Ryzen 9000 CPUs) with 46-45-45-90 timings at 1.1V in bypass mode. As the name implies, bypass mode enables the CUDIMMs to operate as normal UDIMMs without the function of the CKD. See our PC Memory 101 feature and How to Shop for RAM story for more timings and frequency considerations.

Given the sloppy timings, it was not unexpected that Crucial's CUDIMMs exhibited slower performance relative to the competition. The results indicated that it ranked last in application-based and gaming performance. Nevertheless, the memory kit demonstrated notable dominance in specific workloads, specifically in Adobe Photoshop, 7-Zip decompression, and HandBrake X265 conversion, where it outperformed the other overclocked memory kits.

AMD Performance

The memory kit's standing on the AMD platform remained unchanged. The CUDIMMs did not exhibit notable highlights on this particular platform, as they typically ranked at the bottom of the barrel regarding application and gaming benchmarks.

Overclocking and Latency Tuning

By default, the CUDIMMs operate according to JEDEC's 1.1V for DDR5. The PMIC accommodates voltages of up to 1.435V, providing significant voltage headroom. Nevertheless, we could not overclock the CUDIMMs beyond DDR5-6400, even when utilizing the maximum DRAM voltage or implementing very relaxed timings. It's plausible that our sample didn't have any overclocking headroom or that the motherboards may not be optimized for Micron ICs.

We encountered similar obstacles while attempting to reduce the memory timings of the CUDIMMs. It is noteworthy that Micron's ICs are not typically recognized for their tight timings; however, the CUDIMMs did not budge. Again, it could be our bad luck with the silicon lottery.

Bottom Line

The Crucial CUDIMM DDR5-6400 C52 memory kit's JEDEC-rated timings are daunting enough to deter potential buyers. This is understandable since more speedy DDR5-6400 memory kits are on the market with better timings. Crucial's CUDIMM memory kit specifically appeals to Core Ultra 200S processor owners who are content with baseline performance and wish to avoid messing around inside their motherboards' settings. Intel's latest 800-series platform is presently the only one that has fully adopted CUDIMMs, so AMD users should steer clear. While CUDIMMs can function on AMD platforms, their functionality is limited since you lose the CKD's function; thus, spending extra on a feature you can't fully utilize doesn't make much sense for AMD users right now.

DDR5 is more expensive than DDR4 for several reasons, but a primary factor is the need for more components. CUDIMMs continue contributing to this issue, now incorporating the additional CKD IC. The Crucial CUDIMM DDR5-6400 C52 is priced at $169.99, significantly higher than competitors that offer considerably better timings and, consequently, higher performance. Does the premium price tag make it a poor memory kit? Not really. Remember that the Crucial CUDIMM DDR5-6400 C52 competes in a niche market.",tomshardware
https://zdnet.com,Labeling AI-created content becomes essential in China -- Xiaomi's Leigun also struggles with AI fraud,https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35231133/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","今、中国で最も人気のあるIT系企業の経営者といえば、最近再び脚光を浴びている阿里巴巴（アリババ）の馬雲（ジャック・マー）氏でも、同社との二強時代から一強になりトップに躍り出た騰訊（テンセント）の馬化騰（ポニー・マー）氏でもなく、小米科技（シャオミ）の雷軍（レイ・ジュン）氏だ。

シャオミは日本で直営店のオープンや新しいスマートフォンの発売で話題になっている。一方、中国では電気自動車（EV）の魅力的な製品とサービスで注目を集めている。シャオミの創業者であるレイ氏は、モーターショーでインフルエンサーとしてブースに登場し、SNSで動画を配信した。その結果、同氏を見ようと多くの人がシャオミのブースに集まった。

そんなレイ氏は企業の広告塔として、「微信」（WeChat）向けの動くスタンプをリリースし、多くのネットユーザーから人気を集めている。一方で、レイ氏の許可なく、ネットユーザーが多数の音声ソースを使って同氏が口汚く罵る音声をAIツールで作り出し、それをまとめたボイスパックが拡散した。知名度が高いため、あっという間に多くの人がその音声を耳にするようになり、レイ氏は「そういうことはやめてほしい」と動画で訴えかけた。

3月5日に「全国人民代表大会」（全人代）が開幕した。レイ氏も代表の1人として参加し、そこでAIによる個人の顔や声の改ざん対策について3つの提案をした。同氏は特に目立った被害者だが、各種AIツールの登場により、有名人かどうかに関わらず、ニュースで報道されるケースが増えているため、対策を提案したのだろう。

1つ目は、AIに関する独立した法律の導入を検討することだ。適用の境界線を明確にし、権利侵害の証拠に関する規則を変更し、刑事罰を強化する。2つ目は、プラットフォームなどの責任を強化することだ。プラットフォーム企業がAIによって生成、合成されたコンテンツを正確に識別し、検査や審査、苦情や報告、緊急対応のメカニズムを構築し、問題のあるコンテンツの拡散を適時に阻止する技術能力の開発を支援する。3つ目は、ネットユーザーへの啓発を強化することだ。小学校から高校までの教科書にAIに関する倫理的な内容を追加し、家庭でも啓発活動を行う。法整備、プラットフォームの協力、市民への啓発活動の3つの方法は、中国でよく見られるやり方だ。

その後、14日に「人工智能生成合成内容標識方法」が発表され、AIで生成されたファイルにラベルを付けることが義務付けられた。この規則は、情報産業省に当たる工業和信息化部、公安部、国家ラジオテレビ総局などが共同で発表し、9月1日から施行される。この規則では、AIで作られたコンテンツには、誰でも見えるラベルと、見えないラベルを付ける必要がある。プラットフォームは、これらのラベルが付いたコンテンツを適切に扱わなければならない。

サービス提供者は、AIが作ったテキスト、音声、画像、動画、仮想空間などのコンテンツに、AIで生成されたことを示すラベルを付ける必要がある。具体的には、次のようになる。

テキスト：文頭、文末、文中に文字や記号で表示

音声：冒頭、末尾、途中に音声やリズムで通知

画像：目立つ位置にウォーターマークを付与

動画：冒頭、再生中の画面周辺、または途中にラベルを表示

仮想空間：開始画面やサービス提供中にラベルを表示

さらに、ダウンロードやコピーを提供する際にも、これらのラベルがファイルに適切に埋め込まれていることを確認する必要がある。

見えるラベルに加えて、メタデータやデジタル透かしといった見えないラベルも必要だ。AIサービス提供者は、生成されたコンテンツのメタデータにコンテンツの属性や提供者名などの識別情報を埋め込むことが義務付けられる。配信プラットフォームは、メタデータにラベルがあればそれを確認して明示し、ラベルがないものの投稿者が生成コンテンツであると自己申告した場合には、その情報に基づいてラベルを付与する。また、ラベルがないにもかかわらずAI生成の痕跡が認められる場合も、目立つ形で明示的なラベルを追加しなければならない。さらに、ラベルの改ざんや不正操作を目的としたツールやサービスの提供、および他社の権利を侵害する不適切なラベルの使用も禁じられている。

これにより、AIによるコンテンツ生成が引き起こす犯罪が完全になくなるわけではない。例えば、生成AIを使って歴史上の人物を架空の状況で戦わせるなど、歴史を改ざん、悪用する動画を作ることを禁止する「生成式人工智能服務管理暫行方法」によって、中国のネット空間ではそうした動画をほとんど見かけなくなった。ラベル付けが義務化されれば、AIによるコラージュコンテンツはかなり減るだろう。一方で、海外でAIによって作られたコンテンツにはラベルがないため、今後の動向を注視する必要がある。",zdnet

Will you go home as is? --The interpretation from leading companies",https://japan.zdnet.com/article/35230968/,"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","With the growing labor shortage and the spread of cashless payments, unmanned/manned stores are expanding. In this article, we will explain the mechanisms, benefits, and challenges of various unmanned stores, while experiencing the unmanned store systems developed by TOUCH TO GO (TTG) and NTT Data.

Unmanned stores can be broadly divided into ""self-checkout"" types, where customers scan and pay for products without the need for store staff; ""walkthrough types"" types, where customers automatically make payments when they pick up the product and leave the store; and ""vending machine types"", which allow you to operate around the clock without staff. The common benefits are stable store management with no-managers/small people and improved convenience for customers.

The core elements of realizing self-checkout/walkthrough stores are the AI ​​camera on the ceiling and the weight sensor on the product shelf. In many cases, the AI ​​camera on the ceiling captures the movement of customers, and the weight sensor on the shelf that it picks up, linking two types of data to recognize ""who took what"" in real time.

Self-checkout store where you can shop by passing by

TTG, which operates an unmanned payment store system, has steadily increased the number of stores introduced in 2020, starting with the opening of TOUCH TO GO Takanawa Gateway Station Store (Minato-ku, Tokyo), and is a leading figure in the spread of self-checkout stores. FamilyMart utilizes its unmanned payment store system, and as of September 2024, it has 44 unmanned payment convenience stores nationwide.

Stores that have introduced TTG's unmanned payment store system, which is characterized by the fact that visitors do not need to prepare to register as a member when they enter the store, allowing them to enter and pay by passing by. The AI ​​camera and weight sensors can recognize who took what, so there is no need to scan the product barcode at checkout. When a customer stands in front of the register, the product details and total amount are displayed on the display screen.

Since many self-checkout stores allow you to enter the store on your way by passing by, it is believed to go well with stores such as stations where you often stop by. In fact, TTG's unmanned payment store system is used at unmanned stores selling souvenirs on the Tokaido Shinkansen platforms 16 and 17, as well as at take-out stores for Mister Donuts at the commercial facility Atre Shinanomachi. Although there is still an accounting process, it can be said that the reality is that it is aimed at unmanned/maintenance in stores due to the convenience and convenience of purchasing.",zdnet
