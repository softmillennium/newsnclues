US president Donald Trump

Donald Trump has hit out at Russian President Vladimir Putin for comments he made about the leader of Ukraine.

The US president was speaking after Russian drones hit a military hospital, shopping centre and apartment blocks in Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv, killing two people and wounding dozens.

In an interview with NBC News, he referenced comments Putin made on Friday about temporarily putting Ukraine under external governance.

Trump said he was “angry, pissed off” when the Russian leader “started getting into Zelensky’s credibility”.

Putin reaffirmed his claim that Volodymyr Zelensky, whose presidential term expired last year, lacks the legitimacy to sign a peace deal. Under Ukraine’s constitution it is illegal for the country to hold national elections while it is under martial law.

“If a deal isn’t made, and if I think it was Russia’s fault, I’m going to put secondary sanctions on Russia,” Trump said, adding that there would be “a 25 to 50-point tariff on all oil”.

“Anybody buying oil from Russia will not be able to sell their product, any product, not just oil, into the United States.”

Nonetheless, he reiterated that he and Putin have a “very good relationship”.

Ukraine’s General Staff had earlier denounced the “deliberate, targeted shelling” of the military hospital late on Saturday. Among the casualties were service members who were undergoing treatment, it said.

Regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said those killed were a 67-year-old man and a 70-year-old woman.

Ukraine’s air force reported that Russia fired 111 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks overnight into Sunday. It said 65 were intercepted and another 35 were lost, having probably been electronically jammed.

Zelensky said on Sunday that over the past week “most regions of Ukraine” had come under Russian attack.

Writing on X, he said “1,310 Russian guided aerial bombs, over 1,000 attack drones — mostly ‘Shaheds’ — and nine missiles of various types, including ballistic ones” had been launched against Ukraine.

He repeated his assertion that “Russia is dragging out the war”, echoing comments he made on Thursday that Russia is prolonging ceasefire talks “just to buy time and then try to grab more land”.

Russia’s Ministry of Defence said its air defence systems had shot down six Ukrainian drones, and that its troops had taken control of a village in Ukraine’s partly occupied Donetsk region.

According to Ukrainian government and military analysts, Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in the coming weeks to maximise pressure on Kyiv and strengthen the Kremlin’s negotiating position in ceasefire talks.

https://cityam.com,Adolescence star Erin Doherty on queer storytelling and The Crown,https://www.cityam.com/erin-doherty-on-surviving-adolescence-queer-storytelling-and-why-she-hates-her-phone/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 10:16:24 GMT","Adolescence star Erin Doherty on her LGBTQ identity and bingeing The Crown

Erin Doherty talks to City AM The Magazine about surviving Adolescence, shrinking away from fame and why she hates her phone

Erin Doherty rose to fame as the young Princess Anne in The Crown, but this year has found new success working alongside Stephen Graham on two projects, A Thousand Blows and Adolescence. She tells Adam Bloodworth how playing a child psychologist in the latter ‘consumed’ her, the type of queer stories she’d like to tell over the coming years and how she’s been bingeing The Crown long after she left the Netflix show

Erin Doherty had already captured the zeitgeist. Her performance as Princess Anne in The Crown had such subtle power that it made casting director Nina Gold realise working class people could play aristocrats. Then as crime lord Mary Carr in A Thousand Blows, she was lauded as one of the most versatile actors of her generation. Next came Adolescence, in which Doherty plays a child psychologist interviewing a teenager accused of murder, which blew everything else out of the water.

Doherty leads some of the most harrowing scenes in the mini series, which has garnered the biggest audience for any streaming TV show in the UK in a single week. It’s become hard to pop to the shops without people asking “have you seen Adolescence?” – and everyone sounds genuinely unnerved. Asking questions about masculinity and online culture, it follows a 13-year-old boy, Jamie, who’s been accused of murder. Shot as live, each episode is filmed in a single take, with actors allowed to improvise, making its form almost as interesting as its content. Owen Cooper, who plays Jamie, has already landed the role of young Heathcliff in a forthcoming film adaptation of Wuthering Heights.

Doherty says she was genuinely scared during filming. You can’t turn away from her interrogation, which controversially humanises a murder suspect, but also shows the mental health repercussions on the psychologist.

Erin Doherty: filming Adolescence exhausted me, but it was worth it

We start by acknowledging that, by anyone’s standards, it’s been quite the year. “It took a good month to get it out of my system,” says Doherty of Adolescence. “You can’t escape what it’s doing to you, it kind of gets in your bones. There’s no copy and paste formula like, ‘Okay, I’ll do this, and then I’ll be Erin again.’ I was just so consumed and exhausted, just at the level of emotional intensity of this thing.’” Doherty is propelled by the show’s themes about online radicalisation of young men. “I think we all have to hold ourselves accountable for trying to break the cycle in some way.”

Talking over Zoom, Doherty wears a luminescent blue jumper and an even brighter smile. Unlike her most famous roles which veer towards austere, she is cheery and incredibly gracious. The first thing she offers is motherly reassurance about the tech issues I’ve had logging onto our call. “It’s so stressful, but you don’t need that anymore – it’s all gone!” She chats effusively about everything from how she hated school to bingeing The Crown and obsessing over her characters. If a PE teacher were to mark her interview style, they’d commend her for “giving 110 per cent.”

Had it not been for Adolescence, her boxing drama A Thousand Blows, released this February on Disney Plus, would still be brewing in the public consciousness. Doherty’s female crime lord was gently terrifying, with some hilarious lines, and that’s without mentioning the game-changing representation: bad-ass Victorian female crime lords, based on women who actually existed, aren’t your classic prime-time fodder. She spent a year filming that, then went straight into Adolescence, both with Stephen Graham, who invited her into the latter after being impressed by her work on the former: “I didn’t even read the script,” she says. “Whatever he does is just full of pure heart and love and care. I just knew that it was gonna be so vital; he doesn’t take on projects lightly.”

Netflix: Adolescence breaks the record to get the biggest viewership of any mini-series on the platform

The show has become the first streaming show ever to top the UK’s weekly TV ratings. “With something that is so frightening, it’s so easy to avoid it and to just go, ‘What a horrible thing that some people can do, I can’t get my head around it.’ Whereas this show is going, I understand how frightening a prospect that is, but we have to hold ourselves accountable for shining a light and going, ‘How are these events happening?’” says Doherty.

“Especially with our younger generation, we deserve to humanise how they get there, because otherwise, again, they just become this kind of two dimensional evil ‘other’. And actually, I do believe that everyone is born a good person. I don’t think that people are inherently evil. So it’s always necessary, it’s always worthy of our time to pick at that and go, ‘Oh my God, how did you get there?’”

Chuck in eight West End eight shows a week on top of her promotional schedule for Adolescence (she’s currently starring in the play Unicorn) and despite how she clearly loves talking about the show, she admits she’s “sooooo readyyyyyy” for a holiday. I suspect her ability to appear affable even when she’s exhausted has helped her schmooze numerous big-wigs on her way up.

You wonder how our brightest Hollywood hope would fare on a sun lounger. Doherty admits she obsesses over people to a degree that isn’t healthy. “It’s my biggest thing that I battle with,” she says. “I think we’ve all got demons. For me, it manifests as overthinking. I’ll get to the end of the day and I’ll lie in bed and be like, ‘Oh God, I hope that person didn’t take that the wrong way.’” She has to be careful that this approach doesn’t wear her down, because she “grew up a people pleaser.” But her ability to over-analyse can yield positive results, working in favour of forthcoming projects. When she researches roles, “I’ll dig and dig and dig and really try to understand and pick up why people behave the way they behave. I could linger on a specific interaction for a week.”

I don’t need to know what you think about my work. If you want to come up to me and talk about it, great, but I don’t need to be a part of that conversation online

Growing up in Crawley, West Sussex, as a young girl Doherty and her older sister would take acting classes at the weekends. She was the shy one, but nevertheless remembers the experience changing her. “Something flipped through art,” she says. “I was like, ‘Oh, I don’t have to be Erin anymore.’ That was my first lasting impression of what acting and being someone else could do, mentally. I can put that anxiety down for a couple of hours and just let go. There’s not been anything else that I’ve found so freeing. It’s just in me. I don’t know how I would function without this ability to just let go.”

She took a one-year course at the Guildford School of Acting in 2011, not long after leaving high school. Studying acting at the Bristol Old Vic, she graduated in 2015 and was first inspired to tread the boards after watching Mike Bartlett’s Earthquakes in London at the National Theatre, a vivid, chaotic interpretative dance number about, amongst other things, climate change.

Call The Midwife and the BBC miniseries of Les Misérables were early roles, but the part that properly propelled her came in 2019 when she was cast as a young Princess Anne in The Crown. Casting director Nina Gold had thought “playing a whole different social class is one of the most difficult things to do convincingly”, but has admitted, “Erin really blew that theory.” She was captivating as the poised young princess, revealing a vividness to the most reluctantly camera-ready of the late Queen’s children. She still binges The Crown, and is obsessed with Imelda Staunton. “I got to meet her the other day. We were working on an audio book, and she is everything you want her to be. I absolutely binged the last series and thought it was phenomenal.”

Looking back to where it all began, Doherty reminisces about studying musical theatre at her comprehensive school in Crawley. She still has family there, and pops back regularly, but as a whole she cannot wax lyrical about the institution. “I hated school with a passion,” she says. “But the drama department was so pivotal to me.” She’d love to go back and jump in on some lessons. “I have such admiration for teachers but I could never see myself having the skill and ability.”

Erin Doherty on working with Stephen Graham

If not through teaching, she has always been keen to promote the idea of levelling up. Doherty seems genuinely overwhelmed when I read the Nina Gold quote to her. “For her to say something like that, I don’t really know how to deal with that. I’m just grateful she took a chance, and I hope that it encourages other casting directors to keep doing that, because I think without them taking that leap of faith, so many actors wouldn’t get their foot in the door. I think that an actor’s job is to transform.” She’s passionate about “bringing working class actors into the world of screen acting,” and has been inspired by Stephen Graham. “He’s so brilliant at climbing the ladder, looking down and helping people up. That’s so inspiring to me. If I could do what he did for me and is continuing to do for others, I’d be so overjoyed.”

Away from work, Doherty is private, but decompresses by enjoying the small things. “Walks, family, engaging in normal conversation.” You sense she finds the concept of celebrity so bizarre that describing her downtime is a weird notion in itself. Despite whatever’s been written about her (none of which she reads), success has forced her “to really, really lean into my people. I have a very small circle.” She is happily in a relationship, but contrary to newspaper headlines, her girlfriend “isn’t in the industry”.

You can see why Adolescence appealed. She admits she is “awful” at her phone, always leaving her family on read, and says too many of us are addicted to technology. “I don’t think I’m doing it right either,” she says of her scarce digital approach. “I feel like there’s got to be a better balance. I’ve just kind of gone the opposite end of the scale.” Of Gen Z, who are growing up internet natives, she has “such empathy.” “It just completely freaks me out. I don’t know how I’d manage.”

She shies away from public perceptions about her, and is firm about why: “I just want people to watch the show. I don’t necessarily need to know what you think about it. If you want to come up to me and we’ll talk about it, great, but I don’t need to be a part of that conversation online. That’s not for me.” Instead, her family and set of lifelong friends are her barometer. “They’ll be like, ‘Things are really positive for you. Just know that you’re doing alright.’ I don’t need to look any further. If my people are telling me that it’s all good, then that’s enough.”

Queer representation

As for what’s next, she’s vague, but implies nothing’s firmly on the table yet. She will reveal, though, that more queer storytelling is a priority. “I feel like that’s going to be the route that I go down. Because, as I say, I’m so deeply passionate about telling queer stories and providing that representation. I hope that’s something I’ll get to pursue down the line. Breaking the kind of mould of it being a trope or like a cliche, being the queer friend, or the exploration of the relationships. They do exist, but it’s really rare to find the nuance and the levels of detail of what it means to be queer.” She’s inspired by “the way Steven collaborated with Jack Thorne on Adolescence. I’d love to maybe collaborate with a writer because I don’t know if I’ve got the bravery to be like, ‘And now I’m going to write this thing.’ I hold my hand up, I am definitely an actor.”

She circles back to that much needed holiday, then, on the topic of future roles, offers me a final one of her beautiful thought spirals. “I just like people,” she says. “Trying to figure out why we behave the way we behave, whether that means putting on a corset and walking down the cobbles of East End London or putting on an Adidas tracksuit and exploring what that means in 2025.”

Could fintech IPOs be the boost the London Stock Exchange needs?

London markets have suffered a torrid couple of years, but could fintech help turn the tide?

Swedish fintech Klarna marked the latest snub to the City after it announced it was pursuing a US-listing despite hopes the firm would float in London.

This followed 88 companies leaving the London Stock Exchange (LSE) last year, including tech darling Darktrace which jumped ship after it was acquired by US private equity Thoma Bravo in April 2024.

But hope is not lost.

Numerous young fintechs are waiting in the wings and a listing from any would provide a major boost to London and its status as a fintech hub.

Z/Yen’s 37th Global Finance Centre’s Index showed London was on the cusp of taking New York’s fintech crown, and a flurry of fintech listings may not only take the Square Mile to the top of global fintech, but also re-energise the embattled LSE.

Monzo

The digital challenger bank is a staple in UK fintech and would rank among the top choices across all industries for a listing.

Monzo increased its valuation to £4.5bn in October 2024 following a secondary share sale and boasts over 10m customers.

In June 2024, the fintech’s chief executive TS Anil told City AM he wished to grow the business “several times” larger before an IPO.

Anil is said to be at odds with the company’s boards over where to list, with the boss eyeing the US and the board keen to stay in the City.

Speculation of a listing mounted after the neobank appointed Tom Oldham, a former Nubank executive, as its chief financial Officer in November.

Monzo touted Oldham’s role “during a transformative period of hypergrowth and Nubank’s IPO,” which took place in New York in December 2021.

Starling

The fintech unicorn boasts gross lending over £2bn and deposits north of £5.4bn making it one of the most hotly awaited IPOs in the UK.

In 2022, Starling had its first full year of profitability after posting pre-tax profit of £32.1m.

The digital bank increased signs it was gearing up for an IPO after it began recruiting for a London-based role to work with senior management to “execute a successful IPO or other capital event”.

The job description also said it would “support the business in its steps towards its consideration of IPO readiness”.

John Mountain, the fintech’s interim chief executive, discussed a potential flotation and said whilst a location had not been confirmed, London would be a “natural home”.

Zilch

The UK-based buy now, pay later firm is expected to go public in the next 12 to 24 months after securing £100m in debt financing from Deutsche Bank.

Zilch was also seen to be gearing up for a flotation after it announced plans to double its headcount over the next 18 months.

Speaking at an Innovate Finance summit in October 2024, the fintech’s chief executive Philip Belamant said: “We’re a British business. We’re born here, the headquarters is here, we’re going to be doubling the size of the staff – we’re hiring more than 400 people over the next year and a half here in the UK – and our customer base today is here.

“So we think wouldn’t it be fantastic for businesses to list here. We think that is the right thing.”

The London-based business became the fastest fintech company in Europe to obtain double unicorn status since Series A funding in November 2021.

Belamant is a co-chair of Innovate Finance’s “Unicorn Council,” which took part in a meeting with the Chancellor and fintech executives earlier this month to discuss ways to boost economic growth.

ClearScore

Counter to the bosses of rival firms, Justin Basini, the chief executive of ClearScore, has gushed over a potential London listing.

Basini told The Times the London Stock Exchange marked a “natural destination” for an IPO ahead of the company considering its options.

The fintech boss also praised the “vibrant” fintech sector in the City.

Whilst he didn’t ignore the City’s challenges, addressing the lack of “homegrown growth equity” compared to US public markets, he said UK investors were beginning to “wrap their heads around the opportunities to invest behind growth”.

The firm has operations across the UK, South Africa, Canada and Australia, with over 19 million users worldwide.

The fintech has long been tipped a ‘soonicorn,’ with it standing on the verge of a £1bn valuation.

Zopa

Digital bank Zopa cemented its unicorn status after fundraising £80m, which included money from an arm of the AP Moller conglomerate.

The London-based lender, which launched as a fully licensed bank in 2020, announced late last year it was on the hunt for new acquisitions as it looked to compete with the likes of Monzo and Starling.

Jaidev Janardana told City AM in December 2024 there was “no timeline” on an IPO and it was not a “top priority”.

Whilst floating does not appear to be an imminent priority, Zopa is among the firms that have been courted by the London Stock Exchange and Treasury officials to choose London as its listing venue.

The firm struck a deal with John Lewis in October to provide personal loans of up to £35,000 directly to the retailers 23 million customers.

Any leaning towards London for a flotation would mark a major boost for the City, though the fintech remains tight-lipped over future endeavours for now.",cityam
https://cityam.com,Businesses face billions of extra costs as wages and tax to rise,https://www.cityam.com/businesses-face-billions-of-extra-costs-as-wages-and-tax-to-rise/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 09:19:38 GMT","Businesses face billions of extra costs as wages and tax to rise

Retail and hospitality bosses have warned that higher labour costs and taxes are set to push up prices for customers across the UK.

UK businesses are set to face a multibillion-pound wave of higher costs this week as higher wages and tax increases come into force.

Retail and hospitality bosses have warned that higher labour costs and taxes are set to push up prices for customers across the UK.

A raft of measures linked to the Labour government’s first budget will come into force on 1 April, including a rise in the national minimum wage and higher property tax payments.

This will be followed by changes to national insurance contribution (NICs) payments from 6 April.

Millions of UK workers will benefit from a rise in the national minimum wage to £12.21 an hour on Tuesday, representing an increase of 77p.

The move has forced many of the UK’s largest employers to increase their rates of pay, with supermarket groups Tesco and Sainsbury’s among firms to announce they would hike their basic pay above the new minimum.

The rise in wages will come into force at the same time as businesses swallow a raft of tax changes, many of which they had not expected prior to the autumn budget.

One of the most significant of these will be an increase in business rates for many high street firms due to a reduction in current discounts for more than 250,000 retail, hospitality and leisure firms.

These businesses currently receive a 60 per cent discount on their business rates – the property tax on commercial businesses – bills up to a cap of £110,000.

However, this discount will be reduced to 25 per cent from 1 April.

The drop in the discount means that the average small shop will now see its business rates spiral from £3,589 to £8,613, according to analysis from global tax firm Ryan.

Its research also showed that the overall business rates bill for firms in England will rise by £1.5bn for the year as a result of the change.

Pub, retail and leisure bosses have called for an overhaul of the business rates regime in the Government’s next budget.

Alex Probyn, practice leader of property tax at Ryan, said the rises “will disproportionately affect small and independent businesses across sectors already struggling, whilst medium to large-sized businesses across all sectors of the economy tell us the standard rate of tax is now a disincentive to invest and is anti-growth.”

From Tuesday, supermarkets, food producers and online retailers will also be hit by a new plastic packaging tax.

Retailers will be liable to pay a charge, based on weight, for every item of packaging they use in the products that they sell.

The Food and Drink Federation has warned that the tax, which could raise up to £2bn, is likely to lead to higher prices for consumers.

Businesses will face further pressure from higher taxes from 6 April, when changes to NICs come into force.

In October, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that the rate of employer NICs will increase from 13.8 per cent to 15 per cent in April.

At the same time, firms will also pay more because the government lowered the threshold at which companies would start paying NICs from £9,100 to £5,000.

Changes to NICs are expected to allow the government to raise a further £25bn each year.

Rachel Reeves has used different growth indicators in her first year as Chancellor. (Photo by Stefan Rousseau-WPA Pool/Getty Images)

Wobbly growth is the opposite of what Rachel Reeves would have hoped for in her first six months as Chancellor.

While the headline figure on Friday morning said the UK economy had only expanded by 0.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2024, economists suggested that there was a more pressing matter at hand.

The Office for National Statistics showed that GDP per head had dropped since Labour took office in July: down 0.3 per cent in the third quarter and a further 0.1 per cent in the last quarter.

The hits to GDP per capita have been constant. There was a rise in GDP per capita in just four of the last 12 quarters.

In February this year, Panmure Liberum economist Simon French published a chart on X showing UK GDP per capita figures lagging behind a G7 average.

“There will be little electoral credit for growth until this inflects higher,” he said.

Speaking to City AM, French said recently published figures should not be taken as an indictment of Reeves’ fiscal policy choices made so far.

But he did say the metric will be essential to final judgements on whether the Chancellor by the next election.

“In terms of quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year [GDP per capita figures], particularly less than a year into the new government, attributing anything to Labour is a bit unfair,” he said.

“But by the end of the parliament, when you’ve had your time to change the parameters regarding population growth, regarding capital investment, you should be starting to see that come through in the GDP per capita numbers.”

As French and other economists point out, the metric is seen as an important indicator for how Brits fare against their G7 friends and families in Germany, America and Canada (the answer is worse).

“I think GDP per capita is probably the best measure that you would look at internationally to compare the size of economy over time and how it’s evolving in different countries,” said Sandra Horsfield, an economist at Investec.

“I think if [you’re measuring] how well is the economy performing, how much growth is the economy generating in its own right, then GDP per capita is the right measure,” she added.

The Chancellor is coming under pressure to make Brits richer in the short term.

And so, in the middle of her Spring Statement, she drifted away from GDP and highlighted one key OBR estimate as essential to her mission in delivering growth.

“The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) say today that people will be on average over £500 a year better off under this Labour government,” the resolute Chancellor told Parliament.

What she appeared to be pointing to was a paragraph in page 36 of the OBR’s economic and fiscal outlook report.

The report said: “We expect real household disposable income (RHDI) per person to grow at an average of around half a per cent a year in the five years from 2025-26 to 2029-30.”

It continued: “Growth [in RHDI) is projected to vary significantly around this average, first slowing sharply from 2.5 per cent in 2024-25 to almost no growth in 2027-28.”

Her reliance on RHDI has come under intense scrutiny since the Spring Statement.

The left-leaning think tank Resolution Foundation made an independent analysis of data put out by the OBR and published figures that come into direct conflict with her Reeves’ statement.

“The combination of a weak economic outlook and benefit cuts that fall disproportionately on lower-income families means that living standards are on track to fall over the next five years for the poorest half of households by £500 on average,” it said.

Reeves has remained defiant.

In response to data released by the ONS, which revealed that RHDI had increased by 1.7 per cent in the fourth quarter and 0.6 per cent in the month before, the Chancellor said “living standards are growing at their fastest rate in two years”.

“Getting more money in working people’s pockets is my number one mission,” she said.

The caveat was that the statistics body claimed this increase was mostly used to increase savings, stumping growth in GDP terms which only came out at 0.1 per cent higher in the final quarter.

This is where the clashes between data begin to deepen as Reeves appears to be enjoying a pick-and-choose approach to measuring growth.

But it is firstly an economist’s problem.

“The issue at the moment is: how do you measure income?” Horsfield reflected.

“If we come to the numbers that we have at the moment it would seem to indicate that incomes are growing because employment is growing more sharply than seems to be the way some other key indicators have at this time.”

The conundrum around growth measurements is spilling over into a heated political debate.

Reform UK’s Deputy Leader Richard Tice believes GDP, the most frequently-used growth indicator, is “not reflective of the position that ordinary people in Britain find themselves in” given high immigration “artificially inflates our economy”.

“By measuring GDP per head we can get a clearer picture of how this government is performing. When looking at these figures, it’s clear that people are getting poorer, no thanks Labour’s anti-growth and anti-business agenda, with GDP per capita falling consistently for the last two years,” he told City AM.

Tice echoes former Tory leadership candidate James Cleverly, who said during his campaign last year that GDP should only be reported per capita so the Treasury could not “mask low growth with high migration”.

Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride, meanwhile, pointed out in comments provided to City AM that figures released on Friday morning showing that GDP per head had fallen again meant Brits were “getting poorer”.

“The Chancellor and Prime Minister continue to tell us we’ll be better off – they are totally out of touch with reality,” he said.

Stride’s comments raise fundamental questions about how the Chancellor wants to measure her success and what “growth” ultimately means for the UK.

This comes into sharper focus when one considers how Treasury minister Torsten Bell frequently highlighted the importance of GDP per capita while working at the Resolution Foundation before last year’s election

GDP per capita is” what ultimately matters for our living standards”, he said in one tweet a year ago.

Growth indicators will always be the subject of great debate among economists and analysts. It depends on perspectives and the relevance of different measures change according to specific situations.

But by jumping between indicators to measure her achievements, the Chancellor risks confusing economists – as well as the British electorate.",cityam
https://cityam.com,Why are we all saving so much?,https://www.cityam.com/why-are-we-all-saving-so-much/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 05:00:00 GMT","Why are we all saving so much?

Saving rates among UK households are at their highest since the pandemic

It’s a question that has been puzzling economists for months.

The worst of the cost-of-living crisis is, for most households, moving further into their rear-view mirror.

The Bank of England’s rate setters have successfully – if belatedly – reined in the worst of the inflation that caused so many households to tighten their belts after the gas price shock of 2022.

The Bank Rate – having shot up over five per between the start of 2022 and half-way through 2023 – has begun to drift downward. Some storied financial institutions like Panmure Liberum and and Goldman Sachs are even pricing in as many as six interest rate cuts over the course of this year.

In other words, monetary conditions are loosening. Disposable incomes are rising, albeit slowly. And with that – and despite the best efforts of our moribund economy – people should be feeling better off, loosening the hatches that they’d firmly battened down over the preceding three years.

But that hasn’t been the case. In fact, savings rates are the highest they have been since the height of the pandemic.

Figures released by the Office for National Statistics on Friday morning found that the saving ratio – the amount of disposable income that people choose to save – had risen to 12 per cent in the fourth quarter. This is up from 10.3 per cent in the previous three months and 8.3 per cent this time last year.

In other words, despite macroeconomic conditions suggesting people might be minded to loosening the purse strings, excluding the pandemic we – as a nation – are squirrelling more money away than since the aftermath of the financial crash.

Saving for what’s to come…

And households’ collective caution is – economists say – weighing on the economy. More money being siphoned off into bank accounts – while healthy for people’s financial resilience – spells less spending, less economic activity and – by extension – less economic growth.

“Although household incomes are growing strongly, and outpaced inflation in 2024, consumers have proven reluctant to loosen their purse strings,” Jessica Hinds, a director in Fitch Ratings’ economics team, tells City AM.

Hinds believes consumers are worried about a potential downturn in their economic fortunes. Reports of firms cutting jobs in response to bare down on rising costs could be weighing on people’s minds – particularly those in lower- to middle-income households. This combined with the spectre of rising energy bills, water bills and post-national insurance price hike jitters, have all contributed, she says, to consumers’ reticence to let loose.

That notwithstanding, Fitch does anticipate consumer spending only picking up marginally across the year, to 0.9 per cent, from 0.7 per cent in 2024.

Saving for what’s already happened

Others – like ING’s chief UK economist James Smith – believe it’s more to do with what has passed. Smith believes many in the country are currently re-feathering their nests, after many people’s reserves were depleted during the cost of living crisis.

“One theory here is that this [the higher savings ratio] is ‘consumption smoothing’,” he tells City AM. “Households were hit with the gas price shock of 2022, and they’re compensating for it now with higher savings rates now real wage growth has turned positive again.”

The wealthy have had an additional impetus to save. Those in higher-income households, who have the luxury of letting their spending ebb and flow with the economic winds, have made hay from the higher interest payments they accrue from keeping savings in a bank, Smith says.

Wealthier households are “taking advantage” of this more appealing yield, especially those who have mortgages and were still enjoying paying a fixed payment at low, pre-cost-of-living-crisis levels.

Literacy lags

But there is also another, less orthodox theory. One espoused by European Central Bank (ECB) rate setter Isabel Schnabel during a speech on Thursday evening.

Higher-than-expected saving rates is not an issue restricted to the UK, and Schnabel said that Europeans’ reluctance to spend could, in some cases, be down to low financial literacy levels. People with a less sound understanding of their finances still think the macroeconomic environment was the same as during the parsimonious period of 2022-23.

“Over the past three years, real private consumption has increased more slowly than real disposable income,” she said. “This can be partly explained by household misperceptions of their real income developments.”

She added that even though over half of households in the euro area enjoyed income growth in real terms in 2024, “only 11 per cent perceive that their real income had increased”.

While Schnabel’s comments applied specifically to Europe, there is a read across to the UK; specifically with inflation expectations. The Office for Budget Responsibility – and several other economic bodies – believe inflation will come in at about 3.2 per cent in 2025. The average punter, on the other hand, is more pessimistic, They expect inflation of 3.5 per cent this year, according to a recent poll from Citi and YouGov, furthering, in their mind, their incentive to save.

Panmure Liberum’s Simon French event went as far as to call these inflation expectations “concerning” in a recent note.

And he will not be alone. Desperate to free the economy of its zero sum game strait jacket, the Chancellor – not to mention our embattled high street and hospitality sectors – will also be hoping that this nation of savers can find it in them to spend us out of trouble.",cityam

Historically, economic progress has been driven by seismic shifts in how we value things.

From the agrarian economies that once sustained early civilisations, to the industrial revolutions that mechanised production – each era reshaped society’s priorities.

In the late twentieth century, the rise of the ‘knowledge economy’, placed information and cognitive thinking at the heart of progress.

But today, as the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) accelerates, we find ourselves at another crossroad.

“The ‘knowledge’ based economy is on its way out”, said Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, “and an innovation economy, is on its way in”.

A shifting economy

For decades, the knowledge economy reigned supreme. It thrived on the ability to process, store, and distribute information. But since then, AI has fundamentally changed the game.

Machines can now analyse vast amounts of data, identify patterns or generate human-like text in the matter of seconds – tasks that once required years of expertise. Yet, as AI takes over knowledge-based work, information alone is no longer enough.

It falls short in defining the problems worth solving, or imagining a future that does not yet exist.

In response, a new economy is taking shape – one built on human capabilities that AI cannot replicate.

The real breakthrough lies in understanding where AI’s capabilities end, and when human strengths take over.

Human creativity has started taking precedent over the rote accumulation of knowledge, as the operative question pivots from ‘what is left for humans after AI?’, to ‘what is possible when they work together?’

Business leaders have already recognised this shift. LinkedIn data revealed that 90 per cent of C-suite executives reportedly consider AI as a top priority, with businesses pouring billions into AI-driven automation and decision making.

According to Accenture, 73 per cent of companies are channeling their digital investments into AI, recognising its potential to boost productivity and unlock entirely new markets.

AI and the workforce myth

Despite fears of AI replacing jobs, the reality is more nuanced.

By 2030, nearly 70 per cent of the jobs that will exist have yet to be invented. This presents a paradox where AI will replace certain tasks, but it will also create entirely new industries and career paths.

What’s more, the rapid advancements in AI from leading tech heavyweights are making automation cheaper than hiring employees.

The AI market is projected to surpass $800bn (£618.19bn) in 2030, with AI agents handling a growing share of business functions.

Chinese startup DeepSeek proved to global tech players just how affordable AI-powered systems can be, launching an advanced chat bot at a fraction of the cost of similar, US developed models.

Read more The Spring Statement is an opportunity to secure the UK’s economic future

The real challenge, however, won’t be job losses – or the idea of being ‘replaced’. Rather, it will be whether organisations or individuals are prepared to redefine their roles.

“We are moving from an era of humans supporting technology, to one where technology supports human potential”, added Raman.

As Jensen Huang, chief executive of chip giant, said: “You’re not going to lose your jobs to AI, but rather to someone who uses it.”

In the UK, the anaemic growth of IT skills among Brits has widened the AI skills gap – meaning we don’t have the level of expertise across the country to accommodate this shift.

IT and AI positions were reportedly the hardest recruit for in 2025, with 43 per cent of business leaders considering hiring talent internationally instead.

The lost Einsteins

While leaning towards innovation promises a new frontier of economic growth, systemic barriers continue to hold back potential pioneers.

A sobering reality remains that economic privilege still plays a significant role in determining who can innovate successfully.

Research from MIT reveals that children from high-income families are 10 times more likely to become inventors than their lower income peers.

Economists have coined this phenomenon the “Lost Einsteins” problem – a term that encapsulates the vast potential squandered due to socio-economic disparities.

If the innovation economy is to thrive, businesses and policymakers must commit to breaking down those barriers, by prioritising diverse hiring and creating pathways for underrepresented talent to enter the workforce.

Governments should rethink education systems to prepare students for a world where adaptability will be more important than memorising facts, or risk leaving millions behind in the AI boom.

The synergy of humans and AI

The conversation around AI has too often been framed in extremes – either as a dystopian, job-thieving technology, or an over-hyped trend with limited impact.

This is now giving way to a more balanced perspective, where fostering effective collaboration between humans and AI, will unlock human potential on an unprecedented scale.

Organisations should therefore develop roles that integrate this collaboration, which necessitates a cultural shift towards cross-functional approaches.

People using AI will drive personalised learning and development, fostering a culture of continuous adaptability.

There will be drawbacks, like increased pressure on workers and ethical concerns, but ultimately, those who leverage AI will set themselves apart.

While AI might just be the most powerful tool of our time, at the end of the day, it is just that: a tool. It doesn’t stand without human interaction.",cityam

Rachel Reeves’s good intentions mean nothing against rising inflation, meagre growth and falling employment, writes shadow secretary of state for work and pensions Helen Whately

One thing that I don’t think can be doubted about Rachel Reeves is her intentions. Like any Chancellor, of course she wants to achieve growth, prosperity and higher living standards. Of course she wants investment to increase, government debt to fall and unemployment to decline.

The problem isn’t her intentions. It’s that every single action she has taken has undermined them.

Labour progress report: Inflation up, growth down

Let’s start with inflation. Her stated aim is to hold it at the two per cent target she inherited from the last government. Instead, she has pumped £70bn a year extra into public spending – including huge public sector pay rises – and inflation has risen nearly a per cent since Labour have been in office.

This has caused interest rates to stay higher for longer. That’s not just a problem for businesses and households. As we found out last week, higher government borrowing costs have contributed to wiping out her entire fiscal headroom and left a £14bn hole in her figures.

Then you look at economic growth, which she has described as “the number one mission of this government”. Even in that statement there is a fundamental misunderstanding. Because it is not government that creates growth, it’s businesses.

Instead of supporting them, she has slapped huge taxes on them. Billions in National Insurance rises, huge hikes in Business Rates. Taxes that prevent businesses from actually investing in things that create growth.

At the same time, she spent her first six months in office talking down the UK economy for political gain. We have gone from the green shoots of recovery to the lowest level of business confidence on record outside of the pandemic, all since Labour have been in office.

Read more Spring Statement: Watch out for income tax hikes in the autumn

Reeves refuses to admit she has got it wrong

The result of this were depressingly predictable. And yet, it genuinely seemed to take them by surprise when last week the OBR slashed this year’s growth forecasts in half.

She says she wants to get people off welfare and into work. But a combination of the National Insurance rises and Employments Rights Bill will mean there will be fewer jobs available, and businesses less willing to take a chance on people. According to the OBR, 160,000 fewer people are now expected to be in work this year.

On and on it goes. She says she wants to get more young people into employment and training. But she has made it £4,000 a year more expensive to hire an 18-year-old from April, and halved the number of apprenticeships available. There are now 100,000 more young people out of work, education and training since Labour took office.

Last week we saw in black and white every key economic indicator going in the wrong direction. It was as clear a rejection of Labour’s economic strategy as you are likely to see.

But instead of admitting that they have got it wrong, still they press on. The Jobs Tax kicks in this week. Instead of welfare reforms they have announced rushed cuts. The £5bn cost of Employment Rights Bill hasn’t even been factored in by the OBR yet.

Labour talk again and again about protecting ‘working people’. But nobody benefits if in five years the country’s economy is on its knees. Not everyone can work in the civil service and people need jobs to do at businesses that succeed.

It’s time to turn back. Good intentions are not enough, and the country simply cannot afford for this government to keep making the wrong calls.

The big Formula 1 news of last weekend was the demotion of Liam Lawson from Red Bull to junior sister team Racing Bulls.

The big Formula 1 news of last weekend was the demotion of Liam Lawson from Red Bull to junior sister team Racing Bulls.

His former teammate Yuki Tsunoda has been promoted to the senior team to partner four-time world champion Max Verstappen, while Lawson will line up alongside Isack Hadjar in what is now a very inexperienced team.

Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko said last week that his team made a mistake with their decision-making over Lawson.

Not good enough

“His performance was unfortunately not good enough and that comes from self-confidence,” he added.

“He’s not kicked out of F1 and Racing Bulls will give him the chance to recover and his career will start again.

“For the benefit for him, he goes back to Racing Bulls, which has a car capable to be top 10 in qualifying and the race.

“Just look in the past, it was [Pierre] Gasly, it happened the same, also to [Alex] Albon and they recovered and they are now competitive F1 drivers.

Read more Tsunoda to be promoted to Red Bull F1 as Lawson relegated

“On top of it, the RB21 is a car which is not the fastest car but nevertheless very difficult to drive and Max can handle but not at this stage Liam.”

But can a sudden and forced relegation to a sister team leave Red Bull open to legal action from Lawson, whether it be for potential loss of earnings or reputational damage?

Lawson case?

If it were to occur, it wouldn’t be the first case involving Formula 1 this season with McLaren set to take on former roster driver Alex Palou over contract details.

Andrew Street, partner in BCLP’s business and commercial disputes team, told City AM: “Ultimately any claims that Lawson might be hoping to bring will stand or fail on the basis of the specific terms of his contract with Red Bull.

“However, most well advised teams with sister operations are likely to have negotiated and agreed wide contractual discretions to allow them to move drivers between the different parts of their operations.

“That type of discretion can make claims difficult in all but the most extreme circumstances”

It appears, then, that Lawson might just have to deal with his demotion by proving himself on the track.",cityam

The geopolitical tensions surrounding the trade war of US President Donald Trump and uncertainty about economic growth and inflation development caused considerable movements in financial markets in March. That ultimately also affects the wallets of citizens.

For example, European plans to invest heavily in Defense, which means that, among other things, the German government wants to borrow more, has caused an increase in capital market rates in Europe. This effect was raised to the mortgage market, where lenders have also increased the interest rates, since their own loan costs have risen.

On the other hand, international oil prices have fallen due to a combination of lower economic growth expectations and a higher supply of oil. This again affects fuel prices of gasoline and diesel, among other things.

House price: again a significant increase of more than 10%

Source: CBS/Land Registry

House prices increased on average by 10.6 percent in February compared to the same month a year earlier, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). The increase has decreased slightly compared to January, when the average home was 11.5 percent more expensive on an annual basis.

That does not mean that there has been a sharp increase in the average house price of more than 10 percent for eight months in a row. The average transaction price amounted to 467,363 euros in February, compared to 427,279 euros in the same month last year.

The average home has become 40,000 euros more expensive in twelve months.

The cause of the substantial increases is still the tight supply and the large demand for homes. The latter is also fueled by the salary increases after the Coronapandemie, which ensure that more buyers can pay a home.

The cabinet wants to build 100,000 homes a year to reduce the housing shortage, but that has not been possible so far. And it does not look like that this goal will be achieved in the coming years. Woonminister Mona Keijzer focuses on ""removing obstacles"" for new construction, such as stacking local rules and procedures.

At the same time, housing construction has had to endure a huge setback by the ruling of the Council of State at the end of last year. The Council ruled that a new permit should be applied for if a new project such as new construction, shot material will emit. Even if the nitrogen space was already licensed.

Mortgage interest: relatively large increase due to geopolitical developments

The mortgage interest rates were brought in in March, after they fell slightly in February. Lenders have suddenly increased interest rates, as a result of rising interest rates on the capital market that influence the fixed mortgage interest rates.

The interest rates on the financial markets rise, among other things, due to the constant threat of President Donald Trump of the United States to increase import tariffs and the European investment plans for the reinforcement of the continent.

In mid -March there was the biggest rise in mortgage rates in 2.5 years. The average interest of the most popular mortgage, that of 10 years with NHG insurance, rose by 0.2 percentage points.

Before Trump took office in January, the interest rates for 10 years were still around 3.5 percent for mortgages with NHG and around 4 percent without. These interest rates have now risen to 3.81 and 4.19 percent respectively, as the graph above shows.

However, the interest rates per lender can differ considerably. At the moment, with Mortgages for 10 years, NHG is about 1.4 percentage point difference between the highest and lowest interest rates, and 1.95 percentage point for mortgages without NHG.

Saving: Inflation rises, savings interest falls

The highest variable savings interest rate has fallen, while inflation has risen. That is bad news for savers who are more than able to keep their savings more valuable.

In March, the highest variable savings interest rate of Dutch savings accounts to 2.3 percent dropped, according to data from the site savings information.nl. A month earlier, the highest variable savings interest rates were still 2.4 percent. In the meantime, inflation has made an inverted movement - this rose again.

In February, products and services in the Netherlands were 3.8 percent more expensive than in the same month last year, the CBS reported. This means that inflation is at a higher level compared to January, when products and services were 3.3 percent more expensive on an annual basis.

Dutch inflation is higher than the 2 percent that is being sought in the eurozone. The average inflation in the eurozone was 2.4 percent in February and is therefore considerably below the Dutch inflation level.

Stock exchange: whimsical month, but AEX still in the Plus in 2025

March is a rather whimsical month on the stock exchange, with price falls in the first half of the month and recovery in the second half. For European stock markets such as the AEX index, this means that there are still clear pluses on the signs since the start of the year. This year, the Amsterdam main index is currently achieving a profit of more than 4 percent.

For American scholarships, the recovery of the second half of March is not yet strong enough to the earlier losses from the erasure. Since the start of the year, the S&P 500 index has been at a minus of more than 5 percent.

The relatively lean performance of American stock exchanges can be traced back to great uncertainty about the trade policy of President Donald Trump and concerns about economic cooling in the US. In addition, the valuation of shares in the US is relatively high, which ensures limited space for setbacks.

Analysts from Bank of America expect that if the US economy ends up in a recession, a further decrease in the S&P 500 index is more than 10 percent possible.

Gasoline and diesel: prices fall

Prices of petrol and diesel were clearly fallen in March. In the second half of the month, a liter of unleaded gasoline cost an average of 1.89 euros, or about 8 cents less than a month earlier.

The average diesel price was 1.67 euros in the second half of the month, which corresponds to a decrease of approximately 7 cents in a month.

Oil prices on the international market, especially in the second half of February and early March, fell sharply, and then again lights up again to around $ 73 per barrel at the end of March. Here too, the combination of uncertainty about the impact of the import duties of the US President Trump plays a role, in combination with the intention of the OPEC OPEC+ OPEC Opec+ to market more oil from April.

Electricity: lower variable and fixed prices

Average power price in kWh per term (excluding taxes)

Stream prices fell for variable and permanent contracts in March compared to the previous month.

The graph above based on data from financial comparator PriceWise shows that the average variable electricity price (dark blue line) is cheaper again in six months than permanent contracts with maturities of 1 year and three years (orange and green line).

Variable electricity prices for new customers fell on average by 6 percent in March. The table concerns 'bare' prices excluding the energy tax and VAT.

The fixed 1-year and 3-year contracts have also fallen in price, by 6 percent and 5.5 percent respectively, reports PriceWise. ""The differences between the contracts are small. That makes it difficult to make a choice, at least more difficult than last year when the differences between the contracts were greater. A year ago, the 3-year permanent contract for electricity was considerably more expensive than the 1-year contract. The cheapest was the variable contract at the time, making it a more attractive choice.""

Gas: decrease prices, 1 year fixed most

Average gas price in M3 per term (excluding taxes)

After almost a year of price increases, a peak seems to have been reached as far as gas prices are concerned. A falling movement has been started since mid -February.

In the above graph of PriceWise you can see that especially gas contracts that are set for 1 year (Oranje Lijn) have experienced a competitive price decrease. In March it was a decrease of 7 percent compared to the previous month. This makes 1-year contracts with gas on average the least expensive.

The average variable gas price (blue line in the graph) showed an increase of 1 percent in March, while the 3-year contract (green line) fell by 3 percent in price. The graph can be seen that the average rates for 1 year fixed relatively strongly from the variable rates and the gas prices for 3 years.

Compared to a year ago, however, gas prices are still considerably higher. The contracts for 1 year are fixed in March this year 35 percent above the level of March 2024.

In view of the mobile purchasing markets, low gas reserves and geopolitical developments, a contract with a fixed price is still obvious, according to PriceWise.

一方、イーロン・マスク氏率いるテスラは、高価なLiDARセンサーを搭載せずとも光学カメラのみで自動運転車を大規模展開することができるとの立場だ。

コストの観点からLiDARセンサーを不要とするテスラの主張に、クラフチック氏はこう反論する。

ウェイモに競合相手はいない

2021年4月にウェイモを離れ、現在はロバート・J・スカリンジ氏率いるリビアン（Rivian）の取締役を務めるクラフチック氏は、米中両国はじめ複数の企業が自動運転車を使った配車サービスを世界中で開発・展開しているものの、ウェイモの独走状態に変化はないと断言する。

中国のバイドゥ（Baidu、百度）が展開するロボタクシーサービス「アポロ・ゴー（Apollo Go）」は2024年第4四半期だけでおよそ110万回の配車実績を記録した。

アマゾン（Amazon）が2020年6月に買収したズークス（Zoox）は目下、カリフォルニア州サンフランシスコとネバダ州ラスベガスで試験走行を積み重ねており、2025年下半期にも商業運行を開始する計画だ。

テスラも前出のサイバーキャブを使った配車サービスをテキサス州オースティンで6月に開始する（とマスク氏が公言している）。

一方のウェイモはカリフォルニア州ロサンゼルス、サンフランシスコ、アリゾナ州フェニックスでロボタクシーサービス「ウェイモ・ワン（Waymo One）」を展開し、配車実績はすでに週20万回以上に及んでいる。

オースティンやジョージア州アトランタでも配車サービス大手ウーバー（Uber）と提携して自動運転サービスを提供しており、さらに米国外での初展開に向けて東京でも走行試験に乗り出している。

「現時点で言えば、ウェイモに競合相手はいません」

そう語るクラフチック氏によれば、ウェイモはサービス規模、安全性、性能の観点で圧倒的な優位性を誇り、今後3〜5年は他社に追いつかれそうにないという。

「あらゆる車両に統合可能な、免許証を有する人間の運転を代行するエンボディード（身体性をもって物理世界と相互作用する）AIの社会実装に成功、なおかつサードパーティーのデータを用いてその規模を拡大し、運転能力と安全性について人間のドライバーに対する顕著な優位性を実証した唯一の企業がウェイモなのです」

またズークスに関して、クラフチック氏は「大きな期待」を寄せており、「市場参入に向けた慎重かつ入念な取り組み」を高く評価した。ただし、そのサービス運営規模は2018年にウェイモが初めてロボタクシーを展開した時に比べると見劣りするという。

さらに、中国企業についてクラフチック氏は具体名には言及しなかったものの、（中国国内より当局による規制が厳格と見られる）米国内でのサービス展開に至っていないことを踏まえ、ウェイモ並みの自動運転性能を実現できているとは考えにくいと指摘する。

例えば、トヨタ自動車の大規模出資先で2024年11月に米ナスダック上場を果たしたポニー・エーアイ（Pony.ai、小馬智行）は、カリフォルニア州で試験運転中に交通違反を複数回繰り返し、2022年5月に同州自動車局から無人運転の許可を取り消されている。

配車サービスは「最終目的地」ではない

クラフチック氏によれば、ウェイモは当初から配車サービスの実現だけを目指してきたわけではなく、現在も「ウェイモの自動運転車への（優先的もしくは無制限の）アクセスを保証する」サブスクリプションサービスや、大型トラックもしくは自家用車にもデプロイ可能な自動運転ソフトウェアの製品化まで見据えているという。

そうした大きな成長余地を踏まえて、アナリストの中にはウェイモの新規株式公開（IPO）や親会社アルファベット（Alphabet）からのスピンアウトを予想する向きもある。

資産運用会社ディープウォーター・アセット・マネジメント（Deepwater Asset Management）のジーン・マンスター氏は2024年11月、ウェイモが2〜4年以内にアルファベットからスピンアウトし、2030年には評価額3500億〜8500億ドルの巨大企業（OpenAIの最新評価額が3000億ドル）に成長するとの見通しを語っている。

I, who buy almost all of my groceries at Costco, recently became an executive member.

My family loves Pura Vida's open fire grilled root vegetables and Kirkland Signature's Chicken Pot Pie.

I also buy Kirkland Signature diapers, Clorox toilet cleaners, and glasses at Costco.

We, who have been a Costco member for eight years, recently decided to upgrade to executive membership. The annual fee is $65 (about 10,000 yen), but most purchases will receive up to 2% return.

Costco has raised the annual membership fees for executive members from $120 to $130 this year, but for our family of four, it's definitely worth it. This is especially true given that I buy most of my groceries from Costco.

Here are some of our favorite products that will make the most of our executive membership.

Pura Vida's direct-fire grilled root vegetables contain sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, red onions, and more.

It is seasoned with extra virgin olive oil, pink Himalayan salt and black pepper, but at home, we add a little honey to eat. Because it gives it a glossy finish and makes it even tastier.

Cooking in a non-fryer will give it a better texture.

https://businessinsider.com,"[Sato Yu] Where did the obsession with ""I have to become someone"" come from?",https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/291919b/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 07:00:00 GMT","佐藤さん：資本主義社会において、資本家は拡大再生産によって資本をどんどん増やしていきます。言い換えると、資本はつねに自己増殖を続けるということです。

シマオ：えーっと、経営者（資本家）は会社を作って人を雇って儲けを出して、その儲けでまた会社を大きくして、売り上げも増えていくってことですよね？

佐藤さん：その通りです。そして企業は、競合企業と熾烈な競争を繰り広げることになります。その競争を勝ち抜くためには、そこで働く人たちも常に競争し合い、生産力や競争力を高めていくことが求められます。

当然、企業はそんな競争社会に適応した人材を求めます。受け入れられるには、学生の頃から競争社会の中で能力を高め、勝ち抜いていく必要がある。

シマオ：なるほど……。中学受験も、その競争原理が幼い子どもたちにまで及んだ結果ということなんですね。

佐藤さん：そういうことです。そしてそこから、shoe-realさんが言う、「自分は何者かでなければいけない」とか、「人より幸せでなければならない」という強迫観念が強く出てくる訳です。競争意識が内面化した結果です。

シマオ：でも、それって純粋な向上心とは違うんでしょうか？

佐藤さん：本来、向上心というのは過去の自分と比較して成長を喜ぶものです。人目を気にして無理に努力するものではありません。やたら人と比較したり、劣等感や優越感を感じたりするというのは、それが社会によって作られた価値観、基準や評価によっているからです。

シマオ：いろいろ語学を学んだり、資格を身につけたりするというのも、そういう部分があるのでしょうか？

佐藤さん：もちろん自分自身の能力を向上させ、自信を持つことは大事なことです。ただ、そうやって誰もが必死に自分の能力を高めてくれたら国や企業にとってはありがたい。だからあえて向上心を煽るということもあるでしょう。

シマオ：作られているというのは、そういう意味なんですね。

佐藤さん：それに、いい成績を出すには塾に通ったり教材を買ったりしますよね。するとそれに対応した教育ビジネスが儲かる。とにかく人の欲望や不安をかき立て、「何とかしなきゃ」「頑張ってやらなきゃ」と思わせて購買意欲につなげるというのも資本主義の構造な訳です。

シマオ：怖いなぁ……。自分が自主的に頑張っているつもりでも、実はそれが大きな構造の中で踊らされているだけなのかもしれないってことですよね。

佐藤さん：その通りです。それが「資本主義が身体化される」ということです。本人も気づかぬうちに「資本主義で生きる仕様」になってしまう。

シマオ：自分の意志で選択していると思っているからタチが悪いですね……。でも自分がどっぷりと浸かっている社会の仕組みを意識するって難しくないですか？

佐藤さん：実はエリートほどその罠にはまってしまうんです。なぜならエリートこそ、その社会構造に最も適応し、それによって評価されてきた人たちだからです。おそらく、sho-realさんも受験エリートだったんじゃないでしょうか。

シマオ：確かに。大企業に勤めても自分が何者かになれる訳ではないと分かったとありますから、そうかもしれないですよね。

脱却のための「ゼロからの『資本論』」

amazon

佐藤さん：資本主義の人格化から脱却するための一冊を薦めておきましょう。斎藤幸平さんの新刊、「ゼロからの『資本論』」です。斎藤さんは東大を中退してドイツでマルクスについて学び、いま東大の准教授を務めている若手の学者です。『人新世の「資本論」』がベストセラーになったので、知っている方も多いでしょう。

シマオ：マルクスの資本論をいまの時代に合わせて分かりやすく解説していることで話題になりましたね！

佐藤さん：斎藤さんは共産主義のような国家単位での大きな話ではなく、地域の人たちの集まりや市民社会という、小さな単位でのつながりに資本主義を脱構築するヒントがあると指摘しています。

つまり、人間はもともと仲間を作り、助け合うことで進化し歴史を築き上げてきた。資本主義的な競争社会というのは実は近代以降の非常に特殊な形態で、本来人は互いに協力し合うことに喜びと価値を見出してきたということです。

シマオ：資本主義的な競争社会で人間がずっと生きてきた訳ではないってことですね。ましてや、10歳から受験戦争するなんて……。

佐藤さん：そうです。私たちが当たり前だと考えている資本主義社会というものを相対化するには、この社会を構造的に捉え、別の価値観で見直す「理論」が必要なんです。本来、マルクス経済学がその役目を担ってきたのですが、ソビエト崩壊後、無価値で時代遅れの理論というレッテルを貼られてしまった。斎藤さんはそのマルクスの理論をより現代に適合させた形で復活させた一人でしょう。

シマオ：ぜひ僕も読んでみたいと思います！

佐藤さん：何より、資本主義社会というのは科学やテクノロジーの進化と歩みを同じくしているため、どんどん加速していくのが特徴です。例えばグラハム・ベルが電話を作って、それが5000万人に使われるようになるまでには75年の時間がかかったそうです。

同じように、特定のモノやサービスが5000万人に使われるようになるまでかかった時間を比べてみると、テレビが22年、パソコンは14年、携帯が12年、インターネットは7年と、どんどん早くなる。そしてYouTubeが4年、Twitterが2年で、LINEはたった1年、『ポケモン GO』に至ってはなんと2週間。世の中のスピードがどんどん速くなっているのが分かるでしょう。

シマオ：本当ですね……。異常なまでの加速ぶりです。

佐藤さん：私たちの生きる社会は加速度的に回転を速めるメリーゴーランドのようなものです。みんな必死でしがみつきますが、どんどん振り落とされる。特に東京のような大都市だとそれが顕著です。だから受験勉強もどんどん難しくなるし、会社の仕事もどんどん高度になり、量も増えていく。ポスト争いも激しくなる。

シマオ：なんだか、年を経るごとに生きるのが大変になっていくようですね……。

佐藤さん：だから、押し付けられた競争＝ゲームからどこかで「降りる」という選択が必要なんだと思いますよ。

世の中からちょっと軸足をずらす

シマオ：おそらくshoe-realさんも競争の虚しさにどこかで気が付いているんだと思います。でも正直、若くしてそこから降りるのは難しい気が……。

佐藤さん：であれば、競争に参加しながらもその価値観だけに染まるのではなく、もっと別の、自分なりの価値観を持っておくといいでしょう。それだけでもずいぶんいろいろなものを相対化して見ることができるはずです。

シマオ：例えば、趣味とか恋愛とか、友人関係とかでしょうか？

佐藤さん：はい。友人関係で言えば、現在いる友人に限定する必要はありません。斎藤さんも言うように、仕事やビジネスとは関係ない人間関係をどう築くか。例えば、趣味のサークルだとか読書会だとか共通のテーマでつながる人間関係を持つ。あるいはバーやスナック、飲めない人なら喫茶店などの常連になって、同じ常連さんと友達になるとか、そういう人間関係を築くことも一つの手だと思います。

このような関係を「アジール」と呼ぶのですが、利害関係のない、ホッとできる仲間のような関係性を指します。その中で見返りを求めないやり取りをする。例えば集まった仲間に自分が旅行先で買ってきたお土産をあげるとか、田舎から送られてきたものを配るとか。対価を求めない関係を築くことが大切です。

シマオ：なるほど。貨幣経済やビジネスとは違う原理での関係ということですね。

佐藤さん：いずれにせよ、自分自身が潰れないためにも、いまの資本主義社会の特異性と異常性に気づかないといけない。どっぷりとその構造に浸ってしまっている都会型のエリート層ほど、脱出するための「理論」を身につけたり、相対化するための価値観を育てていったりする必要があるということです。

シマオ：まずは、自分たちを取り巻く構造とその状況を客観的に知ることが大事だということですね。shoe-realさん、参考になりましたでしょうか。

Jaws, which is said to be the first blockbuster film, marks its 50th anniversary since its release.

The film, released in 1975, sold at $260.7 million.

The production is well known for its various issues and complex situations.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the film, which quickly made Steven Spielberg famous and redefines box office success.

Jaws, released in the United States on June 20, 1975, was said to be the first ""smash hit film,"" and created a new genre of high-performance films from major studios.

The film, which depicts local police officers, marine biologists and shark hunters chasing a great white shark terrorizing a peaceful town, faces a variety of production challenges, including filming offshore and dealing with a constantly breaking down mechanical shark.

Spielberg described this turbulent production site as ""humans vs. eternal sea.""

""It was the ocean that won the battle -- but we won the audience from all over the world,"" Spielberg said in director and writer Laurent Booslow's 2023 book, Spielberg: The First Ten Years.

Here are some facts about Jaws that you may not know.

(Titles omitted)

The novel that was originally written for the film was inspired by a real shark.

Author Peter Benchley said he was inspired by Long Island fisherman Frank Mandas, who caught a shark about 5.2 meters long and weighed about 2 tons in 1964.

In his 1974 novel Jaws, Benchley took inspiration from Mandas' shark hunting career and wrote the character of Captain Quint.

The novel was a huge commercial success and was on the bestseller list for months, the New York Times reported.

The film producers bought the rights to make it into a film before the novel was released.

Before the novel was released, producers Richard Zanak and David Brown had obtained copies of the manuscript.

According to the New York Times, the two who read it bought the rights to make the novel into a film for $150,000 (currently $1.08 million).

Spielberg was 26 years old at the time.

Zanak and Brown approached the two managers before Spielberg. At the time, Spielberg was 26 years old, and the only feature film he had directed was 1971's Duel.

""Jones"" was Spielberg's second feature film.

The film was filmed from May 2nd to October 6th, 1974 on Martha's Vineyard Island, Massachusetts, USA.

""This was the only place on the east coast where you could not see land when you went 12 miles off the coast, and there was a sandy seabed just 30 feet below the surface, where you could set up a shark sled,"" Spielberg told Booslow.

""We wanted the audience to think that the boat would not be able to turn back and return to shore soon. We really needed a 360-degree ocean stage.""",businessinsider

「ブランドの核となる人物の立ち位置としては非常に危ういものです」

就寝の準備時間に参加必須の全社ミーティングを設定すれば、従業員の士気は下がるだろう。

また、従業員の時間は（会社のためにいつでも提供させられるという意味で）無価値との誤ったシグナルを発することで「信頼関係を決定的に毀損」（シリング教授）しかねない。

起業して間もない成長期、初期段階なら、企業として定めた基準や規範を無視して（深夜や週末の作業になりふり構わず取り組むなど）無理を通すこともあるかもしれない。しかしテスラはとうにそうした時期を過ぎている。

「マスク氏はすでにその行動が多くの人々に影響を及ぼし、多くの人々を巻き込む可能性のある存在であり、もはや少年時代の悪ふざけでは済まないのです」

マスク氏はこれまで疑問視されるような問題発言・行動をたびたび繰り返してきたが、なぜか好意的に解釈されて特に深刻な咎（とが）めを受けずにきた。

それでも、テスラの株価が12月に更新した史上最高値から80％下落（3月24日終値時点で42％）するといった深刻な危機に対処せねばならなくなった場合、さすがの熱狂的マスク氏支持者らも寛容ではいられないというのがシュローター氏の見方だ。

過去にはオフィスの床で寝泊まり

マスク氏の仕事に向き合う姿勢が注目を浴びるのは今回が初めてではない。

ミッドサイズ電動セダン『モデル3』の生産遅延からテスラが「地獄」を味わっていた2018年春、マスク氏は工場に泊まり込んで床で寝ていたと公言している。

さらに、2022年10月に買収したツイッター（Twitter、現X）の経営改革を進めていた時期も、自らサンフランシスコ本社のソファで寝泊まりするだけでなく、従業員にも「ハードコア」な働き方を求め、実際に管理職クラスのエンジニアがオフィスの床で寝ている様子が撮影されている。

創業者らしく何でも派手にやるのがマスク流の経営とは言え、就寝時間前の全社ミーティングは準備不足ないし（多忙さにかまけて）会社の有事に気づくのが遅れた事実をさらけ出しただけにすぎない、と前出のシュローター氏はにべもない。

ただ、3月20日深夜の全社ミーティングでマスク氏が発したメッセージは投資家にはそれなりに響いたようで、結果的に翌21日、さらに週明け24日の株価は大きな回復ぶりを示した。

なお、マスク氏がそのミーティングで語ったことを端的に要約すれば、ロボットタクシー「サイバーキャブ（Cybercab）」や人間型ロボット「オプティマス（Optimus）」の市場投入を前に、投資家はテスラ株を「絶対手放すべきではない」ということだった。

カオスな何かを期待する心理

ベストセラー『ロングゲーム』の著者でコロンビア大学ビジネススクールでも教鞭を執るドリー・クラーク氏は、テスラ以外の企業なら従業員が眉をひそめたり不安を抱いたりするであろう突然の深夜ミーティングをなぜかマスク氏が開催できてしまうのは、ほとんどの人が「カオス感があって」型破りな何かを彼に期待しているからだと分析する。

「何しろ、マスク氏は（全米で人気のポッドキャスト番組）ジョー・ローガン・エクスペリエンスでマリファナを吸った人物です」

マスク氏はもともと場当たり的で、感情に左右される経営者として知られ、そういう認識が定着しているゆえに、予測不能で一貫性のない行動も「あえて懸念するほどのことではない」といった受け止めに終始するところがある、とクラーク氏は語る。

そうした現実の文脈を踏まえると、深夜の無茶なミーティングはむしろ、マスク氏がこれまでと変わらず会社の経営を深く気にかけているという従業員へのメッセージと受け止められた可能性もある。

そして、仮にそうだとしても、テスラが抱える課題の解消に向けて具体的に取り組んでいることを示すさらなる行動が後に続かなければ、従業員と投資家のポジティブなセンチメントを維持するのは難しいとクラーク氏は指摘する。

スティーブ・ジョブズ「崇拝」と同じ

前出のシュローター氏も、マスク氏が全社ミーティングを開いて従業員に直接訴えた判断は、一斉メールを送信したり従業員コミュニケーションを担当するチームに一任したりするよりずっと効果的だったと語る。

「たとえビデオ会議だったとしても、従業員の前に姿を見せて語りかけ、感情を見せるだけで全く結果は異なるものになります。経営者も従業員と同じ懸念を共有しているんだと示す効果があるのです」

ただし、そうした方法がどのくらい深く響くかは、従業員側にどの程度「火中の栗を拾う」覚悟があるか次第だという。

アップル（Apple）共同創業者のスティーブ・ジョブズ氏と同じくらい、テスラ従業員のマスク氏に対する忠誠心は高く、長時間労働も含めて何としてでも高い期待に応えようとするだろう、シュローター氏はそう語る。

「イーロン・マスクの存在は唯一のもの。別に私自身が彼を崇拝しているからそう言うのではありません。目の前の事実をありのままに言えばそういうことになるのです」

実際、マスク氏はさまざまな問題が生じても、たいてい従業員の信頼をつなぎ留めて結果を残している。一方で「経営者の99.9％」はマスク氏ほど多くの貢献を従業員に求めることはできないとシュローター氏は結論する。",businessinsider

Mountain climbers are effective exercises that allow you to train your core without having to go to the gym.

However, if the wrong form is applied, such as lowering or rising, the exercise effect will be reduced.

To maximize the effectiveness of mountain climbers, first focus on correct posture and move slowly.

Mountain climbers are bodyweight exercises that allow you to raise your heart rate and train your whole body without going to the gym.

""If you do mountain climbers and other types of planks correctly, you can improve your abs more effectively than crunching,"" Miriam Fried, a New York-based personal trainer and founder of MF Strong, told Insider.

""What people don't realize is that you can't lose some fat and you can't blow away any fat if you do a lot of crunch,"" she says.

""In fact, I would like you to change the idea of ​​'You have to exercise to get a flat stomach' and think of the core as the essential foundation for everything. (In that respect) crunches are not functional.""

Mountain climbers are exercises that help to improve core stability, prevent injuries and improve the effectiveness of other exercises.

However, if you make mistakes that make your lower back unstable or your arms shift, the effect of exercise will be reduced. To maximize the effectiveness of mountain climbers, it is important to focus on planks with correct posture and slow, careful movements, and take steps to longer and faster exercise.

First, let's start with the correct plank posture

To perform a mountain climber, place your hands on the floor under your shoulders, stretch your legs and back straight, and use high planks (planks with your elbows extended) position, where you support your body with both hands and toes.

Planck's posture is effective in increasing overall body strength and stability, and it is well worth the effort on its own.

If you're still working on Plank, try practicing to keep Plank in position for a long time by holding your hands on a box or chair or lifting your knees on the floor.",businessinsider

大和アセットマネジメントの「iFreePlus世界トレンド・テクノロジー株（通称：Zテック20）」が、投資家の間で話題となっている。

これは、いま人気のFANG+だとリスクが高すぎるけど、一般的なインデックス投資では物足りないと感じる人向けの商品だ。

Zテック20とは何か、FANG+とはどう違うのか、詳細を見ていこう。

大型テック株に特化した、オルカン型商品といえるかもしれない。

大和アセットマネジメント（以下、大和AM）が24年末に設定した、「iFreePlus世界トレンド・テクノロジー株（通称：Zテック20）」が、投資家の間で話題になっている。投資対象としている20社は、半導体やIT、電子機器などテック関連企業に限定しながら、アメリカだけでなくグローバルな銘柄から抽出しているからだ。

近年でいえば、テック株10社に均等分散したFANG+指数がトレンドで、そのパフォーマンスの高さが話題となっている。一方で、Zテック20の構成比率は時価総額に応じた加重平均であり、FANG+よりパフォーマンスは劣るが、安定感はありそうだ。

つまり、FANG+はリスクが高すぎるけど、一般的なインデックス投資では物足りないと感じる人向けの商品と言えるかもしれない。Zテック20とは何か、FANG+とはどう違うのか、詳細を見ていこう。

「ルールベース運用」の投信

Zテック20は、2024年12月11日に大和AMが設定した投資信託だ。基準価額は1万円から始まったが、当初から2カ月くらいは堅調に推移していた。しかし、2月末頃から軟調に転じ、3月中旬現在では8600円台を推移している。後述するが同投信の構成銘柄は米テック株が中心であり、ここ最近の市場全体の動きと一致している。

なお、Zテック20という指数はなく、大和AM独自の名称だ。事前に決めたルールに従って投資を行う「ルールベース運用」の投信である。方針をまとめると、主なルールは次の4つだ。

グローバルが対象

日本のほか、特定のリスクが高い中国・ロシアを除く

半導体、ソフトウェア、電子機器、自動車などテクノロジー関連企業

時価総額上位20社を選定（比率は加重平均）

時価総額に応じた構成比率

上記ルールの4つめにある通り、Zテック20は20社で構成されるが、構成比率は時価総額に応じた加重平均となっている。つまり、時価総額が大きい銘柄ほど比率が高い。

2月28日にリリースされた月次レポートによると、上位10社の構成比率は下記の通りだ。比較のためにFANG＋指数との連動を目指す「iFreeNEXT FANG+インデックス」も記載した。

Zテック20 FANG+ 1 アップル 17.1% メタ 10.8% 2 マイクロソフト 14.1% クラウドストライク 10.7% 3 エヌビディア 14.0% ネットフリックス 10.6% 4 アルファベット 10.6% アップル 9.4% 5 アマゾン 9.9% アマゾン 9.3% 6 メタ 8.0% エヌビディア 9.2% 7 テスラ 4.5% マイクロソフト 8.8% 8 ブロードコム 4.4% アルファベット 8.8% 9 TSMC（台湾） 3.7% ブロードコム 8.7% 10 オラクル 2.2% サービスナウ 8.5% 11 SAP（ドイツ） 1.6% - - 12 セールスフォース 1.4% - - 13 ASML（オランダ） 1.3% - - 14 シスコ 1.2% - - 15 サムスン（韓国） 1.1% - - 16 アドビ 0.9% - - 17 サービスナウ 0.9% - - 18 クアルコム 0.8% - - 19 インテュイット 0.8% - - 20 AMD 0.8% - -

Zテック20における構成比率のトップはアップルだ。上位5社で64%、上位10社で87%を占める。一方のFANG＋はテック企業10社への均等分散を基本とし、おおむねねその通りの構成比率になっている。

なお、加重平均（Zテック20）と均等平均（FANG+）には、それぞれ良し悪しがある。当然ながら、各社の時価総額は異なるため、Zテック20のような加重平均では上位企業の構成比率が高くなる。その分、上位企業への依存度が大きく、短期でのリスク分散という点ではFANG+のような均等平均に劣る場面も多いだろう。

ただし、市場全体の動きは時価総額に依存する。そのため、Zテック20のような加重平均の方がインデックスとの相関が大きい可能性が高い。なので、Zテック20はインデックスとFANG+の中間に位置するといえる。

ちなみに、Zテック20の決算は年1回だが、3月末、9月末基準で銘柄入替を実施する方針だという。信託報酬は年率0.495%。最近だと、一般的なインデックスファンドは0.1％を割り込む一方、アクティブファンドは1％前後になる場合が多い。その、まさに中間と言える。

過去実績はS&P500とFANG+の中間

大和AMによると、過去実績においてZテック20は、S&P500とFANG+の中間に位置するという。2015年3月末の数値を100とした場合の24年9月末の数値は、それぞれ次の通りのようだ。

ファンド 2015年3月末の数値を100とした場合の24年9月末の数値 FANG+ 1165 Zテック20 710 NASDAQ100 508 S&P500 331

出展：大和アセットマネジメント

各指数名に付された数字は、そのまま構成銘柄の数を表している（数字の記載がないFANG+は10社）。つまり、上位の指数ほど少数のテック株に集中しており、過去実績上のパフォーマンスは高い。

一方で、チャート上では銘柄数の少ない指数ほどボラティリティが大きくなっている。変動幅が大きく、リスクが高いということだ。

メリット＆デメリット

Zテック20のメリット・デメリットについても考察していこう。まず、わかりやすく一覧表にすると、それぞれ下記の表の通りだ。

メリット デメリット ・少額でテック企業に分散投資できる ・インデックス型よりパフォーマンスが良い ・高リスク地域、低成長地域を除いている ・上位5社の依存度が大きい ・下位10社の影響度が小さい ・信託報酬はインデックス型よりやや高い ・市場に対する逆相関の要素は無い

まずはメリットについて。個別株で20社分を揃えるとなると、多額の資金が必要だが、Zテック20では少額でテック企業に分散投資できる。また、直近10年ではテック企業が世界市場を牽引してきたこともあり、過去のパフォーマンスでは、S&P500などのインデックスよりも優れる。

米中対立が高まるなか、中国を対象外としたのも好材料のひとつだ。日本人としては残念だが、低成長な日本を除外したのも投資家目線では評価できる。そもそも時価総額ランキング30位以内に日本企業はなく、50位以内ではトヨタ自動車しかないのだが……。

次にデメリットを見てみよう。まず、加重平均であるため上位5社の依存度が大きい点が懸念材料だ。上位の1社がショックに見舞われると、Zテック20の基準価額は短期で下落してしまうかもしれない。また、上位10社で9割弱を占めており、下位10社の構成比率は小さい。リスク分散という点で下位10社の存在感は小さくなる。さらに、信託報酬は0.1%前後の商品もあるインデックス型と比較して、やはり高めだ。

また、株式のみで構成されている点も留意しなければならない。ぶっちゃけってしまうと、S&P500やFANG+との差は、おおまかにリスク許容度の違いでしかない。S&P500、FANG+、Zテック20はどれも2月以降の下落局面で軟調に推移している。金価格のように、市場との逆相関関係は無い。

どんな投資家に向いているか

Zテック20はインデックス型と比較して、パフォーマンスは期待できるが、リスクは大きい。そのため人を選ぶところがある。どんな投資家に向いているか、整理しておこう。

1. リスクを許容できる人

筆者は以前よりメインの投資先は、米国型やオルカン型のインデックスファンドにすべきだと主張してきた。だが、サブとしてテーマ型や新興国型など、比較的高リスクな商品に投資するのも有りだと考えている。とはいえ、20社に分散していても、数が少ない分、S&P500などのインデックスファンドよりはリスクが大きい。Zテック20はテーマ型の一種でもあり、リスクを許容できる投資家向けの商品といえそうだ。

2. 高齢者よりは若年層

年齢別で考えた場合、相続を考慮すべき高齢の方は低リスク商品に集中させたほうが良い。「守り」の姿勢で投資先を考えるべきである。ただし若年層であれば、レバレッジを掛けない限り失敗しても問題はない。インデックスよりも高い収益を期待してZテック20に投資するのも選択肢のひとつだ。ただし繰り返しになるが主軸は米国型やオルカン型にすべきであり、あくまでもサブとして位置づけたい。筆者が購入するとすれば、最大でもポートフォリオ全体の20%に抑えるだろう。

3. 特定口座のスポット購入を考えている人

現NISAの年間投資枠は、つみたて投資枠が120万円、成長投資枠が240万円だ。生涯の非課税枠は両枠合わせて1800万円、ただし成長投資枠は1200万円までという制限がある。この枠を埋められる人は限られると思うが、いずれにせよ枠はオルカン型や米国株型で埋めるべきであり、リスク商品は避けておきたい。

Zテック20は成長投資枠の対象商品となっているが、枠が埋まりそうな投資家なら、同投信よりも低リスクの商品にした方が良いだろう。そうした点を踏まえると、スポット購入で何か買いたい、冒険してみたいという投資家向けの商品といえる。

続く下落局面にどう対処するか？

なお、株式市場全体の動きをみると、2月以降、下落傾向が続いている。アフターコロナにおける高成長が一巡したほか、直近では関税をはじめ対外圧力を強めるトランプ大統領の姿勢も影響しているようだ。従来の自由貿易に反する政策が続く限り、市場全体は軟調に推移する可能性が高い。

ただし、投資家が「いつ回復するか？」を予測することはできない。V字回復局面を狙って買いを入れるのは至難の業だ。もしZテック20を買うと決めたなら、回復局面を待たず、今からドルコスト平均法（積立）で買い続けるのが正解といえそうだ。下落局面でのさらなる損失を恐れるなら、分散度の大きいZテック20ではなくインデックスファンドを選んだ方が良いだろう。

まとめ

あらためて「iFreePlus世界トレンド・テクノロジー株（Zテック20）」は、米国を中心とした全世界のテック株20社に、時価総額の加重平均で分散投資する商品である。

過去のパフォーマンスは、S&P500より高く、FANG+よりは低い。その分リスクは、両者の間に位置づけられる。テーマ型の一種と捉えるべきだろう。

新興国型や個別株よりは安全だが、一定のリスクはある。高齢の方よりも若年層向けの商品であり、やや強気な姿勢を持つ投資家向けの商品といえる。",businessinsider

アルバロ・ムネバール・ジュニア（Alvaro Munevar Jr.）は、副業として不動産の事業を立ち上げ、その後、59歳で引退した。

彼は、ビジネス書や個人金融に関する本を読んだおかげで、早期リタイアの準備を整えられたという。

これらの本は、インデックスファンドの運用や、適切なタイミングで見切りをつけるための戦略的な視点を彼に与えた。

私は30年以上にわたり技術職として働き、2024年に59歳で早期引退した。

私が早期リタイアを実現した秘訣は、中間管理職のポジションに留まり、無理のない労働時間を維持することにあった。

そして、自由な時間を経済的に安定する方法を学ぶことに充て、個人金融に関する本を読み、資産管理を徹底的に研究した。

その研究から得た着想をもとに、不動産の副業を立ち上げ、最終的に仕事を辞めるために必要な追加収入を得られるようになった。

私の早期引退への道を支えた5冊の重要な本を紹介しよう。

1. 『金持ち父さん 貧乏父さん』ロバート・キヨサキ著

個人金融に関して多くの著書があるロバート・キヨサキ（Robert Kiyosaki）が1997年に出版したこの本は、お金について私に新たな考え方を教えてくれた示した。

キヨサキは、「貧乏父さん」として自分の父親のことを語っている。彼はお金に関して一般的な感覚を持ち、限られた資金でやり繰りする教育者だった。

一方、キヨサキのメンターとなった「金持ち父さん」は、ビジネスを所有し、起業を通じて富を築くための情報に基づいた手法をキヨサキに教えた。

特に参考になったのは、資産とは「株式や不動産のようにお金を財布に入れてくれるもの」、負債とは「車のローンや衣類のように財布からお金を減らすもの」と定義したキヨサキの考え方だ。

この本を通じて、自分の購買決定がもたらす影響を理解し、不労所得を生み出す資産としての不動産を購入することの重要性を学んだ。

2. 『Bogle on Mutual Funds（ボーグルのミューチュアル・ファンド論）』 ジョン・C・ボーグル著

バンガード・グループ（Vanguard Group）の創設者であり、インデックスファンドの普及を牽引したジョン・C・ボーグル（John C. Bogle）が1993年に出版したこの本は、投資に関する洞察を私に与えてくれた。

ボーグルは、S&P 500のような市場指数のパフォーマンスに基づき運用する低コストインデックスファンドを、さまざまな市場から選択して所有することを勧めている。これは、ファンドマネージャーが個人投資家の資産を運用する高額なアクティブ型投資信託（ミューチュアル・ファンド）よりもコスト面で優れていると彼は述べている。

この本を読んで、長期的にはS&P 500のリターンを上回るアクティブ運用型ファンドがほとんどないことを理解した私は、ポートフォリオにあったアクティブ型ファンドを、ボーグルが推奨する低コストのインデックスファンドへと切り替えた。

自ら銘柄を選び、「市場平均を上回るリターンを得る」ことは刺激的ではあるが、ギャンブルと同様に、長期にわたって成功し続ける個人投資家はほとんどいない。

3. 『The Addictive Organization（嗜癖する組織）』 アン・ウィルソン・シェフ、ダイアン・ファッセル共著

1988年に出版されたこの本は、企業社会で何が問題となり得るのかについて鋭く描かれている。臨床心理学者のアン・ウィルソン・シェフ（Anne Wilson-Schaef）と、経営コンサルタントのダイアン・ファッセル（Diane Fassel）によって執筆された。

本書では、個人の「嗜癖（しへき）」のような不健全なアプローチを取るカルチャーを持つ企業があると説明されている。例えば、道徳に反する問題があってもそれを認めなかったり、従業員を燃え尽きさせるほど過剰な生産性向上を求めたりするといったことだ。

著者たちは、これらの嗜癖的なマネジメント手法が、従業員を過剰にコントロールし、恐怖の雰囲気を作り出すリーダーを生み出すと述べている。

これを読んで、私は企業でキャリアアップを目指す気持ちが薄れ、本業の他に自分のビジネスを始めたいという思いが強まった。

4. 『Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away（見切りをつける：去るべき時を知ることのパワー）』アニー・デューク著

私は2022年に出版されたアニー・デューク（Annie Duke）の本を読み、目が覚める思いだった。そしてアメリカの企業カルチャーを離れて引退したいという気持ちがさらに強くなった。

認知心理学のバックグラウンドを持つ元プロポーカープレイヤーのデュークは、この本で戦略的に仕事を辞める方法、そしてさらに重要な「いつ辞めるべきか」について解説している。

本の冒頭で、デュークはボクシングのヘビー級チャンピオン、モハメド・アリ（Muhammad Ali）のキャリア後半について触れ、彼が年齢を重ねても戦い続け、いつ辞めるべきかわかっていなかったと述べている。

私はこの本を通じて、挑戦しがいがなくなり、面白さも感じなくなったキャリアにさらなる時間を投資するのは間違いだということがわかった。また、同じポジションに長く留まることで機会を失う可能性もあると気づかされた。

5. 『DIE WITH ZERO 人生が豊かになりすぎる究極のルール』 ビル・パーキンス著

引退への最終章に私を導いてくれた本は、2020年に出版されたビル・パーキンス（Bill Perkins）の『DIE WITH ZERO 人生が豊かになりすぎる究極のルール』だ。彼はヘッジファンドマネージャー、起業家、そしてポーカープレイヤーでもある。

この本は、お金の本当の使い方を私に教えてくれた。そして、年齢を重ねるほど、お金を楽しむための時間とエネルギーが減少することを思い起こさせてくれた。

お金の価値は年齢とともに変わる。若くてエネルギッシュな時期には、100万ドルや1000万ドルには途方もない価値がある。それを使って旅行に出かけ、未知の場所を訪れ、趣味を追及し、友人と一緒に時間を過ごすことができる。だが85歳になると100万ドルや1000万ドルの価値は同じようには感じられなくなる。比較的健康であったとしても、エネルギーを必要とする活動を楽しむことは難しくなるだろう。

今、私が持っているお金は、70代や80代になったときよりも価値が高い。それをこの本から学んだ。そして、可能なうちにその財産を楽しみたいという気持ちが強くなった。

個人金融の知識を身につけさせてくれた本

これらの本のおかげで、私は個人金融の知識を身につけ、60歳になる前に引退を果たすことができたと考えている。3、40年前の本もあるが、その教訓は当時と同様に今でも十分に価値があると思う。

これらの本を読んで、資金の動かし方、投資戦略の構築方法、そしてなぜ企業にしがみ続けるべきではないのかについて学んだ。

What can happen with public workers' salaries,https://www.businessinsider.es/empleo/posible-giro-sueldo-funcionarios-enfrenta-gobierno-sindicatos-1450648,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 16:30:00 GMT","Your doctor's salary, your child's teacher or the person who helps you with the income statement for two years without updating. The officials continue to charge, in large part, the same as in 2023.

The pending increase of 0.5%, retroactive since January 2024, has been guaranteed by the Framework Agreement signed with CCOO and UGT in 2022. Although it should have already been applied, the government has not yet detailed when it will be paid. As for the salary increase corresponding to 2025, it has not yet been defined.

Of all these issues there was talk this Monday, March 24 at the meeting that the Executive held with the unions. However, they left it without the Ministry of Public Function, directed by Óscar López, concretized anything about it.

López has committed to CCOO, UGT and CSIF to implement an additional rate so that public sector labor can continue to retire in advance. Also to modify the current regulations so that this right is not lost among the officials. But how much they will raise their salary this year and the next ones has not given clues.

What do the unions demand

What is most urgent is to specify the additional rise of 0.5% of the year 2024 linked to inflation, and that all public employees should charge retroactively since January 1 of this year. Both UGT and CCOO and the Independent and Officials Trade Union Central (CSIF) have urged the Government to approve ""as soon as possible.""

This salary rise culminates the commitments collected in the framework agreement signed by 2022-2024 with CCOO and UGT. Known as ""Agreement for a 21st Century Administration"", this Covenant established salary and labor improvements for public employees. These were agreed that public payrolls are revalued around 10% since the end of 2021. Also a salary rise with a fixed part and another variable, linked to elements such as harmonized IPC or the evolution of GDP.

The agreement expired on December 31 and from CCOO and UGT it is intended to renew with a multinual character. To do this, both unions have claimed in recent weeks the opening of a negotiating table.

From CSIF, mobilizations have also been chosen to speed up these requests. ""The government or takes note, or will have a hot spring,"" said the president of CSIF, Miguel Borra, during the concentration of March 19 against the Ministry of Finance in Madrid.

Government's position

From the Executive they do not oppose these measures. However, they disagree with the unions in the role that the General State Budgets must play.

The unions require negotiating a new multiannual agreement ""independently and detached"" from the negotiation of these, while López's position is to link future salary improvements to the approval of the budgets by 2025.

This in a scenario in which, according to parliamentary arithmetic, from the government a new budget extension is not ruled out.

Other pending issues

Union organizations remember that there are still pending issues. For example, the application of the 35 -hour workday, the reduction of temporality and rejuvenation of the templates.

For their part, CSIF also indicates improvements in a negotiation calendar on the job offer without replacement rate, salary comparison or teleworking in the General State Administration, among other measures.

https://businessinsider.com,Apple TV+: Can the success of criticism and prestige compensate for their failure in terms of profitability?,https://www.businessinsider.es/tecnologia/apple-tv-pueden-exito-critica-prestigio-compensar-fracaso-terminos-rentabilidad-1451730,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 04:00:03 GMT","45 million customers. This is the modest subscriber base of Apple TV+, the streaming platform that the Cupertino company launched in November 2019.

To its brief customer base are added, according to the data released by The Information, annual losses of 1,000 million dollars (920 million euros).

Appletv+ encloses an important contradiction: it has become a maximum exponent of prestige television and razes among the most demanding critics and spectators, but does not glimpse a minimum profitability threshold.

A little over a week APPLE TV+ issued the final chapter of the second season of Severance, a series created by Dan Erickson and directed by Ben Stiller. Severance has become a true cultural phenomenon. It is, in fact, the most watched series in the history of the platform, unbalanced the records of Ted Lasso. It has also been a profitable series. According to the consultant Parrot Analytics, the first season generated more than 200 million dollars (185 million euros) for Apple TV+, an estimate that they have obtained crossing the audience demand with the number of subscribers captured.

These good records, however, fail to hide a much less friendly reality. According to the information of The Information, which quotes company sources, six years and 5,000 million dollars invested (4,620 million euros) annually in content development have not been enough to reach the figures that would be expected from a global service. The platform has 45 million users in the 100 countries where the service is available, although it is not specified how many of those 45 million are for the total amount of the rate or are enjoying free discounts or tests.

This reflects a very low capillarity of the service, especially if the company's hardware coverage is taken into account. It is estimated that there are more than 2,000 million active Apple devices worldwide.

The Information figures allow a little context to be given to a company that does not disseminate financial metrics or Apple TV+subscribers. The streaming business is part of Apple's services segment, which includes Apple Music, the APP Store and other business lines. And that segment, on paper, is profitable. In fact, they registered benefits worth more than 24,000 million (22,2180 million euros in the last quarter of 2024, which represents an increase of 11.9% year -on -year.

Apple's contents strategy has been discussed for many months, especially especially in the film. Some of its most recent premieres, such as pharaonic budget films signed by Martin Scorsese or Ridley Scott, have not managed to turn their spectators as large and loyal to clientele as to justify the investment.

Does Apple TV+ need a strategy change?

Apple TV+ is a peculiar platform since, unlike other services, it only has original content. The absence of a third -party library is precisely what has allowed it to position itself as an exclusive service. But the limitations of that model are more than obvious. The Apple catalog is small if compared to other generalist platforms, something that makes it difficult to justify the 9.99 euros of its rate for an average home. Apple's competitive advantage is, at the same time, its main ballast.

It may be 1 billion a year to be a mere contradiction for the most valuable company in the world. But a service that has been operating for almost six years needs to justify why they are still so faithful to this business model if it fails to recover the investment made.

In recent months we have witnessed several Apple initiatives aimed at correcting this course, from moderation in content spending to aggregation within payment television services (as it has done in Spain with Movistar Plus+). At the moment they do not seem to have raised the incorporation of third party licensed content aligned with its editorial philosophy or the creation of a cheaper plan with advertising. And the truth is that, given the current situation, maybe it should.

https://businessinsider.com,"This is all you should know about the S&P 500, the reference index in the US",https://www.businessinsider.es/economia/todo-debes-saber-sp-500-indice-referencia-eeuu-1451425,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:04 GMT","La gente suele decir cosas como que ""el mercado de valores está en alza"" o ""el mercado está a la baja"", pero el mercado de valores es algo amorfo que abarca miles de acciones y docenas de bolsas de acciones. Lo que a menudo quieren decir es que el valor de un determinado índice bursátil —o conjunto de empresas que cotizan en bolsa— ha subido o ha bajado.

Y, si las personas que dicen ese tipo de cosas están en Estados Unidos, lo más probable es que al índice al que se refieran sea el S&P 500.

Llamado así por el número de compañías que figuran en su lista, el S&P 500 es ""un índice de base amplia que incluye la muestra representativa de sectores económicos como la tecnología de la información, la atención sanitaria y el consumo no esencial, así como las principales organizaciones de los sectores financiero, energético, industrial y de bienes de consumo duradero"", asegura Solomon Tadesse, que dirige la investigación cuantitativa de renta variable norteamericana en Société Générale.

""Como tal, el S&P 500 es un buen indicador del mercado de valores estadounidense y, por extensión, de la economía y sus tendencias a corto plazo"".

Cómo entender el S&P 500

Es importante que los inversores entiendan el S&P 500, tanto si invierten en un fondo indexado al S&P 500 como si no. Aquí vas a poder encontrar todo lo que necesitas saber sobre este indicador tan influyente.

¿Qué es el S&P 500?

Desarrollado por Standard & Poor's (ahora S&P Global), el S&P 500 se lanzó en 1957, pero su estatus como indicador del mercado de valores estadounidense se consolidó en 1968, cuando el S&P 500 se convirtió en uno de los parámetros económicos utilizados por The Conference Board, una organización líder en investigación y afiliación empresarial, para pronosticar las tendencias económicas de EEUU.

Es lo que se conoce como índice ponderado, lo que significa que las empresas con una mayor capitalización bursátil —el valor total de todas sus acciones— representan un porcentaje más alto en el valor total del índice. Eso implica que el índice general se correlaciona más estrechamente con el mercado en general, es decir, las compañías más grandes tienen un efecto descomunal.

El nivel relativo del índice, el valor colectivo de las acciones que lo componen, se expresa en puntos. En marzo de 2025, se situaba en torno a los 5.700 puntos. Así pues, si el S&P 500 experimentase una subida del 10% a partir de ese punto, supondría una ganancia general para el índice de 570 puntos.

Cómo funciona el S&P 500

Criterios de selección de las compañías

Para estar en el S&P 500, las empresas deben cumplir una serie de requisitos específicos:

Tener su sede en Estados Unidos (aunque puede tener operaciones en el extranjero)

Ser una corporación y ofrecer acciones ordinarias en bolsa

Tener una capitalización bursátil de al menos 20.500 millones de dólares (unos 19.000 millones de euros al tipo de cambio actual)

Cotizar en una de las principales bolsas de EEUU (por ejemplo, NYSE o Nasdaq Global Market)

Tener acciones de alta liquidez

Tener ganancias positivas en el trimestre más reciente y tener ganancias positivas al sumar los últimos cuatro trimestres.

Capitalización de mercado y ponderación

Como índice ponderado, las compañías más grandes representan proporciones más altas del índice que algunas organizaciones relativamente más pequeñas, aunque todas siguen siendo grandes en el gran esquema de las cosas. Aun así, al ponderar el índice, un puñado de empresas pueden influir considerablemente en los resultados, para bien o para mal.

En otras palabras, la ponderación de la capitalización bursátil puede hacer que se produzca una concentración sustancial, como ocurrió a principios de 2025, cuando solo 10 acciones representaban cerca del 35% del valor del S&P 500.

Reequilibrio y ajustes

El S&P 500 se reequilibra una vez cada trimestre para reflejar los cambios en la capitalización bursátil, como el aumento de la proporción de compañías en crecimiento y la disminución de la ponderación de las que están en declive. Este proceso de reequilibrio también puede dar lugar a la incorporación de nuevas organizaciones y a la eliminación de otras ya existentes. Los valores que han entrado en los mercados como resultado de una oferta pública inicial (IPO, por sus siglas en inglés), por ejemplo, pueden incorporarse al S&P 500, mientras que algunas empresas que se encuentren en un periodo de recesión podrían salir del índice. Sin embargo, el S&P 500 puede añadir o eliminar firma en cualquier momento, no solo durante estos reequilibrios.

Otros motivos para que se produzcan este tipo de cambios podrían ser que una compañía cambiase su domicilio para establecerse en Estados Unidos, lo que podría permitirle formar parte de este índice de referencia. Las fusiones y adquisiciones también podrían provocar este tipo de movimientos.

Importancia del S&P 500

Punto de referencia para el comportamiento de la bolsa en EEUU

El S&P 500 se utiliza con frecuencia como indicador del valor de toda la bolsa estadounidense, puesto que las acciones que contiene representan aproximadamente el 80% del valor total de las acciones que cotizan en bolsa en Estados Unidos. Muchos inversores lo utilizan como punto de referencia para evaluar su rendimiento en otros activos o fondos. Por ejemplo, un inversor en un fondo de inversión activo podría comparar el rendimiento de ese fondo con el rendimiento del S&P 500 y, si el fondo de inversión no está a la altura, eso podría llevarle a hacer un cambio.

Indicador económico

Muchos piensan que el S&P 500 no solo es una buena forma de medir la fortaleza del mercado de valores, sino también la salud de la economía en general. Los analistas de mercado pueden interpretar las ganancias notables en este índice como una señal alcista para la economía, mientras que las caídas notables podrían presagiar una debilidad en las condiciones comerciales.

Cabe señalar que el valor del S&P 500 fluctúa a lo largo de la jornada bursátil e idealmente valora las perspectivas de crecimiento a futuro, por lo que se considera un indicador adelantado. Mientras tanto, los indicadores económicos más tradicionales, por ejemplo el PIB o la tasa de desempleo, son indicadores rezagados, lo que significa que proporcionan información sobre cosas que ya han sucedido.

El PIB de EEUU, por ejemplo, se publica cada trimestre, aunque la Oficina de Análisis Económico del país norteamericano, la responsable de calcular estos datos, proporciona tres estimaciones diferentes para cada trimestre.

Dicho esto, el S&P 500 no representa a la perfección las condiciones económicas. Algunas compañías pueden estar obteniendo muy buenos resultados en circunstancias más difíciles, como cuando se da un alto nivel de desempleo, por ejemplo.

Sentimiento de los inversores

El índice de referencia estadounidense también puede servir como indicador del sentimiento de los inversores. CNN Business tiene algo llamado Índice de Miedo y Avaricia, que utiliza varias medidas diferentes, incluida una basada en el S&P 500, para determinar cuán temerosos o codiciosos son los mercados.

Más concretamente, el Índice de Miedo y Avaricia examina el valor del S&P 500 y lo compara con su media móvil (MA) de 125 días. Si los valores recientes del índice han sido consistentemente más altos que la media móvil antes mencionada, la situación indica un impulso alcista.

Por el contrario, si los valores recientes del S&P 500 son más bajos que la media móvil de 125 días, esto apunta al nerviosismo de los inversores.

Este gráfico muestra cómo el S&P 500 ha crecido de manera constante en los últimos 50 años. Business Insider

Cómo invertir en el S&P 500

Las estrategias de inversión en el S&P 500 varían según el inversor, puesto que algunos solo invierten en un fondo del S&P 500 como representación del mercado de valores, mientras que otros diversifican su cartera todavía más con diferentes tipos de fondos. No existe una forma universalmente correcta de invertir en este índice, sino que depende de tus objetivos, tu tolerancia al riesgo, tu disponibilidad, entre otros factores

Por ejemplo, tus estrategias de inversión en el S&P 500 en tu cuenta de jubilación pueden diferir de la forma en que invertirías en el fondo en tu cuenta de inversión personal.

En una cuenta de jubilación como una 401(k), puedes invertir en algo como un fondo con fecha objetivo, que invierte automáticamente parte de tus activos en un fondo S&P 500, pero también en una variedad de otros fondos que son apropiados para tu tolerancia al riesgo, en función de tu edad. Mientras tanto, en tu cuenta de inversión personal, podrías invertir en un fondo S&P 500 y, al mismo tiempo, invertir algo de dinero en acciones individuales, si estás dispuesto a asumir más riesgos de los que podrías asumir en tu cuenta de inversión para la jubilación.

Dado que no existe una estrategia de inversión en el S&P 500 adecuada por naturaleza, vas a tener que considerar la posibilidad de hablar con un asesor financiero o de utilizar tecnología como un asesor automático para diseñar un porfolio que tal vez incluya cierta exposición al S&P 500 y también a otros índices.

Dicho esto, si quieres invertir en el S&P 500, algunas formas de hacerlo son a través de:

Fondos indexados

No se puede invertir directamente en el S&P 500, sería como intentar comprar una lista de la compra en lugar de comprar los propios productos que aparecen en ella. En su lugar, se invierte en el S&P 500 a través de fondos indexados, que son como cestas que contienen todos los productos que aparecen en la lista del S&P.

Un fondo indexado es un tipo de producto financiero diseñado para imitar un índice de mercado en particular. Agrupa el dinero de los inversores para comprar un porfolio de acciones u otros valores. En el caso de los fondos indexados al S&P 500, las acciones son las de las empresas que figuran en el índice de referencia.

La mayoría de los fondos indexados son de gestión pasiva, lo que significa que los profesionales de la inversión que los supervisan no negocian mucho con las participaciones. Su objetivo es replicar la composición y el rendimiento del índice, en lugar de intentar superar su valor. Los fondos indexados atraen a inversores orientados a largo plazo, que compran y conservan, y que intentan dejar que sus activos crezcan en piloto automático.

Algunos fondos indexados son fondos de inversión, mientras que otros son fondos que cotizan en bolsa (ETF). En ese caso, la estructura de propiedad es un poco diferente, pero la principal diferencia es que puedes comprar y vender ETF a lo largo de la jornada bursátil, y el precio se actualiza en tiempo real, en lugar de después del cierre de cada jornada. Sin embargo, los fondos de inversión pueden ofrecer algunas ventajas, como que a veces es más fácil invertir en participaciones parciales de fondos de inversión.

Un factor que debes tener en cuenta es que, si bien un fondo de inversión o un ETF pueden estar diseñados para seguir un índice como el S&P 500, no siempre lo hacen a la perfección, y el hecho de no imitar o seguir con precisión un índice se conoce como error de seguimiento.

Básicamente, todas las principales compañías de servicios financieros ofrecen fondos indexados al S&P 500, como:

Puedes comprar estos fondos a través de corredores de bolsa online como:

Y con algunos de los mejores roboadvisors:

En concreto, algunos de los principales fondos indexados al S&P 500 son:

Acciones individuales

Otra forma de invertir en el S&P 500 es comprando acciones individuales. Como se ha indicado anteriormente, siete acciones representan más de un tercio del valor de este índice, por lo que puedes obtener exposición a una gran parte del S&P 500 con un número relativamente pequeño de transacciones.

En cambio, si deseas obtener exposición a este índice mediante la adquisición de acciones individuales, debes tener en cuenta las comisiones y otros cargos relacionados con estas transacciones. Las comisiones asociadas a la compra de acciones pueden acumularse rápidamente, reduciendo así tus ganancias. Además, la compra y el seguimiento de múltiples acciones es una operación muy compleja, especialmente si deseas invertir en las 500 organizaciones que recoge el S&P. Por lo tanto, en muchos casos, invertir en un fondo indexado resulta más práctico.

Ventajas de invertir en el S&P 500

Diversificación

Invertir en el S&P 500 puede ofrecerte una exposición rápida a un conjunto diversificado de acciones, puesto que este índice en particular representa aproximadamente el 80% de la bolsa estadounidense.

Rendimiento histórico

Es especialmente útil estar familiarizado con el rendimiento histórico del S&P 500.

A lo largo de su vida, el índice ha obtenido una rentabilidad media de aproximadamente el 10% anual. Sin embargo, no todos los años ha sido así, ya que algunos han venido acompañados de fuertes caídas. En 2002, por ejemplo, el índice cayó más de un 23% y, en 2008, cayó cerca de un 40%. Aun así, la tendencia a largo plazo ha sido positiva.

Tasas de gestión bajas

Existen innumerables fondos que puedes utilizar para invertir en el S&P 500 y muchos de ellos tienen comisiones bajas. En particular, los fondos indexados son conocidos por tener ratios de gastos muy bajos, que es la comisión porcentual anual que la institución financiera que ofrece el fondo cobra cada año para poder gestionarlo.

Riesgos de invertir en el S&P 500

Riesgo de mercado

El valor del S&P 500 es susceptible al riesgo de mercado, lo que significa que puede fluctuar si cambian las condiciones generales del mercado en su conjunto. Dado que el índice estadounidense está correlacionado con un gran porcentaje de la bolsa en su conjunto, una caída del mercado de valores normalmente también se correspondería con una pérdida de valor del S&P. Incluso si la venta masiva de acciones se origina fuera de las empresas del S&P 500, sigue existiendo el riesgo de que los inversores del S&P también vendan para dar cuenta de estas otras ocurrencias del mercado.

Recesiones económicas

Si las condiciones económicas tienden a empeorar, esto va a provocar con frecuencia que las acciones en general pierdan valor. Los precios de las acciones se basan en las expectativas de rentabilidad futura y los beneficios empresariales disminuyen durante las recesiones. Los inversores también pueden ponerse nerviosos y vender si la economía entra en recesión.

El lado positivo de todo esto es que las fases de expansión de Estados Unidos duran más, de media, que las recesiones. El país norteamericano entró en un periodo de crecimiento del PIB en 1991, por ejemplo, que duró 120 meses, y, a partir de 2009, entró en la fase de crecimiento más larga de su historia, que se alargó 128 meses.

Sin embargo, las recesiones que tuvieron lugar antes de esas mismas fases expansivas duraron entre 8 y 16 meses, respectivamente.

Exposición excesiva a grandes compañías

Algunos analistas de mercado han expresado su preocupación con relación al hecho de que el valor del S&P 500 se concentre en las acciones de muy pocas organizaciones. Esto puede significar que se está arriesgando más en un puñado de empresas del S&P 500 de lo que se cree, en lugar de obtener una amplia exposición al mercado.

Dicho esto, el hecho de que en bolsa haya una alta concentración no es algo necesariamente malo. Por ejemplo, una publicación de Goldman Sachs analizó varios períodos de alta concentración en los últimos 100 años y constató que, en los 12 meses siguientes a estos puntos cruciales, esas mismas acciones tuvieron más probabilidades de subir que de bajar.

Anderson had been fascinated by the potential for additive manufacturing - also known as 3D impression - to transform the world. Page, meanwhile, had led Kittyhawk engineers to explore the use of 3D printing to build pieces of their flying vehicles, believing that it could drastically reduce the cost of production.

Their interests have crystallized in a new startup that have created called Dynatomics, which explores ways to use artificial intelligence (AI) and additive manufacturing to build airplanes, according to commercial documents reviewed by Business Insider and several people familiar with the startup, who have asked to remain in anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the project.

According to these people, Dynatomics is funded by Page and directed by Anderson from Palo Alto, in California. The files show that the business was registered in California in June 2023, and a domain name of the website for Dynatomics was insured around the same moment. The site is almost completely empty, except for a logo and a teaser: ""working on something new.""

Two old Kittyhawk employees who work at Dynatomics studied aerial robotics at Stanford. On his personal website, Anderson describes that he works in a new furtive project ""at the intersection of AI and advanced manufacturing."" For a time he appeared with the name of Dynatomics in his LinkedIn, but later eliminated him.

Anderson, as well as Page representatives, have not responded to Business Insider comments requests.

Additive manufacturing consists of building layers of material on an object. The aeronautical industry already uses this process to reduce the cost and increase the manufacturing speed of some components, but everything becomes more difficult when larger parts are produced or different materials are combined. People familiar with the project claim that Page and Anderson are studying how to use AI to improve the manufacturing process. The Information was the first medium that reported the creation of Dynatomics by Page.

In Kittyhawk, Page asked Anderson and then CEO, Sebastian Thrun, that employees designed flying vehicles with 3D printed parts. Page believed that it would be possible to reduce the cost of building flying cars in several magnitudes using new forms of manufacturing, according to people who worked with him at that time.

In 2023, Dynatomics resorted to a research group from the Technological University of Tallin, in Estonia, who had just won a National Research Award for his work in the additive manufacture of machines. Dynatomics paid 60,000 euros for university for consulting services ""related to additive manufacturing electrical machines"", as recorded in an online database that publishes information about subsidies and a person familiar with the association. The name of Dynatomics was erased from the subsidy after BI contacted the university to ask for it.

A 2023 research work of a researcher at the University of Tallin who consulted Dynatomics described how the use of AI with additive manufacturing can ""mitigate printing failures, reducing waste, costs and production time.""

Page bets on 3D impression

Page was attracted to the idea that 3D printing and cheap components available in the market could offer a new way for electric vertical take -off and landing (Evtol). When he ordered Kittyhawk employees to study a series of projects with 3D printing technology in 2022, Anderson faced some employees who considered that Page asked for things that challenged the laws of physics.

""He knows much more of aviation of what I believed before coming here,"" Anderson told staff during a 2022 meeting with Kittyhawk, whose recording then obtained Bi. ""This is yours."" To illustrate Page's obsession with aviation, Anderson told the staff that Page's son had given his father a Christmas shirt in which he read: ""I am crazy about the planes.""

The frustration sometimes was also in both directions. Anderson took notes in an online calendar that other personnel members could access. In one of them, he wrote how he wanted to fire everyone in the company and start over, according to three Kittyhawk employees who saw the note.

Dynatomics could be his great opportunity. When Anderson began to form his Dynatomics project, he selected at least two people who had worked in a highly secret group within Kittyhawk known as Feather, who dealt with more ambitious and experimental ideas for flying vehicles, and who had a rare direct line with page.

The close links between Page and Anderson

Page's bet for Dynatomics is a commitment to Anderson.

Anglo-American writer and businessman, Anderson was a journalist before becoming a founder of technology companies. He spent his first years studying physics and playing the bass in a post-Punk band called Rem (which culminated in a battle of bands, with the homonym group led by Michael Stipe, which Anderson's band lost).

He later worked as a journalist and editor in The Economist and Wired. In 2009, he was co -founder of the 3D Robotics Drones company, which later sold to Kittyhawk, the new flying taxis company led by Thrun, formergoogle and eminence of the driverless cars, and financed by Page. Anderson later became director of Kittyhawk technology.

Although Anderson and Page knew each other long before the creation of Kittyhawk, ancient employees of the flying car company claim that the two men strengthened ties after the incorporation of Anderson. Anderson often visited Page's house, which was close, to discuss ideas, sometimes in the Page garage, which was full of 3D printers he played with, says one of the people who heard him say to Anderson.

""He is a good engineer, who is what Larry likes,"" says a person familiar with both.

Page's decision to direct Kittyhawk out of Alphabet - which houses a collection of MoNshot projects - allowed him to finance the project without having to answer before the shareholders, who had often scrutinized Alphabet's expense in high -tech ideas such as driverless cars.

In Kittyhawk, Page came to design a flying car that could be manufactured for 50,000 euros, according to former employees, who claim that the company has never come to approach that figure. Dynatomics could allow Anderson and Page to fulfill what was once the ""Kittyhawk promise"" to democratize electric aviation. ""

""One of the reasons why heaven is empty is because it is quite expensive to climb there, and if the planes were as cheap as cars and were manufactured in the same volume as these, the nature of transport and perhaps of our world would change,"" Anderson once said in the vertical space podcast.

He later commented: ""The emptiness of heaven is market failure.""

https://businessinsider.com,Why May 15 is a key date for Nvidia shares,https://www.businessinsider.es/economia/15-mayo-fecha-clave-acciones-nvidia-1451332,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 05:00:03 GMT","According to Bank of America, Nvidia investors have to mark a new date on their calendar.

American investment bank analysts are pending of May 15, the day on which the United States government plans to launch the so -called artificial intelligence dissemination rule, a new regulatory framework that aims to control the access of foreign countries to US microchips from Punta Technology.

These standards would impose restrictions on some Nvidia chips sales and could reduce their market share, but that same event could end up being positive for the company's shares. This is because, once they ""dimension and evaluate"" the generalized geopolitical concerns, Nvidia could recover from its recent fall, Bank of America has indicated this week.

""There is a wide range of results and NVDA shares could continue to be volatile until the date of May 15, when the impact could be reflected in the actions,"" explained the experts of the investment bank.

According to Bank of America, there are many other catalysts that could boost Nvidia actions. Analysts have referred to a possible recovery of GM, which announced an association with NVIDIA earlier this month, as well as the new microchip the company directed by Jensen Huang, the Blackwell Ultra.

During the last presentation of the results of the chips designer, his CEO, Huang, said that Blackwell's demand was already ""extraordinary.""

""Meanwhile, we believe that the actions offer an especially attractive opportunity for one of the most unique and high quality technological franchises that leads the largest and fastest growing sector tendencies,"" said the US bank, referring to the Nvidia business.

Bank of America has reiterated its purchase rating for the shares of this company and has set an objective price for the same of 200 dollars (about 185 euros at the current exchange rate), which implies a 75% rise compared to its current levels. Nvidia shares quoted around $ 110 - 101 euros - this Friday and its value has dropped 20% so far this year.

After having experienced stellar growth for several consecutive years, Nvidia's actions have lost impulse this year because of the incipient concerns about the US dominance in artificial intelligence, as well as the concern generated by Trump's tariffs and the economic perspectives of the American country.

Earlier this month, investors had their eyes on the GPU technological conference - graphic processing units, for Nvidia, known in this industry as the ""Super Bowl of the AI"", in which Huang announced some novelties on the projects of the company that are to come.

The actions have fallen again this week before the news that Nvidia runs the risk of losing business in China, as a consequence of the new energy efficiency standards of the Asian country, which would prohibit the sale of some microchips.

https://businessinsider.com,Openai says that chatgpt could be making its most faithful users feel more alone,https://www.businessinsider.es/tecnologia/openai-dice-chatgpt-podria-estar-haciendo-usuarios-fieles-sientan-solos-1450402,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 06:00:06 GMT","AI makes us more productive, but it also makes us feel more.

Artificial intelligence (AI), like social networks, could be one more in the long list of technologies that make us feel worse.

Openai launched more than two years ago, chatgpt. Since then, it has swept around the world, attracting 400 million weekly active users worldwide.

But, although it makes us more productive, it may also be isolated.

OpenAI researchers and MIT Media Lab have published an article in which millions of chat conversations and thousands of audio interactions with Chatgpt have analyzed. They have also surveyed 4,000 users about their behavior with the Bot.

In another study, the MIT Media Lab has analyzed the interaction of about 1,000 users with ChatgPT for four weeks. Researchers have compiled text and voice data in personal, impersonal and open conversations.

The results have nuances, especially because the feelings of loneliness and social isolation usually fluctuate and can be influenced by various factors. However, researchers claim to have discovered that Chatgpt can worsen the feeling of loneliness in a group of ""advanced users.""

""Our analysis reveals that a small number of users is responsible for a disproportionate part of the most affective signals,"" Openai's joint work and the MIT medium lab. Researchers have analyzed conversations in search of issues such as loneliness, vulnerability, problematic consumption, self -esteem and dependence.

Similarly, MIT researchers have discovered that ""although most participants spend a short time chatting with the chatbot, a smaller number of them does so for significantly longer periods.""

Those who have ""greater daily use - in all modalities and types of conversation - correlate with greater loneliness, dependence and problematic use, and a lower socialization."" The researchers affirm that both loneliness and real levels of socialization have measured to separate the subjective isolation experience of users from their real levels of isolation.

Researchers have observed a vicious circle: Chatgpt's voice mode makes users feel less alone, but the subjects who already felt alone at the beginning of the study were more likely to use the tool in excess and, ultimately, to worsen their state.

In both studies, researchers have analyzed the interaction of users with the advanced chatgpt voice mode, a voice to voice interface.

The bot has been configured in neutral mode or attractive mode. For neutral mode, researchers have used the following prompt: ""You are formal, serene and efficient. Keep a neutral tone regardless of the user's emotional state and answer their questions with clear, concise and informative answers.""

For the sympathetic mode, the bot has been told: ""You are lovely, energetic and captivating. Be sure to express your feelings openly and to reflect the emotions of the user when it seems appropriate to foster a deep sense of empathy and connection in your interactions.""

Advanced users have experienced a greater increase in the feeling of loneliness by interacting with a neutral mode compared to a captivating mode.

Both studies have used chatgpt through GPT-4O, a multimodal model capable of reasoning through the audio, the vision and text that the company presented in May 2024. Last month, Openai launched GPT-4.5, which according to Openai is supposedly a more intuitive and emotionally intelligent model. In neither studies indicates whether OpenAi plans a continuation with GPT-4.5.

However, the problem of studying incipient technologies is that it is still difficult to understand how people feel, especially because people do not usually know how to verbalize their reactions. Years passed before researchers came to understand all the impact that social networks have on mental health.

""In terms of what the teams proposed to measure, people could not necessarily use chatgpt emotionally, but you cannot separate the human being from their interactions [with technology],"" he explains to Mit Technology Review Kate Devlin, a teacher of AI and society at the King's College in London, which has not participated in the research.

https://businessinsider.com,"Silicon Valley's 'coach of dollars': what taught the CEO of Apple, Google or Twitter",https://www.businessinsider.es/desarrollo-profesional/entrenador-billon-dolares-silicon-valley-enseno-ceo-apple-google-twitter-1448958,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:00:06 GMT","Bill Campbell has advised some of the most important names in the technological sector.

Bill Campbell is not a well -known name, but at some point he has had the privilege of having been in contact with some of the most prominent leaders in the technological sector.

Over the years, Campbell, who died in 2016, was a mentor of the main actors in the industry, such as Steve Jobs, Apple, Jack DORSEY, founder of Twitter, and a series of Google executives, from co -founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to the Exceus Eric Schmidt.

Ruth Porrat, president of Google's parent company, Alphabet, has recently talked about her experiences with Campbell in an episode of the Póstcast in Good Company.

""He was always a advisor who was at our disposal on the campus and, simply, it was the wise voice that always spoke clearly and bluntly,"" says Porrat. ""When something made no sense, I tended to bring out the best of each one.""

So great was Campbell's influence on Schmidt, from Google, that he, along with Jonathan Rosenberg and Alan Eagle, nicknamed the billion coach of dollars in a book of the same name. It included testimonies of a lot of executives who benefited from the coach's teachings, including the current head of Google, SUCBLE Pichai.

This is what some of them learned from Campbell.

Worry about ""all your self""

According to Schmidt and his co -authors, when Porat first assumed his former position as Financial Director of Google, he also had to make a great displacement to be able to work there. Remember that Campbell worried her most was how her husband would affect change.

""He worried about everything that personally affected you,"" says Porrat. ""We talked a lot about that.""

Porrat states that Campbell knew how to reinforce his students' convictions, which helped her carry out ""any task of enormous proportions"" that he had ahead.

""It allowed me to move on,"" he says. ""To have confidence in my good judgment.""

For Pichai, who also benefited from the most holistic approach to Campbell coaching, his conversations gave him the opportunity to get out of his busy daily routine.

""He was always very busy to meetings, with many things to do, but the time that happened with Bill always gave me some perspective,"" says Pichai. ""Anything I was doing was important, but he taught me that what really matters at the end of the day is how you live your life and the people with whom you share it.""

Choose your team well

Campbell also provided its pupils for a lot of more practical management tips.

""When I became Google's CEO, Bill advised me that, at that level, more than ever, we must bet on people,"" Pichai confesses, according to the book. ""Choose your team. Focus much more on that.""

Scott Cook - the co -founder of Intuit - was also a direct witness of the Campbell approach oriented to the people.

""I appreciated that each person had a different story and background,"" says Cook in Trillion Dollar Coach.

""It was different in the way of focusing the growth challenges and leadership challenges. I was looking for a way to grow our people in a way that I could not. Bill was great in that,"" he says.

Gives priority to honesty

According to Cook, Campbell's commitment to transparency influenced his own leadership style.

""A coach trains at the time,"" says Cook. ""It is more real and more authentic, but many leaders refuse it.""

https://businessinsider.com,The SMI will not pay IRPF in 2025: everything you should know about the agreement between the Treasury and Labor,https://www.businessinsider.es/empleo/smi-no-tributara-irpf-2025-todo-debes-saber-acuerdo-hacienda-trabajo-1451511,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 19:30:06 GMT","In extremis. A few hours after the deadline to do so, work and the Treasury arrived this Friday to compensate 20% of the SMI benefactors that this year must pay IRPF. The measure ends a tense debate between ministries, which had intensified in recent weeks.

The agreement consists in introducing a deduction in the income tax. This measure calms the spirits in relation to the dispute that faced the two main forces of the Government and prevents PSOE and add from being faced in Congress. During these days, the Minister of Finance, María Jesús Montoro threatened to veto the proposal of her minority partner, willing to ally with the PP to carry it forward.

On Friday morning, the second vice president of the Government and Minister of Labor, Yolanda Díaz, had broken the negotiations. ""Yesterday at 10 at night it was negotiating, so that citizens understand it, but she [Montero] has risen from that table, that is, she has given the instruction to break the negotiations,"" said the head of work in an interview in Telecinco.

Hours later, both ministries confirmed the existence of an agreement.

What is the agreement

The key to the agreement is to compensate for the SMI beneficiaries that this year would have to make the income statement. According to the Treasury calculations, the group of workers who charge the minimum wage will have to deal with their obligations with the Tax Agency. Half a million of the 2.5 million workers who charge the SMI in Spain.

What has been agreed is a ""deduction in the quota"" that allows this 20% affected not to reduce their income by having to pay IRPF. While there are loose fringes, and they have barely transcended details, it is expected that such deduction is of a amount similar to the amount retained by the Treasury. Around 300 euros, from the increase of 700 euros per year, which entails the increase of the SMI in 2025 - 16,576 euros gross per year (1,184 in 14 payments) -.

Who will benefit

The compensatory measure will benefit 20% of the 2.4 million people who receive the SMI in Spain. That is, around 480,000 salaried workers.

What happens to the remaining 80%. Well, it will continue as until now. That is, without having to allocate part of the SMI to the Treasury. This is because due to other deductions related to their personal situation, they were exempt from taxing in 2025.

For example, a taxpayer with a partner and a child under 3 years of age who charges the SMI does not apply any retention. While this does not happen with the single taxpayer and without children who charge the minimum legal remuneration full -time. For this worker, between 40 and 51% of the SMI increase will go to pay taxes, which is now compensated with the agreement.

In this way it will be a ""personalized measure for each worker"", which will be applied at the same time the income statement is made, so that ""it is known what is the exact amount that has to be given so that the deduction annuls the payment that the worker has with respect to the rent,"" said the holder of the Treasury in statements to the media in Granada collected by Europa Press.

What will happen in 2026?

The idea of ​​the Treasury is that future increases in the minimum wage are disconnected from the debate on taxation. The position of the Ministry is that for the SMI to continue growing and is fair, a time must come when contributing to public coffers.

A vision that they do not share from work, and that led to the confrontation between both portfolios. The main argument of Díaz is that if the SMI begins to pay IRPF, it would not reach 60% of the middle salary in Spain, as the government agreed. The second vice president considers that there is a ""fiscal injustice"" because the type that applies to these workers from 16,500 euros per year (the SMI) is 43%.

At the moment, the measure that has led to calm the waters is limited to 2025. which indicates that it is a patch that simply moves the future debate. Asked in the sixth about what will happen from 2026, Díaz maintains that the government agreement will be ""complied with"" according to which the SMI must reach 60% of the average net salary. A percentage that is not reached if IRPF is paid.

The toll from Myanmar's earthquake continued to rise on Sunday, as foreign rescue teams and aid rushed into the impoverished country, where hospitals were overwhelmed and some communities scrambled to mount rescue efforts with limited resources.

The 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar's strongest in a century, jolted the war-torn Southeast Asian nation on Friday, leaving around 1,700 people dead, 3,400 injured and over 300 missing as of Sunday, the military government said.

The junta chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, warned that the number of fatalities could go up and his administration faced a challenging situation, state media reported, three days after he made a rare call for international assistance.

India, China and Thailand are among Myanmar's neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.

""The destruction has been extensive, and humanitarian needs are growing by the hour,"" the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement.

""With temperatures rising and the monsoon season approaching in just weeks, there is an urgent need to stabilise affected communities before secondary crises emerge.""

The devastation has piled more misery on Myanmar, already in chaos from a civil war that grew out of a nationwide uprising after a 2021 military coup ousted the elected government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

Critical infrastructure - including bridges, highways, airports and railways - across the country of 55 million lie damaged, slowing humanitarian efforts while the conflict that has battered the economy, displaced over 3.5 million people and debilitated the health system rages on.

In some areas near the epicentre, residents told Reuters that government assistance was scarce, leaving people to fend for themselves.

""It is necessary to restore the transportation routes as soon as possible,"" Min Aung Hlaing told officials on Saturday, according to state media. ""It is necessary to fix the railways and also reopen the airports so that rescue operations would be more effective.""

https://cnbc.com,Nvidia turned CoreWeave into a major player in AI years before helping to save its IPO,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/coreweaves-7-year-journey-to-ipo-wound-through-crypto-before-ai.html,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","In this article CRWV Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

If not for Nvidia , there would be no CoreWeave IPO. The artificial intelligence infrastructure startup might still be plucking away in the crypto market. In 2020, CoreWeave established a business renting Nvidia's graphics processing units in the cloud. Now the company is generating $2 billion in annual revenue and just raised $1.5 billion in the biggest U.S. venture-backed tech IPO since 2021. But if not for Nvidia, once again, this week's IPO could have gone off the rails. After CoreWeave said it was going to sell shares at $47 to $55 a piece, investor demand failed to materialize due to a difficult public market environment and questions surrounding the sustainability of the company's business model. Nvidia, a major supplier and customer, stepped in to buy shares at $40 in a scaled-back offering. That's where the IPO priced on Thursday night and where the stock closed after its Nasdaq debut on Friday. ""I feel like this company has been built on a long list of events where the chips are down and the people at the top being tough as nails, but gets it through,"" Brian Venturo, CoreWeave's co-founder and chief strategy officer, told told CNBC in an interview on Friday. The IPO ""was just another one of those experiences."" Not that Venturo and his co-founders, CEO Michael Intrator and development chief Brannin McBee, are hurting. The three are worth a combined $5.3 billion on paper. And their company, along with its 250,000 Nvidia GPUs across 32 data centers, now has the attention of public investors as it challenges Amazon , Google , IBM , Microsoft and Oracle . Intrator says the company is focused on being best in class. ""We are built for speed,"" he said. ""That is all we do, right? And when you build something to do one thing, you end up with a Lamborghini, not a minivan.""

Intrator, 56, has an unconventional background for a technology CEO. He received a bachelor's degree in political science from the State University of New York at Binghamton and a master of public administration degree from Columbia University. After graduate school, Intrator spent about 16 years at carbon credit buyer Natsource, where he worked on sales of emission credits tied to air pollution. Venturo worked there as an energy trader. ""They were the Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen of the carbon markets at the time,"" said Alex Baldassano, who was a portfolio manager at Natsource. The Chicago Bulls teammates won six NBA championships in the 1990s. Intrator and Venturo went up against Goldman Sachs and won. Their firm was involved in the first over-the-counter trade in a cap-and-trade program called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, Baldassano said. They were pioneers in carbon trading years before the wider market began targeting net-zero emissions, he said. In 2013, the pair helped start a small natural gas hedge fund, Hudson Ridge Asset Management.

'One GPU turned into hundreds'

Then came crypto. In 2017, as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were rising in price, Intrator and Venturo joined with McBee to establish Atlantic Crypto Corp., which focused on ethereum mining with Nvidia GPUs. They chose ethereum because it didn't require specialized hardware, Venturo said on a podcast in 2020. Their ethereum effort first consisted of one GPU on a pool table in a Wall Street office. Soon the pool table was covered with GPUs. The trio later turned Venturo's grandfather's garage in New Jersey into a data center. ""One GPU turned into hundreds, then tens of thousands via strategic acquisitions of distressed hardware during the 'crypto-winter' of 2018/2019, and our portfolio of facilities grew to seven,"" Intrator wrote in a 2021 blog post. Intrator worked with employees to set up GPU servers, former engineer John Lynch recalled. In 2019, the company changed its name to CoreWeave and pursued additional computing jobs that could be handled with GPUs beyond crypto. That included rendering videos and training AI models. CoreWeave was suddenly competing with some of the world's largest technology companies, including Amazon , which has offered GPUs through the cloud for a decade. ""We quickly started getting inundated with introductions to businesses dependent upon GPU acceleration with a common pain point: legacy cloud providers make it extremely difficult to scale because they offer a limited variety of compute options at monopolistic prices,"" Intrator wrote on the blog. CoreWeave claimed on its website that it charged 80% less than traditional cloud providers.

Andrew Bly was CEO of visual effects studio Molecule VFX at the time. The New York company paid CoreWeave to run computing clusters and workstations after initially using Amazon Web Services. The result was faster rendering, he said, but some employees were having issues on the West Coast, where CoreWeave didn't have data centers. ""The leadership at CoreWeave was like, 'Give us less than a month,'"" Bly said, assuming that timeframe was impossible. But CoreWeave set up infrastructure in Nevada in under one month that made the cloud-based software easy for the West Coast employees to use, he said. CoreWeave was still generating revenue from ethereum mining, but only when the GPUs weren't being used for other purposes, Venturo said on the podcast. The idea was to achieve 100% utilization of the GPUs, in order to make the most of the infrastructure. The unit eventually shut down in September 2022. Two months later, an earthquake shook the computing world when OpenAI launched ChatGPT. Consumers were enamored with the chatbot. It grew to 100 million users in under three months, putting a strain on Microsoft, whose Azure cloud was responsible for providing computing resources to OpenAI. That's when Microsoft agreed to start renting GPUs through CoreWeave, ultimately signing a deal worth potentially billions of dollars.

Big revenue, big debt

It was a coup for a company that was, to that point, reliant on testimonials from small startups. ""That's the moment where CoreWeave came into the collective consciousness,"" said Michael Kellner, a communications executive who represented the startup at public relations agency Treble. Around that same time, Nvidia became a customer and invested in CoreWeave. The two companies enjoy a symbiotic relationship, Intrator said. ""They depend upon us to be able to build and deliver the most performant configuration of their infrastructure in the world,"" he said. ""They depend upon us to build it faster than anyone else. They depend upon us to find the issues within the software, within the hardware, so that we can troubleshoot it, so that it can be deployed globally."" But CoreWeave really depends on Nvidia. In the risk factors section of its prospectus, CoreWeave said ""all of the GPUs used in our infrastructure today"" are from Nvidia. Intrator said he stays in touch with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. ""I'm not bashful about reaching out to him,"" Intrator said. ""He's not bashful about reaching out to me. We're working on different pieces of similar problems, and so there's a free flow of information in order to optimize outcomes."" One challenge for public market investors is in figuring out how they should value CoreWeave. It's not a pure technology play with a popular gadget or application. Rather, it's cobbling together another vendor's technology, so that other companies can run their software on it. It's an expensive model that's required substantial financing. In 2023, CoreWeave raised $2.3 billion in debt led by private equity firm Blackstone and hedge fund Magnetar, now the company's biggest equity investor. It was an unconventional arrangement. CoreWeave posted the underlying Nvidia GPUs as collateral. In its prospectus, CoreWeave says it pioneered new and ""innovative"" methods of financing. But t came at a high price, with an actual interest rate above 14%. CoreWeave obtained over $7 billion in additional debt last year from Blackstone, Magnetar and others, borrowing at a rate of about 11%. ""As we have scaled, we have managed to drive lower cost of capital across our financings,"" the company said in its prospectus. For CoreWeave, it's the cost of playing in a market that's lifted Nvidia to a multitrillion-dollar market cap and, according to many experts, is still in its early days. Analysts at DA Davidson predict that CoreWeave accounts for 6% to 7% of Nvidia's revenue, and the company earlier this month signed a five-year deal with OpenAI valued at nearly $12 billion. ""CoreWeave has helped us build really large-scale computing clusters that led to the creation of some of the models that we're best known for, and helped us deliver these systems to customers at the scale that they need,"" Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, said in a recording that CoreWeave included in its IPO roadshow. With the OpenAI deal, Microsoft will represent less than half of expected future committed contract revenue, CoreWeave said, down from 62% of total sales last year. Baldassano, who now works in commodities trading, saw the headlines about CoreWeave's debt and other concerns while on vacation in Boston this week. Still, when asked if he plans to buy stock in the company, he didn't hesitate. ""Of course I am,"" he said. WATCH: Magnetar Capital's David Snyderman breaks down CoreWeave investment and IPO",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,Trump says he’s ‘very angry’ and ‘pissed off’ at Putin during an NBC News interview,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/trump-very-angry-and-pissed-off-at-vladimir-putin.html,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","U.S. President Donald Trump walks before departing for Florida from the South Lawn at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 28, 2025.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said he was ""very angry"" and ""pissed off"" when Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized the credibility of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's leadership, adding that the comments were ""not going in the right location.""

Agence France-Presse reported that Putin on Friday called for a transitional government to be put in place in Ukraine, which could effectively push out Zelenskyy.

""If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault — which it might not be — but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,"" Trump said in an early-morning phone call with NBC News on Sunday.

""That would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can't do business in the United States,"" Trump said. ""There will be a 25% tariff on all oil, a 25- to 50-point tariff on all oil.""

The president's comments come after he had previously criticized Zelenskyy, saying he was ""sick"" of his handling of the war and falsely calling him a dictator.

Trump had made ending the war in Ukraine a top foreign policy promise on the campaign trail, leading to meetings between U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials in the first few months of his second term. Last week, Russia and Ukraine agreed on a partial and limited ceasefire that would allow safe navigation in the Black Sea and halt attacks on each other's energy facilities.

""There will be a 25% tariff on oil and other products sold in the United States, secondary tariffs,"" Trump said, noting that the tariffs on Russia would come within a month without a ceasefire deal. Trump said Putin knows he is angry, but noted that he has ""a very good relationship with him"" and ""the anger dissipates quickly ... if he does the right thing.""

The two men plan to speak again this week, Trump said.

His latest comments came after a separate phone interview with NBC News on Saturday evening.

During the interview, Trump also threatened ""bombing"" and ""secondary tariffs"" on Iran if the country did not make a deal with the U.S. to ensure it did not develop a nuclear weapon.

""If they don't make a deal,"" Trump said about Iran, ""there will be bombing. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.""

U.S. and Iranian officials are ""talking,"" Trump said.

However, in a statement on Sunday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he rejected direct negotiations with the U.S. over its nuclear program, in the country's first response to a letter sent by Trump to the Islamic Republic's supreme leader.",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,"In Trump era, companies are rebranding DEI efforts, not giving up",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/in-trump-era-companies-are-rebranding-dei-efforts-not-giving-up.html,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, attends the inauguration of a new hub in France dedicated to the artificial intelligence sector, at the Google France headquarters in Paris, France, on Feb. 15, 2024. Gonzalo Fuentes | Reuters

After Google scrapped its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, hiring aspirations in February, CEO Sundar Pichai addressed the matter with his employees at a company all-hands meeting. ""We believe in building a representative workforce,"" Pichai said, according to audio obtained by CNBC. ""We're a global company, we have users around the world, and we think the best way to serve them well is by having a workforce that represents that diversity, and we'll continue to do that."" ""At the same time, as a company we will always have to comply with local laws,"" Pichai added. Among the most notable changes by Google thus far was with Melonie Parker, the company's chief diversity officer. As of February, her title has been changed to vice president of Googler engagement. Google's approach to DEI is emblematic of changes that companies across the U.S. are making to their DEI programs in the wake of President Donald Trump's election and initial actions in his return to the White House. Over the past decade, Silicon Valley and other industries used DEI programs to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and advance the careers of women and people of color – demographics that have historically been overlooked. While DEI started as an umbrella acronym to even the playing field, it's become a loaded term. In 2023, the Supreme Court ruled against Harvard University's affirmative action admission policies – a decision that had implications for how corporations hire. In one of his first acts of his second term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in January to end the government's DEI programs and put federal officials overseeing those initiatives on leave. The order directs ""all departments and agencies to take strong action to end private sector DEI discrimination, including civil compliance investigations."" The administration has targeted nearly 50 companies that it's deemed to be in violation of its anti-DEI rules, Bloomberg reported in February. Among the first of those targets is the Walt Disney Company . The Federal Communications Commission informed the company on Friday that it will begin an investigation into the DEI efforts at the media giant. Trump has shown he's willing to fault DEI policies for human tragedy. Following a midair collision between an American Airlines regional jet and a Black Hawk military helicopter above Washington in January, Trump blasted the Biden administration's DEI policies for the crash without citing any evidence. Trump claimed DEI ""could have been"" to blame for the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001. ""When you have the president blaming DEI for a plane crash, I think it makes sense that companies don't want to be out there no matter how they define it internally,"" Emerson said. Despite DEI becoming such a divisive term, companies are not necessarily ending their efforts. They're rebranding them. Many companies are continuing DEI work but using different language or rolling it under less charged terminology, like ""learning"" or ""hiring.""

DEI by any other name

Joelle Emerson has worked since 2014 as a consultant for several hundred clients on workplace performance as well as diversity and inclusion strategies, but last year, she changed the language used to describe her digital platform Paradigm. Whereas before Paradigm marketed itself as helping clients ""harness the power of diversity and inclusion to create a culture where everyone can do their best work and thrive,"" the company's website now states that its solutions ""create an inclusive, high-performance culture where everyone can do their best work and thrive."" Paradigm began using DEI in 2020 after the term proliferated in the corporate response to protests across the country in the wake of George Floyd's death. ""We started using that a lot on our websites so that companies searching for 'DEI' could find us,"" Emerson told CNBC. ""Pre-election, as we were seeing a lot of the backlash, we reduced our use of the acronym because I didn't think it would be the best description of what we do."" Devika Brij, who does similar work through her Brij The Gap consulting firm, detailed her efforts to distinguish her work in a newsletter sent out in February titled ""Tailored Career and Leadership Development Isn't DEI."" For companies like Brij's, the re-branding is critical to the future of their business – some of Brij's clients have slashed their DEI budgets by as much as 90% since 2023, she said at the time. It's not just consulting firms that are rebranding DEI. JPMorgan in March announced that it will replace ""equity"" with ""opportunity"" in a rebrand of its DEI program. Walmart in November said it was shifting from DEI to saying ""Walmart for everyone."" Among Fortune 100 companies, there was a 22% decrease in the use of terms like ""DEI"" and ""diversity"" and a 59% increase in terms like ""belonging"" between 2023 and 2024, according to Paradigm.

Emerson said 2023 marked the turning point for DEI in Silicon Valley. That's when Google began getting rid of staffers who were in charge of recruiting people from underrepresented groups, CNBC reported. The company also let go of DEI leaders under Parker. Amazon also reorganized its DEI group in 2023 and brought global teams under one umbrella named ""Inclusive Experiences & Technology."" The company renamed the group to better represent the nature of the work, a company spokesperson told CNBC, adding that Amazon remains committed to building a diverse and inclusive company. As part of that overhaul, Amazon's Candi Castleberry changed her vice president title from ""VP of Global Diversity Equity and Inclusion"" to ""VP of Inclusive Experiences & Technology."" Tech's DEI rollback has accelerated in 2025. Google, which has cloud-computing contracts with federal agencies, announced in February that it would retire its aspirational hiring targets following Trump's executive orders. Google's commitments for 2025 had included increasing the number of people from underrepresented groups in leadership by 30% and more than doubling the number of Black workers at non-senior levels. ""Our values are enduring, but we have to comply with legal directions depending on how they evolve,"" Pichai told staffers at the February all-hands meeting. He and Parker were answering a question from staffers about how the company's DEI programs would be impacted given Trump's recent executive orders. ""As a federal contractor, we have been reviewing all our programs, all our initiatives,"" Parker said. ""With regards to training, we're going to deprecate, or stop or sunset, a number of our training programs that are focused on DEI."" A spokesperson for Google did not clarify which of the company's DEI programs have been cut. Pichai went on to assure workers that Google would continue to support its employee resource groups. Those are employee-led networks within the company that focus on specific demographic or affinity groups, such as ""Women@Google"" and ""Black Googler Network."" Those comments, however, came before the Equality Employment Opportunity Commission published guidance in March that listed ERGs as a potential violation of Trump's executive order if they are exclusionary. Google's ERGs are open to all employees and do not exclude any protected groups, the company spokesperson told CNBC. ""Based on the current legal climate, we're reviewing our DEI programs and making changes where needed,"" the Google spokesperson said in a statement.

The sensitivity of the term DEI came to the forefront earlier this month at Austin's annual South by Southwest conference. There, Google and Oracle had been slated to participate in a panel, originally titled ""Successful Workplaces: Balancing Growth and Well-Being."" ""Attendees will leave with actionable insights to align business success with a thriving workplace culture,"" an early description of the panel noted. Oracle dropped out from the panel in February. That month, panel organizers informed participating companies that they were considering changing the focus of the conversation to the state of DEI in the workplace. ""The fact that the Trump administration took such an aggressive approach to DEI just made obvious, in our view, how timely this discussion was,"" said panel organizer Luis Gramajo, founder of nonprofit Sunday Afternoon Foundation, which helped organize that particular SXSW panel. The Google panelist dropped out in March after the panel's name was officially changed to ""Post-DEI Workplace: Tech Companies Managing Through Turmoil."" ""We went through I don't know how many prep calls, we changed the title of this eight plus times, we lost people who were afraid to be on this panel,"" said Chelsea Toler, one of the SXSW panelists and a co-founder at Logictry, an Austin startup. Google was not informed of the change until late February, the company spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the panel's new topic was outside of the employee's role and experience. ""We had a couple different panelists back out because this conversation, which is so important, has become kind of nuclear at this point, which is wild,"" said Diana Ransom, Inc. Magazine executive editor and the panel's moderator, at the event. Gramajo said he doesn't begrudge any of the panelists or companies that pulled out of the panel. ""They are, as we all are, navigating an incredibly complex and uncertain time, where the rules are not clear,"" he said.

Amazon has also pulled back on DEI. The company told staffers in December that it was halting some of its DEI programs as part of a broader review of those initiatives. It also eliminated references to inclusion and diversity in its annual report while altering a website to remove sections titled ""Equity for Black people"" and ""LGBTQ+ rights."" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy characterized the DEI eliminations as being part of Amazon's ongoing cost-cutting efforts. ""If you look at us, kind of like a lot of other companies, particularly after George Floyd, and particularly because we're so decentralized, we had a lot of programs in this area,"" Jassy told staffers earlier this month, according to audio obtained by CNBC. ""We had about 300 programs."" Amazon began evaluating its DEI programs ""a couple years ago,"" Jassy said. ""We realized there were several of them where we weren't getting enough value out of them for us to be investing in that way and those programs, we streamlined those,"" Jassy said. ""And in the programs where we were having a real impact, we doubled down."" It's unclear which programs Amazon cut and which it has expanded.

Continuing the work

""The acronym of DEI is completely unhelpful,"" said Aubrey Blanche-Serrallano, vice president of equitable operations at Culture Amp, a human resources platform. ""Diversity is incredibly valuable and important, but that specific acronym obscures a lot of what we're talking about."" For all the backlash toward DEI in Washington, recent studies show that this type of work remains popular among workers and companies. Pew Research in 2023 found that 86% of workers say they have a neutral-to-favorable opinion about increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. Paradigm, meanwhile, published a study last year which found that 73% of companies included diversity, equity and inclusion in their company values, on par with 2023. ""The feeling of the moment doesn't match a lot of the data I'm looking at,"" Blanche-Sarellano said. The experts that spoke with CNBC said they've yet to lose any clients as a result of the DEI backlash. To the contrary, they said they are optimistic that organizations will be forced to be more thoughtful about their plans and do away with ""performative"" aspects of DEI that did little to move the needle. Experts said one key example of performative actions were when companies signaled support for social media movements, like 2020's Blackout Tuesday, without any meaningful action to follow. Another example were companies that added chief diversity officers to their ranks without giving them formalized decision-making power or budgets. Among the changes happening now are companies shifting away from diversity reports, which tracked hiring based on different genders and ethnicities, and focusing instead on tracking the rates at which promotions and attrition happen, Emerson said. Companies are also changing how they have candidates apply for programs, Emerson said. With internships designed for specific ethnicities, for example, candidates might no longer simply check whether they are black or Hispanic but instead write an essay about their background, she said. Some experts are helping their clients calculate how much risk they may face by continuing DEI work under different names. ""There's a lot of legal gray area right now,"" Blanche-Sarellano said. ""At the end of the day, they want to focus on investing in their employees, not spend all their resources on a lawsuit.""

Economic and inflation uncertainty created by President Donald Trump 's tariffs — both implemented and threatened — are largely to blame. Cracks in the AI trade were also a factor, with the latest knock coming from CoreWeave 's scaled-down initial public offering that also priced below expectations at $40. Shares of the company, which rents Nvidia chips to customers for artificial intelligence workloads, opened at $39 in Friday's debut. The stock traded as high as $41.92 but closed unchanged at $40. CoreWeave was the biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021. Friday's ugly session — driven by a hotter-than-expected inflation reading and broad tech stock weakness — pushed the S & P 500 down 1.5% and Nasdaq down 2.6% for the entire week. The S & P 500 teetered on the edge of going back into correction territory, as measured by a decline of 10% or more from its most recent high. The Nasdaq dipped further into correction, now down almost 14.3% since its recent high. As of Friday's close, the S & P 500 slid nearly 6.3% in March, while the Nasdaq sank 8.1%. Both were tracking for their worst monthly performances since late 2022. Looking at the first quarter to date, the S & P 500 dropped 5.1% while the Nasdaq plunged 10.3%. Both are on pace to break their five-quarter winnings streaks and turn in their worst quarters since early 2022. There are no Club names reporting earnings this week — and it's going to be a quiet week for quarterly reports overall before we start hearing from the banks in the middle of April. However, developments on tariffs and a slew of jobs data are the two things to watch in the week ahead. 1. Tariffs : It's a big week: Wednesday, April 2, is the day Trump said reciprocal tariffs would go into effect. These are tariffs against U.S. trading partners that put levies on American imports coming into their countries. There has been some jockeying ahead of the deadline, with the president himself indicating last week there may be some room to negotiate. Bloomberg reported that the European Union is looking at concessions it could make to blunt Trump's planned reciprocal tariffs. Temporary exemptions on already-imposed Canada and Mexico tariffs, covering imports covered by the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), are also set to expire Wednesday. Last week, Trump announced 25% tariffs on autos and auto parts ""not made in the United States."" Those are due to go into effect Thursday, April 3. The Wall Street Journal reported that during a call earlier this month with top automaker CEOs, Trump warned them not to raise prices in response to tariffs. Responding to a question about that during an NBC News interview Saturday, the president said, ""I never said that. I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars."" Among the other tariffs that are already in effect include levies on imports from China as well as all foreign steel and aluminum imports. 2. Jobs, jobs, jobs : In addition to playing whack-a-mole on tariff headlines, investors will get a week of jobs data to ponder in the lead-up to Friday's release of the government's March employment report. On Tuesday, the Labor Department issues its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). Job openings for February, according to FactSet, are expected to have declined to 7.67 million from 7.74 million in January. The JOLTS numbers are reported on a lag — so, these February numbers are expected to only start to show the effects of the Trump administration's downsizing of the federal workforce as seen in February's weaker-than-expected nonfarm jobs growth. The ADP's private payrolls data on Wednesday, which doesn't count federal jobs, is still expected to reflect the overall malaise being felt in the economy. Economists, per FactSet, expect March job growth of 120,000 positions at U.S. companies. While greater than February's gains of 77,000, that would be well short of the upwardly revised 186,000 in January. The most current impact of the federal job cuts led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) advisory group will be seen in the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Friday. According to Factset, economists expect March nonfarm payrolls growth of 122,500, short of February's 151,000. The nation's unemployment rate for March is expected to show a slight increase to 4.2%, while wages are seen rising 4% year over year, matching February's gain.

https://cnbc.com,Los Angeles turned a profit on its last Olympics. The 2028 Games could come up short,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/la-olympics-2028-summer-games-cost-budget.html,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Micah Maʻa, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Janet Evans, Chief Athlete Officer, LA28, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, Delaney Schnell, and LA28 Chairperson and President Casey Wasserman appear as the Olympic Flag arrives to LA on August 12, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. Emma Mcintyre | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images

Los Angeles pulled off a rare feat in 1984: the city turned a profit on the Summer Olympics. It's looking like that may not be easy in 2028. And that could come at a bad time for the city. ""The city of L.A., financially, we are in trouble,"" Controller Kenneth Mejia wrote in a recent letter to Mayor Karen Bass and the City Council. Less revenue and higher spending adds up to a projected $140 million shortfall for the current fiscal year, and an additional decrease of $73 million next year. Los Angeles is ""overspending"" by $300 million, Meija wrote. A top city budget official recently estimated that the budget shortfall could reach $1 billion in its next fiscal year. Last week, state lawmakers requested another $1.9 billion in funding, after receiving $2.5 billion, to help with the city's recovery efforts from the January wildfires. LA28, the private, non-profit company organizing the 2028 Games, has a $6.9 billion budget funded by corporate sponsorships, licensing agreements, and a significant contribution from the International Olympic Committee. The budget covers expenses like renting athletic arenas, personnel costs, as well as housing athletes. But if the Olympics budget math doesn't add up exactly as planned, taxpayers could be left paying part of the bill, and LA and its Olympics committee are aware of the risks of overrunning cost estimates. In 2019, LA28's budget was increased by $1.36 billion. If LA28's budget still doesn't prove to be enough, the City of Los Angeles will be responsible for the next $270 million in funding. After that, California's state government will be responsible for the next $270 million — with the next $270 million after that again becoming LA's financial burden.

Olympics' host cities have a long history of financial failure If recent history is any indicator, it is fair to worry that the 2028 Summer Olympic Games will go over budget. In the last 60 years of host cities, almost none have been profitable or stayed on budget. The 2000 Sydney Olympic Games in Australia ended up 90% over budget after spending over $5 billion. The 2004 Athens Olympic Games ended up roughly 50% over budget, at $3 billion, due to overruns and growing debt. The 2016 Summer Olympic Games cost Rio de Janeiro a reported $20 billion. The Olympics have been so unprofitable that when London broke even with the 2012 Summer Games, it was judged by some to be a success.

Miles Osgood, a professor at Stanford University and Olympics researcher, says LA's organizers, drawing on lessons from 1984, have made responsible budget plans that position the city at a financial advantage going into the Games, compared to other recent host cities. As in 1984, LA is planning to use sites and structures that already exist, which saves on costs related to new construction. Use of existing venues is expected to save over $150 million. But the over $200 million profit Los Angeles generated that last time it hosted the games in 1984 occurred amid circumstances much different than today. Specifically, the games are much larger in size. LA will host 36 Olympic sports in 2028, instead of 21. In 1984, there were 221 events and 6,829 athletes. In 2028, there will be 800 events with 15,000 athletes. The bigger numbers multiply related costs (e.g. security, transportation, staff, rooms at the Olympic Village) ""that mushroom out of those basic figures,"" Osgood said.

Even before the wildfires introduced an unexpected financial and infrastructure challenge for LA, the city was home to significant anti-Olympics sentiment. Osgood noted that Los Angeles is central to the ""NOlympics"" campaign, a movement concerned with, among other things, the housing crisis and the lack of local democracy in the Games' planning. It has sought to expose the bad deals that hosts always make when welcoming the Olympics, and the group has been vocal about the 2028 Games since the wildfires. Despite the criticism, LA is confident that the games will be judged a success. Paul Krekorian, president of the Los Angeles City Council, recently told the New York Times, ""I believe the 2028 Games will similarly benefit Los Angeles for generations to come.""

For many residents still picking up the pieces of life in the aftermath of home losses, the typical spirit associated with playing host to the Olympics may not capture their mood in the traditional proud way. ""In 2028, when entire neighborhoods may still be clearing the ashes, the Olympic Flame is not going to be a welcome symbol,"" Osgood said. ""You can easily imagine how LA's Olympic slogan, 'Follow the Sun,' will fare, as protestors make calls, instead, to follow the money,"" he added. The wildfires in mid-January displaced tens of thousands of California residents and over 18,000 structures were destroyed. It is estimated that the recent wildfires will cost roughly $40 billion in insured losses. From an infrastructure perspective, the wildfires should not be an issue. None of the 2028 Olympics venues set to host were damaged by the fires. UCLA, which has been set to serve as the Olympic Village housing athletes, emerged unscathed. Experts say that it is likely to still be the venue for many of the athletes attending the 2028 games. But Meija recently said that the city's fiscal stress could not come at a worse time given the wildfires. ""We've gone from record levels of General Fund reserves 18 months ago to the brink of needing to officially declare a 'fiscal emergency,'"" he said. ""This added stress on the budget comes on top of the growing responsibilities for preparing for the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2028.""

While wildfires are not an uncommon occurrence in California, the scale of the destruction to homes, business, and public infrastructure is considerably higher than the LA area usually experiences, according to Matthew Burbank, a University of Utah professor who has worked extensively on Olympics urban policy. It may take several years for Los Angeles to rebuild, but Burbank said he does not expect the wildfires to have a direct impact on Olympics' planning, or any funds currently earmarked for the Games to be redirected from the Olympics to wildfire relief. ""More likely, the city's approach to budgeting for cost overruns would be to hope that they do not occur, and if they do, then the city will then have to figure out how to pay those costs,"" he said.

""I'm actually hearing from a lot of my own patients that they can't remember the last time that they were this stressed and unable to see an end in sight,"" says Dr. Neha Chaudhary, a double board-certified child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist.

""The spike in Google searches for how to manage stress isn't just digital noise,"" she says. ""It's a population-level cry for help.""

Chaudhary, who is the chief medical officer of Modern Health, says contributing factors include the economy, the political climate, climate change and feeling ""bombarded by information with very little escape.""

People who feel overwhelmed by what's happening nationally and globally still have to handle the daily responsibilities in their personal lives. Even positive life changes, like having a baby, getting a promotion or planning a wedding, can take a toll.

But Chaudhary says there is one positive takeaway from this trend: ""The increase in searches today is also a sign that people might be more aware of their mental health, and are actively looking for ways to take control of it.""

When Maryland Governor Wes Moore was 8 years old, his mother told him she wanted to send him to military school to correct his behavior. Yet it wasn't until he was 13 that she finally did send him to a military school in Pennsylvania. He ran away five times in the first four days. ""That place ended up really helping me change my life,"" said Moore while speaking about retirement security at a BlackRock conference in Washington, D.C., on March 12. One obstacle — the tuition costs — prevented his mother from sending him sooner, he said.

Moore was able to attend the school thanks to help from his grandparents, who borrowed against the home they bought when they immigrated to the U.S., to help pay for the first year's tuition. ""They ended up sacrificing part of their American dream so I could achieve my own,"" Moore said. ""That's what housing helps provide,"" Moore said. ""It's not just shelter. It's security; it's an investment. It's a chance you can tap into something if an emergency happens. It's a chance that you now have an asset that you can hold onto, and you can pass off to future generations."" After retirement funds, housing generally represents the second-most-valuable asset people have, Moore said.

Some now less likely to own homes than in 1980

Yet achieving that homeownership status can feel unattainable to prospective first-time buyers in today's economy. Around 30% of young Maryland residents are thinking of leaving the state because of high housing costs, Moore said. Both renters and homeowners across the U.S. are struggling with high housing costs, according to a 2024 report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. The number of cost-burdened renters — meaning those who spend more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities — climbed to an all-time high in 2022. At the same time, millions of prospective homebuyers have been priced out by high home prices and interest rates. Many hopeful first-time home buyers may feel that it was easier for their parents and grandparents' generations to reach home ownership status. Research shows those feelings are justified.

Tax season is prime time for scams. How to protect yourself

How rent can make or break your credit Since 1980, median home prices have increased much faster than median household incomes, according to recent research from the Urban Institute. Across the country, today's 35- to 44-years olds — who are in their critical homebuying years — are less likely to be homeowners than in 1980, according to the research. For that age cohort, the homeownership rate has dropped by more than 10% compared to 45 years ago, the Urban Institute found. Because today's 35- to 44-year-olds are also forming households at a lower rate, that number is likely understated, according to the research.

Ultimately, that can have lasting impacts on their ability to build wealth, said Jun Zhu, a non-resident fellow at the Urban Institute's Housing Finance Policy Center. ""When you have a house, when the house appreciates, you're going to earn home equity,"" Zhu said. ""Earning home equity is actually a very important way to earn wealth."" Those 35- to 44-year-olds who are in lower income quartiles have seen the biggest declines in homeownership compared to their peers. That is driven in part by the fact that people who are married are more likely to be homeowners, while lower-income individuals are less likely to be married. Education is also a factor in widening the homeownership gap, according to the Urban Institute, as a smaller share of heads of households who have the lowest incomes are getting college degrees.

These days, as a senior recruiter with GrowthLoop, she's ""busier than ever"" helping the tech company grow its engineering and product departments. She could post an open role on a Thursday night and ""easily wake up to 400 applications on a Friday morning,"" just hours later, she tells CNBC Make It. ""People are definitely applying more, and I would say they are applying more aggressively,"" Nolan, 39, says. ""So when they see an open role, they're jumping on it."" As candidates stress about low hiring, mass layoffs and a potential recession, Nolan says she often has to console job seekers about the realities of the market. ""We are not in what I would consider to be a normal market,"" Nolan says. ""But of course, there are things we can do to put ourselves in the best possible light."" The following are four tried-and-true pieces of advice that work in a normal job market and, despite today's cut-throat landscape, can still help candidates stand out, Nolan says.

1. Make your resume outcomes-based

Recruiters often review hundreds of applications a day, so Nolan says it's crucial to get your point across quickly and effectively. ""I love to see actionable outcomes,"" she says. ""I love to see not just how long you worked somewhere and what your job title was, but really, what did you do? What are some projects you're proud of? What are some things that you initiated or took the lead on?"" What's more, she says her most recent new hires all show a strong skill set and experience match with the new job. If you can demonstrate on your resume that you've done the job you're applying to before, or that your experience directly translates to what the new job will be, make sure that's front and center.

2. Show off your personal branding on LinkedIn

Make sure your online professional presence makes a statement, Nolan says. Applicants stand out when they have ""any kind of personal branding, whether it's a portfolio, a website, anything that you are putting out there in the world that says, 'This is who I am.'"" Personalize your LinkedIn or other online website ""to showcase you to the best of your abilities."" Include an up-to-date photo to show you're a real person, Nolan adds, and follow companies you're interested in on LinkedIn. ""Engaging with their content, networking with employees — it can create visibility before you apply.""

3. Network for referrals

Connections matter, maybe now more than ever. ""A referral is always going to be your best way in,"" Nolan says. ""If you have a friend who works with a company, if you know a hiring manager, if you know anyone who can provide some sort of warm introduction, it is a pretty surefire way of getting at least a toe in the door, if not your entire foot.""

A referral is always going to be your best way in. Kathleen Nolan

The best thing to do is proactively build and nurture relationships before you ever need something. To that end, stay active on LinkedIn, attend industry events and check out alumni groups. Applicants who are connected to the organization through its people ""tend to get to interviews a bit faster,"" Nolan says.

4. Sharpen your interview skills

Landing an interview can feel like winning the lottery these days, so make it count. Go in confidently by practicing with a friend or family member. Record your mock interview and note any improvements you could make, asking yourself the following: Did I sound confident?

Was I rushing my answers?

Did I actually answer the questions that were asked?

Did I say the things that I wanted to hit on? ""The more confidence you have, the less nerves you'll have and the better you will perform,"" Nolan says. Your interview can also show off the soft skills that hiring managers are craving, Nolan says, including adaptability, communication, problem solving, emotional intelligence and strong teamwork skills.

Staying open to new possibilities can sometimes lead to incredible opportunities, and your next role may surprise you if you let it. Kathleen Nolan",cnbc
https://cnbc.com,"23andMe bankruptcy: With America's DNA put on sale, market panic gets a new twist",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/23andme-bankruptcy-selling-deleting-dna-genetic-testing.html,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","DNA testing has become a valuable tool for hobbyists and novice genealogists. For some, learning they are the 10th cousin of Paul Revere or the 15th great nephew four times removed of the last King of Prussia is worth the perceived risk of sharing a DNA sample. But what happens when the company harvesting the DNA goes bankrupt?

That was the question posed to millions of Americans last week when 23andMe, the company that popularized consumer genetic testing and had early backing from Google, filed for bankruptcy, leading to a wave of calls for Americans to delete their DNA from the company's database.

While it's not 100 percent clear if the ""delete your DNA"" calls were warranted, privacy experts are alarmed, and Americans who had taken the genetic test took the advice to heart.

According to data from online traffic analysis company Similarweb, on March 24, the day of the bankruptcy announcement, 23andMe received 1.5 million visits to its website, a 526% increase from one day prior. According to Similarweb, 376,000 visits were made to help pages specifically related to deleting data, and 30,000 were made to the customer care page for account closure. The next day, that figure rose to 1.7 million visits, and rraffic to the delete data help page about 480,000.

Margaret Hu, professor of law and director of the Digital Democracy Lab at William & Mary Law School, thinks Americans made the right move. ""This development is a disaster for data privacy,"" said Hu. In her view, the 23andMe bankruptcy should serve as a warning as to why the federal government needs strong data protection laws.

In some states, Hu noted, the government is taking an active role in counseling consumers. The California Attorney General's Office is urging Californians to delete their data and have 23andMe destroy saliva samples. But Hu says that is not enough, and such guidance should be provided to all U.S. citizens.

The potential national security implications of 23andMe's data falling into the wrong hands are not new. In fact, the Pentagon had previously warned military personnel that these DNA kits could pose a risk to national security.

Exposing DNA collected from consumers is not a new issue for 23andMe, either. In 2023, almost 7 million people who took the genetic test were already exposed in a major 23andMe data breach. The company signed an agreement that involved a $30 million settlement and a promise of three years' worth of security monitoring.

But Hu says the bankruptcy does make the company, and its data, especially vulnerable now.

Drug research and genetic testing data

One of the things notable about the consumer mindset in the early years of the popularization of genetic testing was that a majority of users opted into sharing their DNA for research purposes, as much as 80% in the years when 23andMe was growing rapidly. Then, as the market for consumer sale of the popular DNA test kits reached saturation sooner than many expected, 23andMe focused more on research and development partnerships with drug companies as a way to diversify its revenue.

Currently, when 23andMe sells genetic data to other research companies, most is used at an aggregate level, as part of millions of data points being analyzed as a whole. The company also strips out identifying data from the genetic data, and no registration information (like a name or email) is included. Data researchers do need, such as date of birth, is stored separately from genetic data, and shared with randomly assigned IDs.

Hu is among the experts concerned these practices could change under 23andMe or any new buyer. ""In a time of financial vulnerability, companies such as pharmaceutical companies might see an opportunity to exploit the research benefits of the genetic data,"" Hu said, adding that they might try to renegotiate prior contracts to extract more data from the company. ""Will the next company that buys 23andMe do that?,"" Hu said of its privacy policies.

In recent days, 23andMe has said it will try to find a buyer who shares its privacy values.

Chinese consumers have been reluctant to spend since the Covid-19 pandemic. Retail sales rose by just 3.5% last year , less than half the average of 9.7% in the years 2015 to 2019. But on March 26, JPMorgan's China equity strategists upgraded consumer discretionary stocks to overweight from neutral. While tariffs and tensions with the U.S. may dent sentiment, the strategists expect Beijing may ramp up consumer stimulus following high-level policy calls to do so. In the meantime, ""our analytics show that China's business cycle for consumption has been bottoming out,"" JPMorgan's chief Asia and China equity strategist Wendy Liu and a team said in the report. They pointed out drivers such as recent trade-in policies, stabilizing stock and property prices , and moderating deflationary pressure due to base effects. The latest earnings results from Chinese companies signal some recovery in consumer spending , albeit still far from pre-pandemic levels except in some niche categories such as gold and popular toys. The JPMorgan analysts expect that in coming weeks, Chinese stocks may rise on better-than-expected earnings growth and increased forecasts. Their China consumer stock picks focus on sub-sectors with fundamental improvements and reasonable valuations. Here are their China consumer plays: Anta Sports — The Hong Kong-listed sportswear brand reported better-than-expected retail sales in February with less of a need for discounting products, according to JPMorgan. Anta owns the rights to Italian brand Fila in China. Mengniu — JPMorgan expects the Hong Kong-listed Chinese dairy giant can likely benefit from China's efforts to boost the birth rate. Mengniu is headquartered in the Inner Mongolian capital of Hohhot that this month announced subsidies of up to 100,000 yuan per child . However, the company reported a 10.1% drop in 2024 revenue in the face of ""intensified pricing competition,"" according to an annual report released Wednesday. China Resources Beer — The Hong Kong-listed seller of Heineken in China earlier this month reported sales of the premium beer grew by nearly 20% in 2024 despite a high base the prior year. JPMorgan noted that CR Beer's management reported a pickup in consumer sentiment in the first two months of 2025 and were confident of delivering stronger earnings growth in the year ahead than in 2024. Tal Education — The U.S.-listed Chinese education company currently operates at a loss, but its margins are set to improve as Tal sells significantly more artificial intelligence-powered educational devices in the next two years, JPMorgan predicts. The company said in January that its AI learning devices are one of its ""faster-growing business lines."" The JPMorgan report cautioned that although an official measure of consumer confidence has stabilized after plunging in 2022, it still remains about 30 points below where it was in the 2018 to 2021 period. China's retail sales rose by 4% in the January-February period versus a year earlier, raising hopes for an improvement in the year ahead. Chinese stocks have pulled back, with the Hang Seng index down more than 1% in the past week as a potential new round of U.S. tariffs loom in early April. However, in the last several days, major investment firms such as Goldman Sachs have noted that investors' interest in Chinese stocks has reached the highest since a peak in early 2021. JPMorgan last week raised their targets on the MSCI China index to a base case of 80 Hong Kong dollars, up from 67 HKD, for upside of around 6% from Friday's levels. The index tracks major Chinese companies traded on the mainland, in Hong Kong and the U.S. The strategists upgraded their view on China health-care stocks to overweight from neutral, given optimism over how AI may help biotech companies cut costs. But the firm downgraded Chinese industrial stocks to neutral from overweight due to overcapacity concerns and soft property-related construction demand. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",cnbc

The 30-stock Dow has tumbled more than 2% in the first quarter. Chip giant Nvidia has led the decline with its 18% fall, followed by losses from Nike and Apple of more than 16% and roughly 13%, respectively. The broader market has sold off in recent weeks due to increasing concerns that President Donald Trump's tariffs on major U.S. trading partners could weaken economic growth and place upward pressure on inflation. With this backdrop in mind, CNBC Pro screened for Dow stocks that analysts are feeling most bullish about. The stocks in the screener all met the following criteria: Have buy ratings from at least 55% of analysts covering the stock Could see upside of 20% or more to the average price target Take a look at the list and where analysts see them heading next. Despite Nvidia's sharp sell-off at the start of the year, analysts think the stock has rebound potential. Nearly 80% of those covering the stock rate it a buy, and the average price target implies shares gaining about 53% from their current levels, according to FactSet. Earlier in the week, Bank of America said the recent pullback presents a prime buying point for those looking to gain exposure to the artificial intelligence giant. ″[W]e believe the stock is providing a particularly attractive opportunity for one of the most unique, high-quality tech franchises leading the largest and fastest growing secular trends,"" analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note. Microsoft is another megacap tech name analysts foresee climbing in the second quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet estimate the stock gaining nearly 30% from current levels, with the majority also holding a buy rating on shares. Jefferies recently reiterated the stock as one of its favorite names to hold, adding that the ""recent weakness has created attractive risk/reward."" The firm also forecast Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform, to continue gaining market share versus its competitor Amazon Web Services. Shares are down more than 10% in the first quarter. Entertainment and theme park company Disney also made the cut. More than half the analysts who watch the stock rate it a buy and see shares advancing about 26% from current levels, per FactSet data. Disney shares have come under pressure after the company reported streaming subscriber losses in its Disney+ division during its fiscal first-quarter earnings report. The company also guided toward another ""modest decline"" in subscribers for the current quarter. Nonetheless, Bank of America reiterated its conviction in the stock in a recent note.

The HBO series' large cast of characters includes three middle-aged women taking a trip to recapture the magic of their childhood bonds, only to discover that they don't have much in common anymore. They fight, gossip and damage their relationships while poolside at a luxury resort.

If you've ever traveled with a group, or even just one friend, you might already know that vacations can strain friendships. But your next trip with friends doesn't need to cause HBO-worthy drama. If you do some vetting beforehand, you can avoid damaging a valued relationship by identifying which friends you should — and shouldn't — travel with.

Here are three red flags that mean you and your friend might not travel well together.

1. You have different budgets

In 2023, Christie Tate took a trip from Chicago to San Francisco with a friend who had ""a lot more resources,"" she told CNBC Make It on March 26.

The friction started before the two even got to the Bay Area: Her friend decided to fly first class, while Tate opted for economy. Her friend also booked them a hotel that was out of budget for Tate, 51, author of the bestselling memoir ""BFF: A Memoir of Friendship Lost and Found.""

When their plane landed, the friends had their first of many conversations about money — a notoriously uncomfortable topic.

""I felt like she was shaming me for not spending more money,"" said Tate. ""The facts are, I don't have that kind of money.""

DON'T MISS: How to start a side hustle to earn extra money

Spending became a pain point for the entire trip, with the pair needing to discuss how much money each was willing to shell out on transit, meals, museum tickets and excursions.

Money chats need to go deeper than the overall cost of your trip, noted Elaine Glusac, author of The New York Times' Frugal Traveler column.

""Talk about how you'd like to allocate the budget across variables like dining and entertainment,"" Glusac said. ""If you both want to see a Broadway show, for example, and one wants premium seats and the other is OK in the back row, would you two be OK sitting apart?""

You should especially address topics that aren't usually agreed on beforehand, like dining budgets, she advised.

""If one wants a fancy dinner and the other wants street food, perhaps you can compromise and go your separate ways one evening,"" said Glusac. ""But if that is a nightly thing, it might not be the best fit for the two of you to travel together.""

2. You need different amounts of 'alone time'

Traveling with friends doesn't mean needing to spend every waking second in each other's company. If you need ample alone time but every activity on your itinerary includes everyone on the trip, you might not want to vacation with this particular group.

You can avoid potential fights by being open about your preferences upfront before the vacation starts.

""You can agree to do things at a different rate and meet up later for a meal, but you should both be content on your own, which you should hash out prior,"" Glusac said.

3. Your interests don't align

Tour guide Danielle Oteri has navigated dozens of group trips through southern Italy and New York. They're typically made up of the same archetypes, she says: the planner, the drinker, the one who is quietly boiling with resentment.

""There was a situation with a group of friends where somebody wanted to do everything and wanted to get as much information as possible, see every nook and cranny, and the other people on the group trip were like, 'I'm on vacation. Leave me alone,'"" she says.

Traveling with friends who are excited about different aspects of the destination than you are can be frustrating. Before committing to a trip, have honest conversations about why each of you wants to travel, and be sure your interests align.

You probably don't want to have to convince someone that a museum or show is worth their time or money, just as you wouldn't want to be dragged out to something you have no interest in seeing.

https://cnbc.com,I've studied over 200 kids—parents who have the closest relationships with their adult kids do 7 things early on,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/psychologist-parents-who-have-close-bonds-with-their-adult-kids-do-7-things.html,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","Every parent hopes their child will grow up and still want a close relationship with them. But close bonds don't happen by accident — they are built through small, everyday interactions that make a child feel safe, seen and valued. As a conscious parenting researcher and coach, I've studied over 200 families. I've found that the way you respond to your children from the day they're born determines how strong your relationship with them is when they're adults. If you want your kids to always trust, respect and want to be around you, no matter how old they are, start doing these seven things early on.

1. Let them know their feelings matter

Children need to feel safe and comfortable sharing their feelings. But when they hear ""you're fine"" or ""it's not a big deal,"" they start believing that their feelings aren't important and eventually stop sharing them. Instead of dismissing emotions, acknowledge them. To help them feel heard, say things like: ""That sounds frustrating"" or ""I see you're upset."" Emotional safety isn't about fixing problems — it's about making sure they feel understood.

2. Choose connection over control

Parenting based on fear, punishment or constant correction creates distance. Kids will then learn to hide parts of themselves to avoid disappointing you. Parents who remain close with their children don't demand obedience. Instead, they prioritize building trust. Simple moments — laughing together, listening without judgment, showing empathy — help children feel safe. When kids feel emotionally secure, they continue seeking your support well into adulthood.

3. Give them a voice in their own life

When parents make all the decisions, kids start to think: My actions don't matter anyway, so why have an opinion on anything? DON'T MISS: How to start a side hustle to earn extra money Instead of deciding everything for them, ask ""What do you think?"" or ""What feels right to you?"" Let them make small, age-appropriate choices, like picking their clothes, hobbies or what to eat.

4. Own your mistakes

Parents expect respect from their kids, but they don't always model it themselves. Apologizing teaches kids that respect goes both ways. Saying, ""I overreacted earlier, and I'm sorry"" shows them that relationships aren't about power, but mutual understanding. Children raised in homes where accountability is the norm don't fear making mistakes. Instead of hiding their struggles, they trust they can come to you without shame.

5. Make quality time together a daily habit

A strong relationship isn't built in one big conversation — it's created through small, consistent moments. What shapes your bond isn't just the time you spend together, but how often your child feels prioritized. Sharing a meal, reading at bedtime or simply checking in about their day strengthens the bond. Kids who feel valued in small ways will naturally stay close to you later in life.

6. Let them be themselves without judgment

If a child feels constantly compared or judged, they start shrinking themselves to fit in. Over time, they learn to hide their real thoughts, interests and struggles. Helping kids accept themselves starts with how you respond to them. Instead of pointing out flaws, celebrate their uniqueness. Encouraging their interests, even when they don't align with your expectations, lets them know that you love them exactly as they are.

Daisy Hernandez has been a credit cards editor at The Points Guy since 2023, but has taken joy in gamifying credit card rewards for much longer. Like many of her colleagues, she spreads her spending across multiple cards to maximize rewards such as airline miles, hotel points and cash back. In January 2024, she opened a Chase Sapphire Reserve card and soon earned a 60,000-point bonus for spending at least $4,000 within the first three months. As she continued to rack up points, Hernandez began chatting with her mom about recreating a previous mother-daughter trip to Iceland. When her grandmother, then 79, got in on the conversation, Hernandez knew she wanted to put some points to use. ""She had stars in her eyes. She was like, 'That's amazing. It sounds incredible,'"" Hernandez says. ""I thought, 'Let me see what I can do.'"" By May, she'd accumulated more than 100,000 points, which she put toward a trip for all three of them. By The Points Guy's estimates, each Chase Ultimate Rewards point is worth roughly 2.05 cents, making her stash worth just over $2,000. Altogether, she was able to cover accommodations, a rental car and her own airfare. With those savings, she could afford to pay out-of-pocket for the other two flights. ""For my grandma, it was a once-in-a-lifetime trip,"" Hernandez says. Here's how she did it.

She chose a card strategically

Hernandez wanted a premium travel card and narrowed things down to two main options. To choose between them she looked at rewards points and transfer partners, among other factors. The Chase card worked with her ""favorite hotel chain,"" it turned out. So she realized, ""this is kind of a no-brainer."" Especially because the first card wooed consumers with airport lounge perks that wouldn't be available to her at her local airport. For cardholders willing to pay an annual fee, several travel cards offer excellent perks and generous introductory bonus offers. By shifting the bulk of her spending onto her new Chase card, Hernandez was able to eclipse the $4,000 three-month spending threshold to earn the card's 60,000-point bonus.

She was wise with her rewards

Hernandez's card offers a baseline one point for every dollar spent on the card and three points on travel and dining, plus increased values for purchases made through the Chase travel portal. Over the course of about five months, she was able to rack up just over 100,000 points. Importantly, Hernandez was responsible with her spending and aware of the risks of opening a new card. She and other experts would tell you not to open a card unless you can use it responsibly and to avoid going into debt to pursue rewards. Hernandez used some 23,000 points — about $470 by TPG's estimates — to rent a car for four days. She used around the same amount to book her flight, which came with a face value of roughly $450. She cashed in the remainder on three nights for three guests spread across two properties she booked through the Chase travel portal. Her 100,000 points didn't cover everything. She still paid roughly $900 for her mother and grandmother's flights, plus whatever she spent on dining and activities once she was there. ""I still got killer value out of a trip for three people,"" Hernandez says.

The U.S. operation of TikTok Shop launched in 2023, and has attracted 47 million shoppers to the platform, who spend on average $32 million every day, according to Capital One Shopping. The social media-based marketplace combines the ultra-cheap price points of Temu with in-app social shopping, similar to Instagram and Facebook.

It added an estimated 11.9 million U.S. buyers in 2024 alone, placing it ahead of competitors like Meta and Pinterest in the same period, according to Emarketer.

""All these companies should be real nervous because TikTok Shop starts from this huge strength of customer retention,"" said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, a marketing firm.

Unlike other social shopping experiences, TikTok Shop keeps buyers in its app. Others, like Instagram, take shoppers to external websites to complete purchases.

Additionally, TikTok uses its algorithm to suggest products the same way it recommends content – it shows users advertisements based on their engagement habits, not just shopping habits.

""Every time you look at something, every time you pause on something, every time you click or swipe on something, that's cutting code in the background on this algorithm and making it smarter,"" said Richard Crone, founder of Crone Consulting, an e-commerce firm.

Retail experts coin this marriage of shopping and entertainment as 'shoppertainment.' It's a category of e-commerce that has spawned entirely new careers for social media influencers like Lexi Rosenstein.



""People don't realize that you can have 5,000 followers and monetize your content on TikTok and TikTok Shop and make this a career,"" Rosenstein said.

As a TikTok affiliate, Rosenstein has amassed more than 70,000 followers and is the top U.S. seller for beauty products in the app. She attributes her large following to the growth of live shopping on TikTok.

And yet, TikTok Shop is at risk of disappearing.

Congress in April 2024 passed a law requiring China's ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to an American company or face an effective ban of the app stateside. The concerns are that TikTok is a national security threat due to its ties to China, accusations that TikTok denies. The app briefly went down for a few hours ahead of the law's initial deadline in January, but TikTok was given a 75-day extension by President Donald Trump through an executive order. ByteDance has until April 5 to find a U.S. buyer.



As of the writing of this article, no buyer has been announced.

Mike Blake | Reuters

President Donald Trump says Wednesday will be ""Liberation Day"" — a moment when he plans to roll out a set of tariffs that he promises will free the United States from foreign goods. The details of Trump's next round of import taxes are still sketchy. Most economic analyses say average U.S. families would have to absorb the cost of his tariffs in the form of higher prices and lower incomes. But an undeterred Trump is inviting CEOs to the White House to say they are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in new projects to avoid the import taxes. It is also possible that the tariffs are short-lived if Trump feels he can cut a deal after imposing them. ""I'm certainly open to it, if we can do something,"" Trump told reporters. ""We'll get something for it."" At stake are family budgets, America's prominence as the world's leading financial power and the structure of the global economy. Here's what you should know about the impending trade penalties:

What exactly does Trump plan to do?

He wants to announce import taxes, including ""reciprocal"" tariffs that would match the rates charged by other countries and account for other subsidies. Trump has talked about taxing the European Union, South Korea, Brazil and India, among other countries. As he announced 25% auto tariffs last week, he alleged that America has been ripped off because it imports more goods than it exports. ""This is the beginning of Liberation Day in America,"" Trump said. ""We're going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they've been taking over the years. They've taken so much out of our country, friend and foe. And, frankly, friend has been oftentimes much worse than foe."" In an interview Saturday with NBC News, Trump said it did not bother him if tariffs caused vehicle prices to rise because autos with more U.S. content could possibly be more competitively priced. ""I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars,"" Trump said. ""I couldn't care less because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they're going to buy American cars."" Trump has also suggested that he will be flexible with his tariffs, saying he will treat other nations better than they treated the United States. But he still has plenty of other taxes coming on imports. The Republican president plans to tax imported pharmaceutical drugs, copper and lumber. He has put forth a 25% tariff on any country that imports oil from Venezuela, even though the United States also does so. Imports from China are being charged an additional 20% tax because of its role in fentanyl production. Trump has imposed separate tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico for the stated reason of stopping drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Trump also expanded his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs to 25% on all imports. Some aides suggest the tariffs are tools for negotiation on trade and border security; others say the revenues will help reduce the federal budget deficit. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says they will force other nations to show Trump ""respect.""

What could tariffs do to the U.S. economy?

Nothing good, according to most economists. They say the tariffs would get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for autos, groceries, housing and other goods. Corporate profits could be lower and growth more sluggish. Trump maintains that more companies would open factories to avoid the taxes, though that process could take three years or more. Economist Art Laffer estimates the tariffs on autos, if fully implemented, could increase per vehicle costs by $4,711, though he said he views Trump as a smart and savvy negotiator. The investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the economy will grow this quarter at an annual rate of just 0.6%, down from a rate of 2.4% at the end of last year. Mayor Andrew Ginther of Columbus, Ohio, said on Friday that tariffs could increase the median cost of a home by $21,000, making affordability more of an obstacle because building materials would cost more. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told ""Fox News Sunday"" that the auto tariffs would raise $100 billion annually and the other tariffs would bring in about $600 million per year, or about $6 trillion over 10 years. As a share of the economy, that would be the largest tax increase since World War II, according to Jessica Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that tariffs would be a one-time price adjustment, rather than the start of an inflationary spiral. But Bessent's conclusion rests on tariffs being brief or contained, rather than leading other countries to retaliate with their own tariffs or seeping into other sectors of the economy. ""There is a chance tariffs on goods begin to filter through to the pricing of services,"" said Samuel Rines, a strategist at WisdomTree. ""Auto parts get move expensive, then auto repair gets more expensive, then auto insurance feels the pressure. While goods are the focus, tariffs could have a longer-term effect on inflation."" How are other nations thinking about the new tariffs? Most foreign leaders see the tariffs as destructive for the global economy, even if they are prepared to impose their own countermeasures. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Trump's tariff threats had ended the partnership between his country and the United States, even as the president on Friday talked about his phone call with Carney in relatively positive terms. Canada already has announced retaliatory tariffs. French President Emmanuel Macron said the tariffs were ""not coherent"" and would mean ""breaking value chains, creating inflation in the short term and destroying jobs. It's not good for the American economy, nor for the European, Canadian or Mexican economies."" Yet Macron said his nation would defend itself with the goal of dismantling the tariffs. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has avoided the tit-for-tat responses on tariffs, but she sees it as critical to defend jobs in her country. The Chinese government said Trump's tariffs would harm the global trading system and would not fix the economic challenges identified by Trump. ""There are no winners in trade wars or tariff wars, and no country's development and prosperity are achieved through imposing tariffs,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump did not rule out the possibility of seeking a third term in the White House, which is prohibited by the Constitution under the 22nd Amendment, saying in an exclusive interview with NBC News that there were methods for doing so and clarifying that he was ""not joking.""

""A lot of people want me to do it,"" Trump said in a Sunday-morning phone call with NBC News, referring to his allies. ""But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it's very early in the administration.""

""I'm focused on the current,"" Trump added, in some of his most extensive comments to date about serving a third term.

When asked whether he wanted another term, the president responded, ""I like working.""

""I'm not joking,"" Trump said, when asked to clarify. ""But I'm not — it is far too early to think about it.""

When asked whether he has been presented with plans to allow him to seek a third term, Trump said, ""There are methods which you could do it.""

NBC News asked about a possible scenario in which Vice President JD Vance would run for office and then pass the role to Trump. Trump responded that ""that's one"" method.

""But there are others too,"" Trump added.

Asked to share another method, Trump simply responded ""no.""

Amending the Constitution to abolish the two-term limit would be exceedingly difficult, requiring either a two-thirds vote of Congress or two-thirds of the states agreeing to call a constitutional convention to propose changes. Either route would then require ratification from three-quarters of the states.

The president pointed to his poll numbers, saying that ""a lot of people would like me to"" hold office for a third term.

Trump has previously commented on running for a third term in office, though Republicans have seen these comments as jokes or the president trolling his critics.

Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., crafted a resolution calling for the extension of presidential term limits, which would allow Trump to seek another term in office.

Meanwhile, Trump ally Steve Bannon said in an interview on News Nation that he believes Trump will ""run and win again in 2028."" Bannon said in the same interview that he thought ""we'll have a couple of alternatives"" in determining how Trump could seek a third term despite the two-term maximum for holding the presidency.

The White House has amplified Trump's comments likening himself to royalty, posting a picture of a fake magazine cover depicting the president with a crown after the administration shot down congestion pricing in New York City.

https://cnbc.com,Why JPMorgan and BlackRock want to 'privatize' more of your stock and bond money in market correction,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/30/wall-street-wants-privatize-stock-bond-money-market-correction.html,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 GMT","From America's largest bank to its biggest asset manager, Wall Street investment strategies once reserved for private banking clients are increasingly being offered to Main Street investors.

In the midst of a market correction and ongoing uncertainty about the outlook for U.S. stocks and the global economy, JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock are among major players in the ETF space making bets that private strategies will continue to see greater adoption. That includes private credit as a mainstream bond portfolio holding, as well as equity income strategies that involved more complicated trading than traditional dividend equity funds.

""Across our business we are looking at an incredible amount of demand from ETF investors who are looking for access to alternative investment funds, and we find managers are looking to push more into that wealth space to tap into growth to meet investors where they are,"" Ben Slavin, managing director and global head of BNY Mellon ETF business, told CNBC's Bob Pisani on last week's ""ETF Edge"" from the Exchange ETF Conference in Las Vegas.

""While mutual funds still make a ton of sense for retirement accounts, interval funds have been really successful in allowing for access to private credit,"" Jay Jacobs, head of BlackRock's US Thematic and Active ETF business, told Pisani from the conference. He was referring to a form of closed-end fund that has existed for a long time, and in which investors can access private credit, albeit with less liquidity than in an ETF.

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager and biggest issuer of ETFs, acquired a provider of alternative investments research last year, Preqin, and Jacobs said the firm plans ""more indexing of private investments.""

The SEC recently approved the first private credit ETF, though not without some controversy.

Lack of liquidity in private markets is a key issue for ETFs to solve as they attempt to grow the alternative investment side of the business. These kinds of funds, like Van Eck's BDC Income ETF — which invests in business development companies that make private loans to small and mid-sized companies — have traditionally been illiquid but because of innovation in the ETF industry, more people are gaining access.

Another trend that is catching on within the ETF market amid the current volatility in stocks is active ETFs designed to offer downside protection while capitalizing on income gained from selling call options. ETFs including the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) and JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) use this approach.

Goldman Sachs Asset Management's Bryon Lake said on a recent ""ETF Edge"" — he was among the leaders of the JPMorgan ETF business when JEPI was created and now runs a similar strategy at Goldman — ""You sell that call, you get the premium for that, and then you can pay that out as income. As we look at this space, that's one category that's been evergreen for investors. A lot of investors are looking for income on a consistent basis.""",cnbc
