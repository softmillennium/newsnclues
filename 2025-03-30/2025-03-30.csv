Historically, economic progress has been driven by seismic shifts in how we value things.

From the agrarian economies that once sustained early civilisations, to the industrial revolutions that mechanised production – each era reshaped society's priorities.

In the late twentieth century, the rise of the ‘knowledge economy', placed information and cognitive thinking at the heart of progress.

But today, as the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) accelerates, we find ourselves at another crossroad.

“The ‘knowledge' based economy is on its way out”, said Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, “and an innovation economy, is on its way in”.

For decades, the knowledge economy reigned supreme. It thrived on the ability to process, store, and distribute information. But since then, AI has fundamentally changed the game.

Machines can now analyse vast amounts of data, identify patterns or generate human-like text in the matter of seconds – tasks that once required years of expertise. Yet, as AI takes over knowledge-based work, information alone is no longer enough. 

It falls short in defining the problems worth solving, or imagining a future that does not yet exist.

In response, a new economy is taking shape – one built on human capabilities that AI cannot replicate.

The real breakthrough lies in understanding where AI's capabilities end, and when human strengths take over.

Human creativity has started taking precedent over the rote accumulation of knowledge, as the operative question pivots from ‘what is left for humans after AI?', to ‘what is possible when they work together?'

Business leaders have already recognised this shift. LinkedIn data revealed that 90 per cent of C-suite executives reportedly consider AI as a top priority, with businesses pouring billions into AI-driven automation and decision making.

According to Accenture, 73 per cent of companies are channeling their digital investments into AI, recognising its potential to boost productivity and unlock entirely new markets. 

Despite fears of AI replacing jobs, the reality is more nuanced.

By 2030, nearly 70 per cent of the jobs that will exist have yet to be invented. This presents a paradox where AI will replace certain tasks, but it will also create entirely new industries and career paths. 

What's more, the rapid advancements in AI from leading tech heavyweights are making automation cheaper than hiring employees. 

The AI market is projected to surpass $800bn (£618.19bn) in 2030, with AI agents handling a growing share of business functions.

Chinese startup DeepSeek proved to global tech players just how affordable AI-powered systems can be, launching an advanced chat bot at a fraction of the cost of similar, US developed models.

The real challenge, however, won't be job losses – or the idea of being ‘replaced'. Rather, it will be whether organisations or individuals are prepared to redefine their roles.

“We are moving from an era of humans supporting technology, to one where technology supports human potential”, added Raman.

As Jensen Huang, chief executive of chip giant, said: “You're not going to lose your jobs to AI, but rather to someone who uses it.”

In the UK, the anaemic growth of IT skills among Brits has widened the AI skills gap – meaning we don't have the level of expertise across the country to accommodate this shift. 

IT and AI positions were reportedly the hardest recruit for in 2025, with 43 per cent of business leaders considering hiring talent internationally instead. 

While leaning towards innovation promises a new frontier of economic growth, systemic barriers continue to hold back potential pioneers.

A sobering reality remains that economic privilege still plays a significant role in determining who can innovate successfully. 

Research from MIT reveals that children from high-income families are 10 times more likely to become inventors than their lower income peers. 

Economists have coined this phenomenon the “Lost Einsteins” problem – a term that encapsulates the vast potential squandered due to socio-economic disparities.

If the innovation economy is to thrive, businesses and policymakers must commit to breaking down those barriers, by prioritising diverse hiring and creating pathways for underrepresented talent to enter the workforce. 

Governments should rethink education systems to prepare students for a world where adaptability will be more important than memorising facts, or risk leaving millions behind in the AI boom. 

The conversation around AI has too often been framed in extremes – either as a dystopian, job-thieving technology, or an over-hyped trend with limited impact.

This is now giving way to a more balanced perspective, where fostering effective collaboration between humans and AI, will unlock human potential on an unprecedented scale.

Organisations should therefore develop roles that integrate this collaboration, which necessitates a cultural shift towards cross-functional approaches. 

People using AI will drive personalised learning and development, fostering a culture of continuous adaptability.

There will be drawbacks, like increased pressure on workers and ethical concerns, but ultimately, those who leverage AI will set themselves apart.

While AI might just be the most powerful tool of our time, at the end of the day, it is just that: a tool. It doesn't stand without human interaction.

							Features Journalist						


Erin Doherty rose to fame as the young Princess Anne in The Crown, but this year has found new success working alongside Stephen Graham on two projects, A Thousand Blows and Adolescence. She tells Adam Bloodworth how playing a child psychologist in the latter ‘consumed' her, the type of queer stories she'd like to tell over the coming years and how she's been bingeing The Crown long after she left the Netflix show

Erin Doherty had already captured the zeitgeist. Her performance as Princess Anne in The Crown had such subtle power that it made casting director Nina Gold realise working class people could play aristocrats. Then as crime lord Mary Carr in A Thousand Blows, she was lauded as one of the most versatile actors of her generation. Next came Adolescence, in which Doherty plays a child psychologist interviewing a teenager accused of murder, which blew everything else out of the water.

Doherty leads some of the most harrowing scenes in the mini series, which has garnered the biggest audience for any streaming TV show in the UK in a single week. It's become hard to pop to the shops without people asking “have you seen Adolescence?” – and everyone sounds genuinely unnerved. Asking questions about masculinity and online culture, it follows a 13-year-old boy, Jamie, who's been accused of murder. Shot as live, each episode is filmed in a single take, with actors allowed to improvise, making its form almost as interesting as its content. Owen Cooper, who plays Jamie, has already landed the role of young Heathcliff in a forthcoming film adaptation of Wuthering Heights. 

Doherty says she was genuinely scared during filming. You can't turn away from her interrogation, which controversially humanises a murder suspect, but also shows the mental health repercussions on the psychologist. 

We start by acknowledging that, by anyone's standards, it's been quite the year. “It took a good month to get it out of my system,” says Doherty of Adolescence. “You can't escape what it's doing to you, it kind of gets in your bones. There's no copy and paste formula like, ‘Okay, I'll do this, and then I'll be Erin again.' I was just so consumed and exhausted, just at the level of emotional intensity of this thing.'” Doherty is propelled by the show's themes about online radicalisation of young men. “I think we all have to hold ourselves accountable for trying to break the cycle in some way.”

Talking over Zoom, Doherty wears a luminescent blue jumper and an even brighter smile. Unlike her most famous roles which veer towards austere, she is cheery and incredibly gracious. The first thing she offers is motherly reassurance about the tech issues I've had logging onto our call. “It's so stressful, but you don't need that anymore – it's all gone!” She chats effusively about everything from how she hated school to bingeing The Crown and obsessing over her characters. If a PE teacher were to mark her interview style, they'd commend her for “giving 110 per cent.” 

Had it not been for Adolescence, her boxing drama A Thousand Blows, released this February on Disney Plus, would still be brewing in the public consciousness. Doherty's female crime lord was gently terrifying, with some hilarious lines, and that's without mentioning the game-changing representation: bad-ass Victorian female crime lords, based on women who actually existed, aren't your classic prime-time fodder. She spent a year filming that, then went straight into Adolescence, both with Stephen Graham, who invited her into the latter after being impressed by her work on the former: “I didn't even read the script,” she says. “Whatever he does is just full of pure heart and love and care. I just knew that it was gonna be so vital; he doesn't take on projects lightly.”

The show has become the first streaming show ever to top the UK's weekly TV ratings. “With something that is so frightening, it's so easy to avoid it and to just go, ‘What a horrible thing that some people can do, I can't get my head around it.' Whereas this show is going, I understand how frightening a prospect that is, but we have to hold ourselves accountable for shining a light and going, ‘How are these events happening?'” says Doherty.

“Especially with our younger generation, we deserve to humanise how they get there, because otherwise, again, they just become this kind of two dimensional evil ‘other'. And actually, I do believe that everyone is born a good person. I don't think that people are inherently evil. So it's always necessary, it's always worthy of our time to pick at that and go, ‘Oh my God, how did you get there?'”

Chuck in eight West End eight shows a week on top of her promotional schedule for Adolescence (she's currently starring in the play Unicorn) and despite how she clearly loves talking about the show, she admits she's “sooooo readyyyyyy” for a holiday. I suspect her ability to appear affable even when she's exhausted has helped her schmooze numerous big-wigs on her way up.

You wonder how our brightest Hollywood hope would fare on a sun lounger. Doherty admits she obsesses over people to a degree that isn't healthy. “It's my biggest thing that I battle with,” she says. “I think we've all got demons. For me, it manifests as overthinking. I'll get to the end of the day and I'll lie in bed and be like, ‘Oh God, I hope that person didn't take that the wrong way.'” She has to be careful that this approach doesn't wear her down, because she “grew up a people pleaser.” But her ability to over-analyse can yield positive results, working in favour of forthcoming projects. When she researches roles, “I'll dig and dig and dig and really try to understand and pick up why people behave the way they behave. I could linger on a specific interaction for a week.” 

I don't need to know what you think about my work. If you want to come up to me and talk about it, great, but I don't need to be a part of that conversation online

Growing up in Crawley, West Sussex, as a young girl Doherty and her older sister would take acting classes at the weekends. She was the shy one, but nevertheless remembers the experience changing her. “Something flipped through art,” she says. “I was like, ‘Oh, I don't have to be Erin anymore.' That was my first lasting impression of what acting and being someone else could do, mentally. I can put that anxiety down for a couple of hours and just let go. There's not been anything else that I've found so freeing. It's just in me. I don't know how I would function without this ability to just let go.”

She took a one-year course at the Guildford School of Acting in 2011, not long after leaving high school. Studying acting at the Bristol Old Vic, she graduated in 2015 and was first inspired to tread the boards after watching Mike Bartlett's Earthquakes in London at the National Theatre, a vivid, chaotic interpretative dance number about, amongst other things, climate change.

Call The Midwife and the BBC miniseries of Les Misérables were early roles, but the part that properly propelled her came in 2019 when she was cast as a young Princess Anne in The Crown. Casting director Nina Gold had thought “playing a whole different social class is one of the most difficult things to do convincingly”, but has admitted, “Erin really blew that theory.” She was captivating as the poised young princess, revealing a vividness to the most reluctantly camera-ready of the late Queen's children. She still binges The Crown, and is obsessed with Imelda Staunton. “I got to meet her the other day. We were working on an audio book, and she is everything you want her to be. I absolutely binged the last series and thought it was phenomenal.”

Looking back to where it all began, Doherty reminisces about studying musical theatre at her comprehensive school in Crawley. She still has family there, and pops back regularly, but as a whole she cannot wax lyrical about the institution. “I hated school with a passion,” she says. “But the drama department was so pivotal to me.” She'd love to go back and jump in on some lessons. “I have such admiration for teachers but I could never see myself having the skill and ability.” 

If not through teaching, she has always been keen to promote the idea of levelling up. Doherty seems genuinely overwhelmed when I read the Nina Gold quote to her. “For her to say something like that, I don't really know how to deal with that. I'm just grateful she took a chance, and I hope that it encourages other casting directors to keep doing that, because I think without them taking that leap of faith, so many actors wouldn't get their foot in the door. I think that an actor's job is to transform.” She's passionate about “bringing working class actors into the world of screen acting,” and has been inspired by Stephen Graham. “He's so brilliant at climbing the ladder, looking down and helping people up. That's so inspiring to me. If I could do what he did for me and is continuing to do for others, I'd be so overjoyed.” 

Away from work, Doherty is private, but decompresses by enjoying the small things. “Walks, family, engaging in normal conversation.” You sense she finds the concept of celebrity so bizarre that describing her downtime is a weird notion in itself. Despite whatever's been written about her (none of which she reads), success has forced her “to really, really lean into my people. I have a very small circle.” She is happily in a relationship, but contrary to newspaper headlines, her girlfriend “isn't in the industry”. 

You can see why Adolescence appealed. She admits she is “awful” at her phone, always leaving her family on read, and says too many of us are addicted to technology. “I don't think I'm doing it right either,” she says of her scarce digital approach. “I feel like there's got to be a better balance. I've just kind of gone the opposite end of the scale.” Of Gen Z, who are growing up internet natives, she has “such empathy.” “It just completely freaks me out. I don't know how I'd manage.”

She shies away from public perceptions about her, and is firm about why: “I just want people to watch the show. I don't necessarily need to know what you think about it. If you want to come up to me and we'll talk about it, great, but I don't need to be a part of that conversation online. That's not for me.” Instead, her family and set of lifelong friends are her barometer. “They'll be like, ‘Things are really positive for you. Just know that you're doing alright.' I don't need to look any further. If my people are telling me that it's all good, then that's enough.”

As for what's next, she's vague, but implies nothing's firmly on the table yet. She will reveal, though, that more queer storytelling is a priority. “I feel like that's going to be the route that I go down. Because, as I say, I'm so deeply passionate about telling queer stories and providing that representation. I hope that's something I'll get to pursue down the line. Breaking the kind of mould of it being a trope or like a cliche, being the queer friend, or the exploration of the relationships. They do exist, but it's really rare to find the nuance and the levels of detail of what it means to be queer.” She's inspired by “the way Steven collaborated with Jack Thorne on Adolescence. I'd love to maybe collaborate with a writer because I don't know if I've got the bravery to be like, ‘And now I'm going to write this thing.' I hold my hand up, I am definitely an actor.”

She circles back to that much needed holiday, then, on the topic of future roles, offers me a final one of her beautiful thought spirals. “I just like people,” she says. “Trying to figure out why we behave the way we behave, whether that means putting on a corset and walking down the cobbles of East End London or putting on an Adidas tracksuit and exploring what that means in 2025.”

Oops, something went wrong

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shares jumped this week after new comments from Trump administration officials and a board shake-up at the companies drew fresh attention to their potential release from government control.

But beyond the stock market, housing experts see plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the end of an arrangement that dates back to the depths of the financial crisis. The biggest one? Privatization will probably send mortgage rates higher.

“We can debate how much of a cost it will be,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. “That's a legitimate debate, but rates are going to go higher.”

The Trump administration is considering sweeping changes to a crucial piece of the US housing ecosystem at a time when affordability is near an all-time low and home sales are mired in a years-long slump. While Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac don't make mortgages, they play a crucial role in lending by buying up mortgages from banks and other lenders and packaging them into bonds. The system frees up money for more loans.

Investors' willingness to buy the bonds — mortgage bonds are a more than $10 trillion market — helps keep Fannie and Freddie's borrowing costs, and by association, 30-year mortgage rates, low.

Today, mortgage bonds are seen as a good bet by investors in part because Fannie and Freddie have the government's backing and share its top credit ratings. A major hurdle to privatization is how to preserve at least some of that backing. If investors perceive a private Fannie and Freddie as riskier, the companies will have to pay more to borrow, which would likely mean mortgage borrowers will pay more too.

Read more: What determines mortgage rates? It's complicated. 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that plans to release the two companies will hinge on mortgage rates. At around 6.7%, rates today are more than 1.5 percentage points higher than they were at any point during Trump's first term, and they're at similar levels to where they were before Fannie and Freddie entered conservatorship in 2008.

The power of a guarantee

The companies, known as government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), were chartered by the federal government but spent decades as private companies. In fall 2008, they were on the brink of failure when risky mortgages they bought up began going bad en masse. The Bush administration, fearing a complete collapse of the mortgage financing market, placed the two companies under its supervision and spent billions to bail them out.

That takeover is an example of Fannie and Freddie's “implicit guarantee” — the idea that the government wouldn't let such an important financial institution fail, even if it were private and no formal agreement about government support was in place.

When the two companies entered conservatorship, that implicit guarantee became effectively explicit.

The conservatorship arrangement was intended to be temporary. The idea of releasing the companies from government oversight has some bipartisan support, but it never became a reality across multiple presidential administrations because of concerns about mortgage market disruptions.

In the years since the financial crisis, Fannie and Freddie returned to profitability, paid back the government, and developed new methods to shift credit risk away from taxpayers. Meanwhile, the housing market recovered, and homeowner equity sits near record highs.

“Right now, everything seems to be working just fine,” said Eric Chan, a vice president in North American Financial Institution Ratings at DBRS Morningstar, a credit grader. Because Fannie and Freddie back more than half the mortgages in the country, even relatively small changes to their operations could have an outsized effect on the market, he added.

Most experts agree that Fannie and Freddie would need some sort of government guarantee when they go private to continue without disruption. Even a return to an implicit guarantee would likely raise mortgage rates, said Jim Parrott, a nonresident fellow at the Urban Institute and a former White House economic adviser during the Obama administration.

“The squirrely part about an implicit guarantee is that it's a perception-based phenomenon,” Parrott said. If any major market players, like top mortgage bond investors or ratings agencies, begin to question the government's commitment, it would create a “ripple effect that will flow through the market whether they're right or not,” he added.

Zandi, of Moody's, estimates that if Fannie and Freddie go private with an implicit guarantee, mortgage rates could rise between 20 and 40 basis points. From current levels, that would mean rates back at or near 7%.

A release with no guarantee whatsoever could send rates 1 to 1.5 percentage points higher. Few experts view that scenario as probable given the destabilizing effects on the housing market.

“Without a government guarantee, the GSEs have nothing,” Mario Ichaso, a mortgage-backed securities trading desk strategist at Wells Fargo, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. “And America would lose one of its primary engines that has generated trillions of wealth for its citizens through homeownership.”

There's one scenario that could result in lower rates: The government could formally back the companies before they're released, giving them an even more explicit level of support than the current system. But that backstop would require an act of Congress, which is politically unlikely.

Any release plan will take time to develop given the complexities and the money involved, said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, which has advocated for a conservatorship exit involving an explicit guarantee.

""This is such a big issue,"" Fratantoni said. ""The numbers are so big ... that this is going to take a lot of attention from the Treasury and particularly from the Treasury secretary.""

Oops, something went wrong

President Trump is reportedly pulling together a TikTok rescue that may not fully cut ties between the social media app and its Chinese parent company.

But such a deal may survive any legal challenges due to how the US law mandating such a separation was written — and the hold that Trump has over the GOP-controlled Congress.

""If you asked me to sort of predict or bet on the success of a legal challenge, my money would be on all of those challenges failing for lack of standing,"" said University of Houston Law Center's law professor Nikolas Guggenberger.

Congress last year passed a law requiring a ""qualified divestiture"" of TikTok, a reference to control of the company and the algorithm that powers the app. Its Chinese parent can retain no more than a 20% stake in the company.

What's important to remember is that the law allows the president to determine whether that “qualified divestiture” threshold has been met — giving Trump some leeway as he tries to pull a deal together before a renewed ban of the app takes effect on April 5.

In the deal currently being negotiated — according to reporting by Reuters and Politico and other media outlets — the biggest non-Chinese investors in ByteDance may increase their existing stakes and acquire the US operations of TikTok as part of a new entity. That would push Chinese ownership below a critical 20% threshold.

TikTok and its CEO, Shou Zi Chew, have repeatedly objected to letting go of the app's proprietary algorithm. The deal being contemplated, according to media reports, would task tech giant Oracle with safeguarding Americans' data on TikTok to ensure it is not available to China.

That may not go far enough to satisfy some who wanted to eliminate all Chinese involvement.

""The law is clear,"" Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.), chair of the House Select Committee on the CCP, wrote in the National Review. ""Any deal must eliminate Chinese influence and control over the app to safeguard our interests.""

TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, operates under Chinese Communist Party law, which requires it to share user data upon request.

US intelligence officials have expressed concern that the CCP could use Americans' data against them and use TikTok's algorithm to gain backdoor access to swaths of information on US citizens.

That is largely the reason former President Joe Biden signed legislation last April requiring TikTok to divest or face a nationwide ban. The US Supreme Court upheld the law against a constitutional challenge from TikTok and TikTok users.

In effect, the statute outlawed app stores — like those run by Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) — and cloud services from offering the app for download unless it is controlled by a country that the US does not consider adversarial.

The law resulted in TikTok's short-lived shutdown on Jan. 20, Trump's first day back in office. That same day, Trump delayed enforcement of the divestment via executive order.

The order, which experts have said is legally dubious, opened a 75-day window for the Trump administration ""to determine the appropriate course forward in an orderly way"" for TikTok's US business.

That window expires on April 5. Trump has said he is open to an extension of the 75-day pause if a deal isn't reached by the deadline.

Legal experts say TikTok's rivals, such as Meta (META), are among few parties that could even mount a challenge to any perceived shortcoming of a forthcoming Trump deal.

""It would be hard for someone to challenge,"" said Alan Rozenshtein, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School. ""But Mark Zuckerberg could argue, 'I'm upset because the government is doing something that's helping one of my rivals, illegally, and that hurts me.'""

But even competitors who could argue that TikTok's continuing presence in the US is undermining their lawful business would find it difficult to establish standing, Guggenberger said.

“That's just very, very, very, unlikely to succeed,” he added.

Members of Congress may have some recourse if they feel the law is not being enforced. They could amend the statute, create a new one that provides a private right of action, or add other pressures that would force TikTok to comply.

“I don't see that playing out politically in any way,” Guggenberger said, noting the hold Trump has on Republicans who control both the House and Senate and the fact that Trump would need to sign off on any new laws.

Oops, something went wrong

I need to know the answer to one important question today.

Why are you buying the dip in stocks? Is it because it has worked so well for you in the past five years? Is it that you have so much money invested in the markets that you aren't sure where else to put it? Is there another reason?

Send me your answers on X @BrianSozzi. I'm very curious. I will begin replying after 7:30 a.m. from the parking lot of my gym after I finish working out.

The cold hard data suggests that despite all of the negatives weighing on the markets (tariffs, inflated S&P 500 earnings estimates, slowing economic data — I can go on), investors continue to hit the buy button on dips.

Retail investors have ""significantly bulled up"" of late, Vanda Track strategist Marco Iachini pointed out. This often-eager investor class has poured $32.9 billion into US markets since the S&P 500's (^GSPC) late February lows. That is in the 97th percentile of any 24-day stretch since 2014, Iachini found.

Retail investors' top purchases during this period were for shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Palantir (PLTR), Amazon (AMZN), and AMD (AMD), in that order.

Investors are showing the strongest conviction in US stocks, which runs counter to various red flags in consumer sentiment surveys.

""The renewed gap between purchases of single stocks and ETFs corroborate the view that retail investors are taking a glass half-full view after a series of half puts from the Fed, macro data and Trump in recent weeks,"" Iachini wrote. ""In particular, the rising share of purchases of Magnificent 7+ names we highlighted two weeks ago has continued to climb higher.""

""This shift away from broad ETFs suggests individuals see these names as either on sale or as relative safe havens despite recent underperformance,"" Iachini added. ""Historically, increases in ETF buying coincide with growing fear across market participants. We're not there yet.""

Are you one of these individuals buying the dips and excited that the S&P 500 is back above its 200-day moving average (though historical data suggests you should be worried)?

Let me remind you of the backdrop that I would characterize as teeming with risks to stocks.

Auto tariffs are here, and more duties on other stuff are likely coming in a few weeks. Tariffs aren't some BS thing; they stand to cause real harm to companies' profits.

Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs

JPMorgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman cut estimates and price targets on Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) after the 25% tariff announcement this week, citing ""increased potential for material earnings risk from draconian auto tariffs that now seem likelier than ever to be imposed as soon as April 3.""

Note the word ""material."" 

In the meantime, big companies Delta (DAL), FedEx (FDX), and Nike (NKE) have warned about near-term demand trends this month.

And now Wall Street is out there slashing their S&P 500 price targets.

The top business leaders I talk to each day are sounding more cautious about the economy.

Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) CEO Sharon Price John told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above) that tariffs mean higher toy prices. Fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff told me the same thing in an episode that will drop on April 2 at 8:00 a.m. ET.

Others have told me privately that the uncertainty on policy has begun to weigh on orders. In turn, that is causing them to rethink their guidance — more on that when earnings season begins in a few weeks.

""Ambiguity is the No. 1 enemy of a market,"" former director of the National Economic Council and current IBM (IBM) vice chair Gary Cohn said on Opening Bid. ""When a company creates ambiguity in their earnings profile, in their growth profile, in their business model, the market will punish that stock. When politicians, legislators create ambiguity in the way that taxes are going to work, the way that capital gains are going to work, the way that they're going impose tariffs, they create ambiguity to a market and the market as a whole reprices.""

But, hey, keep dip-buying.

Oops, something went wrong

Late last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reached a settlement with a small mortgage lender based in Chicago, Townstone Financial, fining the company for discriminating against Black homebuyers and discouraging them from applying for loans by bad-mouthing the city's heavily African American South Side on the radio.

Though Townstone was a minor firm, the case was a major court victory for the government, which described it as a blow against “modern-day redlining” — the practice of refusing to lend in minority neighborhoods.

Learn more: What is redlining, and how does it affect Black communities? 

In a surprise move this week, however, the CFPB asked a court to undo its settlement and dismiss the case, claiming it had discovered “significant undisclosed problems” with the investigation that led to the suit, which it said had “trampled” on Townstone's First Amendment rights. What's more, the agency asked the judge for permission to return $105,000 that Townstone already paid in penalties.

Under Trump, the CFPB has dropped a slew of lawsuits that it filed late in the Biden administration, including ones against Capital One, the organization that runs Zelle, Rocket Homes, and other major financial institutions.

But its decision in Townstone has dumbfounded former officials and consumer advocates, who struggled to think of any other example of the government attempting to scrap an enforcement case it had already effectively won and offering to refund a penalty.

“I've never seen anything like it,” said Sam Levine, the former head of consumer protection at the Federal Trade Commission during the Biden administration. Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the progressive activist organization Public Citizen, called the action “both bizarre and appalling.”

Adding to their sense of shock: The CFPB originally filed its case against Townstone in 2020 during Trump's first term under his own handpicked director, Kathy Kraninger.

                            Privacy Policy
                        
 

Some consumer protection activists said they were concerned about the precedent the CFPB's request might set, since it would likely encourage other companies to try reopening old, settled cases. “I would go to the Trump administration and say, hey, you did this for Townstone Financial, can you do this for our settlement too?” said Christine Chen Zinner, senior policy counsel at Americans for Financial Reform.

The CFPB did not return a request for comment.

Illegal redlining or protected speech?

The Townstone case largely focused on comments its executives made on an in-house weekly podcast and AM radio show they used for marketing, “The Townstone Financial Show.” The government argued that it was essentially an extended infomercial, where the firm's owners and employees talked about issues around mortgages and homebuying — and occasionally took shots at Black neighborhoods in Chicago and surrounding Cook County.

In one episode, for instance, Townstone's co-founder and CEO described Friday through Sunday on the South Side as “hoodlum weekend” and said the police were the only ones preventing it from turning into a “war zone.” On a different occasion, a host said that walking through the South Side at 3 a.m. would deliver “the same rush” as skydiving. In others, the host said that people needed to “drive very fast” and not “look at anybody” in the nearby, mostly Black city of Markham and called a Jewel-Osco in downtown Chicago “Jungle Jewel.” They added that the grocery store was a “scary place” because it was packed with “people from all over the world.”

The CFPB argued that Townstone's remarks signaled it wasn't interested in issuing mortgages in Black and other minority neighborhoods, running afoul of regulations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that ban lenders from discouraging potential customers from applying based on race, including in their advertising.

A lower court judge initially dismissed the case, finding that those regulations went beyond what Congress had intended when it passed the law. But the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed and let the suit go forward, eventually leading to a settlement and fine. Though Townstone did bring up a defense that its show was protected by the First Amendment, the issue was never actually litigated.

The appeals court win and penalty made “clear that people are protected from illegal redlining even before they submit their application,” then-CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said last November.

Conservative groups had long seen the case as an injustice, however. In 2023, researchers at the Competitive Enterprise Institute published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal arguing that the CFPB was misusing antidiscrimination laws to essentially censor speech about crime in Chicago, and compared the comments from Townstone's executives to when the city's own mayor recalled having to shield his children “from bullets that fly right outside our front door.”

This January, the group argued in the Washington Examiner that Trump's CFPB should “take the unusual but warranted step of rescinding” the fine that Townstone paid and “perhaps provide compensation to the firm for the disruption of its business.”

The CFPB, which has largely shut down operations under the second Trump administration, now says the suit should never have been brought. On Wednesday, it filed a motion in which it said officials had conducted a review of the suit's history and found that Townstone had been unfairly “targeted” based on “constitutionally protected speech.”

The motion accuses investigators of essentially cherry-picking a handful of comments on the company's show, pointing out that the government used audio analysis software to find 16 minutes of content from more than 78 hours of tape. The CFPB also never found any potential borrowers who actually claimed to have been discouraged from taking a loan, it noted.

In a statement Wednesday, the acting CFPB Director Russ Vought suggested that the agency's reversal was part of the administration's broader effort to undo diversity, equity, and inclusion policies in the public and private sector.

“The CFPB abused its power, used radical ‘equity' arguments to tag Townstone as racist with zero evidence, and spent years persecuting and extorting them — all to further the goal of mandating DEI in lending via their regulation by enforcement tactics,” he said.

A powerful message

Progressive consumer advocates told Yahoo Finance that they were fearful the case signaled it would now be open season for lenders who want to discriminate against borrowers. “Dropping this settlement sends a crystal clear message to businesses that discriminatory conduct is somehow now allowed,” said Public Citizen's Gilbert.

It is unclear whether US District Judge Franklin Valderrama, who is overseeing the case, will grant the government's request to roll back its own settlement. If he does, it may set a template for the Trump administration to try to undo other old settlement deals.

John Berlau, the Competitive Enterprise senior fellow who advocated for the case to be reversed, said he thought it was unlikely that Trump would try to upend many old settlements. The Townstone executives were “victims of an egregious, unconstitutional prosecution” that required extraordinary action, he argued.

Commercial advertisements usually receive a lower level of protection under the First Amendment than political speech. But Berlau said that Townstone's program was no different than other podcasts run by business owners aimed at a general audience.

”I think this sends a powerful message to agencies not to weaponize the law against free speech rights,” Berlau said.

Oops, something went wrong

Delaware lawmakers this week pushed through controversial changes governing corporate behavior in a scramble to keep more businesses from leaving the state following the dramatic exit of Elon Musk.

Gov. Matthew Meyer signed the SB 21 legislation into law Tuesday and said the changes would maintain Delaware's place as the best place in the world to incorporate a business — ""ensuring clarity and predictability, balancing the interests of stockholders and corporate boards.""

The revisions came in response to a string of complaints from prominent CEOs, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Musk, who moved incorporations out of state or threatened to do so. The exits even gained a nickname: ""Dexits.”

Musk has already moved the incorporations of Tesla and his rocket-building company, SpaceX (SPAX.PVT), to Texas. Neuralink (NEUR.PVT), Boring, and the social media platform X — three other companies he oversees — have left for Nevada.

Over the past year, Meta (META), Dropbox (DBX), hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, Trade Desk (TTD), Fidelity National Financial (FNF), and Sonoma Pharmaceuticals (SNOA) have all floated plans to move their incorporations.

The talk of high-profile departures is roiling a state that, for roughly the past century, has been the dominant place to incorporate because of its so-called corporate-friendly laws, specialized business courts, and ease of filing company documents.

The state touts that it is home to more than two-thirds of all Fortune 500 companies. In 2023, Delaware hit a record 2 million total incorporations but saw a drop in the percentage of Fortune 500 companies registered there to 67.6% from 68.2% in 2022.

The state's newly elected Democratic governor, Meyer, launched a working group to study mounting complaints, and lawmakers rushed to push through a bill that would limit investor lawsuits by allowing corporate boards to further insulate their directors, officers, and controlling shareholders from liability.

Musk decided to leave the state after a controversial decision by a Delaware judge to wipe out his $56 billion performance-based compensation plan. He is now appealing that decision.

The billionaire, along with current and former Tesla directors, argued in a recent appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court that the refusal by Delaware Chancery Court judge Kathaleen McCormick to reinstate Musk's pay contained multiple errors that should lead to the ruling's reversal.

The new law passed this week by the state legislature and signed by the governor extends more leeway to board members in transactions where their interests or relationships raise conflicts of interest.

It also broadens the set of conditions that investors must meet before inspecting company records, making it more difficult for plaintiffs to find evidence supporting a lawsuit.

Semafor reported that the legislation was prompted by warnings from key corporate attorneys that more big-name companies, including Walmart (WMT), might move out of the state.

Critics say the amendments amount to a handout for billionaires because they broaden safe harbor protections for corporate directors. They also object to the legislation being put to a vote without more deliberation.

Columbia Law School professors criticized Delaware lawmakers for pushing what they describe as major overhauls so quickly.

""Ordinarily, reforms of this magnitude pass through the deliberate, consensus-driven process of the Delaware Bar's Corporation Law Council. This time, however, the route appears more compressed,"" the lawyers said.

Eric Talley, one of the Columbia Law School professors who co-authored the critique, said parts of the new law may be vulnerable to state constitutional challenges.

""I suspect a challenge to be made imminently,"" Talley said.

He added that the most serious consequence for investors under the new rules is that they have less protection against actions by insiders — officers, directors, and especially large stockholders — that attempt to funnel assets away from outside investors and into the pockets of the insiders.

Oops, something went wrong

The new tariffs on imported autos President Trump announced on March 26 will have profound effects on automakers and car buyers. One of them could be the ""Cubanization"" of the US auto fleet: As car prices rise, buyers hold on to old cars longer, and the average age of the US fleet rises.

Cuba is famous, or maybe notorious, for the antique cars from the 1940s and 1950s that still ply the roads as taxicabs and personal vehicles. That's not a national sense of nostalgia. When Fidel Castro's regime seized power in 1959, the United States imposed sanctions that are still in place and effectively keep Western cars and car parts out of the country. So, Cubans have had to make do with what they had prior to the Castro takeover. While it might seem charming to visitors, jury-rigging gas guzzlers with homemade parts in a nation with fuel shortages is an ongoing nightmare for many Cuban car owners.

The Trump tariffs won't be quite as punishing, but if they stick, they will rattle the whole industry. Trump says that beginning April 3, all imported cars will face a 25% tariff. The current tariff on most imports is only 2.5%. A month later, major components such as engines and transmissions will face the same tariff.

Read more: The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs

About half of the 16 million cars sold in the United States are imports, and many components come from overseas, even if the final assembly occurs in an American factory. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimates the tariffs would boost the average car price by about $6,000. And that would apply to domestics as well as imports, since higher prices for one set of products usually allow competitors to raise their prices by a like amount.

Higher prices would depress sales. More people would shift to the used car market, which would push those prices up too, the same as it did when new cars became scarce for a time during the COVID pandemic. Higher prices will stop some people from buying altogether and force them to hold on to older cars longer.

""A strict implementation of a 25% tariff could add further elongation of average car age (the 'Cubanization' of the US car fleet),"" Jonas wrote in a March 27 analysis. ""The impacts are so potentially negative that we struggle to see how such measures can truly remain a 'permanent feature' of the US automotive landscape.""

Keeping more old cars on the road longer also has implications for safety, technology adoption, and fuel prices. New cars usually come with more safety features and better crashworthiness, which help save lives as they become standard throughout the fleet. New safety technology would arrive more slowly if shoppers buy fewer new cars.

A sales slowdown could also disrupt the cash flow many automakers are using to fund development of electric vehicles and other new systems. Most big automakers are trying to manage the tricky transition from combustion vehicles to electrics or other types of powertrains. If sales of profitable gas-powered vehicles drop, that disrupts the funding model for new technology, which would likely tilt production away from innovation.

An older fleet and a lower portion of electrics could also keep oil and gasoline demand higher than expected in the future, which would put upward pressure on prices. ""Even as rising fleet fuel economy and growing electric vehicle penetration crimp gasoline demand, higher purchase prices resulting from the tariffs could keep older, less-efficient cars driving longer on U.S. roads,"" Clearview Energy noted in a March 27 analysis.

None of this takes into account trade partner retaliation, which seems likely at some level. For now, the European Union and other countries that import autos to the United States are holding their fire, perhaps because they think they can reach some kind of deal with Trump in which he lowers the tariffs in exchange for more US production or some other concession. If that doesn't happen, however, trade partners are likely to follow the familiar script of hitting key US export categories with tariffs of their own.

Investors have been playing a guessing game on Trump's tariffs — and generally guessing wrong. Overall, Trump has levied higher customs duties than investors expected when he took office in January and shown more willingness to tolerate stock market sell-offs and other adverse effects than during his first term.

That now leaves much of the global auto industry wondering if Trump's auto tariffs will stick, triggering widespread collateral damage, or fade as Trump gets enough concessions to persuade him to relent.

Don't bet the car on the outcome.

For those who keep a close eye on their investments and trade daily, it's possible your emotions are preventing you from seeing more consistent and lucrative returns.

Wave HQ CFO Michaella Gallina detailed how investor psychology — or the emotions, biases, and decision-making patterns that influence how people invest — plays an important role in a person's portfolio.

The three biases she particularly pays close attention to are loss aversion, recency bias, and confirmation bias.

“I think loss aversion is fascinating because it's essentially the concept that we feel losses as an investor at two times the rate of the emotion that we feel joy when it comes to gains,” Gallina said on a March 4 Stocks in Translation podcast. “I think just being aware of these cognitive behaviors is the first step. Understanding that you can make emotional decisions and it can hurt you versus staying the course over the long term ... is always the first step.”

Gallina noted that loss aversion is the most damaging bias for many investors' portfolios, resulting in a “much more lasting effect” than some of the other biases that affect trading decisions.

She pointed to a 2024 JPMorgan survey that found 40% of retail investors tended to sell at market lows.

“So they're feeling those losses even more,” she said. “And then the emotional toll on top of that is even greater. So these emotional swings can cause really terrible decision making.”

It's easy for an investor to look at the short-term trends in the markets and make knee-jerk decisions in reaction to these cycles. Gallina argued that sticking to your investments, even through downturns, can actually net you larger and more consistent returns.

That said, Gallina noted that biases can even influence passive strategies. She explained that if you're following the markets, you might be hearing in the news that you should rely on diversified ETFs. If you decide to sit on the sidelines with a passive strategy, that may also reflect recency bias or confirmation bias, as you may be relying on recent information or not challenging prior beliefs.

“We tend to be more influenced by short-term news and headlines than we are long-term trends,” Gallina said. “And so as the market evolves, I could see traders who might think of passive strategy right now as the right thing over time may think differently — or the same.”

 

Similar to how many investment firms hire psychologists to help strategists understand the emotional influence of their trading habits, it's important for individual investors to evaluate the information at hand to make better decisions.

“I think data is information, and it's power,” Gallina said. “I think it's good to just understand the data points, be aware knowledge is power, and then use your own intellectual honesty to determine what your risk appetite is, what type of investments you should or shouldn't be making, whether you should even be in individual stocks or things like more passive investing.”

Myanmar earthquake: Woman pulled alive from debris

We've just had an update from Myanmar's fire services department, saying 20 people have been rescued in Shan state, which borders the badly affected regions of Mandalay and Sagaing.

Officials say nine bodies have also been recovered in the northern state, and search and rescue efforts are still under way.

As we've just reported, countries around the world have sent teams to Myanmar to help with search and rescue operations.

Here are a few pictures showing some of those teams on the ground in the quake-hit country.

It's been 55 hours since a deadly earthquake struck Myanmar, with tremors felt in neighbouring countries, resulting in the deaths of about 1,700 people.

On Sunday, another quake hit Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, as rescue teams in Thailand picked up signs of life under collapsed buildings.

International aid is pouring in thick and fast. China, India and Hong Kong have sent rescue teams to Myanmar to support efforts to find survivors.

There have been glimmers of hope within the search efforts. In Mandalay, the local fire authority says 29 people have been pulled from the rubble of a high-rise block. On Saturday, a 30-year-old woman was rescued after being trapped for about 30 hours.

In Bangkok, at the site of a collapsed skyscraper, the BBC has spoken to families waiting desperately for news.

Kannika is one of them. Her husband is missing. She says she'll wait “for as long as it takes”, but finds it hard to explain to her son why his dad hasn't called.

Our colleagues across the region are constantly sharing updates. Stay with us for the latest.

Since the earthquake, several countries have sent search and rescue teams to Myanmar to help. Here's a look at some of them:

Have you been affected by the earthquake in Myanmar? Did you feel the tremors in Thailand or China?

If it's safe to do so, please get in touch with us in the following ways:

Shaimaa KhalilReporting from Bangkok

Two of Pranit Rampuey's colleagues are still missing under the rubble. I saw her sitting at the edge of the fenced area across from the collapse site.

She tells me she and her colleagues normally work on a different site, but they split up that day and her colleagues came here on the day of the earthquake to fill some team gaps.

“They were like family” she tells me, sobbing.

“I feel guilty”, she adds, explaining they came to the now collapsed site and she didn't.

Her two colleagues were related – an uncle and his nephew. “He was a good boy.” She tells me of the young man. He was 27.

“I've been here all day and I've heard nothing so far. I'm still hoping they find them alive,” she says.

Nick MarshReporting from Bangkok

Kannika has been waiting here, patiently, since the early hours of Saturday morning.

Her husband, Yothin, was working as the chief electrician on the 24th floor of the unfinished tower when it collapsed. She and Yothin - who are both in their mid-30s - are from a village in northern Thailand.

Yothin came to Bangkok to work on the construction site and send the money back to his family. Kannika has travelled more than 300km in the aftermath of the earthquake to wait for news about her missing husband.

He's one of thousands of workers in Thailand who migrate to the capital to try to build a better future for their family.

""I will stay here for as long as it takes,"" she tells us, wiping tears from her eyes. Their two children, aged five and 12, are being looked after by her sister back home.

Her youngest child keeps asking: ""Why hasn't dad called, why hasn't dad called?""

""He is a very good man and a very good father. We have been together many years. I pray that they find him safe.""

The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration has given an update on the number of people killed in Thailand after the earthquake.

City officials say 18 people are confirmed dead, with 11 killed as a result of the collapsed skyscraper – 10 at the scene and one who died after being taken to hospital.

Thirty-three people are known to have been injured, and authorities say 78 are still missing.

Our colleagues have just finished translating comments from the news conference with Thailand's deputy prime minister.

Anutin Charnirakul says rescue teams have been using scanners to detect signs of life under the rubble, but the signals they've picked up are weak.

""Maybe they don't have energy to move their bodies or they take a light breath,"" he says.

He adds that searching for survivors has been tough because of large objects that can't be moved, but engineers are assessing the situation and rescuers are working on solutions.

Since the earthquake, there have been concerns about building safety rules in Bangkok. Charnirakul says there are thousands of buildings in the capital and most are ""fine"" after the quake.

""We cannot use this building as [an] example and think that we have no standard,"" he comments.

Thailand's deputy prime minister has just spoken to the media at the site of the collapsed high-rise in Bangkok.

Asked why the skyscraper – which was still under construction – came down, Anutin Charnvirakul says: “Something might have gone wrong.” 

“I've just appointed the investigation committee to search for the reasons why it collapsed. They will report back within seven days,” he says.

He adds the investigation will look into the “designer, project controller and the builder”, saying “we will definitely find the true reasons as to why this building has collapsed”.

That was from the English part of Charnvirakul's news conference – most of it was in Thai. Our colleagues are translating the rest now and we'll bring you those details shortly.

Tessa WongReporting from Bangkok

Now let's move our focus from Myanmar back to Thailand, where the earthquake has had a devastating impact.

The country's industry minister Akanat Promphan has addressed the media at the site of the Bangkok building collapse.

He says they found ""anomalies"" in the steel at the site and they have collected samples for testing.

His comments may be the closest we have heard so far from government officials regarding the possible reasons why the building could not withstand the quake.

While he did not explicitly say that these anomalies could be the reason, he did say that if the results of their investigation show that the steel used did not meet industry standards, his ministry will take legal action against those involved in the construction.

The building was constructed by a joint venture between Italian-Thai Development and the Thai branch of China Railway Number 10 Engineering, according to local media reports.

As we mentioned, the military junta has reportedly launched air strikes just after Friday's earthquake.

But who are they?

Here's a quick explainer to help refresh your knowledge on Myanmar.

Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, gained independence from Britain in 1948, but its history since then has been marked by unrest and conflict.

Power: The military seized power in 2021, ten years after agreeing to hand over control to a civilian government. Since then, the junta has cracked down hard on dissent, executing democracy activists and jailing journalists.

Capital: Nay Pyi Taw is its capital, while the largest city is Yangon, a commercial hub and former capital.

Population: 57.2 million.

Media: The 2021 coup ""shattered the media landscape"" and the junta, which ""tolerates no alternative to its narrative"", quickly banned critical outlets, according to Reporters Without Borders.

A UN official has told the BBC World Service they've had reports that Myanmar's military junta launched air strikes less than an hour after Friday's earthquake.

The military took control in a 2021 coup, and the country's been in civil war ever since.

James Rodehaver, who leads the Myanmar team at the UN human rights office, says the military ""has long been the primary limiter of humanitarian aid and access"" in the country.

He says: ""According to reports that we're receiving on the ground, in under an hour after the earthquake on Friday the military was launching air strikes.

""That was its focus. It was launching air strikes against its own people, including in areas impacted by the earthquake.

""Almost as if they wanted to target the people responding to the people trapped under the rubble.""

He says the attacks, while also asking for international aid, are ""part of their bait-and-switch tactic... employed for years"".

Rescue teams in Myanmar are still searching for people trapped under collapsed buildings, including hotels, schools, mosques, monasteries and homes.

According to updates from the country's fire services department, dozens of survivors have been found and many bodies recovered across several regions, including Mandalay and Sagaing, near the epicentre of Friday's earthquake.

In Sagaing City, 36 people have been rescued and 88 bodies recovered.

Officials say 161 people have died in Mandalay due to collapsed buildings in the Pyaw Bwe township, south of the city. 13 monks have been pulled from the rubble of the U Hla Thein Temple, where 58 people have been rescued so far. Up to 200 monks are thought to be trapped inside.

Also in Mandalay, as we mentioned earlier, 29 people have been rescued and nine bodies recovered from the well-known Sky Villa complex.

Back in Myanmar, rescue efforts are also continuing today in Mandalay, the country's second-largest city and the one closest to the epicentre.

These pictures were taken in the city earlier today.

More international aid is arriving in Myanmar, two days after a 7.7 magnitude earthquake devastated large parts of the country. 

Neighbouring Thailand is stepping up efforts to rescue people trapped in a collapsed building in the capital.

From Bangkok, BBC correspondent Arunoday Mukharji brings us the latest from the scene.

We're being moved further away from the edge of the collapse site. Families who were perched on the fence have been told to move away.

Heavy machinery is getting much closer to where we're standing.

We can feel the dust on our faces, we can taste it. We were told by an official that they are now intensifying their efforts.

From our vantage point, you can see the scale of the damage - the rubble and all the entangled iron.

The heavy machinery is moving around and it looks like they're now digging around the debris.

One official told us they are hoping they will pull out more bodies today.

Tessa WongReporting from Bangkok

In the last few minutes Thai authorities have updated a whiteboard by the main gate to the collapsed building site in Bangkok, with the latest figures.

It states there are 11 dead so far, of which eight are men and three are women. Another nine have been found injured. 

Scores of people are still missing.

Earlier, we reported that 12 people had died at the scene. But that's different from what I'm seeing now on the whiteboard. The situation is still changing and the numbers keep being updated.

Separately we have just heard that the body of a man was pulled out today, and rescuers are working to rescue a woman who is trapped under the rubble.

Stay with us as we bring you more updates.

The Baltic nations believe a ceasefire in the Ukraine conflict would increase the security threat they face, the Financial Times has reported, citing the defense ministers of the countries.

In recent weeks, a 30-day pause on strikes against energy infrastructure by Moscow and Kiev has been agreed upon, while there have been moves toward reviving the Black Sea grain deal as part of efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict. 

The FT said in an article on Sunday that “a full ceasefire is still seen as far off,” but officials in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, who have been among the most vocal backers of Ukraine in the EU and NATO since the escalation between Moscow and Kiev in February 2022, are already concerned that it might be achieved at some point. 

“We all understand that when the war in Ukraine will be stopped, Russia will redistribute its forces very quickly. That means also the threat level will increase significantly very quickly,” Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur told the outlet. 

Pevkur claimed that Moscow could redeploy 300,000 troops from the contact line with Ukraine to Russia's western borders once a ceasefire takes effect. 

Meanwhile, the Estonian defense minister rejected a plan by the UK and France to send a so-called “reassurance force” made up of Western European soldiers to Ukraine after the fighting stops. 

“We cannot jeopardize the security of the eastern flank of NATO. We cannot fall into the trap that our forces are somehow fixed in Ukraine. Then we will have risks at our border,” he explained. 

The article also cited Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene, who said earlier this week that “Russia will use this time following a ceasefire to speed up its military capabilities. They already have a huge, battlefield-trained army, which is going to get even bigger.” 

“Let us not have any illusions. Let us not lie to ourselves that Russia is going to be done after Ukraine,” she said. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly dismissed claims that Moscow has any aggressive plans towards NATO as “nonsense” that is meant to scare the European population and justify increases in military spending. 

US President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin at the Kremlin earlier this month, told American journalist Tucker Carlson last week that Russia is “100% not” interested in invading NATO countries. Suggesting that Moscow harbors such plans is “preposterous,” according to Witkoff.

US President Donald Trump has said he is sure that Washington will take over Greenland and that he has already had “absolutely” real conversations about annexing the Danish autonomous territory.

“We'll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,” Trump told the US broadcaster NBC in a phone interview on Saturday. There is a “good possibility that we could do it without military force,” he stated, adding that he would not “take anything off the table.”

According to the American president, the annexation of Greenland is an issue of “international peace” and “international security and strength.” When asked what message the move would send to the rest of the world, Trump stated: “I don't really think about that. I don't really care.”

A video shared by Trump earlier this week claimed that the island was threatened by “Russian aggression” and “Chinese expansion.” The clip stated that the partnership between Greenland and the US “is not just history. It is destiny.” Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that “Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic.”

The interview came just a day after US Vice President J.D. Vance visited the resource-rich Arctic territory. During his stay, he accused Denmark of doing a poor job for the people of Greenland. “I think that you'd be a lot better coming under the United States' security umbrella than you have been under Denmark's,” he said while visiting a US base on the island.

Trump initially proposed buying the Danish autonomous territory during his first term in 2019 and has reignited the discussion after returning to office. He has since repeatedly promised to make the island a part of the US, arguing that it is needed for security purposes.

The American president's statements have drawn an angry reaction from Copenhagen. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen stated this week that such actions were not appropriate for a close ally and were only “escalating tensions.” He also accused Trump of going “too far.”

Danish MP and Defense Committee Chairman Rasmus Jarlov warned in mid-March that the US' aspirations to annex the island could lead to a war between NATO nations. Greenland's prime minister, Mute B. Egede, also denounced what he called “aggressive pressure” by the US.

A New York Times investigation has found that the administration of former US President Joe Biden provided Ukraine with support that went far beyond arms shipments – extending to daily battlefield coordination, intelligence sharing, and joint strategy planning that were indispensable in Kiev's fight against Russia.

The report, which was prepared based on more than 300 interviews with Ukrainian and Western government and military officials, takes a deep dive into the cooperation between Washington and Kiev from the early days of the conflict through late 2024.

Following the outbreak of the hostilities in February 2022, the US and Ukraine gradually moved towards an “extraordinary partnership of intelligence, strategy, planning and technology” that became Kiev's “secret weapon” in fighting Russia, the investigation said.

The outlet noted that Washington's campaign to support Ukraine reached such a scale that it became “a rematch in a long history of US-Russia proxy wars – Vietnam in the 1960s, Afghanistan in the 1980s, Syria three decades later.” 

The US Army garrison in Wiesbaden, Germany, became the nerve center of the cooperation, according to the report. American and Ukrainian officers worked jointly each day to select Russian targets – although they avoided using the phrase, using instead the euphemism “points of interest” out of fear that the phrase could be deemed too provocative. Intelligence flowed from satellite imagery and intercepted communications directly into Ukrainian targeting decisions.

Since mid-2022, Ukraine heavily relied on US data to attack Russian command and control centers and other high-value targets. Targeting sheets contained dozens of objectives listed in order of priority, the NYT said.

Some of the massive strikes made using Western-supplied long-range missiles were aimed at targets in Crimea, including Russian warships. Some of the strikes have resulted in civilian casualties.

One unnamed European official told the paper that he was shocked by the extent of the involvement. “They are part of the kill chain now,” he was quoted as saying.

While early into the conflict the Biden administration promised that the US would not “put boots on the ground” in Ukraine, the cooperation in Wiesbaden ended up leading to an easing of this prohibition, the report claims.

Under Biden, the US “authorized clandestine operations,” and “American military advisers were dispatched to Kiev and later allowed to travel closer to the fighting,” NYT said, estimating their number in the dozens.

As the conflict progressed, the Biden administration gradually relaxed the self-imposed restrictions on supplying Kiev with arms, particularly long-range missiles. In 2024, the US extended its permissions to allow Ukraine to carry out limited long-range strikes using American-supplied weapons into internationally recognized Russian territory while providing Kiev with the relevant targeting data.

While cooperation with the US provided Ukraine with invaluable data and resources to fight Russia, the sides at times had major disagreements over strategy and objectives, the NYT noted.

“Where the Americans focused on measured, achievable objectives, they saw the Ukrainians as constantly grasping for the big win, the bright, shining prize,” the report said.

The contradictions became particularly apparent during Ukraine's botched counteroffensive in the southern sector of the front in the summer of 2023. The Ukrainian leadership was split between competing objectives – pursuing an assault toward Melitopol, and prioritizing the area of Artyomovsk (Bakhmut).

While describing the cooperation as a “secret weapon” in Kiev's arsenal, the NYT noted that the arrangement now “teeters on a knife edge” as US President Donald Trump is pushing for talks with Russia and seeking to end the conflict.

“For the Ukrainians, the auguries are not encouraging… the American president has baselessly blamed the Ukrainians for starting the war, pressured them to forfeit much of their mineral wealth and asked the Ukrainians to agree to a ceasefire without a promise of concrete American security guarantees,” the outlet summarized, adding that Trump has already started to wind down some elements of the partnership.

 US Vice President J.D. Vance and other senior officials suggested that President Donald Trump fire National Security Adviser Mike Waltz during a private discussion about an incident in which Waltz accidentally included a reporter in a confidential chat about US military strikes in Yemen, according to anonymous insider sources cited by Politico.

Two individuals said to be familiar with the closed-door meeting at the White House on Wednesday night told Politico that Vance, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, and personnel chief Sergio Gor advised Trump that it might be time to cut Waltz loose.

The president reportedly agreed that Waltz had “messed up,” but ultimately decided against dismissing him.

“Like hell he'd give the liberal media and pearl-clutching Democrats a win,” Politico wrote on Friday, citing one insider as saying the administration does not “want to give the press a scalp.”

The leak, first reported by The Atlantic on Monday, revealed that Waltz had inadvertently invited editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a confidential Signal chat where senior administration officials were discussing airstrikes on Houthi militants in Yemen. Waltz has taken “full responsibility” for the incident, calling it “embarrassing” in a Fox News interview and attributing the inclusion to a technical glitch.

Trump has largely downplayed the controversy, dismissing the media response as a “witch hunt” and questioning the reliability of Signal. He stressed that no classified information was compromised and praised the military operation as “unbelievably successful.”

“I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,” Trump told NBC News in an interview Saturday. He reiterated he still has full confidence in both Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was accused of sharing sensitive information in the Signal chat.

Vance has publicly aligned himself with the president's decision. On Friday, he brought Waltz along for a high-profile trip to Greenland, where he dismissed media speculation and defended the national security team.

“If you think you're going to force the president of the United States to fire anybody, you've got another thing coming,” Vance told reporters.

Nevertheless, Politico claimed that Waltz's position remains tenuous, citing one Trump ally who said, “They'll stick by him for now, but he'll be gone in a couple of weeks.” Other unnamed sources described longstanding personal and political tensions, alleging that Waltz has alienated colleagues by overstepping boundaries and acting more like a principal than a staffer.

A spokesman for Waltz, Brian Hughes, pushed back against the narrative, calling the reports “gossip from people lacking the integrity to attach their names.” He added that Waltz “serves at the pleasure of President Trump” and continues to have the president's support.

Former Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema has claimed that he undertook a secret diplomatic mission to Brazil and China on behalf of Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky to garner international support, amid fears that Kiev would be abandoned by its Western backers.

The revelation was made during a conversation with Italian politician Gianfranco Fini published by La Repubblica on Thursday. According to D'Alema, Zelensky approached him sometime in 2024, expressing fears of a potential catastrophe as Western support waned.

“I happened to speak with Zelensky on the sidelines of an initiative on the Balkans. And he told me clearly that his country was at risk of disaster because ‘the Americans will withdraw sooner or later, and the Europeans are not reliable,'” the former prime minister told Fini.

“He asked me to go to Brazil and Beijing to find out if Lula and Xi Jinping could do something,” D'Alema claimed. Neither Brazil nor China has publicly confirmed any visits by the former Italian official.

In Brasilia, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva reportedly dismissed the initiative outright, insisting that Ukraine is an “American problem.”

“I went there, but Lula almost showed me the door, telling me that Ukraine was a problem for the Americans and that, according to him, I should be interested in Palestine instead,” D'Alema said.

In China, D'Alema reportedly met with one of the Communist Party's top foreign policy officials, and discussed the idea of an international peacekeeping force for Ukraine. At the end of the meeting, the Chinese official is said to have remarked: “You know, you are the first European who came to talk to us about this. The others are just asking us not to support Russia.”

The former prime minister also criticized the EU for fueling what he described as unrealistic expectations about the conflict. “Europe has done nothing but repeat that Russia could be defeated, when it was clear to everyone that the war could not be won by anyone,” he said.

WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — A strong 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit near Tonga, prompting an initial tsunami warning that was later lifted for the Pacific island country. 

The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit at a depth of 29 kilometers (18 miles) and was centered about 100 kilometers (62 miles) northeast of the main island in the early morning hours of Monday local time. Hours later, a second 6.1 magnitude quake hit in the same area. 

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii issued an alert following the first quake saying hazardous waves could be possible but later said there was no longer a tsunami threat. A warning was also cancelled hours later by the country's disaster management office.

Tsunami sirens could be heard after the 1:18 a.m. quake urging residents to move inland in a live video streamed by the Tonga Broadcasting Commission. People in the capital, Nuku'alofa, were seen moving inland or to higher ground before officials gave the all-clear for residents to return home. 

There were no initial reports of casualties, TBC said, and Tongans posting on social media reported being able to place calls with most of the inhabited island chains that make up the country. It was too soon to know the extent of any damage, which would be assessed in daylight, the broadcaster added, but none was immediately reported.

Tongan taekwondo athlete Pita Taufatofua posted to Facebook that items fell from shelves and tables and pictures fell from the walls during the shaking. 




“Was hard to stand up,” he wrote. “Never felt an earthquake go for that long.”

Tonga is a country in Polynesia made up of 171 islands with a population of just over 100,000 people, most of whom live on the main island of Tongatapu. It is 1,800 km (1,100 miles) north east of New Zealand and situated on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a tectonic region of earthquakes and volcanoes.

The low-lying island nation was devastated by a tsunami in 2022 that was prompted by a volcanic eruption. Three people were killed.

BANGKOK (AP) — The Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar has been plagued by wars and natural disasters since it became independent from Britain in 1948, when it was still called Burma.

Relief efforts from Friday's devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake will be especially complicated with the country in embroiled in civil war, which began after the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021.

The main resistance movement against military rule has issued a statement saying it is unilaterally initiating a two-week ceasefire beginning Sunday in areas of the country affected by the quake. 

There was no immediate reaction from the military government, which even before the earthquake — in addition to employing massive repression and state violence — heavily restricted much-needed aid to the more than 3 million people displaced by war. 

The army's ability to facilitate or block food and other assistance has been described as a way of weaponizing aid. Critics of the military government have called repeatedly for outside assistance to be delivered directly to areas under control of the resistance.




The military, which has directly or indirectly ruled Myanmar most of the time since independence, seized power from Suu Kyi's government as it was about to begin a second five-year term. She and leaders of her National League for Democracy party were jailed, and security forces put down pro-democracy demonstrations with deadly force, leading to the growth of armed resistance, and the army in turn escalating its violence.

Despite a huge disadvantage in weaponry and manpower, pro-democracy fighters allied with ethnic minority groups seeking greater autonomy have successfully battled back, and analysts believe they control a much greater share of territory.

The resistance is coordinated by the self-styled National Unity Government, whose claim to legitimacy is that it was formed by elected lawmakers. The NUG, which operates underground, has an armed wing called the People's Defense Force.

The PDF is largely a conglomeration of locally formed defense groups, poorly armed but usually with the advantage of fighting on home ground. Their ethnic allies are much more experienced and have even managed in some cases to manufacture their own weapons. 

The National Unity Government said in an announcement Saturday that the PDF will implement a two-week pause in offensive military operations starting Sunday in earthquake-affected areas, while retaining the right to self-defense.

It said it would collaborate with the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations “to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps,” in the areas it controls. It also offered to provide health care professionals loyal to its resistance movement to work with international humanitarian organizations to deliver emergency rescue and medical services in areas under the military's control, if provided with safety guarantees.

The PDF fighters rarely mount large-scale offensives, sticking mainly to defense and ambush-style attacks, so its ceasefire would be largely symbolic. By taking the moral high ground, it gives its supporters a stronger argument to push for the unrestricted distribution of aid. 

Although the military government has made the rare gesture of soliciting foreign emergency aid, its critics are skeptical that it will deploy it fairly and effectively. 

The military's record is discouraging. For instance, it initially refused to allow in foreign rescue teams or many emergency supplies after Cyclone Nargis in 2008, which resulted in well over 100,000 deaths, and tens of thousands more left unaccounted for. Even after it agreed to accept foreign help, it was with severe restrictions.

When Cyclone Mocha ripped into the coast in May 2023, the military's relief efforts were again tardy, and as in 2008, private relief missions were discouraged, as was reporting. Property damage was heavy and while 145 deaths were officially acknowledged, independent accounts put the total at over 400.

There are examples in other countries when the effort to rebuild after natural disasters have played a part in helping to restore peace to areas torn by conflict, most notably in Indonesia's Aceh province after it was devastated by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian drones hit a military hospital, shopping center and apartment blocks in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv, killing two people and wounding dozens, while U.S. President Donald Trump voiced anger at Russian President Vladimir Putin for comments he made about the leader of Ukraine. 

Ukraine's General Staff denounced the “deliberate, targeted shelling” of the military hospital late Saturday. Among the casualties were service members who were undergoing treatment, it said. Regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said those killed were a 67-year-old man and a 70-year-old woman. 

According to Ukrainian government and military analysts, Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in the coming weeks to maximize pressure on Kyiv and strengthen the Kremlin's negotiating position in ceasefire talks.

Ukraine's air force reported that Russia fired 111 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks overnight into Sunday. It said 65 of them were intercepted and another 35 were lost, likely having been electronically jammed. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that over the past week “most regions of Ukraine” came under Russian attack. Writing on X, he said “1,310 Russian guided aerial bombs, over 1,000 attack drones — mostly ‘Shaheds' — and nine missiles of various types, including ballistic ones” had been launched against Ukraine. 

Zelenskyy also repeated his assertion that “Russia is dragging out the war,” echoing comments he made Thursday in Paris that Russia is prolonging ceasefire talks “just to buy time and then try to grab more land.” 




Russia's Ministry of Defense, meanwhile, said its air defense systems shot down six Ukrainian drones. It also claimed Sunday that its troops had taken control of a village in Ukraine's partly occupied Donetsk region. The Russian claim could not be independently verified, and Ukraine did not comment. 

In an early Sunday morning phone interview with NBC News, Trump was referencing comments Putin made Friday about temporarily putting Ukraine under external governance. Trump said he was “angry, pissed off” when Putin “started getting into Zelenskyy's credibility.”

Putin repeated his claim that Zelenskyy, whose term expired last year, lacks the legitimacy to sign a peace deal. Under Ukraine's constitution it is illegal for the country to hold national elections while it's under martial law.

“If a deal isn't made, and if I think it was Russia's fault, I'm going to put secondary sanctions on Russia,” Trump told Kristen Welker, adding that there would be “a 25 to 50-point tariff on all oil.”

 “Anybody buying oil from Russia will not be able to sell their product, any product, not just oil, into the United States,” he said.

Nonetheless, Trump reiterated that he and Putin have a “very good relationship.”

Emergency rescue teams on Sunday began trickling into the area of Myanmar hardest hit by a massive earthquake that killed more than 1,600 people. But their efforts were hindered by buckled roads, downed bridges, spotty communications and the challenges of operating in a country in the midst of a civil war.

Extensive damage could be seen in Myanmar's capital Naypyitaw on Sunday, two days after a massive earthquake killed more than 1,600 people and left countless others buried. The 7.7 magnitude quake hit midday Friday with an epicenter near Mandalay, bringing down scores of buildings and damaging other infrastructure like the city's airport.

Crews were seen recovering two more bodies from the site of a collapsed high-rise under construction in Bangkok overnight Saturday after the powerful earthquake which rocked the Thai capital. Nine of the 10 fatalities so far announced in Thailand were at construction site near the city's Chatuchak market, while 78 people were still unaccounted for.

MANDALAY, Myanmar (AP) — The smell of decaying bodies permeated the streets of Myanmar's second-largest city on Sunday as people worked frantically by hand to clear rubble in the hope of finding someone still alive, two days after a massive earthquake struck that killed more than 1,600 people and left countless others buried. 

The 7.7 magnitude quake hit midday Friday with an epicenter near Mandalay, bringing down scores of buildings and damaging other infrastructure like the city's airport. 

Relief efforts have been hampered by buckled roads, downed bridges, spotty communications and the challenges of operating in a country in the midst of a civil war.

The search for survivors has been primarily conducted by the local residents without the aid of heavy equipment, moving rubble by hand and with shovels in 41-degree Celsius (106 Fahrenheit) heat, with only the occasional tracked excavator to be seen.

A 5.1 magnitude aftershock Sunday afternoon prompted screams from those in the streets, and then the work continued. 

Many of Mandalay's 1.5 million people spent the night sleeping on the streets, either left homeless by the quake, which also shook neighboring Thailand and killed at least 18 people there, or worried that the continuing aftershocks might cause structures left unstable to collapse.




So far 1,644 people have been reported killed in Myanmar and 3,408 injured, but many areas have not yet been reached, and many rescue efforts so far have been undertaken by people working by hand to try and clear rubble, said Cara Bragg, the Yangon-based manager of Catholic Relief Services in Myanmar.

“It's mainly been local volunteers, local people who are just trying to find their loved ones,” Bragg said after bring briefed by her colleague in Mandalay. 

“I've also seen reports that now some countries are sending search and rescue teams up to Mandalay to support the efforts, but hospitals are really struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, there's a shortage of medical supplies, and people are struggling to find food and clean water,” Bragg added.

The organization was sending a team by road on Sunday to assess peoples' most pressing needs so that it could target its own response.

With the Mandalay airport damaged and the control tower toppled in the capital Naypitaw's airport, all commercial flights into the cities have been shut down. 

Official relief efforts in Naypitaw were prioritizing government offices and staff housing, leaving locals and aid groups to dig through the rubble by hand in residential areas, the hot sun beating down and the smell of death in the air. 

A team sent from neighboring China rescued an older man who had been trapped for nearly 40 hours beneath the rubble of a Naypitaw hospital, and many others are believed to still be buried under, the official Xinhua news agency reported. 

Myanmar sits on the Sagaing Fault, a major north-south fault that separates the India plate and the Sunda plate.

The earthquake occurred when a 200-kilometer (125-mile) section of the fault ruptured, causing widespread damage along a wide swath of territory down the middle of the country, including Sagaing, Mandalay, Magway and Bago regions and Shan State. 

With widespread telecommunication outages, few details have come out so far from areas other than the main urban areas of Mandalay and Naypitaw.

Still, two Indian C-17 military transport aircraft were able to land late Saturday at Naypitaw with a field hospital unit and some 120 personnel who were then to travel north to Mandalay to establish a 60-bed emergency treatment center, according to the country's Foreign Ministry. Other Indian supplies were flown into Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city, which has been the hub of other foreign relief efforts. 

On Sunday, a convoy of 17 Chinese cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies was expected to reach Mandalay, after making the arduous journey by road from Yangon. 

The 650-kilometer (400-mile) journey has been taking 14 hours or longer, with clogged roads and traffic diverted from the main highway to skirt damage from the earthquake. 

At the same time, the window of opportunity to find anyone alive is rapidly closing. Most rescues occur within the first 24 hours after a disaster, and then survival chances drop as each day passes.

An initial report on earthquake relief efforts issued Saturday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted the severe damage or destruction of many health facilities, and warned that a “severe shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers.”

China said it has sent more than 135 rescue personnel and experts along with supplies like medical kits and generators and pledged around $13.8 million in emergency aid. Russia's Emergencies Ministry said it had flown in 120 rescuers and supplies to Yangon, and the country's Health Ministry said Moscow had sent a medical team to Myanmar.

Teams from Singapore have been working already in Naypitaw. Malaysia dispatched a team of 50 personnel on Sunday with trucks, search and rescue equipment and medical supplies. Thailand said 55 of its soldiers arrived in Yangon on Sunday to help with search and rescue operations, while Britain announced a $13 million aid package to help its locally-funded partners already in Myanmar respond to the crisis.

In neighboring Thailand, the quake rocked much of the country, bringing down a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok, some 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) away from the epicenter.

So far, 11 people have been found dead at the construction site near the popular Chatuchak market. A total of 18 people have been reported killed by the quake in Thailand so far. 

In Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, rescue efforts so far are focused on Mandalay and Naypyitaw, which are thought to have been the hardest hit, but many other areas were also impacted and little is known so far about the damage there. 

“We're hearing reports of hundreds of people trapped in different areas,” said Bragg. “Right now we're at 1,600 (known fatalities) and we don't have a lot of data coming out but you've got to assume it will be increasing in the thousands based on what the impacts are. This is just anecdotal information at this point.”

Beyond the earthquake damage, rescue efforts are complicated by the bloody civil war roiling much of the country, including in quake-affected areas. In 2021, the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has since turned into significant armed resistance.

Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are dangerous or impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations.

The government military has been fighting long-established militias and newly formed pro-democracy People's Defense Forces, and has heavily restricted much-needed aid efforts to the large population already displaced by war even before the earthquake.

Military attacks continued with airstrikes on Friday and reports of mortar and drone attacks on Saturday. 

Tom Andrews, a monitor on rights in Myanmar commissioned by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, called for the military to immediately call a ceasefire.

“Aid workers should not have to fear arrest and there should be no obstructions to aid getting to where it is most needed,” he said on X. “Every minute counts.” 

Rising and Peck reported from Bangkok. Jintamas Saksornchai in Bangkok, Simina Mistreanu in Taipei, Taiwan and Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia contributed to this report.

This story has been corrected to show that the military seized power in 2021, not 2001.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinians in the Gaza Strip had little to celebrate Sunday as they marked the normally festive Eid al-Fitr with rapidly dwindling food supplies and renewed fighting in the Israel-Hamas war. Israeli strikes killed at least 19 people, mostly women and children, health officials said.



Many prayed outside demolished mosques on the holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. It's supposed to be a joyous occasion when families feast and purchase new clothes for children, but most of Gaza's 2 million people are just trying to survive.



“It's the Eid of sadness,” Adel al-Shaer said after attending prayers amid rubble in the central town of Deir al-Balah. “We lost our loved ones, our children, our lives and our futures.”



Twenty members of his extended family have been killed by Israeli strikes, including four young nephews a few days ago, he said and began to cry.



Israel ended the ceasefire with Hamas and resumed the 17-month war earlier this month with a surprise bombardment that killed hundreds, after the militant group refused to accept changes to the truce reached in January. Israel has not allowed food, fuel or humanitarian aid to enter Gaza for a month.

“There is killing, displacement, hunger and a siege,” said Saed al-Kourd, a worshipper. “We go out to perform God's rituals in order to make the children happy, but as for the joy of Eid? There is no Eid.”






Arab mediators are trying to get the truce back on track. Hamas said Saturday it had accepted a new proposal from Egypt and Qatar. Israel said it made a counter-proposal in coordination with the United States, which has also been mediating. The details were not immediately known.











Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would continue military operations while negotiating. He rejected claims that Israel does not want to end the war, while laying out conditions that go far beyond the signed ceasefire agreement and have been rejected by Hamas.



“Hamas will disarm. Its leaders will be allowed out. We will look out for the general security in the Gaza Strip and allow for the realization of (President Donald) Trump's plan,” Netanyahu told a Cabinet meeting.



Trump has proposed that Gaza's population be resettled in other countries so the U.S. can redevelop Gaza for others. Palestinians say they do not want to leave their homeland. Human rights experts say the plan would likely violate international law.



Israeli strikes on Sunday morning killed at least 16 people, including nine children and three women, according to Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis.



Two girls appeared to be wearing new clothes purchased for the holiday, according to an Associated Press cameraman, including spotless sneakers.



On Sunday evening, a strike hit a tent in Deir al-Balah and killed at least two people, according to an AP journalist at the hospital.



The Palestine Red Crescent Society said 14 bodies were recovered in the southern city of Rafah, including eight of its emergency medical technicians and five members of Gaza's Civil Defense, all who had been missing for a week. Israel's military has said it fired on advancing “suspicious vehicles” and later discovered some were ambulances.



The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages. Hamas is still holding 59 captives — 24 believed to be alive.



Israel's offensive has killed over 50,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it operates in densely populated areas.











Netanyahu's security Cabinet approved the construction of a road for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Critics say it will open the door for Israel to annex a key area just outside Jerusalem, further undermining the feasibility of a future Palestinian state.



Netanyahu's office said the project is meant to streamline travel for Palestinians in communities near the large Jewish settlement of Maaleh Adumim.



Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement watchdog group, said the road will divert Palestinian traffic outside of Maaleh Adumim and the surrounding area known as E1, a tract of open land deemed essential for the territorial contiguity of a future state.



That will make it easier for Israel to annex E1, according to Hagit Ofran, a settlement expert with the group, because Israel can claim there is no disruption to Palestinian movement. Critics say Israeli settlements and other land grabs make a contiguous future state increasingly impossible.



Several roads in the West Bank are meant for use by either Israelis or Palestinians, which international rights groups say is part of an apartheid system, allegations Israel rejects.



Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three for their future state. A two-state solution is widely seen as the only way to resolve the decades-old conflict.

BANGKOK (AP) — Emergency aid has streamed into Southeast Asia in the two days since a massive earthquake struck Myanmar and Thailand. Relief efforts are focused on Myanmar, where the estimated death toll rose to 1,644 by Sunday afternoon.

The number of dead from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake is expected to increase, while the number of injured was 3,408 and 139 people were missing as of Sunday. The earthquake's epicenter was near Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city with 1.5 million people. In neighboring Thailand, the death toll rose to 17.

While food, medicine and other vital supplies have reached Myanmar, a report issued Saturday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said rescue efforts have been hampered by a severe shortage of medical supplies including trauma kits, blood bags, anesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicine and tents to house health workers.

“We fear it may be weeks before we understand the full extent of destruction caused by this earthquake,” said Mohammed Riyas, the IRC's Myanmar director.

Here is a look at some of the contributions in supplies, personnel and monetary support and the nations and groups providing assistance:




On Sunday, a convoy of 17 Chinese cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies was expected to reach Mandalay. China said it has sent more than 135 rescue personnel and experts along with supplies like medical kits, generators, earthquake detectors and drones while pledging around $13.8 million in emergency aid. 

Hong Kong on Saturday dispatched 51 search-and-rescue personnel including firefighters and ambulance personnel as well as two search-and-rescue dogs. The group brought 9 tons (18,000 pounds) of equipment including life detectors and an automatic satellite tracking antenna system, according to a statement on the Hong Kong government's website. The Hong Kong government also will set aside HK$30 million ($3.9 million) from its Disaster Relief Fund to help Myanmar victims. 

Russia's Emergencies Ministry said it had flown in 120 rescuers and supplies to Yangon, Myanmar's second-largest city, and Russia's Health Ministry said Moscow had sent a medical team that includes specialists in infectious diseases, resuscitation, traumatology and psychology, as well as search and rescue teams with canine units and devices that can search in rubble with depths as much as 4.5 meters (14.7 feet).

Two Indian C-17 military transport aircraft on Saturday brought in a field hospital unit and some 120 personnel who traveled north to Mandalay to establish a 60-bed emergency treatment center, the country's Foreign Ministry said. India previously said it planned to send five aircrafts and four ships with relief supplies including rescue team and medical teams.

Malaysia's foreign ministry said the country would send 50 personnel to help identify and provide aid to the worst-hit areas.

South Korea said it will provide $2 million in humanitarian aid through international organizations.

New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said in a post on X that his government would support relief efforts “via the International Red Cross Movement.”

The European Commission said Friday it would release 2.5 million euros ($2.7 million) in initial emergency assistance to assist with earthquake relief, bringing the European Union's total humanitarian aid for Myanmar to more than €35 million ($37.8 million) this year.

Ireland announced Saturday the government would provide an aid package of €6 million ($6.49 million) with €3 million ($3.2 million) to support the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Myanmar Red Cross Society, €1.5 million ($1.6 million) each to the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund and U.N. Refugee Agency Joint Response Plan.

President Donald Trump said Friday the U.S. would help with the response, but some experts were concerned about the promised effort given his administration's deep cuts in foreign assistance.

The U.N. humanitarian affairs office said it has mobilized with other groups and $5 million has been allocated from a Central Emergency Response Fund for “life-saving assistance.”

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies released 2 million Swiss francs ($2.2 million) in emergency funds to support the organization's work in Myanmar, Jagan Chapagain, the organization's secretary general and CEO, said in a social media post Sunday.

Cara Bragg, the Yangon-based manager of Catholic Relief Services in Myanmar, said relief efforts have largely consisted of local volunteers trying to find loved ones.

Despite the influx of countries sending search and rescue teams, “hospitals are really struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, there's a shortage of medical supplies, and people are struggling to find food and clean water,” Bragg said.

BANGKOK (AP) — Friday's deadly earthquake rattled most of Myanmar and Thailand but certain areas sustained the heaviest damage, including flattened buildings and many lost lives.

The death toll of the 7.7 magnitude earthquake on Friday rose quickly in Myanmar and was at 1,644 victims by Sunday. There were a further 3,408 people injured and 139 missing. 

In the greater Bangkok area, which took the brunt of the quake in Thailand, officials said Sunday the count was 18 dead, 33 injured and 78 people missing.

Officials were still assessing the damage and any overall estimate remains incomplete. But two days later a clearer picture has emerged about the extent of the destruction.

Myanmar sits on the major north-south Sagaing Fault, which separates the India and Sunda plates, and the widespread damage runs down a wide swath of the middle of the country. The area includes Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city with 1.5 million people that is located near the earthquake's epicenter.

Critical infrastructure has been destroyed including the historic Ava Bridge connecting Sagaing and Mandalay, Mandalay University and various heritage sites, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement Sunday.

Little information has come out so far from areas other than the main urban areas of Mandalay city and Naypitaw and the Red Cross said the airports remain closed in both areas.




Significant damage also has been reported in the Sagaing, Naypyidaw, Magway, Bago and Shan State regions, while telecommunications outages continued to hamper emergency coordination in several regions, the Red Cross said. 

The Red Cross said it has launched an emergency appeal for 100 million Swiss francs ($113.3 million) to assist 100,000 people in 20,000 households over the next 24 months.

A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world's worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world's worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.

The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts.

Announcing that the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: “Farewell, junk food!” It encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.

“One of the core principles of the new Mexican school system is healthy living,” said Mario Delgado, the public health secretary. “There's a high level of acceptance of this policy among parents.” 

Mexico's ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogram the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic. 

In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration's health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to upend the nation's food system and “ Make America Healthy Again "" by targeting ultra-processed foods to curb surging obesity and disease.

Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020. 




Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.

“It is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,” said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has championed the ban.

Mexico's children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation's childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40% of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.

“At my daughter's school, they told us that future activities wouldn't have candy, it would be completely different, with fruit, vegetables and other food that's healthy for kids,” said Aurora Martínez, a mother of two. “It will help us a lot.” 

One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.

School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from $545 to $5,450.

But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico's 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains — even reliable internet and electricity. 

It also wasn't immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends.

“It will be difficult,” said Abril Geraldine Rose de León, a child therapist. “But it will be achieved in the long run.”

(Qatar Ministry of Foreign Affairs via AP)









WASHINGTON (AP) — An American woman detained for weeks in Afghanistan by the Taliban has been released from custody, according to a person familiar with the matter and a social media post Saturday from a longtime U.S. diplomat.

Faye Dail Hall, who was detained in February on charges of using a drone without authorization, was released as part of a deal that Qatari negotiators helped broker, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the negotiations.

The person said that Hall was taken to the Qatari Embassy in Kabul, the Afghan capital, and was in good health, and that arrangements were being made for her to return to the U.S.

In a post on X, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, confirmed Hall's release with a photograph of her and said she would “soon be on her way home.” He posted that she was “now in the care of our friends, the Qataris in Kabul, and will soon be on her way home.” 

Few details about Hall's case or the release were immediately available Saturday, including why she was in Afghanistan or how long or the circumstances of her detention. The State Department did not immediately comment.

Hall is believed to be the fourth American released from Afghanistan since January.

Earlier this month, George Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was freed after more than two years in custody. That release follows a separate deal, executed on the final day of the Biden administration and also mediated by the Qataris, that secured the releases of Ryan Corbett and William McKenty.




Officials in Kabul said recently that the U.S. had lifted bounties on three senior Taliban figures, including the interior minister, who also heads a powerful network blamed for attacks against Afghanistan's former Western-backed government.

A Foreign Ministry official, Zakir Jalaly, has said the Taliban's release of Glezmann and the removal of bounties showed both sides were “moving beyond the effects of the wartime phase and taking constructive steps to pave the way for progress” in bilateral relations.

Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, make the remarks in a video posted to social media after U.S. Vice President JD Vance's visit to the strategic island.

US Vice President JD Vance says Denmark has “underinvested” in Greenland's security and demands Denmark change its approach as President Donald Trump continues to talk of taking over the Danish territory. Vance spoke to US troops at Pituffik Space Base.

Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of the Demokraatit, the biggest party in parliament, was sworn in as prime minister. It happened as U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance arrived in Greenland to visit America's Pituffik Space Base.

Vice President JD Vance and his wife on Friday toured a U.S. military base in Greenland. The visit was revised after an initial three-day trip to the semi-autonomous Danish territory created uproar among Greenlanders and Danes who were irked that the travel plans were announced without previous consultation.

NUUK, Greenland (AP) — The Danish foreign minister on Saturday scolded the Trump administration for its “tone” in criticizing Denmark and Greenland, saying his country is already investing more into Arctic security and remains open to more cooperation with the U.S.

Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen made the remarks in a video posted to social media after U.S. Vice President JD Vance's visit to the strategic island. Later Saturday, though, U.S. President Donald Trump maintained an aggressive tone, telling NBC News that “I never take military force off the table” in regards to acquiring Greenland.

“Many accusations and many allegations have been made. And of course we are open to criticism,” Rasmussen said speaking in English. “But let me be completely honest: we do not appreciate the tone in which it is being delivered. This is not how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.”

Greenland is a territory of Denmark, which is a NATO ally of the United States. Trump wants to annex the territory, claiming it's needed for national security purposes.

In Saturday's interview, Trump allowed that “I think there's a good possibility that we could do it without military force.”

“This is world peace, this is international security,” he said, but added: “I don't take anything off the table.”

Trump also said “I don't care” when asked in the NBC interview what message it would send to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is trying to solidify his hold on Ukrainian territory three years after his invasion.




Vance on Friday said Denmark has “underinvested” in Greenland's security and demanded that Denmark change its approach as Trump pushes to take over the Danish territory.

Vance visited U.S. troops on Pituffik Space Base on mineral-rich Greenland alongside his wife and other senior U.S. officials for a trip that was ultimately scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danes who were not consulted about the original itinerary.

“Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,” Vance said Friday. “You have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change.”

Trump on Friday released a video on his social networking site Truth Social entitled “America Stands With Greenland,” showing footage of U.S. troops there during World War II. 

In Greenland, Vance said the U.S. has “no option” but to take a significant position to ensure the security of the island as he encouraged a push in Greenland for independence from Denmark.

“I think that they ultimately will partner with the United States,” Vance said. “We could make them much more secure. We could do a lot more protection. And I think they'd fare a lot better economically as well.”

The reaction by members of Greenland's parliament and residents has rendered that unlikely, with anger erupting over the Trump administration's attempts to annex the vast Arctic island. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen pushed back on Vance's claim that Denmark isn't doing enough for defense in the Arctic, calling her country “a good and strong ally.”

And Greenlandic lawmakers on Thursday agreed to form a new government, banding together to resist Trump's overtures. Four of the five parties elected to Greenland's parliament earlier this month have agreed to form a coalition that will have 23 of 31 seats in the legislature.

The following day, Danish King Frederik X posted on Facebook: “We live in an altered reality. There should be no doubt that my love for Greenland and my connectedness to the people of Greenland are intact.”

Hundreds of protesters demonstrated Saturday outside the U.S. Embassy in the Danish capital Copenhagen with some lifting signs saying, “back off, USA” Danish broadcaster TV2 reported.

Even Greenland's national dogsled race - Avannaata Qimussersu - which kicked off Saturday with some 37 mushers and 444 dogs was not left unaffected. Usha Vance, the vice president's wife, who was originally scheduled to attend the race opted out when her husband decided to join the trip and visit the military base instead, reducing the likelihood that they would cross paths with Greenlanders.

Løkke Rasmussen, in his video, reminded viewers of the 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations on the island, he said, to the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest with some 200 soldiers today.

The 1951 agreement “offers ample opportunity for the United States to have a much stronger military presence in Greenland,” the foreign minister said. “If that is what you wish, then let us discuss it.”

Løkke Rasmussen added that Denmark has increased its own investment into Arctic defense. In January, Denmark announced 14.6 billion Danish kroner (US$2.1 billion) in financial commitments for Arctic security covering three new naval vessels, long-range drones and satellites.

The Taliban leader said Sunday there was no need for Western laws in Afghanistan and that democracy was dead as long as sharia laws are in effect. 

Hibatullah Akhundzada made the comments in a sermon marking the Islamic holiday of Eid Al-Fitr, in the southern city of Kandahar's Eidgah Mosque. The 50-minute audio of his message was published on X by the Taliban government's chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. 

“There is no need for laws that originate from the West. We will create our own laws,” Akhundzada said, speaking in Pashto, while emphasizing the importance of Islamic laws. 

The Taliban's interpretation of sharia has led to bans on Afghan women and girls, who have been excluded them from education, many jobs and most public spaces. Such measures have isolated the Taliban on the world stage, although they have established diplomatic ties with countries including China and the United Arab Emirates. 

Akhundzada has taken a stronger hand in directing policy since the Taliban seized control of the country in 2021, despite some officials initially promising a more moderate rule.

Akhundzada on Sunday criticized the West, saying non-believers had united against Muslims and that the U.S. and others were united in their hostility toward Islam, citing the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

Democracy had come to an end in Afghanistan and sharia was in effect, he said, adding that supporters of democracy were trying to separate the people from the Taliban government. 




The Taliban have no credible opposition inside or outside the country, but some senior figures within the administration have criticized the leadership's decision-making process and concentration of power in Akhundzada's circle. 

Some Taliban want greater engagement with the international community and scrapping harsher policies to attract more outside support. In recent months, however, there has been increased engagement between the Taliban and the U.S. under President Donald Trump, mostly because of prisoner exchanges and releases.

Myanmar's ruling military said Saturday on state television that the confirmed death toll from a devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake rose to 1,644. Collapsed buildings could be seen in Mandalay, the country's No. 2 city, as rescue workers and volunteers tried to recover any possible survivors under rubble.

Crews were seen recovering two more bodies from the site of a collapsed high-rise under construction in Bangkok overnight Saturday after the powerful earthquake which rocked the Thai capital. Nine of the 10 fatalities so far announced in Thailand were at construction site near the city's Chatuchak market, while 78 people were still unaccounted for.

BANGKOK (AP) — A unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts was announced on Saturday by Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government, which coordinates the popular struggle against the ruling military. The country's death toll from the disaster soared to 1,644.

The figure was a sharp rise compared to the 1,002 announced just hours earlier, highlighting the difficulty of confirming casualties over a widespread region and the likelihood that the numbers will continue to grow from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake. The number of injured increased to 3,408, while the missing figure rose to 139.

In neighboring Thailand, the death toll rose to 17. The quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, home to around 17 million people, and other parts of the country. Many places in the north reported damage, but the only casualties were reported in Bangkok. 

Of the death toll, 10 were killed in the high rise building near famous Chatuchak market that collapsed, while the rest were killed in seven other sites. Authorities in Bangkok said 83 people were unaccounted for.

On Saturday, more heavy equipment was brought in to move the tons of rubble, but hope was fading among friends and relatives.

“I was praying that that they had survived, but when I got here and saw the ruin — where could they be?” said 45-year-old Naruemol Thonglek, sobbing as she awaited news about her partner, who is from Myanmar, and five friends who worked at the site.

In Myanmar, rescue efforts so far are focused on the major stricken cities of Mandalay, the country's No. 2 city, and Naypyitaw, the capital. 

But even though teams and equipment have been flown in from other nations, they are hindered by damage to airports. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show that the earthquake toppled the air traffic control tower at Naypyitaw International Airport as if sheered from its base.

It wasn't immediately clear if there had been any casualties from its collapse.

Another major complication is the civil war roiling much of the country, including the quake-affected areas. In 2021, the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has since turned into significant armed resistance.

Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations.

The interplay of politics and disaster was demonstrated Saturday night, when Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government announced a unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts. 

It said its armed wing, the People's Defense Force, will implement a two-week pause in offensive military operations starting Sunday in earthquake-affected areas and it would also collaborate with the U.N. and international nongovernmental organizations “to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps,” in the areas it controls.

The resistance organization said it reserved the right to fight back in defense if attacked.

The earthquake struck midday Friday with an epicenter not far from Mandalay, followed by several aftershocks, including one measuring 6.4. It sent buildings in many areas toppling to the ground, buckled roads and caused bridges to collapse.

In Naypyitaw, crews worked Saturday to repair damaged roads, while electricity, phone and internet services remained down for most of the city. The earthquake brought down many buildings, including multiple units that housed government civil servants, but that section of the city was blocked off by authorities on Saturday.

An initial report on earthquake relief efforts issued Saturday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that it's allocating $5 million from a Central Emergency Response Fund for “life-saving assistance.”

The immediate planned measures include a convoy of 17 cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies from China that is expected to arrive on Sunday, it said.

It noted the severe damage or destruction of many health facilities, and warned of a “severe shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers.”

Myanmar's friends and neighbors have already brought in rescue personnel and relief materials. China and Russia are the largest suppliers of weapons to Myanmar's military, and were among the first to step in with humanitarian aid.

In a country where prior governments sometimes have been slow to accept foreign aid, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, head of the military government, said that Myanmar was ready to accept outside assistance. 

China said it has sent more than 135 rescue personnel and experts along with supplies like medical kits and generators, and pledged around $13.8 million in emergency aid. Russia's Emergencies Ministry said that it had flown in 120 rescuers and supplies, and the country's Health Ministry said Moscow had sent a medical team to Myanmar.

Other countries like India, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore are also sending help, and U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that Washington was going to help with the response.

The ceasefire plan announced by the opposition National Unity Government also proposed to provide health care professionals loyal to its resistance movement to work with international humanitarian organizations to deliver emergency rescue and medical services in areas under the military's control, if provided with safety guarantees.

The military has heavily restricted much-needed aid efforts to the large population already displaced by war even before the earthquake. Sympathizers of the resistance have urged that relief efforts incorporate aid freely transported to areas under the control of the resistance, so it can't be weaponized by the army.

There was no immediate comment by the military to the announcement.

Military forces continued their attacks even after the quake, with three airstrikes in northern Kayin state, also called Karenni state, and southern Shan — both of which border Mandalay state, said Dave Eubank, a former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier who founded the Free Burma Rangers, a private aid organization.

Eubank told the AP that in the area he was operating in, most villages have already been destroyed by the military so the earthquake had little impact.

“People are in the jungle and I was out in the jungle when the earthquake hit — it was powerful, but the trees just moved, that was it for us, so we haven't had a direct impact other than that the Burma army keeps attacking, even after the quake,” he said.

Earthquakes are rare in Bangkok, but relatively common in Myanmar. The country sits on the Sagaing Fault, a major north-south fault that separates the India plate and the Sunda plate.

Brian Baptie, a seismologist with the British Geological Survey, said that the quake caused intense ground shaking in an area where most of the population lives in buildings constructed of timber and unreinforced brick masonry.

“When you have a large earthquake in an area where there are over a million people, many of them living in vulnerable buildings, the consequences can often be disastrous,” he said in a statement.

David Rising and Jerry Harmer in Bangkok, Simina Mistreanu in Taipei, Tong-hyung Kim in Seoul, South Korea, and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.

This story has been corrected to show that the military seized power in 2021, not 2001.

Iran's president says his country has officially informed the U.S that it rejects direct negotiations. President Masould Pezeshkian told a cabinet meeting on Sunday that Iran's response to US President Donald Trump's letter had been delivered to a U.S contact in Oman.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's president said Sunday that the Islamic Republic rejected direct negotiations with the United States over its rapidly advancing nuclear program, offering Tehran's first response to a letter that U.S. President Donald Trump sent to the country's supreme leader. 

President Masoud Pezeshkian said that Iran's response, delivered via the sultanate of Oman, left open the possibility of indirect negotiations with Washington. However, such talks have made no progress since Trump in his first term unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. 

In the years since, regional tensions have boiled over into attacks at sea and on land. Then came the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, which saw Israel target militant group leaders across Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance.” Now, as the U.S. conducts intense airstrikes targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels of Yemen, the risk of military action targeting Iran's nuclear program remains on the table. 

“We don't avoid talks; it's the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far,” Pezeshkian said in televised remarks during a Cabinet meeting. “They must prove that they can build trust.”

The U.S. State Department, responding to Pezeshkian, said that “President Trump has been clear: the United States cannot allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.”




“The president expressed his willingness to discuss a deal with Iran,” it added. “If the Iranian regime does not want a deal, the president is clear, he will pursue other options, which will be very bad for Iran.”

Trump said before Pezeshkian's comments that he was considering military action and secondary tariffs, if Iran doesn't agree to a nuclear deal. 

“If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before,” Trump said in a comment aired Sunday by NBC News.

Having Pezeshkian announce the decision shows just how much has changed in Iran, since his election a half-year ago after he campaigned on a promise to reengage with the West. 

Since Trump's election and the resumption of his “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran, Iran's rial currency has gone into a freefall. Pezeshkian had left open discussions up until Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei came down hard on Trump in February and warned talks “are not intelligent, wise or honorable” with his administration. The Iranian president then immediately toughened his own remarks on the U.S.

Meanwhile, there have been mixed messages coming from Iran for weeks. Videos from Quds, or Jerusalem, Day demonstrations on Friday had people in the crowds instructing participants to only shout: “Death to Israel!” Typically, “Death to America” was also heard. 

A video of an underground missile base unveiled by Iran's hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard also showed its troops stepping on an Israeli flag painted on the ground — though there was no American flag as often seen in such propaganda videos.

But Press TV, the English-language arm of Iranian state television, published an article last week that included listing U.S. bases in the Middle East as possible targets of attack. The list included Camp Thunder Cove on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, where the U.S. is basing stealth B-2 bombers likely being used in Yemen. 

“The Americans themselves know how vulnerable they are,” warned Iranian parliamentary speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Friday. “If they violate Iran's sovereignty, it will be like a spark in a gunpowder depot, setting the entire region ablaze. In such a scenario, their bases and their allies will not be safe.”

However, Tehran's two recent direct attacks on Israel with ballistic missiles and drones caused negligible damage, while Israel responded by destroying Iranian air defense systems.

Trump's letter arrived in Tehran on March 12. Though announcing that he wrote it in a television interview, Trump offered little detail on what he exactly told the supreme leader. 

“I've written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you're going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing,'” Trump said in the interview.

The move recalled Trump's letter-writing to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in his first term, which led to face-to-face meetings, but no deals to limit Pyongyang's atomic bombs and a missile program capable of reaching the continental U.S.

The last time that Trump tried to send a letter to Khamenei, through the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2019, the supreme leader mocked the effort.

Trump's letter came as both Israel and the United States have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels of 60% purity — something only done by atomic-armed nations.

Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb. A report in February, however, by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, said that Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium.

Iran's reluctance to deal with Trump likely also takes root in his ordering the attack that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a Baghdad drone strike in January 2020. The U.S. has said Iran plotted to assassinate Trump over that prior to his election this November, something Tehran denied though officials have threatened him.

        Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr with prayers and gatherings, marking the end of Ramadan. In Gaza, Palestinians have little to celebrate as the war continues despite ceasefire efforts.
    

Muslims around the world bid farewell to the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and celebrated the holiday of Eid al-Fitr on Sunday. 

As every year, Eid was greeted with joy and excitement as Muslims marked with congregational prayers and festivities that typically include family visits, gatherings and new clothes.

In Jerusalem, thousands of Palestinians gathered on Sunday at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City for Eid al-Fitr prayers. 

In Serbia, the Islamic community held its central Eid ceremony in the Arab mosque in Novi Pazar, also marking the occasion with communal prayers. 

In the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, Muslims gathered in outdoor prayer spaces. Families donned new clothes and visited loved ones, blending tradition with modern festivities. 

Meanwhile, in Islam's holiest city of Mecca, millions of pilgrims and locals joined in mass prayers at the Grand Mosque, underscoring the spiritual heart of the celebration.

Elsewhere in the Middle East, Syrians celebrate their first Eid al-Fitr since the end of more than half a century of being ruled by the al-Assad family. 

Like Ramadan and other Muslim observances, the timing of Muslim months and holidays generally depends on the lunar cycle, specifically the sighting of the Moon's crescent following the new Moon. 

In many parts of the world, dedicated teams of moon-sighters will scan the sky with telescopes and binoculars, hoping to catch a glimpse of the elusive crescent moon.

For some Muslims, this year's Eid was far from a joyous occasion as their communities are ravaged by war.

Residents of the Gaza Strip are observing their second Eid al-Fitr since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas.

They had little to celebrate on Sunday, as they marked a normally festive holiday with rapidly dwindling food supplies and no end in sight to the conflict. 

Israeli strikes overnight into Sunday killed at least 19 people, mostly women and children, according to officials of the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza.

Israel put an abrupt end to its ceasefire with Hamas this month as waves of strikes killed hundreds in the enclave. Meanwhile, food, fuel, medicine and other supplies have been halted.

“It's the Eid of sadness,” said Adel al-Shaer after attending outdoor prayers in the central town of Deir al-Balah. “We lost our loved ones, our children, our lives, and our futures. We lost our students, our schools, and our institutions. We lost everything.”

        Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian spoke in response to a letter sent to the country's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei by US President Donald Trump earlier this month.
    

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Sunday that the Islamic Republic is ruling out direct negotiations with the US on its nuclear programme.

""We don't avoid talks,"" Pezeshkian said in televised remarks during a cabinet meeting. ""It's the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far. They must prove that they can build trust.”

Pezeshkian was speaking in response to a letter sent by US President Donald Trump to Tehran on 12 March, the exact contents of which were not revealed.

Iran's reply, which was delivered to the US through the sultanate of Oman, did however leave the door open for potential indirect negotiations with Washington.

The White House did not offer an immediate response to the Iranian president's remarks, but in an interview with NBC that aired on the same day but was recorded just prior to Tehran's comments, Trump said ""If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.""

Earlier this month, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi dismissed the prospect of direct negotiations, noting that so long as Washington maintains its heavy sanctions on Tehran, no nuclear negotiations or cooperation can take place.

“We will not enter any direct negotiations with the US so long as they continue their maximum pressure policy and their threats,” said the Iranian FM.

The Trump administration has reimposed sanctions against Iran – including on the country's oil sector – as part of his maximum pressure policy designed to cripple the Iranian economy and force the government into diplomatic submission.

In a speech in August, Supreme Leader Khamenei opened the door to talks with the US, saying there is “no harm in engaging with the enemy”. However, more recently, he's backtracked stating that negotiations with Washington are “not intelligent, wise or honourable”, after Trump floated the prospect of nuclear talks.

        Authorities in the Czech Republic's Olomouc region declare a state of emergency a month after a train derailment caused what they called the world's largest benzene contamination of its kind.
    

Czech officials declared a state of emergency in the vicinity of Hustopeče nad Bečvou in the Přerov region due to the spread of toxic benzene following a train crash on 28 February.

Olomouc Governor Ladislav Okleštěk declared the emergency after the toxic substance had already completely contaminated the nearby lake. He says the order was needed to enable faster remediation of the contaminated soil and water.

""We have unanimously agreed to declare a state of emergency as of 12:00 today in the Olomouc Region,"" said Okleštěk.

A state of emergency grants special powers to the implementing county's administration. Local officials are given the right of imposing a work obligation, make decisions on work assistance or enable the provision of material resources to deal with the crisis.

The local county can also immediately carry out construction work and landscaping, or prohibit the entry, stay and movement of people in a defined place or area until the crisis is mitigated.

Czech Environment Minister Petr Hladik said the situation was rapidly deteriorating at the accident site and action urgently needed to be taken within hours. He added that the first benzene-affected water well appeared in the area within hours, stressing the need to immediately tackle the emergency to protect drinking water sources.

Work to extract benzene from water sources is already underway. Professionals have been tasked with digging dozens of remediation pits between railroad tracks and the affected lake. Larsen walls are also being installed, at depths of seven metres to prevent further spread of benzene.

“180 metres of the Larsen Wall is now complete I don't want to speak for the company that is doing it now, so as not to give any misinformation, but I have information that 25 - 30 metres are being built by these guys every day, so they are doing an excellent job,” said Radek Buryánek, Spokesperson of the Olomouc Regional Fire Brigade.

“The Larsen walls certainly help in terms of reducing the concentration of benzene that is pushed through the bedrock into that lake,” he added.

“As far as the next thing is concerned, there will certainly be at least 210 metres of Larsen walls built in that first phase, and there is the possibility that more Larsen walls will be built, and that basically the whole area of the accident should be bypassed by those Larsen walls.""

The state of emergency comes a month after a freight train derailed at the entrance of the Hustopeče station, in what authorities suspected was due to high speed.

Most of the 17 carriages immediately caught fire after the accident. Some 350 tonnes of benzene leaked from the tankers carrying 1,020 tonnes, much of it into the groundwater.

The damage expected by the benzene tanker fire is expected to be around CZK 1 billion (€40.1 million), according to Okleštěk. The state of emergency order is valid for one month, through to 27 April.

        The death toll from the earthquake that hit Myanmar on Friday has claimed the lives of at least 1,644 people and injured 2,376, according to the country's ruling military junta.
    

Myanmar's main resistance movement to the country's military junta has announced a unilateral partial ceasefire in order to aid rescue efforts after a 7.7 earthquake struck the country on Friday.

The Shadow National Unity Government, which coordinates the struggle against the ruling military junta which came to power in 2021, has said its armed wing, the People's Defence Force (PDF) will cease offensive military operations from Sunday in areas affected by the earthquake.

The death toll in Myanmar from Friday's magnitude 7.7 earthquake has risen to 1,644, the AFP news agency quoting the ruling military junta has said.

The quake rocked central Myanmar's city of Mandalay around midday local time, causing extensive damage across a wide swath of one of the world's poorest countries.

Authorities say 2,376 have been injured, and 30 others are missing.

The full extent of the death, injury and destruction was not immediately clear – particularly in Myanmar, which is embroiled in a civil war, and where information is tightly controlled.

“The death toll and injuries are expected to rise,” the head of Myanmar's military government, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing said as he announced on television the latest death toll.

        Anagrama says it will respect a public prosecutor's recent opinion and refrain from selling the controversial book. Ruth Ortiz, the mother of the murdered children, has denounced Bretón for a possible breach of his sentence.
    

The publishing house Anagrama has announced that it is ceasing distribution of ""El odio"" (The hate), an epistolary novel based on a series of conversations between its author, Luis García Martín, and José Bretón, who was convicted of the murder of his two children.

The Barcelona-based publisher has taken this decision just two days after a lower court refused to block the publication in the face of the precautionary measures requested by the Public Prosecutor's Office for Minors.

The complaint was filed in Córdoba by Ruth Ortiz, Bretón's ex-partner and mother of the children they had in common, who were murdered by him in 2011.

Bretón killed Ruth and José, aged 2 and 6, just one month after his then partner told him of her intention to divorce him, in a harsh example of vicarious violence.  He was convicted in 2013 of double murder with aggravating circumstances due to kinship, premeditation and the ruthlessness demonstrated in the execution of the acts.

He was sentenced to 40 years in prison; 20 years for each murdered child, although his total sentence was later reduced to 25 years. He is being held in a maximum security prison in the town of Herrera de la Mancha in Ciudad Real, La Mancha.

In its press release, Anagrama says it respects the appeal filed by the Public Prosecutor's Office against the recent court ruling and is suspending the book's distribution indefinitely.

""The publishing house expresses the absolute respect that Ruth Ortiz deserves and regrets the pain that the information disclosed about the publication and distribution of the book may have caused her,"" the statement reads.

""Anagrama believes that, in a democratic society, there must be a balance between creative freedom as a fundamental right and the protection of victims. Works that are inspired by real events, as is the case with 'El odio', require a double dose of responsibility and respect.

""That is why, in an exercise of prudence and on a voluntary basis, the publisher has decided to maintain the suspension of the distribution of the work indefinitely"".

Ortiz, who learned of the book's contents from the media, was not contacted during the creative process to include her testimony or give her consent to it.

The Andalusian Public Prosecutor's Office has reported that Ortiz's lawyer has denounced Bretón for a possible breach of his sentence.

The lawyer and her client argue that the comments made by the media about the content of the book could constitute this offence.

Euronews has contacted Luis García Martín, known as Luisgé, to get his version of events following the publisher's announcement. The author referred all communication to Anagrama's spokespeople.

        The IDF says it has expanded its ground offensive in the southern Gaza Strip, with troops advancing deeper into Rafah as they look to expand a buffer zone along the borders of the enclave.
    

The Israeli military has announced an escalation of its ground offensive in the southern region of the Gaza Strip late on Saturday.

Forces have advanced into the al-Jenine neighbourhood of Rafah as part of their initiative to create a buffer zone to “expand the security area” along the borders.

The IDF says its troops are continuing to successfully dismantle Hamas infrastructure and targets elsewhere in Gaza. In a post on X, they announced that several Hamas targets, including weapons depots, rocket launchers and buildings serving as military outposts were destroyed.

They added that the strikes also killed several Hamas fighters and combatants associated with the Gaza-based group.

Meanwhile, Hamas announced on Friday that it had accepted a new ceasefire proposal from mediators Qatar and Egypt. Israel on the other hand noted that it had offered a counter-proposal in “full coordination” with the third mediator – the United States.

Egypt early in the week made a proposal to get the troubled ceasefire back on track, following Israel's surprise resumption of fighting. It was not immediately clear whether the proposal changed before Khalil al-Hayyah, the leader of Hamas, announced it had been accepted.

An Egyptian official described the proposal to The Associated Press, saying Hamas would release five living hostages – including an American-Israeli – from Gaza in return for Israel allowing aid into the territory, a weekslong pause in fighting and freeing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave no further details about their counter-proposal, which it said was offered after Netanyahu held consultations on Friday.

Israel resumed its offensive on Gaza almost two weeks ago after it ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of air strikes, killing hundreds of people.

Netanyahu has vowed to escalate the violence until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds – 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel also wants Hamas to disarm, give up power and send its leaders into exile.

Hamas says it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal from the enclave and a lasting ceasefire to end more than 15-months of fighting.

The war on Gaza has killed more than 50,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry does not specify how many were civilians or combatants, but a UN study has revealed that close to 70% of deaths they've been able to verify were women and children.

The leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah group, Naim Kassem, warned on Saturday that if Israel's attacks on Lebanon continue and the Lebanese state does not act to stop them, the group will eventually resort to other alternatives.

Naim Kassem's comments came a day after Israel launched an attack on Lebanon's capital for the first time since a ceasefire ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in November.

The strike on Beirut came hours after two rockets were fired from Lebanon toward Israel and Hezbollah denied it fired them. There was no immediate response from Israeli officials.

Israeli forces were meant to fully withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January, while Hezbollah had to end their military presence south of the Litani River alone the border with Israel under the US-brokered ceasefire that ended the 14-month Israeli-Hezbollah war.

The deadline was extended to 18 February, but Israel has remained in five border locations while carrying out dozens of strikes on what it said were Hezbollah targets in southern and eastern Lebanon.

“We fully complied and we have no presence south of the Litani but Israel did not abide. Israel is carrying aggressions every day,” Kassem said in his televised speech Saturday night.

Last week, Israeli airstrikes on several locations in Lebanon killed six people while an airstrike on a southern village on Friday killed three and wounded 18, most of them women and children.

“Our patience so far aims to give a chance to solutions that could reduce the pains and casualties,” Kassem said.

        İmamoğlu, widely seen as the main political challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 22-year rule,  was jailed on 23 March pending trial on corruption charges.
    

Hundreds of thousands of protesters have congregated in Istanbul to how their support for the city's imprisoned mayor and demand his release.

Turkey's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP) organised the demonstration, the latest in a series of protests that have resulted in hundreds of arrests and have dialled up the pressure on the country's long-time leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, a key political rival to Erdoğan, was detained on 19 March on corruption and terrorism charges that many saw as politically motivated.

The government insists the judiciary is independent and free of political interference.

His detention, and later formal arrest on corruption charges on 23 March, sparked nationwide protests despite assembly bans, police crackdowns and legal prosecution by authorities.

""They've detained hundreds of our children, thousands of our youths... arrested hundreds of them,"" CHP leader Özgür Özel told protesters.

""They only had one goal in mind: to intimidate them, terrify them, make sure they never go out again.""

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on Thursday that nearly 1,900 people had been detained since 19 March and pro-government media reported on Friday that public prosecutors had requested up to three years imprisonment for 74 of the detainees.

Police kept their distance at Saturday's rally with no new arrests reported.

Özel called for the immediate release of İmamoğlu, as well as for other political prisoners including Selahattin Demirtaş, a former presidential candidate and founder of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM).

""In the Turkey we envision, presidential candidates will not be imprisoned,"" added Özel.

Last Sunday, hours after he had been formally arrested, İmamoğlu won a symbolic primary to be the CHP's candidate in a presidential election currently scheduled for 2028, but which is likely to take place earlier.

Özel noted they would begin collecting signatures for İmamoğlu's release and also to demand an early election.

        The Château de Versailles is honouring an overlooked heritage — and the highly symbolic role played by the former royal residence in the life of French democracy even today.
    

""You're always discovering new things with Versailles, it's never-ending!"" enthuses Martine at the start of our tour.

The guide has been wandering the countless aisles of the château for 15 years now, but according to her, there are still many secrets to be revealed behind the thick walls.

Among them, the Salle du Congrès and the president's apartment, open to the public... But first things first.

Our visit begins under the gilding of the Royal Opera House, a place steeped in history and elegance. It was here that Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette celebrated their wedding in 1770.

A century later, the parliamentarians of the Third French Republic (1870-1940) held their meetings here.

As the popular uprising set France ablaze, the château of the kings became a refuge for the republicans. Quite a symbol.

It is precisely this transition — both architectural and political — that is at the heart of a unique tour now available to the public to mark the 150th anniversary of the Wallon amendment.

This was the text that gave birth to the Senate and the National Assembly and introduced the election of the President by these two chambers. The Third Republic, until then a provisional regime, was then ratified.

""This is a somewhat forgotten episode in our political history,"" explains Christophe Leribault, President of the Château. ""This visit gives us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on the still little-known Versailles of the 19th century.""

The immense hemicycle known as the Salle du Congrès, built in 1875 to accommodate this new parliament, contrasts sharply with the Versailles of the Sun King. Gone are the lilies on a blue background, replaced by red velvet armchairs.

""We didn't expect to see this here at all,"" says Capucine. ""It's a modern touch, and we look at the château differently,"" adds her mother, Florence.

For the first time, the flat of the president of the Congress was also unveiled. This is where the ballot papers for the presidential election were counted. Fifteen presidents were elected at Versailles until 1954.

This flat is now used on rare occasions by the presidents of the National Assembly and the Senate.

Although MPs and senators eventually left Versailles to move back to Paris in 1879, the Third Republic left its lasting mark on the château.

It was only in the Versailles hemicycle that the French President could convene Parliament. It is here that the Constitution is enriched, as it was on 4 March 2024 whenwomen's right to an abortion was enshrined in the constitution.

""It was my first day as President of the Château, and the place was buzzing with MPs, senators and journalists. That convinced me that these rooms had to be opened, because Versailles is more than just the Hall of Mirrors; it's a mecca of power and French history"", recalls Christophe Leribault.

Some 8.4 million people visited the château last year. Of these, 80% were foreign tourists, and the President of the château is on a mission to change that.

""It's important to open other rooms so that French and Parisian visitors want to come back to Versailles,"" he says. ""It's great that there are visitors from all over the world, but it's also important that this heritage remains ours"".

Could this also be an opportunity to reconcile the French with a controversial site?

Over the years, the Château de Versailles has become an invaluable tool and backdrop for French diplomacy. But it is also a politically dangerous place.

President Emmanuel Macron regularly pays the price for using it, and has been criticised for receiving heads of state and multinational bosses there with great fanfare.

""It can give off a rather blinged-out and haughty image, disconnected from reality,"" confides Denis, a regular visitor to the château.

That's the paradox of Versailles: a symbol of monarchical and republican power alike, at once reviled for its opulence and admired for its magnificence.

These fascinating and very French contradictions are brought to light in this original tour retracing 150 years of republican history.

The exhibition is open to the public every weekend, with guided tours on weekdays until the end of September.

        The hit Netflix series Adolescence has fueled discussion about banning social media and smartphones for children. But experts warn a ban won't work.
    

""The hatred of women is everywhere and dictates the way men behave online,"" one young Gen Z person said in a recent poll when asked about misogyny on social media, while a young man said, ""it isn't that deep. It's all a laugh"". 

According to the Amnesty International survey released this week, 73 per cent of Gen Z social media users (those aged 13-28) in the UK have witnessed misogynistic content online, with half encountering it every week. 

The poll comes as social media has been placed under an even brighter spotlight following the release of the Netflix drama Adolescence, which follows the fictional story of the social media-fuelled murder of a schoolgirl by a 13-year-old boy. 

The show's co-creator Jack Thorne has called on the UK government to ban smartphones for those under 16, following a similar move made by Australia to ban social media for the same age range.

However, experts warn that a ban does not get to the root of the problem. 

There is no current data to suggest that banning social media for under 16s works. 

The most recent study published in Lancet Regional Health Europe - and the first of its kind - looked at the impact of smartphone bans in schools across England and found that they made no difference to mental well-being, sleep, or educational outcomes.

The study was limited in that it only evaluated bans during school hours and not an outright prohibition, as some countries have suggested.

However, restricting smartphone use until the age of 16 may not work either as it may be too late for children to be educated about the harms of social media. 

""Currently, it does look like the age of 16 is the age at which a child is allowed full access to social media. So you've got to think, what happens when a child is 15 years and 364 days old,"" said Drew Benvie, the founder of the social media campaign group Raise, which works with children to educate them about the harms of social media. 

Another issue, he told Euronews Next, is that ""children always find a way"" to get around bans and parental restrictions. 

""I think banning social media for an age group has inherent risks. It's going to be incredibly difficult to enforce, and even if it's possible, users will find a way to bypass it,"" he said, pointing out that children are using VPNs to get around the TikTok ban in the United States. 

He argued that bans would likely see messaging apps replacing social media and that there is a potential risk for them to be more harmful because the content “goes dark and can't be seen by others,"" such as parents. 

The most prolific misogynistic influencer is Andrew Tate, who blends get-rich-quick tips with misogyny, saying that women belong at home and that rape victims must ""bear responsibility for their attacks"". 

In the last month, 57 per cent of Gen Z men in the UK reported that they'd seen content from Elon Musk, US President Donald Trump (55 per cent), and Andrew Tate (41 per cent), according to the Amnesty International report.  

""The influence of toxic masculinity on young boys and how it's affecting their behaviour towards young girls. I think that does scare me the most about all of this,"" said Benvie, who added that education is just part of the solution. 

For their part, social media companies have taken some steps to make their platforms safer for children. 

TikTok introduced a new mindfulness tool that automatically turns on for teenagers under 16 after 10 pm and will interrupt the ""For You"" feed with a full-screen takeover, play calming music, and activate blue light. 

It also has new controls that allow parents to block teenagers from TikTok during specific times. 

Other platforms allow parents to block their children's social media use in the evening, and Meta has also introduced teen accounts for Instagram that give parents greater control. 

The mindfulness tool by TikTok ""can help a little bit, but really only a little bit. If teens use it maybe they will turn off for a bit and get a better night's sleep, or they will use it when they see something,"" said Sonia Livingstone, professor of social psychology, department of media and communications at the London School of Economics. 

""The very fact of providing it will communicate something about the value of being more mindful and being more, as psychologists would say, kind of self-regulating, taking a bit more control of their own engagement instead of just feeling taken over by the app,"" she told Euronews Next. 

As for parental controls, she said that she has researched them and found that the controls should be reached through a consensus in the family, not just imposed by the parent.

""Anything imposed high-handed by the parent tends to get rejected or resented by the child, or they find a workaround,"" Livingstone said, adding that replacing the word control would also be a good move so that children feel less dictated to. 

Although these measures give parents greater control, social media platforms can amplify misogynistic content. The longer the user stays on a video and the more popular it becomes, the more similar types of videos are promoted by the algorithm. 

A study last year found that there was a four-fold increase in the level of misogynistic content, which TikTok suggested when it was monitored by researchers over five days. 

The algorithm showed more extreme videos, which, for the most part, focused on anger and blame directed at women. 

The study by University College London and the University of Kent in the UK focused solely on TikTok, but the researchers said the findings were likely similar to what other social media platforms offer.

The researchers also said that an total restriction of phones or social media was ""likely to be ineffective,"" and instead called for a “healthy digital diet” and for the tech companies to look into their algorithms. 

The other way social media companies can act is to be quicker at removing content when it is reported as offensive, said Livingstone. 

""Children say to me a lot that they want a much better way of reporting and taking down the content,"" said Livingstone. 

""I've had children say we report things such as beheadings and it took TikTok two hours to take it down,"" she said, adding that two hours is fast for a social media platform, but in that period, it has already been shared on other platforms and been screenshot many times. 

When it comes to misogyny, ""it needs to be caught much faster than it currently is,"" said Benvie. 

Illegal content on social media is classified, for instance as child sexual exploitation or graphic content, but misogyny is easy to go undetected for a long period.  

""It could be dressed up as attractive to impressionable minds, and it needs to be detected faster. It needs to be removed faster,"" said Benvie. 

""And those pushing it need to face sanctions as well as the social networks. And that's only part of the solution,"" he added. 

While controversial influencer Tate has been banned from Meta, TikTok, and YouTube, his content continued to be posted on these platforms by others for quite some time. 

Another point Benvie makes is that misogynistic posts from profiles that are not as known as Tate may go undetected for a while, as children will not bring up these posts or profiles with their parents or teachers. 

""That's when it will make an impact, and it will affect a child in quite a harmful way. I think if it's [misogyny] better understood, it can be more quickly dealt with as an issue,"" he said. 

Benvie argues this is where education needs to come in, which would talk to children about the issues of misogyny, teach digital literacy, and talk about disinformation and fake news.  

He said that parents can also help with education and that the best way to do so is for parents to use the apps themselves to understand them and talk to their children about worrisome content they may have seen, as children will not bring up the content themselves. 

However, Benvie said that education alone cannot fill the gap and that action needs to be taken by regulators and social media companies.

Regulation, education, and enforcement of social media safety needs to happen faster, and the social networks know they need to change or else they face a ban, he said. 

""It's a shame that facing a ban is bringing about such quick action. But at least we're going in the right direction, because I don't think outright bans are practicable and therefore they won't work,"" he said. 

""They will help, but they're not the solution because at some point a child comes online and we need to equip them with the skills for life online, not prevent them from accessing the reality of life"".

Scientists have recently uncovered a wondrous and vibrant underwater world, previously hidden beneath a massive glacier in Antarctica.The glacier, covering an area of about 510 sq.km. — roughly three and a half times the size of Tel Aviv-Yafo —detached from the George VI Ice Shelf in January 2025, revealing a thriving seafloor never before seen by humans.  Among the fascinating creatures discovered were icefish, giant sea spiders, and octopuses — evidence of the astonishing biodiversity that endures even under the most extreme conditions.The enormous glacier, now named A-84, broke away from the ice shelf in the Bellingshausen Sea—a marginal sea of the Southern Ocean along the western edge of the Antarctic Peninsula — while scientists were aboard the research vessel R/V Falkor, operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute.

Over the course of eight days, the team explored the seafloor at depths reaching 1,300m. using an advanced underwater robot named ROV SuBastian. They discovered large coral reefs and sponge fields teeming with marine life — a thriving ecosystem that had managed to flourish despite the extreme cold and darkness.Antarctica's floating ice shelves hang over the sea like massive platforms, making access to the seafloor beneath them a major challenge for scientists. Typically, deep-sea creatures depend on organic matter sinking from the sunlit upper layers of the ocean.   Stay updated with the latest news!

Defense Minister Israel Katz appointed Col. (res) Yaakov (Kobi) Blitstein, currently Defense Ministry deputy director-general, as the head of the Directorate for the Voluntary Emigration of Gaza Residents, the ministry announced on Sunday.Blitstein previously served as director-general of the foreign ministry and energy ministry, respectively, acting director-general of the finance ministry, head of national infrastructure at the finance ministry, and deputy director-general for planning and infrastructure development at the transportation ministry.Blitstein holds a BA in economics, political science, and sociology from Bar-Ilan University, a second BA in law from Ono Academic College, and an MBA from Tel Aviv University. He is also a licensed attorney.  The directorate, which was established a week ago, will operate under the authority of the defense minister and is authorized to coordinate with international organizations and other relevant bodies, as well as all relevant government ministries.The directorate's task is to prepare for, and facilitate the safe and supervised ""voluntary emigration of Gaza residents to third countries, including securing their transit, establishing a designated pedestrian route and checkpoint infrastructure in Gaza, and coordinating the necessary infrastructure for land, sea, and air exits to destination countries,"" the ministry clarified.PALESTINIANS MAKE their way between southern and northern Gaza on Sunday after Israeli forces withdrew from the Netzarim Corridor.  (credit: Dawoud Abu Alkas/Reuters)Israel Katz statementDefense Minister Israel Katz stated, ""We are determined to realize the vision of US President Donald Trump to enable the voluntary emigration of Gaza residents who wish to relocate to various parts of the world.""Our assessments indicate that at least 40% of Gaza's population wants to emigrate,"" Katz added. ""The appointment of Kobi Blitstein as head of the directorate will provide organizational momentum for all necessary actions, alongside significant diplomatic efforts to identify destination countries—already underway with the US administration and directly led by a team under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,” Katz expanded.

A team of researchers from the University of Jaén identified the first known stone mold for making coins in all of Hispania at the ancient settlement of Obulco, known today as Porcuna, Jaén,.The object found is one half of a bivalve mold, used to produce unstruck metal discs (known as cospeles) that would later be hammered into coins. The mold measured 11 cm in height, 13.7 cm in length, and 5.4 cm in width. Its flat surface revealed circular casting marks created by the pouring of molten metal, indicating its role in the ancient coin-making process, according to Arkeo News.  The mold holds particular historical significance as it provides detailed insights into the technical aspects of coin production, specifically the bronze ases dated to between 189 and 165 BCE. This series is linked to one of the earliest coin series issued by Obulco. An analysis involving X-ray fluorescence spectrometry confirmed the metallic impressions within the mold to be of a binary copper-lead alloy, consistent with compositions identified in coins from Obulco.The mold was constructed using local stone from the Porcuna area, an analysis pointed out by labrujulaverde.com. This finding emphasizes the use of local resources in industrial tool-making during antiquity, an integral aspect of economic activities which complemented the growing influence of Roman administrative practices within indigenous communities. AdvertisementThe discovery provides tangible evidence of production workshops in Iberia. It fills a long-standing archaeological gap regarding the visibility of Iberian mints.The archaeological site of Obulco was a significant Ibero-Roman settlement, prominent for its strategic location along trade routes and active minting operations. It played a crucial role in the economy of Republican Hispania. Its coinage, tagged with names of local magistrates inscribed in both Iberian and Latin, bore symbols including plows, wheat ears, and yokes, reflecting the agricultural foundation of the local economy. Coinage was central to the Romanization of the Iberian Peninsula, serving as a critical link between local communities and the broader Roman economic system. This integration into the Roman framework is symbolized by the iconography on the coins which combined local and Roman influences. Researchers have long believed that minting workshops were frequently situated in peripheral areas under local magistrates or military control rather than urban centers, a theory supported by similar findings in Carteia and confirmed by recent analysis, according to labrujulaverde.com.The increasing monetary production in the region coincided with a broader extractive economic system of the Roman Republic, fostering a territorial reorganization and the expansion of cereal agriculture.

Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli's International Conference on Combating Antisemitism this past Thursday should have been an event to celebrate Israel's government making a stand against antisemitism. It should have been an opportunity for people from all over the world to come together in Israel and discuss how best to combat antisemitism since October 7.And October 7 is a crucial point.  The Hamas attacks changed everything, not just in Israel but for Jews worldwide.In the three months post-Oct. 7, US antisemitic incidents skyrocketed to a total of 3,291 between October 7 and January 7, according to the Anti-Defamation League, representing a whopping 361% increase from the same period the year prior. AdvertisementHowever, the conference ended up a farce – beginning weeks prior to its doors even opening.A protester attend the annual al-Quds Day, in London, Britain, March 23, 2025 (credit: REUTERS/JAIMI JOY)Anti-Israel forces spread lies about the right-wing European politicians who attended the conference, Chikli said in a speech at the Thursday convention. He thanked the politicians who had attended the conference, which had bled high-profile participants since the announcement of the attendance list.Chikli's responseThe campaign of pressure was led by Haaretz, according to Chikli, who continued to lambast it as an anti-Israel “beacon of lies” that doesn't represent the Jewish people. Hebrew University of Jerusalem Prof. Gadi Taub also slammed the newspaper during the panel entitled “progressivism fell captive to antisemitism,” declaring it to be “antisemitic.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Chikli's message was reiterated by Israeli-Canadian businessman and philanthropist Sylvan Adams. Critics of the International Conference on Combating Antisemitism are too focused on politics, advised the World Jewish Congress Israel Region president in his speech, encouraging those who withdrew from the conference to engage in dialogue so that the right- and left-wing of politics could stand together against antisemitism. Advertisement“I disagree with the critics of this conference, who complained about the speaker list,” said Adams, in reference to the controversy over the attendance of far-right European politicians. “I think that they are too focused on politics, whether someone is left- or right-leaning and labeled an extremist.”The list of attendees was notably right-leaning. Also notable was the list of people who pulled out of associating with the conference – including the UK's apolitical Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, along with organizations who make combating antisemitism their bread and butter, such as the Anti-Defamation League.In an attempt to stem the tide of officials boycotting the conference, Herzog offered a compromise: a private meeting with world Jewish leaders at his home the night before the main event, without those controversial figures (which the Post attended).  Politicians from across Europe attended Chikli's gathering. But one who was supposed to – Milorad Dodik, president of Republika Srpska, the Serb-majority entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina – was disinvited after an international arrest warrant was issued just hours before he was scheduled to speak.France's National Rally leader, Jordan Bardella, told those gathered that the best option to defend French Jews against Islamism and radical leftism was his party, committing France to fight antisemitism as defined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition.“National Rally led by Marine Le Pen is the best shield for the Jews of France,” said Bardella. If the far-right is the Jews' best hope of defeating antisemitism, we must work harder to find solutions to this problem.The government of Israel is more than right to hold a conference on antisemitism. The Diaspora Ministry is right to try its best to tackle an issue that has raised its head in ways unseen and unimaginable since the Holocaust.However, the government needs not to bring any more controversy to itself.The conference should have been all-encompassing. Since October 7, Jews across the entire religious and political spectrum have been targeted because they are Jews. The criminals who have emerged since the Hamas attacks have never cared about what type of Jew they are attacking.And Chikli's conference should have done the same. It should have been all-inclusive to bring in Left and Right, religious and non-religious, and Jewish and non-Jewish to speak about what can be done.The overshadowing of the conference was unfortunate for both Israel and its government. However, it was a step in the right direction. Maybe next time, the government can ensure an inclusive, all-embracing get-together that can include everyone affected by antisemitism.

Critics of the International Conference on Combating Antisemitism are too focused on politics, advised the World Jewish Congress Israel Region president in his speech, encouraging those who withdrew from the conference to engage in dialogue so that the right- and left-wing of politics could stand together against antisemitism.

However, it was a step in the right direction. Maybe next time, the government can ensure an inclusive, all-embracing get-together that can include everyone affected by antisemitism.

Canadian Jewish groups and politicians have expressed outrage over the recently revealed threats made by a Toronto man who was convicted for threatening to plant bombs in every local synagogue and kill as many Jews as he could.A Global News report last week highlighted the ruling, which hadn't received much coverage.  Afghanistan-born shwarma restaurant owner Waisuddin Akbari confided in car salesman Cameron Ahmad about the plot last March, according to the November Ontario Court of Justice ruling. Ahmad notified the police about the threats under the belief that Akbari was serious about the intention to commit a violent attack.The 41-year-old Akbari had come to 26-year-old Ahmad's dealership for an oil change and inquired about the possibility of upgrading to a new vehicle. Akbari allegedly expressed concerns about financing a new vehicle because he believed interest payments would be funneled to the Israeli government to finance a supposed genocide against Palestinians.

Demonstrators protest in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, in London, in January. (credit: HOLLIE ADAMS/REUTERS)Akbari said he had only raised the concern as a means to end the advances of the salesman, which Justice Edward Prutschi found to be “utterly bizarre” to say, considering that Akbari had admitted to seeking to discuss a new car and there were better methods to end the conversation than veering into a conspiracy theory. The two discussed the ongoing Israel-Hamas War, regarding which Ahmad told the court he was “on the side of the Palestinian state and the innocent civilians.” He had intoned as much to Akbari, but Ahmad reportedly became uncomfortable as Akbari allegedly went on to say that in response to a supposed genocide against Palestinian people, the Israeli state and Jewish people should also be subjected to genocide.Akbari allegedly shared his belief that the Israeli government controlled the world and was trying to exterminate non-Jews to enslave the world and poison it. He further equated Israelis and Jews to roaches and insects who should be exterminated. Akbari claimed to the court that he could not pronounce the words “roaches” and “insects.”Ahmad was reportedly shocked and scared about how calm, clear, and concise Akbari was when making his comments.

He consulted with a colleague who was a former police officer and his older brother, who was serving in the Canadian military.A day after the exchange, Akbari was arrested and charged for uttering threats.Akbari said to the court that he didn't know what Judaism was, and while he knew Jews existed, he didn't have knowledge about the religion and its connection to Israel. He also claimed to be unfamiliar with the word “synagogue.”  Prutschi found Akbari's testimony disjointed and vague and found the man to be inconsistent, evasive, and confusing. The judge also found it unlikely that Ahmad, who was sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, would manufacture detailed allegations about a mass murder threat against a customer who had been a complete stranger.York Centre MP Ya'ara Saks said she was deeply disturbed by the antisemitic threats.“It is unacceptable that Jewish communities continue to live in fear because of such hateful rhetoric and actions,” Saks said in a Wednesday statement. “In recent months, we have seen an alarming rise in antisemitic incidents, from shooting and vandalized synagogues to online threats and violent plots. These are not isolated incidents; they reflect a troubling increase in hate that we must confront together.”MP Kevin Vuong said on X/Twitter that it was important to stand with Jewish neighbors for the sake of all Canadians.

Akbari allegedly shared his belief that the Israeli government controlled the world and was trying to exterminate non-Jews to enslave the world and poison it. He further equated Israelis and Jews to roaches and insects who should be exterminated.

US President Donald Trump recently announced his groundbreaking plan to rebuild Gaza and resettle its population in neighboring Egypt and Jordan. Egypt and the Arab world quickly condemned the Trump plan and proposed their own strategies for the “day after.”Their urgency stemmed from the fear that the plan might materialize, as reports emerged that over 35,000 Gazan residents have already left the enclave. By putting forth his plan, President  Trump joined previous voices advocating for the removal of a segment of the Arab population.It is crucial to take a moment to reflect on history to understand the background of such plans. Just who are the Arabs Trump seeks to relocate?  In the aftermath of the 1948 War of Independence, approximately 750,000 Arabs found themselves outside the borders of the newly established Jewish state. Many actively fought against the Jews and were driven out during the conflict, while others, equally hostile, chose to leave voluntarily.Evidence indicates that their exodus was exacerbated by Arab leaders who urged them to evacuate during the fighting and return after the massacre of the Jews. Those Arabs who were not hostile and were willing to coexist with their Jewish neighbors decided to stay. They are now, and have been, citizens of Israel. Palestinians make their way as they flee their homes, after the Israeli army issued evacuation orders, in Jabalia, in the northern Gaza Strip March 25, 2025. (credit: REUTERS/Mahmoud Issa)Arabs fleeing the conflict crossed into eastern Palestine across the ceasefire line, areas now under Jordanian control. Others found refuge in Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza. After the war, Egypt annexed Gaza, while Jordan unlawfully seized the West Bank (Yehuda and Shomron).The Arab nations did not embrace their Palestinian brothers; instead, they were confined to dilapidated refugee camps managed by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, better known as UNRWA. Over time, the displaced Arabs held onto the assurances of Arab governments that their circumstances were temporary and that they would eventually return to their abandoned homes in Israel. However, returning to Israel was never a viable option, and integration into the host Arab nations was prohibited. Their resentment continued to grow.From 1949 to 1967, Arab governments determined the fates of these displaced individuals. There was never any discussion about creating a Palestinian state in the newly named Jordanian-held “West Bank” or Egypt's Gaza. Have they ever explained this omission while advocating for “Palestinian rights for self-determination”?In 1967, the Arab states launched yet another war to eliminate Israel. Instead, the Jewish state emerged victorious. In the aftermath of the defensive Six Day War, Israel not only expanded its territory but also inherited millions of Arab adversaries, a population that fought against Israel and sought to destroy the emerging Jewish state.

Trump, the perennial dealmaker striving to resolve a longstanding crisis, aims to rectify a significant wrong inflicted upon these people.Make no mistake.

They are the proverbial individuals who will “cut off their nose to spite their face.” They sacrifice their children for their animosity, choose funerals over weddings, and plan the murder of Jews instead of striving to build a vibrant and prosperous society. These individuals will never make good neighbors.These are the Arabs whom President Trump (and others before him) wish to relocate from Gaza and settle in their rightful places – neighboring Arab countries.The cynical refusal of Jordan, Egypt, and other Arab nations to integrate their kinsmen has perpetuated numerous wars and led to immense death and bloodshed among both Arabs and Jews. Trump, the perennial dealmaker striving to resolve a longstanding crisis, aims to rectify a significant wrong inflicted upon these people.Make no mistake. Even though treaties exist, neither Egypt nor Jordan is a friend of Israel. For eight decades, they have fed the Palestinians a diet of hatred in the hope that they will die, instead of Egyptians or Jordanians, in their never-ending campaign to wipe out the Jews.Islam's goal is for global supremacy in both political rule and religion. The first step is erasing Israel from the map. However, after suffering many defeats, they prefer using the Palestinian Arabs as cannon fodder.Israeli leaders have long recognized the threat posed by these Arabs. Some have called for their transfer to Egypt and Jordan, a tactic employed in other conflicts worldwide. Often, such calls were met with accusations of “racism” as their voices were silenced.Trump acknowledges this reality as well. By relocating a hostile and impoverished population to neighboring Arab states, he removes a constant threat from Israel's border. Is he a racist, too?Historically, after numerous upheavals and population transfers throughout Europe, refugees repeatedly moved on to lead productive lives. They did not wallow in hate and anger. Why are the Palestinians different? Instead of contributing positively to the world as poets, doctors, and scientists, they have given us terrorists, hijackers, and murderers.As more Israelis recognize the relentless goal of Arab Islamists for world domination, many have shifted their perspectives to the Right. They have abandoned the idea of a “two-state solution.” The reality is that they have been “mugged” too many times, and, as a result, they have ultimately become conservatives.Alex Sternberg is the author of Recipes from Auschwitz: The Survival Stories of Two Hungarian Jews with Historical Insight and the forthcoming The Toughest Jew in Brooklyn: A Memoir.David S.

The question wasn't a difficult one, but it was thought-provoking for the group of 70 16-year-olds visiting from America. These teenagers had just spent 10 days in Israel, some on their first trip to their homeland. I asked them to process what they had seen by answering one complex question.“What are you most proud of as a Zionist?”I expected most of the answers I received: the hi-tech success, the strength of the IDF, the unity over the hostages, the amazing kosher food, etc.  The pursuit of peaceNevertheless, one young woman surprised with her answer because it wasn't based on something she experienced but rather a conclusion she drew from talking to Israelis. She responded, “I'm proud of Israel's pursuit of peace, even during war. Everyone I talk to says they want the war to end and for there to be peace with our enemies.”I wasn't just impressed because her answer didn't involve food or a good time but because she had intuitively picked up on a feeling in Israel that the world does not understand about Israelis. Israelis abhor war and only fight when forced to defend their nation. They have always desired, loved, and chased peace.This attraction to peace is firmly rooted in Jewish tradition. Two thousand years ago, the sage Hillel taught, “Be among the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace.” Aaron, Moses's brother and the high priest, would work hard to bring peace to the Jewish people. A tour with the families of the abductees in Kibbutz Beeri (credit: AVSHALOM SASSONI)From its very inception, the Jewish state has made efforts to make peace with its enemies. Some of these efforts, as in the cases of Egypt, Jordan, and the UAE, have borne fruit. I felt that this student and her friends deserved more than the usual rundown of Israel's efforts at peace and the Arab and Palestinian intransigence that Israel had been met with, so I told them the little-known story of events near my home on October 4, 2023.The students immediately corrected me as I began and told me I must have meant October 7, 2023, the day of the Palestinian massacre of thousands of Jews. I explained that I meant what I said and that they should listen to the story of an important and unknown event.Women Wage Peace is an Israeli organization that was founded in the aftermath of Operation Protective Edge in 2014. It claims to be non-partisan and does not support any one specific solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   Stay updated with the latest news!

She was an award-winning activist who was involved and sat on the boards of pro-peace organizations such as B'Tselem, the Arab-Jewish Center for Equality, Empowerment, and Cooperation, and the New Israel Fund.In 1990, Silver moved to Kibbutz Be'eri, near the Gaza border. Part of her motivation for moving to Be'eri was its proximity to the Palestinians in Gaza, who she wanted to help, join as a partner, and create examples of peace. Following Silver's retirement in 2014, Silver founded Women Wage Peace. Looking for a peaceful future in a country at warTHREE DAYS before the Simchat Torah massacre on October 7, 2023, Vivian Silver watched a well-attended peace rally that she organized in Jerusalem and the Dead Sea bring together 1,500 Israeli and Arab participants.Reem Hajajreh, an Arab participant at the rally, said, “More and more women join the movement, women who want to protect their children and prevent them from being the next victim... We started out as a movement with a few lone women, and now we are thousands from the West Bank and Gaza.”Just three days after the peace rally, on October 7, 2023, the dreams of peace between Israelis and Arabs at the peace rally disintegrated. Palestinians, led by Hamas terrorists, crossed the Israel-Gaza border and massacred 1,200 Israelis, raped and maimed thousands of people, and kidnapped over 200 Jews into Gaza.As Palestinians crossed into Israel, they raided Kibbutz Be'eri and murdered Vivian Silver. It took over five weeks to locate her remains. It was widely reported that Hamas used an attendee list from the peace rally that Silver put together to identify and locate Israelis to kill on October 7.The students sat spellbound as I told them this story. Not one teacher, tour guide, or student had heard about the peace rally or how it was cynically perverted by Palestinian terrorists to be used as a basis for terrorism.I felt that the lesson of this tragic episode had to be spelled out explicitly for the students. Israelis extended themselves for peace to the extent their peace efforts endangered their own safety.The students raised their hands, and the need to express themselves was obvious on their faces. They brought up two ideas they felt were important to point out. While those interested in peace were rallying together to make the world a better place, Palestinian terrorists were using the peace activists' efforts to kill them and bring more violence to an already violent area.Second, the naïveté of the activists surprised the students. While they had the advantage of 20/20 hindsight, they couldn't believe that anyone thought peace was possible when the enemy was capable of such vicious hate, savagery, and brutality.Israel and her people have yet to enjoy a day of complete peace. Planning has already begun for Israel's 77th Independence Day celebrations, but it's a tragedy that Israel has yet to celebrate an Independence Day in complete peace from its enemies.There are those who will accuse Vivian Silver and her friends of being naïve and worse. Their characterization won't change a Jewish American 16-year-old student's pride in Israel and the Jewish people's long tradition of loving peace and chasing peace.The writer is a Zionist educator at institutions around the world. He recently published his book Zionism Today.

In 1990, Silver moved to Kibbutz Be'eri, near the Gaza border. Part of her motivation for moving to Be'eri was its proximity to the Palestinians in Gaza, who she wanted to help, join as a partner, and create examples of peace. Following Silver's retirement in 2014, Silver founded Women Wage Peace. Looking for a peaceful future in a country at warTHREE DAYS before the Simchat Torah massacre on October 7, 2023, Vivian Silver watched a well-attended peace rally that she organized in Jerusalem and the Dead Sea bring together 1,500 Israeli and Arab participants.Reem Hajajreh, an Arab participant at the rally, said, “More and more women join the movement, women who want to protect their children and prevent them from being the next victim... We started out as a movement with a few lone women, and now we are thousands from the West Bank and Gaza.”Just three days after the peace rally, on October 7, 2023, the dreams of peace between Israelis and Arabs at the peace rally disintegrated.

Implicit antisemitism is present in the content of over a third of the users of subreddits popular with QAnon members, a new study carried out by seven US universities revealed this week.Overall, more than one-third - 34.79% - of users in the two QAnon subreddits wrote antisemitic content using implicit terminology.  The new study placed special focus on implicit antisemitism, which it stated is harder to identify than explicit Jew-hatred.One of the researchers, Jeffrey Kopstein from the University of California, Irvine, said the findings, published online in PLOS One, have implications for tracking fast-moving changes in community-encoding language related to antisemitism as well as other group-based forms of hate.

Implicit antisemitic content and conspiracy narratives about Jews have been on the rise, especially on moderated platforms,” Kopstein said. Fig 3.

These terms were then split into explicit and implicit ones, resulting in a word bank of 892 explicit and 278 implicit terms. Within the bank of implicit antisemitism were terms historically used as indirect references to Jews, such as the names of influential Jews (Soros, Bloomberg, and Rothschild), terms like “banker,” “elite,” “globalist,” and also common antisemitic conspiracy phrases like “New World Order,” “Deep State,” and “Great Replacement.”The list also included Holocaust references such as names of concentration camps, references to Nazis, and Holocaust denial terms like “holohoax.”  The final section of implicit terms was those in reference to Israel or Israeli politics.Two specific QAnon subreddits were chosen - r/CBTS_Stream and r/greatawakening - both of which were de-platformed in 2018 due to threats of violence.The researchers mapped connections between antisemitic keywords and references on the subreddits using qualitative coding.The study revealed that while less than 7% of the two communities' 34,500 users wrote content with explicit antisemitic content, nearly all of them included implicit antisemitic language.Overall, more than one-third, 34.79%, of users in the two subreddits expressed antisemitic content using implicit terminology.The most common implicit term was ""deepstate,"" followed by ""pedophile,"" ""cabal,"" ""satanism,"" and ""globalist."" The researchers also explored the co-occurrence of explicit and implicit antisemitic references, finding that despite their relative infrequency across submissions and comments, posts with explicit antisemitic terms show strong patterns of co-occurrence with implicit antisemitic terms.

In terms of methodology, Kopstein and co-author David Frey, the founding director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at the United States Military Academy at West Point, created a list of implicit expressions strongly associated with antisemitic tropes and conspiracy narratives.

US President Donald Trump disclosed in his recent interview with NBC News that he was “very angry” and “pissed off” at Russian President Vladimir Putin for questioning the legitimacy of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration.

In an early-morning phone call interview on Sunday, Trump acknowledged that Putin is aware of his anger, but also noted that they have “a very good relationship” and that “the anger dissipates quickly... if he does the right thing.”

Putin on Friday called for the installation of a transitional administration in Ukraine, which may essentially force Zelenskyy out, reported AFP.

The US President also revealed that he is planning to speak with Putin this week. He, however, warned that he may put secondary tariffs on Russian oil.

“If Russia and I are unable to come to an agreement on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault — which it might not be — but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia.”

Trump went on to say that it would become difficult to do business in the US is prohibited for those who purchase oil from Russia. He stated that the oil will be subjected to a 25% tariff, which is equivalent to a 25–50 point tariff.

Trump's surprising remarks came after he recently called Zelensky a tyrant, adding that he was “sick” of the way he handled the ongoing war.

Earlier this month, the White House confirmed about a lengthy phone call between Trump and Putin, which resulted in “movement to peace” about Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

During his election campaign, Trump vowed to resolve the war in Ukraine, calling it his first foreign policy priority. Last week, Russia and Ukraine last week agreed for a partial truce that would provide safe passage in the Black Sea and prevent attacks on one another's energy infrastructure.

US President Donald Trump said on Sunday there would be bombings on Iran if Tehran didn't reach an agreement with his country over its nuclear program. He said he might also impose secondary tariffs on Iran if it didn't make a deal with the United States.

""If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing. But there's a chance that if they don't make a deal, I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago,"" he told NBC News.

Donald Trump withdrew the US from the nuclear deal with Iran in his first term as president. The deal had placed strict limits on Tehran's disputed nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. After the deal ended, Iran surpassed the agreed limits in its uranium enrichment program.

Donald Trump's remark came on a day when Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said that the Islamic Republic rejected direct negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program.

“We don't avoid talks; it's the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far,” Pezeshkian said in televised remarks during a Cabinet meeting. “They must prove that they can build trust.”

Pezeshkian had left open talks up until Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei came down hard on Trump in February and warned talks “are not intelligent, wise or honorable"" with his administration.

Iranian parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said on Friday that American bases in the Middle East are vulnerable to Iran's attacks.

""The Americans themselves know how vulnerable they are. If they violate Iran's sovereignty, it will be like a spark in a gunpowder depot, setting the entire region ablaze. In such a scenario, their bases and their allies will not be safe,"" he said.

Iran's remarks came in response to Trump's letter that arrived on March 12.

Meanwhile, Trump said in the interview that he was very angry with Vladimir Putin for questioning Ukraine's leadership.

Donald Trump issued a strong statement amidst his quest to annex Greenland and uproar over Vice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance's visit to the island nation.

Trump sat for an interview with NBC News, just a day after JD Vance and other American officials' trip to a US military installation in Greenland, garnering criticism from Denmark.

During the interview on Saturday, Trump insisted that he had a duty to seek possession of the Danish territory that has rejected his approaches and declined to rule out using military force in his attempt to seize Greenland.

While the Trump administration has been facing backlash over the US plans to take control of the island, Vance asserted he is “absolutely” serious about annexing Greenland.

“We'll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,” he told NBC News.

On being asked about his stance on Vance's recent statement that Trump does not want to use military force to takeover Greenland, Trump said that there's a “good possibility that we could do it without military force.” He, however, warned that it doesn't “take anything off the table.”

“We have an obligation to protect the world. This is world peace, this is international security. And I have that obligation while I'm president. No, I don't take anything off the table,” he stated.

Social media users react to Trump's statementMeanwhile, several X users reacted to Trump's remarks with one saying: “Annex Greenland? Let's do it diplomatically.” “Greenlanders overwhelmingly do not want that!” another stated. “Denmark, which is part of NATO, will not allow this. This will escalate to a war. I thought Trump was “so good at not doing war”??” one more commented. The fourth user stated that Trump “the President of peace” intends to “invade a sovereign country over absolutely nothing.” “There is no logic whatsoever to this madness.” Also Read: JD Vance, Denmark trade barbs over Greenland as US VP tears into ‘bullying tactics' of Washington's ‘close ally' Vance accuses China and Russia to invade GreenlandDuring his Greenland visit on Friday, Vance blasted Denmark, saying the nation was falling behind in security and allowing China and Russia to invade Greenland.

Vance later clarified to reporters that he was not indicating a shift in the administration's stance, but rather highlighting Trump's belief that the US can occupy Greenland without using military force. Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen chastised the Trump administration on Saturday for its “tone” in denouncing Denmark and Greenland, stating that his nation is already increasing its Arctic security investments and is still amenable to further collaboration with the US.

OpenAI's ChatGPT was down for several users across the world, amid users using the chatbot to create Studio Ghibli-styled animated avatars.

DownDetector, a website that tracks outages, witnessed 229 complaints by users about OpenAI. About 59 per cent of users lodged complaints related to ChatGPT.

OpenAI released its most advanced image generator through an update on Chat GPT-4o, allowing users to generate images in Hayao Miyazaki's hand-drawn animation style that featured in Oscar winning films such as ""Spirited Away"" and ""The Boy and the Heron"".

While OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman acknowledged the craze for Ghibli style images, he revealed that the “GPUs are melting”.

“It's super fun seeing people love images in chatgpt. but our GPUs are melting. we are going to temporarily introduce some rate limits while we work on making it more efficient. hopefully won't be long! chatgpt free tier will get 3 generations per day soon,” Altman said on X on March 27.

“Is it me or @OpenAI ChatGPT is kinda down? I feel alone, it's interesting how it has taken such a huge place in my life,” an X user posted.

ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is fighting copyright lawsuits over its flagship chatbot, has largely encouraged the “Ghiblification” experiments.

Sam Altman changed his profile on social media platform X into a Ghibli-style portrait. In a technical paper posted Tuesday, the company had said the new tool would be taking a “conservative approach” in the way it mimics the aesthetics of individual artists, AP reported.

After the viral trend, a video from 2016 resurfaced in which Studio Ghibli's legendary director Hayao Miyazaki is seen lashing out during an AI demonstration from staff.

""I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all. I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself,"" an English translation of his remarks said in the video.

A powerful 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Tonga, triggering an initial tsunami warning, which was later withdrawn for the Pacific island nation, Associated Press reported.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) reported that the quake occurred about 100 kilometres (62 miles) northeast of Tonga's main island in the early hours of Monday (local time). The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued an alert, warning that hazardous waves could affect coastlines within 300 kilometres (185 miles) of the epicentre.

“Hazardous tsunami waves from this earthquake are possible within 300 kilometres (186 miles) of the epicentre along the coasts of Tonga,” the US tsunami warning system said.

There were no immediate reports of damage.

German Research Centre for Geosciences (GeoForschungsZentrum in German) said that the earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 km.

Tonga is a Polynesian nation consisting of 171 islands and has a population of just over 100,000 people, with the majority residing on the main island, Tongatapu. It is located more than 3,500 kilometres (2,000 miles) east of Australia's coast.

Most islands boast white sandy beaches, coral reefs, and dense tropical rainforests.

The main island, Tongatapu, is surrounded by lagoons and limestone cliffs. It hosts Nuku'alofa, the kingdom's rural capital, along with beach resorts, plantations, and the Ha'amonga ʻa Maui, a historic coral stone gateway dating back to the 1200s.

Hundreds of international students in the United States have been shocked to receive emails from the US Department of State (DOS) instructing them to self-deport, following the revocation of their F-1 student visas. The crackdown, reportedly targeting students for their involvement in campus activism, has extended beyond those who physically participated in protests. Even students who shared, liked, or commented on ""anti-national"" social media posts have come under scrutiny, prompting concerns over the limits of free expression for foreign students in the US.

Among those affected, some Indian students have reportedly been caught in the sweep, with immigration attorneys confirming that even sharing a political post could result in visa revocation, according to The Times of India.

The latest figures from the Open Doors report show that of the 1.1 million international students studying in the US for the 2023-24 academic year, 331,000 are from India.

​The F-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa that permits international students to reside in the United States for the purpose of pursuing academic studies at accredited institutions.

Eligible institutions include universities, colleges, high schools, seminaries, conservatories, and approved language training programs. Applicants must be accepted into a full-time program at a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP)-certified school, demonstrate English proficiency or enroll in courses to achieve it, and provide proof of sufficient financial resources to support their education and living expenses in the US.

According to data from the US Department of State, Indian students have historically constituted a significant portion of the international student population in the United States.

The crackdown follows remarks by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who announced that several international student visas had been revoked for “anti-national” activities. Rubio emphasized that the US had the right to determine who is allowed entry, saying, “Every country in the world has a right to decide who comes in as a visitor and who doesn't.”

Rubio also referenced the recent launch of an AI-powered app, ""Catch and Revoke,"" which aims to detect students supporting terrorist organizations such as Hamas. As part of the growing scrutiny, even new student visa applications are now under review, with the DOS looking closely at the social media activity of applicants. Those deemed guilty could face visa denials, preventing them from studying in the US.

 

Startling email for studentsThe email sent to students by the Trump administration notified the students them that their F-1 visa had been revoked under Section 221(i) of the US Immigration and Nationality Act. It went on to warn the student that remaining in the US without legal immigration status could result in fines, detention, or deportation. The email also indicated that students could be sent back to countries other than their home nations. “If you intend to travel to the United States in the future, you must apply for another US visa, and a determination on your eligibility will be made at that time,” the email stated. The message further instructed students to use the CBP Home App, introduced during the Trump administration, to facilitate their departure from the US. It also warned students not to attempt to use their revoked visas, emphasizing that they must present their passports at the US embassy or consulate upon departure. Concern among students, immigrantsSecretary of State Rubio has previously stated that visas are not a ""birthright"" and warned that those found violating the terms of their visitation will be forced to leave. “If you violate the terms of your visitation, you are going to leave,” Rubio said during an appearance on CBS News's 'Face The Nation'. The issue has raised significant questions about the intersection of free speech and US immigration laws. Some students, like one anonymous individual who posted about their experience on Reddit, have expressed shock, claiming their visa status was revoked despite having no criminal record and maintaining a high academic standing. The student admitted to posting political memes online but questioned whether that should impact their F-1 status. ""Don't we have freedom of speech in the US?"" they wrote.

The crackdown has sparked a broader debate about the implications of social media activity on students' legal status in the US. Immigration experts, including Soundarya Balasubramani, have urged international students to review their documentation carefully and avoid unnecessary travel. Balasubramani also recommended that students maintain detailed records of their academic enrollment and other visa-related information to protect their status.



At universities like Columbia, where protests have been organized to protect the rights of international students and advocate for academic freedom, the impact of this visa revocation policy has been particularly felt. Union members, including the Student Workers of Columbia, have called for a restoration of academic freedom and protections for international students against what they see as an overreach by the US government.

A £275,000 Aurus Senat limousine, believed to be from Russian President Vladimir Putin's official car fleet, reportedly exploded and caught fire on a street in Moscow near the country's top intelligence agency FSB's headquarters.

The incident is said to have taken place on March 29 on a street north of Moscow's FSB headquarters, located near the Lubyanka, according to EuroWeekly.

A purported video of the alleged explosion has gone viral on social media, leading to speculation of an assassination attempt on the Russian leader amid talks backed by the United States to end Moscow's war in Ukraine.

In the viral video, workers from nearby establishments could be seen helping to extinguish the fire, which is believed to have started from the car's engine bay area and spread to its interiors.

Thick smoke was seen flowing out of the vehicle, whose front portion is also believed to have been damaged in the incident.

It was not immediately clear who was present in the car during the incident, as no injuries were reported, according to The Sun.

It is suspected that the fire started in the car's engine and quickly engulfed the entire vehicle, EuroWeekly reported. 

Ukrainian government and military analysts speaking to AP expected Russia to launch a fresh offensive across the 1,000-kilometer front line to strengthen its negotiating position ahead of potential talks with Kyiv.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia is getting ready for new offensives in the northeastern regions.

“They're dragging out the talks and trying to get the U.S. stuck in endless and pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions' just to buy time and then try to grab more land,” Zelenskyy said Thursday in a visit to Paris.

The two sides have stepped up their aerial attacks even as US President Donald Trump pushes them to agree to a ceasefire after more than three years of intense fighting.

Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaching commitments to not strike energy facilities.

Zelensky also rejected Putin's idea of a “transitional administration”, backed by the United Nations, in Ukraine and said it was Putin's latest ploy to delay a peace deal.

Before saying ""I do,"" couples go through various compatibility tests - some serious, some lighthearted. These tests can range from relationship quizzes, taking a trip together, or even living together temporarily to see how well they gel together. However, entrepreneur and author Sahil Bloom claims to have the ultimate test that couples should take together before they take the plunge. He calls it the Ikea marriage test.

The premise of the test is simple. According to Sahil Bloom, the New York Times bestselling author of ‘The 5 Types of Wealth,' before getting married, couples should go to Ikea, buy a piece of furniture, and assemble it together.

If they can successfully assemble the piece of furniture without getting on each other's nerves, they are ready to get married.

According to Bloom, who graduated from Stanford with a double major in Economics and Sociology, any two people who can navigate the labyrinthine stores of the Swedish furniture retailer, pick out a piece they both like, and assemble it together without wanting to kill each other, are also well prepared to navigate the complexities of marriage.

He recommended the test on his X profile yesterday.

 

This is not the first time that Sahil Bloom, a former finance professional, has spoken about the Ikea marriage test. “Before you marry someone, go to IKEA together and buy a piece of furniture. Bring it home and build it.

“If you can successfully navigate that entire process without wanting to kill each other, you're ready to get married,” he wrote in an Instagram post in February 2023.

 

A post shared by Sahil Bloom (@sahilbloom)

And for couples who don't need furniture? Bloom recommends going out in the water on a tandem kayak, which is a kayak designed for two people.

“If you don't need furniture, get a tandem kayak and go out for a half day adventure. That will tell you everything you need to know,” he says.

His recommendations have garnered a ton of reactions, some serious and some amused.

“My wife properly navigated this by buying what she wants, then closes me in a room to cuss and scream over the assembly process by myself,” joked one X user, highlighting the difficulty in putting together Ikea furniture.

“Seems like I did this without knowing it's a thing. She's now my fiancé,” another wrote.

The Trump administration has reportedly paused the processing of Green Cards filed by some people, including approved refugees. This is part of the US President's larger policy to clamp down on immigrants.

A report by CBS News said that the requests for legal permanent residency that were filed by immigrants who were granted asylum or refugee status have been suspended. This step can affect Indians in four major ways.

Indian nationals face some of the longest green card backlogs because of per-country caps. Several Indian immigrants on H-1B visas are awaiting their green cards and further delays could lead to their work permits expiring. One way the recent pause could affect Indians is that this can lead to potential job loss and deportation risks.

Laura Collins, director at the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative, told NBC News, “All these people who are approved to remain in the United States have already passed government scrutiny.” She said that further delays are not necessary.

Second, some employment-based applicants might even have to wait decades for approval, the Cato Institute found. This pause could further extend the delays.

Third, Indian immigrants who were sponsoring family members now may have to face separation for a prolonged time.

Lastly, Indians will be affected by the Green Card freeze as the move will impact those applying for permanent residency. There were more than 2.9 million immigrants in the US as of 2023, and Indians are expected to be the primary community that could face legal uncertainties.

Notably, more than 51,000 Indian nationals applied for asylum in the US in 2023, which was a huge increase from previous years. It was the highest number of asylum requests during the recorded period. Per a research by Johns Hopkins University, the number of Indians seeking asylum in the United States increased from 9,000 in 2018 to 51,000 in 2023, which was a 466% rise in five years.

An American mother who relocated to India nearly four years ago has sparked a conversation online after sharing why she believes her children will have a more enriching childhood in India compared to the United States.

Kristen Fischer, a mother of three, took to Instagram to post a video of her child walking in Indian street, accompanied by a thoughtful caption explaining her perspective. She wrote, ""My kids will benefit so much by growing up in India. Here are just a few of the ways they will be better off spending their childhood in India instead of the USA.""

(Also read: American mom living in India names 10 things she wishes US had: ‘First time I ever…')

Fischer emphasised that living in India provides her children with a unique opportunity to develop cultural awareness and adaptability. ""Living in India will expose my children to a rich diversity of cultures, languages, and customs. This helps them develop a deep understanding and appreciation for different cultures, encouraging open-mindedness and adaptability.""

She also highlighted the advantage of multilingualism, stating, ""India is home to numerous languages and dialects. My kids will learn Hindi and be exposed to many other languages, alongside English. Being multilingual boosts cognitive development, improves communication skills, and enhances future job prospects.""

Growing up in India, according to Fischer, will provide her children with a more global outlook. ""They learn about global issues, regional challenges, and differing societal norms, which helps them develop a more nuanced perspective on global citizenship.""

She also stressed that adapting to a new environment fosters resilience and independence. ""Living in a different country requires children to navigate challenges, from adjusting to a new school system to understanding local customs. This builds resilience, problem-solving skills, and independence.""

Fischer believes her children will develop higher emotional intelligence due to India's diverse social norms and family structures. ""They learn to interact with a variety of people and understand different emotional cues, improving empathy and social skills.""

She further added that India's strong family bonds play a vital role in childhood development. ""In many Indian families, there is an emphasis on close-knit relationships and extended family networks. This provides my kids with a sense of belonging, emotional support, and deeper familial connections that is very different from the more individualistic American model.""

The post also touched upon the values of gratitude and simplicity. ""Living in a country where some regions experience stark contrasts between wealth and poverty can teach children the value of gratitude, simplicity, and the importance of appreciating what they have.""

Fischer concluded by noting that her children will also benefit from global networks. ""My kids will form friendships with people from all over the world. These connections can serve as a global network for their benefit in their career later in life.""

In a moment of deep religious significance, Saroops, or physical copies, of the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism, were recently transported from Delhi to Hong Kong with the highest level of reverence. Considered the living embodiment of the Sikh Gurus' teachings, the sacred texts were flown on a Air India flight, with the entire business class booked exclusively to ensure their respectful handling.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian announced on Sunday that Tehran rejects direct negotiations with the United States regarding its rapidly advancing nuclear program. This marks Iran's first response to a letter from US President Donald Trump to the country's supreme leader.

Pezeshkian said that Iran's response, conveyed through Oman, left open the possibility of indirect talks with Washington. However, such negotiations have stalled since Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2018 nuclear deal during his first term.

In the aftermath, regional tensions escalated, leading to attacks on land and at sea. The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza further heightened instability, with Israel targeting leaders of Iran's so-called ""Axis of Resistance"".

Meanwhile, as the US launches airstrikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, the possibility of military action against Iran's nuclear program remains a looming threat.

Trump's letter reached Tehran on March 12, though he provided few details about its contents in a television interview.

“I've written them a letter saying, I hope you're going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing,” Trump said in the interview.

The move echoes Trump's previous letter exchanges with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his first term, which led to face-to-face meetings but failed to produce agreements on limiting Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.

The last time Trump attempted to send a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei through the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2019, Khamenei mocked the effort.

Pezeshkian's announcement highlights the shifting dynamics in Iran since his election six months ago, despite his initial campaign pledge to re-engage with the West. Meanwhile, Trump's re-election and the revival of his “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran have led to a sharp decline in Iran's currency.

Pezeshkian had left the door open for negotiations until Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 85, took a firm stance against Trump in February, declaring talks with his administration as neither “intelligent, wise, nor honourable.” Pezeshkian then hardened his rhetoric against the United States.

In recent weeks, Iran has sent mixed signals. During Quds (Jerusalem) Day demonstrations on Friday, organizers instructed crowds to chant only “Death to Israel!”—a departure from previous years when “Death to America!” was also a common slogan.

A video from Iran's Revolutionary Guard unveiling an underground missile base showed troops stepping on an Israeli flag painted on the ground, but no American flag, which is often seen in such propaganda visuals.

However, Press TV, the English-language branch of Iranian state media, recently published an article listing U.S. military bases in the Middle East as potential targets. The list included Camp Thunder Cove on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, where the U.S. has stationed stealth B-2 bombers, likely used in operations over Yemen.

On Friday, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf warned that the U.S. is highly vulnerable, stating: “If they violate Iran's sovereignty, it will be like a spark in a gunpowder depot, setting the entire region ablaze. Their bases and allies will not be safe.”

However, Tehran's two recent direct attacks on Israel using ballistic missiles and drones caused minimal damage, while Israel retaliated by destroying Iranian air defense systems.

Iran's rejection of direct talks marks the latest escalation in tensions over its nuclear program.

Trump's letter comes as both the US and Israel have warned that they will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, raising concerns of a military confrontation. Meanwhile, Tehran continues enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels of 60% purity, a threshold typically reached only by nuclear-armed nations.

While Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, its officials have increasingly hinted at pursuing a bomb. A February report from the UN's nuclear watchdog confirmed that Iran had accelerated its production of near-weapons-grade uranium.

Iran's reluctance to engage with Trump is also likely tied to his ordering the drone strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in January 2020.

The US has claimed that Iran plotted to assassinate Trump before the November election, though Tehran denied this, despite officials making direct threats against him.

Amid reports that of Donald Trump being suggested to oust National Security Adviser Mike Waltz's after his embarrassing misstep of inclusion of a journalist in a Signal chat, the US President on Saturday made his clearest commitment to not fire anyone over the accidental leak of his administration's plans for an airstrike against the Houthis in Yemen.

US President Donald Trump said he doesn't fire people because of “fake news and witch hunts”, despite the White House acknowledging the leak.

""I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,” Trump said in an interview with NBC News.

Donald Trump also asserted that he had confidence in his national security adviser Mike Waltz and Pete Hegseth, his Pentagon chief.

Asked if there were conversations about firing Mike Waltz, Donald Trump said, “I've never heard that. And nobody else makes that decision but me, and I've never heard it."" 

Mike Waltz mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic magazine, to a group text using the Signal encrypted messaging service where top officials were discussing plans to attack the Houthis.

During the chat, Hegseth included details on how the strike would unfold before it took place.

Afterwards, The Atlantic published an article on the internal exchange, shocking the national security establishment and hitting headlines across the world.

Following a tumultuous day of headlines surrounding the now-infamous Signal chat, Vice President JD Vance, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, and senior personnel official Sergio Gor held a private meeting with President Donald Trump on Wednesday evening to discuss National Security Adviser Mike Waltz's misstep, according to a Politico report.

Vance, Wiles, and Gor gently suggested it might be time to part ways with Waltz, according to two sources familiar with the discussion cited in the report, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

While Donald Trump acknowledged the mistake, the president ultimately chose not to act on the advice to fire Mike Waltz—at least for now. The sources indicated that Trump's reluctance stemmed from one key factor: he was unwilling to give the liberal media or Democrats a ""win"" by dismissing the national security adviser.

“They don't want to give the press a scalp,” the report quoted a White House ally close to the team.

White House insiders suggest that while Waltz is still employed, some administration officials are simply waiting for the right moment to let him go, perhaps once the news cycle quiets down.

One insider said: “They'll stick by him for now, but he'll be gone in a couple of weeks.”

Vance's office declined to comment over the controversy. Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated Trump's support for Waltz, stating in a statement, “President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.”

The White House is has drawn flak after posting a Ghibli-inspired illustration of an illegal migrant and convicted fentanyl dealer, Virginia Basora-Gonzalez, in tears during her arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.

The image, shared on the White House's official X (formerly Twitter) account, depicted Basora-Gonzalez's March 12 arrest.

In recent days, social media has been flooded with AI-generated images transformed into the iconic animation style of Studio Ghibli, started by OpenAI's ChatGPT.

 

Brands, influencers, and political figures have jumped in to the trend, but the White House's decision to use it for a sensitive topic has sparked backlash.

“Just my two cents: official government accounts should NEVER try to be cool or trendy. This is even more cringy than when the FDA did this,” a user commented under the post shared by the White House.

“We're living in levels of dystopia so deep that Black Mirror couldn't even prophesise, parody or emulate it,” another user wrote, while another added, “This is horrible leadership. I'm on board with strict borders. But mocking them? This is embarrassing and shameful.”

A third commenter remarked, “I don't care if you're a Republican or a Democrat or if you oppose immigration or support it, this is not the behaviour of responsible adults who are charged with the nation's wellbeing.”

The backlash even referenced Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki, noting that he would likely have disapproved of the use of his iconic art style in such a context. Miyazaki, known for his political stance, notably skipped the 2003 Oscars when Spirited Away won, citing his refusal to visit a country engaged in the Iraq War.

Beyond the public outrage, the viral trend has also sparked ethical concerns about the use of AI tools trained on copyrighted works. OpenAI, which has encouraged AI-generated art experiments, even saw its CEO Sam Altman join in by changing his own X profile picture to a Ghibli-style portrait.

Basora-Gonzalez, the woman in the illustration, had been deported from the US after being convicted of fentanyl trafficking. She was arrested in Philadelphia by ICE agents for allegedly attempting to re-enter the country.

Some even defended the White House for the illustration. “I don't know about you, but if you haven't lost someone to fentanyl laced into something else, maybe sit this one out. this woman kills strangers without consequence, and the top replies are scolding white house for taking her off the streets? even accounts i used to respect. wild how many people here are this naive,” a user wrote.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has praised rapper Hanumankind for showcasing India's rich traditional culture globally through his latest song, Run It Up. Also read: Hanumankind returns with Run it Up after Big Dawgs, fans say ‘He is biggest advocate for Make in India'

Narendra Modi expressed his admiration for Hanumankind's efforts during the 120th episode of his monthly radio program, Mann Ki Baat, highlighting the song's role in promoting traditional Indian martial arts such as Kalaripayattu, Gatka, and Thang-Ta.

He praised Hanumankind, stating that his efforts have helped people worldwide learn about India's traditional martial arts.

Narendra Modi said, “Friends, our indigenous games are now becoming a part of popular culture. You all must be knowing the famous rapper Hanumankind. His new song 'Run It Up' is becoming quite famous these days. Our traditional martial arts like Kalaripayattu, Gatka and Thang-Ta have been included in it.""

He added, ""I congratulate Hanumankind that due to his efforts people of the world are getting to know about our traditional martial arts.""

In March, Hanumankind, who shot to global fame this year with his viral hit, Big Dawgs in 2024, returned with his first solo, which is titled Run It Up. The song boasts a distinctive Indian flavour, drawing heavily from the country's rich cultural heritage, particularly the folk traditions and martial arts of the country.

 

In the song, the Kerala-born rapper delivered his trademark rapid-fire verses with effortless ease. The rhyme schemes are uncomplicated, and the beats are catchy. For the song, Hanumankind reunited with his Big Dawgs director Bijoy Shetty, and producer Kalmi. The visuals for Run it Up serve as a vibrant tribute to Indian culture. While his previous Big Dawgs video was set in a daring well of death, this latest release showcases an array of martial arts and traditional dance forms from across India, with a special emphasis on Kerala's rich cultural heritage.

An armed resistance movement against Myanmar's military-run government alleged on Sunday that the junta has been carrying out airstrikes on villages even as the country is in the grip of crises precipitated by a massive earthquake. The tremors killed 1700 people and injured over 3400.

The Karen National Union, one of Myanmar's oldest ethnic armies, claimed in a statement that the junta ""continues to carry out airstrikes targeting civilian areas, even as the population suffers tremendously from the earthquake"".

It said the military must prioritise relief efforts, but it is focused on ""deploying forces to attack its people"", Reuters reported.

The earthquake has shattered critical infrastructure in several cities in Myanmar, including airports, bridges and roads. The rubble and communication collapse have prevented aid workers from reaching those trapped under the debris. The stench emanating from corpses has permeated many towns, including Mandalay.

The United Nations has also flagged a crippling shortage of medical supplies.

Myanmar has been locked in civil war with multiple armed opposition groups since a 2021 coup when the military seized power from the elected government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

According to the Free Burma Rangers, a relief organisation, military jets bombarded Karen state, near the KNU headquarters, shortly after the earthquake.

The epicenter of the 7.7-magnitude quake was in an area held by junta forces. However, it also destroyed territories held by rebels.

Richard Horsey, the senior Myanmar adviser at Crisis Group, said some anti-junta forces have halted their offensives, but fighting continues elsewhere.

""The regime also continues to launch airstrikes, including in affected areas. That needs to stop,"" he said.

He added that the regime was not providing much visible support in quake-hit areas.

""Local fire brigades, ambulance crews, and community organisations have mobilised, but the military - who would normally be mobilised to support in such a crisis - are nowhere to be seen,"" Horsey said.

Disaster ravaged Myanmar was hit by another 5.1 magnitude earthquake on Sunday even rescue operations continued after a 7.7 magnitude tremor hit the country on Friday, which has killed over 1,600 people, left over 3,400 missing and more than a million displaced. There were no immediate reports of further damage after the latest aftershock.



Many of Mandalay's 1.5 million people spent the night sleeping on the streets, either left homeless by the earthquake. The United Nations said that damaged critical infrastructure, including an airport, highways and bridges have slowed down the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Satellite images from Myanmar have surfaced, showing the aftermath of the earthquake, including a collapsed bridge and fallen control tower at Nay Pyi Taw international airport.

 

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned that a “severe shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers.”

Residents said that the presence of authorities were scarce, and they were forced to fend for themselves. An official from the Catholic Relief Services in Myanmar said efforts are mainly led by local volunteers. “Hospitals are really struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, there's a shortage of medical supplies, and people are struggling to find food and clean water,” she told AP.



3.5 million displacedAbout 3.5 million people were already displaced before the disaster due to a civil war between the military and the opposition led by the erstwhile National Unity Government. The ethnic civil war was triggered by 2021 military coup that ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Neighbouring countries including India, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Russia have rushed humanitarian aid to the Southeast Asian country.

Neighbouring countries including India, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Russia have rushed humanitarian aid to the Southeast Asian country.

Under “Operation Brahma,” two Indian C-17 military transport aircraft landed late on Saturday at Naypitaw with equipment to build a field hospital unit. Myanmar's foreign ministry said the Indian personnel would travel north to Mandalay to establish a 60-bed emergency treatment centre.

China has sent more than 135 rescue personnel, experts, and supplies like medical kits and generators and pledged around $13.8 million in emergency aid. The country's state media said on Sunday that 12 people were injured due to the damage from tremors.

A mother was killed in Brooklyn along with her two daughters after a driver with a suspended license slammed into an Uber before careening into the family while they were walking home from synagogue. The woman's son, 4, was also hit and was fighting for his life in critical condition, authorities said, according to the New York Post. A total of nine people were injured in the incident.

The incident took place on Ocean Parkway close to Quentin Road in heavily Orthodox Jewish Gravesend. An Uber driver in a Toyota Camry and an Audi reportedly collided.

“The bang I heard, it was like an earthquake,” a witness told the outlet. “It went on for a good 30 seconds. It felt like the world stopped for that second.”

The Audi was being driven by Miriam Yarimi. It continued forward and then careened into a crosswalk, killing the 35-year-old woman and her daughters, 8 and 6, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a press conference at the scene. “This was a horrific tragedy caused by someone who shouldn't have been on the road,” Tisch added.

Yarimi, 32, and the 62-year-old Camry operator were taken to Coney Island hospital in stable condition. They were expected to get tested for drunken driving. Yarimi has not been charged in connection with the incident.

The three passengers in the Uber – two children and an adult — were rushed to Kings County Hospital in stable condition.

When the crash took place, the now-deceased woman's husband was home with their infant. “My neighbor had to go to the husband and tell him that his wife and two children passed away,” a resident said. “He lost two out of four children, yes, in one day. Plus his wife.”

According to the witness, the neighbourhood was filled with worshippers after Sabbath services on Saturday, March 29, “like Manhattan on Christmas,” before the tragedy struck. “It is a shock,” he said. “I think everyone that was witnessing this, I mean, at like 1 o'clock in the afternoon, everyone's coming home from synagogue. The streets are full with pedestrians.”

Mayor Eric Adams referred to the incident as a tragedy of “Shakespearean proportions.” “A mother going for a simple stroll on a sunny day was struck and killed,” he said at an unrelated event. “I cannot imagine the pain of the family.”

In a rare revelation, Pakistan on Saturday admitted to have killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in the country's northwest and promised to probe the circumstances.

Authorities in Pakistan made the admission Saturday evening about the deaths which occurred in the early hours of that morning in a remote hilltop area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province's Katlang, according to an Associated Press report, which added that it was not immediately clear how the operations were carried out.

Pakistan does not usually reveals civilian casualties that take place during anti-militant activities.

Provincial government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif said that reports indicated the location was being used as a “hideout and transit point for terrorist” elements.

Subsequent information revealed that some unarmed civilians were present in the vicinity of the site, Saif added.

According to locals 10 bodies, including those of women and children, were recovered from the area where government officials claimed the anti-militant operation took place.

The victims belonged to the Swat region and were nomads with livestock in the Shamozai mountains, the AP report quoted locals as saying.

Their families of the victims protested the deaths by keeping the bodies on the Swat Highway even as spokesperson Saif condemned the killing of the unarmed individuals, calling it an ""unintended consequence"".

The loss of unarmed individuals was deeply regrettable and the tragic incident occurred as a consequence of targeting terrorists, Saif said.

“The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,” the report quoted Saif.

A statement from the provincial government said the operation “successfully neutralised several high-value targets” linked to ongoing militant activities in the region. It also said, “the fog of war can sometimes lead to unintended consequences.”

The Hamas militant group said Saturday it has accepted a new Gaza ceasefire proposal from mediators Egypt and Qatar, but Israel said it has made a counter-proposal in “full coordination” with the third mediator, the United States.

Egypt early in the week made a proposal to get the troubled ceasefire back on track, following Israel's surprise resumption of fighting. It was not immediately clear whether the proposal changed before Khalil al-Hayyah, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, announced it had been accepted.

Early in the week, an Egyptian official described the proposal to The Associated Press, saying Hamas would release five living hostages, including an American-Israeli, from Gaza in return for Israel allowing aid into the territory and a weekslong pause in fighting. Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the closed-door talks.

ALSO READ: Israel says it struck ‘key terrorist' as Hamas official dies in Gaza hospital attack

On Saturday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave no details about Israel's counter-proposal, which it said was offered after Netanyahu held consultations on Friday.

Israel a week and a half ago ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people. The White House blamed Hamas for the renewed fighting.

Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds — 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel also wants Hamas to give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile. On Saturday, Israel widened its ground operations in Gaza's southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

Frustrated by the threat to remaining hostages in Gaza, families and others rallied again Saturday evening to call for a deal that would bring everyone home.

“The price of your war is the life of the hostages!” some protesters chanted in Tel Aviv. Minor scuffles broke out with police.

“War will not bring our hostages home, it will kill them,” Naama Weinberg, cousin of deceased hostage Itay Svirsky, told a weekly gathering of families in Tel Aviv.

The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 50,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have caused vast destruction and at their height displaced some 90% of Gaza's population of over 2 million people.

Early this month, Israel again cut off all supplies to Gaza to pressure Hamas to accept new terms to the ceasefire that started in mid-January.

Israel had balked at entering negotiations over the truce's second phase, which were meant to begin in early February. Under the agreement, phase two was meant to bring the release of the remaining 24 living hostages, an end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

Rescuers race against time to find any survivors in ravaged Myanmar after the March 28 powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake and multiple aftershocks, described as force equivalent to more than ""300 atomic bombs"".

A 5.1 magnitude earthquake hit near Myanmar's second-largest city on Sunday as well, the USGS said, the latest in a string of aftershocks following Friday's temblor. 

The earthquake, strongest Myanmar has recorded in a century, has killed over 1,600 people and left hundreds injured and missing. The earthquake also led to casualties in neighbouring Thailand, where 17 people have died in Bangkok, as per city authorities. A 30-storey under-construction skyscraper in Bangkok collapsed after the Friday earthquake.

The Myanmar earthquake, whose epicentre was near Mandalay, was followed by over a dozen aftershocks, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). USGS data showed that a total 15 earthquakes were recorded in Myanmar within 10 hours on Friday, starting with the massive 7,7 magnitude trembler that struck the country at 06:20:54 (UTC).

The most powerful aftershock was measured at Magnitude 6.7, occurring at 06:32:04 (UTC), according to USGS. On Saturday, March 29, also, Myanmar was hit by at least two earthquakes, with one measuring 5.1 in magnitude, other 4.2, as per USGS.

The earthquake in Myanmar unleashed energy equivalent to “334 atomic bombs,” according to a geologist cited in a CNN report. “The force that a quake like this releases is about 334 atomic bombs,” the report quoted geologist Jess Phoenix.

Another seismologist said that the earthquake was like a “great knife cut into the Earth.”

 

Myanmar is embroiled in a civil war between a military junta that seized power in 2021 and pro-democracy fighters as well as ethnic rebel groups fighting to overthrow it. Pro-democracy rebels declared a ceasefire in quake-hit areas to allow for emergency aid to reach victims of the disaster as the search for survivors continue.

The shadow National Unity Government said the People's Defence Force will pause offensive military operations for two weeks except for defensive actions, effective Sunday, according to a statement. It also appealed for relief agencies and international groups to step up aid.

While the death toll currently stands at over 1,600 people, the USGS said the highest probability is that more than 10,000 people may have died, according to a Bloomberg report.

USGS warned that estimated economic losses may exceed Myanmar's gross domestic product.

An initial assessment by Myanmar's opposition NUG cited in a Reuters report said at least 2,900 buildings, 30 roads and seven bridges had been damaged by the earthquake.

""Due to significant damage, Naypyitaw and Mandalay international airports are temporarily closed,"" the report quoted the NUG.

The control tower at the airport in Naypyitaw, Myanmar's purpose-built capital city, also collapsed in the earthquake, making it inoperable, a person with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.

The city of Venice on Saturday confirmed that it will host the lavish wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sanchez, while assuring residents that the arrival of hundreds of celebrities will not cause disruptions for citizens and tourists alike.

City officials have confirmed that the wedding celebrations will take place from June 24 to 26 and will take place on the multi-billionaire's $500-million superyacht Koru, which will be anchored in the Venice lagoon, a CNN report said.

Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said, ""We are mutually working and supporting the organisers to ensure that the event will be absolutely respectful of the fragility and uniqueness of the city.""

The city, however did not give a specific date for the Bezos and Sanchez' nuptials and said, “The many speculations and fake news circulating about Jeff Bezos' wedding are completely unfounded.”

It noted that only 200 guests would be invited to the wedding, making it easier for authorities to accommodate them without causing any disruption to the city, its residents or tourists. The city said it has a vast experience in handling ""much larger"" international events.

Citing the G20 and G7 summits, the Architecture and Cinema Biennales, as well as other private events and VIP weddings, the city said, ""Venice is used to being the stage for events and shows every week, without significant impacts.""

Earlier, several media reports had suggested that Bezos' wedding organisers had already reserved rooms at Venice's main luxury hotels and booked a large number of gondolas and water taxis, a daily mode of transportation for citizens and tourists, for a few days in late June.

Rubbishing all such reports, the city said that it ""is their utmost priority to make sure the city functions as normal, for all, with no disruption to anyone"".

However, a CNN report had mentioned that Venice's major luxe hotels along the Grand Canal, including Belmond Hotel Cipriani, the St Regis Venis, the Gritti Palace, the Hotel Danieli and the luxurious Grand Aman Hotel, the venue for George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin's 2014 wedding, were all almost entirely booked for the last weekend of June.

Bezos and Sanchez, a former journalist, first went public as a couple back in 2019 and later got engaged in May 2023. As per Page Six, the couple sent out their wedding invitations earlier this month.

As per a report from the People, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner will be in attendance at the couple's wedding, while the guest list included the names of Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian and Eva Longoria.

Previously, the 61-year-old Bezos was married to MacKenzie Scott for 25 years and has four children with her.

A 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck near Mandalay in Myanmar around midday on Friday, killing over 1,700 people, causing widespread destruction, toppling numerous buildings, and damaging critical infrastructure, including the city's airport.

The quake resulted from the rupture of a 200-kilometre (125-mile) section of the fault, leading to extensive damage across central Myanmar, particularly in the Sagaing, Mandalay, Magway, and Bago regions and Shan State. Due to major telecommunication disruptions, information remains scarce from areas beyond Mandalay and Naypyidaw.

The shockwaves travelled to Thailand; the tremors were felt across much of the country, causing the collapse of a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok, nearly 1,300 kilometres (800 miles) from the epicentre.

While Bangkok experienced strong shaking that prompted mass evacuations and a temporary suspension of public transport, overall damage to the city's buildings and infrastructure was minimal compared to the devastation in Myanmar.

The earthquake claimed 18 lives, including 11 workers who died when the Bangkok building collapsed. Dozens remain trapped under the rubble, and 33 others sustained injuries.

According to the BBC, Rebecca Bell, a tectonics expert at Imperial College London, explained that faults—cracks in the Earth's crust—form to accommodate tectonic movement, allowing plates to ""slither"" sideways.

Earthquakes can originate from depths of up to 700 km (435 miles) below the surface. However, this particular quake struck just 10 km beneath the surface, making it very shallow, which intensified the shaking felt above ground.

Measuring 7.7 on the moment magnitude scale, the earthquake was extremely powerful, releasing more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, as per the US Geological Survey.

Bell attributed the quake's magnitude to the nature of the fault.

""The straight nature [of the fault] means earthquakes can rupture over large areas - and the larger the area of the fault that slips, the larger the earthquake,"" she told BBC.

She further noted that ""there have been six magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes in this region in the last century.""

Additionally, this fault's straight alignment allows energy to travel along its length, which stretches 1,200 km southward toward Thailand.

Bangkok's soft soil amplifies seismic waves, slowing them down and increasing their intensity, making the ground shaking more severe.

The earthquake also impacted parts of neighbouring Thailand, causing an under-construction skyscraper to collapse in Bangkok.

Rescue efforts entered their third day as emergency teams, using drones and sniffer dogs, continued searching for survivors. At least 76 people remained trapped beneath the rubble of the collapsed building.

Dramatic footage from Bangkok captured high-rise buildings swaying during the earthquake, with rooftop pools spilling over. However, the only reported skyscraper collapse was the unfinished headquarters of the auditor-general's office in Chatuchak district.

Christian Málaga-Chuquitaype, a senior lecturer in earthquake engineering at Imperial College London, noted that before 2009, Bangkok lacked comprehensive safety standards for earthquake-resistant construction. As a result, older buildings were particularly vulnerable.

This is not uncommon, as constructing earthquake-resistant buildings is often more costly, and Thailand, unlike Myanmar, does not frequently experience major earthquakes.

Emily So, a professor of architectural engineering at the University of Cambridge, pointed out that older buildings can be reinforced, as has been done in California, western Canada, and New Zealand.

Sea of protesters standing against billionaire Elon Musk's actions in the US government under President Donald Trump flocked outside Tesla dealerships across America and in some European cities on Saturday, a part of their latest attempt to put a dent on the SpaceX CEO's fortune.

The protesting crowds are trying to escalate a movement against Musk's Tesla dealerships and vehicles, to oppose his role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), under whose banner the billionaire has accessed sensitive information and moved to shut down whole of agencies while trying to cut down government spending.

The biggest chunk of Elon Musk's estimate fortune of $340 billion consists of his stock in the electric vehicle company, which he continues to run alongside his work with Trump.

Protests had been taking place earlier as well. However, Saturday saw the first mass attempt to surround all 277 showrooms and service centers of Tesla in the US, with the crowds hoping to further down the already declining sales of the electric vehicle company.

A few dozens to hundreds of protesters amassed outside Tesla dealerships in the automaker's home state Texas, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Minnesota, and several other parts of the US. Visuals of the protests went viral on social media, with people raising slogans 'Burn a Tesla, Save Democracy', 'De-Musk America', 'Honk If You Hate Elon', 'Don't Buy Nazi Cars' and many such other posters.

 

Overtime, throughout the day, protesters also began to spread outside Tesla locations in other major US cities like Washington, Chicago, Cincinnati, Seattle, as well as Pennsylvania, Colorado and Virginia towns.



What is being promoted as 'Tesla Takedown' on social media, saw a flash mob protest taking place in Seattle, with protesters raising their slogan placards and posters and dancing outside a dealership outlet of the automaker.

 

Several dozen people were also heard chanting, ""Hey, hey, ho, ho, Elon Musk has to go!"" outside a showroom in Chicago. From youngsters to senior citizens, people from all faces of life were seen protesting against Musk across the US.



Anti-Musk protests outside USThe 'Tesla Takedown' movement rallies protesters outside the US as well. Though the turnout was not as big in European cities, the level of anti-Musk sentiments remained similar. Dozens of posters of Musk making the Nazi salute, a gesture that he has been accused of reprising shortly after President Trump's inauguration on January 20, were put up outside a Tesla dealership in London.

Protesters in the UK also raised posters of 'Don't Buy Nazi Cars', Bankrupt Elon', etc., in their demonstration against Musk's purge of the US government.

Some protesters reportedly have taken a step beyond just demonstrations, setting Tesla vehicles ablaze or committing other acts of vandalism on them, an act which US Attorney General Pam Bondi decried as domestic terrorism.

Earlier, Musk had said that he was dumbfounded by the attacks, adding that the vandals should ""stop acting pyscho"".



Meanwhile, around seven Tesla cars were torched in northwestern Germany early morning, with police launching a prompt probe into it. However, an AP report mentioned that it was not clear whether the fire had anything to do with the protests.

Elon Musk, however, remained confident in this electric vehicle company. Since he took over the DOGE, consumers who previously bought Tesla vehicles were looking to sell or trade them in, while others put up bumper stickers on them seeking to distance themselves from Musk.

In a March meeting, Musk had reassured the workers that Tesla's Model Y would remain the ""best-selling car on Earth again this year"". He predicted that the company would have sold over 10 million cars worldwide by next year, an increase from the current approximate figure of 7 million.

“There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,” Musk had said.

The internet has been captivated by a flood of AI-generated images inspired by the signature style of Studio Ghibli, the legendary Japanese animation studio known for its whimsical, hand-drawn aesthetic. Perfected by Japanese animator and filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, this art form has brought dreamy landscapes and reimagined pop culture characters to life. Social media platforms have been overwhelmed with these AI-created visuals, fueling a viral trend that has taken over feeds worldwide.

As the trend escalated, ChatGPT's image-generation tool became a primary source for these creations, leading to an unprecedented surge in demand. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, took to X (formerly Twitter) to express the impact on the company's resources.

""Can y'all please chill on generating images? This is insane, our team needs sleep,"" Altman posted, highlighting the strain the trend has placed on the platform's servers and engineering team.

 

For those unfamiliar, Studio Ghibli is a world-renowned Japanese animation studio celebrated for its visually stunning and emotionally rich films like Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle. Founded by legendary animators Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, the studio has become synonymous with breathtaking hand-drawn animation, enchanting storytelling, and deeply immersive worlds. Its signature style is characterised by soft, painterly backgrounds, expressive and emotive characters, and a dreamlike, nostalgic atmosphere that evokes a sense of wonder and tranquillity. These elements have now transcended traditional animation, becoming a viral aesthetic on social media, where users are using AI tools to reimagine themselves and familiar scenes in the distinctive Ghibli style.

The name Ghibli comes from a Libyan Arabic word referring to a hot desert wind. These films are meticulously crafted by a dedicated team of artists working under Miyazaki's guidance. The Wind Rises exemplifies this effort, with each frame hand-drawn and painted in watercolours. One particularly intricate scene, depicting a bustling market, took over a year to complete. Last year, Miyazaki was honoured with the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award, often called Asia's Nobel Prize.

David Fincher's American biographical drama film, The Social Network, portrayed the founding of the social networking website Facebook. However, in a recent conversation on Colin and Samir's podcast, Mark Zuckerberg criticised the film's plot, calling it a ""weird experience"" to watch. (Also Read: Why David Fincher turned down directing ‘clean' Harry Potter franchise: ‘I want it to be kind of creepy')

Mark Zuckerberg revealed that he took his entire company to watch the film, and when asked about his experience seeing it, he said, “It was weird, man. They got all these very specific details of what I was wearing, or these specific things correct, but then the whole narrative arc around my motivations and all this stuff was completely wrong.”

Further dismissing the film's plot, he said, “The whole arc is like, I'm somehow motivated by trying to find a girlfriend, [but] I was dating Priscilla before I started Facebook. And then you have this whole stuff about—it's an unfortunate part of the internet—how people make up a lot of the founding mythology to fit what they want. It is true that I made a bunch of other websites and stuff when I was at Harvard, but people cast it as if FaceMash, that prank thing that I made, was the precursor to Facebook, I guess maybe because it has ‘face' in the name. It was completely separate from Facebook.”

Zuckerberg further stated that, even after 21 years, misconceptions about FaceSmash prevail largely due to the film. He noted that many people believe he created the platform as a service to rate individuals' attractiveness, which he dismissed as inaccurate. According to him, he was simply a kid experimenting with various projects at the time.

The 2010 drama is based on the 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich. It stars Jesse Eisenberg as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, with Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, Armie Hammer as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and Max Minghella as Divya Narendra. The film is available to watch on Netflix.

Faye Hall, an American citizen who was detained by Taliban in Afghanistan earlier this year has been released and taken back to the United States in a new diplomatic win for the latter.

Upon reaching her home country back, Hall thanked US President Donald Trump for securing her release and said that she was glad that Trump was President.

Faye Hall is an American citizen who was detained by Taliban in Afghanistan on February 1, along with a British couple and their Afghan translator while they were visiting the country's central Bamiyan province.

Faye Hall was identified by the Taliban interior ministry as Chinese-American. While the reason for her arrest was not certain, a CNN report says that she was detained on charges of operating a drone without authorization.

Along with Hall, a British couple - Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who are in their 70s, and their translator were also arrested while they were travelling to the couple's home in central Bamiyan province. According to a BBC report, the couple had been running training programmes for women and girls in Afghanistan for years, and were among the few westerners who decided to stay there even after Taliban took control. There is no update on their release yet.

After her release, Faye Hall thanked President Trump through a video message shared by the White House. She says in the video that she voted for him twice.

“I am so glad you're in the office. It's the new era. And in this situation, I am glad you're the President, and thank you for bringing me home. I have never been so proud to be an American citizen,” she is heard saying in the video.

The news of Hall's release was first shared by US' former envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalizad, who shared a photo of her in Qatari care. “American citizen Faye Hall, just released by the Taliban, is now in the care of our friends, the Qataris in Kabul, and will soon be on her way home. Thank you, #Qatar, for your ongoing and steadfast partnership,” he said in the post.

While the US doesn't have diplomatic presence in Afghanistan, its interests are represented in the country through Qatar, said the CNN report.

The artform, mastered by Japanese animator and filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, has seeped into everyone's timeline as people rush to ChatGPT to either ‘ghiblify' their existing photos or create fresh imagery in a matter of a few simple prompts.

Amid all of this, one voice that was missing was Studio Ghibli itself. While the studio, responsible for producing masterpieces such as ‘Spirited Away' and ‘Howl's Moving Castle', has still not directly commented on the use of its imagery style to produce AI-generated art, it has joined the conversation to rebut a fake ‘cease and desist' letter making rounds on social media, claiming to be issued by the studio.

While people were busy producing their own versions of Studio Ghibli-inspired images, a post popped up on March 27 on social media platform X, announcing ‘Gib' - a social media platform where every image would be inspired by Studio Ghibli. “Instagram but every photo is Studio Ghibli,” the post said.

Later on the same day, the same account shared a ‘cease and desist' letter claiming to be from “legal representatives of Studio Ghibli”. The letter read that the ‘Gib' app was in violation of copyright laws, as it draws heavily from the artform created by Studio Ghibli. The letter was shared by X user @tj_littlejohn with the caption - “Just got this cease and desist from Studio Ghibli. AI creators deserve protection, not punishment. Expression is sacred. Imagination is not illegal. If I have to be a martyr to prove that, so be it. I'm assembling a legal team. Firms who believe in this fight, reach out”

 

The letter quickly went viral on social media and has prompted a response by the Japanese animation studio, which has confirmed that it has not issued any such letter. Talking to NHK, a local Japanese media outlet, Studio Ghibli said, ""We have not issued a warning letter.""

While the statement from the studio is brief, it debunks the fake narrative being pushed on social media in its name. The community note below the post also reads now that the letter is fake. “This letter is fake. There is no records for a ""Sakura-Hoshino LLP"" ever existing. The email addressed is not valid. Furthermore, the phone number is fake, as evidenced by it including ""555"",” it says.

Later on March 28, the same account shared another post consisting an image of Hayao Miyazaki, co-founder of Ghibli Studios, looking through a peephole, captioned, “ok the app is fake !!”

OpenAI's ChatGPT has gained massive traction over the past week with its brand new feature that allows users to create artwork inspired by Studio Ghibli. However, the feature has not yet been rolled out to free users.

One has to pay an amount per month for ChatGPT subscription to create these Japanese anime style images.

ChatGPT has two premium levels, ChatGPT Plus and Pro. To get a gist of what benefits are included in the premium subscription, here are the things you will get in the free version:

Now, the ChatGPT plus subscription costs $20 per month, which is approximately around ₹1,710/month. The Plus version was rolled out in India back in 2023.

Sam Altman's OpenAI aimed to increase productivity and creativity with expanded access to artificial intelligence (AI) with the Plus version.

Under the Plus version, a user would have access to everything in the free edition. Additionally, a premium subscriber would get:

To further add to the premium features, OpenAI launched another subscription tier for its chatbot, ChatGPT. The new plan, called ChatGPT Pro, is priced at $200 per month, which is roughly ₹17,107/month.

In addition to providing access to every feature under ChatGPT Plus, the Pro version also gives unlimited access to all reasoning models and GPT-4o.

The response time of both the premium versions, Plus and Pro, is much faster in comparison to the free version. The Pro version offers unlimited and expanded access to all the listed features.

The scores of Studio Ghibli-inspired images flooding the timelines of all social media users have been made possible by ChatGPT-4o (short for “Omni”), which OpenAI says is its latest and most advanced AI model.

The model has been put to use by millions of users online for transforming their photos into Studio Ghibli-inspired images, so much so that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that their GPUs were melting. The Japanese animation studio is known for its serene aesthetics and dreamy storytelling.

However, that is not the only advanced feature offered by the latest version of ChatGPT. To understand more about GPT 4o, we asked ChatGPT about some hidden/secret features of 4o image generation.

ChatGPT, one of the most popular AI platform across the world, was quick to list out the lesser-known tricks and optimizations of its latest 4o image generation model-

You can generate images with a transparent background by enabling the transparent background option. This is great for logos, stickers, and compositing.

Want to create a character and keep them consistent across multiple images? You can reference previously generated images to maintain visual similarity.

You can modify parts of an image rather than generating a whole new one. This allows for things like changing colors, adding accessories, or fixing small details.

Using detailed descriptors like ""4K, ultra-detailed, cinematic lighting, volumetric fog"" can push the quality higher. Also, specifying materials (e.g., ""velvet dress"" vs. ""silk dress"") refines textures.

Instead of generating one image at a time, you can request multiple variations at once using the n parameter.

You can guide the image toward a specific art style (e.g., ""Studio Ghibli-style fantasy town"" or ""Picasso-inspired portrait""). It won't be an exact match, but it strongly influences aesthetics.

AI-generated images struggle with text, but using simple, bold words in prompts (like ""a neon sign that says 'OPEN'"") increases the chances of readable text.

While the Trump administration is working with full dedication to impose stricter immigration rules and ensure the deportation of illegal immigrants, it has led to a gap in the job market. The question arises - who is going to take up the essential jobs that were done by deported immigrants, at quite considerable budgets.

Florida, a Republican state known for its many beaches and harsh weather, has come up with a solution that many may not agree with - getting teenagers to join the workforce.

“What's wrong with expecting our young people to be working part-time now? That's how it used to be when I was growing up,” the Guardian quoted Ron deSantis, Florida's governor, as saying.

“Why do we say we need to import foreigners, even import them illegally, when teenagers used to work at these resorts, college students should be [doing] all this stuff,” he added.

A bill that aims to ease laws around child labour was presented by the state legislature on Tuesday. The bill, if passed, will allow teens as young as 14-year-olds to do overnight shifts, doing away with the current restriction on working between 11 pm to 6:30 am for children, reported CNN.

The bill was passed on Tuesday by the Florida Senate's Commerce and Tourism committee with a 5-4 vote. It has to pass through two more relevant committees following which it will be presented to the full Florida Senate for vote, the report added.

The bill, which aims to loosen child labour laws so that can enter the workforce and potentially fill the void left by deported undocumented immigrants, has drawn flak from groups concerned with child labour abuse.

They have expressed concern that the bill potentially means that teens will be treated like adults while their bodies and minds are still developing. “It's essentially treating teens who have developing bodies and minds like adults, and this will allow employers to schedule them for unlimited hours, overnight and without breaks, and this is during the school year,” the Guardian quoted Alexis Tsoukalas as saying. Tsoukalas is a senior policy analyst at an independent research group - Florida Policy Institute (FPI).

He also added that while teenagers can work for some extra income if they wish to, they still require protection which will be taken away if the bill is passed.

A similar child labour law was also passed last year, which allowed additional hours of employment for minors. The bill removed “certain hourly restrictions for minors 16 and 17 years of age to work and provides a new exemption for those minors who are enrolled in an approved virtual instruction program,” says Florida's Department of Business and Professional Regulation.

In 2023, a law was passed in Florida that made it difficult for undocumented immigrants to land jobs in the state. It required the employers who have over 25 employees to check whether all of them were legal citizens, says the CNN report. Even then, concerns were raised regarding the gap in the labour force that law would create.

Referring to it, Florida Immigrant Coalition's spokesperson Thomas Kennedy said that this is a form of “exploiting minors” as the state seeks to pull them into the state's labour force. “We've been saying since 2023 that this is a way for them to exploit minors, it was when they passed this large, anti-immigrant omnibus and the same year that they tried to pass the first law gutting child labor protection,” the Guardian quoted him as saying.

“The only short-term answer to workforce shortages has always been net migration and they'll never go for that because of their politics. So their only answer is to widen the parameters of who can work, and you either go older or you go younger, and they chose to go younger,” he added.

Both Tsoukalas and Kennedy remain hopeful that the bill may not pass the state senate since there are some Republican senators who have expressed their reservations against it, the report added.

The state of Arkansas witnessed a spike in child labor violations last year. According to a report released by Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, the state saw spike of a whopping 266% in child labour violations, from 460 to 1,685 between 2020 to 2023.

AACF's report says that over half the child labour violations between 2020 to 2024 include making teens work for hours longer than legally set. Another big violation included not obtaining an employment certificate to hire teens below 16 years of age.

In 2023, the state governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders passed a bill making it easier to employ children by doing away with obtaining the said certificate, saying that it was “an arbitrary burden on parents to get permission from the government for their child to get a job,” said an NPR report.

Those who don't agree with the bill say that it takes away teens' protection from exploitation.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened Iran with bombings and secondary tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear program.

In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump said U.S. and Iranian officials were talking but did not elaborate.

""If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing,"" Trump said. ""But there's a chance that if they don't make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago.""

In his first 2017-21 term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that placed strict limits on Tehran's disputed nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.

Trump also reimposed sweeping U.S. sanctions. Since then the Islamic Republic has far surpassed the agreed limits in its escalating program of uranium enrichment.

Tehran has so far rebuffed Trump's warning to make a deal or face military consequences.

Iran sent a response through Oman to Trump's letter in which he urged Tehran to reach a new nuclear deal, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi was cited as saying by the official IRNA news agency on Thursday.

Western powers accuse Iran of having an clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons capability by enriching uranium to a high level of fissile purity, above what they say is justifiable for a civilian atomic energy program.

Tehran says its nuclear program is wholly for civilian energy purposes.

At least one person was killed after a small plane flying from Iowa to Minnesota in the United States crashed into a house in a Minneapolis suburb Saturday. The house caught fire after the aircraft crashed into it and was destroyed, but its residents were not hurt, Brooklyn Park spokesperson Risikat Adesaogun said.

Investigators said it was not yet known how many people were aboard the single-engine SOCATA TBM7 aircraft, but reports said there were no survivors among the passengers.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the aircraft departed from the Des Moines International Airport with a destination of the Anoka County-Blaine Airport, located in another Minneapolis suburb. It crashed in Brooklyn Park, a suburb of Minneapolis. The city of 82,000 people lies about 11 miles to the north of the incident.

The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.

Videos of the crash on social media show the aircraft free-falling from the sky before crashing into the residential area.

Israel began an all-out operation in Gaza in October 2023, with the objective to uproot Hamas.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel's intensified military pressure on Hamas in Gaza has been effective, stressing the Palestinian group must lay down its arms.

""We are negotiating under fire... We can see cracks beginning to appear"" in what the group demanded in its negotiations, Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting.

Netanyahu's remarks came as mediators -- Egypt, Qatar, and the United States -- continued efforts to broker a ceasefire and secure the release of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.

A senior Hamas official stated on Saturday that the group had approved a new ceasefire proposal put forward by mediators and urged Israel to support it.

Netanyahu's office confirmed receipt of the proposal and said Israel had submitted a counterproposal.

However, the details of the latest mediation efforts remain undisclosed.

On Sunday, Netanyahu rejected claims Israel was not interested in discussing a deal that would secure the release of hostages still held in Gaza, but insisted Hamas must surrender its weapons.



""We are willing. Hamas must lay down its arms... Its leaders will be allowed to leave"" from Gaza, he said.

He said that Israel would ensure overall security in Gaza and ""enable the implementation of the Trump plan -- the voluntary migration plan"".

Days after taking office, US President Donald Trump had announced a plan that would relocate Gaza's more than two million inhabitants to neighbouring Egypt and Jordan.

His announcement was slammed by much of the international community.

A fragile truce that had provided weeks of relative calm in the Gaza Strip collapsed on March 18 when Israel resumed its aerial bombardment and ground offensive in the Palestinian territory.

On Sunday, an Israeli air strike killed at least eight people in Gaza's Khan Yunis area, including five children, the territory's civil defence agency reported.

A test rocket aimed at kickstarting satellite launches from Europe fell to the ground and exploded 40 seconds after takeoff from a Norwegian space port on Sunday, in what German startup Isar Aerospace had described as an initial test.

The uncrewed Spectrum rocket was billed as the first attempt at an orbital flight to originate from Europe, where several nations, including Sweden and Britain, have said they want a share of a growing market for commercial space missions.

Isar Aerospace, which had warned that the initial launch could end prematurely, said the test produced extensive data that its team can learn from.



Blasting off from Norway's Arctic Andoeya Spaceport, the Spectrum is designed for small and medium-sized satellites weighing up to one metric tonne, although it did not carry a payload on its maiden voyage.

The footage showed a couple floating on inflatable loungers in the water when earthquake struck.

Water violently surged in a rooftop infinity pool at a Bangkok hotel as tremors from Myanmar's powerful 7.7-magnitude earthquake rocked the region on Friday. A now-viral video captured the terrifying moment when the calm swimming pool turned into a turbulent disaster.

The footage showed a man lounging by the poolside while a couple floated on inflatable loungers in the water. As the earthquake struck, the water began to ripple. Within seconds, massive waves formed, violently sloshing over the pool's edges. Follow Myanmar-Bangkok Earthquake Live Updates here

The man on the deck urgently gestured for the couple to get out, making the couple abandon their floaties and quickly swim toward the pool's edge. The woman reached first, pulling herself out as water continued to crash against the deck. The man followed. Within moments, the surging waves drenched the entire area, flooding the lounge chairs and sending torrents of water cascading off the rooftop and onto the streets below.

Similar scenes were seen across Thailand and Myanmar, where rooftop pools in high-rise buildings turned into waterfalls. The force of the quake sent entire pools' worth of water pouring down skyscrapers, drenching roads and catching pedestrians off guard. Some people were even swept off their feet as sudden waves crashed onto the streets.

The earthquake, the most powerful to hit Myanmar in over a century, struck at 12:50 pm local time. The 7.7-magnitude quake had its epicenter in central Myanmar, with tremors felt as far as Thailand, China, India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. A massive 6.4-magnitude aftershock followed.

At least 1,644 people are confirmed dead, and over 3,400 injured, with the numbers expected to rise. Buildings have collapsed, roads have split open, and thousands are believed to be trapped under the rubble. Emergency teams are struggling to reach affected areas, with communication lines severed and infrastructure severely damaged.

While Myanmar bore the brunt of the devastation, Thailand also suffered significant damage. In Bangkok, at least 10 people have been reported dead, with dozens injured and many missing.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, was down for several users on Sunday with its servers overwhelmed by a surge in demand for its new Studio Ghibli-style image generation feature.

However, the developer soon updated saying all impacted services have been ""fully recovered"".

Reports of the outage began surfacing Saturday evening, leaving several users unable to access the service for a considerable period, but escalated on Sunday around 4 pm, with users flocking to social media to express their frustration.

""We are sorry, an error occurred. Please retry after a few minutes.

""It seems this application has become very popular, and its available rate limit has been reached. Please retry after a few minutes,"" users saw this popup when trying to access the platform.

OpenAI acknowledged the server crash, and later updated that services have been restored. It showed that the ChatGPT web was the most affected.

""We have identified that users are experiencing elevated errors for the impacted services. We are working on implementing a mitigation,"" OpenAI acknowledged.

Downdetector, a website that monitors online service disruptions, showed a massive spike in reported problems with OpenAI, starting around 4.19 pm on Sunday, with 219 reports.

""All impacted services have now fully recovered. The detailed Root Cause Analysis (RCA) will be published in the next 5 business days,"" OpenAI said in an update.

The server overload of ChatGPT was significantly influenced by the release of a new feature that allowed users to generate images in the style of Studio Ghibli, a renowned Japanese animation studio.

This feature quickly gained immense popularity, prompting a surge in user activity as people flocked to experiment with the tool.

""can yall please chill on generating images this is insane our team needs sleep,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X.

The outage affected users globally, preventing them from accessing ChatGPT for various tasks, ranging from content creation to coding assistance.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has called for a pause as social media is overrun with AI-generated Studio Ghibli-style images.

For decades, Studio Ghibli's hand-drawn animation has captivated audiences with its dreamy, nostalgic worlds. Now, thanks to OpenAI's latest image generation tool in ChatGPT, that signature aesthetic is everywhere - on profile pictures, memes, and even reimagined movie posters.

As the trend exploded, Sam Altman posted on X, asking users to ""please chill on generating images,"" calling the demand ""insane"" and saying that the ""team needs sleep.""

can yall please chill on generating images this is insane our team needs sleep

When a user jokingly suggested firing the team behind the feature, Mr Altman defended them, saying, ""No thanks. In addition to building AGI, this team is on trajectory to build the biggest website in the world from a cold start 2.33 years ago. Best team in the world.""



""It's just hard,"" he added.

no thanksin addition to building agi this team is on trajectory to build the biggest website in the world from a cold start 2.33 years agobest team in the world, it's just hard

To manage the surge, OpenAI has introduced restrictions on image generation. Paid subscribers, including ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and Select users, still have access, but free-tier users - who previously had unlimited generations - will now be capped at three images per day.

When another user asked about updated timelines for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Sam Altman responded, ""it will come sooner if you stop using our gpus to make images.""

it will come sooner if you stop using our gpus to make images...

On Thursday, Mr Altman announced temporary rate limits, explaining that the company's GPUs (graphics processing units) were ""melting"" under the pressure. He assured users that the team was working on making the tool more efficient, saying, ""Hopefully won't be long.""

Despite the growing excitement, the rollout has had its challenges. OpenAI had to delay free user access and fix a bug that caused inconsistent image generation.

The company describes GPT-4o as its ""most advanced image generator yet,"" offering improved accuracy, better text rendering, and more precise object relationships. Unlike DALL-E, which generates images in a single pass, GPT-4o constructs them step by step for enhanced realism.

A day before announcing the restrictions, Mr Altman joked about the irony of his journey - spending years developing superintelligence, only to wake up to hundreds of messages showcasing AI-generated, Ghibli-style versions of himself.

Embracing the trend, he even updated his profile picture to an AI-crafted Ghibli-style portrait.

Eight bodies have been pulled from the debris so far. Follow Myanmar-Bangkok Earthquake Live Updates here

Despite Bangkok's skyline being filled with high-rise buildings under construction, no other projects suffered similar destruction. Experts and officials are now questioning the structural integrity of the collapsed building, which belonged to Thailand's State Audit Office (SAO) and had been under construction for three years at a reported cost of over two billion baht (45 million pounds).

Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has ordered an urgent investigation, giving an expert panel seven days to determine the cause of the collapse.

According to a report by the UK's Telegraph, the SAO building was a joint venture between Italian-Thai Development Plc (ITD) and China Railway Number 10 (Thailand) Ltd. The latter is a subsidiary of China Railway Number 10 Engineering Group Company, which holds a 49 per cent stake - the maximum foreign ownership allowed under Thai law.

China Railway Number 10 Thailand, established in 2018, has operated as a contractor for large infrastructure projects, including office buildings, railways, and public roads, the report claimed. The company reported a net loss of 199.66 million baht in 2023, with revenue of 206.25 million baht and expenses of 354.95 million baht.

Its Thai shareholders include: Sophon Meechai (40.80%), who also holds stakes in five other companies; Prachuab Sirikhet (10.20%), with investments in six companies; Manas Sri-anant (less than 1%), who holds shares in ten other firms.

Beyond Bangkok, the earthquake caused devastation across Myanmar, where over 1,600 people have been confirmed dead, and thousands more injured. The tremors, which originated northwest of Sagaing, demolished buildings and infrastructure across Mandalay, one of Myanmar's largest cities.

Myanmar's junta leader, Min Aung Hlaing, issued a rare international plea for aid, a stark departure from the regime's usual stance of rejecting foreign assistance. The country has declared a state of emergency across six regions, and hospitals are overwhelmed with casualties.

In Thailand, the earthquake forced the evacuation of hospitals and office towers. Even in areas where buildings remained standing, footage captured rooftop swimming pools spilling their water down high-rises as the tremors rippled through the city.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The stench of decaying dead bodies permeated the air in Mandalay-- Myanmar's second-largest city-- on Sunday as rescuers worked frantically to clear rubble in the hope of finding people still alive, two days after a massive earthquake killed at least 1,700 people and left countless others buried. The initial 7.7-magnitude quake struck midday Friday with an epicenter near Mandalay, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.

The strong tremors downed collapsed buildings, downed bridges, buckled roads and damaged other infrastructure in the city of more than 1.7 million people. The quake also jolted neighbouring Thailand, where at least 17 in Bangkok.

Most residents in Mandalay spent the night sleeping on the streets, either left homeless by the quake or worried that the continuing aftershocks might cause structures left unstable to collapse. A 5.1 magnitude aftershock Sunday afternoon prompted screams from those in the streets, and then the work continued.

Satellite images of Myanmar show the aftermath of the earthquake that damaged critical infrastructure, including airports, highways, and bridges, hindering the delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid.

Footage from Naypyitaw International Airport shows that its control tower fell due to strong jolts. Due to damage at the airport, flights carrying rescue teams from India and China had to land at the airport in Yangon instead of going directly to the major stricken cities of Mandalay and Naypyitaw.

The Inwa Bridge over the Irrawaddy River near Mandalay have also collapsed, the images showed.

Relief efforts have been hampered by buckled roads, rails and bridges, spotty communications and the challenges of operating in a country in the midst of a civil war.

The search for survivors has been primarily conducted by the local residents without the aid of heavy equipment, moving rubble by hand and with shovels in 41-degree Celsius (106 Fahrenheit) heat, with only the occasional tracked excavator to be seen, according to a report by Associated Press.

Myanmar's ruling junta said in a statement Sunday afternoon that about 1,700 people were confirmed dead so far, about 3,400 injured and around 300 more missing.

But the true scale of the disaster remains unclear in the isolated military-ruled state, and the toll is expected to rise significantly.

Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing also issued an exceptionally rare appeal for international aid on Friday, indicating the severity of the calamity. Previous military governments have shunned foreign assistance, even after major natural disasters.

Myanmar has already been ravaged by four years of civil war sparked by a military coup in 2021. Anti-junta fighters in the country have declared a two-week partial ceasefire in quake-affected regions starting Sunday, the shadow ""National Unity Government"" said in a statement.

Across the border in Thailand, rescuers in Bangkok worked Sunday to pluck out survivors trapped when a 30-storey skyscraper under construction collapsed after the Friday earthquake.

At least 17 people have been killed in the Thai capital, city authorities said on Sunday, with 32 injured and 83 still missing.

After a devastating earthquake ravaged Myanmar, India initiated its relief and rescue efforts in the country under the banner 'Operation Brahma'. On Saturday, the country deployed two naval ships and began the deployment of an army field hospital with 118 medical personnel to provide immediate assistance to the injured. The massive earthquake that devastated Myanmar and neighbouring Thailand killed over 1,600 people and caused widespread destruction.

Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal announced yesterday that two Indian naval ships carrying relief materials were on their way to Myanmar, with two more to follow. The first ship, carrying 10 tonnes of relief supplies, set sail in the early hours of Saturday, while the second ship departed later in the afternoon. They are expected to arrive in Yangon by March 31.

The additional two ships, stationed at Sri Vijaya Puram under the Andaman and Nicobar Command, will follow in the coming days to reinforce India's aid efforts.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar provided updates on social media, stating, ""INS Satpura & INS Savitri are carrying 40 tonnes of humanitarian aid and headed for the port of Yangon.""

The Air Force has also been actively engaged in deploying relief supplies and personnel. Mr Jaiswal confirmed that multiple aircraft have been deployed under Operation Brahma. The first aircraft, carrying 15 tonnes of relief material, took off at 3 AM from Hindon Air Force Base in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad, reaching Yangon by 8 AM. Indian ambassador to Myanmar Abhay Thakur handed over the supplies, including tents, blankets, food packets, and essential medicines, to Yangon's chief minister.

Two more aircraft, carrying search and rescue teams, departed for Myanmar, with an additional two aircraft forming part of the 118-member army field hospital unit's deployment. This elite medical team, from the Indian Army's Shatrujeet Brigade Medical Responders, led by Lieutenant Colonel Jagneet Gill, will provide advanced medical and surgical care. They will establish a 60-bed Medical Treatment Centre in Mandalay to handle trauma cases, emergency surgeries, and general medical needs.

India has also dispatched an 80-member National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team equipped with specialist search and rescue tools, including concrete cutters, drill machines, and canine squads. The team will be stationed in Nay Pyi Taw to assist local authorities in finding survivors trapped under debris.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke with General Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar's military leader, offering condolences and assuring full support. ""As a close friend and neighbour, India stands in solidarity with the people of Myanmar in this difficult hour,"" PM Modi stated on social media.

Mr Jaiswal reiterated India's commitment to being a ""first responder"" to natural disasters in the region, citing previous aid missions such as 'Operation Dost' in Turkey and Syria. ""When we say Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, we mean it, and we prove it through action,"" he said, referring to India's ethos of 'the world is one family'.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

An earthquake of magnitude 7.1 hit the Tonga Islands on Sunday, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The shallow quake hit 90 kilometres (56 miles) southeast of the village of Pangai, with warnings also extending to the island nation of Niue.

The US Tsunami Warning Center issued an alert, cautioning that ""tsunami waves reaching 0.3 to 1 meters above the tide level are possible for some coasts of Niue... and Tonga.

It had earlier warned that ""hazardous tsunami waves from this earthquake are possible within 300 kilometres of the epicentre along the coasts of Tonga"".

Authorities in Tonga issued a warning to residents to stay away from beaches and shorelines. ""People living in the low-lying coastal areas, please move to higher grounds or further inland,"" the Tonga National Disaster Risk Management Office wrote on Facebook.



As of now, there are no immediate reports of damage or casualties.

Tonga is a Polynesian kingdom in the South Pacific, consisting of over 170 islands that boast white sandy beaches, coral reefs, and dense tropical rainforests. It is more than 3,500 kilometers (2,000 miles) off of Australia's east coast.

Earthquakes are common in Tonga, a low-lying archipelago home to around 100,000 people that straddles the seismic Ring of Fire-- an arc of intense tectonic activity that stretches through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.

This powerful earthquake follows a recent series of seismic activities in the region, highlighting the ongoing geological volatility of the South Pacific area. On Friday, a 7.7 magnitude quake hit Myanmar midday with an epicenter near Mandalay, bringing down scores of buildings and damaging other infrastructure like the city's airport.

Amid US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariff threats, Indian and US officials held talks in New Delhi this week to discuss trade issues, including tariff reduction and easing of non-tariff barriers. The two sides also decided to hold sectoral talks under the proposed bilateral trade agreement (BTA) in the coming weeks, India's commerce ministry said on Saturday. 

Washington and New Delhi aim to sign the first tranche of a bilateral trade deal by autumn (September-October). They have also set a target to more than double bilateral trade to $ 500 billion by 2030 from the current over $ 190 billion.

The negotiations, held from March 26-29, were led by officials from India's commerce ministry and a US trade delegation headed by Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia Brendan Lynch.

""The successful conclusion of the discussions reflects progress in efforts to expand India-U.S. bilateral trade and investment relations to promote prosperity, security and innovation in both countries,"" a statement by India's commerce ministry said.

""Sectoral expert-level engagements under the BTA will start virtually in the coming weeks and pave the path for an early negotiating round in person,"" it added.

Separately, US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau also spoke with Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri about efforts to reduce trade barriers and achieve a ""fair and balanced bilateral trade relationship"", while also strengthening defence and technology cooperation to bolster regional security.

Landau thanked India for its efforts in addressing illegal immigration to the United States and urged continued cooperation, the U.S. Department of State said in a statement.

The talks come as US President Donald Trump prepares to impose reciprocal tariffs on multiple trading partners from April 2, with India hoping for an exemption amid the bilateral talks. The tariff threats loom over India, as the US President has repeatedly branded New Delhi a ""tariff king"" and a ""big abuser"" of trade ties. 

The problem is that India's trade-weighted import duties-- some of the highest in the world. The US currently has a $45.6 billion trade deficit with India. While the US trade-weighted average tariff rate stands at about 2.2 per cent, India's average tariff is significantly higher at 12 per cent, according to World Trade Organization data.

Washington wants New Delhi to reduce levies on products ranging from agricultural goods and alcoholic beverages to automobiles, and seeks greater market access for US companies.

Working in this direction, last month, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Washington, India pledged to boost purchases of US energy products and defence equipment, and the two sides agreed to aim for a deal targeting bilateral trade of $500 billion by 2030. Piyush Goyal, India's trade minister, also visited Washington earlier this month for talks with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

On Friday, US President Donald Trump described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a ""very smart man"" and a ""great friend of mine"" while emphasising that tariff talks would ""work out very well between India and our country"".

The remarks assume significance since Trump has repeatedly criticised the alleged high tariffs charged by India and other countries on American goods. 

""India is one of the highest-tariffing nations in the world. It's brutal, it's brutal. They're very smart. He (Modi) is a very smart man and a great friend of mine. We had very good talks. I think it's going to work out very well between India and our country,"" he said.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

A woman has filed a lawsuit against American Airlines, alleging that a cabin crew member dismissed her complaints after a male passenger masturbated next to her for nearly an hour during a flight.

Neel Elsherif, CEO of multiple companies including luxury vegan leather brand Mela, claims the incident occurred on a May 27 journey from New York's JFK Airport to Milan. According to the lawsuit filed in Brooklyn Federal Court, the man - identified only as ""John Doe"" - was drunk after consuming multiple glasses of champagne. Ms Elsherif noticed him rubbing his groin over his pants before the situation escalated, The NY Post reported, citing the legal filing.

As the cabin lights dimmed, John Doe allegedly continued masturbating for about 60 minutes. ""John Doe continued to masturbate . . . and during that time neither the Flight Attendant nor another AA crew member walked through the Premium Economy cabin,"" the lawsuit says. Frozen in her seat, Ms Elsherif feared for her safety and hoped a crew member would intervene.

When the man finally stopped, Ms Elsherif reported the misconduct to a flight attendant - only to be met with indifference, she claims. The lawsuit says the crew member told her there was ""nothing really that [she] could do"" and suggested she move to coach instead.

Ms Elsherif, who had paid over $3,000 (over Rs 2.5 lakh) for her seat, protested. The flight attendant allegedly responded, ""Men just do stuff like that,"" adding that her own husband ""did stuff like that"" as well.

""The flight crew failed to report the incident and did not even speak to John Doe,"" the legal filing reads.

Ms Elsherif, who is of Arab and Middle Eastern descent, also alleges racial bias in the airline's handling of the situation. She claims that because she is an Arab woman, her report was not treated as a case of sexual assault, as per People Magazine.

""The flight attendant gave John Doe preferential treatment over [her] and treated John Doe's safety, comfort, and convenience more importantly than [hers], because John Doe is a white male,"" the lawsuit states.

After moving to coach, Ms Elsherif says she saw the same flight attendant continuing to serve John Doe champagne and engaging in friendly conversation with him.

Her attorneys are seeking damages for negligence, discrimination, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

American Airlines, in a statement to People Magazine, said, ""American strives to provide a positive experience to everyone who travels with us. We are reviewing the allegations of the complaint.""","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, are set to marry in Italy's Venice this year, multiple reports have said.

While the city's romantic canals and historic charm make it a dream wedding destination, even one of the world's richest people may not get a chance to experience the best views directly from their yacht.

According to Venice's rules and regulations, big ships are not allowed to come too close to historical places such as St. Mark's Square, the Grand Canal, the Giudecca Canal, the Bridge of Sighs, and the Rialto Bridge.

Venice has strict maritime rules after UNESCO warned that the city could be placed on the ""Endangered"" list due to the damage caused by the large ships.



Mr Bezos's yacht weighs 3,493 gross tons, much less than the set limit of 25,000 for ships to enter Venice's lagoon. Although his yacht meets the general weight limit, it is still too large to enter the Grand Canal.

The couple has nearly fully reserved five major luxury hotels, including the Grand Aman Hotel, where American actor George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin celebrated their wedding in 2014, along the Grand Canal for the last weekend of June, CNN reported.

They have also reportedly booked the Gritti Palace, the Belmond Hotel Cipriani, the St. Regis Venice, and the Hotel Danieli.

Mr Bezos and Ms Sanchez have also booked an exclusive fleet of private water taxis, including the renowned ""Amore"" that Mr Clooney and Ms Alamuddin used to leave the wedding location.

The couple will reportedly tie the knot on June 26 on a $500 million superyacht, Koru, in the presence of Hollywood celebrities and top politicians. 

US President Donald Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, Kim Kardashian, Gayle King, Katy Perry, Eva Longoria, Kris Jenner, Karlie Kloss and her husband Joshua Kushner, Leonardo DiCaprio and Bill Gates are reportedly among those likely to attend the wedding.

Jeff Bezos married MacKenzie Scott in 1993 and got divorced in 2019 after 25 years of marriage. The couple has four kids together.

At least 1,644 people have died, and more than 3,400 have been injured after a powerful 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar on Friday. The quake's tremors were felt across several neighbouring countries, including Thailand, China, India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. Amid the devastation, CCTV footage from a hospital in China's Yunnan shows two maternity ward nurses risking their lives to protect newborns as the earthquake violently shook the facility.

The video, now widely shared on social media, shows a ward filled with cradles carrying infants when the tremors began. The violent shaking caused the wheeled beds to roll uncontrollably across the room. One nurse, seated on the floor cradling a baby, instinctively grabbed a bassinet to stop it from being flung away. The second nurse, standing nearby, quickly moved to steady two cribs swaying under the impact.

As the quake intensified, a water filter shook violently, spilling water all over the floor. The nurses struggled to maintain their balance on the wet floor while making sure the infants remained unharmed. The first nurse, dragged across the floor by the force of the tremors, clutched the infant tightly while using her other arm to stop the cradles from crashing into each other.

The White House Correspondents' Association dropped the comedian who was to headline its annual dinner, the body said Saturday, amid tensions with US President Donald Trump, who has targeted multiple outlets over their coverage.

The comedian, Amber Ruffin, has previously criticised Trump and joked that no one would want to attend next month's dinner with him.

A White House spokesman had criticized her and the WHCA over her appearance at the dinner, traditionally headlined by a comedian who makes fun of whoever is president at the time.

WHCA president Eugene Daniels said in a Saturday email to members that the board unanimously decided that ""we are no longer featuring a comedic performance this year.""



""At this consequential moment for journalism, I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of division but entirely on awarding our colleagues for their outstanding work and providing scholarship and mentorship to the next generation of journalists,"" Daniels said.

He said he would give further details as the April 26 dinner nears.

A White House spokesman called the decision ""a cop out.""

Trump's team has clashed with the WHCA, an independent body representing journalists covering the White House, since his return to power in January.

In February it stripped the WHCA of the nearly century-old power to decide which of them cover US presidential events, with Trump boasting that he was now ""calling the shots"" on media access.

His administration said the WHCA would no longer have a ""monopoly"" on choosing members of the ""press pool.""

The press pool is a small group of reporters that covers the US president in often cramped spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One, and shares their material with other news organizations.

The WHCA -- of which AFP is a member -- said the decision ""tears at the independence of the free press.""

The White House has also banned reporters from the Associated Press news agency from the Oval Office and travelling on Air Force One since February.

It did so because the AP continues to refer to the Gulf of Mexico, an international body of water, and not simply the ""Gulf of America"" as decreed by Trump.

The AP has filed a suit against three White House officials arguing that the denial of access violates the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and of the press.

US President Donald Trump declared on Saturday that he ""couldn't care less"" if automakers increase car prices for Americans in the wake of his imposition of import tariffs.

There have been reports that Trump threatened auto executives with reprisals if prices jump, but he told NBC News that increasing prices would simply help US-based manufacturers.

""I couldn't care less. I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty,"" he told NBC host Kristen Welker.

On Thursday, Trump imposed a blanket 25 percent import tariff on cars and light trucks made outside the United States, due to take effect on April 3.

Tariffs will be delayed for car parts from countries covered by US trade pact with Mexico and Canada as officials try to disentangle the mixed supply chain.

But otherwise Trump intends for the import levy to be permanent, in order to boost US production and, in his view, save the American auto industry.

Despite his boosterism, however, share prices of the biggest US automakers have suffered and experts have warned that price rises will hit American consumers.

Asked by NBC News what his message would be to worried auto executives, Trump said: ""The message is 'congratulations.'""

Controversial social media personality Andrew Tate's former girlfriend, model Brianna Stern, has accused him of sexual assault and physical abuse during their relationship. According to the civil suit, filed in Los Angeles, Ms Stern claimed she was both physically and emotionally mistreated over 10 months. She has also sought a restraining order against Tate, The Independent reported.

Tate's legal team has denied the accusations. His lawyer, Joseph McBride, said the claims were financially motivated.

“We stand ready to defend Andrew fiercely in court, where the truth will expose this baseless scheme. Instead of seeking a private resolution, Ms Stern has chosen to air her false claims in the press, revealing her true motives: money and attention, not justice,” the English news outlet quoted him as saying.

In a long thread on X (formerly Twitter), Ms Stern shared her chats and experiences with the influencer. In one post, Ms Stern shared a screengrab of one of her chats with Tate in which he writes to her, ""You'll give me a child this year, bit*h."" 

“YOU ARE MY PROPERTY”My name is Bri Stern. I'm from Los Angeles California. I met Andrew Tate in the summer of 2024 and we were in a relationship for almosta year. ￼ pic.twitter.com/IfSaQImJMM

According to court documents, Ms Stern alleged the incident occurred in March at the Beverly Hills Motel. The filing stated that an initially consensual encounter allegedly turned violent.

“Tate began verbally degrading Plaintiff as he routinely did — but this time it was much worse, more aggressive, and more violent. Tate then began to choke Plaintiff (Stern),” the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit added that Ms Stern cried and begged Tate to stop, but he allegedly continued choking her to the point where she nearly lost consciousness. It also detailed allegations that he struck her repeatedly and issued threats against her life.

“While doing so, Tate told her repeatedly that if she ever crossed him, he was going to kill her,” the court filing said.

Ms Stern reportedly sought medical treatment following the incident and was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome. She filed the lawsuit after Tate left the United States.

The model has spoken publicly about the lawsuit, explaining her reasons for coming forward. She shared her statement on Instagram, saying, “The entire situation is very traumatic and extremely difficult. I considered many times just silently leaving Andrew and saying nothing, doing nothing, because I was scared, and it was honestly hard for me to accept that I was being abused. But I can now see that doing so would be the cowardly approach.”

The legal action also alleged a broader pattern of emotional abuse and manipulation. Ms Stern claimed she first met Tate in 2024 after travelling to Romania for a modelling job and was initially drawn to his apparent generosity. She alleged that his behaviour soon became controlling and abusive, describing how he would refer to her as his “property"".

""The last time I saw Andrew was on March 11, 2025 at the Beverly Hills Hotel. The last words he said to me before I left the hotel were: 'Shut the f*ck up, bitch. You will never backtalk me. You are my property',"" she said in a statement. Here's Brianna Stern's complete statement:

Tate is currently facing additional legal troubles in multiple countries. Earlier this week, he reported to a police station in Romania following his return to the country. He and his brother, Tristan Tate, recently travelled to the US on a private jet after restrictions on their movement imposed due to a human trafficking investigation were lifted.

In Romania, the brothers are facing multiple charges, including human trafficking, sexual relations with a minor and money laundering. Another case, involving allegations of forming a criminal organisation to sexually exploit women, has been sent back to prosecutors.

Tate is also set to be extradited to the UK, where authorities in Bedfordshire have issued a European arrest warrant related to further allegations of rape and human trafficking, dating back to 2012-2015.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Fast fashion giant H&M is facing intense scrutiny after announcing plans to create digital clones of its models using artificial intelligence (AI) tools. The Swedish company said it will initially create 30 AI doppelgangers of its models, to be used in social media posts and marketing campaigns instead of real humans.

As per a BBC report, the clothing retailer said the models would retain rights over the digital replicas and their use by the company and other brands for marketing and other purposes. It added that models will be compensated for the use of their digital twins in a similar way to current arrangements.

""We are curious to explore how to showcase our fashion in new creative ways - and embrace the benefits of new technology - while staying true to our commitment to personal style,"" H&M's chief creative officer Jorgen Andersson in a statement.

Since social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok require users to disclose the use of AI to create realistic content, the H&M posts will have a watermark, informing the audience about its usage of generative AI.

As the news went viral, social media users slammed H&M stating that the move will eat into the job opportunities for hundreds of workers that are involved in a typical product photoshoot.

""I'm sorry, are any of the models, photographers, agents and consumers going to be happy with this?"" said one user while another added: ""The AI 'dead Internet' theory is basically coming. Every time you throw up a screen, nothing will be authentic anymore.""

A third commented: ""Ew. Classic AI move. At least it helps me weed out more garbage corporations.""

Notably, H&M is not the first brand to explore the use of AI for its marketing campaign. Fashion firms including Hugo Boss and Levi Strauss & Co have previously talked about using generative AI for product images.

Jeans maker Levi's said in 2023 that it would trial the use of AI-generated model images as a way to ""increase diversity"". Following criticism, it clarified it would not scale back live photoshoots with models.

In July last year, Spanish brand Mango launched a campaign generated entirely by AI to promote a new collection of its youth range.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

A top Hamas official said on Saturday the group approved a new Gaza ceasefire proposal put forth by mediators, urging Israel to back it but warning the Iran-backed group's weapons were a ""red line"".

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed it had also received a proposal from the mediators and had submitted a counter-proposal in response.

""Two days ago, we received a proposal from the mediating brothers in Egypt and Qatar. We dealt with it positively and approved it. We hope that the occupation (Israel) will not obstruct it,"" Khalil al-Haya said in a televised address for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr.

""The weapons of the resistance are a red line,"" he added.

Netanyahu's office confirmed it had received a proposal from mediators.

""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, yesterday, held a series of consultations pursuant to the proposal that was received from the mediators,"" his office said in a statement.

""A few hours ago, Israel conveyed to the mediators a counter-proposal in full coordination with the US,"" it said without elaborating.

A day earlier, senior Hamas official Bassem Naim had said talks between the Palestinian Islamist movement and mediators over a ceasefire deal were gaining momentum as Israel continues intensive operations in Gaza.

Palestinian sources close to Hamas had told AFP that talks began Thursday evening between the militant group and mediators from Egypt and Qatar to revive a ceasefire and hostage release deal.

The fragile truce that had brought weeks of relative calm to the Gaza Strip ended on March 18 when Israel resumed its bombing campaign across the territory.

The talks in Doha started a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to seize parts of Gaza if Hamas did not release hostages, and Hamas warned the captives would return ""in coffins"" if Israel did not stop bombing the Palestinian territory.

Leaders call on federal authorities to explain actions after University of Minnesota student detained on Thursday

Officials in Minnesota were seeking answers in the case of a University of Minnesota graduate student who was being detained by US immigration authorities for unknown reasons.

University leadership said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detained the student on Thursday at an off-campus residence. Officials said the school was not given advance notice about the detention and did not share information with federal authorities. The student's name and nationality have not been released.

As the case remained largely a mystery, state and local leaders called on federal authorities to explain their actions.

“My office and I are doing all we can to get information about this concerning case,” the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar said in a post on the social media site X. “We're in contact with the University and understand they had no prior warning or information that led to this detainment.”

She said that international students are “a major part of the fabric of life in the school and our community”.

The detained student was enrolled in business school at the university's Twin Cities campus. University officials said the school was providing the student with legal aid and other support services.

What prompted the detention is still unknown. Ice officials have not responded to an Associated Press email requesting comment.

The Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, said on X that he was in touch with the US Department of Homeland Security.

“The University of Minnesota is an international destination for education and research,” Walz wrote. “We have any number of students studying here with visas, and we need answers.”

The Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, also called the case “deeply troubling”.

“Educational environments must be places where all students can focus on learning and growing without fear,” he wrote on X.

Officials promised to release more information about the case once they had updates.

US immigration authorities have been targeting people with ties to American colleges and universities as President Donald Trump seeks to crackdown on immigrants. Most of the detainees have shown support for Palestinian causes.

The Trump administration has cited a seldom-invoked statute authorizing the secretary of state to revoke visas of noncitizens who could be considered a threat to foreign policy interests. More than half a dozen people are known to have been taken into custody or deported in recent weeks.

In Minneapolis, the university's graduate labor union organized a protest on Saturday outside the US citizenship and immigration services office downtown, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune. Dozens of people joined the rally to stand in solidarity with international students facing uncertain futures under the new Trump administration.

“International students are huge assets to the University of Minnesota,” Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota said in a Facebook post. “They move thousands of miles away from their families and support systems to learn from the best and the brightest. I can't imagine how terrified they are after learning ICE has detained one of their classmates.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Alexander Stubb – who played golf with Trump this weekend – suggested deadline and US sanctions package

Donald Trump is losing patience with Vladimir Putin's stalling tactics over the Ukraine ceasefire, the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, said after spending nine hours with the US president – including winning a golf competition with him at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Saturday.

Stubb, who also spent two days with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, last week in Helsinki suggested in a Guardian interview a plan for a deadline of 20 April, by which time Putin should be required to comply with a full ceasefire.
 Stubb pointed out that a third golf partner on Saturday, the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, already has a bill in the US Senate proposing what he has described as “bone-breaking” US sanctions on Russia if it did not accept an unconditional ceasefire.

The round of golf diplomacy seemed to make a positive impression on Trump, who wrote afterwards on his Truth Social platform: “I just played a round of Golf with Alexander Stubb, President of Finland. He is a very good player, and we won the Men's Member-Guest Golf Tournament at Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach County …

“President Stubb and I look forward to strengthening the partnership between the United States and Finland, and that includes the purchase and development of a large number of badly needed Icebreakers for the U.S., delivering Peace and International Security for our Countries, and the World.”
 Asked how he thought Trump would express his impatience with Putin, Stubb said things would be clear in a matter of days. “When you spend seven hours with someone, you at least get an intuition of the direction in which we're going,” he said.

Stubb – in London to see the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer – has emerged as a critical figure in the Ukraine talks process, and, like Starmer, said engagement rather than disengagement with Trump was the best way to persuade America not to abandon Ukraine.

Looking sprightly after his overnight flight to London, the Finnish president said: “I think we're probably moving into the direction where the Americans are seeing Russia for what it's worth. In other words, the overall ceasefire has been agreed by the United States, by Ukraine and by Europe, but not by Russia.

“The half-ceasefire has been broken by Russia, and I think America, and my sense is also the president of the United States, is running out of patience with Russia. I think that's good news for engagement and negotiation. So this is what I sensed over the weekend as well.”
 He explained: “My message in the conversations I have with the [US] president is that we need a ceasefire, and we need a deadline for the ceasefire, and then we need to pay a price for breaking a ceasefire. So number one, we need a ceasefire date, and I would prefer that to be Easter, say, 20 April, when President Trump has been in office for three months. If by then it's not accepted or is broken by Russia, there needs to be consequences. And those consequences should be sanctions, maximum sanctions, and we continue the pressure up until the 20th and then we'll see what happens.”
 He added: “I think it would be quite a useful combination at this moment to get a deadline from the president of the United States with a sanctions package coming from the Senate.”

Stubb said it was not for him to give the US advice on the kind of sanctions it could impose, but Trump said on Sunday, after meeting Stubb, that he was considering secondary sanctions on any country that bought Russian oil.
 Stubb said: “We in Finland understand not to trust Putin. Don't underestimate his capacity to delay. But we need to call his bluff. It's typically Russian to say, ‘yes, Mr President, there's a ceasefire'. And after that, say, ‘but the conditions are …' That's not the way in which I think we should negotiate with the Russians. The only thing they understand is power.”

The Finnish president stressed it would be wrong for Europe to loosen its own sanctions now, as demanded by Putin as the price for a Black Sea peace deal, saying any European sanctions relaxation should be strictly conditions-based.

The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment

after newsletter promotion

He remains a good deal more sceptical than Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff about Putin's bona fides. Witkoff had said it was preposterous to think Russia would want to seize further European land if it was given the four main Ukrainian regions it currently party occupies.

For all the golf diplomacy, Stubb has no compunction in criticising Witkoff, who seemed in a recent interview with Tucker Carlson to regard the referendums held in Russian-held regions and Crimea as a legitimate expression of their wish to be annexed by Russia.

Stubb said: “Anyone who says that a referendum that has been conducted in the Crimean peninsula is somehow valid doesn't know what international relations means. We fundamentally disagree with that approach. I personally will never, ever recognise any territorial acquisition by Russia to Ukraine.”

Stubb has been pressing his fellow leaders to be more specific about what they are seeking to achieve. “A ceasefire is about monitoring the line of contact and can entail some kind of coalition of the willing in the air, sea, and then also in land,” he said.

“But a completely different story is the actual peace agreement. That's when you get into traditional peacekeeping, which is usually UN mandated, and so on and so forth.”
 He explained: “What we are saying in Finland, from the northern flank, having the 1340-kilometre (830-mile) border of Europe with Russia, is that that border actually starts from northern Norway and covers all the way, and if you count Belarus as part of it, that's 5000 kilometres (3107 miles). So that's the border that we need to protect.
 “That's why we are not probably going to provide troops in the ceasefire stage, but we can definitely do something when the peace agreement is there, if there's an international mandate.”
 Either way, Stubb suggests like Starmer, there would have to be some kind of US involvement – something Trump has not yet offered. But, Stubb said: “I don't exclude that some of the monitoring is done by Americans and American technology, because it's non-military activity. So, there's so many ways in which you can do this.”
 Like Graham, Stubb is interested in protecting Ukraine's sovereignty in any peace agreement not by offering Nato membership, but instead through a clear political statement as part of the agreement that Ukraine would be given automatic Nato membership if Russia breached the ceasefire.
 The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, at the weekend proposed a variation by which Ukraine would not be offered Nato membership but instead the protection of Nato's article 5 security guarantee. Stubb said her ideas would be studied closely, but hinted at scepticism, saying article 5 was the essence of Nato. “We think that the core of this war is about the triangular existence of a nation state, which is independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said.

He recalled how Finland lost its sovereignty after the winter war and the war of continuation. “In other words, world war two, we weren't able to decide the clubs where we wanted to participate. We also lost 10% of our territory, including the areas where my grandparents, my father, were born.”

Stubb, who clearly sees Ukraine as an entry-point for a wider, more formal pact with the UK on security, said: “One of the things that I'm particularly pleased about in this tragic war is that we are now seeing a Britain engaged again in Europe. And before coming here, had I had enough time, I would have written a column in the Guardian saying ‘Britain is back'.
 “We are now seeing British and French leadership in brokering the European position, not only here in London, but also in Paris, and in the way in which prime minister Starmer is conducting the discussions his national security team, led by Jonathan Powell. This is a great opportunity for Britain to engage with Europe again and vice versa. So if this could be now the embryo of a new British-EU relationship, I would warmly welcome that.”

Despite his multilingual, academic pro-European background, Stubb is in some ways an ideal conciliator with Trump since he spent three years at university in the US and was at one point considered good enough for the Finnish national golf team –something he modestly admitted was equivalent to being selected for the English ice-hockey team.
 “I did play [golf] seriously. And I played at the British amateur Open at Litchfield sometime in the 1980s. I missed the cut by one,” he ruefully recalled, “and then I went to study in the US with the dream of becoming a professional. But I basically quit after three months and got serious about studying.”
 Stubb said tactfully he would not analyse Trump's golf game for hints of his personality, but said he was “very impressive, and I'm not only speaking because of his age, but he hit the ball very well. It was quite fun in the sense that we were on the same team, so we were playing best ball … we were alternating giving an impact for our teams.”

Stubb said of their game: “It's a good, good, good, good way of spending the better part of seven hours together with the president. So we had breakfast, and then we had a go round the course, and then we had lunch, and we had sitting with Lindsey Graham there, and then we had legendary Gary Player, the South African grand slam winner, at the tender age of 89. It is a good way to get to know one another.”

Golf diplomacy has been seen as the entry ticket to Trump's heart since the former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe successfully courted him in his first term by playing endless rounds. Stubb said it was feasible in golf to mix pleasure with business, so to discuss Russia's trustworthiness “between shots”.
 “Anyway, for sure I prefer a golf course to meeting rooms,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Atlantic editor says Trump adviser's defense for accidentally adding him to war plans chat was implausible

Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg has dismissed the explanation offered by national security adviser Mike Waltz for how he was included in a Trump administration group text chat about – and in advance of – the recent bombing of Houthi rebels in Yemen.

Goldberg said Waltz's theory that his contact was “sucked in” to his phone via “somebody else's contact” was implausible.

“This isn't The Matrix,” Goldberg told NBC's Kristen Welker on Sunday's Meet the Press, referring to the classic science fiction movie about humans unknowingly living in a simulated reality. “Phone numbers don't just get sucked into other phones.

“I don't know what he's talking about there.”

Goldberg continued: “You know, very frequently in journalism, the most obvious explanation is the explanation. My phone number was in his phone because my phone number is in his phone.”

Goldberg made waves when the magazine, over two days beginning 24 March, published details of a group chat that included senior Trump administration officials discussing a then imminent US attack on Houthi installations and senior personnel.

The chat, on the Signal app, unnerved many in Washington about the security precautions being taken by neophyte administration officials to ensure national security, triggering several days of headlines over whether the texts amounted to a breach.

Donald Trump on Sunday repeated his position that the disclosures were a mistake – and the president denied reports that Waltz had offered to resign. “No, he didn't,” Trump said. “There was no reason for him to.”

Earlier, Trump said Waltz is “a very good man, and he will continue to do a good job”.

On Sunday, Goldberg claimed that Waltz is “telling everyone that he's never met me or spoken to me – that's simply not true”. Waltz had said during a meeting with Trump and ambassadors at the White House that he “never met” Goldberg.

“There's a lot of journalists … who have made big names for themselves making up lies about this president,” Waltz said, without offering evidence. Referring to Goldberg, he added: “This one in particular I've never met, don't know, never communicated with, and we are looking into and reviewing how the heck he got into this room.”

The national security council (NSC) confirmed the authenticity of the messages and said it was reviewing how Goldberg got into the Waltz-initiated chat. Theories range from unintentionally selecting Goldberg's number; his number being under the name of a security official supposed to be included; to intentional sabotage.

But Goldberg told NBC News: “This has become a somewhat farcical situation. There's no subterfuge here. My number was in his phone. He mistakenly added me to the group chat. There we go.”

Democratic US senator Mark Warner continued to press the issue on Sunday, saying the Republican White House officials involved in the Signal breach risked American lives.

“If you had been a traditional military officer or a CIA caseworker and you were this sloppy and careless with this classified information, you would be fired,” Warner, of Virginia, told host Martha Raddatz on ABC's This Week. “No doubt about it.”

Warner – a member of the Senate intelligence committee – said he, too, uses Signal because it is safer than texting. “I actually encourage people to use Signal. But that still doesn't mean, because it's safer, you can put classified information” on there, he added.

Congressman Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican and former chairperson of the US House's intelligence committee, told the same outlet that he welcomed a review into what has come to be known as Signalgate and “whether or not these types of conversations should occur”.

Nonetheless, he said he considered the Houthi strikes “a great operation”.

Susan Rice, who served as the national security adviser to former president Barack Obama, told the MeidasTouch podcast that the leak was “extraordinarily reckless” and “unprecedented”.

Rice said even the existence of the conversations is classified.

“This would never be tolerated in a normal administration,” Rice said. “They'd be fired on the spot.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Key elections in Florida, Texas, Arizona and Wisconsin could offer a glimmer of hope to Democrats

Several elections on Tuesday will be a crucial test of the popularity of the chaotic and extremist first two months of Donald Trump's second term and the clout of his close ally, Elon Musk, the world's richest man who has been tasked with radically reforming the US federal government.

They could also offer a glimmer of hope to Democrats – fresh off a surprise upset win in a local race in Pennsylvania last week – that their divided political party could be seeing a resurgence in its fortunes. Or, if they fail to land further blows on Republicans, it will be yet another sign that the party is destined for a long period in the wilderness amid historic lows of its popularity in recent polls.

Many eyes are focused on two previously Republican-held congressional seats in Florida, where its sixth and first congressional districts are vacant and up for grabs. Mike Waltz left to take up a cabinet job for Trump and Matt Gaetz resigned to pursue a failed bid to become attorney general.

House Republicans currently hold a razor-thin majority over Democrats, 218 to 213, with four seats vacant, in the lower chamber of Congress. Republican nerves about how tight the House could become were emphasized last week after Trump pulled the nomination of New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik to be United Nations ambassador – a move widely seen as admitting that marginal Republican districts are at risk of being lost.

It is the old district of Waltz, Trump's embattled national security adviser, that is most at risk. State senator Randy Fine has lagged behind his Democratic opponent, Josh Weil, in fundraising amid concerns that he could lose the district – though such a defeat is far from certain.

Last week Trump held a tele-rally for Fine, speaking to voters over the phone. “Randy will always have a very open door to the Oval Office. He will be there whenever I need him, and he wants to be there whenever we need him. He wants to be there for you,” the president said.

The other district is seen as less of a risk. Florida's chief financial officer Jimmy Patronis is bidding to take over Gaetz's seat, with Trump holding a similar rally for the Republican candidate. “The 1st Congressional District is special, and I won it by a lot, and Jimmy is going to win it by a lot,” Trump said.

Patronis's opponent is Gay Valimont, a gun violence prevention activist.

The two other vacant House seats are in Texas, where Republican governor Greg Abbott appears in no rush to call a special election to replace deceased Democrat Sylvester Turner; and in Arizona, where Democrat Raul Grijalva died two weeks ago.

Democrats were buoyed by last week's unexpected capture of a Republican state senate seat in Pennsylvania. There, candidate James Malone triumphed in the 36th senatorial district, which voted for Trump over Kamala Harris by more than 15 points in last November's presidential election.

“It's only March, and Democrats have defied the odds again with another upset victory in Republican territory,” Heather Williams, president of the Democratic legislative campaign committee, said in a statement after the win.

Meanwhile in Wisconsin, Musk's political influence will be tested on Tuesday in a crucial race for a seat on the state's supreme court, where liberals are defending a 4-3 majority.

The billionaire has been actively backing Republican Brad Schimel, both vocally and financially, funding advertisements against his opponent Susan Crawford and spending an estimated $10m on the race through a political action committee. Schimel also has Trump's backing.

The court's ideological balance is seen as crucial with major cases on abortion, union rights, election law and congressional redistricting already under consideration, or expected to be argued soon.

Crawford, who holds a narrow polling advantage, told supporters this month: “Elon Musk is trying to buy a seat on our supreme court so Brad Schimel can rubber-stamp his extreme agenda.”

Democrats have also spent freely on Wisconsin race, an estimated $32m to Schimel's $41m, including sizable donations from the liberal philanthropist George Soros and the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker.

Nationally, however, Democrats continue to struggle with historically unfavorable ratings since Harris's November defeat, with the party riven by infighting over a perceived failing by leadership to stand up to Trump's extremism.

A CNN poll earlier this month revealed only 29% of respondents, an all-time low in the more than three decades of the survey, viewed the party favorably. Meanwhile, 57% said they wanted Democrats to oppose the Republican agenda rather than working with the majority to pass legislation that included Democratic ideas and priorities.

The poll was taken before 10 Democratic senators, including minority leader Chuck Schumer, joined Republicans to pass a spending bill this month that averted a government shutdown.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

US president says his Russian counterpart's questioning of Volodymyr Zelenskyy's credibility could delay ceasefire

Donald Trump has said he is “pissed off” with Vladimir Putin over his approach to a ceasefire in Ukraine and threatened to levy tariffs on Moscow's oil exports if the Russian leader does not agree to a truce within a month.

The US president indicated he would levy a 25% or 50% tariff that would affect countries buying Russian oil in a telephone interview with NBC News, during which he also threatened to bomb Iran and did not rule out using force in Greenland.

“If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault, which it might not be, but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,” Trump said.

“That would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can't do business in the United States. There will be a 25% tariff on all … on all oil, a 25 to 50-point tariff on all oil.”

The abrupt change of direction came after Putin had tried to attack the legitimacy of Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday, Trump said. Appearing on Russian television, Putin had suggested Ukraine could be placed under a temporary UN-led government to organise fresh elections before negotiating a peace deal.

Trump has previously called the Ukrainian president a dictator, but on Sunday he said: “I was very angry, pissed off” when Putin “started getting into Zelenskyy's credibility, because that's not going in the right location, you understand?”

He said “new leadership means you're not gonna have a deal for a long time, right” and that he wanted to exert pressure on the Kremlin, which has thrown up a string of questions about a peace settlement and only agreed to limited maritime and energy ceasefires so far.

Trump repeated that “if a deal isn't made, and if I think it was Russia's fault, I'm going to put secondary sanctions on Russia”, but then indicated he would quickly back down if there was progress on a ceasefire.

“The anger dissipates quickly” if Putin “does the right thing”, Trump said, adding that he expected to talk to his Russian counterpart this week.

The US president also used the same short interview to tell Iran that if “they don't make a deal” to curb their nuclear weapons programme, “there will be bombing. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before”. Officials from both countries were engaged in negotiations, he added.

He also mentioned fresh economic sanctions as an alternative. “There's a chance that, if they don't make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them,” Trump said. “I am considering putting on secondary tariffs on Iran until such time as a deal is signed.”

Secondary tariffs are a novel idea. The US introduced a 25% tariff last week on countries that buy crude oil and liquid fuels from Venezuela, the largest of which is China, after Trump accused the Latin American country of sending criminals and gang members into the US under the cover of migrants.

Russian oil exports are already subject to a range of sanctions from the US, UK, EU and other G7 countries, leaving China and India as the two largest buyers, according to the International Energy Agency. What is not yet clear is whether the measures proposed would be effective once they come into force.

Finland indicated it may have had a role in Trump's intervention. A day before the interview, Trump spent time with his Finnish counterpart, Alexander Stubb, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The two men had breakfast and lunch and played a round of golf on an unofficial visit, Stubb's office said.

“My message in the conversations I have with the president is that we need a ceasefire, and we need a deadline for the ceasefire, and then we need to pay a price for breaking a ceasefire,” Stubb told the Guardian.

“So, number one, we need a ceasefire date, and I would prefer that to be Easter, say, 20 April, when President Trump has been in office for three months. If by then it's not accepted or is broken by Russia, there needs to be consequences. And those consequences should be sanctions, maximum sanctions, and we continue the pressure up until the 20th and then we'll see what happens.”

During a previous interview with NBC on Saturday, Trump said: “We'll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%” and argued that while there's a “good possibility that we could do it without military force … I don't take anything off the table.”

During the election campaign, Trump had said that he could end the Ukraine war within 24 hours, comments he more recently claimed were “a little bit sarcastic”. That has proved elusive and his tactics to force Russia and Ukraine into agreeing a ceasefire have so far been focused on bullying and pressurising Kyiv.

Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance, berated Zelenskyy at the Oval Office a month ago, which was followed by Washington cutting off intelligence and military aid. Kyiv then signed up to the principle of a 30-day ceasefire if the Kremlin would reciprocate in return for intelligence and aid being restored.

Putin said earlier this month that although he was in favour of a ceasefire, “there are nuances” and any halt in fighting should “remove the root causes of this crisis”, a sweeping but vague demand.

The Russian president and his allies have called for the demilitarisation of Ukraine, insisted that the presence of western troops as peacekeepers would be unacceptable and demanded the full annexation of four regions, three of which it only partially occupies.

Two people were killed and 25 were injured in and around Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, in Russian attacks on Saturday night and Sunday morning. A military hospital was among the buildings struck. Ukraine's general staff denounced what it said was a “deliberate, targeted shelling”, a rare acknowledgement of military casualties.

Trump's intervention follows a difficult week for the White House, during which senior administration officials were criticised for discussing attacks on Houthi rebels in Yemen on the Signal messaging app, which is not authorised by the Pentagon.

The highly sensitive discussion, which included bombing plans, leaked because a journalist from the Atlantic magazine was mistakenly added to the chat by the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

WHCA says it was dropping Amber Ruffin's performance so the event's ‘focus is not on the politics of division'

Comedy is off the menu at the annual White House correspondents' dinner, a once convivial get-together for reporters to meet with federal governments officials that has become too fraught for light-heartedness amid the second Donald Trump presidency.

The dinner, scheduled for 26 April, is organized by the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA), and it typically features a post-meal comedic interlude where a comedian sets to work on the powerful. Beginning with Calvin Coolidge in 1924, every president has attended at least one WHCA dinner – except for Trump.

But this year, the WHCA, already at war with the White House over some news outlets' restricted access to Air Force One and the Oval Office, selected Amber Ruffin, a Nebraska comedian known for mixing her humor with song-and-dance routines – and for frequently criticizing the Trump administration.

The White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich attacked the association for planning to spotlight Ruffin, opening a new front in a conflict between the president and the press that began when the administration said it – not the press association – would now organize the rotating pool of news media members covering the president.

On Saturday, the WHCA announced it was dropping Ruffin's comedic performance so the event's “focus is not on the politics of division” but rather on honoring the work of the group's journalist, according to association president Eugene Daniels.

The decision essentially left the WHCA friendless. Budowich slammed the scrapping of Ruffin's performance, labeling it a “cop out” and calling the entertainer “hate-filled”. He said it was “so sad that such a storied and consequential group has been so quickly driven into irrelevancy”.

But others saw the WHCA's decision as further evidence that the press, at large, has become too willing to bend to the administration's wishes, especially after a series of media company settlements in seemingly winnable defamation cases as well as ongoing efforts by the White House to defund government-backed news outlets, including Voice of America.

Ruffin, an Emmy- and Tony-nominated comedian, began her career as a writer for NBC's Late Night with Seth Meyers, a US talkshow with a stronger political bent than most. She recently joked about a dispute between the White House and the Associated Press over Trump's executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America – a conflict that got the AP booted from the presidential plane and the Oval Office.

“I was like ‘What! Now you care about deadnaming?'” Ruffin said, to laughs, a reference to the hostility that many conservatives aim at people who are transgender.

Trump has a conflicted history with the association dinner. In 2011, then-president Barack Obama turned his comedic spotlight on Trump, who was in the audience, over Trump's preoccupation with Obama's birth certificate. Obama called the would-be president “The Donald” and said he should get back to issues that matter, “like did we fake the moon landing?”

Trump won his first presidency five years later.

The dinner itself has long come under scrutiny, with some questioning if a lavish, jovial get-together between the press and the government, who are highly co-dependent but have opposing interests, should be happening in the first place.

The Hill decided to opt out of the dinner after comedian Michelle Wolf delivered a routine that the outlet's chairperson, James Finkelstein, found “offensive” and “vulgar”.

“There's simply no reason for us to participate in something that casts our profession in a poor light,” he said.

False kinship, elevated hostility, traffic in jobs between media and government, and other aspects of the relationship raise ethical questions for both.

For instance, some have seen the recent scandal surrounding Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg's being added to a group chat on Signal in which Trump cabinet members were discussing plans of a military strike as a journalistic coup. But others have questioned whether a journalist being inadvertently added to such a group – as was the case in Signalgate – could illustrate how close relationships between press and government members can get.

Other matters which thrust the correspondents dinner under review include Trump administration's restrictions on mainstream media access to Defence Department press cubicles as well as the president's habit of asking where reporters work – and ignoring those whose employers displease him.

The Washington Post recently questioned if the conflicts were contributing to a loss of appetite for the top-ticket, meet-and-greet event. A White House press veteran told the outlet that there was a growing sentiment that it should be scrapped.

“It's been a bad idea for a long time. It's even more of a bad idea at this point,” New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker told the outlet. The Times has long opted out of the dinner.

An unnamed White House reporter also told the Post that the dinner has “never has looked great, but now especially, are we really going to be mingling in our tuxes and our ball gowns with members of an administration that is curtailing press access”.

Ron Fournier, a former Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press, told the Post reporters would be better off simply calling sources and filing Freedom of Information Act requests. He said: “Why be around powerful people if the only way they're using their power is to lie to the public and to demean your profession and to undermine the amendment in the constitution that your profession is built around?”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Trump says tariffs on foreign-made cars would would lead to increased sales of US-made cars

Donald Trump said on Saturday he did not warn car industry executives against raising prices as tariffs on foreign-made autos come into force, telling NBC News he “couldn't care less” if they do.

The president's comments came as the White House prepared to impose new tariffs on a range of consumer goods on 2 April, a move that has drawn criticism from international leaders and concerns about potential price increases for consumers.

Among those to express concern on Sunday about Trump's devotion to tariffs was US senator Rand Paul, Trump's fellow Republican.

“International trade since [the second world war] has made us phenomenally rich,” Paul said on The Cats Roundtable on New York's WABC 770 AM. “He says, ‘We've been taken advantage of.' But I really strongly disagree because trade has made us so rich and really has made the world a better place.

“The more we trade … the less we fight.”

In the NBC News interview, Trump said his permanent tariffs on foreign-made automobiles would be a boost to US-domiciled factories and was confident the move would lead to increased sales of American-made cars. “I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars,” Trump said.

Trump, who won a second White House term during November's presidential election part by promising voters that he would lower consumer prices, maintained that he would only consider negotiating on the tariffs “if people are willing to give us something of great value”.

The tariffs are part of Trump's efforts to promote American manufacturing and reduce the country's trade deficit.

Trump's trade policies have been a key focus of his presidency, with ongoing tensions with major trading partners.

On Sunday, a CBS News poll found that 52% of Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy. About 55% of the poll's respondents said Trump's focus on tariffs was “too much”.

GOP lawmakers and consumer advocates have found common ground in banning preservatives and chemicals

A West Virginia law signed this week bans synthetic dyes and preservatives in food – a first-in-the-nation consumer protection led by Republicans in the face of vociferous industry opposition.

West Virginia's law is one of dozens of bills introduced across the country, as Republican state lawmakers get on board with one of the most powerful forces to emerge from the 2024 presidential campaign – the movement to “make America healthy again” or Maha.

The result has been an explosive growth in proposed legislation to ban synthetic dyes, preservatives and chemicals in food packaging – chemicals that consumer advocates have railed against, in some cases, for decades.

“There's a growing bipartisan interest to ban this, and also a bipartisan frustration with how the [Food and Drug Administration] is working,” said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the non-profit group Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI).

“You're seeing more and more states looking into banning these chemicals,” Jose said, adding the tidal wave of new legislation was “unprecedented”. West Virginia's new law owes a debt to California, advocates said, which banned some of the same dyes from school meals in 2024. The Biden administration followed in the waning days of the administration by banning Red Dye No 3.

However, the new law also illustrates a tenuous alliance between science-based consumer advocates, who have historically received sympathy left-of-center, and state Republicans, whose party has a long track record of science denialism.

The figurehead of this movement is Trump's new health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who for nearly a decade was the nation's leading vaccine skeptic – beliefs he has continued to lean into at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The same groups that railed against synthetic dyes came out against Kennedy's nomination – one calling Kennedy a “revenge prank nomination”.

In his short tenure, Kennedy has already underplayed the value of vaccines against measles while promoting potentially harmful alternative remedies, proposed a 10,000-person cut to the department's staff and appears poised to undermine mRNA technology, an intervention that is considered the silver lining of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Trump administration's aggressive cuts led an accomplished government regulator, the FDA's food safety chief, Jim Jones, to resign after “indiscriminate” layoffs made his work impossible.

“The elephant in the room is RFK,” Jose said, referring to Kennedy. “We are worried the administration and Congress are not going to follow the science.”

West Virginia's law will ban Red Dye No 3, Red Dye No 40, Yellow Dye No 5, Yellow Dye No 6, Blue Dye No 1, Blue Dye No 2, Green Dye No 3 and the preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben from school foods beginning this August, and from all foods sold in the state in 2028.

“West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there's no better place to lead the make America healthy again mission,” Patrick Morrisey said, signing the bill on Monday, and thanking Trump and Kennedy.

The law came in the face of fierce opposition, as lobbyists issued apocalyptic predictions about the future of food in West Virginia.

“West Virginia families will face higher food prices and a scarcity of available products in stores because this law effectively outlaws 60% of grocery store food items,” said Kevin Keane, the CEO of American Beverage Association, a lobbying group for non-alcoholic sodas, juices and ready-to-drink teas.

“West Virginians will be left with fewer choices because of what politicians in Charleston decided without any sound science behind them,” said Keane. “Many good jobs will be lost. Businesses will close.”

By contrast, consumer advocates, and now many lawmakers, point to inaction at the federal level as the reason new state-based bans are needed. The heart of their grievance is the Food and Drug Administration's “generally recognized as safe” or GRAS designation, a regulation advocates call a “loophole”.

GRAS was designed by Congress in 1958 to allow food manufacturers to use widely known ingredients without scientific review – Jose uses the examples of beetroot juice, vinegar and salt. But over time, the industry began certifying more and more ingredients through this pathway. In part, that is because the FDA's reviews could be incredibly slow.

Consumer advocates argue Congress has underfunded the agency's food review budget. By contrast, FDA's drug and medical device reviews are funded by user fees from companies that apply for approval – not just Congress. Ingredient review was further weakened by 1997 guidance that did not require food companies to notify the FDA that they had determined an ingredient was safe.

Kennedy announced in March that the administration would review whether to require food companies to notify the department of GRAS determinations.

“The ‘generally recognized as safe' loophole has swallowed the law,” said Scott Faber, senior vice-president of government affairs at Environmental Working Group, a non-profit that has worked to get laws like West Virginia's passed. “Ninety-nine per cent of new chemicals are reviewed by the chemical companies, and guess what? They're always safe,” said Faber. “Perhaps 1% are thoroughly reviewed by the FDA.”

Critics of the GRAS system point to the example of tara flour – a plant-based protein that sickened hundreds of people in 2022 when it was included in meal kit boxes delivered by Daily Harvest. Some customers reported liver and gall bladder problems and even initiated lawsuits.

The FDA only responded two years later, in 2024, when it said the ingredient was not generally recognized as safe and therefore an “unapproved” additive. However, without people getting acutely ill, experts say, ingredients can persist in the food system for years, causing chronic diseases such as cancer.

The extent to which the new alliance between consumer advocates and Republican lawmakers holds remains to be seen. “One of the drawbacks we have when you get more widespread support is you're going to have a more diverse group of people,” said Faber, acknowledging the challenge.

One such salient example was offered by the West Virginia state representative Adam Burkhammer, the Republican lawmaker who introduced the food dye ban, and said he would pursue Maha legislation in future.

“We need to look at everything,” said Burkhammer, before blowing a dog whistle for Republicans' anti-vaccine base: “I think we must continue to look at our processed foods, potable water quality, and even our pharmaceutical and vaccine ingredients,” Burkhammer said.

“We should leave no stone unturned as we truly work to ‘make America healthy again',” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Rare admonition from a sector that has largely been silent in the face of the second Trump administration

The US biotech industry's main lobby group issued a rare warning following the forced and abrupt resignation of the nation's top vaccine official at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), saying the loss of his experienced leadership would “erode scientific standards” and affect the development of transformative therapies to fight disease.

The statement, issued on Saturday by John Crowley of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), followed the news a day earlier that Dr Peter Marks – who led the FDA division that ensured the safety of vaccines – had resigned over what he called “misinformation and lies” from health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.

It was an uncommon admonition from a sector that has largely been silent amid the second Donald Trump presidential administration's first months in office, which have included cuts to medical and scientific research as well as jobs at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

“We are deeply concerned that the loss of experienced leadership at the FDA will erode scientific standards and broadly [affect] the development of new, transformative therapies to fight diseases for the American people,” said the statement from Crowley, BIO's president and chief executive officer. “It is imperative that we retain and recruit scientific expertise and strong leadership at our health agencies and that the high standards that are the hallmark of these health institutions are upheld and advanced.”

Crowley added that his organization – the largest of its kind in the world – was committed to working with the Trump administration “to support and enable a strengthened and modernized FDA”.

Marks had served as the FDA's top vaccine official since 2016, earning global praise during Trump's first presidency for having a hand in Operation Warp Speed, the initiative that developed, manufactured and helped distribute the vaccines protecting the public from Covid-19.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and other media outlets reported Friday that Marks had been faced with a choice to resign or be fired by an official at the Kennedy-led Health and Human Services (HHS) department. Marks chose to resign from the FDA, a key federal agency within the HHS, setting 5 April as his last day at the agency.

The resignation letter that Marks handed in took aim at Kennedy, who has spent years sowing doubt about the efficacy and safety of vaccines that protect communities from preventable diseases.

“It has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,” Marks's resignation letter said. “Undermining confidence in well-established vaccines that have met the high standards for quality, safety and effectiveness that have been in place for decades at FDA is irresponsible, detrimental to public health and a clear danger to our nation's health, safety and security.”

Marks's resignation came three days after the US Senate confirmed Dr Martin Makary – a surgeon at Johns Hopkins University – as the commissioner of the FDA.

Dr Jonathan Howard, a New York neurologist who has closely tracked medical misinformation, has been critical of Makary. Howard has alleged that Makary sought to try to convince people that the world overreacted to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Similarly, in 2021, a group led by Kennedy called for the emergency approval granted to Covid-19 vaccines to be revoked, claiming that their benefits did not outweigh their “risks of serious adverse events or deaths”.

Studies later disproved that claim. A Commonwealth Fund study found that Covid-19 vaccines saved more than 3 million lives in the US and prevented more than 18m hospitalizations through November 2022.

Nonetheless, after promising that he would not change the FDA's vaccine approval process, Kennedy received US Senate approval to serve as Trump's health secretary. Among the senators to support him was Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is a medical physician and frequently speaks about the importance of avoiding deaths and sickness from diseases that can be prevented by vaccines.

Cassidy on Saturday published a statement saying Marks's resignation was “a loss to the FDA”.

“Commissioner Makary and secretary Kennedy should replace him with someone of similar stature and credibility among the scientific community, who will lead without bias,” Cassidy's statement said.

Priyanka Shetty combines personal and political in #Charlottesville, a play that explores the deadly 2017 white supremacist rally

She had moved from India to live the American dream. Priyanka Shetty came to study acting at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, a liberal place of clipped lawns and classical architecture rated in one survey as the happiest city in America.

But what she found was isolation and discomfort because of her race and, as the era of Donald Trump dawned, a nation on the cusp of hostility towards immigrants like her. Then came a white supremacist march through Charlottesville and an explosion of racist violence that left one woman dead.

Shetty combines the personal and political in a one-woman show, #Charlottesville, currently receiving its premiere at the Keegan Theatre in Washington. Based on verbatim interviews with more than a hundred local residents, court transcripts and political speeches, it argues that Charlottesville was a warning from history that went unheeded.

“I don't know why there's this denial about the state of affairs right now in the country,” the 35-year-old said by phone this week. “I don't know how many more wake-up calls we need. I'm not saying this play will be that wake-up call but at least I hope to remind people of something that may seem like old news, which is not really old news. It's very much relevant today.”

When Shetty, from Bangalore in southern India, auditioned for a master of fine arts degree in acting at the University of Virginia in 2015, Barack Obama was still president. “For me America was the place of full of opportunities because to pursue a field like this in India the odds of success are so low,” she said.

“To be in the place where there's Broadway and Hollywood and all of these things to aspire to was a big deal. It was and is still full of promise but at that point I don't think I sensed the danger of being an immigrant or person of colour as much as I do today.”

Charlottesville is a liberal city in a conservative region but Shetty did not always feel welcome. “It's something as simple as, when I'm walking down the streets of Charlottesville, it felt like I wasn't supposed to be there. I had been to other cities in the US and never felt that way.

“But walking down the streets of Charlottesville always felt like the eyes on me, even among mostly undergraduates, with this look of, ‘What are you doing here?' It was liberal in in many ways but I always was hyper aware that I was an outsider or there was this weird feeling under my skin that I shouldn't be there.”

Shetty was out of town when hundreds of white nationalists descended on Charlottesville for a “Unite the Right” rally on 11 and 12 August 2017, ostensibly protesting the planned removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee. They carried torches and marched through the University of Virginia campus chanting “Jews will not replace us!”

Clashes with anti-racism demonstrators broke out both days, prompting authorities to declare the gathering on 12 August an “unlawful assembly” and order crowds to disperse. A man then rammed his car into a peaceful group of counter-protesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring 35.

Shetty recalls: “My immediate impulse was that it was reminiscent of Nazi Germany, especially the kind of slogans that were being chanted and the drama of the open flames. It was scary and my response was to go and read about this movement and who these people were and that led me to the Daily Stormer [a neo-nazi website] and ‘A Normie's Guide to the Alt-Right' [an article on the site setting out the far right's extremist agenda].

“There was a curiosity about it and my mind went to the place that this is a possibility in the United States of America, like it was in Germany back then. It didn't seem that far fetched to me then and it doesn't seem that far fetched to me now.”

Shetty believes the atrocity represented an urgent lesson about a growing faction of far right extremists who believe the white race is superior, women should be sent back home to produce and raise children, immigrants should be deported, Black people should be allocated a different territory or sent back to Africa and homosexuality should be banned.

“America was the place where you could be an immigrant, you could be a woman, you could be a member of the LGBTQ+ community and you could be equal and well respected and successful. But there are a significant number of people who hold an idea of superiority and think certain other people who don't fall into that need to be eliminated.”

The horror of Charlottesville inspired Joe Biden to come out of political retirement and run for president in 2020. On her return to the city, Shetty expected the community to be on high alert and the university in particular to be grappling with the implications.

“What I instead saw was people were ashamed for Charlottesville to be associated with something like this and, for some reason, also didn't want to acknowledge the antisemitic nature of it. As an immigrant, it confused me.

“Charlottesville was that warning which many people think they didn't ignore but we absolutely did because what were the real action items that came out of it? Zero. Then January 6 was another warning that we ignored and here we are in 2025 and we are terrified, with not just the US many other places in the world leaning in these scary directions.”

Shetty felt that American theatre was also failing to respond but, as an outsider, doubted whether she was the right person to confront it. Then she hit upon the idea of interviewing community members to make a verbatim piece in the style of Anna Deavere Smith, renowned for combining journalistic techniques with individual characterisations performance.

Shetty did not have permission from the drama department to do the interviews, so she met the subjects at weekends and quickly ushered them in a lift and then into a basement classroom. She did the interviews on a camera set up for actors to self-tape auditions then transcribed them hand which, though painstaking, helped her capture the cadences and mannerisms of the subjects on stage.

Among all the interviewees, two distinct groups emerged. Shetty said: “There were a bunch of people who were completely flabbergasted that something like this had happened in their town and did not see it coming. There were other people who were like, well, this is how it's been all along.”

With Trump now back in the White House and waging a crackdown against immigrants, civil rights in America are under attack. That includes a series of arrests of international students who are not accused of any crime but have been involved in pro-Palestinian activism on student campuses. Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national and a doctoral student at Tufts University, was sent to detention this week after being snatched off the street outside her home.

Shetty, who now lives in Philadelphia, reflected: “I echo a lot of what the interviewees in #Charlottesville said, that America wasn't great to begin with. But it is sad to see it regress further and further when significant efforts were being made to go in the other direction. Now it feels like we've taken 20, 30, 50 steps back and it's going to take a long time to recover from all of this, if at all.”

Directed by Russian-born Yury Urnov, Shetty plays multiple roles in #Charlottesville including Trump – complete with oversized red tie – and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. Performing at small venue just a mile from the White House, Shetty is aware that she too could become a target but regards art as an essential act of resistance.

“Of course we worry because right now given how people who are green card holders and permanent residents are being targeted it's very easy to pinpoint someone. As an immigrant, I know what it takes to even get here, especially in the arts. I had to prove that I'm an artist of ‘extraordinary ability', which is insanely difficult to do.

“To know that it could be taken away at any moment is scary but at the same time now is not the time to stand down. Sometimes it feels foolish because I feel like, ‘They don't care about their their country, why should I?' But there's something in me that just can't sit idle and do nothing.”

She added: “It may be super foolish to take this on at this time, given how much is at stake for me personally too but I can't help it. I would still like to believe that America is a place where we can question things and criticise something and still be OK. I would still like to believe that.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Trump and congressional Republicans attempting to exert control over mostly Democratic capital city

Washington DC has found itself in the crosshairs of Donald Trump and congressional Republicans in recent weeks, with efforts by both to exert more control over the overwhelmingly Democratic capital city.

The president on Thursday signed an executive order he said would make Washington DC “safe, beautiful, and prosperous” by stepping up crime fighting, arrests of undocumented immigrants and the processing of permits to carry concealed weapons. Trump separately directed JD Vance to “remove improper ideology” from the Smithsonian Institution, which has many museums in and around the city.

Weeks earlier, Republicans in Congress approved a $1bn cut to the city's budget that the mayor, Muriel Bowser, warned would result in disruptive cuts to police, schools and health services. The Senate quickly scrambled to undo the reduction, an effort Trump has since endorsed, but it is unclear when the House of Representatives will act.

“The House should take up the D.C. funding ‘fix' that the Senate has passed, and get it done IMMEDIATELY. We need to clean up our once beautiful Capital City, and make it beautiful again,” the president wrote on Friday.

The forays into the city's politics come despite efforts by Bowser to improve her previously tense relationship with Trump, including by jackhammering the Black Lives Matter plaza installed near the White House. While the public-safety executive order had long been anticipated, the budget cut was a surprise that was enacted as part of a federal government spending bill passed hours before a shutdown would have occurred.

Tazra Mitchell, chief policy and strategy officer at the DC Fiscal Policy Institute thinktank, said a cut of that magnitude to the city's budget would ripple beyond its borders and affect transit and healthcare systems shared with neighboring Maryland and Virginia.

“We're taught as children, if we make a mistake, we own up to it, and we try to do better and right the wrong that we've caused. And what we saw is that the US House had that opportunity and chose not to right the wrong,” Mitchell said.

The legislation, written by House Republicans and making use of Congress's ability to review Washington DC's laws, omits language approving its budget for the 2025 fiscal year. That prevents the city from spending its own locally collected tax revenue and forces a reversion to 2024's spending levels, with likely devastating effects on its municipal services.

“These are local dollars. It doesn't save the federal government any money. We're halfway through our fiscal year, and cutting now would be reckless,” Bowser said at a press conference after the spending bill was approved.

While she did not say when the cut would take effect, the mayor warned that “if we had to make a billion-dollar cut right now … we have to go where the money is in our budget to cut that fast. And our top areas of spending are schools, public safety and the human services.”

It is unclear how the language approving Washington DC's budget was removed from the federal spending bill, but just after it passed the Senate, the Republican Susan Collins described the omission as “a mistake”, and the chamber unanimously passed her legislation to fix it.

In the House, Republican leaders have not said when they will put it up for a vote, and a spokesperson for the speaker, Mike Johnson, did not respond to a request for comment. After Trump weighed in, Punchbowl News reported that the House would likely vote on the measure in early April.

Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House appropriations committee, tried to get language approving the city's budget added back in when her chamber passed the spending bill, but Republicans refused. “Speaker Johnson continues to drag his feet on putting the DC funding fix on the floor of the House of Representatives. This should have never happened,” DeLauro said. “President Trump is right to call on the House to take up the bill that the Senate has already unanimously passed.”

Some allies of the president have encouraged passage of the fix, including the National Fraternal Order of Police, which warned of a “quite severe” public-safety impact if the funding is not restored. The right-leaning American Enterprise Institute called the funding cut “deeply unfortunate”, while Ed Martin, the Trump-appointed interim US attorney for the district, told a neighborhood group this week that he had asked Johnson to bring the fix to the floor.

Some aligned with Trump regard the fix as leverage that should be used over the city. Before Trump weighed in, Andy Harris, chair of the far-right House Freedom caucus, told the Hill the measure's passage should be delayed because his group needs “a little while to come up with a list of what requirements we should put on DC”, and criticized the city for spending “dollars in ways that in the past we thought were pretty foolish”.

Zack Smith, a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, outlined in the Daily Signal a series of policies Congress could impose on Washington DC in the fix, including banning non-citizens from voting in local elections, preventing the city from spending money on undocumented immigrants and giving federal prosecutors the ability to prosecute juvenile offenders as adults.

If House leaders agree, it would be the latest instance of congresses, Democratic and Republican alike, interfering in the affairs of a city that many residents believe should be a state.

“It's not even a budget cut. It's really like a power grab over DC's budget,” said Alex Dodds, co-founder of Free DC, a group that advocates for the city's autonomy. “There's just no way that people in Congress or this president know what we need better than we do.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

At rallies, town halls and protests, voters are unleashing their fury with Donald Trump, stoking what some believe is a populist backlash

Democrats are furious. And they want their leaders to get mad, too.

“I wish you'd be angry,” a constituent told representative Gil Cisneros, a Democrat of California, at a recent town hall. At an event in Minnesota featuring a panel of Democratic attorneys general, an activist voiced a similar sentiment: “Get angry, man,” punctuating the message with a profanity.

The anger roiling the party, slow to build, is now a forceful current coursing through the electorate and pulling in Americans terrified that the country is descending into authoritarianism. Democrats – with no leader to guide them and little power to wield in Washington – are scrambling to harness the sudden fury.

At rallies, town halls and protests, voters are venting their fury with Donald Trump and his empowerment of Elon Musk's full-frontal assault on federal agencies, stoking what progressive activists believe are the embers of a populist backlash against the president – and the Democratic leaders they believe are not meeting the moment.

Tens of thousands of left-leaning voters flocked to “Fight Oligarchy” rallies hosted by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez across three western states last week. Democratic members of Congress spoke to packed crowds at events in House districts held by Republicans, who have been advised not to hold town hall meetings in this climate. And the Arizona senator Mark Kelly joined the Tesla Takedown movement, offloading his electric car after a public spat with Musk.

Despite the rising tide of anger, Democrats still have no clear strategy to confront Trump or the chainsaw-wielding Musk, who said in an interview on Thursday that his mission to slash federal spending by $1tn could be completed within weeks. Their popularity is cratering and they remain divided over policy and messaging.

The deep discontent among Democrats has some wondering whether they are on the verge of their own Tea Party-style, grassroots revolt.

“What if we didn't suck?” Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old progressive TikTok star said in a campaign video launching her bid this week for a safely Democratic Illinois House district that is currently represented by the long-serving representative Jan Schakowsky.

“This isn't a referendum on Schakowsky,” Abughazaleh said in an interview. “We need to try something different and I am sick of waiting around for someone to do something. There is no mythical, perfect candidate that's coming out of the woodwork to save us.”

There is near universal agreement that the party needs a post-election reset. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times​ on Friday, California governor Gavin Newsom, the Democratic leader of the largest blue state, said his party's brand had become “toxic”.

“People don't think we make any damn sense,” he said.

Recent polling reflects the grim state of affairs. Just 40% of Democrats approved of the way their leaders in Congress were handling the job, compared with 49% who disapproved, according to a Quinnipiac University poll last month. The survey, which marked what the university's polling analyst Tim Malloy called a “sobering slap-down of historic proportions for the Democrats in Congress”, was conducted weeks before the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer provided the votes to pass the Republican-drafted government funding bill that ignited a furious backlash and led to calls for new leadership.

A survey released this week by the progressive polling firm Data for Progress showed that 70% of Democratic voters gave the party's response to Trump a “C” grade or below, with 21% assigning a failing grade.

A strong majority of respondents expressed a desire for new leadership in the party, with 69% agreeing that older leaders should retire and pass the torch to the next generation: Democrats with the skill and instinct to compete in a more hostile political – and media – landscape. “What if we came out strong, metaphorical guns a-blazing?” Abughazaleh said.

Anger can be a powerful electoral force, said Steven W Webster, political scientist at Indiana University and the author of American Rage: How Anger Shapes Our Politics.

“An angry voter is a loyal voter,” he said, but there is a risk for Democrats if they fail to match the anger in their base, he said: “They run the risk of having their voters turn on them.”

The progressive group Indivisible is leading a campaign demanding Schumer step aside as leader – though Schumer remains defiant. Leftwing groups are also ramping up efforts to challenge Democratic incumbents in next year's midterm elections.

“The thing that I'm finding, frankly, pretty disconcerting right now is Democrats sticking their heads in the sand and not responding directly to the moment that we're in,” Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible, said on an organizing call this week.

Theda Skocpol, a Harvard sociologist and political scientist who studied the Tea Party, said the conservative movement was the wrong blueprint for Democrats.

“What the Tea Party did to the GOP, it cannot be done to the Democrats, and if it were, it would relegate them to four decades of minority status,” she said. Skocpol, who also studied the anti-Trump resistance that emerged in response to his 2016 election, said her research showed that engagement at the state and local level helped save the Affordable Care Act and turn the tide for Democrats in the 2018 congressional midterm elections. That was a better model, she argued, and it could begin with the upcoming special elections in Wisconsin and Florida on Tuesday.

An upset victory by the Democrat James Malone for a Pennsylvania state senate seat in a district that had voted overwhelmingly for Trump in November provided a beacon of hope for the party. Vincent Hughes, a Democratic state senator, said Malone's victory was a “referendum on the chaos Washington Republicans have brought to our state”, adding: “Voters are fed up.”

Part of the challenge Democrats face is leading a resistive movement without a clear leader.

Asked in an open-ended CNN poll to name the Democratic leader they feel “best reflects the core values” of the party, 10% of the respondents said Ocasio-Cortez, followed by Kamala Harris at 9% and Sanders at 8%, while 30% did not provide a name.

“No one,” one respondent told the pollster, according to CNN. “That's the problem.”

Far lower on the list – or missing entirely – were the Democrats most often cited as potential presidential contenders in 2028: Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, Chris Murphy and Pete Buttigieg.

Sarah Longwell, publisher of The Bulwark and a prominent anti-Trump Republican pollster who addressed House Democrats at their closed-door retreat in Virginia earlier this month, said she left disillusioned by the state of the opposition's leadership.

“Nobody knows what time it is. Nobody seems to be ready to meet this moment,” she told an audience in Phoenix during a live taping of her podcast The Next Level.

Among the few exceptions, ​the conservative host conceded, were Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez ​​because they were actively mobilizing overflow crowds against the Trump administration's mass firings of federal workers, his attempts to dismantle the Department of Education and the threats to overhaul social security and cut Medicaid and Medicare.

​I​f Americans continue​d to show up and speak out​, ​L​ongwell predicted, Trump's popularity would ​eventually fall so low that Republicans would start “figuring out a way to offload him” and Democrats would “stop acting like people who are scared of their shadows”.

As their agitated base searchers for fighters, the party is still searching for answers. There is widespread agreement on the diagnosis: that the party must rebuild trust with the working class and win back the cohorts of young people, Latinos and Asian voters who defected to Trump in 2024.

A post-election analysis by the pollster David Shor found that naturalized citizens swung sharply from Joe Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024, meaning they chose a candidate who promised to close the very same doors they walked through to enter the country. Perhaps most worryingly for the party was their sharp turn toward Trump among young people, especially men.

A growing faction of Democrats favors a populist economic message to recapture these voters.

On Capitol Hill this week, an ideologically mixed group of House Democrats called on their party to embrace a “fighting spirit of patriotic economic populism”.

“Democrats need to wake up and stop defending elites and the establishment,” the representative Chris Deluzio, who represents a competitive Pennsylvania district, said in a floor speech.

“This embrace of economic patriotism might sound and look different depending on where in this country and who the messenger is,” he continued. “But we agree that the era of a spineless Democratic party must end.”

The speech matched the party's fighting mood since Trump's re-election. But the party's identity crisis runs deeper, spanning ideology, policy and messaging.

According to new data from the Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini, nearly 80% of Democrats want the party to take a more combative approach to the president, including 50% who say they want the party to be “much more” combative. It also found Democrats were twice as likely to say they wanted the party to move toward the political center – 42% – rather than to the political left – 20%.

The path forward, according to Ruffini, is what he calls “combative centrism” – candidates who take on Trump and his administration but hold moderate positions on key social and economic issues.

Matt Bennett, a founder of the center-left thinktank Third Way, agrees strongly that the party needs a rebrand, particularly in its approach to working-class voters. But he isn't convinced that a billionaire-centered critique, championed by leftwing populists like Sanders, is the right approach.

“It isn't clear that a country that just elected a billionaire whose best friend is the richest guy on Earth is demanding that we fight the oligarchy,” he said. “They're very mad at both Trump and Elon, not because they're wealthy, but because they're vandals that are destroying the American republic.”

“That does not mean in any way that we are taking a backseat in the fight against Trump,” he added.

One lesson many Democrats drew from their 2024 defeat was that opposing Trump was not enough. But showing a willingness to fight him now might be enough to start a conversation with the voters who ​t​uned them out in November.

“I think there's a lot of opportunity to step in with some fresh leadership and some fresh ideas, and to be bold and on offense,” said Rebecca Cooke, a Democrat who is running for the chance to unseat the Republican representative Derrick Van Orden in a politically competitive Wisconsin House district. “I think we play defense a little bit too much, and I think that it's important for us to be a little bit more uninhibited as Democrats.”

Experts says rounding up protesters and taking control from universities goes beyond McCarthy's witch-hunts

Donald Trump campaigned on the promise that he would crack down against pro-Palestinian student protesters.

Over the past few weeks, he has forcefully followed through.

His administration has directed investigators at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), who would typically target human traffickers and drug smugglers, to track down students who may have shown sympathy for the Palestinian cause in social media posts. His secretary of state has deployed an obscure statute to detain PhD candidates and researchers. Openly flouting bedrock principles of free speech in the US, his administration has thrown the weight of its executive power into crushing political dissent.

First, immigration agents arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia student and permanent resident who led pro-Palestinian protests. The secretary of state personally signed off on his arrest by invoking an obscure provision of the law that allows him to deport foreign nationals deemed to have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States” – a vague formulation that the government has claimed provides it extraordinary leeway to pursue opinions it doesn't like.

Khalil was just the first. This month, immigration officials have made a string of arrests with similarly specious justifications from the government. And it hasn't always been clear why the government has targeted specific students.

Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia student and legal permanent resident, was pursued after she attended a sit-in expressing solidarity with student protesters who were expelled. In a lawsuit filed to block her arrest and deportation, lawyers noted that she never played an organizing or leading role in any of the protest efforts, saying: “She was, rather, one of a large group of college students raising, expressing, and discussing shared concerns.” Yet immigration agents went to great lengths to find and arrest her, seeking help from federal prosecutors to search her dormitory using a warrant that cited a criminal law against “harboring noncitizens”. (To date, they have not managed to detain her, and a judge has asked officials to halt efforts to do so.)

Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old doctoral student at Tufts, was ambushed by agents on the street outside her home and put in a detention center in Louisiana. She, again, was accused of supporting Hamas. But her only known activism, friends and colleagues said, was co-authoring an op-ed in the school newspaper amplifying a student senate vote demanding that the university cut ties with Israel.

Trump is making good on campaign promises. “Any student that protests, I throw them out of the country. You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they're going to behave,” Trump told donors last May.

To aid the government's hunt, far-right, pro-Israel groups such at Betar US have been flagging individual student protesters. The state department has also said it has launched an AI-enabled “catch and revoke” initiative, which will scrape social media to find “foreign nationals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups”.

This isn't the first time the US has taken aim at young people advocating for Palestinians – nearly 40 years ago, immigration officials in Los Angeles arrested eight young immigrants, including two permanent residents, claiming they supported the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which the US designates a terrorist group. At that time, after extensive surveillance and investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that these activists – who came to be known as the “LA eight” – had committed no crimes, let alone terrorism. But the agency urged immigration authorities to deport them anyway, characterizing their protests as “anti-Israel” and “anti-Reagan” – echoing the current administration's rhetoric.

The LA eight fought deportation for two decades, and the US government has not tried to deport people over speech in the same way since – until now.

And there are signs that this is just the beginning.

Weeks before the 2024 election, the ultra-conservative Heritage Project thinktank released “Project Esther”, a 10,000-word blueprint for quashing pro-Palestinian and anti-war protests.

The Trump administration has not confirmed whether it has taken cues from the document, but it has adopted many of its suggestions, including pushing universities to restrict protests and reform their curricula. Last week, under threat of losing hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, Columbia caved to the administration's demands to implement stronger disciplinary measures against pro-Palestinian protesters and take control of one of its academic departments away from faculty. The university agreed to adopt a formal definition of antisemitism that academics and activists say could be weaponised to harass and expel critics of Israel. Even Kenneth Stern, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate at Bard College and the lead drafter of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of antisemitism, said he shares this worry.

Many of the administration's moves are being challenged in the courts, teeing up what is certain to be a high-stakes fight over the first amendment. Judges have so far temporarily blocked the deportation of several students and recent graduates caught up in the administration's scheme.

In the meantime, academics and students have said that the administration's aggressive crackdown has had a chilling effect on academic freedom and free expression.

Ramya Krishnan, of the Knight First Amendment Institute, a non-profit legal organization at Columbia University, and lead attorney on one of the cases against Trump's efforts to deport protesters, compared the current scenario with the McCarthyite anti-communist witch-hunts of the 1950s.

Even then, “you did not see the government rounding up students and faculty for engaging in political protest”, she said. “I really think this is unprecedented.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Validated by Trump, Musk and the manosphere, far-right extremists pull in boys online and use bodybuilding and fight clubs to further their white supremacist agenda

Driving through western Sweden, through pine forests dotted with elk warning signs, Lars Stiernelöf says he has noticed a worrying new trend among young boys. Since the inauguration of Donald Trump in January, after which the US president's top adviser and the world's richest man, Elon Musk, gave two fascist-style salutes, there has been a rise in children using the Nazi salute in schools in Värmland.

“They don't do it as a type of homage to Hitler – they do it because Musk did it,” says the sociologist, who works to counter violent extremism in the county where the Swedish Nazi party was founded 100 years ago. There is, he adds, “a lot of attention around Musk's salute”, which some boys see as “a bit cool”.

While he says that the number of children engaging in this behaviour is small and by no means mainstream, it is evidence of the need for early intervention when it comes to the recruitment of young boys into far-right groups. “It is a ­violent ­message, and it can also be very serious if they're drawn in. It should definitely be taken seriously.”

Far-right extremism has long been present in Sweden, but – as in other parts of Europe and the US – the last few years have seen a dramatic shift in the dominant groups, their structure, activities and recruitment.

The number of active groups in the Swedish far right are at their highest level since 2008, according to a new report by Expo, a Swedish anti-racism institute. After several years in decline, last year saw an increase in the number of groups “attracting a new generation of young men who have lost faith in democracy”. Violence, it reports, plays an increasingly important role – “both rhetorically and in actual acts of violence”.

Sweden's largest neo-Nazi group, the Nordic Resistance Movement (known in Sweden as Nordiska motståndsrörelsen, or NMR), is not the force it once was. Its activities were heavily impacted by being designated a terror group by the US last year, meaning any US-based assets were frozen and it was blocked from the US financial system. It was also affected by changes in leadership and has struggled to recruit younger men within an aging membership.

But in its shadow a multitude of new, smaller, more agile and, to many, more invisible groups have emerged, using racist memes and violent videos to fish for new members on platforms like TikTok before the conversation moves on to other, private platforms.

Among the most successful is Aktivklubb Sverige, which acts as an umbrella organisation in Sweden for five smaller groups across the country, including White Boys Stockholm. The homegrown Gym XIV, which focuses on physical training and preparing for violence, has also played a key role in the development of Sweden's active club movement. Both Aktivklubb and Gym XIV have developed extensive international links across Europe and the US – Aktivklubb is part of the international Active Club network founded in 2020 by the US far-right extremist Robert Rundo.

Stiernelöf, who works for Agera Värmland, a group that helps people to leave violent extremism, says one of the most notable changes is how the age of those being pulled in has plummeted. Some of the boys being recruited, he says, are now as young as 10.

The other notable change is the profile of the types of people who are attracted. “Ten to 15 years ago, it was about the strong, expressive guys who wanted to be seen,” he says. “Today, it is about young, vulnerable guys who often spend their time online and maybe miss social contact. That is a very big difference.”

This change, he adds, is also apparent in the types of “lone actor” males involved in acts of terror and mass violence. In February, a gunman killed 10 people, most of whom had an immigrant background, at an education centre in Örebro before killing himself. While the shooter's motive is not known, he was a “classic lone actor”, says Stiernelöf.

The rise in membership of violent far-right groups is not happening in a vacuum. The far-right Sweden Democrats won the second highest number of seats in the 2022 general election after blaming rising gang crime on immigration. Its leader, Jimmie Åkesson, has also spoken in support of folkutbyte, the far-right “great replacement” conspiracy theory.

Deje is a relatively small community of just a few thousand in Värmland but in recent years it has become a hub of far-right activity. Overlooking a river, among wooden houses painted in traditional colours and above a car workshop, is the Swedish headquarters of the white supremacist Hammerskins. The US Nazi group has been banned in Germany, but in Deje has been met with a “tense acceptance” by the community, says Stiernelöf.

Although its membership is relatively small – estimated at eight to 10 people, mostly men in their 40s and 50s – the venue has become a meeting place for other far-right groups, including NMR, and an international site of pilgrimage for groups including the Proud Boys, which visited last summer.

In the centre of Deje, close to the grocery store and community football pitch used by local children, lies the site of what was until fairly recently a Gym XIV clubhouse. Until it was pulled down by local authorities, it was used for about a year and a half, says Stiernelöf, with a fighting cage visible outside.

Where the group is based now is not known, but it is believed to be relatively close by. These clubs are focused on violence – training for what they claim is a forthcoming race war.

“It is white young men. They talk a lot about the ‘white genocide', ‘white lives matter'. They see a threat to the white man's power,” he says. Role models include figures from the manosphere such as Andrew Tate and Marcus Follin, a Swedish white-nationalist YouTuber known as “the golden one”, whose Instagram feed is full of bodybuilding pictures.

As well as racism, hatred in these far-right groups is also directed at LGBTQ+ people and women.

The home lives of those who are recruited is “very mixed”, he says. But the trademark warning sign for vulnerability is those who are outsiders and do not feel that they belong.

Trump's re-election bolstered the far right in Sweden, says Stiernelöf, even among those who are not open Trump supporters, because there is a sense that “we have a leader in the White House who supports our thing”.

At Expo's office in Stockholm, researcher Jonathan Leman says extreme rightwing groups “feel closer to the mainstream now” – in part because of Trump. “The previous administration saw the worldwide movement of far-right extremism as a threat. ” The Trump administration, he says, “sends the opposite signals” with Musk's public support of far-right groups and “expressing support for extreme-right core ideology”. NMR, he says, has even expressed hope that its US terror designation could be revoked.

In its most recent annual report, Säpo, the Swedish security service, paints a worrying picture of how the overlap of active clubs and online radicalisation could result in increasing violence in the future.

It warned that terrorist groups are using digital platforms and gaming environment to reach younger target groups in order to radicalise and mobilise them at an accelerating pace. “The security service handles cases involving children who have not even reached adolescence,” says the report, with young people “often attracted to violence as an ideology”.

It adds: “In addition to the online problem, active clubs within rightwing extremism are also a growing phenomenon in Europe that primarily attracts younger people.”

Violent extremism, anti-establishment movements and conspiracy theories are overlapping in a way that risks making ideologically motivated violence more common, it warns. “Increased polarisation in Sweden could mean increased acceptance of threats, hatred and violence while creating a breeding ground for violent extremism.”

A former member of far-right groups in Sweden over a 10-year period, who spoke to the Observer on condition of anonymity, became involved before turning 13. He left the movement entirely a few years ago but was initially attracted by the “close community. It was cool”.

The movement has changed dramatically in recent years, he said, from being relatively public-facing to having more secrecy. “Nowadays the movement is very fluid, not so open, but with a lot of outward-facing propaganda online. It is very organised, very tight and tied together. But the outside has much less insight into how it works, how it reacts and who the actors are.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Prime minister says military pressure is working, as he rejects claims that Israel is not serious about negotiations

Rejecting claims from Hamas and Israeli protesters that his government is not engaged in serious negotiations aimed at securing the release of those held captive in Gaza, Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he was committed to reaching an agreement to free the hostages and military pressure had been effective.

“We are willing,” Israel's prime minister told a cabinet meeting. “We are negotiating under fire” and “can see cracks beginning to appear” in what Hamas has demanded in its negotiations, he said.

“Military pressure is working,” he added. “It works because it acts simultaneously. On the one hand, it crushes Hamas's military and governmental capabilities, and on the other hand, it creates the conditions for the release of our hostages.”

Netanyahu said on Saturday night “the security cabinet convened and decided to increase the pressure, which had already increased, in order to further pound Hamas and create the optimal conditions for releasing our hostages”.

Tens of thousands of people who rallied in Tel Aviv and throughout Israel on Saturday night accused the prime minister of deprioritising a deal to free those still held captive in Gaza.

Speaking to protesters at Habima Square in central Tel Aviv, Einav Zangauker, the mother of Matan Zangauker, who is still held captive by Hamas, accused Netanyahu of carrying out a “targeted assassination” against her son after the Israel Defense Forces launched an aerial attack on Gaza last week.

“Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to bomb Matan instead of saving him and bringing him home,” she said.

Of the 251 hostages taken during Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel, 58 remain in Gaza, including 34 who, the Israeli military says, are dead.

Under pressure at international and domestic level, Netanyahu stressed that “Hamas must lay down its arms”, adding that its leaders would be allowed to leave after they did so, and Israel was also willing to talk about “the final stage” of a hostage release-ceasefire deal with the militant group.

“We are ready,” he said. “Hamas will lay down its weapons. Its leaders will be allowed to leave. We will ensure general security in the Gaza Strip and enable the implementation of the Trump plan, the voluntary immigration plan.”

Days after taking office, the US president, Donald Trump, announced a plan that would relocate Gaza's more than 2 million inhabitants to neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, an announcement that was condemned by much of the international community, including allies across Europe and the Middle East.

Netanyahu's remarks came as mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US continued efforts to broker a ceasefire and secure the release of the Israeli hostages.

On Saturday, Hamas allegedly offered to free five living Israeli hostages in exchange for a 50-day ceasefire, and released a video of a hostage making an appeal for his freedom.

Hamas's chief, Khalil al-Hayya, said on Saturday that the militant group expressed willingness to release the five hostages over the Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr, which begins on Sunday, after a proposal it received two days ago from Egypt and Qatar, Reuters has reported.

“Two days ago, we received a proposal from the mediators in Egypt and Qatar. We dealt with it positively and accepted it,” Hayya, who leads the Hamas negotiating team, said in a televised speech. “We hope that the [Israeli] occupation will not undermine [it].”

Hamas stated on Saturday that the group had approved a new ceasefire proposal put forward by mediators, and urged Israel to support it. Netanyahu's office confirmed receipt of the proposal and said Israel had submitted a counterproposal.

The details of the latest mediation efforts remain undisclosed, although, according to media reports in Israel, Netanyahu's government insists on the release of 10 of the 24 hostages.

Meanwhile, Netanyahu's office said he would visit Hungary on 2 April for a multi-day trip in defiance of an arrest warrant from the international criminal court against him for alleged war crimes in Gaza.

The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, publicly extended an invitation to Netanyahu in November shortly after the ICC issued the warrant.

In a separate development on Sunday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said the bodies of 14 rescuers, including a UN employee, had been found in Rafah in southern Gaza, a week after its ambulances came under heavy fire from Israeli forces.

Three PRCS first responders and one civil defence paramedic are still missing.

“The bodies were recovered with difficulty as they were buried in the sand, with some showing signs of decomposition,” the Red Crescent said.

Israel's military admitted on Saturday that it had fired on ambulances in the Gaza Strip after identifying them as “suspicious vehicles”.

The incident occurred in Rafah city's Tel al-Sultan neighbourhood just days into a renewed Israeli offensive in the area close to the Egyptian border. The military resumed its wider bombardments of Gaza on 18 March, breaking a ceasefire that had lasted almost two months.

The PRCS president, Younis al-Khatib, condemned Israel for targeting its paramedics as they were fulfilling their humanitarian mission.

He said a rescue team had been able to reach the scene where the crew members went missing two days ago and had retrieved the body of a crew member, which had been buried.

“There are a number of scenarios for what happened … After more than one week of losing communication with our crew either they have been killed or detained by the Israeli occupation forces,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Uncrewed Spectrum test rocket's failure seconds after blast-off said to have produced extensive data nonetheless

A test rocket intended to kickstart satellite launches from Europe fell to the ground and exploded less than a minute after takeoff from Norway on Sunday, in what the German startup Isar Aerospace had described as an initial test.

The Spectrum started smoking from its sides and crashed back to Earth in a powerful explosion just after its launch from from the Andøya spaceport in the Arctic. Images were broadcast live on YouTube.

The uncrewed rocket was billed as the first attempt at an orbital flight to originate from Europe, where several countries, including Sweden and Britain, have said they want a share of the growing market for commercial space missions.

Orbital rockets are designed to place loads such as satellites into or beyond Earth's orbit.

Isar Aerospace, which had warned the initial launch could end prematurely, said the test produced extensive data that its team could learn from.

The rocket lifted off from the pad at 12.30pm local time (11.30am BST) on Sunday and flew for about half a minute before the flight was terminated, Isar said.
 “This allowed the company to gather a substantial amount of flight data and experience to apply on future missions,” Isar said in a statement. “After the flight was terminated at T+30 seconds, the launch vehicle fell into the sea in a controlled manner.”
 The European Space Agency's director general, Josef Aschbacher, posted on X: “Success to get off the pad, and lots of data already obtained. I am sure @isaraerospace will learn a lot. Rocket launch is hard. Never give up, move forward with even more energy!”

The Spectrum is designed for small- and medium-sized satellites weighing up to one metric tonne, although it did not carry a payload on its maiden voyage from the spaceport in Norway.

The mission was intended to collect data on Isar Aerospace's launch vehicle in a first integrated test of all its systems, the Bavarian company said last week.

The company, headquartered in Munich, had previously said it would consider a 30-second flight a success. While not intended to reach orbit on its first mission, the test marked the first commercial orbital flight from a launchpad on the European continent, excluding Russia.

European countries have long relied on paying for launches from Russian space stations but the relationship has broken down since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

US companies, notably SpaceX, Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are emerging as big players in a budding industry to send satellites, such as broadband internet or observation equipment, into space for governments and private businesses. Chinese companies are also seeking to capitalise on the new sector.

Many estimates suggest the global space industry could generate revenues of more than $1tn (£770bn) within the next two decades.

Isar Aerospace intends Spectrum to be able to launch up to 1,000kg into low-Earth orbit, an area of space up to about 1,200 miles high where most satellites shoot around the globe. Founded in 2018, the startup developed its rocket almost entirely in-house.

Before the test flight, Aschbacher had said: “Whatever the outcome, Isar Aerospace's upcoming Spectrum launch will be historic: the first commercial orbital launch from mainland Europe. The support and co-funding the European Space Agency has given Isar Aerospace and other launch service provider startups is paying off for increased autonomy in Europe.”

Last year, a report by Mario Draghi, a former European Central Bank president and former prime minister of Italy, recommended Europe could boost its economic growth by recognising space as a key sector. Independent access to space is also increasingly seen as a geopolitical and security issue.

Europe's space industry has experienced delays in the development of the Ariane 6 rocket and the suspension of the European Vega-C satellite launcher after an accident.

In addition to Isar Aerospace, Europe is home to Germany's HyImpulse and Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA), the French groups Latitude and MaiaSpace, and Spain's PLD Space.

Several destinations around Europe have been marked for spaceport projects, including the British Shetland Islands, the Portuguese Azores, and Esrange in Sweden. Coastal areas near stretches of open water are considered ideal spots for launch sites, as rockets do not have to fly over heavily populated land areas.

Britain has had mixed success as a launch destination. Virgin Orbit, the satellite launch company founded by Richard Branson, filed for bankruptcy in 2023 after its inaugural flight from Cornwall – with a rocket strapped to a Boeing 747 – ended in failure.

Isar Aerospace has signed a contract with the Norwegian space agency to put two maritime surveillance satellites into orbit by 2028.

Far-right leader could be barred from standing for presidency if she is convicted over alleged fake jobs scam

The future of the far-right leader Marine Le Pen – and France's political landscape – will be decided on Monday when a court hands down its verdict on charges she and party officials embezzled money from the European parliament.

If convicted, the three-time presidential candidate of the National Rally (RN) could be barred from standing to succeed Emmanuel Macron in the 2027 presidential election.

Public prosecutors have demanded Le Pen be given a €300,000 (£250,000) fine, a prison sentence and that she be prevented from holding or seeking to hold a political position or five years.

On Friday, in a case that did not involve Le Pen, France's constitutional council delivered a blow to the RN figurehead when it ruled that politicians can be barred from office immediately if convicted of a crime.

Le Pen has accused prosecutors of seeking her “political death” and said making her ineligible for office would confound voters' wishes and threaten the democratic process.

A poll in Le Figaro earlier this month suggested 42% of French people wanted her to stand in 2027. Le Pen appointed Jordan Bardella, 29, as RN president in 2021 but a senior party member said there was “no plan B” if Le Pen was ruled immediately ineligible to stand in 2027, and accused the party of sticking its head in the sand.

Marc de Fleurian, the RN MP for Pas-de-Calais, said: “The question of ineligibility doesn't arise. It's not taboo, but as long as we've said that such injustice cannot happen, it won't.”

Le Pen and 24 others from RN, including party officials, employees, MEPs and assistants, were tried last November on charges of taking money from the European parliament as part of an alleged fake jobs scam. Instead of the money being spent on EU staff, they were accused of having used it to pay party staff in France. The European parliament estimated the allegedly embezzled funds amounted to about €7m. Le Pen and the others have denied the charges.

Any verdict that does not clear Le Pen of wrongdoing will leave her political future in grave doubt. If she is found guilty of embezzlement she will almost certainly appeal, which will require a new trial to be held, and any prison sentence or fine will be postponed until the appeal hearing is judged. If she is given a five-year bar on standing for public office with immediate effect it will be unlikely she can enter the 2027 presidential race unless the appeal process is speeded up and she is cleared in time to stand. If the judges decide the bar on standing should be postponed, she will still have what one RN member described as a “Damoclean sword” hanging over her political campaign.

Asked last week if she was concerned for her political future, Le Pen said: “I'm not thinking about it. Fear doesn't remove the danger so I don't see any interest in guessing in advance. I consider myself completely innocent of what I have been accused, so if my guilt is declared then I will use the law to again defend my innocence.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

After a $220m five-year renovation, the New York museum is set to showcase a trove of European masterpieces 

Can masterpieces of European art help smooth over the fissures between the old world and the new? It's a hope, say officials at the Frick Collection in New York, which reopens next month after a five-year, $220m (£170m) renovation.

Axel Rüger, the director of the museum, which began with a trove of European masterpieces including Rembrandt and Vermeer, hopes that its art could be a reminder of US-European ties in these turbulent political times.

“We are approaching a time when culture and education are not seen as priorities,” said Xavier Salomon, the Frick's deputy director, at a preview of the renovated museum last week. “It's a huge mistake, in my opinion, and I hope a place like this gives people a chance to think about the role of culture in our lives.”

The Frick, which started with the collection of Henry Clay Frick, the Robber Baron-era industrialist, has long been an oasis from the intensity of the city – a home in a grand style but domestic in overall feel. Now it could be something more – a reminder that European culture and leadership was once held in high esteem by the ringmasters of US power.

Reluctance by European travellers to visit the US has yet to show in official figures, as it has for Canadian visitors, but Eric Dresin, the secretary general of the European Travel Agents' and Tour Operators' Associations, told the New York Times last week that “turbulent times” are anticipated.

The museum's old-world charm, updated by architect Annabelle Selldorf, now comes with additional galleries on an upper floor. It includes Ingres's portrait of the Comtesse d'Haussonville and George Romney's 1785 painting Lady Hamilton as “Nature”, as well as François Boucher's wall panels of frolicking children.

“The whole collection, ultimately, comes from Europe,” said Rüger, newly installed as director of the Frick after serving as the secretary of the Royal Academy of Arts in London and the curator of Dutch painting at the National Gallery in London.

Rüger notes that Frick, a Mennonite from Pennsylvania who made his fortune in steel, “first gravitated to English art and the aesthetic of the English country houses. It was not as intentional as it sounds now, but Americans looked to their ancestors, and a lot came from Europe.”

The museum reopens as reciprocal tariffs, while not specifically targeting art, loom over a market already depressed by high interest rates, inflation, geopolitical instability and a shift in tastes. Global dealers are this weekend in Hong Kong, at Art Basel, hoping to lure Chinese and Asian buyers back into the market dominated by US sales.

At the same time, the Trump administration is threatening to gut the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which provides funding for museums and libraries across the US. Keith Sonderling, acting director of the agency, said he plans to steer it toward promoting “American exceptionalism” and cultivating “love of country”.

Last Thursday Trump issued an executive order – “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History” – promising to eliminate “divisive narratives” from the Smithsonian Institution's museums and National Zoo, and restore “monuments, memorials, statues, markers” that have been removed over the past five years. A fact sheet describing the order said it will focus on removing “anti-American ideology”.

In June the Frick will unveil Vermeer's Love Letters – the Frick's Mistress and Maid and two loans, The Love Letter from the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, and Woman Writing a Letter, with Her Maid from the National Gallery of Ireland.

Salomon said no one is sure the ladies are writing or receiving love letters, per se, but the themes of letter writing and epistolary exchange in 17th century domestic settings are intact nonetheless. “They may be shopping lists, who knows?”

“Art from the past is always relevant, and as history changes around these works they assume a different significance,” Salomon said, pointing to Rembrandt's The Polish Rider, in the Frick collection, which acquired the title long after it was painted. It became a symbol of Polish freedom fighting and more recently, on loan to Poland, a symbol of support of Ukraine's resistance to Russia.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Alaa Abu Zeid only discovered his wife and children had been killed after his release from an Israeli prison. His is a story repeated across Gaza

 ‘They don't want them to know anything': Gaza civilians held in Israel not told families had been killed

More than a year after his abduction by Israeli soldiers, the first thing Alaa Abu Zeid wanted to do on his return to Gaza was hold his wife and children. He didn't know that Ali, his brother, would be the only person waiting when he arrived in Khan Younis earlier this month: Alaa's wife, Hala, and all five of the couple's children had been killed in an Israeli airstrike last summer.

Abu Zeid, 48, the headteacher of a primary school funded by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Bureij in central Gaza, was arrested along with dozens of other men when Israeli troops raided the school turned shelter in December 2023. He would never see his family again.

“We had no idea where he was the entire time, we were so afraid for his safety,” said Ali, speaking on Alaa's behalf, as the UN employee is not authorised to speak to media.

“Waiting for him was very difficult. We were happy but it was mixed with deep sorrow. I didn't know how to tell him his wife and children had been killed.”

Abu Zeid's family – Hala, 49, a teacher; Nour, 25, an engineer; Alaa, 22, a dentistry student; Riyad, 20, a science student; Walaa, 15, and Mohammed, 13 – were killed in an airstrike on their house in Bureij overnight on 20 August, eight months after he was abducted.

Ali and his sons tried to rescue their loved ones from the rubble, but there were no survivors: just ripped-up body parts. When morning broke, they recovered more remains and, as is Muslim tradition, buried them the same day.

This horrific story is repeated all over the Gaza Strip, where according to the local health ministry, 1,400 families have been entirely wiped out by Israeli bombing, numbers deemed accurate by UN agencies. The arrival of the ceasefire and hostage detainee swaps in January has brought joy as abducted Palestinians return home to Gaza, but also the painful process of returning home to search for missing loved ones, and grappling with the scale of the territory's collective loss.

“He insisted we take him immediately to the graves,” Ali said. “He was very quiet, he didn't cry. I think he was in shock.”

Abu Zeid was released on 15 February as part of the fragile ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that paused 15 months of fighting. He maintains he had nothing to do with Hamas; like thousands of other civilian men from Gaza, he appears to have been caught up in the huge Israel Defence Forces (IDF) dragnet.

Emergency legislation introduced after the Palestinian militant group's attack on Israel in October 2023 that ignited the war allows for the detention of Palestinians from the territory without charge or trial, classing them as “unlawful combatants”. The IDF says the measure complies with international law.

A Guardian investigation last year documented extreme and systemic mistreatment of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons since the conflict broke out – findings corroborated by Abu Zeid's experience in detention. At least 60 people have died in Israeli custody since October 2023. The headteacher said he was severely beaten on several occasions and his eyesight is now impaired, necessitating surgery. The prison in the Negev desert was overcrowded and often freezing, and prisoners were not allowed to seek medical treatment or wash, leading to outbreaks of scabies and other skin problems.

Abu Zeid was given just enough food to stay alive: he lost 25kg in weight and his gaunt appearance upon release shocked his surviving family.

“He looked like a skeleton. At every moment in detention, he said he felt like he was staring death in the face,” Ali said.

The Israel Prison Service has previously told the Guardian that it operates according to the law, and under the oversight of the state comptroller.

Abu Zeid had no access to legal representation or news during his imprisonment. On his return, he knew immediately something was deeply wrong when Hala and the children were not waiting to greet him. Ali was forced to confirm his brother's deepest fears.

He is recovering from his ordeal at Ali's damaged home in Bureij, and says he will return to teaching when fit enough. He has changed, Ali says: he is quiet and finds it hard to talk to people. He has grown closer to God, spending time reading the Qur'an. With his home destroyed, there are no pictures of his killed loved ones to look at.

“He imagined holding [his family] in his arms again, his children, and returning to live a decent life,” Ali said. “Instead, he found a catastrophe.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Police go door-to-door arresting Afghans as government pledges to send millions back home to Taliban rule

More than 50 prominent female Afghan women's rights activists sheltering in Pakistan are facing deportation home, where they fear they will be imprisoned or killed under Taliban rule.

Under a draconian policy, the Pakistan government has pledged to deport millions of Afghan nationals, after relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan severely deteriorated and attacks by militants in the border areas surged.

Pakistan government ministers have accused Afghans of being “terrorists” and “traitors” who are fuelling crime and militancy in the country.

Pakistan began deportations of Afghan refugees in September 2023. According to a recent report by Amnesty International, so far at least 844,499 Afghan nationals have been forcibly deported back to Afghanistan where they are at “real risk of persecution by the Taliban”.

Among those facing the threat of returning to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan are 60 female activists and human rights defenders, who fled persecution after they spoke out for women's rights and education or attended protests. Many have been forced into hiding in recent weeks, as police have been going door-to-door in the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, arbitrarily arresting any Afghans and allegedly demanding huge bribes.

Humaira Alim worked as a women's rights and education activist in Afghanistan for seven years before the Taliban came back to power in 2021. After women were deprived of the right to work and then attend university under the group's strict Islamic rule, she was among a group of women who defied the Taliban and helped organise protests on the streets.

But after facing “dire warnings” and then direct threats to her life from the Taliban for her activism when pregnant with her first child, Alim said she had “no choice” but to flee over the border to Pakistan in December 2022.

She has stayed in Islamabad ever since, living with her two young children on a visa that has been given monthly. Alim described her situation as an “awful nightmare”, as all Afghan nationals – even those who had lived in Pakistan for decades – were now facing routine persecution and harassment from the police. She and her children were recently forced to hide on the roof of their home as officers came looking for them.

“If they send me back to Afghanistan, it only means death,” she said. “The Taliban have records on me and my activism. There is no place for women like me. They only arrest and torture us. I can't go back there with my children.”

Alim said she knew dozens of other Afghan women like her, who had worked as activists, lawyers and human rights defenders and faced harassment or torture at the hands of the Taliban, who were now in hiding in Pakistan.

Liliana Harrington, senior campaigner for Avaaz, an organisation that has been advocating for the women, said: “Deporting these people to the Taliban is a death sentence. Pakistan would not only abandon these brave people to their oppressors but also abandon its proud legacy of protecting vulnerable Afghans.”

The Pakistan government has given all undocumented Afghan nationals a deadline of 31 March to leave the country, otherwise they will be arrested. Alim said she and other female activists were just asking for more time, to find a third country who might be able to offer them asylum. Currently, they are waiting to see if they get an offer from Brazil or if other countries will offer them a safe haven.

The widespread expulsion drew condemnation from Isabelle Lassee, Amnesty's deputy regional director for south Asia. “The Pakistani authorities are violating the rights of Afghan refugees with impunity, subjecting them to arbitrary decisions that are shrouded in secrecy, totally lacking transparency and accountability,” she said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Lincoln blockaded southern cotton, McKinley hit Britain with tariffs and Nixon abandoned the gold standard: a quick history of transatlantic economic meddling

After the American civil war began in 1861, President Abraham Lincoln tried to hamstring the economy of the southern states by blockading cotton exports. Yet that cotton was mostly sent to northwest England, and when supplies dried up in 1862, around 60% of cotton mills of Lancashire stopped production, causing huge hardship, job losses and hunger – and a riot in Stalybridge.

Although some flew Confederate flags in Liverpool and Manchester, Lancashire workers agreed not to use cotton picked by slaves. Lincoln sent aid ships the following year, and UK textile manufacturers developed more efficient processes.

By the end of the war in 1865, both trade and Lancashire's industries had recovered.

Donald Trump's hero, President William McKinley, believed strongly that US industry needed protection after two decades of recessions and rising protectionism in Europe, so he introduced a wide range of protectionist measures with the Dingley Tariff Act in 1897.

Ties between the UK and US accounted for 7% of global trade, so with some of McKinley's tariffs reaching 57%, British industries such as tinplate and alkali manufacturing paid a heavy price. Yet the effects of the tariffs were masked by the strength of the UK economy and an empire-first strategy in which UK exports were given preferential treatment in Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.

McKinley changed his mind during his second term – in 1901 he came out in support of trade treaties, only to be assassinated the next day.

After the Wall Street crash in 1929, the US Congress reacted by introducing stiff tariffs in the belief that it would make the US self-sustaining. Since the tariffs, promoted by Republican Willis C Hawley were mostly directed at Europe, counter-tariffs were swiftly levied by European nations. Trade ground to a halt.

Britain and France had amassed huge debts from US loans during the first world war, and the effect of the trade war was to usher in the Great Depression of the 1930s and the rise of fascism.

After the second world war, the international economic order was established at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, with the dollar backed by the price of gold, and other currencies pegged to the dollar. By the 1960s, things started to unravel.

The cost of the Vietnam war, rising inflation and unemployment and the possibility of a run on the dollar led President Richard Nixon to unilaterally abandon the gold standard. The UK was swept along in the decade of instability that followed – which included the recession in 1973, the oil crisis, soaring inflation and the three-day week implemented by Ted Heath after miners went on strike.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Police launch probe into a man suspected of accidentally starting the country's worst wildfires in history while clearing his relatives' gravesites

South Korean police have launched a probe into a man suspected of accidentally igniting the country's worst wildfires in history while cleaning his grandparents' gravesites, an investigator has said.

More than a dozen fires have been fanned by high winds and dry conditions, killing 30 people and burning more than 48,000 hectares (118,610 acres) of forest, with officials calling it the worst of its kind recorded in South Korea, with the fires exposing the harsh reality of global heating.

In North Gyeongsang province's Uiseong – the hardest-hit region with 12,800 hectares of its woodland affected – a 56-year-old man was suspected of mistakenly starting a fire while tending to his grandparents' gravesites on 22 March, an official from the provincial police said.

“We booked him without detention for investigation on Saturday on suspicions of inadvertently starting the wildfires,” the official, who declined to be named, told AFP on Sunday.

Investigators will summon him for questioning once the on-site inspection is complete, which could take more than a month, the official said.

The suspect's daughter reportedly told investigators that her father tried to burn tree branches that were hanging over the graves with a cigarette lighter.

The flames were “carried by the wind and ended up sparking a wildfire,” the daughter was quoted as saying to the authorities, Yonhap news agency reported.

The police, who have withheld the identities of both, declined to confirm the account to AFP.

The fires have been fuelled by strong winds and ultra-dry conditions, with the area experiencing below-average rainfall for months, following South Korea's hottest year on record in 2024.

Among the 30 dead is a helicopter pilot, who died when his aircraft crashed in a mountainous area.

The blaze also destroyed several historic sites, including the Gounsa temple complex in Uiseong, which is believed to have been originally built in the seventh century.

The inferno has also laid bare South Korea's demographic crisis and regional disparities, as rural areas are both underpopulated and disproportionately elderly.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Joakim Medin, who works for the Dagens ETC newspaper, was arrested on Thursday when his plane landed 

A Swedish journalist who was detained on his arrival in Turkey to cover protests over the jailing of Istanbul's mayor has been arrested on terror-related charges and for “insulting the president”, the Turkish presidency has said.

Joakim Medin, who works for the Dagens ETC newspaper, “has been arrested on charges of ‘membership in an armed terrorist organisation' and ‘insulting the president'”, the presidency said on Sunday.

Medin was detained on Thursday when his plane landed in Turkey, and sent to prison the next day.

In a bulletin published by its “disinformation combat centre”, the presidency said Medin was “known for anti-Turkey news and his closeness to the terrorist organisation PKK”, the banned Kurdish militant group.

“This arrest decision has no connection whatsoever to journalistic activities,” it added.

His newspaper's editor-in-chief, Andreas Gustavsson, described the accusations as “absurd”, telling Agence France-Presse that “practising journalism should not be a crime”.

The Swedish foreign minister, Maria Malmer Stenergard, told public radio his case was an “absolute priority” and vowed to raise it with her Turkish counterpart.

The jailing of Medin came just hours after the authorities released the last of 11 journalists arrested in dawn raids on Monday for covering the protests, including the AFP photographer Yasin Akgül. He was released on Thursday.

Turkish authorities also deported the BBC journalist Mark Lowen, who had been covering the protests, after holding him for 17 hours on Wednesday, saying he posed “a threat to public order”, the broadcaster said.

Turkey's communications directorate said Lowen had been deported “due to a lack of accreditation”.

Turkish prosecutors opened an investigation into Medin in 2023 over a protest he joined in Stockholm in which a puppet of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was hung by its feet, according to the presidency's statement on Sunday. It said the Swedish journalist was among 15 suspects believed to have carried out, organised or publicised the demonstration.

The protest infuriated Turkish authorities, who alleged it was orchestrated by PKK members and summoned Sweden's ambassador to Ankara.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Popular student demonstrator Berkay Gezgin, 21, snatched off street by police outside office of detained Istanbul mayor

When 21-year-old Berkay Gezgin left the interior of Istanbul city hall, a squad of police was waiting for him outside. Protests that flooded the streets outside the headquarters of his political hero, detained mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, had begun trickling away by midnight, but hundreds of riot police remained clustered around the municipality building.

Gezgin became the face of youth support for İmamoğlu when he met him on the campaign trail during his first run for mayor in 2019, coining the slogan “Everything will be fine”, which the Istanbul mayor later used in his campaign.

As Gegzin left city hall and looked for his parked motorcycle, the young student was snatched by waiting security forces and bundled into a police car.

His lawyer, Cemil Çiçek, believes the police targeted him for arrest: “They knew who they were arresting and that he has a lot of youth support. We think he was jailed to send a message to people not to protest, not to go into the street, [to say]: if this guy can be jailed, so can you. Two hundred other people were detained on the same day, so maybe now parents will warn their kids against protesting.”

The baby-faced student became one of almost 2,000 people detained in just one week as the Turkish authorities clamped down hard on the largest anti-government protests to sweep the country in years.

A longtime rival of Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, İmamoğlu was accused of corruption, removed from office by the interior ministry and sent to the infamous high-security Silivri prison on the edge of Istanbul. This happened on the same day his party officially declared him a presidential nominee.

Erdoğan has frequently lashed out at the protests, calling them “a movement of violence”, and accusing his main political opponent, the Republican People's party (CHP), of “shielding those who attack police with stones and axes”, pointing to more than 120 police officers injured during demonstrations.

“Courts held those accountable who committed treason against the national will, and will do so in the future,” he said. “The judiciary will hold those behind any sabotage against the Turkish economy and the wellbeing of the nation accountable.”

A week after the mayor was detained, Istanbul's prisons were full, and those rounded up at protests are now being transferred to facilities outside the city, the opposition alleges.

Gezgin was taken to a nearby police station along with dozens of others. “They kept him and more than 50 people in detention for four days in that police station. They were not told the charges against them,” said Çiçek.

“As a lawyer, I never saw anything like this before in my life. All of them held in that jail are students and none of them are guilty of anything. Their only crime was protesting, attending a completely legal gathering. This is not a crime under our constitution.”

The recent wave of arrests targeted protesters, journalists who covered the demonstrations, municipal workers and even Imamoğlu's lawyer. Last week, members of a teaching union were put under house arrest pending trial after they stopped work in solidarity with protesting students.

Ten photojournalists were detained in pre-dawn raids on their homes, with most of them jailed on charges of breaking laws governing protest. They were released some days later, only for two other journalists to be detained the following day.

BBC correspondent Mark Lowen was arrested at his hotel, held for 17 hours and deported back to London after covering the demonstrations. Turkey's presidential communications directorate said his deportation was due to his lack of press credentials.

The crackdown on protesters grew alongside increasing scenes of police violence against demonstrators. Human Rights Watch described how officers struck protesters with batons and kicked them as they lay on the ground, while security forces “indiscriminately used pepper spray, teargas, plastic bullets and water cannon against protesters, causing numerous injuries”.

Turkish authorities also took steps to ensure such scenes were not visible to the wider public. Ankara's media watchdog, RTÜK, served one opposition channel with a 10-day broadcasting ban, while other networks that showed live footage of the demonstrations were fined and told to stop airing some programmes.

The country's justice minister, Yılmaz Tunç, defended the investigation into İmamoğlu at a press conference earlier last week, saying: “We don't want any politician to be arrested, but if there is a suspicion, then the judiciary decides.”

He added: “These are serious accusations,” pointing to the large numbers of suspects. “In this situation, where someone is suspected of committing a crime, to eliminate this suspicion the efforts should be in front of the judiciary and not in the streets.”

As Tunç spoke to journalists from a grand Ottoman-era palace, Gezgin was shivering inside a prisonless than an hour away. A day earlier, he had appeared in court, his dark curls framing his clearly shaken expression as he received a brief hug from Ali Mahir Başarır, deputy chair of the CHP group in parliament, who called him “the hope of millions”.

“You are taking revenge on that young man – you can't judge hope!” he posted on social media The following day, he posted a video of another mass rally outside Istanbul city hall, quoting Gezgin: “Everything will be fine.”

Gezgin has been accused of “insulting the president” and “resisting the police”. Çiçek pointed out that the 21-year-old was not at the demonstrations, as he was inside the municipality building at the time, and that a notorious incident where a crowd of protesters cursed Erdoğan's family members occurred two days after his detention.

In a grim twist of fate, the lawyer now believes that Gezgin will also be sent to Silivri prison, facing the possibility of months in pre-trial detention.

“He loves İmamoğlu and he'll meet him in jail,” he said. “He is young, but very brave.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Sophie Chandauka claims there is ‘significant correlation' with drop in funders and prince's move to the US

Donors abandoned the charity Prince Harry founded in memory of his late mother when he left the UK, the chair of Sentebale has said amid a bitter media row in which she accused the prince of trying to “eject” her through “bullying” and “harassment”.

Sophie Chandauka told Sky News's Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme that there was a “significant correlation” between a drop in funders and the Duke of Sussex's departure to the US after the controversy caused by his rift with the royal family.

It was “pretty obvious” the charity, which supports people with HIV and Aids in Lesotho and Botswana, had lost corporate sponsors and individual donors around that time but there was “no discussion” about it, she said, adding that trustees had told her it was “uncomfortable” with Prince Harry in the room.

Chandauka, a Zimbabwean lawyer, told the programme: “So when I arrived in July in 2023, of course the first thing you do is you open the annual report, you look at the board minutes to see what is going on in the organisation.

“I did a seven-year historical review of the financials, looking at our costs and looking at our revenue, so income, it was pretty obvious to me that we had lost quite a number of corporate sponsors.

“We'd lost some families, and we'd lost individuals who were donating to the organisation, and there was quite a significant correlation between the time the organisation started to see a departure of sort of major organisations, and Prince Harry's departure from the UK itself.

“When you look at the board minutes, though, there is no discussion about what's happening with respect to some of our most significant funders and then when you discuss with the senior executive team and ask why there isn't a conversation about this – the answer is: ‘It's really difficult to have this conversation because the instruction was, it's an uncomfortable conversation to have with Prince Harry in the room.'”

She said: “Really, what Prince Harry wanted to do was to eject me from the organisation and this went on for months.

“It went on for months through bullying, harassment. I have documentation. There were board meetings where members of the executive team and external strategic advisers were sending me messages saying: ‘Should I interrupt? Should I stop this? Oh my gosh, this is so bad.'

“In fact, our strategic adviser for fundraising then sent me a message saying she wouldn't want to ever attend any more board meetings or bring her colleagues because of the treatment.

The interview, trailed on Saturday and aired in full on Sunday morning, included allegations of “harassment and bullying at scale” from the prince towards the chair, after Harry and several others quit the organisation earlier this week.

Though Harry has not commented specifically on the bullying and harassment allegations, sources close to the prince said the claims were “completely baseless”.

A source close to the charity's trustees and patrons who stood down last week said they “fully expected this publicity stunt” – meaning Chandauka's comments – and reached their collective decision to quit with this in mind. They added they “remain firm in their resignation, for the good of the charity, and look forward to the adjudication of the truth”.

Two named former trustees have come out in support of the prince, with Kelello Lerotholi, who resigned from the charity this week, telling Sky News he did not recognise the allegations: “I can honestly say, in the meetings I was present in, there was never even a hint of such.”

Chandauka said the prince, who she said had not been to Africa for five years, had made moves against her, adding further trustees to the charity's board in efforts to bolster his control. In a separate interview with the Financial Times, she said there was noticeable friction between the UK staff and those based in Lesotho, where most of the charity's 500-plus workforce is based. She said the board felt “a loss of power and control and influence … ‘Oh my goodness, the Africans are taking over.'”

When Harry could not have her removed through a vote, because of a legal challenge, she alleges, he aimed to sabotage the charity, which he set up in 2006 in memory of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.

Chandauka, who appeared on Sky News with another board member, the investment banker Iain Rawlinson, claimed the rift became public with the prince's “unleashing of the Sussex machine” against her.

The Conservative peer Lynda Chalker, who served as a trustee for nearly two decades until November, described Chandauka as having an “almost dictatorial” style.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Ukrainian officials denounce ‘deliberate' targeted shelling of hospital; Ukrainian president says US, Europe must respond to daily Russian drone attacks. What we know on day 1,131

Russian drones struck a military hospital, shopping centre, apartment blocks and other targets in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, late on Saturday, killing two people and injuring at least 25, local officials and the Ukrainian military said. On the Telegram messaging app, the military's general staff said those injured included servicemen undergoing treatment in the medical centre. It accused Russia of having carried out a “war crime” and of “violating the norms of international humanitarian law” denouncing the “deliberate, targeted shelling” of the facility. Oleh Syniehubov, the regional governor, said 25 people were hurt, including a 15-year-old girl who is in serious condition.

An hour before the Kharkiv attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine expected a strong response from western countries to the near daily Russian drone attacks on its territory. Earlier, drones hit the south-eastern city of Dnipro, killing four people, and the central city of Kryvyi Rih, where nine others were injured. “We expect a response, a serious response. We are working to ensure there is a strong reaction, especially from America, Europe and all those in the world who rely on diplomacy,” said Zelenskyy. He said that Russia's response to US ceasefire efforts had been inadequate “for too long”, and that Moscow needed to be pressured into a peace deal.

Zelenskyyalso said Russia had launched more than 170 drones into Ukraine overnight, striking targets in the Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, and Khmelnytskyi regions. He said that Ukraine was “maintaining active measures” to prevent Russia from advancing into Sumy and Kharkiv regions, and that that Ukrainian forces had taken “certain steps” in Russia outside the Kursk region to ease pressure on Ukrainian troops in the area.

Russia on Saturday claimed the capture of two villages in eastern and southern Ukraine, pressing ahead with its advance amid stumbling efforts for a ceasefire. The defence ministry said Moscow's forces captured the village of Shchebraki in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and Panteleimonivka in the eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces also captured the settlement of Veselivka in Ukraine's northeastern Sumy region, Russian state-run news agency Tass reported on Saturday, citing the Russian defence ministry. Reuters was not able to independently verify the report.

Russia's defence ministry on Saturday accused Ukraine of attacking Russian energy facilities in the past 24 hours despite a moratorium on striking each other's energy infrastructure. The ministry said Ukraine attacked power grids in the Belgorod region several times leaving about 9,000 residents without power supply. Reuters could not immediately confirm the account. Both sides this week claimed there were fresh violations as the land war continued unabated.

Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in the coming weeks to maximize the pressure on Ukraine and strengthen the Kremlin's negotiating position in ceasefire talks, according to Ukrainian government and military analysts who spoke to The Associated Press. The Ukrainian officials said the move could give Vladimir Putin every reason to delay discussions about pausing the fighting in favour of seeking more land. Ukrainian leaders have argued repeatedly that Russia has no intention of engaging in meaningful dialogue to end the war. “They're dragging out the talks and trying to get the US stuck in endless and pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions' just to buy time and then try to grab more land,” Zelenskyy said on Thursday in a visit to Paris. Two G7 diplomatic officials in Kyiv agreed with that assessment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A nurse, a civil servant and a teacher, among thousands of Palestinians detained without charges, were not informed their relatives had died in Israeli attacks

 ‘He insisted we take him to the graves': the Palestinian civilians coming home to catastrophe

For six months after it became impossible, Ahmed Wael Dababish still dreamed of a simple reunion: the day he could once again hug his wife, Asma, his two daughters and his young son.

A nurse from Gaza, Dababish last saw his family in the early hours of one night in December 2023, when Israeli troops attacked a school where they had sought shelter.

Soldiers ordered men into the courtyard, then detained many of them, including Dababish. He was held incommunicado for 13 months without charge, trial, access to a lawyer, or any communication with his family. So when an Israeli shell killed Asma, 29, and their youngest daughter, three-year-old Ghina, in August 2024, there was no way to send news to him.

He was released in February under the ceasefire deal after turning 33 in prison, and was briefly overwhelmed when he saw his father and cousins waiting to welcome him home.

“It was amazing to see someone I knew,” he said. The joy at being surrounded by familiar, beloved faces, after a year of hunger, torture and isolation from everyone he knew, lasted until he asked about his wife and children.

Dababish's father called up a photo on his phone to help break the unbearable news. It showed Ghina, his baby, laid out for burial beside her young cousin. “This is the moment I still cannot believe,” Dababish said, breaking down again at the memory. “It never crossed my mind that they could be killed.”

As he sobbed, his two surviving children, six-year-old Muadh and eight-year-old Aisha, tried to comfort him with hugs.

His tragedy is not unique. The Observer spoke to three Palestinians from Gaza whose immediate family were killed while they were held by the Israeli military or in Israeli civilian prisons without charge or trial. They only learned about their losses when they were released months later.

The three men are civilians – a nurse, a civil servant and a headteacher of a primary school – who say they have never taken up arms. They had no access to a lawyer in jail and were not allowed to communicate with their families.

Legal rights groups say there are likely to be many other detainees from Gaza who have lost close family in Israeli attacks, but have not been told of their deaths.

Family visits, letters or calls have been banned for Palestinians held by Israel since 7 October 2023, when Hamas launched its surprise attack on Israel, and televisions and radios have been removed from cells.

“They are enforcing this isolation on prisoners. They do not want them to know anything about their families and their loved ones,” said Tala Nasir of the Palestinian prisoners' rights organisation Addameer.

Prisoners who are able to secure legal representation can sometimes get news from their lawyers, but there are certainly hundreds and probably thousands of detainees from Gaza who do not have a lawyer.

Most are held under Israel's unlawful combatants law, which allows indefinite detention without producing evidence. The state can hold someone for 45 days before allowing access to a lawyer or bringing them in front of a judge to authorise the detention. At the start of the war, those periods were extended to 180 and 75 days respectively.

Amnesty International said the system “legalises incommunicado detention, enables enforced disappearance and must be repealed”. Despite thousands of detentions, there have been no known trials of anyone captured in Gaza since 7 October 2023.

There is no government provision of lawyers to Palestinian detainees and it is impossible for legal aid groups to support prisoners on the scale now needed, said Jessica Montell, executive director of HaMoked, an Israeli group with decades of experience fighting for Palestinian rights through the Israeli courts.

“I'm sure it is the case that the vast majority of Gaza detainees have not seen a lawyer,” said Montell, adding that HaMoked's teams have visited a few dozen detainees from Gaza, out of thousands held inside Israel. “There's nothing like a public defender's office that is going to meet with all of them. There is no obligation on the state to provide lawyers.”

Bureaucratic obstacles and the remoteness of many detention camps and prisons further limit visits. When lawyers do manage to meet detainees from Gaza, breaking painful news is a regular part of their discussions, according to Nasir.

“Many of the prisoners we were following had one or two of their family members killed in Gaza and they did not know at all. It's so heartbreaking, and it's really hard for the lawyer to tell this information to the prisoner.”

In December, the Israeli state said it was holding more than 3,400 Palestinians from Gaza under the unlawful combatants law, in response to a high court petition from campaign group the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI).

At least 1,000 people detained in Gaza after 7 October 2023 were released under the ceasefire agreement that broke down this month, but thousands are still in jail. Tal Steiner, director of PCATI, said Israeli prisons were holding about 1,500 detainees from Gaza and that “it would be reasonable to estimate that several hundred [Palestinian] detainees are still being held in military camps.”

The Israeli military declined to say how many Palestinians from Gaza it holds, or how many have met lawyers, but said it did not limit the content of legal meetings held with prisoners or what documents lawyers could bring to them. “Many detainees have already exercised their right to meet with a lawyer,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. “Israel rejects claims that there is a policy of isolating Palestinian detainees from the outside world.”

The Israeli military, the statement added, respected national and international law in its treatment of detainees and rejected all allegations concerning systemic abuse.

Civil servant Ibrahim Dawood is among those freed during the ceasefire. He said he never had access to a lawyer and was physically attacked when he asked for a chance to prove his innocence.

“My friends taught me some words in Hebrew, how to ask the soldiers politely for a meeting with the officer, asking only for justice. They would beat me on the way there and back,” he said. “I kept telling them that they should listen to me and not accuse me of things I didn't do.” He spent 13 months in prison in the Negev desert, arriving there badly injured after an Israeli attack on the school where he was sheltering with his family.

Ill health, hunger and the beatings weighed on him, but just as bad was the mental pain of being separated from his family, he said. “I didn't know anything about their fate and knew they had no information about what was happening to me.”

The relief of release, when it came, was very fleeting. He found out that the family home in al-Fakhura, near Jabaliya, had been destroyed in an Israeli airstrike that killed his father, sister, his sister-in-law and her three children. The moment when he heard the news – and collapsed in grief – was captured on video and widely shared on social media.

“The people who should have welcomed me home had been taken from me by the [Israeli] army. On top of the pain of injury and captivity came the pain of losing beloved relatives who I will never see again.”

His surviving family is fragmented between the north and south, and he cannot find space to bring his wife, children and widowed mother together under one roof.

The Israel Prison Service (IPS), which runs civilian jails, said “all prisoners are detained according to the law”. Asked about the abuse and isolation described by Dababish and Dawood, a spokesperson said: “We are not aware of the claims you described and as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility.”

Dababish said he also never saw a lawyer and that Israeli officials had accused him of being a Hamas member because he was a nurse in a state-run hospital. Hamas has governed Gaza for nearly two decades. “I responded that I was a displaced person with my wife and children in an evacuation school, in an area the army had designated as safe.”

The lack of contact with the outside world, or any due process, violates the Geneva conventions, rights groups say. Dababish said it added to the agonies of detention, deepening prisoners' despair.

“It felt like we were living in a grave. You couldn't know anything about what was happening outside, where your family was, what was going on.”

His home was bombed, so he is living with his parents and two surviving children in a school turned shelter – which sparks painful memories of the night he was detained – and has little sense of security.

All his family's worst tragedies have played out in similarly repurposed schools – meant to be places of relative safety for civilians fleeing Israel's war on Hamas. His wife and daughter were killed in another school, when a shell hit a classroom in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City. “They were displaced in an evacuation shelter. They did nothing wrong,” he said.

Haunted by loss and memories of detention, he is trying to keep going for his children.

Dmitry Krymov, who fled Moscow after the Ukraine invasion, plans Dickens hybrid with UK and Russian actors

The acclaimed Russian stage director Dmitry Krymov the winner of many of Moscow's top theatre prizes before his exile due to public criticism of the invasion of Ukraine, has spoken angrily of the impact of the war ahead of his first work with British actors. The Moscow-born director, 70, plans to use Dickens's two stories Great Expectations and Hard Times to create a new performance.

Arriving in London this weekend for a short stay, Krymov, who is regarded by many western theatre pundits as among the best directors in the world, told the Observer he wants to link British and Russian performers and audiences, despite the divisions caused by President Vladimir Putin.

“It is because of this that we wanted to create our Dickens show,” he said, before the first of his acting workshops. The rehearsals have been set up by Margaret Cox, the writer and producer who is also the daughter of the Scottish Succession star Brian Cox, in collaboration with one of Krymov's former students, Lucie Dawkins of Scrum Theatre in Hammersmith. “My brother, the actor Alan Cox, and I have long admired Krymov, so we have been supporting him in any way we can,” said Cox.

Krymov hopes to create more of the kind of cultural exchanges that have recently been blocked both by sanctions and bad feeling towards Russia. His anger and sorrow at leaving Moscow, where he was a key cultural figure, are now a driving force behind his work, he said, although he recognises the pitfalls of using entertainment to send out a political message. “It's a process. Expressing your pain in artistic form is not easy at all; you just want to shout out what you think in direct, unprintable text,” he said.

His period of exile, which began when he signed a letter of protest in 2022, the day after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has given him new energy, he suspects. “As the saying goes: ‘What doesn't kill us makes us stronger'. So, I hope to prove with my activity now that we are in this unexpected crack in the earth's crust, that not everything is subject to the laws of physics. In other words, I try not to fall into the abyss, but stage performances on the crack's edge.”

That February day three years ago, Krymov had flown to the US with his wife, Inna, ready to carry on work on a production of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard in Philadelphia. But on landing, friends and concerned colleagues back in Moscow warned him it would now be too dangerous to return to Russia.

In an interview with the broadcaster Voice of America, Krymov compared the threat of the invasion to that posed by the second world war. Immediately, seven of the nine different shows he had running in theatres across Moscow were shut down. His name was removed from the posters of the remaining two; they have now also been closed.

Until that point Krymov had been both critically admired and popular in Russia, famously using experimental techniques and winning many Golden Masks, the equivalent of an Olivier award or a Tony award on Broadway. He is also the child of well-known parents; a director, Anatoly Efros, born in territory now inside Ukraine, and a critic, Natalya Krymova.

Krymov, who took his mother's name, had already been critical of Putin, signing an open protest letter after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but he had been left to work relatively unchecked.

As an exile, he travelled first to Latvia, France and Israel, before settling in New York and setting up an actors' workshop there. He has since argued against strict cultural boycotts, which he sees as potentially counterproductive. “The desire to destroy everything Russian on a national basis is also nationalism,” he has said.

During his stay in London this week, Krymov will answer questions after a screening of his show Все тут, or “Everyone Is Here” – based on Our Town, a classic of American theatre by Thornton Wilder – at Ciné Lumière South Kensington.

This weekend he said he was looking forward to gaining an understanding of British talent, adding that all actors who move from a film set to the stage of a theatre are moving “from Disneyland to an empty space”.

He had, he added, no clear idea of London's theatrical style yet, although he has seen the difference between Broadway and off-Broadway shows. “In the Russian tradition, people come to the theatre in search of answers to questions that concern them, while on Broadway, people come to have a good time.”

In Russia, he said, he hoped that, despite the war, “the basic need to hear something important, something not written in the newspapers or said out loud, will still remain.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Watchdog accepted Taiwo Owatemi's claim for landlord's surcharge to let her keep dog in London flat

Ministers will ask the Commons authorities to consider changing rules that allowed a Labour whip to claim £900 in expenses to rent a pet-friendly flat in London.

The government will lobby the independent expenses regulator to look at allowance rules after Taiwo Owatemi claimed for a pet surcharge demanded by her landlord to allow her to keep her dog in the property.

The MP for Coventry North West made her claim last summer, and it was accepted by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa). But Dan Jarvis, the security minister, said on Sunday he would not have made such a claim, and criticised the rules that allowed his Labour colleague to do so.

Jarvis told LBC: “I wouldn't do that; [I] haven't done that. Therefore, I think it can't be right that the rules allow any member of parliament to do that.

“That is why the government will be making representations to Ipsa, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, to ask them to look very carefully at the detail of this particular rule.”

He added: “It's important to say that the MP in question hasn't done anything wrong in that she's followed the rules as they are at the moment. But we don't think that those rules can be right and that's why the government will flag it with Ipsa.”

Owatemi has been contacted for comment.

The MP, who has a cockapoo called Bella, made her expense claim last August for her rented property in south-east London, where she pays £2,340 a month in rent. Ipsa listed the £900 surcharge as a claim for “pet rent”.

Parliamentary rules allow MPs who represent constituencies outside London to claim for the rent on a property in the capital to allow them to attend late-night votes and do other Commons work during the week.

Owatemi has previously posted about her love of animals, including a post to mark National Pet Day with a photograph of her and Bella together. She wrote: “Today we celebrate the joy our pets bring to our lives.”

Hannah Campbell, a disability rights campaigner, told the Sun on Sunday: “When disability money is being cut, to hear that an MP has received £900 for a dog really is shocking.”

MPs are to vote in May on the government's plans to cut disability support payments for hundreds of thousands of people over the next four years.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

British artist, 87, who was visited by the king in his London home, said he did not know him well enough to paint him

Renowned artist David Hockney has said he did not offer to paint King Charles when the monarch visited his London home on Monday because he doesn't know him well enough.

This is not the first time that Hockney has shied away from painting royalty. The 87-year-old also refused a number of offers to paint the late Queen Elizabeth II because he only paints people he knows.

Speaking in an interview with the Times, before his latest art show, Hockney said of the king's visit to his Marylebone home: “He came on Monday for about an hour. But I didn't offer to paint him.”

Of Elizabeth II he said: “It's difficult to do the majesty … I thought, she is a genuinely majestic figure, and I just couldn't see a way to do it.”

The Bradford-born artist said in the interview that his pictures were better if he knew the subject “really well”, and he criticised Lucian Freud's portrait of the late Queen. He said: “When you look at the queen, her skin is absolutely marvellous. It's very beautiful skin. Well, he didn't get that at all.”

In the interview, Hockney explained that he had moved back to London from his former home in Normandy, France in 2023 because of “intrusion”, as “people kept coming round”.

The 87-year-old painter's latest show, called David Hockney 25, will open in Paris at the Fondation Louis Vuitton art museum and cultural centre.

Hockney talked about the new paintings he had produced from his Marylebone home. One of his efforts, which he calls Play Within a Play Within a Play and Me with a Cigarette, is a pro-smoking message. “I'm nearly 88 years old and I didn't think I'd be here. I'm still a smoker, but I'm surviving,” he said.

“I read in the newspaper the other day that lung cancer was going up and smoking was going down. Well, what did that tell me? It told me that it wasn't really smoking.”

The outspoken artist also remarked on his perceived rise of officiousness: “People are getting very … bossy. There's an awful lot of bossy people about now. They're little Hitlers, aren't they? And there's lots of them. Bossy bossy boots.”

Hockney, who began working in the early 1950s, is best known for A Bigger Splash (1967), Portrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures) (1972), and Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy (1971).

Even though Hockney did not paint the late Queen, he did make a stained glass window for her named the Queen's Window, which was unveiled in Westminster Abbey in 2018.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Welby ‘profoundly ashamed' of comments he made after resigning as archbishop of Canterbury over scandal

The former archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said he forgives a serial abuser at the centre of the scandal that led to his resignation as leader of the Church of England and spoke of feeling “profoundly ashamed” of comments he made afterwards.

In his first interview since resigning in November, he also said he had “not really thought it through enough, to be honest” when he initially declined to quit last year.

Welby became the first head of the Church of England to resign over scandal after an independent review found he should have taken speedier and more robustaction over allegations of abuse by John Smyth.

About 130 boys are believed to have been victims of Smyth, a powerful lawyer who died in 2018.

Asked if he would forgive Smyth, Welby said in an interview broadcast on Sunday with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg: “Yes. I think if he was alive and I saw him, but it's not me he's abused.

“He's abused the victims and survivors. So whether I forgive or not is, to a large extent, irrelevant.”

Reacting to Welby's comments, a survivor of Smyth's abuse told Kuenssberg: “I came forward 13 years ago and what the church has put me through makes the historic abuse pale into insignificance. It has been the most extraordinary traumatic journey trying to get answers. I don't care about Smyth.”

The independent review by Keith Makin – in which he highlighted significant failings and proposed recommendations to improve safeguarding practices in the church – concluded that Smyth could have been brought to justice had the archbishop formally reported allegations to the police a decade ago.

Welby initially said he would not resign over the report and remained in post for a further five days before announcing he would quit, plunging the C of E into crisis.

In the BBC interview he said: “What changed my mind was having been caught by the report being leaked and not really thought it through enough, to be honest.

“Over that weekend, as I read it and reread it and as I reflected on the horrible suffering of the survivors, which had been, as many of them said, more than doubled by the institutional church's failure to respond adequately, it increasingly became clear to me that I needed to resign.”

Welby also said he winces at the thought of his final speech in the House of Lords, in which he had referenced a 14th-century beheading, to laughter from fellow peers, and suggested “if you pity anyone, pity my poor diary secretary” who had seen weeks and months of work “disappear in a puff of a resignation announcement”. It prompted anger from abuse victims and others.

The former archbishop said he “wasn't in a good space at the time” and should not have made the speech at all. “It did cause profound upset and I am profoundly ashamed of that, and I apologised within 24 hours and I remain deeply ashamed,” he said.

Welby also used the interview to say his failure to take effective action over a serial sadistic abuser was because he had been overwhelmed by the scale of the abuse crisis in the church

“Every day more cases were coming across the desk that had been in the past, hadn't been dealt with adequately, and this was just, it was another case. It was an absolutely overwhelming few weeks.”

The survivor of Smyth's abuse who gave his reaction to Kuenssberg questioned why it had not been a priority for Welby. “You may be swamped by other cases, but if this one wasn't fairly close to the top of the pile, then what was?” he asked.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

More than 200 demonstrations take place from Australia to Switzerland; senior FDA official resigns citing RFK Jr's ‘misinformation and lies' – key US politics stories from 29 March 2025

People around the world joined protests against Elon Musk and his attempts to dismantle the US federal government on Saturday, gathering outside Tesla showrooms from Australia to Switzerland and California.

Protest organizers asked people to do three things: don't buy a Tesla, sell off Tesla stock and join the “Tesla Takedown” movement. “Hurting Tesla is stopping Musk,” reads one of the group's taglines. “Stopping Musk will help save lives and our democracy.”

Musk, the world's richest person, heads Donald Trump's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), which he's tasked with slashing federal budgets in the US, including laying off tens of thousands of workers.

With more than 200 events planned worldwide, protests kicked off midday in front of Tesla showrooms in Australia and New Zealand and then rippled across Europe in countries including Finland, Norway, Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the UK.

Each rally was locally organized with original themes. In Ireland, it was “Smash the Fash”, and Switzerland had “Down with Doge”.

Woman pulled to safety after 30 hours trapped in building a rare glimmer of hope in midst of devastation

 ‘No one came': Myanmar volunteers dig with bare hands to save earthquake victims

Rescue workers battled for a second night to find survivors of Myanmar's devastating earthquake, which has killed at least 1,644 people and injured thousands more.

Teams with little protective equipment, at times using only their bare hands, scrambled to free survivors from the rubble of countless buildings that were shattered by Friday's 7.7-magnitude earthquake.

There was a brief moment of joy for exhausted emergency workers as a 30-year-old woman was rescued alive after more than 30 hours trapped beneath an apartment building in Mandalay, Myanmar's second-biggest city and one of the worst affected areas.

Phyu Lay Khaing, who was brought out of the Sky Villa Condominium, a 12-storey development, by stretcher, was embraced by her husband, Ye Aung, and taken to hospital, AFP reported. It is feared more than 90 people remain trapped there.

In neighbouring Thailand Bangkok's governor, Chadchart Sittipunt, said the search for construction workers at the site of a collapsed 30-storey building in the capital would continue. “We believe that there are still survivors. We will do everything possible to rescue them,” he said on Saturday evening, adding that heavy machines, including cranes and diggers, were being used to clear access at the site. The building fell to the floor while under construction near the city's Chatuchak weekend market.
 Drones and sniffer dogs have been deployed to identify signs of life. At least 10 people have died in Bangkok. Dozens more are missing.

Myanmar's ruling junta said in a statement that 1,644 people have now been found dead and another 3,408 injured. Others are still missing.

Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing issued a rare appeal for international help on Friday, and declared a state of emergency across six areas of the country. Aid began to arrive in Myanmar on Saturday with Russia and China, two of the isolated junta's few allies, flying in rescue teams and supplies. India sent a search and rescue team and a medical team, and Malaysia said it would send 50 people on Sunday.

The response to the disaster is complicated not only by communication outages and damaged roads, but also the conflict that has gripped the country since the military seized power in a coup in 2021. The junta has faced dogged armed resistance to its rule, formed of a patchwork of groups, including civilians who took up arms to fight for the return of democracy, and ethnic armed organisations that have long fought for independence. It has lost swathes of territory, and responded with relentless airstrikes, which continued even after the devastating quake, including in Sagaing, close to the epicentre.

The World Food Programme's country director, Michael Dunford, said that coordinating a response to the disaster would be “very challenging”. He added it could be “days and weeks” before the true scale of the damage in Myanmar is known. An assessment by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said hospitals and health facilities had sustained “extensive damaged or destruction”, adding that there were “a severe shortage of medical supplies”.

Major bridges, roads, universities, hotels, historical and religious sites and public buildings have also been heavily damaged or destroyed, according to reports cited by UNOCHA.

The shallow 7.7-magnitude quake, which was followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock, was felt across the region, and is the largest quake to hit Myanmar in decades.

Myanmar's junta chief invited “any country, any organisation” to help with relief and said he “opened all ways for foreign aid”.

The junta has in the past repeatedly been accused of blocking humanitarian aid to areas controlled by its opponents. The Norwegian Refugee Council said “immediate and unhindered access for aid workers” would be critical.

On Saturday evening many in Mandalay prepared to sleep outside overnight, either because their homes had collapsed or they feared continued quakes.

The disaster comes at a time when many aid agencies are scaling back their work following Trump's cuts to the US Agency for International Development, a major donor. Trump said on Friday that the US was going to help with the response, though no concrete commitment has yet been announced.

The UK will send a package of up to £10m to support people in Myanmar, the Foreign Office said.

The European Union said it was providing €2.5m (£2.1m) in initial emergency aid and assessing the needs on the ground to mobilise further assistance. EU crisis management commissioner Hadja Lahbib said the EU “stands in solidarity with people in Myanmar and the broader region”.
  The United Nations has allocated $5m (£3.9m) to start relief efforts, while the World Health Organization said it was preparing to surge support in response to “a very, very big threat to life and health”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Red Cross says devastation is of a level not seen in Asia for over a century as more than 1,700 people killed

Rescue volunteers, many of them poorly equipped local people, raced to find survivors in the rubble of collapsed buildings across central Myanmar, two days after a huge earthquake killed more than 1,700 people in the country and at least 18 in neighbouring Thailand.

Red Cross officials said Myanmar was facing “a level of devastation that hasn't been seen over a century in Asia”, after a 7.7-magnitude quake struck near the centre of the country on Friday afternoon, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.

The quake has damaged and destroyed countless buildings including hospitals, damaged roads and bridges, and brought down power supplies, phone and internet connections.

“People who need help are continually calling us, but even now there are difficulties for them to reach us,” said a rescue worker in Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city.

Ko Doe, a rescue worker in Sagaing, said his team believed as many as 100 bodies were still to be removed from collapsed buildings in the town. “A bad smell is coming from the bodies that remain trapped, and which we are unable to save immediately. We need backhoes, cranes, and heavy-duty diggers to demolish the damaged buildings and retrieve the bodies,” he said.

In Thailand, rescue efforts continued at the site of a collapsed 30-storey tower in the Chatuchak district of Bangkok, which fell to the floor while under construction, trapping dozens of workers. Officials from Bangkok metropolitan administration said signs of life had been detected in one area of the site early on Sunday morning. Eleven people have been confirmed dead and workers are frantically searching for 78 who remain missing.

Myanmar's ruling junta said in a statement on Saturday that at least 1,700 people were killed and more than 3,400 injured in the country, with at least 300 more missing.

The true scale of the devastation in Myanmar, which has been gripped by conflict for the past four years, could take days or even weeks to emerge, according to aid experts.

The US Geological Service's predictive modelling estimated Myanmar's death toll could top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country's annual economic output.

On Sunday morning, a small aftershock struck, sending people scurrying out of a hotel for safety, after a similar tremor felt late Saturday evening, AFP reported.

Truckloads of firefighters gathered at one of Mandalay's main fire stations to be dispatched to sites around the city.

China and Russia, two allies of the junta, have sent aid and personnel, while India, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore have also sent assistance.

The US pledged $2m (£1.5m) in aid “through Myanmar-based humanitarian assistance organisations” and said in a statement that an emergency response team from USAID, which is undergoing massive cuts under the Trump administration, was deploying to Myanmar. 

It follows a rare request by Myanmar's isolated junta for international help. The junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, said on Sunday he called on “all military and civilian hospitals, as well as healthcare workers” to “work together in a coordinated and efficient manner”, according to state-run media.

The earthquakes have compounded the crisis in Myanmar, which was plunged into war when the military seized power in a coup in 2021.

It is facing an armed opposition formed of people's defence forces, which emerged to oppose the coup, and more established ethnic armed groups, that have long demanded independence.

The shadow national unity government, set up to oppose the junta, said anti-coup groups had declared a two-week partial ceasefire in quake-affected regions starting on Sunday. The military continued airstrikes following the quake, including just hours afterwards.

The national unity government said it would “collaborate with the UN and NGOs to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps” in areas it controls, according to the statement, which was released on social media.

Aid agencies have warned that responding to the disaster will be complex, given the conflict and the severe level of need. Even before the earthquake 15 million people – about a third of the country's population – were estimated to be facing acute food insecurity. The conflict has displaced 3.5 million people and pushed the economy and health services into crisis.

The junta has been repeatedly accused of weaponsing aid, blocking supplies to areas where its opponents are present.

An assessment by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said hospitals and health facilities warned of “a severe shortage of medical supplies” and said damage to infrastructure such as roads was hampering efforts to respond to the earthquake.

In some of the country's hardest-hit areas, people told Reuters that government assistance was scarce so far, leaving people to fend for themselves. The entire town of Sagaing near the quake's epicentre was devastated, said Han Zin, a local person.

“What we are seeing here is widespread destruction – many buildings have collapsed into the ground,” he said by phone, adding that much of the town had been without electricity since the disaster hit and drinking water was running out. “We have received no aid, and there are no rescue workers in sight.”

But some aid and rescue personnel were beginning to arrive. Indian military aircraft made sorties into Myanmar on Saturday, including ferrying supplies and search-and-rescue crews to Naypyidaw, the purpose-made capital, parts of which have been wrecked by the earthquake.

The Indian army will help set up a field hospital in Mandalay, and two navy ships carrying supplies are heading to Myanmar's commercial capital of Yangon, said India's foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.

Teams of Chinese rescue personnel have arrived, including one that crossed overland from its south-western province of Yunnan, China's embassy in Myanmar said on social media.

A 78-member team from Singapore, accompanied by rescue dogs, was operating in Mandalay on Sunday, Myanmar state media said.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement that “destruction has been extensive, and humanitarian needs are growing by the hour”. 
 It added: “With temperatures rising and the monsoon season approaching in just weeks, there is an urgent need to stabilise affected communities before secondary crises emerge.”

He's been called the Quad God, skating's great innovator, the next Olympic champion. On Saturday night, in front of a roaring crowd at TD Garden, Ilia Malinin made it official: he is once again the best figure skater in the world.

The 20-year-old American conjured another sensational free skate to close out the world figure skating championships, landing a record-tying six quadruple jumps in strolling to his second straight world title. His season-best total score of 318.56 landed him a yawning 31.09 points clear of Kazakhstan's Mikhail Shaidorov, who captured silver with a personal-best routine, and Japan's Yuma Kagiyama, who dropped from second place to the bronze after an error-strewn long program.

Malinin's triumph capped a historic weekend for the United States, who won three of the four gold medals on offer for the first time ever at a figure skating worlds. He joined newly crowned women's champion Alysa Liu and ice dance winners Madison Chock and Evan Bates atop the podium – a dominant showing that sends a clear message heading into next year's Winter Olympics in Milan.

Skating last to I'm Not a Vampire by the American post-metalcore band Falling in Reverse, Malinin opened with a quadruple flip before landing the mythical quad Axel – the four-and-a-half-revolution jump that has proven beyond the reach of the sport's most ambitious talents. From there, he added a quad loop, quad Lutz, quad toe and quad Salchow, the latter two in combination. Only a popped Lutz midway through the program kept him from attempting all seven quads.

The quad Axel been landed only 15 times in competition after Saturday, all of them by the northern Virginia native, since he first pulled it off at the US Classic two years ago when he was 17.

Malinin punctuated the programs with a seemingly effortless backflip – he and fourth-place finisher Adam Siao Him Fa of France became the first skaters to land the recently legalized move at a world championships in nearly 50 years – before striking his finishing pose to a standing ovation from another sellout crowd at the home of the NHL's Boston Bruins.

“I just fought for every element and I'm happy that I got this,” Malinin said.

The performance extended Malinin's win streak to nine consecutive events dating back to December 2023. His margin of victory was the second-largest in men's history under the modern scoring system, trailing only Nathan Chen's 47.63-point blowout in 2018. Barring injury, it's difficult to envision a timeline where Malinin won't be the overwhelming favorite for Olympic gold 10 months from now in Milan.

Of the six quads Malinin landed on Saturday, none made him happier than the loop – a jump that had given him fits all season. “I feel very relieved that I was able to put out that performance the way I tried,” he said. “It wasn't what I planned to and of course there's a few minor things that I can keep improving but overall I feel pretty confident and I'm really happy for landing the quad loop finally this season.”

Malinin, the son of former Olympians from Uzbekistan who relocated to Virginia, was controversially left off the US Olympic team in 2022 despite finishing second at nationals. Since landing the first quad Axel in competition later that year, he has redefined the technical ceiling of the sport – and continues to raise it.

Behind him, Shaidorov delivered a personal-best free skate with four clean quads, including a triple Axel-Euler-quad Salchow combination, to his Moonlight Sonata-Take On Me mashup to earn Kazakhstan's first world medal in any figure skating discipline. The 20-year-old from Almaty, who also won Four Continents in February, surged past Kagiyama after the Japanese star struggled to stay upright through his jumps.

“If someone had asked me at the beginning of the season that I would be on the world podium, I never would have believed it,” Shaidorov said. “The season was difficult but at the same time it was a breakthrough, and I'm just crazily happy to be on a world podium with such great skaters as Ilia and Yuma, and now I just want to keep moving forward.”

Kagiyama, the reigning Olympic silver medalist and three-time world silver medalist, entered the free skate just 3.32 points behind Malinin. But falls on his Salchow and a step-out on the triple Axel during his Flamenco routine to Ameksa and Romanza derailed any shot at gold. His score of 278.19 was enough for bronze, his fourth major international medal.

France's Kevin Aymoz (272.52) and world championship debutant Shun Sato of Japan (270.56) came in fifth and sixth, respectively. Among the other Americans, Jason Brown delivered a clean, expressive program that earned him eighth place and a standing ovation. Andrew Torgashev finished 22nd after a difficult free skate, but together they ensured Team USA will send the maximum three men to the 2026 Olympics.

For all the excitement surrounding Saturday's final segment of the championships, a current of grief ran beneath the competition all week. On Wednesday night, TD Garden paused for a 20-minute tribute to the 28 members of the skating community who died in January's plane crash near Washington DC. Many of the victims – young skaters, coaches, and parents – were returning from a national development camp. Among them were several who trained at Malinin's home rink in Virginia.

“They're always in my heart,” he said earlier this week. “I wanted to skate for them. I hope I made them proud.”

Earlier Saturday, Madison Chock and Evan Bates became the first ice dancers to win three consecutive world championships in nearly three decades, holding off longtime Canadian frenemies Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier. Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson took the bronze, becoming the first Britons to win a medal at worlds in any discipline since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean won the last of their four consecutive ice dance titles in 1984.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

European officials say sanctions on Russia and plans for troops in Ukraine show they hold some cards, too.

BRUSSELS — In rejecting Russia's demand to lift Western sanctions in exchange for a ceasefire in the Black Sea, European leaders are showing they could still be players in Washington's talks.

Europe is seeking to retain its leverage as President Donald Trump moves to strike a deal with Russia to stop the war in Ukraine. But some of Russia's key demands — including sanctions relief and the end of military aid to Ukraine — require European buy-in.

Still, the European campaign for a postwar force in Ukraine has yielded mixed results. As London and Paris forge ahead with military plans, their efforts have met reluctance from other European powers to commit troops in the absence of U.S. promises of support.

European officials have been more assertive on sanctions, which have emerged as a sticking point in the U.S. push to expand a fragile, limited ceasefire in Ukraine to the Black Sea. The Kremlin last week conditioned such a ceasefire on the lifting of Western sanctions on Russia.

For the Europeans, French President Emmanuel Macron said this is “not the time” to lift sanctions. Speaking after he hosted around 30 leaders in Paris on Thursday, he said it won't be time until “peace is clearly established.”

European officials accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin of stalling on a ceasefire to extract concessions and to drive a deeper wedge between Europe and the Trump administration in talks that could reshape the continent's security.

Europe controls sanctions that Russia wants lifted and which exclude it from the Belgium-based SWIFT payment system. That measure and others are reviewed by the European Union every six months and require the consent of the bloc's 27 members to be renewed. Hungary, which is friendly with Moscow, has regularly threatened to block their renewal.

European leaders have held firm so far. As one official put it, if the Kremlin wants to talk sanctions, “everyone will have to talk to us.” But diplomats are wary of being cast as blocking negotiations if the Trump team wavers on sanctions. That could put them on a collision course when they're already clashing over trade and defense.

European leaders have turned to a favorite mantra of Trump's, “peace through strength.” Macron said Thursday that doesn't mean “starting by lifting sanctions.” He said they would continue “conveying our vision” in dialogue with the United States, and that “we must be able to defend our interests.”

Many here are doubtful that a lasting ceasefire will be reached soon, said a second European official who, like others in this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. Some diplomats describe the European planning, including to send troops to Ukraine, as an exercise in preparation and leverage.

European officials concede that easing sanctions will be part of negotiations, though in their vision, a temporary ceasefire should be holding first. The talks could then turn to questions such as sanctions, leading eventually to a settlement that gives Ukraine a deterrent against another Russian invasion.

The bulwark for a postwar Ukraine, France and Britain say, could be a deployment of the European “coalition of the willing” to help safeguard Ukrainian cities and key sites away from the front line, and to provide logistical support or training to the Ukrainian army.

The countries plan to send a military team to Ukraine in the coming weeks to determine how many troops would be needed for this “reassurance force,” and where they should be stationed. And they will confer with Ukraine on beefing up its army to hold a future front line.

The European focus has also shifted to air and sea power, two diplomats said, as army chiefs point out the limitations of a large troop deployment, and as other countries propose their capabilities for patrols in Ukraine's skies or in the Black Sea.

Military planners from dozens of countries were “coming forward with contributions on everything from logistics and command and control, to deployments on land, air and sea,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.

Still, hours of negotiations have yielded no public commitment from other European leaders, amid skepticism that the U.S. has any interest in backing such a force.

Some countries have balked at the idea of deploying forces without a U.S. promise to step in if Russia attacks them. European officials also hope for U.S. capabilities such as air defenses, intelligence and heavy airlift.

“My wish is that the Americans are engaged at our side,” Macron told reporters. “But we have to be prepared for a situation in which they maybe don't join in. … We can't say that if the Americans don't join us, we won't do anything.”

Trump has offered no promises. Officials in his team give mixed signals even in private, European diplomats say. Trump Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, who has played a key role in negotiations with Russia, recently described the initiative as “simplistic.”

But a French official said Trump has not excluded U.S. backing, and that efforts were being done “in perfect harmony with our Americans partners, who are interested in this approach and have told us it's a good one.”

“In theory,” European troops could be dispatched regardless of whether that's agreed in U.S.-Russia talks, said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group consultancy, in an analysis note. “But in practice, such a force would scare or reassure no one without a U.S. guarantee.”

Monitoring a ceasefire would fall to satellite observation, U.N. peacekeepers or other monitors, which could include countries that Russia sees as neutral, officials said. That peacekeeping job would not be up to the European force, which could be stationed around nuclear sites, military bases or government headquarters.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has warned the French-British plans “could lead to a direct clash” between Russia and the NATO alliance.

Macron and Starmer say it's not up to Russia to veto European deployments to Ukraine. The French president has pledged that any troops sent to Ukraine would not cause a reduction of forces in Eastern Europe — where countries near Russia's borders worry that a deployment could stretch their own defenses. Some, such as Poland, have said they would provide logistical backup instead of their own forces.

Others are also swayed by politics at home. Germany has been hesitant to commit troops but its position is uncertain, as leaders pursue talks to form a new government. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, under pressure from her government partners, has opposed sending soldiers.

Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, a former commander of U.S. Army Europe, said a force would need a clearly defined mission “before anybody talks about numbers of troops.” That includes a unified command, he said, and consensus on how to respond to attacks.

“If they're there to deter Russia from violating a ceasefire, if there's ever a real ceasefire that's put in place, then they have to be able to do things,” he said. “The Russians would probably be reluctant to launch missiles at a city if they knew there were French troops there, for example, but they will test them.”

Syrian's interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa promised a “new phase” as he appointed the 22-member cabinet.

DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria's interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa announced a new cabinet on Saturday, reflecting a more diverse range of Syrians amid international pressure for inclusivity but set within a transitional system that ultimately keeps power tightly within his own hands.

The president's office named 22 ministers, many of whom were technocrats. The most powerful portfolios — the foreign, defense and interior ministries — remained under the purview of Sharaa's confidants.

Only one woman was among the appointees, Social Affairs Minister Hind Kabawat, who is a Christian. Raed al-Saleh, the head of the White Helmets, the volunteer organization that worked to pull survivors from the rubble of airstrikes during Syria's 14-year-long civil war, was appointed minister for disaster, emergencies and environment.

“We witness the birth of a new phase of our national journey,” Sharaa said at a ceremony at the presidential palace to mark the new cabinet's appointment, saying that the first new government since the ouster of former president Bashar al-Assad “reflects our shared will to build a new state.”

U.S. and European officials have said they are closely monitoring the new leader's commitment to diversity as they weigh releasing Syria from the Western sanctions that targeted Assad's regime. When Sharaa's forces swept into power in December, he temporarily filled his ministries with Sunni Islamist officials from his regional quasi-state in the northern province of Idlib, promising a new and more inclusive cabinet in three months.

But a new constitutional declaration earlier this month has compounded concerns over limits to Sharaa's powers as he leads Syria through its political transition. Laying out the framework for governance for the next five years, it nixed with the role of prime minister and gave Sharaa the ability to appoint judges and members of the legislature.

“We need more than one person at the top,” said Rim Turkmani, a senior research fellow at the London School of Economics. “The setup that was determined by interim constitution already undermined the incoming government,” she said. A single woman in the cabinet is “not inclusive,” she said.

Having a separate prime minister to steer the government is a “missed opportunity” especially when it comes to lobbying for sanctions relief, she added.

The European Union has suspended sanctions on some key sectors, including energy and transportation, but restrictions that remain are hindering foreign investment and postwar reconstruction desperately needed in the war-shattered country.

Bloodshed earlier this month on the Syrian coast, when clashes between government forces and armed groups from the Alawite minority loyal to the former regime spiraled into sectarian bloodletting, have underscored calls for a representative, civilian-led government.

In his speech on Saturday, Sharaa said the new government would focus on rebuilding state institutions, addressing Syria's economic woes, promoting fundamental rights and freedoms, and working on the education and health sectors.

Including members of Syria's Alawite, Kurdish, Druze and Christian minorities as well as other Syrians outside Sharaa's Sunni Islamist milieu, the cabinet may help placate Western demands for broader representation, said Radwan Ziadeh, a senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington.

“It's inclusive. It's focused on looking forward rather than looking at the conflict of the past,” he said.

Others saw it as a step in the process. “The most important thing is that the process of change in Syria begins and that the transitional phase moves forward,” said Alia Mansour, a Syrian columnist.

Follow:


            The Danish foreign minister on Saturday scolded the Trump administration for its “tone” in criticizing Denmark and Greenland, saying his country is already investing more into Arctic security and remains open to more cooperation with the United States.
    


            Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen made the remarks in a video posted to social media after US Vice President JD Vance's visit to the strategic island.
    


            “Many accusations and many allegations have been made. And of course we are open to criticism,” Rasmussen said speaking in English. “But let me be completely honest: we do not appreciate the tone in which it is being delivered. This is not how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.”

            Vance on Friday said Denmark had “underinvested” in Greenland's security and demanded that Denmark change its approach as President Donald Trump pushes to take over the Danish territory.
    


            Vance visited US troops on Pituffik Space Base on mineral-rich Greenland alongside his wife and other senior US officials for a trip that was ultimately scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danes who were not consulted about the original itinerary.
    


            “Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,” Vance said Friday. “You have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change.”
    


            Vance said the US had “no option” but to take a significant position to ensure the security of Greenland as he encouraged a push in Greenland for independence from Denmark.
    


            “I think that they ultimately will partner with the United States,” Vance said. “We could make them much more secure. We could do a lot more protection. And I think they'd fare a lot better economically as well.”
    


            The reaction by members of Greenland's parliament and residents has rendered that unlikely, with anger erupting over the Trump administration's attempts to annex the vast Arctic island. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen pushed back on Vance's claim that Denmark isn't doing enough for defense in the Arctic, calling her country “a good and strong ally.”
    


            And Greenlandic lawmakers on Thursday agreed to form a new government, banding together to resist Trump's overtures. Four of the five parties elected to Greenland's parliament earlier this month have agreed to form a coalition that will have 23 of 31 seats in the legislature.
    


            Løkke Rasmussen, in his video, reminded viewers of the 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations on the island, he said, to the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest with some 200 soldiers today.
    


            The 1951 agreement “offers ample opportunity for the United States to have a much stronger military presence in Greenland,” the foreign minister said. “If that is what you wish, then let us discuss it.”
    


            Løkke Rasmussen added that Denmark had increased its own investment into Arctic defense. In January, Denmark announced 14.6 billion Danish kroner ($2.1 billion) in financial commitments for Arctic security covering three new naval vessels, long-range drones and satellites.

A 7.7 magnitude earthquake shook Southeast Asia on Friday, March 28, causing widespread damage as it hit Myanmar with an epicenter near Mandalay, Myanmar 's second largest city, with tremors felt strongly across Thailand and also in China. The earthquake, which ruptured along the Sagaing Fault, was followed by a strong 6.4magnitude aftershock, and caused widespread damage.

A 33-story building under construction near the popular Chatuchak market in Bangkok, Thailand's capital city, collapsed. Footage of the building's demise shows crowds of onlookers running away from the rubble in panic.

According to the Associated Press, as of Sunday afternoon in Thailand, a total of 18 people have been reported killed by the earthquake so far. 11 of which were at the site of the collapse of the high-rise building under construction. Dozens of people are said to be unaccounted for.

In Myanmar, the earthquake's death toll, per the AP, has exceeded 1,600, citing government officials Saturday evening, with numbers expected to rise as recovery efforts continue. In addition, authorities report over 3,000 people are injured, with over 100 others missing.

On Sunday, March 30, a 5.1 magnitude aftershock struck near Mandalay, prompting alarm before rescue efforts continued.

Amnesty International's Myanmar researcher Joe Freeman said in a statement on Friday that the earthquake “could not come at a worse time” for the country as it still reels from the 2021 military coup and subsequent displacement of masses in a civil war.

Per reports of a local televised speech, Myanmar's ruling military junta declared a state of emergency in several regions affected by the earthquake on Friday, and called for humanitarian aid in a rare show of international appeal.

The United Nations allocated $5 million to start relief efforts. Myanmar's government has also said that blood donations are in high demand for the wounded. Teams from the Myanmar Red Cross Society are reportedly working to connect hospitals and clinics with emergency blood donations.

Donald Trump has said he is “not joking” about trying to serve a third term as US president.

“There are methods which you could do it,” he said in a telephone interview with NBC News, in the clearest indication yet that he is considering ways to breach a constitutional barrier against continuing to lead the country after his second term ends in 2029.

But he added: “It is far too early to think about it.”

The 22nd Amendment, which was added to the constitution in 1951 after Franklin D Roosevelt was elected as president four times in a row, says: “No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice.”

NBC's Kristen Welker asked Mr Trump if one potential route to a third term was having vice president JD Vance run for the top job and “then pass the baton to you”.

“Well, that's one,” the president responded. “But there are others too. There are others.”

“Can you tell me another?” she asked.

“No,” he replied.

Mr Trump has mused before about serving longer than two terms, generally with jokes to friendly audiences.

The prime minister of Greenland has pushed back against assertions by Donald Trump that the US will take control of the island territory.

Greenland, a huge, resource-rich island in the Atlantic, is a self-governing territory of Denmark, a Nato ally of the US.

The US president wants to annex the territory, claiming it is needed for national security purposes.

“President Trump says that the United States ‘will get Greenland.' Let me be clear: The United States will not get it. We do not belong to anyone else. We decide our own future,” Jens-Frederik Nielsen wrote in a Facebook post.

It came a day after the president told NBC News that military force was not off the table with regard to acquiring Greenland.

In Saturday's interview, Mr Trump said: “I think there's a good possibility that we could do it without military force.

“This is world peace, this is international security.”

He added: “I don't take anything off the table.”

Greenland's residents and politicians have reacted with anger to his repeated suggestions, with Danish leaders also criticising them.

Mr Trump said “I don't care” when asked in the NBC interview what message this would send to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has invaded Ukraine and annexed several of its provinces in defiance of international law.

A 5.1-magnitude earthquake hit near Myanmar's second-largest city on Sunday, the latest in a string of aftershocks following Friday's devastating temblor.

People in the streets of Mandalay screamed as the aftershock – which was recorded by the United States Geological Survey – hit.

Emergency rescue teams have started trickling into the area of the country hardest hit by Friday's massive quake that killed more than 1,600 people.

Their efforts have been hindered by buckled roads, downed bridges, poor communications and the challenges of operating in a country in the midst of a civil war.

The 7.7-magnitude quake hit at midday on Friday with an epicentre near Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, bringing down scores of buildings and damaging other infrastructure like the city's airport.

Many of Mandalay's 1.5 million people spent the night sleeping on the streets, either left homeless by the quake, which also shook neighbouring Thailand and killed at least 17 people there, or worried that the continuing aftershocks might cause structures left unstable to collapse.

So far, 1,644 people have been reported killed in Myanmar and 3,408 missing, but many areas have not yet been reached, and many rescue efforts so far have been undertaken by people working by hand to try and clear rubble, said Cara Bragg, the Yangon-based manager of Catholic Relief Services in Myanmar.

“It's mainly been local volunteers, local people who are just trying to find their loved ones,” Ms Bragg said after being briefed by her colleague in Mandalay.

The organisation was sending a team by road on Sunday to assess the most pressing needs so that it could target its own response.

With the Mandalay airport damaged and the control tower toppled in the capital Yangon's Naypitaw airport, all commercial flights into the cities have been shut down.

Still, two Indian C-17 military transport aircraft were able to land late on Saturday at Naypitaw with a field hospital unit and some 120 personnel who were then to travel north to Mandalay to establish a 60-bed emergency treatment centre, according to the country's foreign ministry.

Other Indian supplies were flown into Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city, which has been the hub of other foreign relief efforts.

On Sunday, a convoy of 17 Chinese cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies was expected to reach Mandalay after making the arduous 400-mile journey by road from Yangon.

An initial report on earthquake relief efforts issued on Saturday by the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted the severe damage or destruction of many health facilities, and warned a “severe shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers”.

China said it has sent more than 135 rescue personnel and experts along with supplies like medical kits and generators, and pledged around 13.8 million US dollars (£10.65 million) in emergency aid.

Russia's emergencies ministry said it had flown in 120 rescuers and supplies to Yangon, and the country's health ministry said Moscow had sent a medical team to Myanmar.

Rescue efforts are complicated by the bloody civil war roiling much of the country, including in quake-affected areas.

In 2001, the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has since turned into significant armed resistance.

Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar and many places are dangerous or impossible for aid groups to reach.

More than three million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations.

The government military has been fighting long-established militias and newly-formed pro-democracy People's Defence Forces (PDF), and has heavily restricted much-needed aid efforts to the large population already displaced by war even before the earthquake.

On Saturday, Myanmar's opposition shadow National Unity Government, to which the PDF militias are loyal, announced a unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts.

The military did not immediately comment on the announcement and it continued air strikes even after the earthquake.

The Three Brotherhood Alliance, a group of three of Myanmar's most powerful and well-armed militias that launched a combined offensive in October 2023 that broke a strategic stalemate with the military regime, did not mention a ceasefire in a statement Saturday, but said it was ready to help.

At least 144 people were killed and more than 730 injured after a 7.7-magnitude quake struck near the city of Mandalay, according to the head of Myanmar's military government, who warned that casualties are likely to rise.

On a comment by English-American computer scientist whether “lots of people need to be awake when load is high”, Sam Altman wrote that he has never seen anything like this.

“We just haven't been able to catch up since launch so people are still working to keep the service up… biblical demand, I have never seen anything like it,” Sam Altman said.

To another comment which read, “If you keep netfing the model, people will stop using it. Otherwise, no.”, Sam Altman said, “we are gonna do the opposite of nerfing it BUT still please chill out a bit”.

The integration of Studio Ghibli's art style with ChatGPT's generative tools led to a flood of online content with people turning their everyday images, from portraits to landscapes, into whimsical, dreamlike illustrations reminiscent of Ghibli films like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro.

Since the feature was released, users have taken to platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and TikTok, sharing their AI-generated Ghibli-inspired art, resulting in hashtags like #Ghiblified or #GhibliArt consistently trending, with everyone from regular users to politicians, influencers, celebrities, and even brands using the tool.

The Studio Ghibli trend has also led to ethical concerns about artificial intelligence tools trained on copyrighted creative works and what that means for the future livelihoods of human artists.

The recent introduction of OpenAI's image generation feature in ChatGPT has ignited a Studio Ghibli trend that's breaking the internet. For the last couple of days, images in the style of Studio Ghibli have taken over the internet, captivating millions with their whimsical charm. Fans across social media have embraced AI-aided transformations that have turned their favoruite photographs into artwork inspired by the style of the renowned Japanese animation studio, celebrated for classics like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro.

In fact, the craze for this trend is such that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently took to social media, begging fans to give it a rest as his company's GPUs are melting and employees are going sleepless. “Can yall please chill on generating images this is insane our team needs sleep,” he requested on X.

Inspired by the Studio Ghibli trend, we turned 10 iconic Bollywood movie screenshots into Ghibli-inspired artworks. Only a true-blue Bollywood fan will be able to guess these movies based on the Studio Ghibli images.

Sophie Chandauka says duke unleashed ‘Sussex machine' but source close to ex-trustees claims accusation baseless

The chair of a charity set up by Prince Harry has accused him of “harassment and bullying at scale” after he and several others quit the organisation earlier this week.

The Duke of Sussex was said to have initiated the campaign by the “unleashing of the Sussex machine”.

Dr Sophie Chandauka, the chair of the charity Sentebale, which helps children and adolescents struggling to come to terms with diagnoses of HIV and Aids, told Trevor Phillips on Sky News: “The only reason I'm here … is because at some point on Tuesday, Prince Harry authorised the release of a damaging piece of news to the outside world without informing me or my country directors, or my executive director. That is an example of harassment and bullying at scale.”

On Tuesday, Prince Harry quit as patron of the charity. He released a joint statement with co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, claiming they had been forced to step down “in support of and solidarity with” the board of trustees who had also resigned, due to a dispute with Chandauka, which reportedly arose from a decision to focus fundraising in Africa.

Harry and Seeiso wrote that the relationship “broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation”.

Sky News reported that one of its sources, who is “close to the former trustees of the Sentebale charity”, said that Chandauka's accusation that she was bullied by Prince Harry and the “Sussex machine” was completely baseless.

In a statement earlier this week, Chandauka said: “There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct.

“Beneath all the victim narrative and fiction that has been syndicated to the press is the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir – and the cover-up that ensued.”

Sentebale was set up in 2006 by Harry after spending two months in Lesotho during his gap year in 2004.

The prince's acrimonious departure from the charity comes five years after he told a Sentebale dinner party in 2020: “When I lost my mum … you took me under your wing. You looked out for me for so long. Together, you have given me an education about living, and this role has taught me more about what is right and just than I could ever have imagined,” he told dinner guests. “We are taking a leap of faith, so thank you for giving me the courage to take this next step.”

Representatives for Harry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Some 2 billion Muslims around the globe gathered with loved ones to celebrate the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.

About 2 billion Muslims around the world celebrated Eid al-Fitr on Sunday, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, when adherents fast from dawn until dusk.

In festive, colorful celebrations, families and friends from Morocco to Nigeria, Sudan to Albania, and Gaza to India gathered for shared feasts, exchanged gifts, attended communal prayers and spent time with their loved ones.

During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims abstain from eating and drinking during daylight hours, beginning their fast after a pre-sunrise meal and breaking it with iftar, a dinner at sunset. It's usually a time for reflection and deeper connection to faith and community.

Ramadan officially ends when a new crescent moon is sighted, marking the beginning of the month of Shawwal, which happened Saturday.

In the Gaza Strip, about 2 million Palestinian Muslims observed the end of Ramadan with muted commemorations after Israel's recent resumption of military operations in the enclave, breaking the relative calm of a two-month ceasefire.

Some Gazans visited the graves of relatives, while others prayed on carpets splayed atop rubble or near destroyed mosques.

“It's the Eid of sadness,” Adel al-Shaer in Deir al-Balah told the Associated Press.

In Sudan, Muslims marked another Eid under the shadow of civil war, a conflict between the country's army and a rival paramilitary force that has killed more than 150,000 people in nearly two years, according to some estimates.

Many people — including in Indonesia, where the tradition is called “mudik” — hopped onto trains, buses and boats to flee towns and cities and return home to celebrate the holiday with family.

In some countries, it's traditional for elders to give money to younger family members. Some serve traditional meals such as lemang, a Southeast Asian dish of glutinous rice cooked in coconut milk, or sweets like kahk — crumbly, sugarcoated cookies eaten widely in Egypt.

Eid prayers are offered in the morning, often in open spaces. In the holy city of Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, hundreds of thousands of Muslims prayed Sunday at the Grand Mosque.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Faye Hall is one of four Americans known to have been released by the Taliban this year. She called on President Trump to help other women jailed in Afghanistan.

The Taliban released an American citizen, Faye Hall, who was detained in Afghanistan, a former U.S. ambassador said Saturday.

Hall “is now in the care of our friends, the Qataris in Kabul, and will soon be on her way home,” wrote Zalmay Khalilzad, who was a U.S. special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation until 2021 and the former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq.

Hall is the fourth U.S. citizen known to be released by the Taliban this year.

“Thank you for bringing me home, and I've never been so proud to be an American citizen,” Hall said in a video celebrating her release, posted by President Donald Trump on Truth Social.

“I just want you to know, all the women in the Afghan jail, they always ask me, ‘When is Trump coming?'” Hall said in the video, addressing Trump. “They are waiting for you to come and set them free. … Don't want to forget all those women who are still in jail and don't have any rights,” she added.

The State Department did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

Earlier this month, Khalilzad announced the release of another American citizen, George Glezmann, who worked as a Delta Air Lines mechanic and had been detained for two years for unknown reasons. Khalilzad called Glezmann's release a “goodwill gesture” from the Taliban to Trump and the American people and praised Trump for making “the freedom and homecoming of Americans held abroad a high priority.”

In January, President Joe Biden secured the release of two other Americans, Ryan Corbett and William W. McKenty III, who were let go as the Taliban announced a prisoner swap between the U.S. and Afghanistan and after what Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (New Hampshire), the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, called “intense behind-the-scenes efforts by U.S. officials.”

The Taliban at the time identified one freed Afghan prisoner, Khan Mohammed, who it said was arrested in the Afghan province of Nangarhar nearly two decades ago and was serving a life sentence in California.

Corbett, a father from New York, ran a social enterprise organization that worked with NGOs to help Afghan citizens start their own businesses. He was detained by the Taliban for nearly two and a half years, according to his family, who say they suspect he was taken into custody to be used as political leverage.

Last year, members of Congress called for the release of U.S. citizen and civil aviation engineer Mahmood Habibi, who they said “was wrongfully detained by the Taliban.” In a House resolution, officials said Habibi was arrested in August 2022 because the Taliban “made an assumption” that his employer — a Kabul-based telecommunications company — “might have been involved” in a U.S. drone strike on Kabul that killed an al-Qaeda leader.

Habibi has yet to be released. In August, the FBI made a public request for any further information about his disappearance.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Discover the history of our feline friends, and learn about the debate over whether cats are really ""domesticated"" at all.

The domestic cat is one of the smallest members of the family Felidae — the group that includes lions, tigers, jaguars and cougars. It is also the only member of that family that has been domesticated.

Cats have lived among humans for thousands of years. They probably started hanging around human grain stores, attracted by mice and other vermin, and eventually spread around the world as sailors brought them aboard ships.

Today, cats still help humans control pests, as well as provide companionship. In the past few centuries, humans have bred some cats to display certain traits, like hairlessness, thereby establishing dozens of cat breeds. With their charming mix of aloofness and goofiness, cats continue to amuse and fascinate us.

Cats were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Today's domestic cats descend from Felis silvestris lybica, a wildcat subspecies found in Africa and the Middle East. Genes from cats found in archaeological sites in the Middle East, Europe and Africa reveal that about 10,000 years ago, in modern-day Turkey, cats started to associate with humans and split from their wild relatives. 

Despite having relatively small natural ranges, F. s. lybica showed up in eastern Europe by 4400 B.C., according to ancient cat DNA found at archaeological sites. This suggests that cats hitched rides aboard ships with traders, who probably appreciated that cats kept rats in check. Cats certainly traveled long distances: DNA from Egyptian cats has been found as far as a Viking site in northern Germany dating to between A.D. 700 and 1000. 

The oldest known burial of a domesticated cat comes from Cyprus, where a human and a cat were buried together 9,500 years ago. Cat bones also have been found buried in 5,300-year-old refuse pits in China.

Cats took on a starring role in ancient Egypt. Scientists aren't yet sure whether the Egyptians domesticated cats separately from the Middle East lineage, or whether the cats spread from Turkey to Egypt. 

Either way, Egyptians treasured cats' protectiveness and independence and saw the traits of their gods in cats. Cats were sometimes even mummified lovingly next to their deceased owners, but they were also sacrificed in large numbers during religious rituals. Bastet, a feline-headed goddess, was worshipped as a protector and as a deity of pregnancy and childbirth.

You might hear that cats ""domesticated themselves."" This is because ancient wildcats likely chose to hang around human agricultural settlements, resulting in a mutually beneficial relationship between cats and humans. These settlements provided ample food and shelter for cats. 

Because the cats helped keep vermin at bay, the people who inhabited these settlements tolerated — and eventually welcomed — cats' presence. Whereas humans domesticated dogs through artificial selection by breeding for desirable traits, domestic cats evolved simply through natural selection, as friendlier and more docile cats thrived in close contact with humans. 

Cats are not as domesticated as dogs are. Whereas cats were domesticated about 10,000 years ago, genetic evidence suggests that dogs were domesticated between 14,000 and 30,000 years ago. It's still up for debate exactly how and why some wild wolves evolved into friendly house pets, but it is clear that humans have spent much more time and effort shaping the genetic makeup of domestic dogs.

In fact, scientists say that even today, cats are ""only just"" domesticated. Many domestic cats are actually feral, meaning they live outside of human captivity and can fend for themselves. Feral cats and house cats also regularly interbreed, so house cats retain many of their ""wild"" instincts. 

People also bred domestic dogs for thousands of years based on their skills and personalities, whereas humans started breeding domestic cats only within the past few centuries. This means dogs' temperaments tend to be more predictable and aligned with human needs than cats'. 

Even now, modern-day cats are categorized primarily by appearance. Although appearance is also a factor in canine breeding, historically, abilities such as tracking game, herding sheep and guarding property were more important.

Figure 02's human-like gait is the product of the company's simulated reinforcement learning system, and is just the beginning of its plans to make its robots perform physical tasks more naturally.

A U.S. robotics company has used artificial intelligence (AI) to give its humanoid robots a more natural-looking stride, and they say it's just the beginning.

In the promotional video, the robot, called Figure 02 and manufactured by the company Figure, marches with a ""human-like"" gait. This is an ability it claims will help its robot to navigate the physical world more easily.

""These initial results are exciting, but we believe they only hint at the full potential of our technology,"" company representatives wrote in a blog post accompanying its announcement. ""We're committed to extending our learned policy to handle every human-like scenario the robot might face in the real world.""

Robots have been running, cartwheeling, doing backflips, breakdancing, and beating us at chess for years now. But performing tasks that appear simple to humans, such as walking in a straight line, gripping objects, tying shoelaces, and navigating social situations, have proven tough for robots to master.

The problem, known as Moravec's Paradox, emerges because computers excel at problems that require complex calculations and large datasets, but lack our real-world experience honed by millions of years of evolution. This makes robots' shuffling gaits, well, robotic at best. At worst, it gives them the appearance that they may have soiled themselves.

To tackle the robot's unnatural gait, Figure's engineers used a learning technique called reinforcement learning — placing thousands of virtual robots inside a physics simulator that recreates various terrains, thereby improving their walking through trial and error.

By rewarding the virtual robot army for natural motions, they refined their gaits to appear more human-like. With this task accomplished, they uploaded the refined ""Learned Natural Walking"" model to a real-world Figure 02 robot. The result is an android that can move somewhat naturally, with heel strikes, toe-offs and synchronized arm swings.

Figure's reinforcement learning technique is key to the California company's plans to roll out its robots on factory floors. It has already tested its humanoid robots in a BMW factory in 2024 and plans to introduce more this year. Meanwhile, Apptronik, a Texas-based competitor, is also commercializing its humanoid robot, Apollo, for use in Mercedes-Benz factories by the end of 2025. Agility Robotics' Digit will also be introduced into warehouses this year.

In a first year that ended in a 71-53 NCAA Tournament Round of 32 loss to Alabama in 2023, new Maryland coach Kevin Willard had complaints. Plenty of them. 

He was quick to tell anyone who would listen how much better things were in the Big East, the league he had just left after 12 seasons at Seton Hall. The scheduling, the travel, the emphasis on college basketball above all else.  

Willard had issues with the Big Ten's schedule and travel situations, which would only get worse when USC, UCLA, Oregon and Washington officially joined the conference, but it didn't raise alarms early on the way maybe it should have. Many Maryland boosters and athletic department staffers were already used to dealing with similar complaints from Mark Turgeon, Willard's predecessor, who frequently complained about the school's decision to leave the basketball-fabled Atlantic Coast Conference for the Big Ten in 2014.  

The hope was that Willard would settle in at the Big Ten school and get it back on track to the heights of the Gary Williams era that resulted in a 2002 national championship.  

In hindsight, though, Willard's comparisons to the Big East should have been a sign. Over the next two years, there were consistent whispers that Willard wasn't particularly happy at Maryland and was frustrated that the perceived ""basketball school"" didn't devote more resources to his program. It all came to a head in an ugly, more than week-long public saga that finally ended late Saturday night when Willard marked his return to his beloved Big East as Villanova's new head coach.  

Maryland is now without an athletic director and men's basketball coach on March 30 with the transfer portal in full swing. The ""Crab Five"" that made it to a Sweet 16 could all be gone from next year's roster, with guards Ja'Kobi Gillespie and Rodney Rice expected to receive considerable outside interest.  

How did we get here? It is a story of money, internal friction over where resources were devoted and a man who could never seem to be satiated.  

Almost as soon as Villanova fired Kyle Neptune after three seasons, Willard's name popped up as a realistic candidate for the position. Coaching carousel season can be full of smokescreens and fake interest to build leverage, but from the beginning sources within college basketball circles believed there was something real brewing between the two parties.  

Willard was asked about the possibility in a media availability before Maryland's first-round game against Grand Canyon and used the opportunity to publicly embarrass his current employer.  

""I need to make fundamental changes to the program. That's what I'm focused on right now. That's why probably a deal hasn't got done because I want to see -- I need to see fundamental changes done. I want this program to be great. I want it to be the best in the country, I want to win a national championship, but there's things that need to change.

When you're at a place for three years and you put your heart and soul into it, you kind of sit there and say okay, wait a second for us to be really successful X, Y and Z needs to change, first and foremost,"" Willard said. ""I need to make sure that we are where we are with NIL and rev share is not where we've been with NIL over the past two years. We've been one of the worst, if not lowest, in NIL in the last two years. So that's first and foremost. 

""I also have to make a fundamental change where I can do the things that I want to do with my program. I wanted to spend an extra night in New York this year to celebrate Christmas with my team and I was told that we can't do that because it's too expensive. So I don't know how we can be a top-tier program and I can't spend one extra night in New York because it's too expensive.""

The Christmas anecdote was especially petty, the result of a simmering feud with then-deputy AD Colleen Sorem, who has since taken over as interim AD in a move that especially rankled Willard. Sorem, who ran the day-to-day operations of the department under Evans, once told me, ""There's just not enough money in the pie. I worry about revenue. I worry about staff. I worry about keeping our staff and being able to fill slots when they open."" Sorem's job was to balance the budget, evoking ire from Willard when she turned down his requests including an extra night in New York. 

Willard's comments that day proved to be a Rorschach test for Maryland fans. Some were deeply upset that Willard aired the school's laundry in public, pouring kerosene on an already tense situation within the athletic department. Others, including some prominent basketball boosters, championed Willard's fight for more resources, believing that outgoing AD Damon Evans, who has since left for SMU, didn't do enough to help Willard.  

Evans, a former Georgia football player, knew how important men's basketball was to Maryland and its fanbase but also believed football success was critical to its long-term standing — despite admitting privately to at least one prominent booster he knew Maryland would never win a national championship in football, though could win one in basketball.  

Surveying a changing college sports ecosystem, Evans believed the football program had to be viable if Maryland were to be included in any long-rumored breakaway into a super conference. He wanted basketball to be successful, needed it to be so, but if Maryland was really going to overcome its long-standing financial problems, football was the path.  

""Football generates 80 to 90 percent of TV revenue,"" Evans told me in a previous interview. ""So that big billion-dollar contract from our multimedia rights partners, a lot of that's attributed to football. That doesn't mean that basketball is not significant because it's super significant here; basketball makes a lot of money here. But we need to understand what drives what.  

""What drives conference realignment? TV partners, football and marketplace. That drives college realignment.""  

Willard had valid NIL complaints even if his claim that Maryland had the lowest NIL in the conference was wildly inaccurate. Maryland spent in the neighborhood of $3 million in NIL for this year's roster which would put it ""in the lower part of the top half of the Big Ten,"" according to Harry Geller, the founder of Maryland basketball collective Turtle NIL. Geller said Evans not being more heavily involved in trying to help Maryland basketball's NIL situation deeply frustrated Willard, who was upset at the administration's inaction. 

""It was kind of crazy that the whole NIL for the basketball program fell on me and (former Nautica chairman) Harvey Sanders and a few others, all unpaid retired guys,"" Geller told CBS Sports. ""When Brian Ullmann became involved things got better, but we were way behind at that point.""  

Willard wanted a bigger piece of the $20.5 million revenue share, highlighting a fight that is brewing on college campuses across the country as an April settlement of House v. NCAA looms. With football programs expected to get the bulk of the revenue share, it has left basketball coaches like Willard frustrated at their share of the pie.  

Maryland, however, was willing to give Willard $4.5 million in revenue share even before he publicly demanded more, according to sources, which would be the second-highest number for a Big Ten men's basketball program behind only Indiana. The expectation is that the majority of the Power Four men's basketball programs will be in the $2 million-$4 million range in revenue sharing, putting Maryland above all but a handful of programs. Of course Villanova, without a FBS football program, can and will use more of its revenue share on basketball, with the expectation it could spend upwards of $6 million.  

There was optimism within Maryland in the days leading up to Friday's Sweet 16 game against Florida that Willard would stay after the school offered him a contract that would make him one of the top 10 highest-paid coaches in college basketball, according to multiple sources. When pressed on the Kevin Sheehan Show on Tuesday, Willard said ""As of right now, I'm staying."" There was obvious instability within the school without a permanent AD but with Ullmann, the right-hand man of school president Darryll Pines, directly dealing with Willard, Maryland believed it had met all of its basketball coach's demands.  

That optimism, however, soon turned to frustration that Willard was not negotiating in good faith and would be leaving for Villanova regardless. That all the public complaints were simply an attempt to build a case for a decision he had already privately made.  

""He played us like a drum,"" Maryland booster Barry Gossett, whose name adorns the forthcoming $52 million, 44,000-square foot basketball performance center, told CBS Sports.  

Gossett's influence is everywhere at Maryland, from the Barry P. Gossett Director of Athletics position to the Barry and Mary Gossett Center for Academic and Personal Excellence, which he donated $21.5 million to fund in 2018. The former University of Maryland system regent, who has donated upwards of $50 million to his alma mater's athletic department, said he was ""as extremely disappointed as one could be"" over how Willard handled his departure and the tough situation it left the school in searching for a new basketball coach without an athletic director.  

""As far as I'm concerned with Kevin leaving, I think it's good,"" Gossett said. ""It was just chaos.  

""Willard caused more chaos. It wasn't good for the rest of the department.""  

After an 87-71 loss to Florida to end Maryland's season, Willard was pummeled with questions about whether he'd be taking the Villanova job. He told reporters, ""I don't know what I'm doing.""  

""I haven't talked to my agent, I haven't talked to my wife,"" Willard said. ""I made a promise to this team that I was gonna just focus on this team and that's all I've done. I have an agent, I'm sure he's talking to people because that's what agents do, but I don't know."" 

However, later that night, Willard told at least one person close to him ""I'm out of here."" He met with Villanova on Saturday and officially informed Maryland around midnight that he was leaving, ending a weeklong standoff. It was a result weeks in the making despite Willard's public comments saying otherwise.  

""We took a very proactive and aggressive approach to retain Coach Willard, offering a significant contract extension and salary increase, new staff, and one of the highest revenue-share budgets in the B1G Conference,"" Maryland said in a statement about Willard's departure. ""We had long and thoughtful conversations about the program and shared the same vision for Maryland Basketball. In the end, he made the choice that he felt was best for him and his family. On behalf of all of Terrapin Nation, we thank Coach Willard and his family for their service and wish them well."" 

Willard's exit marked a disappointing conclusion to a season that reinvigorated the Maryland fanbase which fell in love with star freshman Derik Queen and the rest of the ""Crab Five."" Queen delivered perhaps the biggest moment of this NCAA Tournament on a buzzer-beater shot that knocked out Colorado State to send the Terrapins to their first Sweet 16 in nearly a decade. It should have been a time of tremendous joy for the Maryland fanbase but Willard's increasingly obvious dalliance with Villanova overshadowed it all to a point he was booed by fans ahead of the Florida game.  

Willard tried to play the victim at the end, complaining of a situation of his own making, ""I understand fans are going to be pissed because I'm in limbo and this and that. I get it. Like, I'm kind of pissed, to be honest with you, because i didn't expect to be in this situation.""  

When asked whether he would change anything about how he handled a situation that evoked justified vitriol from Terps fans at the end, Willard was defiant.  

""Nope,"" the outgoing Maryland coach said. ""Not at all."" 

The timing of Willard's departure puts Maryland in a precarious position. Without a permanent AD and a roster ripe for poaching, time is of the essence for the Terrapins to find a solution. The school is ready to commit significant resources — from revenue sharing to coaching salaries — to find the right person to lead the program. It was — and still is — one of the top basketball jobs in the country, the kind of place where you can win a national championship and have one of the best home-court environments anywhere inside the Xfinity Center. Maryland has a 65.8 win percentage since the 2014-15 season, its first in the Big Ten, which ranks 36th nationally and sixth in the conference in that span. 

In what has been the ugliest week for Maryland hoops in recent memory, with the upcoming days critical for the future of the program, there are some who still see a silver lining to Willard's childish antics.  

""I think this got the attention of the top administration about what we really need to do to run a top basketball program,"" Geller said, ""so in the end, that is good.""

Don't count on Aaron Judge, the American League's reigning Most Valuable Player Award winner, to become the next member of the New York Yankees to take up the team's new ""torpedo"" bat. Rather, Judge intends to stick to what has enabled him to succeed throughout his big-league career.

""What I did the past couple of seasons speaks for itself,"" Judge explained to reporters, including The Athletic. ""Why try to change something if you have something that's working?""

To Judge's point, he's amassed a career .288/.406/.607 slash line (174 OPS+) over the course of his first 10-plus seasons in the majors. Over that time he's received six All-Star Game designations, four Silver Slugger Awards, two MVP trophies, and both the American League and Yankees franchise single-season home-run record. In other words, the lumber Judge uses works just fine, thank you very much.

For those new to the ""torpedo"" bat concept, a few Yankees players (including Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Anthony Volpe) are using bats with altered physical properties -- essentially, the mass is shifted from the traditional barrel to the label area on the bat. The inspiration for that shape stems from a Yankees front office member. Former infielder Kevin Smith took to social media to break down the differences in the bats. Smith added the goal behind the ""torpedo"" bat is to increase barrels and decrease whiffs. 

To be clear: this is all legal. The ""torpedo"" bat falls within MLB's regulations on dimensions. Besides, it's hardly the first (and won't be the last) time players and teams have experimented with equipment modifications. All the same, you can understand why folks are raising their eyebrows about the Yankees' sticks after they plated 20 runs against the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday.

Judge with his more traditional piece of lumber, by the way, homered thrice and drove in eight runs.

What seemed inevitable for more than a week is now decided: Kevin Willard has left Maryland after three seasons to be the next coach at Villanova. 

Villanova made it official with a Sunday morning announcement.

Willard met Saturday afternoon with Villanova officials, agreeing to a deal soon thereafter, sources told CBS Sports. Maryland scheduled a team meeting Sunday morning, wherein its players would be told Willard was leaving the program.

""Villanova Basketball has a deep tradition of excellence and a culture that is second to none in college basketball,"" Willard said in a statement released by the school. ""We are thrilled to be a part of it and join the Villanova community.""

The 49-year-old's job swap marks the end of a public and messy saga that played out in part because Willard, in the past week-plus, openly talked about his issues with the way Maryland funds its men's basketball program. He also never denied involvement with Villanova, where he became a rumored candidate a few days after Kyle Neptune was fired March 15. 

""I want this program to be great,"" Willard said of Maryland last weekend while in Seattle for the Terrapins' trip for the first and second rounds. ""I want it to be the best in the country, I want to win a national championship, but there's things that need to change. … We've been one of the worst, if not lowest, in the NIL in the last two years. So that's first and foremost.""

Maryland was knocked out of the tournament in the Sweet 16 on Thursday night by top-seeded Florida 87-71. The Terps finished 27-9, their final win coming in the second round on a buzzer-beater from fab freshman Derik Queen. 

Willard walking away from Maryland felt more and more likely from within the program in the lead-up to the team's game against Florida, sources said. Another source shared that Willard had been non-responsive to some influential Maryland people in recent days, which increased the frustration from Maryland's side.

In choosing Villanova -- a private school, which means it does not have to disclose contract terms -- Willard is walking away from Maryland's offer, which was in the vicinity of $6 million annually, a source told CBS Sports. He's also fleeing from a situation that, largely of his own doing, had gotten exceedingly toxic as the NCAA Tournament continued. With Willard's business being so out in the open, he became a pariah for Maryland supporters. Returning to College Park was not a desirable option; he's now an enemy for much of that fan base.

Willard returns to the Big East, a league he coached in for a dozen years. Willard won 225 games at Seton Hall but only won one NCAA tourney game. His Sweet 16 run with Maryland is the only time he's coached a team to the second weekend of March Madness. His career record is 335-249 (.574).

The decision on Villanova's side comes after the school considered Richard Pitino, Porter Moser and a few more notable candidates who privately expressed interest, according to sources.

""Coach Willard is an outstanding leader of young men and brings extensive experience and success as a head coach to Villanova,"" Villanova athletic director Eric Roedl said. ""We are excited about the future of Villanova Basketball under his leadership, and look forward to welcoming Coach, his wife Julie, and their sons -- Colin and Chase -- to the Villanova community.""

With Maryland opening, the program will be in for a major reset at an inopportune time. It's the only high-major job without a head coach at the moment. The school has no full-time athletic director after former AD Damon Evans left in the past week to take the same job at SMU. Maryland's ""Crab Five"" starters may well have all have played their last game for the school due to NBA interest, graduation and/or NIL opportunities that await in the portal.

Without a full-time AD, and with a president that isn't overly invested in the sports side of running a university, Maryland will rely on a search firm to land its next coach. Potential names could include the likes of Texas A&M's Buzz Williams, Penn State's Mike Rhoades, American's Duane Simpkins and George Mason's Tony Skinn. In addition to those four, a swarm of Maryland fans online have been buzzing about one non-head coach with championship pedigree: 39-year-old UConn assistant Luke Murray.

Finally, some clarity for Maryland after an awkward, uncomfortable few weeks. Kevin Willard to Villanova is done. It comes days after Florida dispatched Maryland in Thursday's Sweet 16 and ended an internal saga that had turned public and a bit nasty. 

While the Crab Five was busy leading the Terps to the second weekend for the first time in a decade, Willard was unleashing numerous tongue-lashings about the direction of Maryland basketball. Frustrations with NIL were apparent. Leverage was at the epicenter of everything. 

Willard was looking for a change, and boy, did he get it. He returns to his Big East roots to money-laden Villanova, and Maryland is left staring down the reality of a complete makeover after a revival of one of the best basketball-loving programs in the Big Ten. 

The mouthpiece-chompin', Big Ten Freshman of the Year Derik Queen is undoubtedly off to the NBA. He will be a first-round pick. Julian Reese and Selton Miguel are out of eligibility. Ja'Kobi Gillespie and Rodney Rice will be coveted players in the portal. The Crab Five is no more, and Maryland has to turn the page after a phenomenal season ended sourly on and off the floor.

Maryland is lauded as one of the top 30 jobs in college basketball, but the timeline has the Terps playing catch-up in the carousel. Numerous big-name options have found destinations. Richard Pitino, who would've been a strong Willard replacement, chose Xavier. Sean Miller dipped for Texas. Ryan Odom earned the Virginia gig. Indiana, Iowa and Minnesota each feel fabulous about landing Darian DeVries, Ben McCollum and Niko Medved, respectively. Oh, and there's no athletics director to run this search after Damon Evans jetted to SMU.

So, who's next?

Williams is pushing hard for the job, according to Jeff Ermann of InsideMDSports. The 52-year-old has coached in the Big East at Marquette. He's coached in the ACC at Virginia Tech. He's coached in the SEC at Texas A&M. All that's left is the Big Ten and the Big 12 to complete the high-major quintet. 

Williams would keep the floor very high at Maryland. He built four straight 21-win teams at Texas A&M. He's gone to the NCAA Tournament six times in the last nine years. His teams play extremely hard and win the extras by dominating the glass. Poaching an SEC coach wouldn't be easy, but basketball is everything at Maryland, which isn't the case at Texas A&M. That's attractive. 

Williams in the DMV could be a bit awkward, but he's built competent rosters all over the country. In the portal era, does familiarity with the locals even matter that much anymore?

Also, there'd be real coaching carousel implications if Maryland was able to snag Williams. Texas A&M athletic director Trev Alberts could pivot to a familiar face … Nebraska's Fred Hoiberg.

Maryland could flex its superiority over Penn State in hoops by stealing Rhoades. The former Rice and VCU coach has plenty of familiarity with the Big Ten, and some of his Moneyball-like moves at Penn State have been sneaky-great. Northern Illinois transfer center Yanic Konan Niederhauser was a tremendous evaluation (and has one more year of eligibility). 

Penn State has not won big under Rhoades, but it's a tough place to win consistently and he's respected throughout the league. With Maryland's resources, Rhoades could be in business.

Skinn knows Maryland very well. He was an assistant on Kevin Willard's staff before taking the George Mason gig. He helped Maryland land five-star big fella Derik Queen who turned into the Big Ten Freshman of the Year. Skinn has also crushed it at George Mason with back-to-back 20-win seasons. George Mason shared the regular-season, A-10 championship with VCU and fell just short of a NCAA Tournament appearance. Skinn built one of the elite defenses in college basketball this past season, and his first two George Mason teams have outperformed preseason expectations by a country mile. 

Simpkins played at Maryland from 1992-96 and has serious ties to the DMV. He played at DeMatha, served as an assistant for nearly a decade at George Mason and is now the head coach at American. He led American to the regular-season Patriot League championship and inked a berth in the NCAA Tournament with three wins in a row at the Patriot League Tournament. It was American's first showing in the Big Dance since 2009.

This would be a bit of an audacious hire for Maryland's brass, but Murray is one of the masterminds behind the UConn dynasty. He's highly respected for helping Dan Hurley's offensive playbook turn into one of the hardest covers in college basketball.

Yes, he is Bill Murray's son.

Boston Red Sox designated hitter Rafael Devers is off to a historically poor start to the season. He went 0 for 4 with a walk and three strikeouts on Saturday against the Texas Rangers, extending his hitless streak to 12 at-bats and securing a place for himself in the record books. Indeed, Devers' 10 strikeouts across his first three games establishes a new record for the most in Major League Baseball history, according to SportRadar. Five players had previously tallied nine K's in their first three games.

Devers' struggles notably coincide with his move to designated hitter -- a messy transition that he first rejected before acquiescing to clear room for free-agent signing Alex Bregman. While there is documented history of batters struggling with full-time DH duty, Devers himself has thus far rejected the idea that his woes have anything to do with all the idle time he's gained between at-bats, or with any residual emotions he has from having to walk back his public assertion that he wouldn't DH.

""I think that's in the past,"" Devers told MLB.com after Friday's game. ""That was in spring training. Right now, we're in the season. I'm a DH and I feel like you guys need to change the subject, because that is over and I'm the DH.""

Three games is far too small of a sample to glean anything predictive from the results. The best anyone can hope for is descriptive analysis. With that in mind, Devers has scuffled against a heavy diet of fastballs, which account for 75% of his pitches seen. He's swung at 20 two- and four-seam fastballs, whiffing on 14 of those attempts (or 70%). Devers' bat speed metrics are also down from last season:

2024

72.5 mph

27.9%

2025

69 mph

12.9%

Again, this is all a laughably small sample, so take it for what it's worth: a description of what has occurred over three days, not a prediction of what will occur over the next 159 games.

Devers, 28, will enter Sunday's series finale with a career batting line of .278/.344/.509 (126 OPS+). His contributions have been worth an estimated 22.5 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations. Furthermore, he's a three-time All-Star honoree and a two-time Silver Slugger Award recipient. There's ample reason, then, to believe he'll get things straightened out.

The Red Sox, 1-2 to date, will send Richard Fitts to the mound on Sunday. The Rangers will counter with multi-time Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom.

NEWARK, N.J. — It was the spring of 2021 and Jon Scheyer was on the precipice of a life-changing job opportunity.

But not the way he expected. Not anything close to what he would become.

We know Scheyer now as the head coach of Duke men's basketball. It's hard to see him as anything else; it's sort of crazy how quickly he's made that a true statement.

But around four years ago at this very moment, Scheyer was waiting on two job opportunities, practically convinced one of them — if not both — would go his way.

Scheyer, who is a Chicago native, chased the DePaul job. He interviewed there and loved his chances. But that wasn't the only one he was eying. This has never been publicly revealed until now: Scheyer told CBS Sports he also interviewed at UNLV in 2021. He thought he had a real shot at that one, too. DePaul was intriguing, because of Chicago, but UNLV was the one he and his wife, Marcelle, got really excited about.

He'd been a seven-year assistant at Duke by that point. Helped the program win a national title as a player in 2010 and did it again as one of Mike Krzyzewski's lieutenants on staff in 2015. 

It was time. He thought he was ready. Though still plenty young (in his early 30s), he was desperate to be a head coach.

""It got crazy the last couple weeks,"" Scheyer told CBS Sports about that moment in time. ""I thought I was going to be the coach at DePaul.""

The school hired Tony Stubblefield instead. Shortly thereafter, UNLV also turned him down, hiring Kevin Kruger. Scheyer was deflated. 

Later that spring his life — and Duke's program — changed forever.

""Duke wasn't even an option or a reality then, and to think, you miss out on those, and then two months later, you can't, you can't even fathom it,"" Scheyer said.

He's telling me the story as a piece of white twine tickles his forehead. It's tied around the closure of his 2025 Final Four hat, which Scheyer's wearing backward. He's leaned against the wall in the back hallways of the Prudential Center. Less than 100 paces away, his team waits for him to return to the locker room for one more celebration before leaving this arena — and preparing to go to San Antonio.

At 37, Scheyer has taken Duke to the Final Four and done so in just his third season on the job. His Duke team throttled Alabama 85-65 on Saturday night in the Elite Eight. What was supposed to be a high-level matchup instead turned into a one-sided Duke rout, the latest in a pile of pulverizations this team has delivered over the past four-plus months.

What could have been a terrific East Regional final between the top-seeded Blue Devils and No. 2 Alabama was instead a laugher. Duke took a 15-5 lead on Bama a little more than four minutes into the game. The Crimson Tide missed 18 of their first 25 shots. Duke was never truly threatened. 

A game removed from making an NCAA Tournament-record 25 3-pointers on 51 attempts, Alabama wound up 8-of-32 (25%) from deep. It was playing catchup from the get-go, and in that sense, the game was a bust. The Tide never held a lead and never put together a run. Duke kept Alabama scoreless for more than five minutes in the second half, choking out any hope for a run to make the game interesting.

And so, with a Final Four now official, so is this: We have another Great Duke Team. This one is 35-3 and two wins away from having a claim as one of the best teams in modern history. At KenPom.com, it currently only rates behind the 1998-99 Duke team (that was stunned in the national final against UConn) as the most statistically efficient of the past 28 years. 

When Krzyzewski decided in 2021 that Scheyer should be the one to succeed him in 2022, the decision came as something of a surprise. They'd go for nearly a year to handle the transition. Krzyzewski's farewell tour also received criticism as a result.

""I knew it was going to be hard,"" Scheyer said of being given this job. ""I think it's harder than I could have imagined. I think the most important relationship for me was being really connected with Coach K.""

Truth is, ever since Scheyer got the gig he's made one of the toughest assignments look entry-level in its lack of difficulty. Following a legend is infamously one of the most difficult things to do in sports. Most fail. Some do well enough while still falling plenty short of the standard set by whichever all-time great preceded them.

""Knew he had it, I knew he was special,"" Duke assistant Chris Carrawell told CBS Sports on the court as the team cut down the net. ""He's grown so much this year, so proud of him and what he had to go through. There's a learning curve because you take over for the greatest coach of all time, and it's not easy.""

Scheyer sure makes it look easy, though. The 18th Final Four in Duke history happened with one of the strongest four-game struts ever at this blue blood power. Duke is beating teams in this tournament by an average of 23.5 points.

""X's and O's, he had that from the beginning, but his leadership has taken over,"" Carrawell added. ""It's the hardest thing ever because it's so much pressure. They criticize everything you do, every move you make.""

Even the most optimistic of Duke fans couldn't have expected this. Scheyer has made the complicated seem seamless. He does it with a down-to-earth touch that permeates throughout the program. He's a lot different than Krzyzewski, who burned on a competitive edge that made him legendary — but also not easy to work for. A change in personality was exactly what Duke needed. 

Duke never fell off under Scheyer; now it's two wins away from a sixth national championship. 

""It starts with something that any great relationship has, human to human, person to person, coach to player: a relationship starts with honesty,"" Cooper Flagg told CBS Sports. ""Never hiding anything, telling me what I wanted to hear, but just giving me the truth and nothing but the truth."" 

Scheyer was intentional about this roster and how it needed to be built after suffering a huge letdown in the Elite Eight a season ago. He did not waver on his vision. When other schools with freshmen in prominent roles were losing, Scheyer stuck to his philosophy. There were specific players with specific skillsets he coveted. The staff's list of transfer targets was not long. He brought in guys from Tulane, Purdue and Syracuse — none of them similar, style-wise — to mesh with one of the strongest recruiting classes in Duke history, led by Flagg and flanked by Kon Knueppel and Khaman Maluach.

""That's what drew me to him in the first place,"" Flagg said of Scheyer's communication skills. ""How we built the base of our relationship, and since then, it's just been easy. I wanted him to coach me as hard as he can.""

Said Knueppel: ""Normally, coaches are always kissing your ass. He's always had super-honest and raw conversations."" 

Duke's defense was tremendous Saturday, holding Alabama more than 26 points under its season average going into the night (91.4), the 65 points amounting to the second-fewest the Tide scored this season. All-American Mark Sears, who in his previous time out sank 10 3-pointers and scored 35 points, didn't make his first basket until 2:16 remained in the first half. He finished with six points on 12 shots, a brutal finale to an otherwise tremendous college career.

That's the Duke effect. That's Scheyer's doing. 

""Cooper would run through a brick wall for that man,"" Kelly Flagg, Cooper's mother, told CBS Sports. ""I'm kind of gushing, obviously, but Jon really is the greatest.""

This team is a machine. It has one of the best one-and-done players ever in Flagg, but also a switchable freak in Maluach who, with a 9-foot-8 standing reach, is a carnival of terror everywhere on the floor.  

""What Jon is about is building a relationship that is built on trust and respect,"" Kelly Flagg said. ""Cooper is a kid that wants to play for somebody who he trusts and who he respects, and it's a mutual thing. Jon doesn't berate his players. He doesn't belittle them, but they're playing for him as well. They love him, and they trust him, and they want to play as hard as they can.""

Duke hasn't entirely changed the way it does things, but the shift has been noticeable enough that the modernization in the day-to-day has enabled the program to not fall behind. One example among many to choose from: Scheyer hired Rachel Baker, a former Nike associate who was well-regarded in the recruiting space, to be his general manager. He did this before most other programs made space for such a position. She's been a pillar within the program, just like Carrawell, fellow assistant Emanuel Dildy and many more.

Through it all, Scheyer's focus has always been about the players, to a level most coaches his senior can't keep up with. Scheyer admits to being a notoriously bad sleeper. He is never not available for his team. That devotion pays off with guys who will buy in, almost no questions asked, and reap the rewards like what this team's done.

""He acts like he's a player,"" Knueppel told CBS Sports. ""He really understands us, especially with practicing when our body's maybe not feeling great, he can feel it, he understands that. But also on a level of what it takes to be a player at Duke, and the competitive edge you have to have to be successful. He really embodies that well, and in a way that it's not overbearing and horrible, like some coaches, but he has his own way of doing that and being a super-good dude.""

Scheyer is overseeing a squad that is barely interested in making games competitive. The best compliment I can give this team is it's as loaded and deadly as any that played under Coach K. But this is different. It feels different. Duke has become something else.

""We've had to pivot as a program,"" Scheyer told me. ""The timing of it was really the time where you couldn't do things the same. And so in some ways, it was great timing, and then it made me really be true to who I am, faster.""

He's been aided by befriending fellow coaches in their 30s: Joe Mazzulla with the Celtics, Will Hardy with the Jazz and Marcus Freeman with Notre Dame.  Saturday night was the 89th win of Scheyer's career, tying him with Brad Stevens and Brad Underwood for the most wins to start a career through the first three seasons. It would be at least 90 now if not for the loss to NC State a year ago in the Elite Eight. That one lingered with him. Bothered him. Duke was the better team, but not on that day. It deserved to lose. Would he have a team, built in his image, with his convictions, deserving of atoning? Most of these players weren't with the program a year ago. But they all bought in.

Scheyer called Krzyzewski on Friday afternoon, just to touch base and talk about, well, he didn't want to divulge too much of what the conversation was about. But Scheyer did tell me Krzyzewski told him this: ""Don't take for granted being in the Elite Eight. It's not easy to get there. When you're there, you want to take advantage of it.""

Krzyzewski followed up with a text a couple hours before tip-off on Saturday. 

""That meant a lot. I'm lucky to still have my coach,"" he said of the 78-year-old Krzyzewski. ""That's unique. It wasn't about the game plan. It was about me and him, which was a special thing.""

Knowing what we do now, it's clear Krzyzewski's public succession plan best set up Duke, and Scheyer, to keep the program atop the sport. Seeing Duke throttle Alabama on Saturday night was the last result needed to confirm that the right man, in the right way, was picked for the right job. 

Given the weight of the Duke job, this could have gone poorly with almost anyone else. But unlike his previous job interviews, Scheyer didn't come in second.

DePaul and UNLV have since made other hirings. Scheyer wasn't available the second time around.

No one said Roki Sasaki's transition to Major League Baseball would be easy. In his second big-league start, and his first at Dodger Stadium, Sasaki walked four batters and allowed two runs, failing to get out of the second inning against the Detroit Tigers on Saturday (GameTracker). The Los Angeles Dodgers youngster needed 61 pitches to record five outs. 

Sasaki made his MLB debut earlier this month in his home country, during the two-game Tokyo Series against the Chicago Cubs. He struggled with his control in that game as well, walking five and throwing more balls (31) than strikes (25) in three innings. Through two starts, Sasaki has a league-leading nine walks in 4 2/3 innings.

As was the case in Tokyo, Sasaki consistently missed way off the plate to the armside with his fastball Saturday. That is in on the righties and away from lefties. He also bounced too many splitters out in front of the plate. The pitch location plot tells the story. A lot of these pitches are easy takes for the hitter:

As talented as he is, Sasaki is only 23 years old -- he's slightly older than most college pitchers who will be drafted this July -- and he's adjusting to a new culture on top of all the baseball stuff. Sasaki showed very strong control during his time with the Chiba Lotte Marines in Japan, so the strike-throwing ability is in there. We just haven't seen it yet through two big-league starts.

Sasaki's fastball sat 96.1 mph Saturday, down a bit from the 100 mph gas he pumped during the Tokyo Series earlier this month. That is understandable though. Sasaki surely had plenty of adrenaline while pitching in his home country and during his first MLB start. It's also possible he tried to take a little off Saturday just to get the ball over the plate (even if it didn't work).

Given his top of the rotation talent, we ranked Sasaki as the seventh-best free agent available this past offseason. Here's the write-up:

The short hook: Explosive young righty with durability questions

Sasaki is the most talented pitcher not already in an MLB organization. He's been on the global radar since throwing a 19-strikeout perfect game as a 20-year-old in 2022. He combines elite velocity with a devastating swing-and-miss splitter/forkball. Sasaki has dealt with his share of injuries, limiting him to 33 combined starts across the last two seasons. His earning potential is completely suppressed because of his amateur free agent classification. Nevertheless, a fully actualized Sasaki has a chance to be an immediate impact starter in the majors.

Sasaki joined the Dodgers on a minor-league contract with a $6.5 million signing bonus in January. MLB's international signing rules limited him to a minor-league deal rather than a massive contract on par with Yoshinobu Yamamoto's because he is under 25. The San Diego Padres and Toronto Blue Jays were the two other finalists to sign him.  

The Dodgers have won their first four games this season, which is the best start by a defending World Series champion since the 1985 Tigers started 6-0. Los Angeles has so much talent on the roster that they can let Sasaki work through any growing pains and not sweat the wins and losses too much. Clearly though, the young man has a lot to improve, especially with his command.

The Indiana basketball season came to an end when the Hoosiers were left out of the 2025 NCAA Tournament bracket, the end of the Mike Woodson era. Woodson announced on Feb. 7 that he would step down at the end of the season, giving coaches an opportunity to circle Indiana basketball players as potential targets in the college basketball transfer portal. New head coach Darian DeVries, who was hired following one season with West Virginia, has a clean slate when it comes to the 2025-26 Indiana basketball roster. DeVries has proven he can engineer a quick turnaround, and the transfer portal will play a key role for him in the coming weeks.

The portal window is open for several more weeks and will be one priority along with building the newest Indiana basketball coaching staff. Which players is DeVries looking at in the portal?

Sophomore forward Mackenzie Mgbako and point guard Myles Rice are among the other six players who have entered the portal.

Guard Luke Goode reportedly plans to fight for an extra year of eligibility, but DeVries is otherwise starting with a blank roster. West Virginia transfer Tucker DeVries, who only played in eight games for the Mountaineers before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury, is expected to join his father at Indiana. He averaged 14.9 points per game on 47.3% 3-point shooting in his eight outings, so he would be a nice building block for Indiana's new roster.

The Boston Red Sox are deep in talks about a long-term contract extension with infielder and part-time outfielder Kristian Campbell, reports MassLive.com. Campbell made Boston's Opening Day roster and has spent only a few days in the big leagues. The team has not yet confirmed any agreement. 

Campbell, 22, was a fourth round pick out of Georgia Tech in 2023 and he cannot become a free agent until after the 2030 season. For him, an extension would be about locking in a life-changing payday. For the Red Sox, the extension would give them cost certainty over Campbell's team-control years, and presumably buy out a few free agent years as well.

Here are the largest contracts ever given to players with less than one full year of service time: 

The Carroll extension is most relevant to Campbell. Acuña had already won Rookie of the Year at the time of his extension and Rodríguez had been an All-Star. Franco and Harris both had roughly three months in the big leagues at the time of their deals.  

Carroll, meanwhile, signed his extension with about a month of big-league time, and while being ranked as one of the game's very best prospects, like Campbell was coming into this year. Our R.J. Anderson ranked Campbell as the game's third best prospect this spring. Here's his write-up: 

The short hook: The breakout prospect of the year 	

Campbell  has greatly boosted his stock since being drafted in the fourth round  during summer 2023. He trained his bat speed over the winter, empowering  him to launch 20 home runs last year after smoking only four during his  single season at Georgia Tech. Campbell's added muscle gives him a  well-rounded game: He has a good feel for contact and the zone alike;  he's an above-average runner; and the Red Sox continue to play him at  shortstop, albeit while giving him looks elsewhere on the diamond, too.  Campbell already has the appearance of being a draft-day steal. Expect  him to continue to enhance that perception in 2025, likely while  spending a lot of time in the majors. 	

A year ago at this time Campbell was not ranked among Boston's top 30 prospects. He broke out in a major way last summer, hitting .330/.439/.558 with 32 doubles and 20 home runs at three minor-league levels. Campbell is a natural second baseman, though he played left field Saturday night as the Red Sox look for ways to get everyone in the lineup. 

Last spring the Red Sox locked up Ceddanne Rafaela (eight years, $50 million) and Brayan Bello (six years, $55 million) to long-term extensions early in their careers. In outfielder Roman Anthony and shortstop Marcelo Mayer, Boston has two other elite prospects they could look to extend at some point. Mayer and Campbell are Boston's double-play combination of the future. 

Campbell slugged his first MLB home run Saturday night. He is 5 for 10 with a double, a homer, two walks, and two strikeouts in his first three big-league games.

Duke is heading to the Final Four for the first time under coach Jon Scheyer after beating Alabama 85-65 in the Elite Eight on Saturday. The No. 1 seed Blue Devils put the clamps on the No. 2 seed Crimson Tide's prolific offense while earning their 15th consecutive victory.

Just two days after draining an NCAA Tournament record 25 3-pointers in a Sweet 16 victory over BYU, Alabama hit just 8 of 32 from beyond the arc against the Blue Devils. Duke's size and athleticism gave the Crimson Tide and their smaller contingent of guards fits.

The rim-protecting prowess of 7-foot-2 freshman center Khaman Maluach was particularly impactful for the Blue Devils, who led by at least seven for the second half. Maluach finished with just two blocks, but regularly impacted Alabama's drives to the rim when Duke ran the Crimson Tide off the 3-point line.

With All-American guard Mark Sears struggling, the Crimson Tide could find no consistent source of offense. Sears finished 2 of 12 with six points and five turnovers. Kon Knueppel led Duke with 21 points while Cooper Flagg contributed 16 and Tyrese Proctor finished with 17. Maluach also made a huge impact offensively with 14 points on 6 of 7 shooting.

Duke: most points per game (91.8) and highest field goal percentage (56.2%) through four NCAA Tournament games since 2008 North Carolina

Tyrese Proctor flew under the radar for much of the season as the hype around Duke centered on Cooper Flagg and the rest of the Blue Devils' talented freshman class. But Proctor proved his immense worth yet again Saturday with another huge game. Proctor finished with 17 points on 7 of 10 shooting to continue his recent run of big performances. The only returning starter on the team and only third-year scholarship player on the Duke roster scored 19 in the ACC Tournament title game and averaged 22 points per game during the NCAA Tournament's first weekend. He has elevated his game this season and that was on display again against the Crimson Tide.

Duke has progressed further in the NCAA Tournament each season under third-year coach Jon Scheyer. The 37-year old former Blue Devils star was tasked with replacing the legendary Mike Krzyzewski, and Saturday's win once again validated Duke's faith in him. It was clear immediately the Blue Devils would remain a recruiting power under Scheyer's direction. Less apparent was whether the first-time head coach would be able to unlock that talent in critical moments. Scheyer's schematic aptitude was on display all season, but the Blue Devils were rarely challenged in the ACC. After getting pushed by both Arizona and Alabama in the second weekend of the Big Dance, they rose to the occasion. So much of a college basketball coach's reputation is staked on what they accomplish in March. The job isn't done for Duke, but Scheyer has proven once again that he's a big-time coach.

Alabama will finish the season 2-3 when shooting 25% or worse from 3-point range. While the Crimson Tide's 8 of 32 clip from beyond the arc could be chalked up to a cold shooting performance, credit should also go to Duke. The Blue Devils' length and athleticism bothered Alabama all game and kept the Crimson Tide's guards from getting clean looks. Reserve big man Aidan Sherrell provided a brief lift early in the first half by making his first two 3-pointers. But when he cooled off and Duke center Khaman Maluach was able to safely camp out in the lane, it changed the game's complexion. Maluach's rim protection allowed the Blue Devils to safely blitz Bama's shooters, which kept the Crimson Tide from getting quality shots.

Duke is heading to the Final Four for the first time under coach Jon Scheyer after beating Alabama 85-65 in the Elite Eight on Saturday. The No. 1 seed Blue Devils put the clamps on the No. 2 seed Crimson Tide's prolific offense while earning their 15th consecutive victory.

Kon Knueppel led Duke with 21 points while Cooper Flagg contributed 16 and Tyrese Proctor finished with 17. Maluach also made a huge impact offensively with 14 points on 6 of 7 shooting.

Duke is on the cusp of reaching the Final Four. The Blue Devils have stifled everything the Crimson Tide have tried to do offensively. Alabama is down to 33.9% shooting for the game and 25% for the half. It hasn't been an offensive masterclass from the Blue Devils, but it's hardly mattered because of how dominant they've been on the other end.

Khaman Maluach has 12 points, five rebounds and two blocks. But it's not the counting stats that have made him the most impactful player on the floor in this game. Rather, it's his defensive presence underneath the basket. He continues to alter shots and make the Crimson Tide think twice about attacking the basket. The 7-foot-2 freshman deserves a ton of the credit for why Alabama is shooting just 36.4%.

Alabama had a couple of 3-point looks that could have cut the deficit to just five points. However the Crimson Tide remain cold from deep (7 of 26) at the under-12 media timeout. Duke is off to a slow start offensively in the second half as well, and fouls are beginning to mount for both teams. Something to watch: Cooper Flagg is just 4 of 14 from the field and has made 1 of his past 9 shots.

Alabama's Grant Nelson just came up one with one of the best blocks you'll see in this NCAA Tournament as Cooper Flagg soared toward the basket for a transition dunk attempt. It led to a 3-pointer on the other end from the Crimson Tide, who have come out of the break with some energy. If Alabama is able to rally, bookmark that sequence. A highlight-reel defensive play leading to some major momentum. 

If Alabama is going to make a run in the second half, it will likely need more from Mark Sears. The All-American had four assists in the first half but just two points as he went 1 for 4 from the floor. Duke's size and length on the perimeter is a problem, not just for Sears, but for all of Alabama's smaller guards. As for the Blue Devils, they'd be well-served to hunt for the right look on offense. With so many mismatches against Alabama's undersized backcourt, there's a good look to be found on every trip with a bit of patience.

Duke shot 56.3% in the first half and got 11 points from Kon Knueppel as it established control against an explosive Alabama team. The Crimson Tide hit just 5 of 19 from 3-point range after drilling an NCAA Tournament record 25 from beyond the arc in their Sweet 16 win over BYU. However, Bama remains within striking distance after finding some success with Grant Nelson attacking the basket late in the half.

Alabama has started figuring out how to find Grant Nelson slipping to the basket when Duke attacks the Crimson Tide on the perimeter. But the Blue Devils remain ruthlessly efficient offensively, which is making it tough for the Crimson Tide to make headway. Caleb Foster just hit a big 3-pointer for the Blue Devils to stop a 7-0 Bama run.

Kon Knueppel is taking advantage of Alabama's smaller guards and using his size on the block and in transition to attack the basket. The freshman has a game-high 11 points on 4 of 7 shooting to go with a pair of steals. This is proving to be a rough matchup for the likes of Aden Holloway, Mark Sears and Labaron Philon, each of whom are giving up height and weight against the 6-7 Knueppel.

Alabama star Mark Sears is having some trouble with Duke's defensive length early in this game. The Blue Devils are running Alabama off the 3-point line but recovering well. On a couple of possessions, Sears has found his way into the paint, only to get swallowed up by the defense. He's 0 for 2 with three turnovers.

Aidan Sherrell hit multiple 3-pointers in a game just three times all season entering the Elite Eight. But the 6-10 freshman canned his first two looks from beyond the arc after checking in for Cliff Omoruyi following the first media timeout. If he can draw Duke rim protector Khaman Maluach away from the basket, it could open things up for Alabama. Sherrell is just a 31.6% 3-point shooter for the season. Cooper Flagg has two early turnovers for Duke.

Duke came ready to play. The Blue Devils drilled their first three 3-pointers, with Cooper Flagg leading off the action on the game's opening possession. Tyrese Proctor and Kon Knueppel have also hit 3s in the opening minutes as the Crimson Tide try to find their bearings. Grant Nelson has drawn the assignment of guarding Flagg for Bama, which has committed three quick turnovers.

BYU tried and failed to beat Alabama at its own game. Duke is not going to fall into that trap. The barrage of unguarded 3s that Alabama got to take in the Sweet 16 will not be there against a Duke team that has big guards who can also move laterally extremely well. Duke has allowed double-digit unguarded catch-and-shoot 3s just five times this year. Tyrese Proctor or Sion James are going to be draped on Mark Sears like white on rice from the opening tip.

Full scouting report and pick 👇

Duke forward Maliq Brown played a limited role in the Blue Devils' Sweet 16 win over Alabama as he made his return from a shoulder injury. Here's what coach Jon Scheyer had to say about Brown's situation:

""Yeah, I mean, I think it speaks a lot about who Maliq is and what he's all about. Look, he's not 100 percent. He's not close to it. And ideally he wouldn't have played in last night's game. It was more in an emergency. All of a sudden Khaman got two fouls and Pat got two fouls. I thought he did some really good things in his minutes. We're going to have him ready to go in the next game. He's been a key guy for us all year-round. What he does for us, he doesn't necessarily shoot a lot, so it's about his health and physical readiness, and he just wanted to give it a shot for us, and I think that says a lot. We want to protect him at the same time, and you're balancing when he's fully ready with also the time is running out for the season.

""So that's been a balancing act for me, to be honest. It's been something we've struggled with. But the fact that his mindset is to do whatever to help us win, I think is an incredible thing as a coach to have a guy that thinks that way.""

We rarely get a regional final with two teams this good on offense. Alabama hit 113 points vs. BYU in this building on Thursday; Duke ticked exactly 100 in beating Arizona. The potential for potent offense and powerful performances is palpable from a pair of programs that were ranked high in the preseason (Bama No. 2, Duke No. 7) and have stayed steady for the most part over the past four-plus months.

ROMULUS, Mich. — There is no Nate Oats Gymnasium or Nate Oats Hall of Fame. The school isn't located on Nate Oats Parkway, and the legacy of basketball success at Romulus High School transcends Oats' 11 years as the coach here.

But if you know where to look inside this school located just around the corner from the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, you can see the legacy Oats left behind and the footsteps of his unlikely journey to the Final Four.

Now in his sixth season leading Alabama, Oats is one of the biggest names in college basketball.

Story from last year profiling the rise of a college basketball coaching star

Alabama broke the all-time record for most 3-pointers in an NCAA Tournament game as the No. 2 seed Crimson Tide flew past No. 6 seed BYU in a record-setting 113-88 victory. Bama rang up 25 triples on 51 attempts, led by a 10 of 16 clip from star guard Mark Sears. As CBS Sports' Matt Norlander wrote from the Prudential Center in Newark, the 3-pointers ""came down like meteorites, one after another after another."" The previous record of 21 made 3-pointers set by Loyola Marymount in 1990 stood for 35 years until the Crimson Tide obliterated it with over seven minutes left.

No. 1 seed Duke has so rarely been tested by quality opposition in recent months that it was fair to wonder how the Blue Devils would respond when put in a pressure situation during the NCAA Tournament. But in a 100-93 Sweet 16 win over No. 4 seed Arizona, freshman phenom Cooper Flagg showed everyone why he's considered a lock to be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft. The Wildcats mounted a second-half charge to infuse the Sweet 16 battle with some drama, but Flagg's multi-faceted brilliance won the day. The versatile forward finished with 30 points, seven assists and six rebounds. He also blocked three shots and had a steal while bringing the Blue Devils within one victory of reaching the Final Four.

NEWARK, N.J. -- What's so glorious about sport is how frequently it gives us something that seems so rare, it feels sent from another dimension. As if it could never happen again.

What transpired at the Prudential Center on Thursday night surely applies.

Who knows how long it will take, if ever, for the world to witness something equal to or better than what the second-seeded Alabama Crimson Tide accomplished here. Nate Oats' sniper-minded squad sank an NCAA Tournament-record 25 3-pointers against No. 6 seed BYU en route to a record-setting and program-defining 113-88 win in the East Regional semifinals. 

NEWARK, N.J. — What spectacle this city took in Thursday night, a pair of regional-semifinal rarities that boosted the ""wow"" factor of a 2025 bracket owned by the big boys.

In absence of Cinderella, give us the scintillating.

In the early tip, Alabama put on one of the best offensive outputs this glorious NCAA Tournament has ever staged, with 25 3-pointers on 51 attempts and 113 points against BYU. The singed nets took on even more heat in the nightcap: Duke vs. Arizona. Cooper Flagg and Caleb Love. The matchup meant either Flagg (a freshman) or Love (a fifth-year senior) would walk off the floor for the final time as a college player.

The Iowa State basketball season came to a disappointing conclusion when the Cyclones were bounced by Ole Miss in the second round of the NCAA Tournament bracket.

The West Virginia basketball team went through a whirlwind at the end of the season, starting with a surprise absence from the 2025 NCAA Tournament bracket. Head coach Darian DeVries then left the school to take the opening at Indiana, leaving a vacancy at the helm. They moved swiftly and hired Ross Hodge from North Texas as their new head coach following his 27-win season that ended with a second-place finish in the AAC behind Memphis. Hodge is a defensive-minded coach who helped now-Texas Tech head coach Grant McCasland build an elite defensive program at North Texas.

Hodge's staff at West Virginia has been largely the same in his two seasons as a Division I coach, and they could all be viable options to join their boss on the West Virginia coaching staff. Regardless of who joins Hodge, their priority will be crafting a new West Virginia basketball roster with the college basketball transfer portal.

Five players have already made that decision, including leading scorer Javon Small. Three recruits also requested to exit their National Letters of Intent, leaving six scholarship players that are expected to return next year.

Junior forward Brenen Lorient averaged 11.9 points and 4.9 rebounds off the bench for North Texas this season, making him an intriguing candidate to follow Hodge to Morgantown. Junior forward Grant Newell started all 35 games and could provide some immediate experience for West Virginia's new roster.

INDIANAPOLIS – It was the biggest pass of Joseph Tugler's life. In the end, it might be the biggest pass in Houston's basketball history.

""Instinctively instinctive,"" Cougars coach Kelvin Sampson called it. 

""Total improvisation,"" Houston assistant Kellen Sampson said. 

""I can't stop watching it, over and over again,"" Tugler's sister Elexar told CBS Sports.

No. 1 seed Houston is here in Sunday's Midwest Regional Final against No. 2 seed Tennessee largely because of Tugler. In case you weren't up in the early morning hours Saturday, the Cougars advanced to the Elite Eight over Purdue because of a game-winning basket by Milos Uzan with 0.9 seconds left.

But it was Tugler's pass that had the basketball cognoscente buzzing. With the game tied at 60, Uzan started by taking the ball out of bounds underneath Houston's basket with 1.8 seconds remaining. Leading scorer L.J. Cryer was covered, so the 6-foot-8, 230-pound Tugler sprinted down the lane to meet Uzan's pass. 

In an instant, Tugler caught the ball before immediately throwing a bounce pass for Uzan that was brilliant in its simplicity. A play had been drawn up. But it was Tugler's thinking in the moment that made it work.  

An incredible “chess match” on final play of @BoilerBall @UHCougarMBK game. The Cougars have a pet “late clock” play, but Purdue smells it out. Boilers' Smith reacts to help teammate but gives up protecting hoop. @CoachSampsonUH adjusted to the adjustment. pic.twitter.com/jIMN9V9U8t

So did his background. The play was those in-the-moment, no-think, all-instinct plays that are refined only when no one is looking. 

""He's the one guy on our team that's played on outdoor courts more than anybody,"" Kellen Sampson added. ""Just a hooper … Jo has played more against … chained nets, double rims than anybody on our team."" 

Until the eighth grade, Tugler had grown up in Monroe, Louisiana, and was brother to a pair of twin sisters nine years older than him. If they weren't dragging him to a gym to play against  ""older men"" according to Elexar, the kid they called ""JoJo"" was playing with and against his sisters' teams. Both Elexar and Alexar, now 33, played at Louisiana-Monroe. 

Their mother, Brenda or ""Miss B,"" still holds the blocked shots record at Southern. 

""Kudos to Jo in that in the end his instincts took over,"" Kellen Sampson said. ""There are some guys that are paying $100 an hour [for a personal trainer] and learning some of those things. Jo learned it 100 hours playing under the blazing Louisiana sun.""

This is the time of year the unexpected make seasons, heroes and tournaments. One Shining Moment and all that. One simple pass has changed Tugler's life. His phone has blown up. Suddenly a sophomore role player averaging 5.5 points was talking about more than his broken right foot suffered more than a year ago. 

""I'm loving every moment of this right now,"" Tugler said Saturday afternoon. ""I ain't never been to none of this."" 

It's happening all over the bracket. Michigan State's Tom Izzo is one game away from his first Final Four in six years at age 70.  Cooper Flagg is trying to win it all in his one-and-done year at Duke. 

In Sunday's game here, Kelvin Sampson and Tennessee's Rick Barnes renew a friendship that goes back 40 years. But those guys are stars, familiar names. 

This is survival at a base level. 

""To go on a great run you've gotta survive one game where maybe the bullet, it doesn't fire right,"" Kellen Sampson said. 

That moment was Friday night for Houston. 

The Tugler family moved to Houston about six years ago. The brother was an ungainly teenager growing into his body. 

""We did [know he was going to be this good],""  Elexar said. ""It runs in our blood. He was tall for his age and he played against grown men. On the playground, on the court, we took him everywhere.""

Kellen Sampson saw Tugler while scouting another player at a high school event. Somehow a kid on the B-team of the AAU Houston Defenders 16-and-under team made an impact.

""Jo ended up making four or five plays,"" Sampson said. ""At the time he was 6-5 ½, 6-6. He was everywhere…

""It's just his motor. His game is a shotgun blast. It still is. But so is our game. His long arms are ridiculous. When he came for one of his unofficial visits. We measured his wingspan. Our [jaws] dropped -- 7-6."" 

Houston eventually beat out TCU, Kansas State, SMU and Louisiana Tech for Tugler. That makes Tugler a bargain in anyone's recruiting evaluation. 

""In that moment it's magnified,"" Cryer said. ""He always makes little plays like, 'Dang, coach didn't draw it up, but he just does it on his own. It was just one of the moments. This time it was the biggest one."" 

As only Kelvin Sampson can do, he used Tugler's name in the same sentence as Chris Paul.

""I wouldn't compare JoJo's IQ with Chris Paul's. I would compare his instincts,"" he said. 

There's that I-word again. The kid, the play and the tournament, sometimes, is hard to quantify. As for Tugler's sudden celebrity, more than attention awaits if Houston can win out. He is part of a Cougars' crew that already is well compensated. 

""Our kids do well in NIL,"" Sampson volunteered. ""It hasn't changed our kids.""

Barnes was asked about an era when high-profile coaches in both football and basketball have retired rather than right the rising tide of professionalism. 

""I never did [think about retiring] because I've got a group of guys I thoroughly enjoy being around every day … There are days they probably don't like me very well,"" Barnes said. ""Some days I don't like them either.""

All five Tennessee players on the dais Saturday smiled. 

Both coaches are from North Carolina. Both have played and coached against each other in their youth and in their golden years. Sampson is 69. Barnes is 70. Both are among the leaders of coaches with the most wins among active coaches. 

""Rick is one of my favorite people in the world…,"" Sampson said. ""He is a jewel among jewels.""

""I love Kelvin Sampson,"" Barnes said. ""He will be a friend of mine until the day I die.""

On Sunday afternoon they will be after each other's throats. Barnes' 800-pound gorilla is that Tennessee has never been to a Final Four. Sampson has been to two Final Fours in his career. He has the team – perhaps his best at Houston – to finally win a national championship. 

""If we don't win it, I hope he does,"" Barnes said. 

The pair coached against each other for eight intense years when they were at Oklahoma (Sampson) and Texas (Barnes) and Big 12 foes. They never let a fierce rivalry get in the way of their friendship. 

Sampson told of a golf fundraiser prior to the Texas-Oklahoma football game with the basketball coaches as honorary captains. The players had to hit from where the coaches' balls landed off the tee. Barnes went into the woods, Sampson recalled. Sampson sliced one into the water.

""You know what that tells you?"" Houston's coach asked. ""How good basketball coaches we are because neither one of us can golf.""

It did not Kristian Campbell long to make an impact for the Boston Red Sox. He won a roster spot in spring training and clubbed his first career home run Saturday night against the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Field (GameTracker). Right-hander Jacob Webb left a 92.5 mph fastball in the middle of the plate, and Campbell deposited it into the bullpen.

Here is Campbell's first career big league homer. It left his bat at a healthy 112.2 mph:

431 FT and 112.2 MPH off the bat 🔥Kristian Campbell sent this ball packing for his first career home run! pic.twitter.com/1uPvvamJjC

Campbell, 22, was a fourth-round pick out of Georgia Tech in 2023. He hit .330/.439/.558 with 32 doubles and 20 home runs at three minor league levels last summer, and rocketed up prospect lists. Our R.J. Anderson ranked Campbell the third-best prospect in baseball entering 2025. Here's his write-up:

The short hook: The breakout prospect of the year

Campbell  has greatly boosted his stock since being drafted in the fourth round  during summer 2023. He trained his bat speed over the winter, empowering  him to launch 20 home runs last year after smoking only four during his  single season at Georgia Tech. Campbell's added muscle gives him a  well-rounded game: He has a good feel for contact and the zone alike;  he's an above-average runner; and the Red Sox continue to play him at  shortstop, albeit while giving him looks elsewhere on the diamond, too.  Campbell already has the appearance of being a draft-day steal. Expect  him to continue to enhance that perception in 2025, likely while  spending a lot of time in the majors. 

Despite ranking as the third-best prospect in baseball, Campbell is only the Red Sox's second-best prospect, behind outfielder Roman Anthony. Anthony, 21 in May, is the consensus top prospect and likely to make his MLB debut later this season. Boston also has another top-10 prospect in shortstop Marcelo Mayer. He's likely to debut later this season as well.

Campbell went 3 for 7 with a walk in the first three games of the season. He is playing left field Saturday but is a natural second baseman. His presence at second base is one reason the Red Sox did not follow through with a plan to put Alex Bregman at second and keep Rafael Devers at third. Bregman is staying at third and Devers is now the team's DH.

At 4-0, the Los Angeles Dodgers are off to the best start by a defending World Series champion since the Detroit Tigers won their first six games in 1985. The Dodgers have done that without having Shohei Ohtani the pitcher. Ohtani the hitter is 6 for 16 (.375) with a double and two home runs through four games.

Ohtani the pitcher is working his way back from his September 2023 elbow surgery. On Saturday, he returned to the mound and threw his first bullpen session since Feb. 25. Ohtani hit pause on his mound work in spring training to focus on his preparation as a hitter, but now that the regular season is underway, he's resumed working on his pitching.

Shohei Ohtani threw his first bullpen session in almost a month, attended by Dodgers GM Brandon Gomes and manager Dave Roberts.@SportingTrib | #Dodgers pic.twitter.com/HX0qwu97mv

Ohtani is still fairly early in his throwing progression and his return to game action is not imminent. Generally speaking, it's a six-week progression from throwing bullpens to facing hitters to pitching in rehab games to pitching in major league games. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts confirmed Ohtani's return to the mound in a game is still ""a ways away.""

""It's gonna be a while,"" Roberts said Saturday, adding he believed Ohtani was scheduled to throw 25-30 pitches in the bullpen. ""I think you start with the natural progression of a bullpen, then you've kinda gotta mix in different pitches, to then face hitters again. It's a start up again. I don't have a timeline, I don't think anyone does, but we're a ways away.""

The Dodgers are understandably being cautious with Ohtani's rehab. They don't want to risk a setback that not only delays his return to the mound, but also causes him to miss time as a hitter. The Dodgers have nine more years and close to $700 million invested in Ohtani -- they want him back pitching in games, for sure, but the big picture is the priority.

Ohtani is hardly the only Dodgers pitcher rehabbing an injury and currently unable to pitch in games. Here is the team's rotation depth chart:

Knack, Miller, and Wrobleski would slot into the starting rotation for more than a few teams around the league. For the Dodgers, they are depth guys who can provide innings while Gonsolin, Kershaw, and Ohtani work their way back to full health.

In 2023, the last time he pitched, Ohtani threw 132 innings with a 3.14 ERA and 167 strikeouts. On a per-inning basis, Ohtani was as good as just about any pitcher in the game from 2021-23. He is also one of the best hitters in the world. Last season he became the first 50/50 player in history en route to winning his third MVP award.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Anbcsports.com","Haiden Deegan, Julien Beaumer exchange words about competition and Deegan arrest following Seattle race","https://www.nbcsports.com/motor-sports/news/haiden-deegan-and-julien-beaumer-exchange-words-after-seattle-race","Sun, 30 Mar 2025 04:52:30 GMT","

Haiden Deegan and Julien Beaumer had a heated exchange after the Monster Energy Supercross 250 West divisional race, which led to a battle of words on from the podium stage.

At the center of the controversy were actions following Deegan's March 21, 2025, Walton County, Florida, arrest for stunt driving and street racing.

Deegan fell early while riding second to his teammate Cole Davies, who won the race. Deegan fell as far back as eighth and climbed through the field before catching Beaumer in a contest for third on Lap 18. Deegan rode Beaumer wide, turning into his competitor, before taking the position. Beaumer kept his bike upright and finished fourth.

The two riders parked next to one another following the main event. At one point, Deegan slapped Beaumer's helmet.

“It definitely gets a little rowdy, but obviously we were boys being boys,” Deegan said in the post-race news conference when asked about the altercation. “He grabbed my helmet first and I was like, ‘Hey, don't touch me,' but it is what it is. It's racing. Someone said he's going to get payback or whatever. We'll see.”

Deegan was unhappy about a post on Beaumer's Instagram page last week.

“Everyone knows what happened to me these last two weeks,” Deegan said after finishing third, referencing his Florida arrest. “He, JuJu went out of his own hands to post on his story that had my address and stuff. And now you're talking about my family, putting my family in danger and that's a whole ‘nother scene so I just told him, ‘Don't do that, Dude. It ain't cool,' and he obviously lit back but we'll see what happens from here on out.”

Walton County's booking information included Deegan's address. 

Following his arrest, Deegan posted a screenshot in an Instagram story of his booking information, which had his address erased. Beaumer posted the unaltered version in an Instagram story, which both disappeared in 24 hours. 

“To that situation, no worries,” Beaumer said after finishing fourth, referencing the altercation with Deegan. “I ain't the only one who posted his address. So he can talk all he wants, but that's public record. I'm not worried about it; he's got one coming for him in Philly.”

The title of Jason Statham's latest movie, A Working Man, is very appropriate because he's the working man's action hero.

Since Statham's breakout role in The Transporter, he's worked steadily in Hollywood with a lot of action credits to his name.

The Transporter is arguably one of Statham's best movies, and it shares some themes in common with A Working Man's anti-human trafficking plot. But like several of Statham's top films — including Crank and Wrath of Man — The Transporter isn't readily available on a mainstream streamer.

That made it a challenge for What to Watch to put together this list of three Jason Statham action movies to watch if you liked A Working Man. But these films will give you the action fix that you need.





Transporter 3 may not be as amazing as the original film in the franchise, but it's a joy to watch Statham playing Frank Martin one more time. Although Frank is largely retired from being the underworld's No. 1 getaway driver, he's forced back into action by a corrupt executive, Jonas Johnson (Prison Break's Robert Knepper).

To ensure Frank's cooperation, he and a hostage, Valentina Tomilenko (Natalya Rudakova), are forced to wear bracelets that will explode and kill them if they move too far away from the car. But if Johnson thinks that's enough to keep Frank in line, then he's in for a very rude awakening.

Transporter 3 is streaming on Tubi.



Safe features Statham at his most vulnerable as his character, Luke Wright, wrestles with suicidal despair after the loss of his wife and unborn child. Luke made the mistake of winning a fixed MMA fight, and the Russian mafia punished him by killing everyone he knew and loved. That leaves Luke homeless and contemplating the end of his life.

Luke finds his chance for redemption when he stumbles upon the attempted kidnapping of Mei (Catherine Chan), a young Chinese girl who is used by criminals as a living calculator. Mei's a mathematical genius, and the Russian mob wants the number that she has memorized. By keeping Mei out of the wrong hands, Luke may even be able to get his revenge on the men who murdered his family.

Safe is streaming on Prime Video.

Statham also plays a down-on-his-luck character in Wild Card. The improbably named Nick Wild (Statham) has a severe gambling addiction, which he fuels by offering out his services as a bodyguard. But as a favor to his friend Holly (Dominik Garcia-Lorido), Nick agrees to confront the man who sexually assaulted her, Danny DeMarco (Milo Ventimiglia), and secure her restitution.

DeMarco is connected in the criminal underworld, and he won't let Nick's actions go unanswered. That comes back to haunt Nick when he's escorting a young man, Cyrus Kinnick (Michael Angarano), on a personal tour of Las Vegas' high-rolling casinos.

Jack Falahee explained why he and Conrad Ricamora needed “a break” after playing onscreen love interests on How to Get Away With Murder — and how that experience paved the way for a lifelong friendship.

“He's a rock star and one of the loves of my life,” Falahee, 36, exclusively told Us Weekly while promoting his guest spot on Grosse Pointe Garden Society. “It was bizarre. We needed a break after the show wrapped — and it was a very intense union with the two of us on screen.”

Falahee and Ricamora, 46, have since found a new normal. “It took us a second, and then I flew out to New York to see him. I was so grateful that we had taken the break,” he told Us. “Because I think it gave us the runway to now have this really, really beautiful friendship.”

While reflecting on the challenges he faced after an on-set injury, Falahee recalled Ricamora's support, adding, “He's another person that has just been an incredible shoulder to lean on. I would kill for the opportunity to work with him again. But he's busy being a Broadway star. I mean, have you seen Oh, Mary!? He's absolutely sensational.”



Falahee added: “I will fly literally around the world to see him on stage. And if anyone has the opportunity to, they should as well.”

The former costars won Us over as Connor and Oliver on ABC's How to Get Away With Murder. During the show's run from 2014 to 2020, the fictional couple faced many ups and downs. Off screen, however, the How to Get Away With Murder cast remained close even after moving on to new projects.

“We stopped filming shortly before the COVID pandemic. So especially in those early days, we were really relying on each other since we became a family,” Falahee told Us. “We were sort of a support group for one another through that really difficult time for the world at large.”

The actor called the experience “a light in the darkness,” adding, “To have the final season of the show be airing and for us to be on our group chat and sharing memories with one another. It's not often in our industry that you do get to work with people again. … I definitely subscribe in this line of work that I know it is unlikely that I'll get to work with people again — but I desperately hope to.”

After taking a break from acting due to an injury, Falahee is back and better than ever with a guest spot on his HTGAWM costar Aja Naomi King's show.

“It was really nice. To be honest, I have had some very lean years. It's been really tough in the industry and coming out of the pandemic and into the strike. Then last year, I was on a film and I ruptured my Achilles [tendon] — and that took me out for the entire year,” he revealed. “At the end of last year, I was recovering from surgery and really down. I was having a really tough time and I just reached out to a couple of friends that I knew were working and asked for help. I asked if they would keep an eye out for anything that might be right for me.”

Falahee immediately felt the support from King, 40.

“[She] called me and was like, ‘There's a really fun little arc on my show, and all the scenes would be with me.' That's just a testament to who she is as a person. She could tell that I was having a tough time,” he recalled. “And I stayed with her and her [husband] Dan [King] and their son while we were filming. There was a snowstorm in Atlanta, and it hadn't snowed in 13 years so production got shut down.”

Falahee continued: “It was just so nice to be living with them and not only get to observe how much she's grown as an actress and a leader on set — but also as a partner and a mother. It was nice to be inside of their world for a little bit. … It was a very therapeutic moment in my life and started this year on a really positive note for me. So I'm just eternally grateful.”

Grosse Pointe Garden Society airs on NBC Sundays at 10 p.m. ET, and new episodes are available to stream on Peacock the next day.

Hollywood is grappling with a wave of heartbreak as fans and celebrities mourn the death of beloved stars. Leah Remini is honoring the life of her close friend and collaborator Mike Rinder, who passed away after a battle with cancer. Tragedy also struck with the shocking death of Michelle Trachtenberg at age 39, leaving friends and former costars devastated as they paid touching tributes to her intelligence and vibrant presence.

The Real Reason Why Morgan Wallen Abruptly Exited 'Saturday Night Live' Stage

Prince Harry reportedly lost a venue for the charity he recently resigned from, Sentebale.

The 40-year-old royal lost out the venue for the African charity because he wanted to bring a Netflix camera crew along with him, the chairperson of the charity has claimed in a new interview.

In an interview with the UK's Sky News, Dr. Sophie Chandauka said that an opportunity for Sentebale to do a charity Polo Challenge in Miami was ruined when Harry made the request to bring his Netflix camera crew along.

Keep reading to find out more…

“About a month before the event was about to take place, Prince Harry called the team and said, ‘I'm doing a Netflix show, and I would love to bring a camera crew so that I can include some footage in this show,'” she said. 

“And so the team called me and told me, ‘Oh, Prince Harry's made this request, so we're doing the things.'

“I said, ‘You can't be doing the things without seeking consent from the property owners, the sponsors, all the guests. Nobody signed up to being on a Netflix show,'” she called, adding: “We come up with draft agreements and of course, the venue owner says this is now a commercial undertaking. So here are my terms. We couldn't afford it. So now we lost the venue.”

Harry was able to come up with another venue for the event in April 2024.

“We're excited about it. We would have been really excited had we known ahead of time, but we didn't,” Dr. Chandauka said. 

“And so the choreography went badly on stage because we had too many people on stage. The international press captured this, and there was a lot of talk about the Duchess and the choreography on stage and whether she should have been there and her treatment of me,” she continued.

“Prince Harry asked me to issue some sort of a statement in support of the Duchess, and I said I wouldn't. Not because I didn't care about the Duchess, but because I knew what would happen if I did so, number one. And number two, because we cannot be an extension of the Sussexes.”

Harry and his co-founder quit the charity last week, issuing a statement slamming the operations of Dr. Chandauka and her colleagues. She remains in position, and said the statement was “a damaging piece of news to the outside world without informing me or my country directors' was an ‘attack' and ‘an example of harassment and bullying at scale.”

A source close to the former trustees described the claims as “completely baseless.”

Both parties released statements at the same time about Harry stepping down from the charity. Read them here.","{'href': 'https://www.justjared.com', 'title': 'Just Jared'}"

Morgan Wallen is making headlines after a sudden exit.

The 31-year-old country star suddenly walked off stage in the middle of the end of Saturday Night Live on Saturday (March 29), in which he appeared as musical guest.

During the moment, he seemingly says something to host Mikey Madison before giving her a one-armed hug and heading for the exit as the rest of the cast stayed on stage, as is customary for every episode during the ending credits roll. 

Viewers felt that something was off, especially as castmates Ego Nwodim and Kenan Thompson looked confused by his exit.

Keep reading to find out more...

Later in the night, Morgan posted on his Instagram Story a photo of a private jet and wrote, ""Get me to God's country.""

However, a source close to Morgan says his walking off stage was an accident.

""We're told he entered and exited the studio the same way he did Saturday night during rehearsal and camera blocking all week leading up to the live show...so he routinely headed that way when he thought it was time to go,"" TMZ reported on Sunday (March 30).

If you'll recall, this isn't the only controversy involving SNL and Morgan: in October 2020, he was disinvited as the musical guest after he was caught partying it up in Alabama with no mask amid COVID-19 protocols. He ended up on the show two months later.

Find out what else happened during the episode.

“Piper, nooooo,” she said while imitating Parker. As she got carried away by a bailiff, she yelled out Lorazepam, which is a sedative medication that Victoria was taking in the first few episodes before her husband took her bottle for himself.

“Our beloved Richard is with the angels now,” his former longtime partner Martin Rabbett said in a statement. 

“He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us. How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul. Love never dies. And our love is under his wings lifting him to his next great adventure.”

Richard starred in dozens of productions, including Petulia, Three Musketeers films, King Solomon's Mines and Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold.

He would also be known for his roles in miniseries like Centennial, and he was the first actor to portray Jason Bourne when he starred as the character in an ABC miniseries in 1988.

In his 2003 autobiography Shattered Love, he came out as gay. 

He also starred in 1980′s Shogun, earning a best actor Golden Globe and Emmy nomination, and for The Thorn Birds, he took home another Golden Globe for best actor in a miniseries or motion picture for TV.

More recently, he guest-starred on Nip/Tuck, Brothers & Sisters, The Drew Carey Show and the Twin Peaks reboot. He was the first person ever interviewed on Entertainment Tonight!

He was a singer too, and his “These Stars Will Shine Tonight,” the theme from Dr. Kildaire, reached No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1962.

Our thoughts are with Richard Chamberlain‘s loved ones at this incredibly difficult time. RIP. We have sadly lost several stars in 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.justjared.com', 'title': 'Just Jared'}"

Dave Navarro and Vanessa DuBasso are married!

The 57-year-old Jane's Addiction guitar player and the 32-year-old actress tied the knot in a castle on Saturday (March 29) in Stranraer, Scotland.

According to People, the couple always dreamed of getting married in a castle and once they saw photos of Dunskey Estate, they were immediately captivated!

""It exudes a moody, ethereal charm. Surrounded by a towering forest, a serene lake and the ruins of a castle along the shoreline, it felt like stepping into a fairytale,"" Vanessa told the outlet. 

""We wanted our wedding to feel like a dream,"" Dave added. ""It was important to us to find a place that felt unlike anywhere we had ever been, a place that embraced nature and transported us to another world. We wanted our loved ones to share in this intimate experience.""

Dave and Vanessa exchanged their vows at a forest ceremony with a series of gold candelabra at the altar. The aisle was lined with white roses and chandeliers hung from the trees. Ali Orr Ewing, the owner of the estate, was their officiant.

She also wore a pair of Versace heels and a pair of angel wings, a nod to Dave calling her his ""breathing cherub.""

For their ceremony, a three-piece quartet performed classical music, with Vanessa walking down the aisle to Debussy's ""Clair de Lune."" After their marital kiss, they both walked down the aisle to ""Spring 1"" from Recomposed by Max Richter: Vivaldi – The Four Seasons as fireworks lit up the sky!

Among the guests were Pete Davidson, and they ate a dinner of pasta, filet mignon and seafood, plus an array of Scottish desserts. The cake featured ""a classic domed confection consisting of layers of sponge, raspberry jam, vanilla custard and whipped cream and topped with a marzipan overlay.""

Afterwards, the guests danced the night away in the castle's dungeon, with pizza as ""a cozy, late-night snack.""

“You discover that you get what you get, and for me, I went and found stuff,” she explained.

“I wanted to know what people were not gonna do. Things that they had greenlit and then said, ‘No, we're not gonna do [it] 'cause the person dropped out.' ”

“So that's how I got Jumpin' Jack Flash, ‘cause Shelley Long wasn't gonna do it,” she revealed.

Rob Lowe has received aging advice from two men in his life, one being Clint Eastwood, as he continues to take on his 60s.

While speaking with Aarp, Lowe explained that an unnamed 70-year-old ""idol"" of his had advised him to ""dial it down"" as he gets older. In typical Lowe fashion, he decided to ""dial it up"" instead.

This mentality led him to become seriously injured over the holidays.

Lowe told the outlet that he had been surfing in Hawaii over Christmas and had fallen on a wave that he had ""no business"" being on. He separated a rib during the fall, and it still hasn't healed.

Even after the injury, Lowe decided to continue to live by the motto that another person – Eastwood – told him: ""Never let the old man in.""

Read On The Fox News App

In August, Lowe talked to Howard Stern on his show about his philosophy on aging.

""I've been trying to be the best I can be since I was eight years old,"" he said on the ""Howard Stern Show.""

""It's not just physical. People always say, ‘What does it mean to be youthful and all of that?' And honestly, I get the sense that you know this: It's an inside job.

""Like, think about what's youthful: Youthful are kids, and what are kids? They're curious, they're enthusiastic, they're active, they're interested, they're interesting, and they're not checked-out. As we get older, those are harder and harder and harder for us to do,"" Lowe said.

""So you don't have those qualities, it doesn't make a f–king difference if you've got a great-looking face and a 32-inch waist; no one's going to say you're youthful,"" he concluded.

Ahead of his 60th birthday in March 2024, Lowe told ""The Healthy by Readers Digest"" what he was most looking forward to in the next decade.

""I remember 40, I remember 50, and going into 60 feels exactly like that did early on. You're like, Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. And then as you get closer, I'm psyched.

""Each year we get, we're lucky. A lot of people don't get [birthdays], and I feel like I'm the best version of myself that I've ever been,"" Lowe told the outlet at the time. ""I felt that way at 40 and 50. If one keeps exploring and pushing and challenging themselves and staying interested and interesting, then age really is nothing but a number.""

Now, Lowe is looking forward to welcoming some grandchildren.

The actor and his wife, Sheryl Berkoff, share two sons: Matthew, 32, and John Owen, 29.

He's even spent some time deciding what his future grandkids will call him.

During his interview with AARP, he suggested readers call into his podcast, ""Literally! With Rob Lowe,"" of some possible grandfatherly names.

""I have a probably overly inappropriate interest in my sons' love lives—because I'm angling for grandkids. It better happen!"" Lowe told AARP.

LOS ANGELES — USC began laying the groundwork for its 2025 season when it opened spring practice on Tuesday. The Trojans have three practices in the books. Here's what we've learned.

1. Five-star freshman quarterback Husan Longstreet is the highest-rated newcomer on the roster this spring. Jayden Maiava started four games in Lincoln Riley's offense late last season and has another season's worth of starting experience at UNLV. That makes him the clear favorite to be the opening-day starter for USC.

But Longstreet has the potential to be the long-term answer for Riley and the Trojans, so he will be a major storyline moving forward.

Riley noted that Longstreet had the benefit of practicing with the team during bowl prep, so Tuesday wasn't his first college practice. And Longstreet attended meetings and practices before he signed, so he was about as prepared as a true freshman could be for his first day of spring ball.

“It's paid off because he's way further ahead than most guys would be at this age,” Riley said. “His ability to communicate and manage the group right now as a young guy is pretty impressive.”

I don't take Riley's words to mean that there is a quarterback competition, but I do find it interesting comparing his thoughts on Longstreet with how he spoke about Malachi Nelson — the other five-star QB he signed at USC — a few years ago.

Of course, Nelson was limited by a shoulder injury when he arrived as an early enrollee, but it felt like Riley always spoke about the progress that Nelson needed to make. Nelson lasted just one year at USC. It's still only a few practices in, but Riley's tone when speaking about Longstreet is quite different.

2. The other ballyhooed addition for USC this past recruiting cycle was four-star defensive lineman Jahkeem Stewart, who was arguably the most significant recruiting win of Riley's tenure in Los Angeles.

USC has a lot of good players on its roster. However, the Trojans need more high-ceiling talent, especially along the defensive front, and the 6-foot-5, 290-pound Stewart is just that.

Stewart is listed as a defensive end, but has the size and athleticism to line up pretty much anywhere on the D-line.

“Physically, there's no doubt he's going to have an opportunity to help,” Riley said. “It'll just be about his progress out here (on the practice field).”

Riley pointed out a few things that will determine how much Stewart contributes early on — how he picks up the playbook and how he adjusts to facing college offensive linemen. The latter will be particularly important, considering Stewart didn't play a ton of varsity football due to transfer rules in Louisiana and the fact that he reclassified and should now be in the second semester of his junior year.

Stewart arrived at USC with plenty of hype. The program likely had to invest a lot in him on the NIL front. But there have been positive reviews of how he's carried himself early on.

“He's a cool person. He works. He knows the goal,” sophomore defensive end Kameryn Fountain said. “He (knew) what it (was) when he got here. He came to work, good person, stayed humble.”

Junior defensive end Braylan Shelby said: “(He's) physical, really locked in. I like where his headspace is at. I like where he's developing and growing. He's going to be a star. Y'all are going to see soon, though.”

3. Shelby and Fountain are two promising defensive ends and were both top-100 prospects in their respective recruiting cycles.

Shelby was asked what he's worked on this offseason. “That pass rush,” he said. “We need to get home way more this season. Been practicing a lot of different pass-rush moves.”

The Trojans finished with a meager 21 sacks last season, which ranked 92nd nationally. While USC did have some intriguing talent on the defensive line, it lacked a true, proven pass rusher.

That was made abundantly clear whenever the defense took the field late in games needing a stop to seal the win but couldn't get off the field because it didn't have someone who could truly disrupt an offense up front.

Shelby, Fountain and Lucas have combined for seven career sacks. If USC's defense is going to take a step forward this season, it needs its pass rushers to make a significant leap.

4. Despite their need for playmakers on the defensive front, the Trojans are not expected to pursue Stanford edge rusher David Bailey out of the transfer portal, according to a source briefed on the matter.

Bailey had 14.5 sacks, 22.5 tackles for loss and seven forced fumbles in his three seasons with the Cardinal. His play was one of the few bright spots on an otherwise awful Stanford defense.

Bailey's recruiting decision out of Mater Dei came down to Stanford and USC in December 2021. Shortly after he was hired, Riley made a push and got Bailey, whose sister attended USC, to campus. But Stanford won out.

Bailey will be one of the most sought-after players in the upcoming transfer cycle, but USC — for now — is not expected to be in the mix.

5. Some other news regarding USC's defensive line: Lucas is still not a full practice participant after he missed the second half of last season with a lower leg injury, which required surgery in October.

Riley said that it's possible Lucas will be able to practice this spring, but the staff is going to take it slow with its starting defensive end.

“Certainly won't get into full contact, full speed,” Riley said. “We're being smart with it.”

Kentucky transfer Keeshawn Silver is also not full-go at practice yet. The 6-4, 331-pound Silver was a significant addition this winter and figures to plug the middle of USC's defense. Riley acknowledged that the staff knew Silver required a “little cleanup” on his knee when he transferred. But as far as when Silver will be a full practice participant, Riley said, “We'll see.”

6. Maiava is going to be under major scrutiny this season. That comes with the territory for any USC starting quarterback, but it's also because Maiava was so inconsistent during his four starts to end last season.

Which Maiava will show up down-to-down is a big question. But this is his second year in Riley's offense, which should benefit him. And he'll start this spring with the knowledge that he's in the lead in the starting quarterback race. Consistent first-team reps should also help.

Riley has noticed the redshirt junior is more confident as a player, in the offense and in his relationships with his teammates.

“That's what we're going to need him to be,” Riley said.

“I came in last year and was a little, kind of lost in some ways, but I've definitely found my way being able to connect with these coaches,” Maiava said. “These coaches have been a huge help for me, so I've been more (intentional) in everything I do.”

Maiva admitted that he had happy feet when he was thrown into the starting lineup. Even though he started for a season at UNLV, it was abundantly clear last year that he's still raw, especially from a technical standpoint. He said this offseason offered him the chance to reflect on those issues during film study, and he's trying to iron them out on the practice field this spring.

“He's not one that you really worry about getting complacent or not wanting to work on the areas he knows he needs to attack,” Riley said. “For him, it's more like, don't be so hard on yourself, we'll be plenty hard enough on you. Make sure you give yourself credit for the plays you have made and the progress you have made as well. So I think, for him, it's a little bit of that balance.”

Maiava's ability to find that balance will go a long way in determining USC's trajectory this fall.

8. Riley described the linebacker unit as “thin” but also expressed excitement about the talent level.

Desman Stephens II and Eric Gentry are the front-runners to start, but I believe the Trojans should target the position in the transfer portal.

Gentry is talented and can make an impact when he's on the field, but he's missed multiple games because of injury in two of his three seasons at USC.

If there is an injury to either Stephens or Gentry, the Trojans would have to count on some inexperienced options, and that would not be a fun experiment in the Big Ten. So that's an obvious position of need.

9. Former linebacker Elijah Newby will practice at defensive end this spring. Newby looks the part physically at 6-foot-3, 232 pounds, but USC wants to see how his athleticism translates to the edge.

“He's got the talent, the mindset,” Riley said of the redshirt freshman. “There's definitely a role. This guy is going to make an impact. I think it's us and him kind of finding that right spot.”

10. The media hadn't spoken to safety Kamari Ramsey much since he decided to return to USC for another season instead of opting for the NFL Draft.

“(I) have some unfinished business, things I wanted to improve, work on, put stuff on tape,” Ramsey said on Thursday. “After long talks with my family, coach (D'Anton) Lynn, coach (Doug) Belk, coach Riley, the best decision for me and my family was to come back and play another year.”

Ramsey's return was huge for the USC defense. He is a tremendous tackler, especially in the open field, and his football IQ stands out in nearly every game.

He is the lone returning starter in the secondary. The battle for the other starting safety spot should be compelling. The staff brought in NC State transfer Bishop Fitzgerald, but junior Christian Pierce has been patiently waiting for his chance and will be heard from in the competition as well.

“Really, my expectations are just to give my all like I've been doing every year,” Pierce said. “Trying to make as many plays as I can on special teams, same as when I get the opportunity on defense.”
