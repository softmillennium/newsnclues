                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Smoke from Nicaraguan cigars choked out the room as a heavy-set Bitcoin miner from the Deep South explained how the industry was expanding at an exponential rate.

"You have no idea," he said at this year's Mining Disrupt pre-party in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, before following up with the common Bitcoiner maxim—repeated by President Trump on the campaign trail—that you should never sell your stash.

Bitcoin hasn't stopped climbing over the years and surged to new highs off the back of President Trump's November victory. The new commander in chief promised during his campaign that he'd help the industry after regulators cracked down hard on crypto companies during ex-President Joe Biden's tenure.


Some of the resulting optimism shined through at the event. However, there was also gloominess at the world's biggest crypto mining expo this week, as those in the fast-moving and arcane industry admitted that they struggled to make ends meet in the increasingly competitive and high-cost world of Bitcoin mining.

Case in point: The price of Bitcoin is now down by 24% from its January all-time high, and trading hands for under $83,000. But mining difficulty has continued to surge to new records—and fast.


"It's just so hard to keep up," said one man with a small business in the cutthroat trade who asked not to be named. He quickly changed topics to talk about his Solana-based side hustle.


Mining Bitcoin is a convoluted, yet topical sphere in the crypto industry. Conceptually, people sort of get why it's important for the space—President Trump even spoke about how vital it was to protect the business—but it's too technical for many to wrap their heads around.

Even crypto people. But the short of it is this: mining Bitcoin requires a lot of resources—namely cheap energy—to satiate loud, powerful machines that keep the payment network in check.


Miners receive newly minted digital coins when they process a block on the blockchain. As the network has grown—as it is supposed to—mining difficulty goes up. And it takes more manpower to stay in the business. When the price of BTC drops, selling the Bitcoin rewards may not be enough to cover the costs.

Basically, mining Bitcoin is no easy industry. And this was a common theme at the conference, including in discussions over ways for mining operations to diversify their operations.


"Bitcoin mining has a great opportunity here," data center guru Chad Everett Harris enthusiastically exclaimed on a panel, all while trying to convince miners to dip their toes into operating AI businesses for extra cash—a growing trend.

Paul Li, CEO of mining technology provider Fog Hashing, added that miners simply couldn't "miss" the opportunity to get stuck into the growing wave of AI.


But as Decrypt learned, moving from minting "digital gold" to running AI data centers isn't easy—even for the big dogs. If even Nasdaq-listed miners are daunted by the prospect of getting involved in the world of AI—a costly and complex venture—then where does that leave smaller players?


A new era? Ahead of his win, President Trump claimed that under his watch, he'd push for all future Bitcoin to be 100% American-made. Miners largely wanted to avoid talking politics with Decrypt, and there wasn't a red hat in sight at the event—unlike the MAGA-heavy Bitcoin 2024 Nashville last summer.


"The new administration is pro-Bitcoin, pro-Bitcoin mining," Shanon Squires from Compass Mining told Decrypt. "The geopolitical risk is gone—at least in my opinion."

But as Bitcoin mining requires more resources as it becomes more mainstream, a crypto-friendly president might not be enough for the smaller players to hang around.

"It's a real business," added Squires. "You have to have efficiencies at scale. You have to know what they're doing. You have to be cost-effective in your acquisition and your procurement, and run a real business."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dark Web Informer, a cyber threat intelligence service, reported on March 27 that over 100,000 Gemini user records are being sold online.

The dataset allegedly contains full names, emails, phone numbers, and location data of U.S.-based cryptocurrency leads tied to Gemini.


On March 26, Dark Web Informer disclosed on X that a threat actor using the alias “kiki88888” listed a database containing Binance user data in 2025 on a hacking forum. The dataset contains 132,744 records linked to Binance.com.

Gemini has not officially confirmed any breach or direct link to the leaked data.


Binance said that the information was not obtained through a direct security breach of their systems. They claimed that the data was gathered through phishing and malware targeting individual users' computers.


The hacker used malware to infect individual users’ computers, which then allowed the hacker to take over the users’ browser sessions and eventually stole the data.

Dark Web Informer’s statement also supports Binance’s claim, suggesting that users might have clicked suspicious links or downloaded malicious software, resulting in their information being compromised.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto and NFT gaming space is busier than ever lately, with prominent games starting to release, token airdrops piling up, and a seemingly constant array of other things happening at all times.

It’s a lot to take in! Luckily, Decrypt’s GG is all over it. And if you need a quick way to get caught up on the latest moves around crypto video games, we’re happy to present This Week in Crypto Games.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has closed its investigation into Ethereum gaming platform Immutable with no enforcement action, the company announced Tuesday via a blog post.

Back in October 2024, the Commission issued Immutable a Wells Notice over alleged securities law violations relating to sales of the platform’s IMX token.

The SEC had also questioned representations about the token's backing, particularly regarding a pre-launch investment from Huobi Ventures.

With this investigation now over, Immutable CEO Robbie Ferguson said that the investigation found “zero wrongdoings” and praised his team for continuing to build despite the ominous Wells Notice.

The company itself also posted on X, stating that it a “huge win” for Web3 gaming and for “everyone who believes in digital ownership rights.”

Off the Grid has been running on the GUNZ testnet, built as a dedicated Avalanche L1 chain. On Friday, it was confirmed that GUNZ would transition to its hotly anticipated mainnet on March 31, with the GUN token launching alongside.

This comes after Gunzilla Games Director of Web3 Theodore Agranat estimated a Q1 2025 launch back in December, adding that he wanted the game to be fully featured and polished by then.

Forgotten Runiverse launched in early access on Wednesday, allowing users to master spells and earn rewards as they explore the open fantasy world based on the Ethereum NFT collection, Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult.

This comes after three years of development work and more than 1 million hours of testing, according to a post by Ronin Network, which became the game’s new home after it opted to migrate from Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>an investor is looking at the price movements of cryptocurrency to determine if the market is in a bull or bear territory.

The typical 20% threshold used to define bull and bear markets in traditional finance may not be applicable to crypto, due to its wider price moves and 24/7 trading.

Crypto is often used as a proxy when traditional markets are closed, increasing the magnitude of the reaction to crypto prices.

Investor sentiment plays an important role in shaping market cycles, with various indicators offering insights into broad trends.


A high Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio suggests potential corrections, while a low ratio indicates undervaluation.

The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) measures profit or loss of moved coins. A value above one signals profit-taking (bullish), while below one indicates selling at a loss (bearish).

The Puell Multiple assesses miner revenue relative to historical norms. High values align with market tops, while low values suggest miner capitulation and potential bottoms.

The Hold On for Dear Life (HODL) waves analyze coin holding periods. Increased long-term holdings suggest bear markets, while declines indicate distribution in bull runs.


A 20% swing should not be considered the standard for measuring whether a market is in bull or bear territory, according to David Duong, Coinbase Head of Institutional Research.

Metrics like the 200-day moving average can provide more accurate information about market trends than traditional thresholds.


Cryptocurrency-specific technical indicators offer unique insights into market behavior. The Market Value to Realized Value ratio and the MVRV z-score are effective tools for gauging market movement.


The Fear and Greed Index aggregates market factors to assess investor sentiment. A value of 0-24 indicates fear, suggesting cautious or bearish sentiment, while a value above 75 reflects greed, signaling optimism or bullish market behavior.

Investors often rely on sentiment as a key indicator to assess whether markets are nearing a top or bottom.


The Crypto Fear and Greed Index stood at 32 (Fear) on March 30, 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although there are many prospects in the crypto market, only a few initiatives have what it takes to yield significant rewards. Cardano (ADA) and Rexas Finance (RXS) are two coins with great growth potential for investors.

Cardano’s Journey to $5.00
Currently trading at roughly $0.72, Cardano has the potential to surge when the fundamentals are favorable. Changelly’s price forecast for Cardano suggests that a breakout above the resistance zone near 0.75 could see the coin race towards $1.20 before heading toward $5.

Rexas Finance’s Rapid Ascent Toward $5.00
Although Cardano is a well-known behemoth, Rexas Finance (RXS) is fast rising and becoming among the most discussed tokens available. Though a younger project, RXS has already shown great promise with its presale, raising over $47.3 million and raising the token price from $0.03 to $0.20.

Rexas Finance is especially positioned to profit from the trillion-dollar market as big companies investigate blockchain-based tokenisation. Starting as tiny ventures before erupting into multi-billion dollar ecosystems, analysts have compared RXS’s path to that of Solana (SOL) and Binance Coin (BNB).

The maximum total supply of RXS tokens is fixed at one billion; therefore, the asset remains rare enough to profit from higher demand. Remarkably, the presale receives half of the overall supply, highlighting the project’s dedication to include the local community and luring first investors.

Moreover, Rexas Finance has set aside 2% of its inventory for a special giveaway program. Twenty fortunate investors under this program stand to earn RXS tokens valued at $50,000.

Two initiatives in various development phases, Cardano and Rexas Finance, have one important quality: they are ready for notable expansion in 2025 and beyond. While Rexas Finance is the new disruptor upending the market with its creative tokenising ideas, Cardano is a seasoned player in the crypto world constantly striving for more acceptance and scalability.

Both tokens might reach $5.00 in the following months, giving investors significant returns as ADA recovers its optimistic momentum and RXS is ready to explode upon debut. These two assets are worth watching for those wishing to profit from the next wave of crypto millionaires.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors in crypto consistently pursue blockbuster altcoins that achieve 50x to 100x value increases throughout a single trading cycle. The crypto breakout of 2021 belonged to SOL, with the Solana price rallying from $1 in 2019 to nearly $300 by 2025.

IntelMarkets (INTL) introduces itself as one of the most innovative AI projects. Developed by a team of MIT, Renaissance Technologies, and OpenAI, the IntelMarkets software has been praised as a leader in the industry.

IntelMarkets (INTL): Combining AI and DeFi for Explosive Potential

IntelMarkets (INTL) develops an AI-based trading platform which aims to construct a revolutionary system for crypto trading. Its upcoming platform integrates self-learning AI algorithms that create automated advanced trading functions alongside real-time large data analysis to provide tips when trading.

The platform is based on dual chains of Ethereum and Solana, operating at high speeds while providing exceptional flexibility that sets itself apart from other AI platforms. The main distinguishing factor of INTL emerges from its stage of development.

INTL tokens are selling in presale at $0.09, as over 150,000 wallets have signed up before its listing on Tier-1 crypto exchanges. Market analysts predict that IntelMarkets could potentially surge by up to 9,700% after its launch.

Solana (SOL): From $1 Underdog to Top-10 Powerhouse

SOL has achieved a remarkable meteoric rise in the crypto space that remains one of the most famous in its recent history. During 2020 Solana’s price was below $1, before experiencing a 290x growth.

Reaching its ATH in Jan 2025, the Solana price surpassed the $294 mark. However, since then, SOL has dropped off. At $140, the Solana price experienced a 52% fall in the last 3 months.

The bearish performance of SOL cannot eclipse the fact that its market capitalization prevents substantial exponential growth in the future. Analysts predict the Solana price will recover back to $200 in Q2.

Why Investors Are Looking Beyond Solana

The demand for AI-powered cryptocurrency solutions continues to escalate in 2025. INTL has launched its presale at an opportune moment to capture this market.

As many traders look for the next big gainer, many realize that Solana’s price isn’t capable of giving the same 300x gains as it once did.

The people who did not invest in SOL during its initial period have a chance to invest in the new AI wave.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2015, Ethereum (ETH) was an under-the-radar asset, trading at mere cents before skyrocketing by 25,000%, turning a modest $830 investment into an astonishing $220,500.

Early adopters who spotted ETH’s potential before the mainstream caught on saw life-changing returns. Fast forward to today, and a new performer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is displaying eerily similar early-stage indicators.

The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale has sold over 93% and continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $5.4 million.


Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 7200 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $5.4 million in total.

Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts.

The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi.


Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability.

A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects.


Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential.

Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as the next big crypto opportunity, with its presale nearly sold out and a 200% ROI potential upon launch. Early investors stand to gain significantly as Phase 4 brings a 25% price jump, pushing MUTM to $0.025 before its projected surge past $1.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to analyst Elliot Chun, Bitcoin is moving from negotiation tables to corporate treasuries and could become standard practice by 2030.

In his prediction, Chun states that by 2030, a quarter of the S&P 500 will have BTC somewhere in its budgets as long-term assets.

The strategy of holding Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset was first adopted by MicroStrategy in August 2020.

Since then, MicroStrategy's actions have increased by over 2,000%, far exceeding both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin in the same period.

GameStop is the latest company to follow this example, announcing that it will acquire $1.3 billion worth of Bitcoin through a convertible bill.

Initially, GameStop's actions increased following the announcement, but have since corrected, descending by almost 15% during the week.

Chun claims that treasurers could soon face career risks not for buying Bitcoin, but for having completely ignored it.

"Do not do anything is no longer a defensible strategy," he wrote.

Companies listed on stock exchanges currently hold 665,618 BTC, about 3.17% of the total supply of the cryptocurrency.

Strategy holds the largest share, with 506,137 BTC.</p>

Bitcoin is making its way from trading desks to corporate treasuries.

Elliot Chun, a partner at Architect Partners, anticipates that by 2030, a quarter of the S&P 500 will have BTC on their balance sheets as a long-term asset.

The strategy of holding bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset was first adopted by Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, in August 2020.

Then CEO Michael Saylor's highly public embrace of bitcoin transformed the company into a de facto proxy for BTC exposure.

MicroStrategy stock has surged more than 2,000% since adopting this strategy.

GameStop is the latest company to follow suit, announcing that it would raise $1.3 billion through a convertible note to acquire bitcoin.

Its stock initially surged following the announcement but has since endured a correction, falling nearly 15% for the week.

According to BitcoinTreasuries data, publicly listed companies currently hold 665,618 BTC, around 3.17% of the cryptocurrency's total supply.

Strategy holds the lion’s share, 506,137 BTC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is a blood bath for digital assets, with traders pressing the sales button, eliminating more than $ 160 billion of the total cryptocurrency market since Friday.

Few things got worse at the end of the first quarter of this year, leading to liquidation, including Trump's tariff threats, global economic concerns, and the lack of a clear catalyst for the next stage.

Based on the total percentage since 2010, April brought an average return of 27% to Bitcoin, marking it as the third best month, according to data from the bar chart. November and May were the other two months with the largest returns, with gains of about 38% and 26%, respectively.

As reported by Coindesk analyst Omkar Godbole, for Crypto Daybook Americas, a premium newsletter that offers help to traders to make informed investment decisions, this seasonality can be a very necessary positive indicator for the market. "Factors of seasonality are not as reliable as independent indicators, but when combined with other signs, such as the recent interruption in sales by long-term holders, they seem reliable," Godbole wrote.

A potential short-term risk is MT. GOX, which has been transferring considerable BTC amounts to Kraken. This can lead to temporary sales pressure or market volatility, said Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In all different strategies and implementations, I predict that by 2030, a room of S&P 500 will have BTC somewhere in its balance sheets as a long-term asset,” Elliot Chun, partner at Architect Partners, wrote.

The strategy - maintaining Bitcoin as a Treasury reserve asset - was little orthodox when Strategy, previously known as Microstrategy, first adopted it in August 2020. The company framed BTC as inflation protection, a diversification tool and a way to stand out in the market.

So Bitcoin's highly public adoption by CEO Michael Saylor turned the company into a proxy in fact for BTC exposure. Since then, Microstrategy shares have risen more than 2,000%, far surpassing S&P 500 and Bitcoin in the same period, said Chun.

Gamestop is the latest company to follow the example, announcing this week that it would raise $1.3 billion through a convertible note to purchase Bitcoin. Their actions initially rose after the announcement, but since then suffered a correction, falling almost 15% a week.

Chun argued that treasurers may soon face career risks not to buy Bitcoin, but for completely ignoring him. “Not doing anything is no longer a defensible strategy,” he wrote.

According to combinations of data, publicly listed companies currently hold 665,618 BTC, about 3.17% of the total cryptocurrency supply. Strategy holds most, 506.137 BTC.</p>
