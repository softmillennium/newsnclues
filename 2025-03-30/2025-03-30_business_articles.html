                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The agreement consists in introducing a deduction in the income tax.

This measure calms the spirits in relation to the dispute that faced the two main forces of the Government and prevents PSOE and Ciudadanos from being faced in Congress.

During these days, the Minister of Finance, María Jesús Montoro threatened to veto the proposal of her minority partner, willing to ally with the PP to carry it forward.

The key to the agreement is to compensate for the SMI beneficiaries that this year would have to make the income statement.

According to the Treasury calculations, the group of workers who charge the minimum wage will have to deal with their obligations with the Tax Agency. 

Half a million of the 2.5 million workers who charge the SMI in Spain.

What has been agreed is a "deduction in the quota" that allows this 20% affected not to reduce their income by having to pay IRPF.

While there are loose fringes, and they have barely transcended details, it is expected that such deduction is of an amount similar to the amount retained by the Treasury. 

Around 300 euros, from the increase of 700 euros per year, which entails the increase of the SMI in 2025 - 16,576 euros gross per year (1,184 in 14 payments) -.

The compensatory measure will benefit 20% of the 2.4 million people who receive the SMI in Spain. 

That is, around 480,000 salaried workers.

What happens to the remaining 80%. Well, it will continue as until now. That is, without having to allocate part of the SMI to the Treasury. 

This is because due to other deductions related to their personal situation, they were exempt from taxing in 2025.

For example, a taxpayer with a partner and a child under 3 years of age who charges the SMI does not apply any retention. 

While this does not happen with the single taxpayer and without children who charge the minimum legal remuneration full-time. 

The idea of ​​the Treasury is that future increases in the minimum wage are disconnected from the debate on taxation.</p>

大和アセットマネジメントの「iFreePlus世界トレンド・テクノロジー株（通称：Zテック20）」が、投資家の間で話題となっている。

これは、いま人気のFANG+だとリスクが高すぎるけど、一般的なインデックス投資では物足りないと感じる人向けの商品だ。

Zテック20とは何か、FANG+とはどう違うのか、詳細を見ていこう。

大型テック株に特化した、オルカン型商品といえるかもしれない。

大和アセットマネジメント（以下、大和AM）が24年末に設定した、「iFreePlus世界トレンド・テクノロジー株（通称：Zテック20）」が、投資家の間で話題になっている。投資対象としている20社は、半導体やIT、電子機器などテック関連企業に限定しながら、アメリカだけでなくグローバルな銘柄から抽出しているからだ。

近年でいえば、テック株10社に均等分散したFANG+指数がトレンドで、そのパフォーマンスの高さが話題となっている。一方で、Zテック20の構成比率は時価総額に応じた加重平均であり、FANG+よりパフォーマンスは劣るが、安定感はありそうだ。

つまり、FANG+はリスクが高すぎるけど、一般的なインデックス投資では物足りないと感じる人向けの商品と言えるかもしれない。Zテック20とは何か、FANG+とはどう違うのか、詳細を見ていこう。

「ルールベース運用」の投信

Zテック20は、2024年12月11日に大和AMが設定した投資信託だ。基準価額は1万円から始まったが、当初から2カ月くらいは堅調に推移していた。しかし、2月末頃から軟調に転じ、3月中旬現在では8600円台を推移している。後述するが同投信の構成銘柄は米テック株が中心であり、ここ最近の市場全体の動きと一致している。

なお、Zテック20という指数はなく、大和AM独自の名称だ。事前に決めたルールに従って投資を行う「ルールベース運用」の投信である。方針をまとめると、主なルールは次の4つだ。

グローバルが対象

日本のほか、特定のリスクが高い中国・ロシアを除く

半導体、ソフトウェア、電子機器、自動車などテクノロジー関連企業

時価総額上位20社を選定（比率は加重平均）

時価総額に応じた構成比率

上記ルールの4つめにある通り、Zテック20は20社で構成されるが、構成比率は時価総額に応じた加重平均となっている。つまり、時価総額が大きい銘柄ほど比率が高い。

2月28日にリリースされた月次レポートによると、上位10社の構成比率は下記の通りだ。比較のためにFANG＋指数との連動を目指す「iFreeNEXT FANG+インデックス」も記載した。

Zテック20 FANG+ 1 アップル 17.1% メタ 10.8% 2 マイクロソフト 14.1% クラウドストライク 10.7% 3 エヌビディア 14.0% ネットフリックス 10.6% 4 アルファベット 10.6% アップル 9.4% 5 アマゾン 9.9% アマゾン 9.3% 6 メタ 8.0% エヌビディア 9.2% 7 テスラ 4.5% マイクロソフト 8.8% 8 ブロードコム 4.4% アルファベット 8.8% 9 TSMC（台湾） 3.7% ブロードコム 8.7% 10 オラクル 2.2% サービスナウ 8.5% 11 SAP（ドイツ） 1.6% - - 12 セールスフォース 1.4% - - 13 ASML（オランダ） 1.3% - - 14 シスコ 1.2% - - 15 サムスン（韓国） 1.1% - - 16 アドビ 0.9% - - 17 サービスナウ 0.9% - - 18 クアルコム 0.8% - - 19 インテュイット 0.8% - - 20 AMD 0.8% - -

Zテック20における構成比率のトップはアップルだ。上位5社で64%、上位10社で87%を占める。一方のFANG＋はテック企業10社への均等分散を基本とし、おおむねねその通りの構成比率になっている。

なお、加重平均（Zテック20）と均等平均（FANG+）には、それぞれ良し悪しがある。当然ながら、各社の時価総額は異なるため、Zテック20のような加重平均では上位企業の構成比率が高くなる。その分、上位企業への依存度が大きく、短期でのリスク分散という点ではFANG+のような均等平均に劣る場面も多いだろう。

ただし、市場全体の動きは時価総額に依存する。そのため、Zテック20のような加重平均の方がインデックスとの相関が大きい可能性が高い。なので、Zテック20はインデックスとFANG+の中間に位置するといえる。

ちなみに、Zテック20の決算は年1回だが、3月末、9月末基準で銘柄入替を実施する方針だという。信託報酬は年率0.495%。最近だと、一般的なインデックスファンドは0.1％を割り込む一方、アクティブファンドは1％前後になる場合が多い。その、まさに中間と言える。

過去実績はS&P500とFANG+の中間

大和AMによると、過去実績においてZテック20は、S&P500とFANG+の中間に位置するという。2015年3月末の数値を100とした場合の24年9月末の数値は、それぞれ次の通りのようだ。

ファンド 2015年3月末の数値を100とした場合の24年9月末の数値 FANG+ 1165 Zテック20 710 NASDAQ100 508 S&P500 331

出展：大和アセットマネジメント

各指数名に付された数字は、そのまま構成銘柄の数を表している（数字の記載がないFANG+は10社）。つまり、上位の指数ほど少数のテック株に集中しており、過去実績上のパフォーマンスは高い。

一方で、チャート上では銘柄数の少ない指数ほどボラティリティが大きくなっている。変動幅が大きく、リスクが高いということだ。

メリット＆デメリット

Zテック20のメリット・デメリットについても考察していこう。まず、わかりやすく一覧表にすると、それぞれ下記の表の通りだ。

メリット デメリット ・少額でテック企業に分散投資できる ・インデックス型よりパフォーマンスが良い ・高リスク地域、低成長地域を除いている ・上位5社の依存度が大きい ・下位10社の影響度が小さい ・信託報酬はインデックス型よりやや高い ・市場に対する逆相関の要素は無い

まずはメリットについて。個別株で20社分を揃えるとなると、多額の資金が必要だが、Zテック20では少額でテック企業に分散投資できる。また、直近10年ではテック企業が世界市場を牽引してきたこともあり、過去のパフォーマンスでは、S&P500などのインデックスよりも優れる。

米中対立が高まるなか、中国を対象外としたのも好材料のひとつだ。日本人としては残念だが、低成長な日本を除外したのも投資家目線では評価できる。そもそも時価総額ランキング30位以内に日本企業はなく、50位以内ではトヨタ自動車しかないのだが……。

次にデメリットを見てみよう。まず、加重平均であるため上位5社の依存度が大きい点が懸念材料だ。上位の1社がショックに見舞われると、Zテック20の基準価額は短期で下落してしまうかもしれない。また、上位10社で9割弱を占めており、下位10社の構成比率は小さい。リスク分散という点で下位10社の存在感は小さくなる。さらに、信託報酬は0.1%前後の商品もあるインデックス型と比較して、やはり高めだ。

また、株式のみで構成されている点も留意しなければならない。ぶっちゃけってしまうと、S&P500やFANG+との差は、おおまかにリスク許容度の違いでしかない。S&P500、FANG+、Zテック20はどれも2月以降の下落局面で軟調に推移している。金価格のように、市場との逆相関関係は無い。

どんな投資家に向いているか

Zテック20はインデックス型と比較して、パフォーマンスは期待できるが、リスクは大きい。そのため人を選ぶところがある。どんな投資家に向いているか、整理しておこう。

1. リスクを許容できる人

筆者は以前よりメインの投資先は、米国型やオルカン型のインデックスファンドにすべきだと主張してきた。だが、サブとしてテーマ型や新興国型など、比較的高リスクな商品に投資するのも有りだと考えている。とはいえ、20社に分散していても、数が少ない分、S&P500などのインデックスファンドよりはリスクが大きい。Zテック20はテーマ型の一種でもあり、リスクを許容できる投資家向けの商品といえそうだ。

2. 高齢者よりは若年層

年齢別で考えた場合、相続を考慮すべき高齢の方は低リスク商品に集中させたほうが良い。「守り」の姿勢で投資先を考えるべきである。ただし若年層であれば、レバレッジを掛けない限り失敗しても問題はない。インデックスよりも高い収益を期待してZテック20に投資するのも選択肢のひとつだ。ただし繰り返しになるが主軸は米国型やオルカン型にすべきであり、あくまでもサブとして位置づけたい。筆者が購入するとすれば、最大でもポートフォリオ全体の20%に抑えるだろう。

3. 特定口座のスポット購入を考えている人

現NISAの年間投資枠は、つみたて投資枠が120万円、成長投資枠が240万円だ。生涯の非課税枠は両枠合わせて1800万円、ただし成長投資枠は1200万円までという制限がある。この枠を埋められる人は限られると思うが、いずれにせよ枠はオルカン型や米国株型で埋めるべきであり、リスク商品は避けておきたい。

Zテック20は成長投資枠の対象商品となっているが、枠が埋まりそうな投資家なら、同投信よりも低リスクの商品にした方が良いだろう。そうした点を踏まえると、スポット購入で何か買いたい、冒険してみたいという投資家向けの商品といえる。

続く下落局面にどう対処するか？

なお、株式市場全体の動きをみると、2月以降、下落傾向が続いている。アフターコロナにおける高成長が一巡したほか、直近では関税をはじめ対外圧力を強めるトランプ大統領の姿勢も影響しているようだ。従来の自由貿易に反する政策が続く限り、市場全体は軟調に推移する可能性が高い。

ただし、投資家が「いつ回復するか？」を予測することはできない。V字回復局面を狙って買いを入れるのは至難の業だ。もしZテック20を買うと決めたなら、回復局面を待たず、今からドルコスト平均法（積立）で買い続けるのが正解といえそうだ。下落局面でのさらなる損失を恐れるなら、分散度の大きいZテック20ではなくインデックスファンドを選んだ方が良いだろう。

まとめ

あらためて「iFreePlus世界トレンド・テクノロジー株（Zテック20）」は、米国を中心とした全世界のテック株20社に、時価総額の加重平均で分散投資する商品である。

過去のパフォーマンスは、S&P500より高く、FANG+よりは低い。その分リスクは、両者の間に位置づけられる。テーマ型の一種と捉えるべきだろう。

新興国型や個別株よりは安全だが、一定のリスクはある。高齢の方よりも若年層向けの商品であり、やや強気な姿勢を持つ投資家向けの商品といえる。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump has condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin for comments made about the leader of Ukraine.

The comments were made after Russian drones hit a military hospital, shopping centre, and apartment blocks in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv, killing two people and wounding dozens.

In an interview with NBC News, Trump referenced Putin's claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lacks the legitimacy to sign a peace deal.

Putin reaffirmed his claim that Zelensky, whose presidential term expired last year, lacks the legitimacy to sign a peace deal.

Under Ukraine's constitution, it is illegal for the country to hold national elections while it is under martial law.

Ukraine's General Staff had earlier denounced the "deliberate, targeted shelling" of the military hospital late on Saturday.

Among the casualties were service members who were undergoing treatment, it said.

Regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said those killed were a 67-year-old man and a 70-year-old woman.

Ukraine's air force reported that Russia fired 111 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks overnight into Sunday.

It said 65 were intercepted and another 35 were lost, having probably been electronically jammed.

Zelensky said on Sunday that over the past week "most regions of Ukraine" had come under Russian attack.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The pending increase of 0.5% retroactive since January 2024 has been guaranteed by the Framework Agreement signed with CCOO and UGT in 2022.

Although it should have already been applied, the government has not yet detailed when it will be paid.

As for the salary increase corresponding to 2025, it has not yet been defined.

The Executive held a meeting with the unions on Monday, March 24, but they left without concretizing anything about it.

López has committed to CCOO, UGT and CSIF to implement an additional rate so that public sector labor can continue to retire in advance.

Also to modify the current regulations so that this right is not lost among the officials.

But how much they will raise their salary this year and the next ones has not given clues.

What is most urgent is to specify the additional rise of 0.5% of the year 2024 linked to inflation, and that all public employees should charge retroactively since January 1 of this year.

Both UGT and CCOO and the Independent and Officials Trade Union Central (CSIF) have urged the Government to approve "as soon as possible."

This salary rise culminates the commitments collected in the framework agreement signed by 2022-2024 with CCOO and UGT.

Known as "Agreement for a 21st Century Administration", this Covenant established salary and labor improvements for public employees.

These were agreed that public payrolls are revalued around 10% since the end of 2021.

Also, a salary rise with a fixed part and another variable, linked to elements such as harmonized IPC or the evolution of GDP.

The agreement expired on December 31 and from CCOO and UGT it is intended to renew with a multinual character.

From CSIF, mobilizations have also been chosen to speed up these requests.

" The government or takes note, or will have a hot spring," said the president of CSIF, Miguel Borra, during the concentration of March 19 against the Ministry of Finance in Madrid.</p>

アルバロ・ムネバール・ジュニア（Alvaro Munevar Jr.）は、副業として不動産の事業を立ち上げ、その後、59歳で引退した。

彼は、ビジネス書や個人金融に関する本を読んだおかげで、早期リタイアの準備を整えられたという。

これらの本は、インデックスファンドの運用や、適切なタイミングで見切りをつけるための戦略的な視点を彼に与えた。

私は30年以上にわたり技術職として働き、2024年に59歳で早期引退した。

私が早期リタイアを実現した秘訣は、中間管理職のポジションに留まり、無理のない労働時間を維持することにあった。

そして、自由な時間を経済的に安定する方法を学ぶことに充て、個人金融に関する本を読み、資産管理を徹底的に研究した。

その研究から得た着想をもとに、不動産の副業を立ち上げ、最終的に仕事を辞めるために必要な追加収入を得られるようになった。

私の早期引退への道を支えた5冊の重要な本を紹介しよう。

1. 『金持ち父さん 貧乏父さん』ロバート・キヨサキ著

個人金融に関して多くの著書があるロバート・キヨサキ（Robert Kiyosaki）が1997年に出版したこの本は、お金について私に新たな考え方を教えてくれた示した。

キヨサキは、「貧乏父さん」として自分の父親のことを語っている。彼はお金に関して一般的な感覚を持ち、限られた資金でやり繰りする教育者だった。

一方、キヨサキのメンターとなった「金持ち父さん」は、ビジネスを所有し、起業を通じて富を築くための情報に基づいた手法をキヨサキに教えた。

特に参考になったのは、資産とは「株式や不動産のようにお金を財布に入れてくれるもの」、負債とは「車のローンや衣類のように財布からお金を減らすもの」と定義したキヨサキの考え方だ。

この本を通じて、自分の購買決定がもたらす影響を理解し、不労所得を生み出す資産としての不動産を購入することの重要性を学んだ。

2. 『Bogle on Mutual Funds（ボーグルのミューチュアル・ファンド論）』 ジョン・C・ボーグル著

バンガード・グループ（Vanguard Group）の創設者であり、インデックスファンドの普及を牽引したジョン・C・ボーグル（John C. Bogle）が1993年に出版したこの本は、投資に関する洞察を私に与えてくれた。

ボーグルは、S&P 500のような市場指数のパフォーマンスに基づき運用する低コストインデックスファンドを、さまざまな市場から選択して所有することを勧めている。これは、ファンドマネージャーが個人投資家の資産を運用する高額なアクティブ型投資信託（ミューチュアル・ファンド）よりもコスト面で優れていると彼は述べている。

この本を読んで、長期的にはS&P 500のリターンを上回るアクティブ運用型ファンドがほとんどないことを理解した私は、ポートフォリオにあったアクティブ型ファンドを、ボーグルが推奨する低コストのインデックスファンドへと切り替えた。

自ら銘柄を選び、「市場平均を上回るリターンを得る」ことは刺激的ではあるが、ギャンブルと同様に、長期にわたって成功し続ける個人投資家はほとんどいない。

3. 『The Addictive Organization（嗜癖する組織）』 アン・ウィルソン・シェフ、ダイアン・ファッセル共著

1988年に出版されたこの本は、企業社会で何が問題となり得るのかについて鋭く描かれている。臨床心理学者のアン・ウィルソン・シェフ（Anne Wilson-Schaef）と、経営コンサルタントのダイアン・ファッセル（Diane Fassel）によって執筆された。

本書では、個人の「嗜癖（しへき）」のような不健全なアプローチを取るカルチャーを持つ企業があると説明されている。例えば、道徳に反する問題があってもそれを認めなかったり、従業員を燃え尽きさせるほど過剰な生産性向上を求めたりするといったことだ。

著者たちは、これらの嗜癖的なマネジメント手法が、従業員を過剰にコントロールし、恐怖の雰囲気を作り出すリーダーを生み出すと述べている。

これを読んで、私は企業でキャリアアップを目指す気持ちが薄れ、本業の他に自分のビジネスを始めたいという思いが強まった。

4. 『Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away（見切りをつける：去るべき時を知ることのパワー）』アニー・デューク著

私は2022年に出版されたアニー・デューク（Annie Duke）の本を読み、目が覚める思いだった。そしてアメリカの企業カルチャーを離れて引退したいという気持ちがさらに強くなった。

認知心理学のバックグラウンドを持つ元プロポーカープレイヤーのデュークは、この本で戦略的に仕事を辞める方法、そしてさらに重要な「いつ辞めるべきか」について解説している。

本の冒頭で、デュークはボクシングのヘビー級チャンピオン、モハメド・アリ（Muhammad Ali）のキャリア後半について触れ、彼が年齢を重ねても戦い続け、いつ辞めるべきかわかっていなかったと述べている。

私はこの本を通じて、挑戦しがいがなくなり、面白さも感じなくなったキャリアにさらなる時間を投資するのは間違いだということがわかった。また、同じポジションに長く留まることで機会を失う可能性もあると気づかされた。

5. 『DIE WITH ZERO 人生が豊かになりすぎる究極のルール』 ビル・パーキンス著

引退への最終章に私を導いてくれた本は、2020年に出版されたビル・パーキンス（Bill Perkins）の『DIE WITH ZERO 人生が豊かになりすぎる究極のルール』だ。彼はヘッジファンドマネージャー、起業家、そしてポーカープレイヤーでもある。

この本は、お金の本当の使い方を私に教えてくれた。そして、年齢を重ねるほど、お金を楽しむための時間とエネルギーが減少することを思い起こさせてくれた。

お金の価値は年齢とともに変わる。若くてエネルギッシュな時期には、100万ドルや1000万ドルには途方もない価値がある。それを使って旅行に出かけ、未知の場所を訪れ、趣味を追及し、友人と一緒に時間を過ごすことができる。だが85歳になると100万ドルや1000万ドルの価値は同じようには感じられなくなる。比較的健康であったとしても、エネルギーを必要とする活動を楽しむことは難しくなるだろう。

今、私が持っているお金は、70代や80代になったときよりも価値が高い。それをこの本から学んだ。そして、可能なうちにその財産を楽しみたいという気持ちが強くなった。

個人金融の知識を身につけさせてくれた本

これらの本のおかげで、私は個人金融の知識を身につけ、60歳になる前に引退を果たすことができたと考えている。3、40年前の本もあるが、その教訓は当時と同様に今でも十分に価値があると思う。

これらの本を読んで、資金の動かし方、投資戦略の構築方法、そしてなぜ企業にしがみ続けるべきではないのかについて学んだ。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With Netflix's new drama Adolescence, Erin Doherty has shed light on her personal life.

Erin Doherty, an English actress, plays a key role in Netflix's recent drama Adolescence. The series explores themes of identity and adolescence through various storylines. Doherty is known for her breakout role as Princess Anne in the Channel 4 series The Crown.

Doherty has been praised by critics for her nuanced portrayal of characters in Adolescence. Her performance was described as "unbearably tense" by fans who have discovered the show. She discussed how she relates to the themes of the drama, stating that she is an outsider and often finds herself in unusual situations.

In a conversation with Doherty, it became clear that Adolescence appealed to her due to its realistic portrayal of characters from different backgrounds. The actress expressed empathy for Gen Z, who are growing up as internet natives, and stated that it "just completely freaks me out." She admitted to being awful at her phone and leaving family members on read.

Doherty has a small circle of friends and family who provide her with support. Unlike many celebrities, she doesn't rely heavily on social media for validation or interaction. Instead, her loved ones serve as her barometer for her success. "If my people are telling me that it's all good, then that's enough," Doherty said.

Erin Doherty discussed the importance of queer representation in storytelling. She expressed a desire to focus on telling nuanced and detailed stories about queer relationships and experiences. The actress was inspired by the collaboration between Steven Graham and Jack Thorne on Adolescence, which she believes provided a level of depth to the characters' struggles.

In conclusion, Erin Doherty's latest project Adolescence highlights her dedication to exploring complex themes through character-driven storytelling.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UK businesses face billions of extra costs as wages and tax rise.

Retail and hospitality bosses have warned that higher labour costs and taxes are set to push up prices for customers across the UK.

A raft of measures linked to the Labour government’s first budget will come into force on 1 April, including a rise in the national minimum wage and higher property tax payments.

Millions of UK workers will benefit from a rise in the national minimum wage to £12.21 an hour on Tuesday, representing an increase of 77p.

The move has forced many of the UK’s largest employers to increase their rates of pay, with supermarket groups Tesco and Sainsbury’s among firms to announce they would hike their basic pay above the new minimum.

However, this discount will be reduced to 25 per cent from 1 April.

The drop in the discount means that the average small shop will now see its business rates spiral from £3,589 to £8,613, according to analysis from global tax firm Ryan.

Its research also showed that the overall business rates bill for firms in England will rise by £1.5bn for the year as a result of the change.

Pub, retail and leisure bosses have called for an overhaul of the business rates regime in the Government’s next budget.

From Tuesday, supermarkets, food producers and online retailers will also be hit by a new plastic packaging tax.

Retailers will be liable to pay a charge, based on weight, for every item of packaging they use in the products that they sell.

The Food and Drink Federation has warned that the tax, which could raise up to £2bn, is likely to lead to higher prices for consumers.</p>

His former teammate Yuki Tsunoda has been promoted to partner four-time world champion Max Verstappen.

Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko said the decision to demote Lawson was due to his performance not being "good enough" and attributed it to lack of self-confidence.

He stated that Lawson is not kicked out of F1, but will have a chance to recover at Racing Bulls with a car capable of getting into the top 10 in qualifying.

Marko cited examples of Pierre Gasly and Alex Albon who were demoted in the past but are now competitive F1 drivers.

Andrew Street, partner in BCLP's business and commercial disputes team, said any claims Lawson might bring will depend on the specific terms of his contract with Red Bull.

Street noted that most well-advised teams have negotiated contractual discretions to allow them to move drivers between operations.</p>

My family loves Pura Vida's open fire grilled root vegetables and Kirkland Signature's Chicken Pot Pie.


We, who have been a Costco member for eight years, recently decided to upgrade to executive membership.

The annual fee is $65 (about 10,000 yen), but most purchases will receive up to 2% return.


Costco has raised the annual membership fees for executive members from $120 to $130 this year, but for our family of four, it's definitely worth it.


Here are some of our favorite products that will make the most of our executive membership.

Pura Vida's direct fire-grilled root vegetables contain sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, red onions, and more. 

It is seasoned with extra virgin olive oil, pink Himalayan salt and black pepper, but at home, we add a little honey to eat.

Kirkland Signature's cod fried food is crispy, easy to eat, and very tasty.


The Kirkland Signature diapers are sturdy and have a high waistband so they don't leak easily.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Campbell has advised some of the most important names in the technological sector.

He was a mentor to leaders like Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, and Google executives Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

Ruth Porrat, president of Alphabet, spoke about her experiences with Campbell in an episode of "Good Company".

"He was always a wise voice that spoke clearly and bluntly," says Porrat.

Campbell's influence on Eric Schmidt was so great that he, along with Jonathan Rosenberg and Alan Eagle, nicknamed him the "Trillion Dollar Coach" in a book.

The book includes testimonies from executives who benefited from Campbell's teachings, including current Google head Sundar Pichai.

Some of what they learned from Campbell is as follows:

When Porrat first assumed her position at Google, Campbell worried about how her husband would adjust to the change.

"He worried about everything that personally affected you," says Porrat.

Campbell knew how to reinforce his students' convictions, which helped Porrat carry out "any task of enormous proportions".

Pichai also benefited from the holistic approach to coaching by Campbell, who gave him perspective on his daily routine.

Campbell taught Pichai that what truly matters is how you live your life and the people with whom you share it.

When Pichai became CEO of Google, Campbell advised him to focus on choosing a good team.

Scott Cook, co-founder of Intuit, was also influenced by Campbell's approach to leadership.

Cook appreciated that each person had a different story and background.

Campbell's commitment to transparency influenced Cook's own leadership style.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jaws marks its 50th anniversary since its release.

The film, released in 1975, sold at $260.7 million. The production is well known for its various issues and complex situations.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the film, which quickly made Steven Spielberg famous and redefines box office success.

Jaws, released in the United States on June 20, 1975, was said to be the first "smash hit film," and created a new genre of high-performance films from major studios.


The novel that was originally written for the film was inspired by a real shark.

Author Peter Benchley wrote the novel inspired by the story of a real-life Shark Hunter. He was inspired by Long Island fisherman Frank Mandas, who caught a shark about 5.2 meters long and weighed about 2 tons in 1964.

In his 1974 novel Jaws, Benchley took inspiration from Mandas' shark hunting career and wrote the character of Captain Quint.


The film producers bought the rights to make it into a film before the novel was released.

Before the novel was released, producers Richard Zanak and David Brown had obtained copies of the manuscript. They bought the rights to make the novel into a film for $150,000 (currently $1.08 million).</p>

Z/Yen’s 37th Global Finance Centre’s Index showed London was on the cusp of taking New York’s fintech crown, and a flurry of fintech listings may not only take the Square Mile to the top of global fintech, but also re-energise the embattled LSE.

Monzo increased its valuation to £4.5bn in October 2024 following a secondary share sale and boasts over 10m customers.

In June 2024, the fintech’s chief executive TS Anil told City AM he wished to grow the business “several times” larger before an IPO.

Speculation of a listing mounted after the neobank appointed Tom Oldham, a former Nubank executive, as its chief financial Officer in November.

Monzo touted Oldham’s role “during a transformative period of hypergrowth and Nubank’s IPO,” which took place in New York in December 2021.

The fintech unicorn boasts gross lending over £2bn and deposits north of £5.4bn making it one of the most hotly awaited IPOs in the UK.

In 2022, Starling had its first full year of profitability after posting pre-tax profit of £32.1m.

The digital bank increased signs it was gearing up for an IPO after it began recruiting for a London-based role to work with senior management to “execute a successful IPO or other capital event”.

John Mountain, the fintech’s interim chief executive, discussed a potential flotation and said whilst a location had not been confirmed, London would be a “natural home”.

The UK-based buy now, pay later firm is expected to go public in the next 12 to 24 months after securing £100m in debt financing from Deutsche Bank.

Zilch was also seen to be gearing up for a flotation after it announced plans to double its headcount over the next 18 months.

Speaking at an Innovate Finance summit in October 2024, the fintech’s chief executive Philip Belamant said: “We’re a British business. We’re born here, the headquarters is here, we’re going to be doubling the size of the staff – we’re hiring more than 400 people over the next year and a half here in the UK – and our customer base today is here.

“So we think wouldn’t it be fantastic for businesses to list here. We think that is the right thing.”

ClearScore

The fintech boss also praised the “vibrant” fintech sector in the City.

Whilst he didn’t ignore the City’s challenges, addressing the lack of “homegrown growth equity” compared to US public markets, he said UK investors were beginning to “wrap their heads around the opportunities to invest behind growth”.

Zopa

Digital bank Zopa cemented its unicorn status after fundraising £80m, which included money from an arm of the AP Moller conglomerate.

The London-based lender, which launched as a fully licensed bank in 2020, announced late last year it was on the hunt for new acquisitions as it looked to compete with the likes of Monzo and Starling.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Dutch government is considering a plan to cap energy prices, which would limit how much energy companies can charge consumers.

The European Union's gas storage facilities are nearly empty, and the continent faces a challenging winter ahead.

Oil prices have fallen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of factors, including uncertainty about US trade policy and OPEC+ plans to increase oil production.

Electricity prices have decreased for both variable and fixed contracts in March compared to the previous month, according to data from PriceWise.

The average variable electricity price fell by 6 percent, while the fixed 1-year and 3-year contracts fell by 6 percent and 5.5 percent respectively.

Gas prices have also decreased, with a 7 percent drop for 1-year fixed contracts in March compared to the previous month.

Overall, gas prices are still higher than they were a year ago, but the rate of increase has slowed down.

The US economy is showing signs of cooling, which could lead to a recession and further decrease in stock prices.

Analysts from Bank of America expect that if the US economy enters a recession, a further decrease in the S&P 500 index is more than 10 percent possible.

The Amsterdam main index (AEX) has achieved a profit of over 4 percent since the start of the year.

American stock exchanges have been affected by great uncertainty about the trade policy of President Donald Trump and concerns about economic cooling in the US.

Gasoline and diesel prices fell in March, with an average price of €1.89 for unleaded gasoline and €1.67 for diesel.

The international market for oil saw a sharp fall in prices in February and early March, followed by a slight increase to around $73 per barrel at the end of March.

Electricity prices have become more competitive, making it difficult to choose between variable and fixed contracts.

The energy tax and VAT are not included in the prices mentioned above.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Kittyhawk, the startup of flying cars of Google Larry Page co-founder, was coming to the end of 2022, its technology director, Chris Anderson, brought together a handful of employees and began working on something new.

Anderson had been fascinated by the potential for additive manufacturing - also known as 3D impression - to transform the world. Page, meanwhile, had led Kittyhawk engineers to explore the use of 3D printing to build pieces of their flying vehicles, believing that it could drastically reduce the cost of production.

Their interests have crystallized in a new startup called Dynatomics, which explores ways to use artificial intelligence (AI) and additive manufacturing to build airplanes, according to commercial documents reviewed by Business Insider and several people familiar with the startup.

Dynatomics is funded by Page and directed by Anderson from Palo Alto, in California. The business was registered in California in June 2023, and a domain name of the website for Dynatomics was insured around the same moment.

Additive manufacturing consists of building layers of material on an object. The aeronautical industry already uses this process to reduce the cost and increase the manufacturing speed of some components, but everything becomes more difficult when larger parts are produced or different materials are combined.

People familiar with the project claim that Page and Anderson are studying how to use AI to improve the manufacturing process. In Kittyhawk, Page asked Anderson and then CEO, Sebastian Thrun, that employees designed flying vehicles with 3D printed parts.

In 2023, Dynatomics resorted to a research group from the Technological University of Tallin, in Estonia, who had just won a National Research Award for his work in the additive manufacture of machines. 

Dynatomics paid 60,000 euros for university for consulting services "related to additive manufacturing electrical machines", as recorded in an online database that publishes information about subsidies and a person familiar with the association.

A 2023 research work of a researcher at the University of Tallin who consulted Dynatomics described how the use of AI with additive manufacturing can "mitigate printing failures, reducing waste, costs and production time."

Page was attracted to the idea that 3D printing and cheap components available in the market could offer a new way for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL).

When he ordered Kittyhawk employees to study a series of projects with 3D printing technology in 2022, Anderson faced some employees who considered that Page asked for things that challenged the laws of physics.

Anderson told staff during a 2022 meeting with Kittyhawk that Page's son had given his father a Christmas shirt in which he read: "I am crazy about planes."

The company has never come to approach the figure of manufacturing a flying car for 50,000 euros.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>佐藤さん：資本主義社会において、資本家は拡大再生産によって資本をどんどん増やしていきます。言い換えると、資本はつねに自己増殖を続けるということです。

シマオ：えーっと、経営者（資本家）は会社を作って人を雇って儲けを出して、その儲けでまた会社を大きくして、売り上げも増えていくってことですよね？

佐藤さん：その通りです。そして企業は、競合企業と熾烈な競争を繰り広げることになります。その競争を勝ち抜くためには、そこで働く人たちも常に競争し合い、生産力や競争力を高めていくことが求められます。

当然、企業はそんな競争社会に適応した人材を求めます。受け入れられるには、学生の頃から競争社会の中で能力を高め、勝ち抜いていく必要がある。

シマオ：なるほど……。中学受験も、その競争原理が幼い子どもたちにまで及んだ結果ということなんですね。

佐藤さん：そういうことです。そしてそこから、shoe-realさんが言う、「自分は何者かでなければいけない」とか、「人より幸せでなければならない」という強迫観念が強く出てくる訳です。競争意識が内面化した結果です。

シマオ：でも、それって純粋な向上心とは違うんでしょうか？

佐藤さん：本来、向上心というのは過去の自分と比較して成長を喜ぶものです。人目を気にして無理に努力するものではありません。やたら人と比較したり、劣等感や優越感を感じたりするというのは、それが社会によって作られた価値観、基準や評価によっているからです。

シマオ：いろいろ語学を学んだり、資格を身につけたりするというのも、そういう部分があるのでしょうか？

佐藤さん：もちろん自分自身の能力を向上させ、自信を持つことは大事なことです。ただ、そうやって誰もが必死に自分の能力を高めてくれたら国や企業にとってはありがたい。だからあえて向上心を煽るということもあるでしょう。

シマオ：作られているというのは、そういう意味なんですね。

佐藤さん：それに、いい成績を出すには塾に通ったり教材を買ったりしますよね。するとそれに対応した教育ビジネスが儲かる。とにかく人の欲望や不安をかき立て、「何とかしなきゃ」「頑張ってやらなきゃ」と思わせて購買意欲につなげるというのも資本主義の構造な訳です。

シマオ：怖いなぁ……。自分が自主的に頑張っているつもりでも、実はそれが大きな構造の中で踊らされているだけなのかもしれないってことですよね。

佐藤さん：その通りです。それが「資本主義が身体化される」ということです。本人も気づかぬうちに「資本主義で生きる仕様」になってしまう。

シマオ：自分の意志で選択していると思っているからタチが悪いですね……。でも自分がどっぷりと浸かっている社会の仕組みを意識するって難しくないですか？

佐藤さん：実はエリートほどその罠にはまってしまうんです。なぜならエリートこそ、その社会構造に最も適応し、それによって評価されてきた人たちだからです。おそらく、sho-realさんも受験エリートだったんじゃないでしょうか。

シマオ：確かに。大企業に勤めても自分が何者かになれる訳ではないと分かったとありますから、そうかもしれないですよね。

脱却のための「ゼロからの『資本論』」

amazon

佐藤さん：資本主義の人格化から脱却するための一冊を薦めておきましょう。斎藤幸平さんの新刊、「ゼロからの『資本論』」です。斎藤さんは東大を中退してドイツでマルクスについて学び、いま東大の准教授を務めている若手の学者です。『人新世の「資本論」』がベストセラーになったので、知っている方も多いでしょう。

シマオ：マルクスの資本論をいまの時代に合わせて分かりやすく解説していることで話題になりましたね！

佐藤さん：斎藤さんは共産主義のような国家単位での大きな話ではなく、地域の人たちの集まりや市民社会という、小さな単位でのつながりに資本主義を脱構築するヒントがあると指摘しています。

つまり、人間はもともと仲間を作り、助け合うことで進化し歴史を築き上げてきた。資本主義的な競争社会というのは実は近代以降の非常に特殊な形態で、本来人は互いに協力し合うことに喜びと価値を見出してきたということです。

シマオ：資本主義的な競争社会で人間がずっと生きてきた訳ではないってことですね。ましてや、10歳から受験戦争するなんて……。

佐藤さん：そうです。私たちが当たり前だと考えている資本主義社会というものを相対化するには、この社会を構造的に捉え、別の価値観で見直す「理論」が必要なんです。本来、マルクス経済学がその役目を担ってきたのですが、ソビエト崩壊後、無価値で時代遅れの理論というレッテルを貼られてしまった。斎藤さんはそのマルクスの理論をより現代に適合させた形で復活させた一人でしょう。

シマオ：ぜひ僕も読んでみたいと思います！

佐藤さん：何より、資本主義社会というのは科学やテクノロジーの進化と歩みを同じくしているため、どんどん加速していくのが特徴です。例えばグラハム・ベルが電話を作って、それが5000万人に使われるようになるまでには75年の時間がかかったそうです。

同じように、特定のモノやサービスが5000万人に使われるようになるまでかかった時間を比べてみると、テレビが22年、パソコンは14年、携帯が12年、インターネットは7年と、どんどん早くなる。そしてYouTubeが4年、Twitterが2年で、LINEはたった1年、『ポケモン GO』に至ってはなんと2週間。世の中のスピードがどんどん速くなっているのが分かるでしょう。

シマオ：本当ですね……。異常なまでの加速ぶりです。

佐藤さん：私たちの生きる社会は加速度的に回転を速めるメリーゴーランドのようなものです。みんな必死でしがみつきますが、どんどん振り落とされる。特に東京のような大都市だとそれが顕著です。だから受験勉強もどんどん難しくなるし、会社の仕事もどんどん高度になり、量も増えていく。ポスト争いも激しくなる。

シマオ：なんだか、年を経るごとに生きるのが大変になっていくようですね……。

佐藤さん：だから、押し付けられた競争＝ゲームからどこかで「降りる」という選択が必要なんだと思いますよ。

世の中からちょっと軸足をずらす

シマオ：おそらくshoe-realさんも競争の虚しさにどこかで気が付いているんだと思います。でも正直、若くしてそこから降りるのは難しい気が……。

佐藤さん：であれば、競争に参加しながらもその価値観だけに染まるのではなく、もっと別の、自分なりの価値観を持っておくといいでしょう。それだけでもずいぶんいろいろなものを相対化して見ることができるはずです。

シマオ：例えば、趣味とか恋愛とか、友人関係とかでしょうか？

佐藤さん：はい。友人関係で言えば、現在いる友人に限定する必要はありません。斎藤さんも言うように、仕事やビジネスとは関係ない人間関係をどう築くか。例えば、趣味のサークルだとか読書会だとか共通のテーマでつながる人間関係を持つ。あるいはバーやスナック、飲めない人なら喫茶店などの常連になって、同じ常連さんと友達になるとか、そういう人間関係を築くことも一つの手だと思います。

このような関係を「アジール」と呼ぶのですが、利害関係のない、ホッとできる仲間のような関係性を指します。その中で見返りを求めないやり取りをする。例えば集まった仲間に自分が旅行先で買ってきたお土産をあげるとか、田舎から送られてきたものを配るとか。対価を求めない関係を築くことが大切です。

シマオ：なるほど。貨幣経済やビジネスとは違う原理での関係ということですね。

佐藤さん：いずれにせよ、自分自身が潰れないためにも、いまの資本主義社会の特異性と異常性に気づかないといけない。どっぷりとその構造に浸ってしまっている都会型のエリート層ほど、脱出するための「理論」を身につけたり、相対化するための価値観を育てていったりする必要があるということです。

シマオ：まずは、自分たちを取り巻く構造とその状況を客観的に知ることが大事だということですね。shoe-realさん、参考になりましたでしょうか。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence (AI), like social networks, could be one more in the long list of technologies that make us feel worse.

Openai launched Chatgpt over two years ago, attracting 400 million weekly active users worldwide.

Researchers from OpenAI and MIT Media Lab have published an article analyzing millions of chat conversations and thousands of audio interactions with Chatgpt. They also surveyed 4,000 users about their behavior with the Bot.

In another study, MIT Media Lab analyzed the interaction of about 1,000 users with ChatgPT for four weeks, compiling text and voice data in personal, impersonal and open conversations.


Researchers claim to have discovered that Chatgpt can worsen feelings of loneliness in a group of "advanced users."

"Our analysis reveals that a small number of users is responsible for a disproportionate part of the most affective signals,"

Researchers found that those who spend more time chatting with the chatbot, especially in voice mode, are more likely to feel lonely and have lower levels of socialization.

Those who use Chatgpt excessively also tend to experience higher levels of loneliness and dependence.

A vicious circle was observed: Chatgpt's voice mode makes users feel less alone at first, but those already feeling isolated were more likely to overuse the tool and worsen their state.


The researchers analyzed the interaction of users with the advanced chatgpt voice mode, a voice-to-voice interface.

For the study, two modes were used: neutral and sympathetic. Advanced users experienced a greater increase in loneliness when interacting with a neutral mode compared to a sympathetic one.


Both studies used Chatgpt through GPT-4O, a multimodal model capable of reasoning through audio, vision, and text.

The results have nuances, especially because feelings of loneliness and social isolation usually fluctuate and can be influenced by various factors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to Bank of America, Nvidia investors have to mark a new date on their calendar.

American investment bank analysts are pending May 15, the day on which the United States government plans to launch the so-called artificial intelligence dissemination rule, a new regulatory framework that aims to control the access of foreign countries to US microchips from Punta Technology. These standards would impose restrictions on some Nvidia chips sales and could reduce their market share.

"There is a wide range of results and NVDA shares could continue to be volatile until the date of May 15, when the impact could be reflected in the actions," explained the experts of the investment bank.

Analysts have referred to a possible recovery of GM, which announced an association with NVIDIA earlier this month, as well as the new microchip the company directed by Jensen Huang, the Blackwell Ultra. During the last presentation of the results of the chips designer, his CEO, Huang, said that Blackwell's demand was already "extraordinary."

Bank of America has reiterated its purchase rating for the shares of this company and has set an objective price for the same of 200 dollars (about 185 euros at the current exchange rate), which implies a 75% rise compared to its current levels. Nvidia shares quoted around $ 110 - 101 euros - this Friday and its value has dropped 20% so far this year.

Earlier this month, investors had their eyes on the GPU technological conference - graphic processing units, for Nvidia, known in this industry as the "Super Bowl of the AI", in which Huang announced some novelties on the projects of the company that are to come. The actions have fallen again this week before the news that Nvidia runs the risk of losing business in China, as a consequence of the new energy efficiency standards of the Asian country, which would prohibit the sale of some microchips.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Historically, economic progress has been driven by seismic shifts in how we value things.

From the agrarian economies that once sustained early civilizations to the industrial revolutions that mechanized production – each era reshaped society's priorities.

In the late twentieth century, the rise of the 'knowledge economy' placed information and cognitive thinking at the heart of progress.

But today, as the implementation of artificial intelligence accelerates, we find ourselves at another crossroad.

The 'knowledge' based economy is on its way out, and an innovation economy is on its way in, said Aneesh Raman, chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn.

Machines can now analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns or generate human-like text in the matter of seconds – tasks that once required years of expertise.

Yet, as AI takes over knowledge-based work, information alone is no longer enough.

It falls short in defining the problems worth solving, or imagining a future that does not yet exist.

Business leaders have already recognized this shift.

LinkedIn data revealed that 90 per cent of C-suite executives reportedly consider AI as a top priority, with businesses pouring billions into AI-driven automation and decision making.

According to Accenture, 73 per cent of companies are channeling their digital investments into AI, recognizing its potential to boost productivity and unlock entirely new markets.

AI and the workforce myth

Despite fears of AI replacing jobs, the reality is more nuanced.

By 2030, nearly 70 per cent of the jobs that will exist have yet to be invented.

This presents a paradox where AI will replace certain tasks, but it will also create entirely new industries and career paths.

The AI market is projected to surpass $800bn in 2030, with AI agents handling a growing share of business functions.

Chinese startup DeepSeek proved to global tech players just how affordable AI-powered systems can be, launching an advanced chat bot at a fraction of the cost of similar, US developed models.

The real challenge won't be job losses – or the idea of being 'replaced'.

Rather, it will be whether organizations or individuals are prepared to redefine their roles.

"We are moving from an era of humans supporting technology, to one where technology supports human potential," added Raman.

As Jensen Huang, chief executive of chip giant NVIDIA, said: "You're not going to lose your jobs to AI, but rather to someone who uses it."

In the UK, the anaemic growth of IT skills among Brits has widened the AI skills gap – meaning we don't have the level of expertise across the country to accommodate this shift.

The lost Einsteins

While leaning towards innovation promises a new frontier of economic growth, systemic barriers continue to hold back potential pioneers.

A sobering reality remains that economic privilege still plays a significant role in determining who can innovate successfully.

Research from MIT reveals that children from high-income families are 10 times more likely to become inventors than their lower income peers.

The synergy of humans and AI

The conversation around AI has too often been framed in extremes – either as a dystopian, job-thieving technology, or an over-hyped trend with limited impact.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saving rates among UK households are at their highest since the pandemic.

The worst of the cost-of-living crisis is, for most households, moving further into their rear-view mirror.

The Bank of England's rate setters have successfully – if belatedly – reined in the worst of the inflation that caused so many households to tighten their belts after the gas price shock of 2022.

The Bank Rate – having shot up over five per between the start of 2022 and half-way through 2023 – has begun to drift downward.

Some storied financial institutions like Panmure Liberum and Goldman Sachs are even pricing in as many as six interest rate cuts over the course of this year.

In other words, monetary conditions are loosening. Disposable incomes are rising, albeit slowly.

And with that – and despite the best efforts of our moribund economy – people should be feeling better off, loosening the hatches that they'd firmly battened down over the preceding three years.

But that hasn't been the case. In fact, savings rates are the highest they have been since the height of the pandemic.

Figures released by the Office for National Statistics on Friday morning found that the saving ratio – the amount of disposable income that people choose to save – had risen to 12 per cent in the fourth quarter.

This is up from 10.3 per cent in the previous three months and 8.3 per cent this time last year.

In other words, despite macroeconomic conditions suggesting people might be minded to loosening the purse strings, excluding the pandemic we – as a nation – are squirrelling more money away than since the aftermath of the financial crash.

And households' collective caution is – economists say – weighing on the economy. More money being siphoned off into bank accounts – while healthy for people's financial resilience – spells less spending, less economic activity and – by extension – less economic growth.

Jessica Hinds, a director in Fitch Ratings' economics team, believes consumers are worried about a potential downturn in their economic fortunes.

Reports of firms cutting jobs in response to bare down on rising costs could be weighing on people's minds – particularly those in lower- to middle-income households. This combined with the spectre of rising energy bills, water bills and post-national insurance price hike jitters have all contributed, she says, to consumers' reticence to let loose.

Fitch does anticipate consumer spending only picking up marginally across the year, to 0.9 per cent, from 0.7 per cent in 2024.

ING's chief UK economist James Smith believes it's more to do with what has passed.

Smith believes many in the country are currently re-feathering their nests, after many people's reserves were depleted during the cost of living crisis.

"One theory here is that this [the higher savings ratio] is 'consumption smoothing'," he tells City AM. "Households were hit with the gas price shock of 2022, and they're compensating for it now with higher savings rates now real wage growth has turned positive again."

Wealthier households are "taking advantage" of this more appealing yield, especially those who have mortgages and were still enjoying paying a fixed payment at low, pre-cost-of-living-crisis levels.

The European Central Bank (ECB) rate setter Isabel Schnabel said that Europeans' reluctance to spend could be down to low financial literacy levels.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, has faced criticism over her handling of economic growth in her first six months in office.

Wobbly growth is the opposite of what Rachel Reeves would have hoped for in her first six months as Chancellor.

The Office for National Statistics showed that GDP per head had dropped since Labour took office in July: down 0.3 per cent in the third quarter and a further 0.1 per cent in the last quarter.

Economists suggested that there was a more pressing matter at hand, despite the headline figure saying the UK economy had only expanded by 0.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2024.

Panmure Liberum economist Simon French published a chart on X showing UK GDP per capita figures lagging behind a G7 average.

"There will be little electoral credit for growth until this inflects higher," he said.

Speaking to City AM, French said recently published figures should not be taken as an indictment of Reeves' fiscal policy choices made so far.

But he did say the metric will be essential to final judgements on whether the Chancellor by the next election.

In terms of quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year [GDP per capita figures], particularly less than a year into the new government, attributing anything to Labour is a bit unfair," French said.

Sandra Horsfield, an economist at Investec, stated that GDP per capita is probably the best measure for comparing the size of economy over time and how it's evolving in different countries.

The Chancellor is coming under pressure to make Brits richer in the short term.

Rachel Reeves drifted away from GDP and highlighted one key OBR estimate as essential to her mission in delivering growth.

"The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) say today that people will be on average over £500 a year better off under this Labour government," she told Parliament.

She appeared to be pointing to a paragraph in page 36 of the OBR's economic and fiscal outlook report.

The OBR reported: "We expect real household disposable income (RHDI) per person to grow at an average of around half a percent a year in the five years from 2025-26 to 2029-30."

Growth [in RHDI] is projected to vary significantly around this average, first slowing sharply from 2.5 per cent in 2024-25 to almost no growth in 2027-28.

Her reliance on RHDI has come under intense scrutiny since the Spring Statement.

The Resolution Foundation made an independent analysis of data put out by the OBR and published figures that come into direct conflict with her statement.

Reeves remained defiant, stating "living standards are growing at their fastest rate in two years".

She said, "Getting more money in working people's pockets is my number one mission."

But this was contradicted by statistics showing that the increase in RHDI was mostly used to increase savings and pay off debt.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rachel Reeves' good intentions mean nothing against rising inflation, meagre growth and falling employment.

One thing that I don’t think can be doubted about Rachel Reeves is her intentions. Like any Chancellor, of course she wants to achieve growth, prosperity and higher living standards. Of course she wants investment to increase, government debt to fall and unemployment to decline.

The problem isn’t her intentions. It’s that every single action she has taken has undermined them.

Labour progress report: Inflation up, growth down

Let’s start with inflation. Her stated aim is to hold it at the two per cent target she inherited from the last government. Instead, she has pumped £70bn a year extra into public spending – including huge public sector pay rises – and inflation has risen nearly a per cent since Labour have been in office.

This has caused interest rates to stay higher for longer. That’s not just a problem for businesses and households. As we found out last week, higher government borrowing costs have contributed to wiping out her entire fiscal headroom and left a £14bn hole in her figures.

Then you look at economic growth, which she has described as “the number one mission of this government”. Even in that statement there is a fundamental misunderstanding. Because it is not government that creates growth, it’s businesses.

Instead of supporting them, she has slapped huge taxes on them. Billions in National Insurance rises, huge hikes in Business Rates. Taxes that prevent businesses from actually investing in things that create growth.

At the same time, she spent her first six months in office talking down the UK economy for political gain. We have gone from the green shoots of recovery to the lowest level of business confidence on record outside of the pandemic, all since Labour have been in office.

The result of this were depressingly predictable. And yet, it genuinely seemed to take them by surprise when last week the OBR slashed this year’s growth forecasts in half.

She says she wants to get people off welfare and into work. But a combination of the National Insurance rises and Employments Rights Bill will mean there will be fewer jobs available, and businesses less willing to take a chance on people. According to the OBR, 160,000 fewer people are now expected to be in work this year.

On and on it goes. She says she wants to get more young people into employment and training. But she has made it £4,000 a year more expensive to hire an 18-year-old from April, and halved the number of apprenticeships available. There are now 100,000 more young people out of work, education and training since Labour took office.

Last week we saw in black and white every key economic indicator going in the wrong direction. It was as clear a rejection of Labour’s economic strategy as you are likely to see.

But instead of admitting that they have got it wrong, still they press on.</p>

According to The Information, Apple TV+ incurs annual losses of $1 billion (920 million euros).

The platform has become a major player in prestige television, but struggles with profitability. 

Severance, created by Dan Erickson and directed by Ben Stiller, has been a cultural phenomenon and the most-watched series on Apple TV+, generating over 200 million dollars in revenue.

However, this success does not reflect the overall performance of the platform, which reportedly loses 5,000 million dollars annually. 

The service has low capillarity, especially considering that there are more than 2 billion active Apple devices worldwide.

The Information figures provide context to a company that does not release financial metrics or subscriber numbers for Apple TV+.

Apple's services segment, which includes Apple Music and the App Store, is profitable, with benefits worth over $24 billion in the last quarter of 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DNA testing has become a valuable tool for hobbyists and novice genealogists. For some, learning they are the 10th cousin of Paul Revere or the 15th great nephew four times removed of the last King of Prussia is worth the perceived risk of sharing a DNA sample.

That was the question posed to millions of Americans last week when 23andMe, the company that popularized consumer genetic testing and had early backing from Google, filed for bankruptcy, leading to a wave of calls for Americans to delete their DNA from the company's database. While it's not 100 percent clear if the "delete your DNA" calls were warranted, privacy experts are alarmed.

According to data from online traffic analysis company Similarweb, on March 24, the day of the bankruptcy announcement, 23andMe received 1.5 million visits to its website, a 526% increase from one day prior. According to Similarweb, 376,000 visits were made to help pages specifically related to deleting data, and 30,000 were made to the customer care page for account closure.

Margaret Hu, professor of law and director of the Digital Democracy Lab at William & Mary Law School, thinks Americans made the right move. "This development is a disaster for data privacy," said Hu. In her view, the 23andMe bankruptcy should serve as a warning as to why the federal government needs strong data protection laws.

In some states, Hu noted, the government is taking an active role in counseling consumers. The California Attorney General's Office is urging Californians to delete their data and have 23andMe destroy saliva samples. But Hu says that is not enough, and such guidance should be provided to all U.S. citizens.

The potential national security implications of 23andMe's data falling into the wrong hands are not new. In fact, the Pentagon had previously warned military personnel that these DNA kits could pose a risk to national security. Exposing DNA collected from consumers is not a new issue for 23andMe, either.

In 2023, almost 7 million people who took the genetic test were already exposed in a major 23andMe data breach. The company signed an agreement that involved a $30 million settlement and a promise of three years' worth of security monitoring. But Hu says the bankruptcy does make the company, and its data, especially vulnerable now.

One of the things notable about the consumer mindset in the early years of the popularization of genetic testing was that a majority of users opted into sharing their DNA for research purposes, as much as 80% in the years when 23andMe was growing rapidly. Then, as the market for consumer sale of the popular DNA test kits reached saturation sooner than many expected, 23andMe focused more on research and development partnerships with drug companies as a way to diversify its revenue.

Currently, when 23andMe sells genetic data to other research companies, most is used at an aggregate level, as part of millions of data points being analyzed as a whole. The company also strips out identifying data from the genetic data, and no registration information (like a name or email) is included.</p>

WASHINGTON — 

President Donald Trump did not rule out the possibility of seeking a third term in the White House. He said in an exclusive interview with NBC News that there were methods for doing so and clarified that he was "not joking."

"A lot of people want me to do it," Trump said, referring to his allies. "But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it's very early in the administration." He added, "I'm focused on the current," and when asked whether he wanted another term, responded, "I like working."

Trump said, "I'm not joking. But I'm not — it is far too early to think about it." When asked whether he has been presented with plans to allow him to seek a third term, Trump said, "There are methods which you could do it."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump says Wednesday will be "Liberation Day" — a moment when he plans to roll out a set of tariffs that he promises will free the United States from foreign goods.

The details of Trump's next round of import taxes are still sketchy. Most economic analyses say average U.S. families would have to absorb the cost of his tariffs in the form of higher prices and lower incomes.

But an undeterred Trump is inviting CEOs to the White House to say they are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in new projects to avoid the import taxes.

It is also possible that the tariffs are short-lived if Trump feels he can cut a deal after imposing them. "I'm certainly open to it, if we can do something," Trump told reporters. "We'll get something for it."

At stake are family budgets, America's prominence as the world's leading financial power and the structure of the global economy.

Here's what you should know about the impending trade penalties:

He wants to announce import taxes, including "reciprocal" tariffs that would match the rates charged by other countries and account for other subsidies. Trump has talked about taxing the European Union, South Korea, Brazil and India, among other countries.

As he announced 25% auto tariffs last week, he alleged that America has been ripped off because it imports more goods than it exports. "This is the beginning of Liberation Day in America," Trump said.

"We're going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they've been taking over the years."

"They've taken so much out of our country, friend and foe. And, frankly, friend has been oftentimes much worse than foe." In an interview Saturday with NBC News, Trump said it did not bother him if tariffs caused vehicle prices to rise.

Because autos with more U.S. content could possibly be more competitively priced. "I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars," Trump said.

"I couldn't care less because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they're going to buy American cars." Trump has also suggested that he will be flexible with his tariffs, saying he will treat other nations better than they treated the United States.

But he still has plenty of other taxes coming on imports. The Republican president plans to tax imported pharmaceutical drugs, copper and lumber.

He has put forth a 25% tariff on any country that imports oil from Venezuela, even though the United States also does so. Imports from China are being charged an additional 20% tax because of its role in fentanyl production.

Trump has imposed separate tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico for the stated reason of stopping drug smuggling and illegal immigration.

Trump also expanded his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs to 25% on all imports. Some aides suggest the tariffs are tools for negotiation on trade and border security; others say the revenues will help reduce the federal budget deficit.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says they will force other nations to show Trump "respect."

Nothing good, according to most economists. They say average U.S. families would have to absorb the cost of his tariffs in the form of higher prices and lower incomes.

Most foreign leaders see the tariffs as destructive for the global economy, even if they are prepared to impose their own countermeasures. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Trump's tariff threats had ended the partnership between his country and the United States.

Canada already has announced retaliatory tariffs. French President Emmanuel Macron said the tariffs were "not coherent" and would mean "breaking value chains, creating inflation in the short term and destroying jobs."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. operation of TikTok Shop launched in 2023, and has attracted 47 million shoppers to the platform.

The social media-based marketplace combines the ultra-cheap price points of Temu with in-app social shopping, similar to Instagram and Facebook.

It added an estimated 11.9 million U.S. buyers in 2024 alone, placing it ahead of competitors like Meta and Pinterest in the same period, according to Emarketer.


TikTok Shop keeps buyers in its app, unlike other social shopping experiences that take shoppers to external websites to complete purchases.

Additionally, TikTok uses its algorithm to suggest products the same way it recommends content – it shows users advertisements based on their engagement habits, not just shopping habits.

Retail experts coin this marriage of shopping and entertainment as 'shoppertainment.' 

Congress in April 2024 passed a law requiring China's ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations to an American company or face an effective ban of the app stateside.

The concerns are that TikTok is a national security threat due to its ties to China, accusations that TikTok denies.

ByteDance has until April 5 to find a U.S. buyer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daisy Hernandez used credit card points to fund a 2024 trip to Iceland with her mom and grandmother.

Daisy Hernandez has been a credit cards editor at The Points Guy since 2023, but has taken joy in gamifying credit card rewards for much longer. Like many of her colleagues, she spreads her spending across multiple cards to maximize rewards such as airline miles, hotel points and cash back. In January 2024, she opened a Chase Sapphire Reserve card.

By May, Hernandez had accumulated more than 100,000 points, which she put toward a trip for all three of them. By The Points Guy's estimates, each Chase Ultimate Rewards point is worth roughly 2.05 cents, making her stash worth just over $2,000.

She chose a card strategically

Hernandez wanted a premium travel card and narrowed things down to two main options. To choose between them she looked at rewards points and transfer partners, among other factors. The Chase card worked with her "favorite hotel chain," it turned out.

She was wise with her rewards

Hernandez's card offers a baseline one point for every dollar spent on the card and three points on travel and dining, plus increased values for purchases made through the Chase travel portal. Over the course of about five months, she was able to rack up just over 100,000 points.

She didn't let perfect be the enemy of good


Hernandez used some 23,000 points — about $470 by TPG's estimates — to rent a car for four days. She used around the same amount to book her flight, which came with a face value of roughly $450. Her 100,000 points didn't cover everything.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every parent hopes their child will grow up and still want a close relationship with them. But close bonds don't happen by accident — they are built through small, everyday interactions that make a child feel safe, seen and valued.

As a conscious parenting researcher and coach, I've studied over 200 families. I've found that the way you respond to your children from the day they're born determines how strong your relationship with them is when they're adults.

Children need to feel safe and comfortable sharing their feelings. But when they hear "you're fine" or "it's not a big deal," they start believing that their feelings aren't important and eventually stop sharing them.

Instead of dismissing emotions, acknowledge them. To help them feel heard, say things like: "That sounds frustrating" or "I see you're upset." Emotional safety isn't about fixing problems — it's about making sure they feel understood.

Parenting based on fear, punishment or constant correction creates distance. Kids will then learn to hide parts of themselves to avoid disappointing you. Parents who remain close with their children don't demand obedience.

Instead, they prioritize building trust. Simple moments — laughing together, listening without judgment, showing empathy — help children feel safe. When kids feel emotionally secure, they continue seeking your support well into adulthood.

When parents make all the decisions, kids start to think: My actions don't matter anyway, so why have an opinion on anything? Instead of deciding everything for them, ask "What do you think?" or "What feels right to you?"

Let them make small, age-appropriate choices, like picking their clothes, hobbies or what to eat. Apologizing teaches kids that respect goes both ways. Saying, "I overreacted earlier, and I'm sorry" shows them that relationships aren't about power, but mutual understanding.

Children raised in homes where accountability is the norm don't fear making mistakes. Instead of hiding their struggles, they trust they can come to you without shame.

A strong relationship isn't built in one big conversation — it's created through small, consistent moments. What shapes your bond isn't just the time you spend together, but how often your child feels prioritized.

Sharing a meal, reading at bedtime or simply checking in about their day strengthens the bond. Kids who feel valued in small ways will naturally stay close to you later in life.

If a child feels constantly compared or judged, they start shrinking themselves to fit in. Over time, they learn to hide their real thoughts, interests and struggles.

Helping kids accept themselves starts with how you respond to them. Instead of pointing out flaws, celebrate their uniqueness. Encouraging their interests, even when they don't align with your expectations, lets them know that you love them exactly as they are.

When kids grow up feeling accepted, they won't have to choose between being themselves and staying close to you.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The top-performing U.S. stock in Berkshire Hathaway's enormous equity portfolio this year is VeriSign, which provides a dotcom domain registry service.

VeriSign has seen its shares climb more than 21% this year and over 32% over the past 12 months.

Berkshire first bought VeriSign stock in the fourth quarter of 2012, shortly after Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett hired Ted Weschler as his investing lieutenant.

The conglomerate left the size of the position virtually unchanged from 2014 until 2024, when it raised it slightly, to 14%.

VeriSign largely manages the domain-name registries for two of the internet's most valuable domains, .com and .net.

Its sales primarily come from businesses and individuals obtaining and renewing a specific domain name.

Bespoke Investment Group compared VeriSign to a utility stock, saying " $VRSN is like a Utility stock for the Internet. They run the .com and .net handles, and they get paid every time someone buys a new domain or renews a domain."

VeriSign shares took off after a regulatory overhang was resolved when the Biden administration renewed a federal contract with the company.

The Wall Street firm Citigroup has a buy rating on the stock, citing its attractive risk/reward for investors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The HBO series "The White Lotus" explores the dynamic of friends on vacation, revealing the potential for damaging relationships.

In its third season, the show follows three middle-aged women taking a trip to recapture their childhood bonds, only to discover they have little in common.

They fight and gossip while at a luxury resort, highlighting the strain vacations can put on friendships.

If you've ever traveled with friends, you may know how vacations can cause tension and conflict.

However, by doing some vetting beforehand, you can avoid damaging relationships by identifying which friends to travel with.

Here are three red flags that indicate you and your friend might not travel well together.

1. You have different budgets

Christie Tate took a trip from Chicago to San Francisco with a friend who had "a lot more resources." 

The friction started before they arrived, as the friend flew first class while Tate opted for economy.

Their hotel was also out of Tate's budget, leading to discussions about money that became increasingly uncomfortable. 

Tate felt like her friend was shaming her for not spending more.

Spending became a pain point throughout the trip, with the pair needing to discuss how much they were willing to spend on transit, meals, and excursions.

Elaine Glusac advised discussing budget allocation across variables like dining and entertainment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Dow Jones Industrial Average had a difficult beginning in 2025, but analysts are optimistic about certain stocks heading into the second quarter.

The 30-stock Dow has tumbled more than 2% in the first quarter, with chip giant Nvidia leading the decline at an 18% fall. Nike and Apple followed with losses of more than 16% and roughly 13%, respectively.

The broader market has sold off due to concerns about President Donald Trump's tariffs potentially weakening economic growth and increasing inflation.

CNBC Pro screened for Dow stocks that analysts are feeling most bullish about, using the following criteria: have buy ratings from at least 55% of analysts covering the stock and see upside of 20% or more to the average price target.

Despite Nvidia's sell-off, analysts think the stock has rebound potential, with nearly 80% of those covering it rating it a buy. The average price target implies shares gaining about 53% from their current levels.

Bank of America said the recent pullback presents a prime buying point for exposure to the artificial intelligence giant.

Microsoft is another megacap tech name analysts foresee climbing in the second quarter, with analysts polled by FactSet estimating the stock gaining nearly 30% from current levels.

The majority of analysts also hold a buy rating on shares. Jefferies recently reiterated the stock as one of its favorite names to hold.

Shares are down more than 10% in the first quarter.

Disney made the cut, with more than half the analysts who watch the stock rating it a buy and seeing shares advancing about 26% from current levels.

The company has come under pressure after reporting streaming subscriber losses in its Disney+ division during its fiscal first-quarter earnings report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JPMorgan has called the bottom in the Chinese consumer slump, and the firm says now it's time to buy.

 
Chinese consumers have been reluctant to spend since the Covid-19 pandemic. Retail sales rose by just 3.5% last year, less than half the average of 9.7% in the years 2015 to 2019. But on March 26, JPMorgan's China equity strategists upgraded consumer discretionary stocks to overweight from neutral.

 
JPMorgan's chief Asia and China equity strategist Wendy Liu and a team said in the report that their analytics show that China's business cycle for consumption has been bottoming out. They pointed out drivers such as recent trade-in policies, stabilizing stock and property prices, and moderating deflationary pressure due to base effects.

 
The latest earnings results from Chinese companies signal some recovery in consumer spending, albeit still far from pre-pandemic levels except in some niche categories such as gold and popular toys. The JPMorgan analysts expect that in coming weeks, Chinese stocks may rise on better-than-expected earnings growth and increased forecasts.

 
Their China consumer stock picks focus on sub-sectors with fundamental improvements and reasonable valuations. Here are their China consumer plays: Anta Sports reported better-than-expected retail sales in February with less of a need for discounting products.

 
Anta owns the rights to Italian brand Fila in China. Mengniu is expected to benefit from China's efforts to boost the birth rate. Hohhot this month announced subsidies of up to 100,000 yuan per child.

 
Mengniu reported a 10.1% drop in 2024 revenue in the face of "intensified pricing competition," according to an annual report released Wednesday. China Resources Beer reported sales of the premium beer grew by nearly 20% in 2024 despite a high base the prior year.

 
Tal Education currently operates at a loss, but its margins are set to improve as Tal sells significantly more artificial intelligence-powered educational devices in the next two years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google searches for "how to reduce stress" are at an all-time high.

"I'm actually hearing from a lot of my own patients that they can't remember the last time that they were this stressed and unable to see an end in sight," says Dr. Neha Chaudhary, a double board-certified child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist.

"The spike in Google searches for how to manage stress isn't just digital noise," she says. "It's a population-level cry for help."

Chaudhary, who is the chief medical officer of Modern Health, says contributing factors include the economy, the political climate, climate change and feeling "bombarded by information with very little escape."

People who feel overwhelmed by what's happening nationally and globally still have to handle the daily responsibilities in their personal lives. Even positive life changes, like having a baby, getting a promotion or planning a wedding, can take a toll.

But Chaudhary says there is one positive takeaway from this trend: "The increase in searches today is also a sign that people might be more aware of their mental health, and are actively looking for ways to take control of it."

Here are some practical ways that Chaudhary and Kathryn Smerling, a psychotherapist, suggest reducing stress and improving your overall mental health.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kathleen Nolan has seen the ups and downs of the job market in her seven years as a recruiter, during which she estimates she's interviewed thousands and hired hundreds.

She could post an open role on a Thursday night and "easily wake up to 400 applications on a Friday morning," just hours later, she tells CNBC Make It. 

People are definitely applying more, and I would say they are applying more aggressively," Nolan says. "So when they see an open role, they're jumping on it."

As candidates stress about low hiring, mass layoffs and a potential recession, Nolan says she often has to console job seekers about the realities of the market.

We are not in what I would consider to be a normal market," Nolan says. "But of course, there are things we can do to put ourselves in the best possible light."

The following are four tried-and-true pieces of advice that work in a normal job market and, despite today's cut-throat landscape, can still help candidates stand out, Nolan says.

Make your resume outcomes-based

Recruiters often review hundreds of applications a day, so Nolan says it's crucial to get your point across quickly and effectively.

I love to see actionable outcomes," she says. "I love to see not just how long you worked somewhere and what your job title was, but really, what did you do? What are some projects you're proud of?

What are some things that you initiated or took the lead on?" 

What's more, she says her most recent new hires all show a strong skill set and experience match with the new job.

If you can demonstrate on your resume that you've done the job you're applying to before, or that your experience directly translates to what the new job will be, make sure that's front and center.

Show off your personal branding on LinkedIn

Make sure your online professional presence makes a statement, Nolan says.

Applicants stand out when they have "any kind of personal branding, whether it's a portfolio, a website, anything that you are putting out there in the world that says, 'This is who I am.'"

Personalize your LinkedIn or other online website "to showcase you to the best of your abilities."

Include an up-to-date photo to show you're a real person, Nolan adds, and follow companies you're interested in on LinkedIn.

Engaging with their content, networking with employees — it can create visibility before you apply.

Network for referrals

Connections matter, maybe now more than ever. 

A referral is always going to be your best way in," Nolan says.

If you have a friend who works with a company, if you know a hiring manager, if you know anyone who can provide some sort of warm introduction, it is a pretty surefire way of getting at least a toe in the door, if not your entire foot."

The best thing to do is proactively build and nurture relationships before you ever need something.

To that end, stay active on LinkedIn, attend industry events and check out alumni groups.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE PHOTO: An "Open House" sign outside of a home in Washington, DC, US, on Sunday, Nov. 19, 2023.

When Maryland Governor Wes Moore was 8 years old, his mother told him she wanted to send him to military school to correct his behavior. Yet it wasn't until he was 13 that she finally did send him to a military school in Pennsylvania. He ran away five times in the first four days.

"That place ended up really helping me change my life," said Moore while speaking about retirement security at a BlackRock conference in Washington, D.C., on March 12. One obstacle — the tuition costs — prevented his mother from sending him sooner, he said.

Moore was able to attend the school thanks to help from his grandparents, who borrowed against the home they bought when they immigrated to the U.S., to help pay for the first year's tuition. "They ended up sacrificing part of their American dream so I could achieve my own," Moore said.

"That's what housing helps provide," Moore said. "It's not just shelter. It's security; it's an investment. It's a chance you can tap into something if an emergency happens. It's a chance that you now have an asset that you can hold onto, and you can pass off to future generations."

After retirement funds, housing generally represents the second-most-valuable asset people have, Moore said.

Some now less likely to own homes than in 1980

Yet achieving that homeownership status can feel unattainable to prospective first-time buyers in today's economy. Around 30% of young Maryland residents are thinking of leaving the state because of high housing costs, Moore said.

Both renters and homeowners across the U.S. are struggling with high housing costs, according to a 2024 report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. The number of cost-burdened renters — meaning those who spend more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities — climbed to an all-time high in 2022.

At the same time, millions of prospective homebuyers have been priced out by high home prices and interest rates. Many hopeful first-time home buyers may feel that it was easier for their parents and grandparents' generations to reach home ownership status.

Research shows those feelings are justified. Since 1980, median home prices have increased much faster than median household incomes, according to recent research from the Urban Institute.

Across the country, today's 35- to 44-years olds — who are in their critical homebuying years — are less likely to be homeowners than in 1980, according to the research. For that age cohort, the homeownership rate has dropped by more than 10% compared to 45 years ago, the Urban Institute found.

Because today's 35- to 44-year-olds are also forming households at a lower rate, that number is likely understated, according to the research.

Ultimately, that can have lasting impacts on their ability to build wealth, said Jun Zhu, a non-resident fellow at the Urban Institute's Housing Finance Policy Center. "When you have a house, when the house appreciates, you're going to earn home equity," Zhu said.

Earning home equity is actually a very important way to earn wealth. Those 35- to 44-year-olds who are in lower income quartiles have seen the biggest declines in homeownership compared to their peers.

That is driven in part by the fact that people who are married are more likely to be homeowners, while lower-income individuals are less likely to be married. Education is also a factor in widening the homeownership gap, according to the Urban Institute, as a smaller share of heads of households who have the lowest incomes are getting college degrees.

Racial divide in homeownership rates persists</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Angeles pulled off a rare feat in 1984: the city turned a profit on the Summer Olympics.

It's looking like that may not be easy in 2028. And that could come at a bad time for the city. "The city of L.A., financially, we are in trouble," Controller Kenneth Mejia wrote in a recent letter to Mayor Karen Bass and the City Council.

Los Angeles is "overspending" by $300 million, Meija wrote. A top city budget official recently estimated that the budget shortfall could reach $1 billion in its next fiscal year.

Last week, state lawmakers requested another $1.9 billion in funding, after receiving $2.5 billion, to help with the city's recovery efforts from the January wildfires.

LA28 has a $6.9 billion budget funded by corporate sponsorships, licensing agreements, and a significant contribution from the International Olympic Committee.

The budget covers expenses like renting athletic arenas, personnel costs, as well as housing athletes. But if the Olympics budget math doesn't add up exactly as planned, taxpayers could be left paying part of the bill, and LA and its Olympics committee are aware of the risks of overrunning cost estimates.

In 2019, LA28's budget was increased by $1.36 billion. If LA28's budget still doesn't prove to be enough, the City of Los Angeles will be responsible for the next $270 million in funding.

After that, California's state government will be responsible for the next $270 million — with the next $270 million after that again becoming LA's financial burden.

Olympics' host cities have a long history of financial failure. In the last 60 years of host cities, almost none have been profitable or stayed on budget.

The 2000 Sydney Olympic Games in Australia ended up 90% over budget after spending over $5 billion. The 2004 Athens Olympic Games ended up roughly 50% over budget, at $3 billion, due to overruns and growing debt.

The 2016 Summer Olympic Games cost Rio de Janeiro a reported $20 billion. The Olympics have been so unprofitable that when London broke even in 2012, it was considered a success.

Miles away from financial disaster, Los Angeles is set to host the 2028 Olympics. But experts warn that LA's financial stress could be an issue for the Games. 

LA's fiscal stress could not come at a worse time given the wildfires. "We've gone from record levels of General Fund reserves 18 months ago to the brink of needing to officially declare a 'fiscal emergency,'" he said.

"While wildfires are not an uncommon occurrence in California, the scale of the destruction to homes, business, and public infrastructure is considerably higher than the LA area usually experiences," Matthew Burbank said.

It may take several years for Los Angeles to rebuild, but Burbank said he does not expect the wildfires to have a direct impact on Olympics' planning.

"There is no denying a multi-year wildfire rebuilding effort's overall impact on the public financial situation. There may be lasting impacts on state and local government budgets that will be ongoing in 2028 and beyond," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With one more trading day left in March, Wall Street is poised to turn in terrible monthly and quarterly declines after another terrible week. Economic and inflation uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's tariffs — both implemented and threatened — are largely to blame.

Cracks in the AI trade were also a factor, with the latest knock coming from CoreWeave's scaled-down initial public offering that also priced below expectations at $40. Shares of the company, which rents Nvidia chips to customers for artificial intelligence workloads, opened at $39 in Friday's debut.

The stock traded as high as $41.92 but closed unchanged at $40. CoreWeave was the biggest U.S. tech IPO since 2021.

Friday's ugly session — driven by a hotter-than-expected inflation reading and broad tech stock weakness — pushed the S&P 500 down 1.5% and Nasdaq down 2.6% for the entire week.

The S&P 500 teetered on the edge of going back into correction territory, as measured by a decline of 10% or more from its most recent high. The Nasdaq dipped further into correction, now down almost 14.3% since its recent high.

As of Friday's close, the S&P 500 slid nearly 6.3% in March, while the Nasdaq sank 8.1%. Both were tracking for their worst monthly performances since late 2022.

Looking at the first quarter to date, the S&P 500 dropped 5.1% while the Nasdaq plunged 10.3%.

Both are on pace to break their five-quarter winnings streaks and turn in their worst quarters since early 2022.

There are no Club names reporting earnings this week — and it's going to be a quiet week for quarterly reports overall before we start hearing from the banks in the middle of April.

However, developments on tariffs and a slew of jobs data are the two things to watch in the week ahead.

1. Tariffs: It's a big week: Wednesday, April 2, is the day Trump said reciprocal tariffs would go into effect. These are tariffs against U.S. trading partners that put levies on American imports coming into their countries.

There has been some jockeying ahead of the deadline, with the president himself indicating last week there may be some room to negotiate.

Bloomberg reported that the European Union is looking at concessions it could make.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Companies are rebranding their diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts due to backlash from Washington.

As part of this trend, Amazon has pulled back on DEI programs. The company halted some initiatives in December as part of a broader review. It eliminated references to inclusion and diversity in its annual report while altering a website to remove sections titled "Equity for Black people" and "LGBTQ+ rights." CEO Andy Jassy characterized the eliminations as being part of Amazon's ongoing cost-cutting efforts.

Amazon began evaluating its DEI programs "a couple years ago," Jassy said. "We had about 300 programs." The company realized there were several where they weren't getting enough value out of them and those programs were streamlined. In areas with a real impact, they doubled down on initiatives.

Companies are shifting away from diversity reports, which tracked hiring based on different genders and ethnicities, and focusing instead on tracking the rates at which promotions and attrition happen, according to experts. They are also changing how candidates apply for programs, such as by writing an essay about their background rather than simply checking a box indicating their ethnicity.

Experts say they've yet to lose any clients as a result of the DEI backlash. Instead, organizations will be forced to be more thoughtful about their plans and do away with "performative" aspects of DEI that did little to move the needle. This includes actions such as signaling support for social media movements without meaningful action.

Companies are rebranding their diversity efforts, but experts say recent studies show this type of work remains popular among workers and companies. Pew Research in 2023 found that 86% of workers have a neutral-to-favorable opinion about increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace.</p>

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said he was "very angry" and "pissed off" when Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized the credibility of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's leadership, adding that the comments were "not going in the right location."

Agence France-Presse reported that Putin on Friday called for a transitional government to be put in place in Ukraine, which could effectively push out Zelenskyy.

President Trump said, "If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault — which it might not be — but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia."

"That would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can't do business in the United States," Trump said. "There will be a 25% tariff on all oil, a 25- to 50-point tariff on all oil."

The president's comments come after he had previously criticized Zelenskyy, saying he was "sick" of his handling of the war and falsely calling him a dictator.

Trump said, "There will be a 25% tariff on oil and other products sold in the United States, secondary tariffs," Trump said, noting that the tariffs on Russia would come within a month without a ceasefire deal.

Trump also threatened "bombing" and "secondary tariffs" on Iran if the country did not make a deal with the U.S. to ensure it did not develop a nuclear weapon.

"If they don't make a deal," Trump said about Iran, "there will be bombing. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before."

U.S. and Iranian officials are "talking," Trump said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CoreWeave has filed to go public, seeking to raise $2.3 billion in debt led by private equity firm Blackstone and hedge fund Magnetar.

 
The company's business model involves providing computing resources to other companies, using Nvidia GPUs as its primary technology platform.

It has signed a five-year deal with OpenAI valued at nearly $12 billion, which will represent less than half of expected future committed contract revenue, down from 62% of total sales last year.

CoreWeave's relationship with Nvidia is described as "symbiotic," with the two companies depending on each other to deliver performant configurations of their infrastructure.

However, the company also relies heavily on Nvidia for its GPUs, and has posted them as collateral for its debt financing.

In 2023, CoreWeave raised $2.3 billion in debt, led by Blackstone and Magnetar, at an actual interest rate above 14%.

The company obtained over $7 billion in additional debt last year from the same investors, borrowing at a rate of about 11%.

CoreWeave's prospectus describes its financing methods as "innovative," but notes that they come at a high cost.

Analysts at DA Davidson predict that CoreWeave accounts for 6% to 8% of Nvidia's revenue.

Michael Kellner, a communications executive who represented the startup at public relations agency Treble, said that the moment when Microsoft agreed to rent GPUs through CoreWeave was "the moment where CoreWeave came into the collective consciousness."

The OpenAI deal has helped increase CoreWeave's visibility and credibility in the market.

Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, praised CoreWeave for its help in building large-scale computing clusters that led to the creation of some of the models that OpenAI is best known for.</p>

The toll from Myanmar's earthquake continued to rise on Sunday, as foreign rescue teams and aid rushed into the impoverished country, where hospitals were overwhelmed and some communities scrambled to mount rescue efforts with limited resources.


The 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmar's strongest in a century, jolted the war-torn Southeast Asian nation on Friday, leaving around 1,700 people dead, 3,400 injured and over 300 missing as of Sunday, the military government said.

India, China and Thailand are among Myanmar's neighbours that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.


The destruction has been extensive, and humanitarian needs are growing by the hour," the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement.

Critical infrastructure - including bridges, highways, airports and railways - across the country of 55 million lie damaged, slowing humanitarian efforts while the conflict that has battered the economy, displaced over 3.5 million people and debilitated the health system rages on.


In some areas near the epicentre, residents told Reuters that government assistance was scarce, leaving people to fend for themselves.

"It is necessary to restore the transportation routes as soon as possible," Min Aung Hlaing told officials on Saturday, according to state media. "It is necessary to fix the railways and also reopen the airports so that rescue operations would be more effective."</p>

一方、イーロン・マスク氏率いるテスラは、高価なLiDARセンサーを搭載せずとも光学カメラのみで自動運転車を大規模展開することができるとの立場だ。

コストの観点からLiDARセンサーを不要とするテスラの主張に、クラフチック氏はこう反論する。

「LiDARを含むロバストなセンサー群のコストは、1マイル当たりで考えれば微々たるもの。（測定データを使った）3Dマッピングのコストは言わずもがな。人的被害の削減という観点で測定される安全面のメリットは重大かつ検証可能なものです」

ウェイモに競合相手はいない

2021年4月にウェイモを離れ、現在はロバート・J・スカリンジ氏率いるリビアン（Rivian）の取締役を務めるクラフチック氏は、米中両国はじめ複数の企業が自動運転車を使った配車サービスを世界中で開発・展開しているものの、ウェイモの独走状態に変化はないと断言する。

中国のバイドゥ（Baidu、百度）が展開するロボタクシーサービス「アポロ・ゴー（Apollo Go）」は2024年第4四半期だけでおよそ110万回の配車実績を記録した。

アマゾン（Amazon）が2020年6月に買収したズークス（Zoox）は目下、カリフォルニア州サンフランシスコとネバダ州ラスベガスで試験走行を積み重ねており、2025年下半期にも商業運行を開始する計画だ。

テスラも前出のサイバーキャブを使った配車サービスをテキサス州オースティンで6月に開始する（とマスク氏が公言している）。

一方のウェイモはカリフォルニア州ロサンゼルス、サンフランシスコ、アリゾナ州フェニックスでロボタクシーサービス「ウェイモ・ワン（Waymo One）」を展開し、配車実績はすでに週20万回以上に及んでいる。

オースティンやジョージア州アトランタでも配車サービス大手ウーバー（Uber）と提携して自動運転サービスを提供しており、さらに米国外での初展開に向けて東京でも走行試験に乗り出している。

「現時点で言えば、ウェイモに競合相手はいません」

そう語るクラフチック氏によれば、ウェイモはサービス規模、安全性、性能の観点で圧倒的な優位性を誇り、今後3〜5年は他社に追いつかれそうにないという。

「あらゆる車両に統合可能な、免許証を有する人間の運転を代行するエンボディード（身体性をもって物理世界と相互作用する）AIの社会実装に成功、なおかつサードパーティーのデータを用いてその規模を拡大し、運転能力と安全性について人間のドライバーに対する顕著な優位性を実証した唯一の企業がウェイモなのです」

またズークスに関して、クラフチック氏は「大きな期待」を寄せており、「市場参入に向けた慎重かつ入念な取り組み」を高く評価した。ただし、そのサービス運営規模は2018年にウェイモが初めてロボタクシーを展開した時に比べると見劣りするという。

さらに、中国企業についてクラフチック氏は具体名には言及しなかったものの、（中国国内より当局による規制が厳格と見られる）米国内でのサービス展開に至っていないことを踏まえ、ウェイモ並みの自動運転性能を実現できているとは考えにくいと指摘する。

例えば、トヨタ自動車の大規模出資先で2024年11月に米ナスダック上場を果たしたポニー・エーアイ（Pony.ai、小馬智行）は、カリフォルニア州で試験運転中に交通違反を複数回繰り返し、2022年5月に同州自動車局から無人運転の許可を取り消されている。

配車サービスは「最終目的地」ではない

クラフチック氏によれば、ウェイモは当初から配車サービスの実現だけを目指してきたわけではなく、現在も「ウェイモの自動運転車への（優先的もしくは無制限の）アクセスを保証する」サブスクリプションサービスや、大型トラックもしくは自家用車にもデプロイ可能な自動運転ソフトウェアの製品化まで見据えているという。

そうした大きな成長余地を踏まえて、アナリストの中にはウェイモの新規株式公開（IPO）や親会社アルファベット（Alphabet）からのスピンアウトを予想する向きもある。

資産運用会社ディープウォーター・アセット・マネジメント（Deepwater Asset Management）のジーン・マンスター氏は2024年11月、ウェイモが2〜4年以内にアルファベットからスピンアウトし、2030年には評価額3500億〜8500億ドルの巨大企業（OpenAIの最新評価額が3000億ドル）に成長するとの見通しを語っている。

ただ、ウェイモが2016年にアルファベットの独立子会社として分社化を果たした時の経営トップであるクラフチック氏は確信を持ってこう語る。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>シリング教授はマスク氏のキャリアおよび同氏の経営する企業を研究テーマとしており、そこに共通して確認できる要素として「不安ないし不確実な感覚」を挙げる。

「ブランドの核となる人物の立ち位置としては非常に危ういものです」

就寝の準備時間に参加必須の全社ミーティングを設定すれば、従業員の士気は下がるだろう。

また、従業員の時間は（会社のためにいつでも提供させられるという意味で）無価値との誤ったシグナルを発することで「信頼関係を決定的に毀損」（シリング教授）しかねない。

起業して間もない成長期、初期段階なら、企業として定めた基準や規範を無視して（深夜や週末の作業になりふり構わず取り組むなど）無理を通すこともあるかもしれない。しかしテスラはとうにそうした時期を過ぎている。

「マスク氏はすでにその行動が多くの人々に影響を及ぼし、多くの人々を巻き込む可能性のある存在であり、もはや少年時代の悪ふざけでは済まないのです」

マスク氏はこれまで疑問視されるような問題発言・行動をたびたび繰り返してきたが、なぜか好意的に解釈されて特に深刻な咎（とが）めを受けずにきた。

それでも、テスラの株価が12月に更新した史上最高値から80％下落（3月24日終値時点で42％）するといった深刻な危機に対処せねばならなくなった場合、さすがの熱狂的マスク氏支持者らも寛容ではいられないというのがシュローター氏の見方だ。

過去にはオフィスの床で寝泊まり

マスク氏の仕事に向き合う姿勢が注目を浴びるのは今回が初めてではない。

ミッドサイズ電動セダン『モデル3』の生産遅延からテスラが「地獄」を味わっていた2018年春、マスク氏は工場に泊まり込んで床で寝ていたと公言している。

さらに、2022年10月に買収したツイッター（Twitter、現X）の経営改革を進めていた時期も、自らサンフランシスコ本社のソファで寝泊まりするだけでなく、従業員にも「ハードコア」な働き方を求め、実際に管理職クラスのエンジニアがオフィスの床で寝ている様子が撮影されている。

創業者らしく何でも派手にやるのがマスク流の経営とは言え、就寝時間前の全社ミーティングは準備不足ないし（多忙さにかまけて）会社の有事に気づくのが遅れた事実をさらけ出しただけにすぎない、と前出のシュローター氏はにべもない。

ただ、3月20日深夜の全社ミーティングでマスク氏が発したメッセージは投資家にはそれなりに響いたようで、結果的に翌21日、さらに週明け24日の株価は大きな回復ぶりを示した。

なお、マスク氏がそのミーティングで語ったことを端的に要約すれば、ロボットタクシー「サイバーキャブ（Cybercab）」や人間型ロボット「オプティマス（Optimus）」の市場投入を前に、投資家はテスラ株を「絶対手放すべきではない」ということだった。

カオスな何かを期待する心理

ベストセラー『ロングゲーム』の著者でコロンビア大学ビジネススクールでも教鞭を執るドリー・クラーク氏は、テスラ以外の企業なら従業員が眉をひそめたり不安を抱いたりするであろう突然の深夜ミーティングをなぜかマスク氏が開催できてしまうのは、ほとんどの人が「カオス感があって」型破りな何かを彼に期待しているからだと分析する。

「何しろ、マスク氏は（全米で人気のポッドキャスト番組）ジョー・ローガン・エクスペリエンスでマリファナを吸った人物です」

マスク氏はもともと場当たり的で、感情に左右される経営者として知られ、そういう認識が定着しているゆえに、予測不能で一貫性のない行動も「あえて懸念するほどのことではない」といった受け止めに終始するところがある、とクラーク氏は語る。

そうした現実の文脈を踏まえると、深夜の無茶なミーティングはむしろ、マスク氏がこれまでと変わらず会社の経営を深く気にかけているという従業員へのメッセージと受け止められた可能性もある。

そして、仮にそうだとしても、テスラが抱える課題の解消に向けて具体的に取り組んでいることを示すさらなる行動が後に続かなければ、従業員と投資家のポジティブなセンチメントを維持するのは難しいとクラーク氏は指摘する。

スティーブ・ジョブズ「崇拝」と同じ

前出のシュローター氏も、マスク氏が全社ミーティングを開いて従業員に直接訴えた判断は、一斉メールを送信したり従業員コミュニケーションを担当するチームに一任したりするよりずっと効果的だったと語る。

「たとえビデオ会議だったとしても、従業員の前に姿を見せて語りかけ、感情を見せるだけで全く結果は異なるものになります。経営者も従業員と同じ懸念を共有しているんだと示す効果があるのです」

ただし、そうした方法がどのくらい深く響くかは、従業員側にどの程度「火中の栗を拾う」覚悟があるか次第だという。

アップル（Apple）共同創業者のスティーブ・ジョブズ氏と同じくらい、テスラ従業員のマスク氏に対する忠誠心は高く、長時間労働も含めて何としてでも高い期待に応えようとするだろう、シュローター氏はそう語る。

「イーロン・マスクの存在は唯一のもの。別に私自身が彼を崇拝しているからそう言うのではありません。目の前の事実をありのままに言えばそういうことになるのです」

実際、マスク氏はさまざまな問題が生じても、たいてい従業員の信頼をつなぎ留めて結果を残している。一方で「経営者の99.9％」はマスク氏ほど多くの貢献を従業員に求めることはできないとシュローター氏は結論する。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Major players in the ETF space, including JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, are making bets that private strategies will continue to see greater adoption by Main Street investors.

In the midst of a market correction and uncertainty about the outlook for U.S. stocks and the global economy, these companies are looking at an incredible amount of demand from ETF investors who want access to alternative investment funds.


The head of BNY Mellon's ETF business, Ben Slavin, said that managers are looking to push more into the wealth space to tap into growth and meet investors where they are. While mutual funds still make sense for retirement accounts, interval funds have been successful in allowing for access to private credit.


BlackRock acquired a provider of alternative investments research last year, Preqin, and plans "more indexing of private investments." The SEC recently approved the first private credit ETF.

Lack of liquidity in private markets is a key issue for ETFs to solve as they attempt to grow the alternative investment side of the business. These kinds of funds have traditionally been illiquid but because of innovation in the ETF industry, more people are gaining access.


Another trend catching on within the ETF market amid volatility in stocks is active ETFs designed to offer downside protection while capitalizing on income gained from selling call options.</p>
