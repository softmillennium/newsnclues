“Across all the different strategies and implementations, I anticipate that by 2030, a quarter of the S&P 500 will have BTC somewhere on their balance sheets as a long-term asset,” Elliot Chun, a partner at Architect Partners, wrote in a market snapshot.

The strategy—holding bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset—was unorthodox when Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, first adopted it in August 2020. The firm framed BTC as a hedge against inflation, a diversification tool, and a way to distinguish itself in the market.

Then CEO Michael Saylor’s highly public embrace of bitcoin transformed the company into a de facto proxy for BTC exposure. Since then, MicroStrategy stock has surged more than 2,000%, far outpacing both the S&P 500 and bitcoin over the same period, Chun pointed out.

GameStop is the latest company to follow suit, announcing this week that it would raise $1.3 billion through a convertible note to acquire bitcoin. Its stock initially surged following the announcement but has since endured a correction, falling nearly 15% for the week.

Chun argued that treasurers may soon face career risk not for buying bitcoin, but for ignoring it altogether. “Doing nothing is no longer a defensible strategy,” he wrote.

According to BitcoinTreasuries data, publicly listed companies currently hold 665,618 BTC, around 3.17% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. Strategy holds the lion’s share, 506,137 BTC.

Based on the total percent return since 2010, April has brought in an average 27% return for bitcoin, marking it the third-best month, according to Barchart data. November and May were the other two months with the highest returns, with about 38% and 26% gains, respectively.

""Seasonality factors are not as reliable as standalone indicators, but when coupled with other signs, such as the recent halt in selling by long-term holders, they appear credible,"" Godbole wrote.

One cog in the wheel may be the defunct exchange Mt. Gox's transfer of a significant amount of bitcoin to the centralized exchange's wallets, which could create fear of creditors' liquidations.

""A potential short-term risk is Mt. Gox, which has been transferring sizable amounts of BTC to Kraken—this may lead to temporary selling pressure or market volatility,"" said Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers.

Smoke from Nicaraguan cigars choked out the room as a heavy-set Bitcoin miner from the Deep South explained how the industry was expanding at an exponential rate.

""You have no idea,"" he said at this year's Mining Disrupt pre-party in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, before following up with the common Bitcoiner maxim—repeated by President Trump on the campaign trail—that you should never sell your stash.

Having been involved in the space since the early days, he recalled buying a Ferrari with orange coins years ago, which he said—with a laugh—he now regretted following the asset's stratospheric rise.

Bitcoin hasn't stopped climbing over the years and surged to new highs off the back of President Trump's November victory. The new commander in chief promised during his campaign that he'd help the industry after regulators cracked down hard on crypto companies during ex-President Joe Biden's tenure.

Some of the resulting optimism shined through at the event. However, there was also gloominess at the world's biggest crypto mining expo this week, as those in the fast-moving and arcane industry admitted that they struggled to make ends meet in the increasingly competitive and high-cost world of Bitcoin mining.

Case in point: The price of Bitcoin is now down by 24% from its January all-time high, and trading hands for under $83,000. But mining difficulty has continued to surge to new records—and fast.

""It's just so hard to keep up,"" said one man with a small business in the cutthroat trade who asked not to be named. He quickly changed topics to talk about his Solana-based side hustle.

Weathering challenges

Mining Bitcoin is a convoluted, yet topical sphere in the crypto industry. Conceptually, people sort of get why it's important for the space—President Trump even spoke about how vital it was to protect the business—but it's too technical for many to wrap their heads around.

Even crypto people.

But the short of it is this: mining Bitcoin requires a lot of resources—namely cheap energy—to satiate loud, powerful machines that keep the payment network in check. Miners, which are typically large industrial operations, receive newly minted digital coins when they process a block on the blockchain.

As the network has grown—as it is supposed to—mining difficulty goes up. And it takes more manpower to stay in the business. When the price of BTC drops, selling the Bitcoin rewards may not be enough to cover the costs.

Basically, mining Bitcoin is no easy industry. And this was a common theme at the conference, including in discussions over ways for mining operations to diversify their operations.

""Bitcoin mining has a great opportunity here,"" data center guru Chad Everett Harris enthusiastically exclaimed on a panel, all while trying to convince miners to dip their toes into operating AI businesses for extra cash—a growing trend.

Paul Li, CEO of mining technology provider Fog Hashing, added that miners simply couldn't ""miss"" the opportunity to get stuck into the growing wave of AI.

But as Decrypt learned, moving from minting ""digital gold"" to running AI data centers isn't easy—even for the big dogs.

If even Nasdaq-listed miners are daunted by the prospect of getting involved in the world of AI—a costly and complex venture—then where does that leave smaller players?

A new era?

Ahead of his win, President Trump claimed that under his watch, he'd push for all future Bitcoin to be 100% American-made.

Miners largely wanted to avoid talking politics with Decrypt, and there wasn't a red hat in sight at the event—unlike the MAGA-heavy Bitcoin 2024 Nashville last summer. But there was a sense of relief among miners regarding the new administration.

""The new administration is pro-Bitcoin, pro-Bitcoin mining,"" Shanon Squires from Compass Mining told Decrypt. ""The geopolitical risk is gone—at least in my opinion.""

But as Bitcoin mining requires more resources as it becomes more mainstream, a crypto-friendly president might not be enough for the smaller players to hang around.

""It's a real business,"" added Squires. ""You have to have efficiencies at scale. You have to know what they're doing. You have to be cost-effective in your acquisition and your procurement, and run a real business.""

""It's not like, you know, a crypto ICO where you make money out of nothing,"" he concluded.

The crypto and NFT gaming space is busier than ever lately, what with prominent games starting to release, token airdrops piling up, and a seemingly constant array of other things happening at all times. It’s a lot to take in!

Luckily, Decrypt’s GG is all over it. And if you need a quick way to get caught up on the latest moves around crypto video games, we’re happy to present This Week in Crypto Games.

Our weekend roundup serves up the biggest news from the past week, along with a few other tidbits you might have missed. We also showcase a few of our original stories from the week.

Biggest news

SEC drops Immutable investigation: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has closed its investigation into Ethereum gaming platform Immutable with no enforcement action, the company announced Tuesday via a blog post.

Back in October 2024, the Commission issued Immutable a Wells Notice over alleged securities law violations relating to sales of the platform’s IMX token. The SEC had also questioned representations about the token's backing, particularly regarding a pre-launch investment from Huobi Ventures.

With this investigation now over, Immutable CEO Robbie Ferguson said that the investigation found “zero wrongdoings” and praised his team for continuing to build despite the ominous Wells Notice. The company itself also posted on X, stating that it a “huge win” for Web3 gaming and for “everyone who believes in digital ownership rights.”

The SEC has now dropped the vast majority of its cases and known investigations against crypto firms, following the inauguration of President Donald Trump.

Last year, the SEC issued Immutable a Wells Notice. That inquiry is now officially closed, with zero findings of wrongdoing, and the SEC is taking no action. This is a huge win - not just for web3 gaming, but everyone who believes in digital ownership rights. Let's build. — Immutable (@Immutable) March 25, 2025

Off the Grid mainnet: Popular shooter Off the Grid has been running on the GUNZ testnet, built as a dedicated Avalanche L1 chain. On Friday, it was confirmed that GUNZ would transition to its hotly anticipated mainnet on March 31, with the GUN token launching alongside.

This comes after Gunzilla Games Director of Web3 Theodore Agranat estimated a Q1 2025 launch back in December, adding that he wanted the game to be fully featured and polished by then. Since then, a black market for in-game skins has bloomed, showing clear signs that players are keen for the upcoming crypto integration, which will allow in-game items to be sold for crypto.

Forgotten Runiverse launches: Ronin role-playing game Forgotten Runiverse launched in early access on Wednesday, allowing users to master spells and earn rewards as they explore the open fantasy world based on the Ethereum NFT collection, Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult.

This comes after three years of development work and more than 1 million hours of testing, according to a post by Ronin Network, which became the game’s new home after it opted to migrate from Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum last year.

Now officially live after three playtest periods, the Forgotten Runiverse opens with its first major game content update, named Moonlit Wilds. With this update, players can now access land plots, build new structures, craft and mint items, as well as master up to 32 spells while embarking on quests.

GameStop goes Bitcoin: Video game store turned meme stock icon GameStop updated its investment policy on Tuesday to add ""certain cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin"" as ""permissible investment instruments."" This was then followed by a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, claiming that it is now permitted to use Bitcoin as a “Treasury Reserve Asset.”

The next day, on Wednesday, GameStop announced that it plans to raise $1.3 billion via convertible senior notes in order to fund “general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin.”

This approach takes a leaf out of Strategy’s playbook, as that firm (formerly known as MicroStrategy) has issued billions of dollars worth of convertible senior notes to purchase more Bitcoin. GameStop’s move came just weeks after CEO Ryan Cohen posted a photo on X with Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor.

Solana game Star Atlas is collaborating with SingularityNET to integrate AI agents into its online world.

There’s a first-person shooter that apparently records every single bullet on-chain via Ethereum layer-2 MegaETH—which its creator admits is just a ""silly experiment.""

Solana shooter Nyan Heroes is back with its latest playtest, including its biggest airdrop yet.

https://decrypt.co,Bull vs. Bear Markets: What They Mean for Bitcoin and Crypto,https://decrypt.co/resources/bull-vs-bear-markets-what-they-mean-bitcoin-crypto,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:32:25 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, fortunes can be made or lost overnight. A tweet or a regulatory shift can send prices soaring, while unexpected market shocks like trade wars can wipe out billions of dollars in minutes. This volatility is behind two key terms that define cryptocurrency market cycles: bull and bear markets.

Understanding these trends isn’t just about knowing when to buy or sell—it’s about survival. The differences between a bull and bear market are simple yet complex. A bull market fuels optimism, risk-taking, and price surges, while a bear market brings fear, sell-offs, and a test of investor resilience.

This article will explain what defines these market conditions, and how they impact cryptocurrency.

Did you know? The terms ""bull market"" and ""bear market"" date back to the 18th century. A bull charges with its horns upward, symbolizing rising prices, while a bear swipes downward, representing a market decline.

Defining bull and bear markets

In traditional equities markets, a bull market is generally defined as a sustained period of rising stock prices, typically lasting months or years, with gains of 20% or more. With a few key differences, bull and bear markets in crypto function much the same as traditional finance. Unlike legacy markets, however, crypto cycles are amplified by:

Extreme volatility

Continuous 24/7 trading

Lower liquidity

The absence of circuit breakers to slow rapid price swings

Cryptocurrency investors rely on technical, macroeconomic, and on-chain analysis to identify trends and effectively navigate market cycles.

“Standard technical analysis tools like moving averages, Relative Strength Index, and Bollinger Bands, can help signal cyclical shifts along with correlated markets such as the NASDAQ and Tech Stocks,” Mike Marshall, Amberdata’s head of research, told Decrypt. “Additionally, macro factors, including Fed policy, inflation, and global events, also heavily influence crypto cycles.”

On January 20, 2025, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $108,786, spurred on by the hope of a friendlier regulatory environment in the United States under newly re-elected President Donald Trump, who had promised the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

Some analysts speculated that the industry was in a bull market, with some even calling it a 'supercycle'—a prolonged period of economic expansion driven by sustained demand and investor optimism. However, that narrative was challenged when Bitcoin tumbled more than 31% to nearly $73,000 two months later.

“Everyone seemed to be saying that when the Trump administration comes in, it's going to give such a huge boost to crypto regulations,” Alice Liu, Head of Research at CoinMarketCap, told Decrypt at ETH Denver. “But so far, we haven't seen that play out in action.”

However, as Liu explained, this drop in Bitcoin’s price did not necessarily mean a bear market had taken over.

“This is a technical pullback as opposed to a structural change. The reason for that is the liquidity is still healthy,” she said.

Liquidity—how easily assets can be bought and sold without significantly impacting price—is key in distinguishing bull and bear markets. High liquidity indicates a market where transactions occur smoothly, with minimal price volatility, due to a large number of active buyers and sellers. In bear markets, liquidity tends to dry up as trading slows, amplifying price volatility.

“Even in reaction to the market shock, we saw a definite spike in trade volume, averaging around $150 million to $160 million daily,” Liu said. “And even now, as the dust has settled a little, we still see a healthy trade volume moving through the market.”

Signs of a crypto bull market

When Bitcoin and other major assets surpass previous all-time highs, it often triggers further bullish momentum. 😎 Growth in crypto sectors: Expanding activity in DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain gaming suggests broader adoption and investment in the space.

Defining the start of a Bitcoin bull market isn’t always straightforward, since different analysts use varying metrics to pinpoint its beginning. Some argue that it starts when prices recover from a major downturn, while others believe it only becomes clear once previous all-time highs are surpassed.

“Technically, one could say the bull market begins with capitulation, as prices start to rise, but most people only perceive a bull market in Bitcoin after the prior all-time high is reached until the bubble pops about a year later,” Michael Terpin, founder and CEO of Transform Ventures, told Decrypt.

Capitulation is when an investor, often driven by fear or panic, gives up on trying to recover losses and sells their assets. This typically happens after a prolonged market downturn triggered by a massive event, like the collapse of FTX in November 2022.

Signs of a crypto bear market

📉 Sustained price declines: Major cryptocurrencies experience prolonged downward trends, often dropping 20% or more from their recent highs.

Investors who hold onto their cryptocurrency despite being in a bear market, and mounting pressures to sell, are considered to have “diamond hands.”

Did you know? The term ""diamond hands"" originated in 2018 on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit.

On-chain indicators for market cycles

Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio: Compares market capitalization to realized capitalization. A high ratio suggests potential corrections, while a low ratio indicates undervaluation.

Not all financial analysts agree that a 20% swing should be considered the standard for measuring whether a market is in bull or bear territory.

“I think the typical 20% threshold that’s commonly used to define bull and bear markets in traditional finance may not be as applicable to crypto, due to the wider price moves in the latter and the 24/7 trading that makes crypto more sensitive to global events,” Coinbase Head of Institutional Research David Duong told Decrypt.

As Duong explained, crypto is often used as a proxy when traditional markets are closed, increasing the magnitude of the reaction to crypto prices.

“I’d be more inclined to use metrics like the 200-day moving average, in combination with measuring the sustainability of the given upside or downside move,” he said. “For example, how long the move lasts to define a bull or bear market.”

While crypto markets share similarities with traditional financial markets, they have unique characteristics—including extreme volatility, higher sensitivity to hype, and regulatory changes that set them apart.

“When it comes to cryptocurrency-specific technical indicators, I prefer the Market Value to Realized Value ratio or the MVRV z-score to gauge how markets are moving,” Duong said.

Investor sentiment and market trends

Investor sentiment plays an important role in shaping market cycles, with various indicators offering insights into broad trends. Measures like the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), the Put/Call Ratio, and the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Sentiment Survey help gauge investor confidence and risk appetite.

One widely followed metric, the Fear and Greed Index, aggregates market factors to assess whether investors lean toward caution or excitement. The Fear and Greed Index ranges from 0 to 100, with lower values indicating fear, suggesting cautious or bearish investor sentiment, and higher values reflecting greed, signaling optimism or bullish market behavior.

On March 30, 2025, as of this writing, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index stood at 32 (Fear), up from 17 (Extreme Fear) earlier in the month. While such indices don’t predict price movements, they often reflect broader shifts in investor thinking.

“Investors often look to sentiment as a key indicator to assess whether markets are nearing a top or bottom,” Joe Vezzani, CEO and co-founder of crypto sentiment aggregator LunarCrush, told Decrypt. “Current crypto market sentiment reached its lowest point since August 2024, when volatility spiked due to the unwinding of the yen carry trade.”

For financial analyst Jacob King, founder and CEO of WhaleWire, market sentiment also depends on whether investors believe the data.

“Indicators exist—if you trust the data, which is questionable,” King told Decrypt. “Bitcoin falling below the 200-day moving average is a major red flag. When bulls fail to hold that line, the market structure weakens, and declines accelerate.”

Market cycles and long-term investing strategies

Markets go through natural growth and decline cycles. While no strategy guarantees success, those who take a long-term, well-researched approach are better positioned to navigate financial uncertainties.

“It's important to note that what defines a bull market in crypto today isn’t just price—it’s utility, infrastructure maturity, and institutional participation,” Mike Cahill, CEO of Douro Labs, told Decrypt. “When it comes down to it, the key indicators are transaction volume acceleration, fee growth, stablecoin velocity, and capital formation on-chain. That’s when you know the next wave is real.”",decrypt
https://blockonomi.com,"Darkweb Threat Actors Claim to Possess Massive Leak of Gemini, Binance American User Data",https://blockonomi.com/darkweb-threat-actors-claim-to-possess-massive-leak-of-gemini-binance-american-user-data/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 18:05:12 GMT","Darkweb threat actors are selling over 100,000 Gemini user records and 132,744 Binance user credentials on online platforms.

According to a new blog post from Dark Web Informer, a lot of data is in play. It is a cyber threat intelligence service that monitors and reports cyber threats, including data breaches, darknet markets, DDoS attacks, and other illicit activities.

Is It Real?

The post, which went live on March 27, stated that a cybercriminal operating under the alias AKM69 listed a large database of U.S.-based cryptocurrency leads allegedly tied to Gemini, the well-known cryptocurrency exchange.

The dataset, now for sale on underground forums, is said to contain over 100,000 records with full names, emails, phone numbers, and location data. The majority of the records reportedly come from individuals based in America, with a small number of entries from Singapore and the UK.

On March 26, Dark Web Informer disclosed on X that a threat actor using the alias “kiki88888” listed a database containing Binance user data in 2025 on a hacking forum. The actor claimed to offer 132,744 records linked to Binance.com. The dataset contains emails, phone numbers, and other personal details.

Gemini has not officially confirmed any breach or direct link to the leaked data. Security experts warn that exposure of the information could lead to phishing attacks, identity theft, and cryptocurrency scams targeting affected individuals.

Binance Says It’s Phishing Attack Targeting Users

In response to reports of user information appearing on the dark web, Binance said that the information was not obtained through a direct security breach of their systems. They claimed that the data was gathered through phishing

According to the exchange, the hacker used malware to infect individual users’ computers, which then allowed the hacker to take over the users’ browser sessions and eventually stole the data.

Dark Web Informer’s statement also supports Binance’s claim. The entity suggested that the users might have clicked suspicious links or downloaded malicious software, which resulted in their information being compromised.

Big Money At Risk

Major exchanges are often high-valued targets for cybercriminals seeking to profit from sensitive personal and financial data.

In September 2024, a person identifying as “FireBear” claimed they had acquired the sensitive details of 12.8 million Binance users. These included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and even residential addresses.

FireBear said that the dataset was the result of a security lapse the previous month and then offered it for sale on the dark web.

However, Binance firmly denied these allegations after a comprehensive internal investigation. The exchange asserted that no data breach had taken place on their systems.

At the time, security experts advised users to exercise caution and be on the lookout for phishing attempts.

Cybercriminals also impersonate prominent exchanges in an attempt to deceive users. This month, the Australian Federal Police notified 130 individuals about a sophisticated scam. This scam involved messages that cleverly mimicked the sender IDs of legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, to lure recipients.

Earlier reports surfaced on X (formerly Twitter) of deceptive messages impersonating Coinbase and Gemini. These fraudulent communications aimed to trick users into setting up new cryptocurrency wallets using recovery phrases that were, in reality, controlled by the scammers themselves.

SOCRadar’s Dark Web Team reported this month that a threat actor advertised a service designed to handle and exploit stolen cryptocurrency information. The service claims to work across a vast range of over 100 different blockchain networks, including major ones like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Solana.

Microsoft also disclosed this month that it had identified a new malware targeting cryptocurrency holders called StilachiRAT. The cybersecurity threat can steal credentials stored in browsers, clipboard data, and system information.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Cardano (ADA) and Rexas Finance (RXS) are two Cryptocurrencies with the Potential to reach $5.00 soon,https://blockonomi.com/cardano-ada-and-rexas-finance-rxs-are-two-cryptocurrencies-with-the-potential-to-reach-5-00-soon/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:17:22 GMT","Though there are plenty of prospects in the crypto market, just a few initiatives have what it takes to yield significant rewards. Cardano (ADA) and Rexas Finance (RXS) are two coins with great growth potential for investors, which analysts think might hit $5.00 soon. Strong ecosystems, rising acceptance, and an optimistic investor attitude support both initiatives, making them perfect targets for significant price swings. Although Cardano is a well-known name in the crypto scene, Rexas Finance is a rising star with remarkable presale success that has already turned heads.

Cardano’s Journey to $5.00

Currently trading at roughly $0.72, Cardano has the potential to surge when the fundamentals are favorable. Changelly’s price forecast for Cardano suggests that a breakout above the resistance zone near 0.75 could see the coin race towards $1.20 before heading toward $5. The bulls are confident that Cardano will escalate due to its extensive systematic, peer-reviewed updates and efficient staking mechanisms. Cardano users might argue that the Hydra and Plutus projects could spark stronger dApp functionality, leading to higher demand for ADA. Still, they also understand that the rollout is very slow. Speculators recalling ADA’s all-time high above $3 cite the coin’s strong community support and growing interest in the token as reasons it could reach new highs.

Rexas Finance’s Rapid Ascent Toward $5.00

Although Cardano is a well-known behemoth, Rexas Finance (RXS) is fast rising and becoming among the most discussed tokens available. Though a younger project, RXS has already shown great promise with its presale, raising over $47.3 million and raising the token price from $0.03 to $0.20, a 6.67x gain for investors. Set to launch at $0.25 on June 19, 2025, RXS has attracted investors with its advanced ecosystem, emphasis on tokenisation, and ability to simplify blockchain usage. Unlike many tokens that battle to find practical applications, RXS is entering the market with a completely developed platform that lets users quickly build and release their tokens. Support of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization—an emerging sector poised to transform sectors including real estate, finance, and supply chain management—is another element driving RXS’s optimistic view. Rexas Finance is especially positioned to profit from the trillion-dollar market as big companies investigate blockchain-based tokenisation. Starting as tiny ventures before erupting into multi-billion dollar ecosystems, analysts have compared RXS’s path to that of Solana (SOL) and Binance Coin (BNB). RXS hitting $5.00 is not only a feasible but also expected among early investors given its fast expansion, solid foundations, and rising acceptance. (RXS) has a framework to stimulate early and continuous development. The maximum total supply of RXS tokens is fixed at one billion; therefore, the asset remains rare enough to profit from higher demand. Remarkably, the presale receives half of the overall supply, highlighting the project’s dedication to include the local community and luring first investors.

Moreover, Rexas Finance has set aside 2% of its inventory for a special giveaway program. Twenty fortunate investors under this program stand to earn RXS tokens valued at $50,000. This deliberate distribution encourages early involvement, promotes community ownership, and hence increases demand for the token as it is ready for public release. Strong fundamental cryptocurrencies usually do better in bull markets, and both ADA and RXS have the components required for a significant price rise historically. $5.00 for these two currencies is a reasonable goal rather than merely conjecture as more liquidity comes into crypto and institutional investors keep acquiring outstanding assets. Furthermore, RXS attracts the interest of whale investors from other top coins, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Particularly once the token is listed on significant exchanges, this capital influx generally results in aggressive price increases.

Final Thoughts

Two initiatives in various development phases, Cardano and Rexas Finance, have one important quality: they are ready for notable expansion in 2025 and beyond. While Rexas Finance is the new disruptor upending the market with its creative tokenising ideas, Cardano is a seasoned player in the crypto world constantly striving for more acceptance and scalability. Both tokens might reach $5.00 in the following months, giving investors significant returns as ADA recovers its optimistic momentum and RXS is ready to explode upon debut. These two assets are worth watching for those wishing to profit from the next wave of crypto millionaires.

This AI Altcoin Raised $12M And Now Eyes 9,700% Gains",https://blockonomi.com/missed-solana-at-1-this-ai-altcoin-raised-12m-and-now-eyes-9700-gains/,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 10:21:43 GMT","Investors in crypto consistently pursue blockbuster altcoins that achieve 50x to 100x value increases throughout a single trading cycle. The crypto breakout of 2021 belonged to SOL, with the Solana price rallying from $1 in 2019 to nearly $300 by 2025.

The new phase of the bull market brings forward new technologies that focus on artificial intelligence for mainstream adoption. IntelMarkets (INTL) introduces itself as one of the most innovative AI projects. Developed by a team of MIT, Renaissance Technologies, and OpenAI, the IntelMarkets software has been praised as a leader in the industry.

IntelMarkets (INTL): Combining AI and DeFi for Explosive Potential

IntelMarkets (INTL) develops an AI-based trading platform which aims to construct a revolutionary system for crypto trading. Its upcoming platform integrates self-learning AI algorithms that create automated advanced trading functions alongside real-time large data analysis to provide tips when trading.

The platform is based on dual chains of Ethereum and Solana, operating at high speeds while providing exceptional flexibility that sets itself apart from other AI platforms. The main distinguishing factor of INTL emerges from its stage of development.

INTL tokens are selling in presale at $0.09, as over 150,000 wallets have signed up before its listing on Tier-1 crypto exchanges. Market analysts predict that IntelMarkets could potentially surge by up to 9,700% after its launch, especially after raising more than $12 million in presale.

Solana (SOL): From $1 Underdog to Top-10 Powerhouse

SOL has achieved a remarkable meteoric rise in the crypto space that remains one of the most famous in its recent history. During 2020 Solana’s price was below $1, before experiencing a 290x growth. Reaching its ATH in Jan 2025, the Solana price surpassed the $294 mark.

However, since then, SOL has dropped off. At $140, the Solana price experienced a 52% fall in the last 3 months. The bearish performance of SOL cannot eclipse the fact that its market capitalization prevents substantial exponential growth in the future. Analysts predict the Solana price will recover back to $200 in Q2.

Why Investors Are Looking Beyond Solana

The demand for AI-powered cryptocurrency solutions continues to escalate in 2025. INTL has launched its presale at an opportune moment to capture this market. As many traders look for the next big gainer, many realize that Solana’s price isn’t capable of giving the same 300x gains as it once did.

The people who did not invest in SOL during its initial period have a chance to invest in the new AI wave. The market transition has encouraged numerous investors to select lower-value initiatives that have compelling stories and new growth opportunities which align with IntelMarkets’ strengths.

The SOL network currently exists in an environment of network congestion. Decreased meme coin activity together with rising Layer-1 chain competition makes it challenging for the Solana price to sustain its legendary gains. IntelMarkets stands at the frontier to drive industry forward, potentially becoming the next big altcoin.

The Next SOL-Like Opportunity Is Here

The crypto world witnessed its most substantial wealth-generation event through SOL, but the time for maximum profit has expired. Many analysts establish IntelMarkets (INTL) as the upcoming high-potential initiative that will reshape market dynamics.

The project demonstrates all necessary components for massive success through its real-world application alongside its disruptive AI-DeFi protocol during its recently successful presale which collected more than $12 million.

Early adopters who spotted ETH’s potential before the mainstream caught on saw life-changing returns. Fast forward to today, and a new performer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is displaying eerily similar early-stage indicators, strong developer backing, innovative DeFi utilities, and a low market cap primed for exponential growth. The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale has sold over 93% and continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.02 and has collected $5.4 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.025 while attracting more than 7200 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 200% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06 while future forecast estimates predict a value surge past $1 in the near future.

A DeFi Giant on the Rise

Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 7200 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $5.4 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.02 in Phase 3 even though investors anticipate a 25% price increase in Phase 4 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $1 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource.

The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending

Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi.

A Reliable and Secure Financial Network

Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects.

To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $1 million to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform.

Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion

Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token.

Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as the next big crypto opportunity, with its presale nearly sold out and a 200% ROI potential upon launch. Early investors stand to gain significantly as Phase 4 brings a 25% price jump, pushing MUTM to $0.025 before its projected surge past $1. With over 7200 investors onboard and $5.4 million raised, this is the final call to secure your position before the mainstream catches on. Don’t miss out and act now and be part of the next potential DeFi giant.
