However, new reports of the allergy, called alpha-gal syndrome, show that the much more widespread black-legged ticks (Ixodes) can also transmit the disease.

Whereas lone star ticks are found mainly in the southern and eastern U.S., black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis), also called deer ticks, are present in the eastern half of the U.S. and the Midwest and the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) inhabits the West Coast, according to Mayo Clinic .

The new case reports suggest that people in a wide swath of the U.S. are at risk of tick-borne alpha-gal syndrome. However, ""evidence continues to support that in the U.S., most alpha-gal syndrome patients develop the allergy after experiencing a bite from a lone star tick,"" Dr. Johanna Salzer , a veterinary medical officer and epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Division of Vector-Borne Diseases and a co-author of both case reports, told Live Science in an email.

Given that a variety of tick species have been linked to alpha-gal syndrome outside the U.S., scientists had long suspected that black-legged ticks in the U.S. also transmit the allergy.

""For us, it was never just the lone star tick,"" Jennifer Platt , co-founder of the nonprofit Tick-Borne Conditions United and an adjunct faculty member at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, wrote in a blog post . ""With thousands of Lyme [a tick-borne disease] patients telling us they can't tolerate red meat, we've long suspected black-legged ticks and other tick species in the US,"" she noted.

""Although our publications are some of the first reports linking blacklegged ticks in the US to alpha-gal syndrome, bites from these species in the U.S. leading to alpha-gal syndrome almost certainly have occurred prior to these reports,"" Salzer said.

In alpha-gal syndrome, the immune system overreacts to a sugar known as galactose-α-1,3-galactose, or ""alpha-gal"" for short. Those affected can develop severe allergic reactions not only to red meat but also to some medications, personal care products, and medical treatments containing ingredients from mammalian tissues, where this sugar is found.

The first case , reported in the April 4 issue of the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, described a Maine woman who developed alpha-gal syndrome after a confirmed black-legged tick (I. scapularis) bite.

The 45-year-old woman first experienced inflammation and itchiness at the bite site, followed by abdominal pain and malaise nine days later, after eating rabbit. Over the next two weeks, she continued having digestive problems after consuming red meat. A severe episode of diarrhea and vomiting hours after she ate beef prompted her to visit a health care provider 20 days after the tick bite. Blood tests revealed extremely high levels of alpha-gal-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), confirming alpha-gal syndrome. Her allergy resolved after 10 months.

The second case of alpha-gal syndrome, reported in the same journal issue, involved a 61-year-old wildlife biologist in Washington. After a confirmed bite from the western black-legged tick (I. pacificus), she experienced a skin rash and lip swelling, followed by a severe allergic reaction 29 days later, after she ate red meat, and required emergency epinephrine (EpiPen) treatment. After being diagnosed with alpha-gal syndrome, she avoided meat and had no further reactions. Some years later, she got two more I. pacificus tick bites, which triggered a rise in alpha-gal IgE antibodies.

To date, why tick bites can trigger alpha-gal syndrome is poorly understood. ""We are only beginning to delve into the science of this and other tick-borne diseases — there's so much we don't know,"" Platt said.

Research has shown that some tick species produce alpha-gal antigens — proteins that trigger an immune response — and secrete these antigens in their saliva during feeding. This may trigger the alpha-gal allergy in humans. ""The ticks do NOT pick up [alpha-gal antigens] from animals and then transmit them to humans,"" Platt emphasized.

""More studies are needed to discover details about how a tick bite triggers alpha-gal syndrome in some people, and why bites from lone star ticks appear to cause the majority of the human cases in the United States versus blacklegged, western blacklegged, and other ticks,"" Salzer said.",livescience
https://livescience.com,James Webb telescope could find signs of life on alien 'hycean' ocean worlds,https://www.livescience.com/space/exoplanets/james-webb-telescope-could-find-signs-of-life-on-alien-hycean-ocean-worlds,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 18:00:00 GMT","Hycean worlds, which are a possible kind of exoplanet with deep oceans surrounded by a thick envelope of hydrogen, could provide the best chance for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to detect biosignatures, according to a new study.

Those potential signs of life are a group of chemicals called methyl halides, which on Earth are produced by some bacteria and ocean algae.

""Unlike an Earth-like planet, where atmospheric noise and telescope limitations make it difficult to detect biosignatures, hycean planets offer a much clearer signal,"" said Eddie Schwieterman, who is an astrobiologist at the University of California, Riverside, in a statement .

For now, the existence of hycean planets remains hypothetical. Their name is a portmanteau of ""hydrogen"" and ""ocean,"" first coined in 2021 by planetary scientist Nikku Madhusudhan of the University of Cambridge.

Related: 'Hycean' exoplanets may not be able to support life after all

Hycean planets are expected to orbit red dwarf stars, and the best candidate for a hycean world is the planet K2-18b. This exoplanet, which is categorized as a ""sub-Neptune"" world, orbits in the habitable zone of a red dwarf star 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Leo, the Lion.

The Hubble Space Telescope discovered water vapor in K2-18b's atmosphere in 2019, and JWST has detected the presence of carbon dioxide and methane in the planet's atmosphere, along with a lack of carbon monoxide and ammonia — exactly as predicted by the hycean planet hypothesis. There's also tentative evidence that a compound called dimethyl sulfide, which on Earth is only produced by ocean plankton, also exists in K2-18b's atmosphere, but this evidence continues to prove contentious .

Now a team of researchers at the University of California, Riverside and ETH Zurich in Switzerland have gone a step further. They propose that another family of compounds called methyl halides, generated by microbial ocean life on Earth, could produce a biosignature — that is, a chemical signature of biological life — in the atmosphere of a hycean world that's more easily detectable than the signature of oxygen is on an Earth-like planet.

""Oxygen is currently difficult or impossible to detect on an Earth-like planet,"" said Michaela Leung of the University of California, Riverside, the first author of a new paper describing the research. ""However, methyl halides on hycean worlds offer a unique opportunity for detection with existing technology.""

Methyl halides are molecules that incorporate carbon atoms and three hydrogen atoms attached to a halogen atom such as bromine, chlorine or fluorine. (Halogens are group of reactive, non-metallic elements.) On Earth, methyl halides are produced by life, but they are far from abundant in our planet's atmosphere.

On hycean worlds, however, things could be different. Leung's team suspect that the conditions on such worlds, should they exist, would allow methyl halides to accumulate in large quantities in the atmosphere. Furthermore, methyl halides would have strong absorption features in infrared light, at the same wavelengths that the JWST is designed to observe.

""One of the great benefits of looking for methyl halides is, you could potentially find them in as few as 13 hours with James Webb. That is similar or lower, by a lot, to how much telescope time you'd need to find gases like oxygen or methane,"" said Leung. ""Less time with the telescope means it's less expensive.""

Related: The search for alien life

There are two caveats to what Leung's team propose. One is that we don't yet know whether hycean worlds actually exist. They were proposed as a possibility to explain certain properties of some warm sub-Neptune-type planets that have average densities that imply a thick hydrogen atmosphere and a deep ocean of liquid water. However, directly observing an ocean beneath such a world's hydrogen envelope is not currently feasible.

The second issue is that we don't know if such oceans could be habitable. A hycean world would be hot, and although the extreme conditions beneath the hydrogen envelope would prevent the ocean from evaporating, it is uncertain whether it would be too hot for life as we know it. However, a positive detection of methyl halides in the atmosphere of a candidate hycean world would be a strong indication that life could exist there in a deep ocean.

If life does exist on such a world, it would have to breathe hydrogen, not oxygen.

""These microbes, if we found them, would be anaerobic,"" said Schwieterman. ""They'd be adapted to a very different type of environment, and we can't really conceive of what that looks like, except to say that these gases are a plausible output from their metabolism.""

Anaerobic life — i.e., lifeforms making do without oxygen — exist on Earth, so it wouldn't be truly alien to life on our planet, even if the environment that it would live in is. Earth-like worlds orbiting red dwarfs could be in short supply, since red dwarfs are fierce little beasts, prone to unleashing bursts of harsh radiation that can strip away the atmosphere of an Earth-like planet. However, hycean worlds protected by their thick hydrogen atmospheres might be less vulnerable to attack from their star.

It could therefore be that hycean worlds are where life resides in red dwarf systems, and since red dwarfs make up about three-quarters of all stars in our Milky Way galaxy, there could be many more habitable hycean worlds in the cosmos than Earth-like worlds.",livescience
https://livescience.com,"Black holes may obey the laws of physics after all, new theory suggests",https://www.livescience.com/space/black-holes/black-holes-may-obey-the-laws-of-physics-after-all-new-theory-suggests,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:00:00 GMT","A team of scientists has developed a recipe for black holes that eliminates one of the most troubling aspects of physics: the central singularity, the point at which all our theories, laws and models shatter.

If you were going to design an object to preserve mystery while being utterly troubling, you couldn't do much better than a black hole .

First, the outer boundary of these cosmic titans is a one-way light-trapping surface called an event horizon , the point at which a black hole's gravity is so powerful that not even light can escape. This means no information can escape from within a black hole, so we can never directly observe or measure what lies at its heart.

Using the mathematics of Einstein's 1915 theory of gravity, called general relativity , scientists can model the interior of a black hole. The problem is that, when they do this, general relativity tells us that all mathematical values go to infinity at the ""singularity"" at the heart of a black hole.

This new research suggests that ""ordinary black holes"" without a central singularity — the physics equivalent of having your cake and eating it — may be more than just the fever dream of hopeful physicists.

""The singularity is the most mysterious and problematic part of a black hole. It's where our concepts of space and time literally no longer make sense,"" study team member Robie Hennigar, a researcher at Durham University in England, told Space.com. ""If black holes do not have singularities, then they are much more ordinary.""

Singularity-minded: Physicists want one thing

Einstein's theory of general relativity states that objects with mass curve the very fabric of space-time (the three dimensions of space united with the one dimension of time), and gravity arises from this curvature. The greater the mass, the more extreme the curvature of space-time, and the stronger the influence of gravity. All of this is calculated with the equations that underpin general relativity: Einstein's field equations.

""The way that the space-time curves is determined by the Einstein field equations, which are the cornerstone of general relativity,"" team member Pablo Antonio Cano Molina-Niñirola, of the Institute of Cosmos Sciences of the University of Barcelona (ICCUB) in Spain, told Space.com.

""These equations are extremely successful, as they predict a plethora of observable phenomena in the cosmos, from the motion of planets to the evolution of the universe and the existence of black holes,"" he added. ""But they also predict the existence of singularities, and this is problematic.""



Black holes — regions of space-time with extreme curvature — first arose as a concept from solutions to Einstein's field equations suggested by German physicist and astronomer Karl Schwartzchild as he served on the front line during the First World War in 1915. These solutions go to infinity at the center of that region. Physicists don't like infinities, as they indicate the breakdown or incompleteness of their models, or suggest something entirely unphysical. That means something really troubling and undesirable for physicists.

""In general relativity, the interior of a black hole is like a contracting universe, where the singularity represents the moment when space itself collapses,"" Molina-Niñirola said.

Molina-Niñirola added that many physicists believe that, when gravity becomes exceptionally strong and space-time is highly warped, general relativity must be replaced by a more fundamental theory. It has been presumed that this would be a theory of quantum gravity leading to a ""theory of everything"" that would unite the so-far incompatible theories of general relativity and quantum physics .

""The hope is that, in this complete theory, black hole singularities will be removed,"" Molina-Niñirola said. ""Now, our recipe for regular black holes goes precisely in this direction, but instead of using a complete theory of quantum gravity, we use something called an 'effective theory.' This is a classical theory of gravity that is supposed to capture the effects of an assumed theory of quantum gravity.""

This amounts to the team modifying the Einstein field equations so that gravity behaves differently when space-time is highly curved. Ultimately, this leads to the removal of black holes' central singularities.

Quantum gravity and other problems

This newly modified theory suggests there is no singularity at the heart of a black hole. So what does exist in this extreme, exotic realm?

""In our model, the space-time collapse stops, and the singularity is replaced by a highly warped static region that lies at the core of the black hole,"" Molina-Niñirola said. ""This region is static because it does not contract. That means an observer could hypothetically stay there, assuming they were able to survive the huge, but finite, gravitational forces in this region.""

Apart from curved space-time, what else dwells at the heart of black holes, if this theory is correct? According to Hennigar, strictly speaking, nothing.

""These black holes are pure vacuum everywhere; there need not be matter present, but one can easily include it if desired,"" the University of Durham researcher continued. ""It might sound weird to have a black hole in the absence of matter, but the same thing can happen even in general relativity.""

Even if the team's black hole concept were verified, it likely wouldn't halt the search for a valid model of quantum gravity and a theory of everything.

""In some sense, this is a problem that cannot be avoided. Stars are collapsing all the time in our universe; it is an unavoidable physical process. But this commonplace occurrence is something that pushes us past everything we know,"" Hennigar continued. ""In the final stages of collapse, just before one would reach the singularity, both gravity and quantum effects will be important.

""So we already know that the conclusions one would draw from general relativity alone are insufficient to describe such an extreme place/moment.""

Does losing the singularity mean losing the mystery? Not quite...

If correct, this research may have somewhat demystified black holes, but it opens up many questions that will still have to be answered.

""Our work provides answers to some mysteries, but it opens others,"" Molina-Niñirola said. ""For instance, according to our model — and other proposals in scientific literature — the matter that falls inside a regular black hole would ultimately exit the black hole through a white hole located in a different universe or in a disconnected region of the same universe.

""This looks very exotic, but it is the only possibility if singularities do not exist: all that goes into a black hole must eventually come out of it.""

The researcher added that this process entails problems of its own, which must also be investigated to assess the robustness of the team's idea.

The big question is whether scientists could ever find evidence for this theory from actual observations of black holes; after all, we know we can't simply peer into their interiors.

""It’s difficult to say, since the effects that lead to singularity resolution might only become observable in regimes of extremely strong gravity, probably far stronger than what we can hope to observe,"" Molina-Niñirola said. ""However, there are some experiments that can offer us some possibilities.""

Molina-Niñirola explained that the observation of ripples in space-time called gravitational waves allows astronomers to observe much stronger gravitational fields than ever before. This gives scientists a unique chance at trying to spot effects beyond general relativity, including those that may lead to singularity resolution.

Additionally, if the team's theory is correct, there should be a tell-tale imprint in the very early universe, during the era of cosmic inflation right after the Big Bang .

""In this regard, the detection of a primordial, gravitational wave background — which has not been detected yet — could provide hints on possible modifications of gravity,"" Molina-Niñirola said. ""Finally, a consequence of the absence of singularities is that the end-product of black hole evaporation via Hawking radiation would be a microscopic black hole.



""These microscopic black holes provide a possible dark matter candidate. Thus, if dark matter turned out to be composed of tiny black holes, this would be an indirect proof in favor of the absence of singularities.""

The team's research was published in the journal Physics Letters B in February 2025.

In the promotional video , the robot, called Figure 02 and manufactured by the company Figure, marches with a ""human-like"" gait. This is an ability it claims will help its robot to navigate the physical world more easily.

""These initial results are exciting, but we believe they only hint at the full potential of our technology,"" company representatives wrote in a blog post accompanying its announcement. ""We're committed to extending our learned policy to handle every human-like scenario the robot might face in the real world.""

Robots have been running , cartwheeling , doing backflips , breakdancing , and beating us at chess for years now. But performing tasks that appear simple to humans, such as walking in a straight line, gripping objects , tying shoelaces , and navigating social situations, have proven tough for robots to master.

The problem, known as Moravec's Paradox , emerges because computers excel at problems that require complex calculations and large datasets, but lack our real-world experience honed by millions of years of evolution. This makes robots' shuffling gaits, well, robotic at best. At worst, it gives them the appearance that they may have soiled themselves.

To tackle the robot's unnatural gait, Figure's engineers used a learning technique called reinforcement learning — placing thousands of virtual robots inside a physics simulator that recreates various terrains, thereby improving their walking through trial and error.

By rewarding the virtual robot army for natural motions, they refined their gaits to appear more human-like. With this task accomplished, they uploaded the refined ""Learned Natural Walking"" model to a real-world Figure 02 robot. The result is an android that can move somewhat naturally, with heel strikes, toe-offs and synchronized arm swings.

Figure's reinforcement learning technique is key to the California company's plans to roll out its robots on factory floors. It has already tested its humanoid robots in a BMW factory in 2024 and plans to introduce more this year. Meanwhile, Apptronik, a Texas-based competitor, is also commercializing its humanoid robot, Apollo, for use in Mercedes-Benz factories by the end of 2025.

The image shows the center of NGC 346, an open star cluster where new stars are born. Previous studies found about 2,500 infant stars in NGC 346 that have formed from gravitationally collapsing gas clouds. However, they have yet to become full-fledged stars.

As a star factory, the SMC fascinates astronomers because it lacks the heavier elements found in large galaxies like the Milky Way. These heavy elements are the byproducts of multiple generations of stars — something the SMC has lacked due to its small size. Dwarf galaxies like the SMC are thought of as primitive building blocks of larger galaxies. In that way, the SMC is a unique and very close example of what was happening in the early universe.",livescience

https://theconversation.com,Uncertainty and pessimism abound. Will fear be enough to push Dutton into office?,https://theconversation.com/uncertainty-and-pessimism-abound-will-fear-be-enough-to-push-dutton-into-office-247360,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 19:04:46 GMT","Tony Abbott was once unelectable. So were Donald Trump and Boris Johnson.

And so was Peter Dutton, not so long ago. But opinion polls over much of 2024 and early 2025 indicated otherwise, and a nightly assault of pre-election political advertising – as my wife and I watched reruns of Law & Order: Criminal Intent – suggested that the Liberals had done their research and needed to humanise their man.

Devotees of Detectives Goren and Eames in that venerable program were able to enjoy briefly reviewing Detective Senior Constable Dutton’s time as a Queensland cop, as well as his splendid business career (which has received some closer scrutiny since) and his more recent meeting and greeting of ordinary Australians as a likeable everyman and all-round good guy.

The ad sometimes played twice in a particular break: the saturation coverage suggested that the Liberals had done rather well with donors. Unfortunately for Dutton, we later gained a deeper insight into the very high priority he attaches to rattling the can for the Liberal Party. Dutton’s decision to attend a fundraiser in Sydney while a cyclone was descending on Queensland did him immense damage, recalling his predecessor’s “I don’t hold a hose, mate” response to the Black Summer bushfires of 2020-21.

If historical precedent is any guide, Dutton’s task should be somewhere between formidable and impossible. When Australians elect their national governments, they can normally assume they are doing so for at least two terms. The last one-termer was the Labor government of James Scullin, elected in October 1929 and sent into oblivion via an election held a few days before Christmas in 1931.

Scullin was a victim of the century’s greatest international economic crisis; governments everywhere faltered or disintegrated under similar pressures. The economic challenges faced by the present Labor government have been more modest. But will it suffer a similar fate to Scullin’s Depression-era administration?

Normally, the rarity of one-termers might have provided Anthony Albanese with a measure of reassurance. But we live in an era where historical precedent seems to count for little.

That was clear enough even at the 2022 election. It was unprecedented in several respects. There was nothing resembling the atmosphere of excitement of 1972, 1983 and 2007 – or, for that matter, 1929 – which had brought Labor governments to power from opposition and awarded them solid or large majorities.

Labor’s majority on the floor of the House of Representatives following the 2022 election was piddling – a mere three seats, and just two after the election of a speaker. Its primary vote was about 32%. It won just five of the 30 available seats in the third most populous Australian state, Queensland.

There had never been a Labor victory like this one. Its exceptionalism haunts Labor’s efforts to gain re-election in 2025.

Labor won in 2022 rather like many state Labor oppositions have won in recent decades. The margin was narrow. The unpopularity of a government, and its leader, was there to be exploited. Again and again, state Labor oppositions have fallen over the line at an initial election, sometimes able only to form minority government: Bob Carr, Mike Rann, Peter Beattie, Steve Bracks and Annastacia Palaszczuk were all examples.

Voters seemed at best grudging in their support, but enough were willing to give Labor a go and then look over the results when a new election came round a few years later. In each case, governments were able to consolidate, sometimes winning landslide victories by establishing their credentials, exploiting incumbency, and building new constituencies.

There were signs Albanese might do the same after May 2022. His slim three-seat majority became a five-seat advantage when Labor’s Mary Doyle won the Aston byelection on April 1 2023 – a seat deep in the traditional Liberal heartland. As late as the Dunkley byelection of March 2 2024, also in Melbourne, the base of electoral support that had seen Albanese into office almost two years before looked to be more or less intact.

Part of the problem for the Coalition seemed to lie with Dutton himself. Would Australians vote for him? Or to put it more precisely: would the kinds of voters in the mainland capital cities who had turned so sharply against Scott Morrison in 2022 shift their votes to a figure as conservative and as bleak as Dutton?

That bleakness always struck me as being a bigger problem than the conservatism. Australians routinely elect conservative prime ministers. They elected Malcolm Fraser when they thought he was a conservative (as indeed he was). Then they elected him twice more. They elected John Howard, who had proudly called himself the Liberal Party’s most conservative leader ever. Then they elected him another three times. They elected Abbott, even if buyer’s remorse quickly followed. They elected Morrison when the Coalition had seemed dead in the water.

But leaders such as Howard and Morrison were much more optimistic than Dutton. They both seemed to think Australia was a pretty good place full of pretty good people and that all things being equal, the future was likely to be pretty good too while there were pretty good blokes in charge (but, of course, it would be much better under a Coalition government, which had the best blokes).

Abbott, to be sure, was more pessimistic – his description of the Syrian conflict as a struggle between “baddies” and “baddies”, and his references to “death cults”, said more about his habit of reducing complexity to melodrama than it did about that Middle East. Yet Abbott’s outlook, at least as expressed publicly while in office, was nowhere near as dismal as Dutton’s.

For Dutton, the enemy is close to home, menacing us in the dark. His bleakness is in a league of its own.

Lech Blaine’s portrait in his Quarterly Essay Bad Cop was convincing: Dutton was a man formed and perhaps damaged by his experience as a policeman, and a political hardman in the habit of painting whole groups of people – commonly politically vulnerable – as a threat to society. Dutton evokes a vision of good people besieged by bad, of the decent and law-abiding as in constant danger of being swamped by the immoral and the criminal – or possibly mugged on their way home from a Melbourne restaurant.

As 2024 unfolded, no one doubted there was sufficient dissatisfaction with Labor building, especially in many outer Australian suburbs, to do the government serious damage at an election. Persistently high interest rates had increased the cost of a mortgage. Inflation had moderated, but living standards had taken a beating. The chattering classes started talking of the inevitability of minority government, but they usually meant minority Labor government. Then they started talking about minority Coalition government, as the polls turned nastier for Labor.

Labor spirits have revived in recent weeks after Dutton’s missteps over Cyclone Alfred, a comfortable victory in the Western Australian election, and opinion polling that shows the ALP ahead on a two-party preferred count. Still, uncertainty abounds.

Albanese often campaigned poorly last time: will he again falter? Dutton, meanwhile, is untested as leader in an election campaign, has little policy on the table, and has a habit of going missing when there are hard questions to be answered.

For me, the key to this election is whether there is a sufficient number of voters, concentrated in the right places, who share enough of Dutton’s pessimism about their own circumstances and, to a lesser extent, about the general state of the country. If, indeed, there is enough congruence between Dutton’s bleakness and theirs, Australia may well have a new government and a new prime minister by winter.

But Dutton’s blessed run might well have now come to an end. Inflation has moderated, the Reserve Bank has made a cut to interest rates, and a sense of scepticism seems to have settled in about Dutton among voters taking a serious look at him as a potential prime minister a few weeks ago.

He now looks more like Old Mother Hubbard with a bare policy cupboard, desperately seeking to shore up the hard right vote against depredations from Pauline Hanson and Clive Palmer, than Australia’s answer to Donald Trump.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,What are caretaker conventions and how do they limit governments during election periods?,https://theconversation.com/what-are-caretaker-conventions-and-how-do-they-limit-governments-during-election-periods-251366,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 19:05:19 GMT","Now that the election has been called for May 3, parliament has been dissolved and the caretaker government period has commenced. During this period, the caretaker conventions require the government to exercise self-restraint. It must stick to routine government business and not embark on major new commitments.

There are commonly claims in the media that various actions by the government breach the caretaker conventions. Before the accusations start flying, here are the basics to help you make your own assessment.

Why do we have caretaker conventions?

There are two reasons for caretaker conventions. First, once parliament is dissolved, the government can no longer be called to account by parliament. It should therefore be more restrained in its actions while not under parliamentary scrutiny.

Second, as a matter of fairness, the government should not be entering into binding commitments immediately before an election, if they will burden an incoming government. It is unfair for an outgoing government to stack important statutory positions with its own people or enter into contracts that commit a new government to policies it opposes.

When do the caretaker conventions apply?

The caretaker conventions commence from the moment parliament is dissolved. They continue until the election result shows the existing government has been returned to office or a new government is formed.

If there is a hung parliament, it may take a few weeks before we know who will form the new government. If important matters have to be resolved during that prolonged caretaker period, the opposition may be consulted to try to get a cooperative outcome. The existing government, however, retains full legal power to act at all times.

How do the caretaker conventions restrict government actions?

Before each federal election, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet issues a document called Guidance on Caretaker Conventions. It sets out the rules for ministers and public servants.

During the caretaker period, a government must avoid:

making major policy decisions that are likely to commit an incoming government

making significant appointments

entering into major contracts or undertakings, such as entry into treaties or other international agreements.

Whether a decision, appointment or policy is major, is a matter of judgement. In making this assessment, consideration is given to whether it is likely to be controversial or a matter of contention between the government and the opposition. The cost of the decision and its impact on future resources and policies will also be considered.

Both the government and the opposition can still, of course, make election commitments about future action. The caretaker conventions only apply to actions taken within the caretaker period. They also do not apply to decisions made and actions taken before the caretaker period commenced, even if they are only announced after it has commenced.

The public service and the caretaker period

Rules have also developed on the fair use of the public service and public resources before and after elections. Technically, these are not part of the caretaker conventions, which concern self-restraint by ministers. But because they concern fairness in relation to elections, they are often lumped in with the caretaker conventions and they are included within the official guidance document.

These rules are based upon obligations imposed on public servants by statutes and other instruments, such as the Public Service Act 1999 (Cth), and APS Code of Conduct. They require public servants to behave in an impartial and apolitical manner. They also require that public resources not be used to advantage political parties during an election campaign.

It is also customary to restrict the use of government advertising during the caretaker period to necessary matters, and those that do not highlight the role of ministers or promote the achievements or policies of the government.

Two recent examples show how these rules can become controversial during an election campaign. In 2013, the Rudd Labor government was criticised by the opposition for breaching the caretaker conventions by running ads, within Australia, about asylum-seekers not being settled in Australia. The ads were reluctantly approved by public servants under a ministerial direction that they were obliged to obey.

The opposition was happy for the ads to be run in overseas countries, as a source of information and deterrence, but regarded their publication in Australia as partisan and breaching the rules. Opposition spokesperson Scott Morrison called it a “shameless and desperate” grab for votes, with the government spending taxpayers’ money to advertise to the vote-people, rather than the boat people.

On the day of the 2022 election, the Morrison Coalition government instructed the Department of Home Affairs to publish a statement that a boat containing asylum seekers had been intercepted.

It requested that this information be emailed immediately to journalists and tweeted by the Australian Border Force. The issue was highly political. Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a press conference before any announcement had been made that:

I’ve been here to stop this boat. But in order for me to be here to stop those that may come from here, you need to vote Liberals and Nationals today.

Officials published a factual statement about the boat, because they were required to act as directed by the minister. But, as a subsequent investigation revealed, they refused requests to amplify the controversy by sending material to journalists and to publish it on social media, as this would breach their obligations to be apolitical.

Who enforces the caretaker conventions?

The caretaker conventions are not legally binding and cannot be enforced by a court. But some governors-general have given effect to the conventions by deferring action on anything that would breach them. Then, when the election is over, a new government can decide whether to proceed with the matter.

Breaches by public servants of their obligations under codes of conduct and the Public Service Act can have real consequences, such as disciplinary action being taken against them.

While conventions are not legally enforceable, they ordinarily work because there is agreement among political actors that these rules are fair and politically binding on them. Controversy in the media about breaches of conventions can raise public anger. Punishment is left in the hands of the voters.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,View from The Hill: Dutton has questions to answer on gas; Albanese has supermarket answer still hunting for the problem,https://theconversation.com/view-from-the-hill-dutton-has-questions-to-answer-on-gas-albanese-has-supermarket-answer-still-hunting-for-the-problem-253118,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:22:54 GMT","Peter Dutton is a tease when it comes to the fine print of policies. At least that’s the benign explanation. Critics have a harsher take on why we’re always being told to wait for the detail. They would claim his policies are often thin, or unfolded on the run.

Right now, we’re into the first week of the campaign, with polls published on Sunday turning in Labor’s direction, and we’re still waiting for more on the Coalition’s gas reservation policy, announced in Dutton’s budget reply, as well as precision on its immigration policy and for how much extra it would spend on defence.

Dutton said on Sunday we’d get information on the gas policy in the next “couple of days”.

Danny Price, of Frontier Economics, has been hard at work, putting some modelling together. Price did the modelling for the opposition’s controversial nuclear policy, finding it much cheaper than the government’s energy transition plan. But those numbers depend on the assumptions. That modelling was contested, and no doubt so will be the gas policy analysis.

Whatever the numbers that come out, they won’t include one key figure: what you would (arguably) save on your power bill. The opposition has learned something from Labor’s debacle of promising, before the last election, that its energy policy would save households $275 by 2025.

At the weekend Albanese dismissed Labor’s modelling before the 2022 election as “RepuTex modelling based on the circumstances at the time”. Indeed.

Dutton has, however, suggested his gas policy would reduce the wholesale domestic price from $14 per gigajoule to under $10 a gigajoule. More gas would mean cheaper prices, is its logic.

The opposition’s thinking is that it lands the generality of a policy first, lets the public absorb that, and then produces detail. But the trouble with releasing the detail so late is the Coalition is likely to get bogged down in a confusing and damaging debate over what opponents will say are dodgy numbers and assumptions.

This can lose a day or more and there aren’t that many days in a five-week campaign, especially when pre-polling starts a fortnight before the end.

While Dutton was batting off questions about gas at the weekend, Anthony Albanese swung into his campaign stride in a comfort zone – at attack on supermarkets.

He announced that if re-elected, Labor will legislate against supermarkets being able to price gouge. Not immediately though. There’d be a taskforce to work out the detail.

There’s more than a touch of chutzpah here. We’ve just seen the report of a long inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission into supermarkets. It found they were very profitable but it didn’t find price gouging. Its raft of recommendations did not include legislation on price gouging.

This hasn’t deterred the PM, who provided his own definition of the problem. “I got asked today by someone … ‘how do you know what price gouging is?’ Price gouging is when supermarkets are taking the piss off Australian consumers. That’s what it is. That’s what price gouging is. Everyone out there knows. Consumers know. We’ll take action here.”

He did give the rather less colloquial EU definition.“In the EU, a price is unfair and excessive if, and to quote their law, ‘it has no reasonable relation to the economic value of the product supplied’.”

After a fairly ordinary start to the campaign, this week Donald Trump will step right into the centre of it, with his much-anticipated tariff announcement. Australian officials continue to lobby the US; no one is confidently predicting whether or not we’ll be escape the firing line.

Before the Trump announcement will come Tuesday’s first meeting of the new monetary policy board that has been set up under Labor’s changes to the Reserve Bank.

Unlike February, when all the heat was on the bank’s governor to deliver that rate cut (which did come), nobody is expecting another cut yet. Michele Bullock can relax this week.",theconversation

A national Newspoll, conducted March 27–29 from a sample of 1,249, gave Labor a 51–49 lead, a two-point gain for Labor since the previous Newspoll, three weeks ago. This is Labor’s first Newspoll lead since July 2024.

Primary votes were 37% Coalition (down two), 33% Labor (up one), 12% Greens (steady), 6% One Nation (down one) and 12% for all Others (up two). By 2022 election preference flows, Labor would have led by about 51.5–48.5.

Anthony Albanese’s net approval improved three points to -9, with 52% dissatisfied and 43% satisfied. Peter Dutton’s net approval slid four points to -18. Albanese led Dutton as better PM by 49–38 (47–38 previously).

This is Albanese’s best net approval in Newspoll since September 2024, Dutton’s worst since October 2023 and Albanese’s biggest better PM lead since May 2024. Here is the graph of Albanese’s net approval in Newspoll this term with a trend line.

The budget itself was not well received, with a net 10 points saying it would be bad for the economy (zero for the previous budget in May 2024) and a net 19 points bad for you personally (two previously). However, a net nine points said the Coalition would not have delivered a better budget (six previously).

There have been three polls released since the budget, with Labor gaining the lead in Newspoll, making a big gain for a tie in Resolve, but not gaining in Freshwater. The trend in the polls to Labor prior to the budget was clear, and Newspoll and Resolve confirmed this trend. Here is the poll graph.

The gains for Labor are probably in spite of the poorly rated budget. I believe US President Donald Trump is the most important reason for Labor’s gains in the last month, owing to his tariffs and associated stock market falls.

Resolve poll: Labor makes big gain from outlier for a tie

A national Resolve poll for Nine newspapers, conducted March 26–29 from a sample of 3,237 (double the usual sample size), had a 50–50 tie by respondent preferences, a five-point gain for Labor from the previous Resolve poll in late February, a pro-Coalition outlier.

Primary votes were 37% Coalition (down two), 29% Labor (up four), 13% Greens (steady), 7% One Nation (down two), 9% independents (steady) and 5% others (up one). By 2022 election flows, Labor led by 51–49, a three-point gain for Labor.

Albanese’s net approval was up 11 points since February to -11, with 49% saying his performance was poor and 38% good. Dutton’s net approval slumped 15 points to -10. Albanese led Dutton by 42–33 as preferred PM, a reversal of Dutton’s 39–34 lead in February. This is Albanese’s biggest lead since April 2024.

The Liberals led Labor on economic management and keeping the cost of living low, but their leads were much reduced. They led on economic management by 36–29 (41–24 previously). On cost of living, the Liberals led by 31–27 (37–25 previously). Treasurer Jim Chalmers had a net +6 approval, while shadow treasurer Angus Taylor was at net -6.

Freshwater poll steady at 51–49 to Coalition

A national Freshwater poll for The Financial Review, conducted March 28–30 from a sample of 1,059, gave the Coalition a 51–49 lead, unchanged from the previous Freshwater poll two weeks ago. An unrounded figure of 50.6–49.4 to the Coalition was provided.

Primary votes were 39% Coalition (steady), 32% Labor (up one), 12% Greens (down two) and 17% for all Others (up one). By 2022 election flows, this poll would be about a 50–50 tie.

In contrast to trends in other polls, both leaders were at -11 net approval, which was down one for Albanese and up one for Dutton. Albanese led Dutton by 46–45 as preferred PM (45.9–42.5 previously).

The Coalition led Labor by six points on cost of living, a two-point gain for Labor. They led on the economy by 11 points, a two-point gain for the Coalition.

The polls below were all conducted before Tuesday’s budget.

YouGov MRP poll puts Labor just one seat short of a majority

YouGov conducted a national MRP poll (multi-level modelling with post-stratification) from February 27 to March 26 from an overall sample of 38,629. MRP polls are used to estimate the outcome in each House of Representatives electorate using huge samples and modelling.

YouGov’s central forecast if the election were held now is Labor winning 75 of the 150 lower house seats, one short of a majority. The Coalition would win 60 seats, the Greens two, independents 11 and others two. Since YouGov’s previous MRP poll that was taken from late January to mid-February, Labor is up nine seats, the Coalition down 13 and independents up four.

The high forecast for Labor is 80 seats and 68 for the Coalition, while the low forecast is 69 for Labor and 55 for the Coalition. This poll is not a prediction of the election result, as the polls could change before the election.

The overall vote share in this MRP poll was 50.2–49.8 to Labor, a 1.9% swing to the Coalition since the 2022 election, but a 1.3% swing to Labor since the last MRP poll. Primary votes were 35.5% Coalition (down 1.9), 29.8% Labor (up 0.7), 13.2% Greens (up 0.5), 9.3% One Nation (up 0.2), 8.3% independents (down 0.6) and 3.9% others (up 1.1).

Although Labor’s share of Greens and One Nation preferences has risen since the last MRP poll, by 2022 election flows this poll would have Labor further ahead, by 51.5–48.5.

Redbridge poll: Labor maintains narrow lead

A national Redbridge poll, conducted March 13–24 from a sample of 2,039, gave Labor a 51–49 lead, unchanged from the previous Redbridge poll in early March. Primary votes were 38% Coalition (up one), 34% Labor (up two), 11% Greens (down one) and 17% for all Others (down two).

By 54–29, voters were unable to identify something the Labor government had done since its election in May 2022 that had made their lives better. Of those who could identify something, 36% selected electricity rebates, with 11% for the next most popular.

By 35–23, voters opposed the government placing tariffs on goods imported into Australia. By 68–24, voters were concerned about Chinese naval ships sailing down Australia’s east coast and conducting live fire drills.

Seat polls of teal-held Kooyong and Goldstein

The Poll Bludger reported Saturday that JWS polled the Victorian teal-held seats of Kooyong and Goldstein “a fortnight ago” from samples of 800 each for Australian Energy Producers. In Kooyong, teal Monique Ryan led the Liberals by 51–49, while in Goldstein the Liberals led teal Zoe Daniel by 54–46.

The Kooyong poll agrees well with the YouGov MRP, but the YouGov MRP had Daniel leading by 54.5–45.5 in Goldstein. The March 8 WA election indicated the Coalition would do worse in swing terms in affluent inner city seats.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Some Gen Zs are taking a ‘micro-retirement’. It’s one way to address burnout – but it comes with risks,https://theconversation.com/some-gen-zs-are-taking-a-micro-retirement-its-one-way-to-address-burnout-but-it-comes-with-risks-252505,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 19:08:00 GMT","For young people in the early stages of their career, the idea of waiting 40 years or more to retire might feel like a marathon. For those already feeling burnt out, it can be an excruciating thought.

So – why not take a break or two somewhere along the way?

The concept of “micro-retirement” is having a moment. While the term appears to have been first coined in 2007, it’s recently found new popularity on social media.

The idea is that retirement doesn’t have to be a fixed, clearly defined period at the end of your working life. Rather, it’s possible to restore your human energy and levels of wellbeing by dipping in and out of it, with small or large career breaks.

Many onlookers have pointed out that the underlying concept is not a new idea. Sabbaticals and other kinds of career breaks have been a feature of the workforce for a long time.

However, the trend gripping some of the Gen Z workforce on social media appears to be slightly different. And while it’s trying to solve some legitimate problems, it could also carry some unique risks.

Taking a break

The notion that rest is crucial – that humans shouldn’t just work themselves into the ground – is very old indeed.

Major religions around the world have long preached the importance of rest and restoration for human beings to survive the hardship of paid work.

Career breaks, however, are a bit different from the ordinary rest opportunities we get such as weekends, public holidays and annual leave. There are a few different types.

The first is the full-time career break, such as a sabbatical. This is where an employee, in consultation with their employer, hits pause for an extended period.

This might be to enjoy travel, develop new hobbies or complete training necessary for career progression. However, the company typically continues to pay a salary (or a percentage of it) during the mutually agreed period.

In Australia, many employees are entitled to paid long service leave after serving between seven and 10 years with the same employer, depending on which state or territory they’re in.

Taking a full-time job part-time, can also constitute a kind of career break for some. This is where an employee reduces their working hours or days and earns reduced pay compared to full-time work.

Other types of long-term leave can include parental leave and leave for medical assistance.

In Belgium, a government scheme allows employees to take a career break of up to a year, during which they receive a paid allowance from the government. Previous research into the scheme showed 76% of employees taking full-time career breaks from both public and private sectors were aged between 25 and 49.

Micro-retirement might be different

When Gen Z is talking about micro-retirement, they often aren’t talking about exactly the same thing as a paid, mutually agreed sabbatical.

For many, micro-retirement is a voluntary choice to terminate their employment and support their living through personal savings or government support.

But they are trying to solve similar problems: the health and wellbeing risks associated with pushing too hard – or for too long – at work.

Research by the World Health Organization found the number of deaths from heart disease and stroke that could be attributed to long working hours increased by 29% between 2000 and 2016.

Read more: What's the difference between burnout and depression?

The energy ceiling

My own previous research has examined the “ceiling effect” of human energy. This is when an employee’s energy depletion reaches a tipping point due to their work and begins to affect their wellbeing.

When employees reach the tipping point, or ceiling effect at work, they often use coffee and alcohol as a coping mechanism. This has long-term negative impacts on health.

Sleep also becomes a problem, which can lead to “presenteeism” – where employees show up physically to work but function poorly. This can cost businesses in lost employee productivity.

Flexible or hybrid work can be a double-edged sword that leads to intrusion on home life.

Like any extended break, micro-retirement is a way to replenish or restore the energy depleted. Research into Belgium’s career break scheme found it did improve individual physical and mental health – but it’s important to remember this scheme paid an allowance.

What are the risks?

Micro-retirement might be a new label. But drawing parallels from research into career breaks, there is evidence of so-called “scarring” effects.

This is where the future wages of an individual attempting to re-enter the job market after a career break may be lower than if they had an uninterrupted career.

This can impact physical and mental health, and lead to lower income levels in retirement.

Businesses may not be too inclined to develop policies to implement paid career breaks such as sabbaticals. That may lead more young people to take their own unpaid breaks.

Outside of taking extended breaks, there’s a broader discussion to be had about increasing productivity by redesigning the way we work every day with sustainability and flexibility in mind.

It’s crucial there are ways for employees to disengage from work on a daily basis to restore and replenish their energy.",theconversation

Not only do they oversee students’ progress, but they are also responsible for the performance of staff and the wellbeing of everyone at their school. Their jobs are huge.

As we have previously tracked in our annual survey of principals, their jobs are also extremely stressful and they are subject to regular abuse – often from parents.

Our latest survey shows these trends are not changing. And more than 50% of those we surveyed are seriously thinking about quitting.

Our research

Since 2011, we have surveyed Australian school leaders. This includes principals, deputy principals, and other school leaders such as heads of junior or senior schools.

In our new report, we surveyed almost 2,200 people, which is more than 20% of Australian school leaders. In 2024, we surveyed primary and high school leaders from government, independent and Catholic schools all around the country.

This makes it the most comprehensive data set on principals’ health and wellbeing in Australia. It is also the longest-running survey of its type in the world.

High workloads and stress

Previous surveys have shown school principals face unsustainably high workloads and high levels of stress. Unfortunately, these trends continue in our latest 2024 results.

School leaders work an average of 54.5 hours a week during term time and 20.6 hours during holidays. They nominated the “sheer quantity of work” as the biggest source of their stress.

This was closely followed by “lack of time to focus on teaching and learning” and “student-related issues”.

As a high school principal from Western Australia told us:

I do love what I do however it is a seriously difficult role and only getting harder.

Generalised anxiety and depression reports have also increased from last year’s survey. Severe anxiety was reported by 14.8% of participants, up from 11.4% in 2023. Moderate depression is reported by 11.1% of participants, up from 10.6%.

Critical incidents

For the first time, our 2024 survey asked principals about the number of “critical incidents” they have to deal with. These are defined as an “often unexpected event that may involve loss or threat to wellbeing or personal goals”.

Nearly three-quarters (73.7%) said they had experienced a critical incident while in their role. The most common type of incident was violence and security threats (43.9%). Suicide and suicidal threats represented 12.6% of reported incidents. Participants also reported medical emergencies (10.3%) and custody or child-protection incidents (7%).

As one NSW principal told us:

I think it is untenable for principals to continue to be under constant stress at this level and am aware that many of my colleagues are also retiring or considering retiring. I have only just turned 59 and would like to work for another 5-10 years but can’t continue due to the ridiculous workload and pressure.

Schools are not safe for principals

An increasing number of principals report being subject to offensive behaviours that are unacceptable in any workplace – let alone one that involves children and young people.

Nearly 55% reported they are subjected to threats of violence, 57% are subjected to gossip and slander, and 35% are subjected to cyberbullying. These are the highest levels we have ever reported.

When asked “from whom”, more than 65% of school leaders said parents and caregivers. Students also contribute, but unfortunately, so do staff. They were the source of 29% of “gossip and slander” reported by school leaders.

As one ACT school leader told us:

The major cause of distress are parents. Parents behave in an unreasonable manner, have ridiculous expectations and think that because they went to school they can therefore run a school. Principals are constantly defending staff from parents. Parents are rarely told to stop and desist by Education Support Offices.

Many prinicpals want to leave

In 2023, we first asked the question whether school leaders seriously consider leaving their job. More than half (56%) agreed or strongly agreed with the statement.

It’s pleasing to report this has reduced slightly to 53% nationally, but the trend is, unfortunately, not consistent across the country.

For example, the figure in NSW has dropped from 63% to 51%, but in Victoria it has increased from 48% to 54%. Policymakers across jurisdictions could benefit from working together to address these findings, to see what is working and what is not.

How can we help?

The demands on today’s school principals are significant – the work takes an emotional toll – and this means we need different approaches to supporting them.

It’s why we recommend education departments and school boards provide “reflective supervision” for school leaders. This gives professionals a regular chance to reflect on what they are doing with a confidential and experienced practitioner in the field, which in this case would be another experienced school leader.

This is a widespread practice in other demanding workplaces, such as family violence, healthcare, and child mental health. Practitioners in these fields benefit through improved management of their own wellbeing, which in turn helps them support their clients and patients.

We also need to make sure governments regularly and routinely consult principals about education policy.

Schools and education departments should also explore alternative models to make the job more sustainable. This could include co-principals or job sharing models.

Without change, too many leaders will leave too quickly, without anyone left to replace them.",theconversation

The resulting Budapest Open Access Initiative opened with the words: “An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an unprecedented public good”.

This was the first definition of open access and referred to harnessing the internet to make scientific research openly available, without a subscription. It was a “statement of principle, a statement of strategy, and a statement of commitment”.

More than two decades later, the open access movement has broadened beyond simply research articles. It now incorporates research data, protocols, software and all aspects of the research process. The universal term for this is “open science”.

With its focus on transparency, open science offers part of the solution to the growing problem of scientific misconduct.

A system that enables misconduct

Academic institutions and researchers are focused on a very narrow set of metrics for success. These come down to authorship on a publication being the most valued currency in academia because this is the primary measure towards career progression and academic prestige.

Another industry resulting from these metrics is the international university ranking systems. These are run by commercial organisations that publish lists of universities, which in turn promote their institution as being in the “top X%” of whichever list they have done well in.

Despite widespread criticism, these systems continue to give institutions incentive to reward their academics for publishing in certain journals for the purpose of raising their rank.

This “publish or perish” push is undermining science.

For example, it has opened up several exploitative industries, such as predatory publishers. These are entities that exploit authors by charging fees for publication without providing adequate editorial services.

Also on the rise are covert entities known as “paper mills”, which manufacture academic articles (either using a human or a machine) and submit them to journals on behalf of paying researchers. This causes serious issues for editors who need to work through an increasing number of rubbish articles to choose which ones are genuine before sending them out for review by other researchers.

These paper mills create major problems for the scientific record. Some experts believe they are also illegal.

Many of the current problems with research integrity were highlighted by a 2024 study, which estimated that as many as one in seven papers is based on suspect data. A whole new area of research called forensic scientometrics has developed to try to identify some of these questionable publishing practices.

Science does have a way of correcting itself through retractions, where a problematic paper is withdrawn from the journal and a retraction notice put up instead. But identifying problem papers is only part of the solution. For example, one 2024 study found less than 5% of all papers identified as retracted were actually removed from journal websites.

Working openly improves science

So how can making science more open and transparent help?

When we talk about research integrity, we often look to the integrity of the researcher – expecting them to show “moral character”. However, ultimately it is the integrity of the research itself that really matters.

Working in an open environment helps research integrity in several ways.

Making the data used for the work freely available means the work can be better scrutinised. This is something that would have helped prevent the publication of the now-retracted study in The Lancet examining whether the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine was effective at treating COVID. The study was retracted after investigations revealed the data the research was based on was deeply flawed and unable to be verified.

Requiring clinical trials to be registered means drug studies that are unfavourable or show no effect cannot be buried.

Reviewing the “instruction manuals” of how research studies are going to be conducted, called the protocols, before the studies are undertaken also ensures more rigorous research. That’s because the quality of the protocols determines the robustness of the work.

These are just a few of the ways open science creates an environment where poor research practice is much harder to undertake.

Working openly won’t necessarily stop bad actors. But it will make it much harder for them to operate without being noticed.

A true paradigm shift

A 2022 study on open access policies in Australian universities showed only 50% had an open access policy at the time, even though this is a requirement under the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research.

Despite this, there is some hope for open science in Australia.

For example, in 2024, the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia convened a roundtable event to discuss how to transition to a fair and equitable open research system. This led to the formation of the National Open Science Taskforce, which is currently co-ordinating open activity in Australia.

Internationally, the European Union was an early advocate for open science, beginning work on the European Open Science Cloud in 2015.

Individual European countries are forging ahead, with The Netherlands having a National Open Science program and Ireland launching its National Framework on the Transition to an Open Research Environment in 2019.

The EU-funded Open and Universal Science is being implemented by a consortium of 18 organisations across the world. It’s due to be completed this year.

Countries worldwide also submitted their first reports last month on their implementation of the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science.

Open science is a radical departure from traditional research practices. As the summary report of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia’s roundtable event says, transitioning to it requires “a true paradigm and cultural shift”.

But for the sake of improving research integrity, this shift is urgently needed.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Brisbane 2032 is no longer legally bound to be ‘climate positive’. Will it still leave a green legacy?,https://theconversation.com/brisbane-2032-is-no-longer-legally-bound-to-be-climate-positive-will-it-still-leave-a-green-legacy-246672,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 19:10:45 GMT","When Brisbane was awarded the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, it came with a widely publicised landmark promise: the world’s first “climate-positive” games.

The International Olympic Committee had already announced all games would be climate-positive from 2030. It said this meant the games would be required to “go beyond” the previous obligation of reducing carbon emissions directly related to their operations and offsetting or otherwise “compensating” for the rest.

In other words, achieving net-zero was no longer sufficient. Now each organising committee would be legally required to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than the games emit. This is in keeping with the most widely cited definition of climate-positive.

Both Paris 2024 and Los Angeles 2028 made voluntary pledges. But Brisbane 2032 was the first contractually required to be climate-positive. This was enshrined in the original 2021 Olympic Host Contract, an agreement between the IOC, the State of Queensland, Brisbane City Council and the Australian Olympic Committee.

But the host contract has quietly changed since. All references to “climate-positive” have been replaced with weaker terminology. The move was not publicly announced. This fits a broader pattern of Olympic Games promising big on sustainability before weakening or abandoning commitments over time.

A quiet retreat from climate positive

Research by my team has shown the climate-positive announcement sparked great hope for the future of Brisbane as a regenerative city. We saw Brisbane 2032 as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to radically shift away from the ongoing systemic issues underlying urban development.

This vision to embrace genuinely sustainable city design centred on fostering circular economies and net positive development. It would have aligned urban development with ecological stewardship. Beyond just mitigating environmental harm, the games could have set a new standard for sustainability by becoming a catalyst to actively regenerate the natural environment.

Yet, on December 7 2023, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) initiated an addendum to the host contract. It effectively downgraded the games’ sustainability obligations.

It was signed by Brisbane City Council, the State of Queensland, the Australian Olympic Committee and the IOC between April and May 2024.

Asked about these amendments, the IOC replied it “took the decision to no longer use the term ‘climate-positive’ when referring to its climate commitments”.

But the IOC maintains that: “The requirements underpinning this term, however, and our ambition to address the climate crisis, have not changed”.

It said the terminology was changed to ensure that communications “are transparent and easily understood; that they focus on the actions implemented to reduce carbon emissions; and that they are aligned with best practice and current regulations, as well as the principle of continual improvement”.

Similarly, a Brisbane 2032 spokesperson told The Conversation the language was changed:

to ensure we are communicating in a transparent and easily understood manner, following advice from the International Olympic Committee and recommendations of the United Nations and European Union Green Claims Directive, made in 2023. Brisbane 2032 will continue to plan, as we always have, to deliver a Games that focus on specific measures to deliver a more sustainable Games.

But the new wording commits Brisbane 2032 to merely “aiming at removing more carbon from the atmosphere than what the Games project emits”.

Crucially, this is no longer binding. The new language makes carbon removal an optional goal rather than a contractual requirement.

Aiming high, yet falling short

Olympic Games have adopted increasingly ambitious sustainability rhetoric. Yet, action in the real world typically falls short.

In our ongoing research with the Politecnico di Torino, Italy, we analysed sustainability commitments since the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. We found they often change over time. Initial promises are either watered down or abandoned altogether due to political, financial, and logistical pressures.

Construction activities for the Winter Olympic Games 2014 in Sochi, Russia, irreversibly damaged the Western Caucasus – a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Rio 2016 failed to clean up Guanabara Bay, despite its original pledge to reduce pollutants by 80%. Rio also caused large-scale deforestation and wetland destruction. Ancient forests were cleared for PyeongChang 2018 ski slopes.

Our research found a persistent gap between sustainability rhetoric and reality. Brisbane 2032 fits this pattern as the original promise of hosting climate-positive games is at risk of reverting to business as usual.

Victoria Park controversy

In 2021, a KPMG report for the Queensland government analysed the potential economic, social and environmental benefits of the Brisbane 2032 games.

It said the government was proposing to deliver the climate-positive commitment required to host the 2032 games through a range of initiatives. This included “repurposing and upgrading existing infrastructure with enhanced green star credentials”.

But plans for the Olympic stadium have changed a great deal since then. Plans to upgrade the Brisbane Cricket Ground, commonly known as the Gabba, have been replaced by a new stadium to be built in Victoria Park.

Victoria Park is Brisbane’s largest remaining inner-city green space. It is known to Indigenous peoples as Barrambin (the windy place). It is listed on the Queensland Heritage Register due to its great cultural significance.

Page 90 of the Olympic Host Contract prohibits permanent construction “in statutory nature areas, cultural protected areas and World Heritage sites”.

Local community groups and environmental advocates have vowed to fight plans for a Victoria Park stadium. This may include a legal challenge.

Save Victoria Park

What next?

The climate-positive commitment has been downgraded to an unenforceable aspiration. A new Olympic stadium has been announced in direct violation of the host contract. Will Brisbane 2032 still leave a green legacy?

Greater transparency and public accountability are needed. Otherwise, the original plan may fall short of the positive legacy it aspired to, before the Olympics even begin.",theconversation

How NZ’s cultural organisations can maintain integrity and still make money,https://theconversation.com/art-for-arts-sake-how-nzs-cultural-organisations-can-maintain-integrity-and-still-make-money-252362,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 18:22:20 GMT","When Auckland mayor Wayne Brown said in 2022 that the Auckland Art Gallery had the foot traffic of a corner dairy and cast the institution as an “uneconomic” entity, he conceded he was at risk of “being seen as something of a philistine”.

But the mayor’s comments also highlighted a very real challenge. How can New Zealand cultural organisations secure their future when the value of art and culture is seen through the economic lens of profit?

And does an overemphasis on profit make cultural groups wary of market and strategy, hampering innovation in the art and culture sector?

Our research proposes a concept we call “generative coexistence”. We suggest that when market approaches are integrated thoughtfully, market forces and cultural missions can work together and enable each other.

Why the market vs. culture debate is changing

For years, cultural organisations were shielded from the market by state funding. But while government support remained relatively consistent, there was no consistent funding strategy. With each budget round being akin to a lottery, calls for change are becoming louder.

The 2024 budget included significant reductions in arts funding. Cultural organisations were expected to find new ways to stay viable. However, as art institutions turn to practices like sponsorship, ticketed events and merchandising to boost revenue, there’s understandable concern about a potential loss of artistic integrity.

Yet, market principles and cultural values can be aligned.

In 2023, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra launched a digital platform, NZSO+, to stream performances, open rehearsals and artistic talks. Later that year, the NZSO performed to a flock of farm chickens, to support ethical farming and, simultaneously, modernise its brand image.

The moves raised questions about whether the orchestra’s essence could be nurtured outside of concert halls. At the same time, they showed a possibility for cultural organisations to blend their authentic mission with commercial acumen, without compromising their intrinsic values.

The NZSO’s streaming strategy didn’t just address a budget shortfall. It allowed the orchestra to reach wider, younger and more diverse audiences who might not otherwise engage with classical music. Through this market-driven approach, the symphony orchestra sustained its core mission of bringing music to all New Zealanders.

Our research includes examples of cultural groups from around the world. It captures how, rather than seeing commercialisation as a “necessary evil” undermining the arts, cultural groups can use the tensions that come from the competing demands to produce creative solutions.

Here, generative coexistence allows cultural organisations to adapt in ways that not only keep the lights on but also broaden their impact.

Generative coexistence in the arts

We identified three main strategies for organisations in the arts and culture sector designed to help them thrive in a world where financial and cultural goals can seem at odds with each other.

First, organisations need to embrace the commercial potential of cultural products.

When approached thoughtfully, the strong commercial appeal of cultural products can support an organisation’s core mission and create a democratic counterbalance against sponsorship dependency.

Wellington’s Te Papa Museum, for example, creates value through blockbuster ticketed exhibitions that attract a wider audience – such as last year’s Dinosaurs of Patagonia. By using selective commodification processes, Te Papa maintains its educational and cultural status and generates the revenue needed to innovate and expand its reach.

Cultural organisations also need to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset.

Organisations worldwide experiment with innovating existing business models to allow for creative and operational freedom. For example, performing art organisations are increasingly moving away from legacy models – such as venue-based events with tickets as the key revenue stream – into hybrid and digitally-led ones.

Similarly, galleries and art spaces are opting for nomadic models, eschewing permanent locations but maintaining a strong online presence. This enables cultural actors to adapt and lower reliance on funding while creating cultural value.

Finally, cultural organisations need to look into cross-disciplinary collaborations that align on shared goals. Finding a balance between financial stability and cultural integrity requires recognising opportunities to work together.

How market and cultural values can coexist

The New Zealand arts sector is still cautious about non-intuitive collaborations with adjacent fields, such as gaming, fashion or advertising. But partnering with the tech industry holds the promise of new levels of visitor engagement, while staying rooted in the commitment to community enrichment.

Cultural organisations have to navigate a complex landscape where financial pressures and cultural missions intersect and create tensions.

Our concept of generative coexistence encourages a more flexible view. Examples from around the globe show it isn’t about choosing between culture and commerce. It’s about turning tensions into a foundation for innovation, accessibility and resilience.

Arts and culture are neither luxuries nor commodities, but integral parts of a thriving society. We are certain that New Zealand’s creative sector, which is unique, resilient and economically viable, can secure its place in a future that honours both the power of art and the realities of financial sustainability.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Foreign aid cuts could mean 10 million more HIV infections by 2030 – and almost 3 million extra deaths,https://theconversation.com/foreign-aid-cuts-could-mean-10-million-more-hiv-infections-by-2030-and-almost-3-million-extra-deaths-253017,"Sat, 30 Mar 2030 00:00:00 GMT","In January, the Trump administration ordered a broad pause on all US funding for foreign aid.

Among other issues, this has significant effects on US funding for HIV. The United States has been the world’s biggest donor to international HIV assistance, providing 73% of funding in 2023.

A large part of this is the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which oversees programs in low- and middle-income countries to prevent, diagnose and treat the virus. These programs have been significantly disrupted.

What’s more, recent funding cuts for international HIV assistance go beyond the US. Five countries that provide the largest amount of foreign aid for HIV – the US, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Netherlands – have announced cuts of between 8% and 70% to international aid in 2025 and 2026.

Together, this may mean a 24% reduction in international HIV spending, in addition to the US foreign aid pause.

We wanted to know how these cuts might affect HIV infections and deaths in the years to come. In a new study, we found the worst-case scenario could see more than 10 million extra infections than what we’d otherwise anticipate in the next five years, and almost 3 million additional deaths.

What is HIV?

HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system. HIV can be transmitted at birth, during unprotected sex or thorough blood-to-blood contact such as shared needles.

If left untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), a condition in which the immune system is severely damaged, and which can be fatal.

HIV was the world’s deadliest infectious disease in the early 1990s. There’s still no cure for HIV, but modern treatments allow the virus to be suppressed with a daily pill. People with HIV who continue treatment can live without symptoms and don’t risk infecting others.

A sustained global effort towards awareness, prevention, testing and treatment has reduced annual new HIV infections by 39% (from 2.1 million in 2010 to 1.3 million in 2023), and annual deaths by 51% (from 1.3 million to 630,000).

Most of that drop happened in sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic was worst. Today, nearly two-thirds of people with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, and nearly all live in low- and middle-income countries.

Our study

We wanted to estimate the impact of recent funding cuts from the US, UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands on HIV infections and deaths. To do this, we used our mathematical model for 26 low- and middle-income countries. The model includes data on international HIV spending as well as data on HIV cases and deaths.

These 26 countries represent roughly half of all people living with HIV in low- and middle income countries, and half of international HIV spending. We set up each country model in collaboration with national HIV/AIDS teams, so the data sources reflected the best available local knowledge. We then extrapolated our findings from the 26 countries we modelled to all low- and middle-income countries.

For each country, we first projected the number of new HIV infections and deaths that would occur if HIV spending stayed the same.

Second, we modelled scenarios for anticipated cuts based on a 24% reduction in international HIV funding for each country.

Finally, we modelled scenarios for the possible immediate discontinuation of PEPFAR in addition to other anticipated cuts.

With the 24% cuts and PEPFAR discontinued, we estimated there could be 4.43 million to 10.75 million additional HIV infections between 2025 and 2030, and 770,000 to 2.93 million extra HIV-related deaths. Most of these would be because of cuts to treatment. For children, there could be up to an additional 882,400 infections and 119,000 deaths.

In the more optimistic scenario in which PEPFAR continues but 24% is still cut from international HIV funding, we estimated there could be 70,000 to 1.73 million extra new HIV infections and 5,000 to 61,000 additional deaths between 2025 and 2030. This would still be 50% higher than if current spending were to continue.

The wide range in our estimates reflects low- and middle-income countries committing to far more domestic funding for HIV in the best case, or broader health system dysfunction and a sustained gap in funding for HIV treatment in the worst case.

Some funding for HIV treatment may be saved by taking that money from HIV prevention efforts, but this would have other consequences.

The range also reflects limitations in the available data, and uncertainty within our analysis. But most of our assumptions were cautious, so these results likely underestimate the true impacts of funding cuts to HIV programs globally.

Sending progress backwards

If funding cuts continue, the world could face higher rates of annual new HIV infections by 2030 (up to 3.4 million) than at the peak of the global epidemic in 1995 (3.3 million).

Sub-Saharan Africa will experience by far the greatest effects due to the high proportion of HIV treatment that has relied on international funding.

In other regions, we estimate vulnerable groups such as people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and trans and gender diverse people may experience increases in new HIV infections that are 1.3 to 6 times greater than the general population.

Will Oliver/EPA

The Asia-Pacific received US$591 million in international funding for HIV in 2023, which is the second highest after sub-Saharan Africa. So this region would likely experience a substantial rise in HIV as a result of anticipated funding cuts.

Notably, more than 10% of new HIV infections among people born in Australia are estimated to have been acquired overseas. More HIV in the region is likely to mean more HIV in Australia.

But concern is greatest for countries that are most acutely affected by HIV and AIDS, many of which will be most affected by international funding cuts.",theconversation

https://theconversation.com,"Microsoft, the first fifty years",https://theconversation.com/microsoft-les-cinquante-premieres-annees-252827,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:46:10 GMT","Insubmersible. Even the GAFA wave has not really reached Microsoft. Fifty years after its creation, an eternity in the world of tech, the firm of Bill Gates and Paul Allen is still there and well there. Back on what is called across the Atlantic, a success story with a few failures.

This week, Microsoft is celebrating its 50th anniversary. This article was written on Microsoft Word, from a computer equipped with Microsoft Windows, and it will probably be published on platforms hosted by Microsoft Azure, including Linkedin, a subsidiary of Microsoft which has more than a billion users. That is to say the influence of this company which, in 2024, gave a net profit of $ 88 billion for a turnover of 245 billion. Its stock market value is silent the $ 3,000 billion, making it the second stock market valuation in the world, behind Apple and almost equally with Nvidia. Its cumulative profits since 2002 have been approaching $ 640 billion.

However, 50 years ago, Microsoft was only a very small computer company founded in Albuquerque, in New Mexico (and not in California) by two former students of Harvard, Bill Gates and Paul Allen, aged 19 and 22 respectively. The adventures that have enabled it to become one of the most powerful companies in the world are multiple, and they can be collected in four times.

First era: Bill Gates climbs on the shoulders of IBM

At the end of the 1970s, the undisputed leader in IT, IBM, realized that the microcomputers proposed by the young Entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, like Apple II, may ultimately shade its large systems. The IBM PC project was then launched. Quickly, it appears that the heaviness of the internal processes of the company will not allow him to deliver a microcomputer in time. It is then decided that the different components of the machine can be subcontracted to external suppliers.

For the operating system, several specialized companies are requested, but all refuse to work with IBM, which they consider the enemy to be killed, symbol of centralized and bureaucratic computing. It was then that Mary Maxwell Gates, who sits on the board of directors of an NGO next to the president of IBM, suggests the name of her son William, nicknamed Bill, who has just created Microsoft. A first contact was made in 1980.

Problem, Microsoft is not at all specialist in operating systems, but Basic programming language. Never mind: Bill Gates, with an incredible cheek, agrees to sign with IBM to deliver an operating system that he does not have. He bought the QDOS system, from the company Seattle Computer Products, from which it develops MS-DOS (MS for Microsoft).

Second poker stroke, Bill Gates, whose father is a founding partner of a large Seattle law firm, offers IBM a contract which provides that the use of MS-DOS will not be exclusive, which gives him the right to sell it to other IT companies. IBM, little used to subcontracting, does not be wary. This contract will make Microsoft's fortune and IBM's misfortune: COMPAQ, OLIVETTI or Hewlett-Packard hasten to develop clones of the IBM PC, giving birth to a real industry.

Carried by this formidable success (the image of IBM seriously seduces companies, and Microsoft affects a fee on each PC sold), the company is introduced on the stock market in 1986. Bill Gates, Paul Allen and two of their first employees become billionaires and 12,000 other employees of Microsoft, millionaires.

Second era: Windows, the golden egg chicken inherited from Xerox

In the mid-1980s, microcomputers were not very ergonomic: their operating systems, including Microsoft MS-DOS, operated with particularly forbidden control lines (the famous C:/). Everything changed in 1984 with the Apple Macintosh, equipped with a graphical interface (icons, drop -down menus, mouse, fonts, etc.). This revolutionary technology was developed in Xerox's research laboratory, but the photocopier giant did not understand its potential. Steve Jobs, the boss of Apple, was very largely inspired. To ensure the commercial success of the Macintosh, he asks Microsoft to develop a suitable version of his office suite, and in particular his Excel spreadsheet. This is how Microsoft recovers the principle of the graphical interface, which allows it to launch Windows 1 from 1985, soon accompanied by the Office suite (Word, Excel and PowerPoint).

Windows is improved throughout the following years, to peak with Windows 95, launched in 1995 with an advertising campaign of more than $ 200 million, for which Bill Gates buys the Rolling Stones the right to use their song ""Start Me Up"". Microsoft's global market share in operating systems then exceeds 70 %. She hasn't changed much since.

In 1997, Microsoft even paid the luxury of saving Apple from bankruptcy by investing $ 150 million in its capital in the form of actions without voting rights, which were sold three years later. Steve Jobs thanks Bill Gates during one of his famous Keynotes, saying: ""The world is better, thank you. Incidentally, this rescue makes it possible to end the trial that Apple had brought to Microsoft by accusing him of having copied his graphical interface to design Windows.

Third era: bureaucratization, internal conflicts and failed diversifications

In the mid -1990s, IT experienced a new transformation with the explosion of the web. However, Microsoft, a specialist in autonomous PCs, whose economic model is to sell boxes in boxes, is poorly prepared for this global networking. Its first reaction is the development of the Internet Explorer browser (in fact developed from the acquisition of the Mosaic browser designed by Spyglass, a bit like MS-DOS in its time). Internet Explorer ends up being integrated into Windows, which triggers a dominant position abuse that could have caused Microsoft's dismantling. New competitors, such as Google with its Chrome browser, take the opportunity to attract users.

In 2000, Bill Gates ceded his post as general manager of Microsoft to Steve Ballmer, one of his former Harvard comrades, who wishes to make it a business of electronic and services. For this, Ballmer leads during the following fifteen years a whole series of diversifications: video games (Flight Simulator), Encyclopedia on CD (inserta), computer equipment (mouse, keyboards), MP3 player (Zune), online accommodation (Azure), game console (Xbox), telephones (Windows Phone), tablets and computers (surface).

While some of these diversifications are successes (notably Azure and Xbox), others are stinging failures. Incarta is quickly overwhelmed by Wikipedia, the Zune cannot resist Apple's iPod, while Windows Phone remains one of the biggest strategic errors in the history of the company. Indeed, to ensure its success in telephony against the iPhone, Microsoft bought the ""mobile phones"" division of Finnish Nokia for $ 5.4 billion in September 2013. Integration is catastrophic. Steve Ballmer wants phones to use a version of Windows 10, which makes them as slow as it is not much ergonomic. Barely two years later, Microsoft stops his telephony activity, accusing a loss of $ 7.6 billion. Nokia is sold for only $ 350 million.

One of the consequences of these multiple diversifications is the explosion of Microsoft's workforce, which increased from 61,000 people in 2005 to 228,000 in 2024. Many internal conflicts broke out between the different divisions, which refuse to work together.

These wars of territories, coupled with an invasive bureaucratization and an effortless profitability (for each installation of Windows, PC manufacturers pay around 50 dollars, while the marginal cost of this license is virtually zero), bridage the innovation capacity of Microsoft. Its software, including Internet Explorer 6 or Windows Vista, is soon to be mocked by users for their imperfections, constantly clogged with frequent updates. As some point out, Windows is equipped with a ""safe"" mode, which suggests that its normal mode is ""with failure"".

Fourth era: Microsoft again cool thanks to Cloud and Openai?

In 2014, Satya Nadella replaced Steve Ballmer at the head of Microsoft. Coming from the online services division, he will redirect Microsoft's strategy in this direction, notably by developing the Azure accommodation activity. In 2024, Azure became the second cloud service in the world, behind AWS of Amazon, and more than 56 % of Microsoft's turnover came from its online services. Satya Nadella modifies the company's economic model on this occasion: now, software should no longer be sold, but accessible by subscription, which gives birth, for example, at Office 365 and Xbox Live.

At the same time, Microsoft acquired the Minecraft online game in 2014, then the LinkedIn professional social network in 2016 for $ 26.2 billion (which is its biggest acquisition to date), and the Github online development platform in 2018 for $ 7.5 billion.

Finally, between 2023 and 2025, Microsoft invests more than 14 billion in Openai, the company behind Chatgpt, which gives it a particularly enviable position in the revolution of artificial intelligence. Chatgpt models enrich Microsoft's internal AI, Copilot.

In total, in 50 years, thanks to a series of reckless bets, timely buyouts, but also failed diversifications, Microsoft has experienced a significant evolution of its strategy, whether in terms of perimeter, competitive advantage or economic model. A time suffocated by its opulence and internal conflicts, the company seems to become attractive again, especially for young graduates. However, nothing says that Microsoft will still exist for 50 new years. Besides, Bill Gates himself announced the opposite.",theconversation

Trump's administration suggests not reimbursing its creditors, of which China is a part. Are we witnessing the end of the supremacy of the dollar?

The new Trump administration is experimenting a lot in economic matters. She learned that customs duties, although they are increasing tax revenue, also generates internal problems. They lead to commercial reprisals, make foreign goods more expensive, and thus cause inflation - or an increase in prices. So far, so good.

A recent proposal now evokes a selective defect on American debt. According to the Financial Times quoting Bloomberg, Trump suggested that

""The Elon Musk team responsible for improving government efficiency would have found irregularities when examining data from the US Treasury Department, which could lead the United States to ignore certain payments.""

The term ""ignoring certain payments"" is an understatement. Clearly, this means considering a selective defect, in other words not to reimburse all their creditors ... individuals as well as state.

Not reimbursing your creditors allows you to voluntarily choose to pay some but no others. Trump evokes this as a means of geopolitical pressure or as a source of income for the state. The defect reduces national debt. But it’s a risky idea. She threatens confidence in the dollar. Who wants to buy state bonds that could be worth 0, depending on the mood of the sovereign?

Tax foreign investors

The economist Barry Eichengreen recently questioned the supremacy of the dollar on the first page of Financial Times, an event in itself. According to Eichengreen, Stephen Miran's proposal - Trump’s main economic adviser - taxing foreign holders of federal treasure titles would risk compromising international financial stability. The goal is to devalue the dollar to make American exports more competitive. Officially, the administration plans a ""commission of use"" levied on interest paid to foreign investors. It would be necessary to pay to use the dollar, owned by the United States.

The Trump government plays on words by reversing the ""Commission of Use"" tax. This direct debit on interest makes it possible to avoid international tax treaties. In practice, it is only foreign investors who pay. Disguised discrimination.

As Brad Setser has recently shown it on the social network Threads, more than half of American debt holders-holders of United States Treasury bonds-are individuals or American companies ... who are likely to be spared by this defect. So who else has this debt? Two governments are at the top of the list: Japan and China.

China: 4 % of American bonds

Japan is still an allied country for the time being and could be exempt. Even if the Trump administration shows less enthusiasm towards Europe and its historic partners, the geopolitical alliance with the United States could still play a role.

China, on the other hand, still holds around 4 % of American obligations in circulation. If this figure may seem low, it represents a considerable sum. More importantly, China has money at stake, with more than $ 700 billion placed in its official exchange reserves, probably higher, taking into account unofficial reserves. Chinese semi-public institutions, such as banks and large companies, potentially hold even higher amounts.

Brad Setser recently indicated on threads that China gradually reduces its assets to American treasury bills. We do not know the exact amounts sold, but the transactions passing through Euroclear, in Belgium, offer an overview. Since 2014, China is actually seems to gradually disengage from the US dollar. It has gone from a creditor with 18 % of American shares to a little more than 4 % today.

China remains the second foreign holder of American bonds. Imagine now that Doge's geniuses or others close to Trump decide, for reasons of domestic policy, a selective defect in China.

Premises with Ukraine

Geopolitics could play in two directions. China would reduce its exhibition before ideologues close to Trump took the initiative. Alternatively, she would pursue her own geopolitical objectives by preventing this risk preventively in the event of future tensions.

Russia also liquidated all of its American obligations before invading Ukraine. The risk of selective defect or financial attack was too large. When I was at the Central Bank, my colleagues and I only realized it after the invasion, although the information was before our eyes (which we had presented in an article after the fact).

Towards a sale of American bonds?

China still has a large amount of American bonds. If she hesitated to undertake this daring geopolitical maneuver, she would approach a situation where, from a financial point of view, the green light would be given. The idea of ​​a selective defect could thus accelerate sales of American bonds by China.

If a selective defect should actually occur, the geopolitical consequences would not necessarily be the first concern. It would mean above all that the very gasoline of financial investments worldwide would be upset. The obligations of the American treasury represent, by definition, the safest asset available, according to macroeconomics.

If this active active person who was to fail, capital would immediately seek refuge elsewhere without necessarily finding it. For example, there are not enough German treasury bills, and those from other countries are more risky. This corresponds precisely to the definition of a global financial crisis. We are certainly not there yet. But if the Trump administration was to experiment with selective faults as it does with customs duties, the consequences would be much more catastrophic and immediate.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,"We inherit the genetics of our parents, but what about epigenetics?",https://theconversation.com/nous-heritons-de-la-genetique-de-nos-parents-mais-quid-de-lepigenetique-247948,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:36:10 GMT","Epigenetic marks are DNA chemical changes that will allow certain genes to be activated or extinguished. They are reproduced when the cells divide but can they be between two generations?

Based on genetic information, DNA is the founding molecule of earthly life. However, it cannot work alone, because its information must be interpreted by proteins present in the nucleus of cells, adding additional information that is called epigenetic information (""epis"" from the Greek prefix which means ""above"").

At each generation, we inherit the DNA contained in the chromosomes of our two parents, in the form of 23 chromosomes of the mother and 23 chromosomes of the father, to lead to the 46 chromosomes of the human species (this number varies according to the species) in each of our cells. During development, our cells divide a very large number of times to train adult individuals (made up of more than 30,000 billion cells!).

The equation seems relatively simple, because the DNA sequence of the 46 chromosomes is identically copied (during the ""replication of DNA"") before sharing fairly in two ""girls"" cells during each cell division (called ""mitosis""). Despite this identical genetic information, our cells are not all the same. Each of them differentiates to produce the variety of tissues and organs that constitute our body. It is precisely epigenetic information that allows this differentiation.

""Brand-tags"" in our genome

What do we know about these epigenetic mechanisms that have been the subject of intense research since the beginning of the century? They involve a large number of cellular factors, the function of which is started to understand. Within chromosomes, DNA, negatively loaded, wraps a positively loaded protein, histones. Hundreds of factors bind, directly to DNA or histones, to form what one could qualify as ""epigenetic sheath"".

This sheath is far from homogeneous. It contains factors which can deposit, on the DNA molecule or histones, small molecules which act as ""bookmarks"" that could be put in a book in specific places. These are the famous ""epigenetic marks"" (methylations, acetylations ...) and a large number of them are found at the genes that are located throughout our chromosomes. These marks are essential, they differ in the different cell types composed by an organism and contribute directly to the regulation of the expression of genes (for example, important genes for the function of the liver will be expressed in the liver cells, while the specific genes of neurons or muscle cells will be extinguished). The question is now whether these epigenetic mechanisms also influence the transmission of genetic information.

First, take the simplest case of mitosis (cell division). Most cells must transmit their function, that is, reproduce the expression of the panoply of genes that are their own in their daughter cells. A large upheaval occurs during mitosis with a significant grouping and condensation of chromosomes and therefore of the DNA that compose them. During this stage, DNA remains wrapped around histones, but many proteins in the sheath are dissociated. On the other hand, most brands on DNA and histones are preserved. Thus, epigenetic landmarks will remain on and around DNA. Once mitosis is completed, these brands will allow girls to quickly reconstruct the architecture of genes along the chromosomes, which will still carry the essential epigenetic brands and will again be able to recruit the factors associated with their function. The epigenetic mechanisms therefore participate directly in the inheritance of the cellular function.

Could this epigenetic information also be transmitted to future generations? In this case, the challenge is much more important. The information must be transmitted to the male and female gametes which merge during fertilization to form the first cell of the embryo. This cell will be divided in order to constitute the different cellular types of the future organism. The stages of reorganization and condensation of chromosomes are here even more drastic than during mitosis. The methylation of DNA, the brands of histones and the 3D organization of the chromosomes are largely reprogrammed, as if the body was trying to erase the epigenetic baggage accumulated in the previous generation.

Epigenetic transmissions in certain species

Can epigenetics nevertheless influence the genetic heritage of descendants? Today, this question is the subject of intensive, and sometimes controversial research. This research intends in particular to understand whether environmental, nutritional, stress or exposure to chemical or physical factors could exert influence on future generations.

We have been able to describe precise examples of the effect of the environment on epigenetic regulation in many animal and plant species.

In reptiles, temperature is a major determinant of the sexual type, via the deposit of specific epigenetic brands (methylation of histones). In insects, many phenotypic features are linked to diets that cause epigenetic variations, for example the distinction between the queen and workers 'bees or the distinction of workers' caste in certain ants (via DNA methylation and acetylation of histones, respectively).

Exposure to chemical factors, such as arsenic or bisphenol A can also cause epigenetic changes. We are trying today to understand the mechanisms by which these stimuli act and if they can generate a stable heritage over the generations in the human species. Epidemiological studies have tried to make links between diet and influence on offspring, but these studies often confront multi-factory aspects that are difficult to control and suffer from a lack of molecular evidence.

Studies in terms of model organizations are therefore necessary to study the influence of epigenetic changes on the transmission of genetic information. Examples of transmission of epigenetic states through generations are currently well described in the vercation of C.Elegans and plants, organisms where there is less reprogramming of the epigenetic state during fertilization. Our team is working on the model Drosophila Melanogaster or vinegar fly. Following disturbances of the 3D organization of chromosomes, we were able to highlight cases of inheritance of epigenetic modifications on a gene responsible for the color of the eye over many generations.

In the mouse model, studies have also shown that the insertion of genetic elements made it possible to induce epigenetic changes, in particular DNA methylation. These modifications lead to the repression of a gene responsible for the color of the coat or important genes of the metabolism which, when they are suppressed, cause obesity or hypercholesterolemia, and this, inheritablely on several generations.

In these examples of transgenerational inheritance, the first signal which induces an epigenetic change implies the modification of a small DNA sequence. Even if this sequence is restored to normal, the change is maintained. Although probably rare and possibly influenced by genetic heritage, these phenomena could exist in nature. Future research will be necessary to understand if other epigenetic mechanisms could be inherited.

Although this data does not change current genetic laws, they indicate that beyond the simple duplication and transmission of the DNA sequence to male and female gametes, epigenetic information could contribute to the inheritance of certain traits in many species. This research could therefore be used to better understand the evolution and adaptation of species, as well as mechanisms at the basis of certain human pathologies, such as cancers.",theconversation

Denmark refuses to sell its autonomous territory, whose inhabitants recently brought a coalition in power in which three out of four parties are independentists. Beyond the challenges linked to the natural riches of the immense Arctic Island, what is played out here is also the defense of Greenland, now provided by the United States as part of NATO.

In January 2025, President Trump proclaimed the will of the United States to take control of Greenland and threatens Denmark, whose island is an autonomous territory, of economic or military retaliatory measures if his requirement is not satisfied.

These words shock European, Danish and Greenlandic political leaders. Washington’s openly expansionist posture calls into question the transatlantic link, and with it, security architecture for Greenland. In response, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs and Europe, Jean-Noël Barrot, but also the president of the Military Committee of the European Union, Robert Brieger, suggests at the end of January the sending of European troops to Greenland.

These unanimous convictions are not enough to discourage the new team in place in the White House. In March, the project of visit to Nuuk, the capital, and Sisimiut, the second city of Greenland, of an American delegation led by Vice-President J. D. Vance, without official invitation, was strongly condemned by the Danish and Greenlandic authorities. On March 26, Donald Trump cynically proclaimed in the oval office that the world needs the United States to have Greenland, and that Denmark must yield Greenland to the United States.

Faced with the Danish and Greenlandic protests, the visiting program of the American delegation is revised downwards, but the symbol remains strong: it is at the American space base of Pituffik that J. D. Vance went on March 28.

Washington and the Defense of Greenland

So far, it is above all the United States that ensures the safety of Greenland. But it should not be forgotten that it is at the request of NATO that they manage the Pituffik base (named Thule until 2023), from the 1951 defense agreement signed with Denmark - amended in 2004 to include Greenland as a partner. This agreement does not question the sovereignty in Greenland in the Kingdom of Denmark in question in question, sovereignty that the United States has already recognized in 1916.

It is also NATO members who, with the Northern Viking exercises, strengthen their position in the Giuk area (Greenland, Iceland and United Kingdom), which has become a major strategic concern due to the projection of naval power of Russia.

However in an astounding statement made on March 27 at the Arctic International Forum in Mourmansk, Vladimir Putin seemed to support the American project for annexation of the territory: ""It is,"" he is, ""serious projects on the part of the United States with regard to Greenland. These projects have ancient historical roots. ""He specifies:"" Greenland is a question which concerns two specific countries. It has nothing to do with us. »»

Does the economic rapprochement desired by Moscow and Washington in the context of the negotiations on the war in Ukraine could ramifications in the Arctic? Kirill Dmitriev, adviser to President Putin for foreign investments and economic cooperation, says: ""We are open to cooperation in investment in the Arctic. It could be logistics or other areas beneficial for Russia and the United States. ""But before concluding agreements,"" he adds, the war in Ukraine must end. »»

The growing involvement of Greenland in its safety

Danish Prime Minister puts Frederiksen, wants to believe that the transatlantic link remains solid. However, if the weakening of this link raises questions on the security of Greenland, the march of the autonomous territory towards independence introduces another factor.

Cécile Pelaudeix, provided by the author

Greenland security is inevitably determined by its relationship with the old colonial power. Today, Greenland is independent in several areas of administration, but security and defense in particular remain the responsibility of Denmark. However, the Greenlandic government, the Nalalakkersuisut, would like to be more and more involved in decision -making relating to these areas. Hoping for economic benefits and the valuation of local knowledge, it aspires to gradually take charge of certain aspects of the security policy.

The autonomous territory was consulted for the first time significantly on defense issues during the implementation of the defense agreement concluded on January 27, 2025 between the Government of Denmark and the parties represented in the Danish Parliament, worth 2 billion euros. The agreement intends to improve surveillance, the affirmation of sovereignty and societal resilience in the region, supporting the allies and the NATO mission. The parties also want to strengthen cooperation in intelligence and research and modernize the installations of the joint arctic command in Nuuk. To this end, three new arctic patrol ships are planned.

In this context, the results of the legislative elections held in Greenland on March 11 report a marked desire for strengthened economic development allowing access to independence.

A new government in a critical moment in the history of Greenland

The two parties that have dominated the political life of Greenland for 50 years, the leftist ecological party Inuit Ataqatigiit (AI) and the Social Democratic Party Siumut, saw their support combined falling in half for the benefit of the center of Law Demokraatit (29.9 % of the votes), favorable to a liberal economic policy in Greenland, in particular for the sector of the populist Naleraq (24.5 %). Like all Greenlandic parties with the exception of Atassut (liberal-conservative party having collected 7.5 % in the last legislative elections), Naleraq wishes the independence of Greenland but it claims immediate independence. The large government coalition formed on March 27 brings together the DEMOKRAATIT, Inuit Ataqatigiit, SIUMUT and ATASSUT parties, but it excludes Naleraq, a decision that translates the desire not to weaken the future of Greenland at a time when Washington hammers its desire to get its hands on the island.

During his campaign, the Demokraatit party insisted that Greenland was not for sale, while wishing independence of Greenland supported by a free association with Denmark or with the United States. The free association designates international agreements between small states and a great power which guarantees them significant security, defense and financial assistance, such as the 1986 free association treaty, which governs relations between the United States and the Pacific micro-states such as Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and the Palaos. This option seems to have long been firing while anti-American demonstrations take place in front of the United States Consulate in Nuuk. IA and SIUMUT recommend participation in NATO in addition to Danish national defense, stating that Greenland could sit within the NATO parliamentary assembly.

The majority of Greenland women and politicians are looking for a security partnership that complements that which exists between autonomous territory and Denmark. This desire for a post-colonial arrangement is also clearly reflected in the search for a diversification of economic partners with, for example, Iceland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Asian countries. The European Union does not appear in a protruding way in the proposals of political parties, perhaps because of the agreements already signed under the 1985 Greenland Treaty which associates Greenland and the EU. The EU pays 13.5 million euros each year to Greenland to open its waters to EU fishing ships, and 3 million euros to support sustainable fishing. In addition, there are 225 million euros for the period 2021-2027 to support green education and growth.

With regard to raw materials, the EU and Greenland signed in November 2023 a strategic partnership agreement, in the form of a memorandum of understanding aimed at establishing sustainable value chains for raw materials. Naaja H. Nathanielsen, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Mineral Resources, Justice and Gender Equality of Greenland, said that this agreement would be supported by a roadmap in order to guarantee concrete results enjoying the two parties, but that the EU should encourage Member States to invest.

In terms of defense and security, Greenland options are not so varied. In addition to counting on the United States and Denmark, they consist of two non-exclusive possibilities: NATO and European defense.

Limited scenarios requiring the Greenland agreement

For the Greenlanders who want to be masters of their destiny, any exclusive dependence on the United States is problematic. According to a recent survey, 85 % of them oppose American policy in the matter.

Based exclusively on NATO could also be an uncertain decision. If the United States withdraws from NATO, as Trump has threatened it several times, the legitimization of its management of the Pituffik base would disappear. And if the United States no longer constitutes reliable insurance against the projection of the naval power of Russia and its hybrid threats, but rather threaten Greenland itself as they do insistently, European partners and the capacities of the European Union come into play. States that participated in the Northern Viking exercises-Norway, the United Kingdom and France-would certainly become more important actors Even, possibly, that Iceland, which certainly has no clean armed forces but represents an ""insubmersible aircraft carrier"".

Whatever the options selected, they will only be relevant to the security of Greenland only if they are chosen freely by the Greenlandic people. Between the threat of American expansionism and the post-colonial context, it is perhaps the EU, with its legal structure and its values, which could offer the Groenlanders the best chance of determining their security in their own terms.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,Umbrella and panic: false evidence on the renuclearization and remilitarization of Europe,https://theconversation.com/le-parapluie-et-la-panique-les-fausses-evidences-sur-la-renuclearisation-et-la-remilitarisation-de-leurope-252554,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:34:22 GMT","The cause seems to be understood: the extension to the allies of France of French nuclear deterrence and the massive conventional rearmament of the continent are largely presented, both by the leaders of the country and by most of the media, as almost imperative solutions in the face of the Russian threat and the disengagement of the United States of the defense of the continent. However, the evidence of this necessity collapses as soon as we study the strategic communication campaign that produces it. This is the first step necessary for a serious reflection on a French and European defense strategy.

In recent weeks, the media has largely presented the establishment of a European nuclear deterrence coupled with the conventional EU rearmament (Ursula von der Leyen has announced in this regard a target of expenditure of 800 billion euros over four years) as obviously desirable or even necessary responses to the Russian threat and to American disengagement. This is a strategic communication operation that manifests itself at least three ways, detailed here in order to allow you to recognize them. We therefore leave aside the evaluation of the Russian threat, which deserves an analysis in its own right, to focus on the proposed responses and the production of illusions of obviousness and necessity. As soon as we stop being seduced by these false evidences, a serious strategic reflection on the defense of France and Europe will be able to begin.

Reverse the meaning of words to create illusions of protective and defense

You can hear from articles talking about ""nuclear umbrella"", ""protection"", even ""nuclear shield"". Big news at least sixty-five years: nothing like it exists.

From Monday to Friday + Sunday, receive the analyzes and decrypts from our experts for free for another look at the news. Subscribe today!

The umbrella is able to keep us dry when the rain falls. If the nuclear rain had to fall, there would be no umbrella, any nationality whatsoever. At least since the coupling of ballistic missiles impossible to intercept on thermonuclear explosives in the 1950s and the early 1960s, we remain at the mercy of the technological accident and the determination of the enemy who would like to take the risk of suffering a response. However, the arsenal of Russia is dimensioned from notions such as the limitation of damage (that is to say the destruction of the greatest possible number of enemy weapons before they can be launched against Moscow); If the deterrence was to fail, having nuclear weapons on our soil would transform us into a priority target.

Likewise, offering our umbrella to others does not commit us to commit a violent act for him or her. On the contrary, to offer a ""nuclear umbrella"" is to commit to using nuclear force, with the consequences that we know, if an ally was attacked. Besides the problem that for the ally either there is no umbrella and that the credibility of such a promise is very questionable, it is a question here of committing to committing an act of great violence and being ready to undergo the consequences or to lose its credibility.

Finally, the umbrella makes us strictly independent of the variations in the weather. He shelters us whatever happens. But in the world of ballistic missiles, we remain entirely dependent on the will of the most hostile enemy who would be ready to run the risk of the response and the possibility that remains accidental launch in any country that targets France.

The metaphor of the umbrella describes the desired effects of the proposed policy, not its effects. Those who use it either ignore a known reality for 65 years, or overthrow reality by repeating the elements of language of official discourse and by presenting intentions as proven effects.

Coupled with the qualification of the French nuclear arsenal by the term ""deterrence"" and the assertion of the possibility of ""strategic autonomy"" in a nuclearized world, these three reversals create illusions of protection and defense in a vulnerability. In reality, we remain at the mercy of both the accident and the most hostile enemy.

Do not assess the perverse effects of the proposed political response

The second sign that the voices carrying this discourse make strategic communication is that they do not care about the possible perverse effects of the proposed policy. The only limit mentioned commonly is the problem of credibility, which would require producing more French nuclear weapons and relaunching the creation of fissile materials.

However, any political scientist knows that no policy leads to all of their desired effects and only their desired effects. To make it believe that is precisely to do communication. What are the plausible perverse effects of this policy?

First, historically, since these proposals had the effect of relegitating the French nuclear arsenal and justifying investments in the field, this could help fuel the arms race by creating new targets usable by our opponents to justify the increase in their arsenals.

Then proclaim that a nuclear arsenal is necessary for the security of the continent reaffirms the desirability of nuclear weapons and makes it more difficult to conduct a credible and efficient non-proliferation policy, to which France is attached.

In addition, relaunching the industrial machine to manufacture weapons will increase the carbon footprint of France and the European Union, whose actions are deemed insufficient to keep their commitments in the fight against global warming.

In addition, the rise in water and the climate change that is accelerating will require increased spending to protect each nuclear weapon, and therefore a fortiori each additional nuclear weapon if the arsenal should expand. These weapons will therefore be costs of opportunity in a context of rare resources and increasing needs.

In addition, it would be necessary to identify precisely the actors benefiting from these policies. Let us not forget, in fact, that the investment in the armament had a much lower civilian training effect that announced; that suspicions of corruption have been put forward in the sector; That Thalès, Dassault and Mbda, direct beneficiaries of the announced plan, are still under a complaint of 2022 for complicity in crimes against humanity and war crimes in the context of the war in Yemen, and more recent suspicions relating to the use of the weapons they sold in Israel, which employed them against Palestinian civilians.

Finally, the renuclearization and remilitarization of the European continent, advanced in the name of the fight against the Russian threat, if they were to take place, would only bear fruit in a few years and, therefore, could be directly counterproductive. Indeed, in Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and perhaps in France, pro-Russian parties are probable supporters of power during the next electoral deadlines ... and therefore the beneficiaries of weapons built to undo their political project.

Produce illusions of absence of alternative and virtuous sacrifice of our environmental commitments

Third index revealing the current communication operation: the ambient speech does not explore alternatives, as if the only one was the abandonment of Ukraine. While the rearmament produced and coincides with an abandonment of our environmental commitments, this appears as a virtuous sacrifice in the name of the defense of Ukraine. However, there is no dilemma between respecting our energy sobriety commitments and support for kyiv or the security of the European continent in the face of the Russian threat. We can see it as soon as we stop reducing the possible assistance to Ukraine and security to the supply or possession of weapons.

It is obvious that European Russian hydrocarbon purchases allow the Kremlin to finance the war and its army, so that the reduction of these purchases is, in itself, aid to Ukraine. The margin of improvement in terms of reducing the Russian hydrocarbon bill and helping Ukraine without sacrificing our commitments in the fight against climate change is considerable. It appears as soon as we observe that, as shown in a study by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) in March 2025, since February 2022 the 27 EU Member States bought for more than 205 billion euros in Russian hydrocarbons, more than four times the 49.2 billion euros of military aid provided to Ukraine.

The EU claims that it has emancipated Russian hydrocarbons, but a substantial margin remains. Almost 40 % of hydrocarbons purchased by EU27 countries in India, China and Turkey in the first three quarters of 2024 are of Russian origin. Just over the first four months of 2024, France bought 600 million euros in liquefied natural gas from Russia.

It is wrong to say that the defense of Ukraine demands to sacrifice our climate commitments. On the contrary, progress in the direction of reducing dependence on fossil fuels would benefit Ukraine by reducing our indirect financial contribution to the Russian war effort.

Three conclusions: identify communicators as such, keep our climate commitments and conduct a serious strategic analysis

In conclusion, the media saturation relating to the ""European nuclear umbrella"" coupled with the remilitarization of France and the continent to all the characteristics of a strategic communication operation which falls under intoxication. The diagnosis of this poisoning operation has three opportunities.

First, it makes it possible to distinguish the lobbyists/communicators from analysts. Only the former can make all the errors identified in this article: naturalization of the elements of language of the Official Speech Pro-Armement (nuclear) as categories of analysis (""nuclear umbrella"", ""deterrence"", the possibility of ""protection""), acceptance of affirmations of the desired effects of policies as proof of their proven effects, and lack of consideration of alternative policies or proposed.

These criteria thus make it possible to sort between strategic communication and admissible defense of the proposed policy, which would require not to commit any of these faults. Added to this is the identification of the conflicts of interest of those who express themselves, many of the votes that defend ""European nuclear deterrence"" resulting from institutions with a direct conflict of interest and an explicit role in the promotion of the national nuclear arsenal. The conflict of interest is not necessary for the characterization of communicator/lobbyist, but it constitutes an indicator suggesting a bias.

Then, alternatives, compatible with the holding of our environmental commitments, exist and must be explored.

Finally, climatic, strategic and democratic requirements all call for impartial strategic reflection, which refuses funding conflict of interest, rejects the faults identified above and recognizes the multiplicity of existential threats that we face.",theconversation
https://theconversation.com,"How the ingenuity of ""service plants"" can help reduce pesticides",https://theconversation.com/comment-lingeniosite-des-plantes-de-service-peut-aider-a-reduire-les-pesticides-251171,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:35:15 GMT","In plants there are dozens of mechanisms more ingenious than each other to naturally regulate organisms that attack cultures. Based on these precious allies is essential to reduce our dependence on pesticides. This also makes it possible to build more resilient agroecological systems.

Each gardener knows the Indian carnation, an ally that keeps insects and diseases from the vegetable patch away. But did you know that there are many other plants, called ""service plants"", precious for agriculture more respectful of health and the environment?

Research results reveal that a wide range of plants, when they are integrated into cultivation systems, are capable of regulating field bioagressers (insects and arthropods, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, viruses, weeds), and therefore to reduce pesticide needs.

Depending on the plants, they mobilize a particular mechanism or combine several. Some will act against aerial bioagressors, such as aromatic plants or corn. Others are effective against telluric bioagressors, such as crotalant, hybrid sorghum or crucifers.

Create conducive conditions

Let us initially look at the mechanisms implemented by certain plants to counter air bioagresseurs.

The refuge plants, frequently established on the edge of the plot, provide a housing favorable to the auxiliaries, providing them with the cottage and the cover. Thus, the latter are already present when pests arrive to attack cultures, they intervene faster (predation, parasitism). This is particularly the case with the Mexican sunflower (Tithonia diversifolia) used near sugar cane fields in Tanzania to attract and predict the predatory ladybugs of the yellow sipha flava aphor, a major devastating in this country.

Jacques Avelino, CIRAD, UMR Phim, supplied by the author

Shading plants, integrated into the plot, modify its microclimate. By changing the brightness and humidity, they make climatic conditions unfavorable to certain organisters and more favorable to others.

This is particularly the case for eucalyptus or erythrines in coffee plantations, vis-à-vis the Kahawae Colletotrichum mushroom causing the anthracnosis of the berries in Cameroon. These plants have the same effect on the Placococcus citri cochet and the Cercle Coffeicola mushroom which causes Costa Rica to Cercle.

Create natural barriers

Some plants play a barrier role against attackers. Located on the edge, they form a vegetable curtain which prevents pests from reaching culture. This is the case of the barriers of Crotalaria JUncea which obstruct the passage of the Aleurodes, which fly to the height of man towards the pepper plants.

Other plants also use space to curb the enemy's progress. Associated with a sensitive culture, they will hide the latter from pests by creating a visual ""dilution"" effect. These associations, by generating spatial discontinuity, can also slow the propagation of close to fungal diseases.

They can also regulate weeds by competition for resources (light, water, nutrients) or by physical barrier. In banana groves, species like Neonotonia Wightii or Arachis Pintoi have revealed good skills, with a moderate impact on the growth of banana trees.

Inspired by Ratnadass et al., 2011

Issue repellent or attractive odors

Plants emitting odors can be used alone or combined to increase their effectiveness in a ""push-power"" system:

The ""push"" plant, integrated into the middle of the culture, diffuses a ""repellant perfume"" for pests. Aromatic plants, such as basil or the big West Indian thyme Plectronicus, constitute an interesting pool of ""push"" plants.

CIRAD UPR HORTSYS, supplied by the author

At the same time, a ""sweater"" plant is introduced, either in the plot to attract the auxiliaries, or by the edge to attract the devastating towards it, thus diverting it from culture. Thus, certain varieties of gentle corn attract the female of the tomato night which, instead of laying on tomatoes, will do it on the silks of corn ears - which constitute ""dead ends"" because the larvae that hatch cannot develop there.

Interrupt the reproduction of the enemy

The plants mentioned so far only attacked aerial organic bioagressors. But other mechanisms exist to fight telluric bioagressors.

The rotation of cultures, in particular, makes it possible to interrupt the reproduction of bioagressors. When a plant not sensitive to the aggressor replaces the sensitive plant for a period, the population of parasites in the soil decreases sharply.

Paula Fernandes, CIRAD, UPR HORTSYS, supplied by the author

Once the sensitive culture returns to the plot, it is able to develop without major incidence as long as the pathogenic population remains low. A real speed race then engages between the development of culture and the multiplication of pathogen.

This is for example the case in market gardening or banana groves. Create sanitizing fallows based on non-host species (such as Crotalaria JUncea or Brachiaria SPP) reduce populations of phytoparasite nematodes.

Poisoning or inhibition

Another method of attack on telluries, poisoning or inhibition - also called allelopathy. Here, different strategies exist and have been highlighted.

Certain plants, such as crotalant, release toxic pyrrolizidinic alkaloids via their roots for several species of phytoparasite nematodes.

Another means is bio -feum by certain plants at the time of their decomposition. For example, isothiocyanates, sulfur compounds with a broad spectrum of efficiency (fungi, bacteria, nematodes, etc.), from the degradation of glucosinolates largely present in brassicaceae (mustard for example) and alliays (garlic, onion, etc.).

Other plants, finally, cause the germination of the seeds of parasitic plants (such as striga) or attract pathogens (phytoparasite nematodes) to their roots by emitting signals similar to those of a sensitive plant. Thus, cotton, linen or soy, non -host plants, decrease the infectious potential of the soil by generating the “suicidal” germination of the Striga, whose radicles are then unable to settle in their roots.

In general, service plants can also play a beneficial role by stimulating the diversity of microflora and macrofauna of the soil, in a global or targeted manner.

Delete bioagressors

Among the soil communities are antagonistic or predatory species of the organices. In particular certain free nematodes, which feed on phytoparasite nematodes. But also bacteria and fungi, which can produce antibiotics or even parasitize these bioagresseurs. We then speak of specific suppressiveness.

In banana groves, the fallows of Paspalum notatum thus increase the populations of omnivorous or predators free nematodes, which in return decrease the populations of phytoparasite nematodes.

Other soil microorganisms, without directly regulating pathogens, occupy niches where they are in competition with them, in particular by colonizing the rhizosphere of plants, and using the same resources.

In doing so, they reduce the conditions favorable to the growth of pathogens. We then speak of general suppressiveness.

Enrich the ground

In addition to increasing populations beneficial of the soil, service plants also help to enrich it. Often used as green fertilizers or roofing plants, they restore organic matter to the ground and nutrients, then accessible to the cultivated plant.

Due to improving its physiological resistance, via a more balanced nutrition and the availability of certain trace elements, it is less vulnerable to the attacks on organic, telluric but also air.

The effectiveness of service plants therefore depends to a large extent of the context. To succeed, the use of service plants to manage bioagresseurs requires a clear understanding of the generic principles of agroecology coupled with fine knowledge of the species involved, in order to adapt and apply these principles to specific situations.

The evolution of interactions between cultures and organicians also requires adapting practices to change, and, if necessary, to simultaneously mobilize various measures and mechanisms of regulation.

Youth books, a ""literature under surveillance""",https://theconversation.com/censurer-ou-proteger-les-enfants-les-livres-de-jeunesse-une-litterature-sous-surveillance-252939,"Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:35:34 GMT","The cancellation by the Ministry of National Education of its order for an adaptation of the Beauty and the Beast for CM2 students has sparked a controversy which invites you to look at the particular situation of children's literature and the specific attention which is long granted to public space.

The recent case of the ""Book for the holidays"", as a dismissed Ministry of National Education before its printing in 800,000 copies, surprised a number of players in the book and the school, starting with its author Jul who had adapted the very classic the beautiful and the beast, from Madame Leprince de Beaumont (1711-1776).

The children of CM2 concerned by the operation, which aims to offer them a book to read during the summer before they entered the sixth, will therefore receive another title, but the designer did not hesitate to speak of ""censorship"" on the part of the General Directorate of School Education, which intervened on March 17.

The big word was pronounced and this controversy highlighted the particular situation of children's literature within the cultural field. This is an exception: it owes its audience to be the only place where censorship is exercised openly in a democracy. This necessary protection of the juvenile reader would even impose itself ""naturally"", if we believe the Spanish editor Beatriz de Moura.

But this singular status poses a certain number of questions: how does this ""censorship"" work and from what regulations? On what objects and on which subjects does it exercise?

Children's books, an old control

Since its origins, literature addressed to youth has been a ""literature under surveillance"", because religion, school and political power have always sought to ensure control.

Religious surveillance refers to very old practices (inquisition and index). It is mainly expressed by interventions of ecclesiastics in the field of literature, such as Father Louis Bethlehem who publishes Romans to read and novels to proscribe. Classification test from the moral point of view of the main novels and novelists (1904). In 1927, a resounding trial targets the abbot, who staged in public ""licentious"" journals.

The school also exercises control over children's literature. This institutional pressure is exercised in particular on publishers, aware of the role of the school in terms of prescription. The schooling of children's literature shows one of its setbacks here: the power of influence on sales exercised by the teaching authorities and by the teachers themselves.

Political surveillance of children's literature is not recent. From the end of the 19th century, Senator René Bérenger (nicknamed ""Father the modesty"") created the central protest society against the street license, and the legal arsenal is strengthened with the Outraight Aux Moirs of 1898. Before the Second World War, the law of July 29, 1939 established a family code, of which 20 articles are devoted to the ""offense of manners"".

The political consensus present at the Liberation is therefore not surprising, since law n ° 49-956 of July 16, 1949 on publications intended for youth is the culmination of a half-century process.

In children's literature, from law to self -censorship

The primary function of law n ° 49-956 of July 16, 1949 on publications intended for youth (mentioned today even in all works intended for childhood) is not to exercise censorship, because it first aims to establish ex ante control based on intimidation.

Indeed, its article 3 provides for a supervisory and control commission, depending on the ministries of justice and the interior and responsible for monitoring the entire production addressed to youth, essentially from the criteria defined in article 2. The Commission receives all the titles to be published and makes opinions, sometimes intervening with publishers. According to the formula of researcher Pascal Durand, this law therefore organizes the ""submission of [authors and publishers] on a normative horizon"", which will be described as ""self -censorship"".

Recently, the law has undergone several modifications, notably in its article 2 which defines the disputed questions, but the activity of the commission has ""very strongly reduced"", if we believe Bernard Joubert who identified the victims in his voluminous dictionary of books and newspapers. Censorship is exerted today much more effectively through private actors to which the media field offers favorable terrain, and the institution now seems to be in the background in terms of impact on the actors of the book.

On the journey of a book, actions of censorship and self -censorship can therefore arise at all stages. At the source, the authors spontaneously assume their share, but few openly talk about it, undoubtedly by will not to harm the legitimacy of their creation.

Author Malika Ferdjoukh thus confided that she deleted a sentence which she considered delicate in a youth novel: ""The bee snifles her line of vanilla ice cream. According to her, this free image ""seemed to endorse and make it slightly something that is not."" In Titus Flaminius: La Fontaine aux Vestales (2003), Jean-François Nahmias resorts to very modest words and the narrative ellipse to evoke the first night of love of his character. In this historical novel where the detailed description of the customs of the time sacrificed to the constraint of the genre, the very chaste evocation of the sexuality of the heroes creates an amazing paradox.

The authors therefore assume their share of self -censorship, sometimes at the cost of literary acrobatics, by ""adapting"" their text to their audience, concerned that they are to ""respect their reader"". The publishers intervene secondly, spurred by the legal framework, but especially by the reactions of adult prescribers, who are also their buyers ...

The American influence of ""sensitivity readers""

Some publishers come to spontaneously withdraw from the works under the pressure of effective media campaigns such as the one who targeted on the puberty, (Milan editions, collection ""Les Secrets des pipelettes""), a documentary intended for pre-teens, published in February 2018. Following a petition collecting 148,000 signatories in three days, the publishing house decides to abandon the whole collection. The researcher Mathilde Lévêque gives a critical and nuanced analysis of this case in an article entitled We caught censorship.

Among the prescribers, the librarians have always taken their share in the obstacles drawn between a book and its readers. The intentional absence in the purchasing list, relegation to ""hells"" (when they exist) or simply in the office, are frequent practices. In 2016, in 2016, the Fou du body dictionary (2012), from Katy Couprie, was the subject of a withdrawal measure in the network of the city of Paris.

The state apparatus seems to have lost much of its impact today, the actors of the editorial field ""merchant"" between them - on the media space - the terms of what is now published to youth. The 1949 law remains as a reference in the background, for a publishing sector where pressure groups now occupy first place in terms of interventions followed by effects.

In practice, this situation is more and more like the one that has always prevailed in the United States. The influence of across the Atlantic materializes in the practice of publishers who mobilize ""sensitivity readers"" and warn their readers with ""trigger warnings"".

Finally, it should be noted that censorship is almost exclusively thematic and clearly manifests the evolution of societies, through taboo themes that persist (sexuality, violence, political), but also the emergence of new subjects such as gender or race. Another constant appears: the absence of taking into account the narrative aspects in the presentation of the themes deemed delicate.

The role of literary processes mobilized to represent this or that subject has passed over in silence in the vast majority of cases. However, we know how important this aspect is to assess the possible safety of a story, but the censors rush to the content, without wanting to take into account their treatment or the ""measures to protect the reader"" set up by the authors.",theconversation
