                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new $349 base-model iPad's scores are practically identical to last year's M2-powered Air on single-core processes, and this year's M3 Air only beats it by about 11 percent.

The M3 Air scored more than double the base iPad in the multicore test, which measures a device's ability to do lots of things at once. 

Both Airs more than doubled the iPad in Geekbench's GPU test, which is focused on intensive graphical processing.

The base iPad is still a lovely, fast, usable device for casual use. It's an excellent Netflix machine with an 11-inch screen and four speaker grilles that pump loud sound.

It's great for browsing the web, plenty fast for casual games, and responsive in everyday use.

As soon as you crank up the intensity, the base iPad starts to falter. There are a bunch of games it simply can't play: Assassin's Creed Mirage and Resident Evil 4 don't support the device.

There are others, like Call of Duty: Warzone, where you can feel the lack of graphics power. 

The base iPad lags a bit under the weight of a particularly visual page in productivity-focused tools like Notability.

If you're a multitasker, prone to firing up Stage Manager or just a lot of heavy slide-over usage, you'll notice the difference.

Even if you don't care about the cores right now, I bet you will pretty soon. The base iPad doesn't support Apple Intelligence and has 6GB of RAM when the Air has 8GB.

As more apps update to take advantage of the extra power on the Air and Pro, they might start to feel even slower on the iPad.

The other iPads have much more power than most people need, but that means they have space for you and your needs to grow. The base iPad doesn't.

The other big tradeoff with the base iPad is the accessories. Both the iPad Pro and iPad Air support the latest Apple Pencil and have very good Magic Keyboard accessories, none of which work on the iPad.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unmanned stores can be broadly divided into "self-checkout" types, where customers scan and pay for products without store staff; "walkthrough types", where customers automatically make payments when they pick up the product and leave the store; and "vending machine types", which allow operation around the clock.

The common benefits of unmanned stores are stable store management with no-managers/small people and improved convenience for customers. The core elements of realizing self-checkout/walkthrough stores are the AI ​​camera on the ceiling and the weight sensor on the product shelf. In many cases, the AI ​​camera on the ceiling captures the movement of customers, and the weight sensor on the shelf that it picks up, linking two types of data to recognize "who took what" in real time.

TTG operates an unmanned payment store system, which has steadily increased the number of stores introduced in 2020, starting with the opening of TOUCH TO GO Takanawa Gateway Station Store (Minato-ku, Tokyo). FamilyMart utilizes its unmanned payment store system, and as of September 2024, it has 44 unmanned payment convenience stores nationwide.

Stores that have introduced TTG's unmanned payment store system allow visitors to enter and pay by passing by without needing to prepare to register as a member. The AI ​​camera and weight sensors can recognize who took what, so there is no need to scan the product barcode at checkout.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>今、中国で最も人気のあるIT系企業の経営者といえば、最近再び脚光を浴びている阿里巴巴（アリババ）の馬雲（ジャック・マー）氏でも、同社との二強時代から一強になりトップに躍り出た騰訊（テンセント）の馬化騰（ポニー・マー）氏でもなく、小米科技（シャオミ）の雷軍（レイ・ジュン）氏だ。

シャオミは日本で直営店のオープンや新しいスマートフォンの発売で話題になっている。一方、中国では電気自動車（EV）の魅力的な製品とサービスで注目を集めている。シャオミの創業者であるレイ氏は、モーターショーでインフルエンサーとしてブースに登場し、SNSで動画を配信した。その結果、同氏を見ようと多くの人がシャオミのブースに集まった。

そんなレイ氏は企業の広告塔として、「微信」（WeChat）向けの動くスタンプをリリースし、多くのネットユーザーから人気を集めている。一方で、レイ氏の許可なく、ネットユーザーが多数の音声ソースを使って同氏が口汚く罵る音声をAIツールで作り出し、それをまとめたボイスパックが拡散した。知名度が高いため、あっという間に多くの人がその音声を耳にするようになり、レイ氏は「そういうことはやめてほしい」と動画で訴えかけた。

3月5日に「全国人民代表大会」（全人代）が開幕した。レイ氏も代表の1人として参加し、そこでAIによる個人の顔や声の改ざん対策について3つの提案をした。同氏は特に目立った被害者だが、各種AIツールの登場により、有名人かどうかに関わらず、ニュースで報道されるケースが増えているため、対策を提案したのだろう。

1つ目は、AIに関する独立した法律の導入を検討することだ。適用の境界線を明確にし、権利侵害の証拠に関する規則を変更し、刑事罰を強化する。2つ目は、プラットフォームなどの責任を強化することだ。プラットフォーム企業がAIによって生成、合成されたコンテンツを正確に識別し、検査や審査、苦情や報告、緊急対応のメカニズムを構築し、問題のあるコンテンツの拡散を適時に阻止する技術能力の開発を支援する。3つ目は、ネットユーザーへの啓発を強化することだ。小学校から高校までの教科書にAIに関する倫理的な内容を追加し、家庭でも啓発活動を行う。法整備、プラットフォームの協力、市民への啓発活動の3つの方法は、中国でよく見られるやり方だ。

その後、14日に「人工智能生成合成内容標識方法」が発表され、AIで生成されたファイルにラベルを付けることが義務付けられた。この規則は、情報産業省に当たる工業和信息化部、公安部、国家ラジオテレビ総局などが共同で発表し、9月1日から施行される。この規則では、AIで作られたコンテンツには、誰でも見えるラベルと、見えないラベルを付ける必要がある。プラットフォームは、これらのラベルが付いたコンテンツを適切に扱わなければならない。

サービス提供者は、AIが作ったテキスト、音声、画像、動画、仮想空間などのコンテンツに、AIで生成されたことを示すラベルを付ける必要がある。具体的には、次のようになる。

テキスト：文頭、文末、文中に文字や記号で表示

音声：冒頭、末尾、途中に音声やリズムで通知

画像：目立つ位置にウォーターマークを付与

動画：冒頭、再生中の画面周辺、または途中にラベルを表示

仮想空間：開始画面やサービス提供中にラベルを表示

さらに、ダウンロードやコピーを提供する際にも、これらのラベルがファイルに適切に埋め込まれていることを確認する必要がある。

見えるラベルに加えて、メタデータやデジタル透かしといった見えないラベルも必要だ。AIサービス提供者は、生成されたコンテンツのメタデータにコンテンツの属性や提供者名などの識別情報を埋め込むことが義務付けられる。配信プラットフォームは、メタデータにラベルがあればそれを確認して明示し、ラベルがないものの投稿者が生成コンテンツであると自己申告した場合には、その情報に基づいてラベルを付与する。また、ラベルがないにもかかわらずAI生成の痕跡が認められる場合も、目立つ形で明示的なラベルを追加しなければならない。さらに、ラベルの改ざんや不正操作を目的としたツールやサービスの提供、および他社の権利を侵害する不適切なラベルの使用も禁じられている。

これにより、AIによるコンテンツ生成が引き起こす犯罪が完全になくなるわけではない。例えば、生成AIを使って歴史上の人物を架空の状況で戦わせるなど、歴史を改ざん、悪用する動画を作ることを禁止する「生成式人工智能服務管理暫行方法」によって、中国のネット空間ではそうした動画をほとんど見かけなくなった。ラベル付けが義務化されれば、AIによるコラージュコンテンツはかなり減るだろう。一方で、海外でAIによって作られたコンテンツにはラベルがないため、今後の動向を注視する必要がある。</p>

Just like the original Apple AirTag, it supports "search" and can only be used by iPhone users. It has a thin shape that fits into your wallet, and is useful in the unlikely event that you lose your wallet or find a bag that contains it.

It is not a battery-replaceable type like AirTag, but is basically disposable. The continuous use period is nominally three years, but if the battery runs out, you will need to purchase a new one.

At the Smile Sale, the regular price is 3,990 yen, but 33% off at 2,690 yen. Looking at the Price Tracker, now is the cheapest time.

Other Anker products with sale prices can be listed on the sales page.

Forced restarting is different from normal restarting. To force restart an iPhone 8/X/SE2 or later:

1. Quickly press and release the volume up button.
2. Quickly press and release the volume down button.
3. Press and hold the side button (power button) and release when the Apple logo appears on the screen.

Normal Restart Method

A normal restart is a simple way to just turn it off and turn it on again. First, press either the volume button and the side button at the same time to display the power-off slider, then drag the slider to turn off the power.</p>

Project Mulberry was previously codenamed Project Quartz and has been in development for some time, involving multiple parts of Apple, including Apple Intelligence.

The new version of the Apple Health app will collect data from multiple Apple devices and third-party devices to provide personalized recommendations on improving health.

Apple is training the AI using data from physicians it has on staff and will also incorporate videos from outside doctors and experts on specific health topics.

Other features include food tracking, camera-based workout assessments, and a possible subscription service called Health+.

This new version of the Apple Health app is nearing completion and could ship as soon as one year from now, possibly with iOS 19.4.

In related news, Apple is testing an M5-based iPad Pro internally and plans to ship it later this year.

Apple also plans to release M5-based MacBook Pro and Air models in the future, as well as M6 versions of its modem chips in 2027.

The new iPad Pro with M5 chip will be shipped later this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At last, Star Trek toys have broken away from their weird history and are now delivering figures on a level that fans have been wanting for literal decades.

Revealed at Nacelle’s Star Trek action figure panel with Nicholas Meyer (director of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country) at this weekend’s WonderCon in Anaheim, CA, the wave two figures kick off with Captain Kirk from Star Trek: Generations – This figure was teased at the recent New York Toy Fair, and it’s the only one with accompanying prototype images so far.

 

The rest of the figures include: Captain Janeway from the Star Trek: Voyager episode “Year of Hell”, Nog (Starfleet Uniform) from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, T’Pol from Star Trek: Enterprise, Valeris from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Romulan Commander from Star Trek: The Original Series, Carol Marcus from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Bem from Star Trek: The Animated Series, Worf (Generations Sailor) from Star Trek: Generations, and Geordi La Forge (Generations Sailor) from Star Trek: Generations.

A press release from Nacelle reminds us that its founder and CEO, Brian Volk-Weiss, specifically wanted these releases to be “made by passionate Star Trek fans, for Star Trek fans,” and drew on fan feedback and suggestions when deciding which characters to include.</p>

Charles tends to lead chaos, which fits with Hickman's promise of a huge shakeup for the comics' cosmic side.


The comic "Imperial" will kick off on June 4, and will reveal how the various empires of the galaxy survive whatever Charles puts them through before he returns to Earth.</p>

The current data from the Aladino study and the national plan for the control of the food chain show a worrying situation: The current menus does not correspond to the nutritional criteria recommended by organizations such as the WHO, especially in facilities with students from low-income families. 

The new royal decree will dictate that fruit and vegetables are offered daily. In addition, at least 45 % of these products must be seasonal, and 5 % of the monthly budget for food must be used for biological products.

Regional foods and short production chains are also prioritized. Schools have to incorporate legumes and whole grains more often and ensure that meat and fish recognized nutritional standards correspond.

Schools have to limit pre-cooked dishes such as pizzas or fried food, with only one of these meals allowed per month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A discovery that changes what we believed to know.

For years, global dominance in certain raw materials was in the hands of China, Vietnam and Brazil. Spain seemed completely out of the radar... until now. Data from the Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Change confirm that the country has more than 2,700 active companies that are distributed through its territory. But the really amazing is not the number, but the type of resources they contain.

The focus is on the so-called rare earths: a sentence of chemical elements that are difficult to win, it is expensive to process, but crucial for the production of modern technologies such as microchips, electric motors, wind turbines or advanced batteries. What previously seemed exclusively in other regions of the planet could be closer than we think.

Andalusia leads national metal mining production, with 80% of the total production. In the province of Granada there is the largest Celestinite deposit in Europe, which is essential for the electronics industry. Meanwhile, Castile and León do not remain: their "white gold" and the uranium mine of Retortillo open up opportunities both in mining and in energetic sovereignty.

Kastilien-La Mancha comes into play with a remarkable discovery: Monazit in Campo de Montiel. This mineral contains elements such as CER, Neodym and Lanthan, which are indispensable for high technology products. Extremadura houses one of the most ambitious projects: San José de Valdeflórez, which could generate around 20,000 tons of lithium hydroxide annually, enough for a million electric vehicles.

The available resources are just the first step. Spain has started to sketch a clear way to use it. One of her greatest achievements was the creation of the first European recycling facility for rare earths that ISASMELT F600 furnaces uses to regain valuable materials by melting in melted bathroom.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A scientific prediction that is as distant as worrying.

Although no living person will experience it today, a team of scientists has found that survival on earth is limited. In cooperation with NASA, researchers from the Tōhō University have calculated with advanced models and powerful supercomputers that our planet will be completely uninhabitable in 1000002021 in the year. There will be no trace of life.

This scenario is based on simulations that analyze the evolution of the sun and its influence on the solar system. Over the millennia, the sun will inevitably expand and create so much thermal energy that any form of life on earth will be impossible.

Colonization of other worlds: from theory to necessity

Colonization of other worlds: from theory to necessity. This future raises uncomfortable but necessary questions. Should humanity actually think about leaving the planet? The current missions for Mars and the vision of entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk pursue exactly this goal: to secure a second option for human life.

Musk has spoken out directly: If SpaceX manages to bring people to Mars, it will be his most important legacy. The space colonization, which until recently appeared like science fiction, begins to be seen as an alternative plan for long-term survival.

Sun changes and invisible threats

It is not necessary to wait millions of years to feel the effects of the sun. In May last year, NASA found a number of strong sun eruptions and coronal mass pollution that influenced the earth's atmosphere and caused the most intense sunstorm for twenty years.

These events, although less extreme, are signs of what could happen on a large scale in the future: temperature rise, decrease in the available oxygen and gradually degeneration of the atmosphere. Based on this data, mathematical models come to the conclusion that the earth will become uninhabitable over time.

Is there hope through technology?

Despite the dark scenario that draw the calculations, the experts agree on one point: there is still scope. Technological progress could be crucial to extend life on earth or make survival possible in other places. The expected progress include closed systems for the production of water and air that are essential for survival outside the planet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shawn Michael, a 48-year-old man from the USA, was diagnosed with advanced colon cancer.

This story sparked interest in detail: he had only one symptom before the diagnosis, which was constipation.


The Spanish Cancer Aid (AECC) has repeatedly pointed out changes in bowel movements as possible warning signals in the case of colon cancer. This does not mean that every change implies the presence of a tumor, but it should be examined medically, especially when it continues.

The AECC indicates that these changes can comment on both constipation and diarrhea, even among people who had previously had normal bowel movements.

In addition to changes in bowel movements, there are other signs that could accompany them and that should not be overlooked:

Unusual fatigue for no reason
Inexplicable weight loss
Persistent abdominal pain
Presence of blood or mucus in the chair
Constant feeling of not completely emptying the intestine (Tenesmus)

A visit to the doctor is justified, even if these symptoms do not always indicate a serious illness. If they appear together or exist for a long time, it's essential to consult a specialist.

The message is clear: symptoms that seem slight can be the first indications of more serious problems. In Shawn's case, constipation was the only warning signal before discovering cancer in stage 4.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ministry of Health has ordered an urgent recall of a product called "4 Golden Savoury Rice Steam Bags" from the Iceland brand in the 600-gram presentation.

This product was classified as potentially dangerous for allergic people or people with food intolerance due to the lack of clear information about allergens on the label.

The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (Aesan) pointed out that the identification of the product does not clearly state whether allergens such as milk, fish, crustaceans or molluscs are contained or not.

The product belongs to the category of frozen goods and was on sale in supermarket chains of various regions of the country.

Although the warning was originally communicated in July 2024, the warning is still active because the person concerned has its best before date of November 16, 2025.

According to official information, this frozen rice of the Iceland brand was mainly sold in communities such as Andalusia, Murcia and the Valencian community.

However, it is not excluded that it was also available in other regions of the country, given the brand's national sales.

The main reason for the recall is the lack of clear information about allergens on the label, which violates basic food security regulations.

The Ministry of Health emphasizes how important it is to check the freezer and not to consume this product if it is still in the house.</p>

She developed from the generation of funny images to a useful tool for editing photos, writing texts or automating repetitive tasks. Today it is no longer limited to facilitating our work or daily life: it is also indispensable in the global company structure.

This progress did not come overnight, but could achieve a decisive point in 2025. This is pointed out by Jon Hernández, a Spanish expert for AI who thinks this will be the year in which we will stop considering it as something external.

In his opinion, we will realize that it directly influences our personal, professional and social life. The year in which we will see everything more clearly

The newsletter Algoritmo Diperente, led by Saúl Gordillo, opened the year 2025 with predictions of several experts in the field of artificial intelligence.

Under all the voices, Jon Hernández's special stands out. He claims that this year is not only talking about AI, but we will consciously perceive how it penetrates and changes us. Hernández also predicts a new protagonist in this scenario: the intelligent agents.

These systems will not only react to our inquiries, but will be able to make decisions and carry out complex tasks independently. Autonomous assistants who act on their own initiative, so to speak.

From everyday use to the existential debate

You don't have to imagine a distant future to see how artificial intelligence is already part of almost all areas of life.

Multinational companies such as Microsoft, Apple or Telefónica have integrated them deep into their processes. At the same time, millions of people use them every day to work, clarify questions and even organize travel.

The potential of this technology to accelerate human progress is undeniable, but there are also voices that indicate their dark side.</p>

During the start, landing and a large part of the flight, there are several rules that we all have to follow: pull up the blind by the window, fold in the table on the seat, put on the seat belt when the sign lights up and of course activate the flight mode on the cell phone. 

Rafa San Julián, a pilot at Iberia with more than two decades, explains that this measure is not a mere formality. In the past, certain cell phones could cause disorders in the electronic systems of the aircraft.

"The problem is that you cannot predict how new telephone models react to the aircraft systems," says San Julián. "For reasons why the devices are kept in flight mode for precautionary reasons to prevent them from sending them with maximum performance."

In addition to the cell phone, there are other elements that have their explanation. For example, the blind on the window must always be raised during important maneuvers such as start and landing. 

San Julián clearly summarizes it: "If you have to evacuate, we have to see what happens outside. If it burns, we need to know which side of the aircraft is safer to get out and what emergency outputs can be opened."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bread is a common food in Spanish nutrition, with over 92% of the population consuming it regularly.

According to the Pan Cada Día Association, 75% choose white bread, while others opt for toast with tomatoes or fresh sandwiches.

Endocrinologist Francisco Rosero warns that breaking the fasting period with bread can have negative effects on glucose levels and offer little nutritional value.

During nighttime fasting, the body enters an optimal metabolic state to use fat reserves as energy sources, but consuming a fast carbohydrate source like bread stops this process abruptly.

The increase in insulin production favors fat storage, makes weight loss difficult, and causes problems such as obesity or type 2 diabetes.

Consuming bread on an empty stomach can be particularly harmful to people with existing metabolic disorders.

For those with insulin resistance or increased glucose mirrors, the body has difficulty changing sugar, and consuming bread forces the pancreas to produce more insulin.

This overload can cause a chain reaction of metabolic problems.

The fatty liver is also affected by excess carbohydrates in bread, which are converted into triglycerides and stored in adipose tissue, worsening the disease.

Bread, especially white bread, is poor in fiber and micronutrients.

Although sourdough bread is considered healthier, it contains almost the same carbohydrates and calories as white bread.

Its glycemic index is only slightly lower (60 compared to 70), and it delivers a little more fiber but not enough to alleviate its negative effects when consumed at the wrong time.

The gluten content remains in sourdough bread, which can be problematic for people with sensitivity or intolerance.

There is no solid evidence that sourdough bread is significantly healthier than white bread.

Foods such as eggs, avocados, nuts, or unsweetened natural yogurt offer proteins, healthy fats, and fiber, keeping glucose levels stable and ensuring more satisfaction.

The ideal breakfast does not depend on taste or habits but on how the body reacts after hours of fasting.

Bread is not the best ally to start the day well.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even before its first season was over, Andor was considered one of the best Star Wars projects in a while, and added some variety with its political and spy thriller focus, and by just taking itself seriously. With the show ending soon, creator Tony Gilroy hopes its greatest impact is inspiring the franchise to continue diversifying.

Speaking to GamesRadar, Gilroy teased the second season would “break new ground and open up some canonical things and concepts” in such a way that future creatives “get excited to do other things.” What does he have in mind? To him, Andor could (and should) pave the way for “a [Star Wars] three-camera sitcom, or a horror movie.” He really thinks the franchise needs some spicing up, because he also recalled the first thing he said to Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy when she reached out to him: “I think I said, ‘Could you do a courtroom drama?'”

For a long time, Star Wars has primarily done stories centered on the Jedi, clones, and Mandalorians (or all three). Andor’s first season didn’t have any of that and focused on other unexplored facets of the universe—bureaucracy, the logistics of heists and prison facilities, kicking fascists and hitting them with bricks—and became a critical darling, something its trailers have happily highlighted. Outside Gilroy’s own show, Skeleton Crew is another good example of what he’s talking about, since it’s kid-focused and more of an adventure story. “We’ve made our lane, and we’ve worked really hard to make it. It’s up to other people now to find another way to do it.”

Andor’s final season begins April 22 on Disney+.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA has scrubbed two graphic novels featuring female astronauts from its website, in a move that is in apparent alignment with the Trump administration’s anti-DEI stance.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies are those that generally promote fair treatment of people of all backgrounds. The Trump administration is not a fan of DEI—on the first day of Trump’s second term, the White House called DEI programs “illegal and immoral” and declared that the government is “committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect.” To that end, it seems that NASA removed graphic novels about a fictional female astronaut named Callie Rodriguez from its website.

As reported by Keith Cowing of NASA Watch, the graphic novels had been online for years. (“Apparently NASA DEI Sanitation Squad is using my postings to help them delete things,” Cowing wrote.) The series titles were “First Woman: NASA’s Promise for Humanity” and “First Woman: Expanding Our Universe.”

The space agency left up releases announcing editions of the graphic novels and updates to the series, but the main landing page—dedicated to Rodriguez’s story as the (fictional) first woman to walk on the Moon—now yields a 404 error. NASA’s Press Secretary Bethany Stevens did not respond to a request for comment.

In January, NASA moved to terminate diversity programs, and last month the agency informed its employees that they could no longer display pronouns in their online profiles, from email signatures to their Microsoft Outlook accounts.

This week alone has been a turbulent one for NASA under the Trump administration—several days ago, the agency terminated $420 million in contracts, according to the the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has slashing headcount at the federal government since its creation by executive order on Trump’s first day in office. It remains to be seen how drastically DOGE, under the leadership of Elon Musk, will alter operations at the nation’s space agency.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple devices currently track various health metrics such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and calories burned, but this data is not being used.

 

The company has a plan to make use of this health data with the help of AI through its Health app. This new strategy, reportedly referred to as Project Mulberry or Health+, is underway at Apple, with doctors brought in to train AI agents.

These doctors and other experts are also making videos to explain certain health issues and what can be done to improve them. The goal of this project is to have an AI coach that can look at all the health data collected from the various Apple and third-party devices to give recommendations on how to improve a user's health.


Apple wants its AirPods to have heart-rate monitoring, temperature sensing, and other sensors in order to gather more data on the user. The company has filed paperwork for a patent to have the AirPods keep track of other fitness metrics, such as how steadily a person walks and their breathing patterns.

The plans for the AirPods are still a long way from happening, if they ever do. Apple is currently wrestling with AI, particularly with its rollout of Apple Intelligence.


Apple revealed its big endeavor into AI with Apple Intelligence when it unveiled the iPhone 16 last September. The features Apple showed off have been slowly trickling out, and most notably, the integration of AI into Siri to give the assistant an overhaul has yet to materialize.

The head of the team that developed the Vision Pro VR headset has reportedly been put in charge of the Siri team.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple is working to bring its next-generation M5 chip to the iPad Pro and has begun advanced testing of the next generation device, according to a new report from Mark Gurman . In a newsletter to subscribers, Gurman says the company is positioning the iPad Pro as one of the first products to feature the M5, signalling a significant upgrade for its premium tablet line later this year.The new iPad Pro models, identified by internal code names J817, J818, J820, and J821, are allegedly in the late stages of testing within Apple's labs. Production is slated to begin in the second half of 2025, putting the devices on track for a launch before the year ends. Alongside this, Apple is said to have already kicked off early development of M6-powered iPads, which will integrate in-house modem chips. Those models are being eyed for a 2027 release, marking a longer-term shift toward Apple's own connectivity solutions.Just this month, Apple updated the iPad Air ( $50 off ) and the entry-level iPad ( $20 off ) with new features and performance boosts. The iPad mini, refreshed late last year, didn't join this round of updates. The iPad Pro, last overhauled in May 2024 with a sleeker design and the M4 chip, also skipped this cycle. Gurman notes that Apple sees the iPad Air as a key sales driver, with the category posting double-digit revenue growth over the holiday season. Meanwhile, a simpler "chip-and-ship" refresh for the low-end iPad, focused primarily on a processor upgrade, is already in the works for a future release.Details on the M5 iPad Pro's specific features remain under wraps, but its advanced testing phase suggests Apple is moving swiftly to keep its flagship tablet at the cutting edge.We'll let you know when more details surface on the M5 iPad Pro's release schedule.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>YouTube has turned off ad revenue for two channels, Screen Culture and KH Films.

Deadline reported that YouTube is claiming both channels are violating its monetization policies.

Some of the most famous videos from Screen Culture have been "trailers" for fictional movies like Fantastic Four: First Steps and Superman.

KH Studio has made trailers for a Squid Game season starring Leonardo DiCaprio and a James Bond movie headlined by Henry Cavill and Margot Robbie.

Screen Culture's videos have teased characters that haven't been revealed in Marvel's trailer, such as Julia Garner's Silver Surfer and Ralph Ineson's Galactus.

KH Studio founder said his videos are meant to provide fun 'what if' scenarios and called the demonetization decision "tough to see it grouped under 'misleading content'".

Screen Culture founder Nikhil Chaudhari took a similar stance, saying most YouTube users know its videos are fake, so there's no real harm done.

The videos are being seen as misleading because they could be confused with actual movie trailers by some viewers.

YouTube forbids content made in a way that could mislead viewers or created for the sole purpose of getting views.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Reddit user experienced an unexpected surprise upon booting their PC: 50GB of anime girl pictures in their Windows temp folder, courtesy of XPG's Prime utility.

The software was originally designed to customize and sync RGB lighting across compatible products, but it doesn't delete temporary UI wallpaper images and creates new redundant copies on every restart.

XPG is a gaming hardware brand that specializes in RAM and SSDs, with a strong commitment to its anime styled aesthetics.


I installed XPG Prime on my system, which has a DDR5 memory kit from XPG's Lancer series. There's no standalone installer for XPG Prime, so I had to grab it from the Microsoft Store.

On opening the app, it prompted me to create or use an existing XPG account, though there was an option to proceed as a guest as well.

The "Wallpaper" section of XPG Prime allows users to change their wallpaper from one of seventeen options.


I tried reopening the app several times while monitoring the size of my temp folder. Every time the app started, it generated a roughly 15MB copy of the same wallpapers.

This might vary from user to user, but reaching 50GB at this rate would require over 3,000 attempts.

The app serves a rather limited purpose and could easily be substituted for alternatives like OpenRGB, unless you desire something specific.</p>

The play's preview run began this weekend ahead of its full launch in April, and Netflix provided two new screenshots showing Louis McCartney as Henry Creel using his powers.


 

In addition to the previews, a documentary about First Shadow's production will be released before its West End opening night in December 2023. The West End show received critical acclaim and won two Olivier Awards for set design and entertainment of comedy or play.


 

First Shadow is set in 1959 and follows Henry Creel as he moves to Hawkins with his family. Initially, things seem normal, but strange crimes start happening around the city that may be connected to Henry's powers.

 
The Broadway cast includes Louis McCartney, Alison Jaye, Burke Swanson, and T.R. Knight, and the play will open at the Mariott Marquis Theater on April 22.</p>

The camera features a Raspberry Pi Zero as its main board, powering the operation. To take a photo, press the green button once for a short press. The camera also allows you to adjust the brightness of the image by rotating it.

To print the photo, long press the green button. The camera has a built-in thermal printer that prints on sticker paper.

The housing was created from scratch and digitally 3D printed in PLA. A feature protects the camera module lens when rotated.

The main board is connected to a Raspberry Pi camera module for capturing images. An Em5820 thermal printer is used to print the images, while an LCD screen with a resolution of 240 x 240px lets you preview them first.

The unit also features a rotary encoder and 1200mAh batteries to keep it portable. 

A custom Python script captures images with the picamera2 library and manages printing using python-escpos.

 The print files are available alongside a complete hardware list over at Printables.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sounds oblique? It is somehow. Because who really needs Candy Crush or Beach Buggy Racing on the dashboard?

Gaming in the car? Only when it says.

The new games are part of Android Auto 14.1's beta update. There are classics like Farm Heroes Saga, Candy Crush Soda Saga, Angry Birds 2 and the Cartoon racing game Beach Buggy Racing. The feature was announced for the first time at the Pixel Feature Drop on March 4 - now it ends up in the first vehicles with Android Auto.

One thing is clear: playing is only allowed when the car is stopped. And that's a good thing. Tesla had got trouble in the past because drivers gambled while driving-which the US transport authority didn't find funny at all. In the meantime, Tesla has deactivated the function in driving mode. So Google is on the safe side.

Show the first tests: Not everything runs smoothly yet

The first impressions, such as 9to5google, show: The whole thing works - but not perfectly. In a test video, Beach Buggy Racing was played on a connected Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold. 

Entertainment in the passenger seat

Despite childhood diseases, an official video from Google shows that at least Farm Heroes Saga fits well on the car display in the 16: 9 format.

Of course, all of this is intended for passengers. Because honestly: The touchscreen in the center console is probably the most uncomfortable place to play - regardless of whether you are sitting in front or back. For bored kids in the back seat, which are waiting for their limo in the drive-in, it can be a nice pastime.

The exciting question is: Why does Google do that at all? Access to YouTube in the parked car still makes sense - but games?

Quite simply: Tesla does it. Native games have been played in Teslas since 2019, for example on the large screen in the middle. And Google obviously wants to catch up. Perhaps it is also about more than just a few candy crush moments.

Because in the long term, Google thinks towards autonomous driving. If one day the car really drives itself-for example through Waymo, Google's sister company for robotaxis-the interior becomes an entertainment zone.</p>

The solar radius is 432,690 miles (696,347 kilometers), so the structure described by the team extended as far as 1,298,070 miles (2,089,041 kilometers)—it’s a pretty large structure!

The video was taken by Metis on October 12, 2022. 

Metis’ unique capabilities allow researchers to study the solar wind at its source, shedding light not just on the wind but also on the Sun’s inner corona, which produces the particles.

The current plan is to keep Solar Orbiter operational through 2026, though the mission could be extended until 2030.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Linus Torvalds is upset about the inclusion of "hdrtest" code in the Linux 6.15-rc1 pull request.

He calls it "disgusting 'hdrtest' crap" that slows down software builds and leaves "random 'hdrtest' turds around."

Torvalds writes that he had to resolve trivial conflicts to include the pull request, but noticed the hdrtest code was slowing down the build process.

The code also leaves unwanted files in the include directories, breaking filename completion.

This is not the first time Torvalds has complained about this issue; he wonders why hdr testing is done as part of the regular build.

Torvalds advises developers to run hdr tests separately, rather than including them in the main build process.

He decided to mark hdrtest as broken for now, preventing its inclusion in regular builds.

The "hdrtest" code is related to Intel Xe kernel driver updates and testing DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) header files.

HDR has nothing to do with High Dynamic Range graphics, but rather stands for header file verification.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The signs have long been there: Google shifted its focus by Android as a heart - and towards the dazzling future of artificial intelligence.

According to Android Authority, Google wants to complete Android's development completely internally. In short: the Android source code is privatized.

Of course, this is a win for Google. In the future, the group will no longer have to deal with two different code bases or react to external feedback, while in the background the next Android version is already being worked hard. This also brings advantages for users-because it means: no more android versions during the development phase.

So far, on the one hand, there has been the internal source code that Google passes on to manufacturer with Google Mobile Services Treaty, and on the other hand, the publicly accessible Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which in principle can use everyone.

The fact that Google now completely switches to an internal development structure shows how the priorities have shifted in the company. Artificial intelligence is now the big thing - especially Gemini.

Already at the developer conference Google I/O 2024 it became clear where the wind is blowing: The hardware and software departments were merged into a central "Platforms and Devices" unit.

Just a month later, David Burke, who had significantly shaped Android development for 14 years, came back from his position as an engineering vice president and switched to an advisory role.

Another sign of change. Nevertheless - don't panic: Not much changes for the platform itself.

According to the industry analyst Carolina Milanesi, the step makes sense from the point of view of resource distribution. "The change is logical when you look at where the work really counts," she wrote in a message.

At first glance, little changes for Android users. However, what could change noticeably is the exchange between Google and developers without a GMS contract.

"Developers may have less insight into what comes ... but the actual access remains the same," continues Milanesi.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Contraceptive implants are among the safest methods of contraception, but require a visit to the doctor or clinic.

 
The intervention requires a visit to the doctor or in a clinic - and is not easily accessible to every woman.

 
A team of researchers has developed a new technology that combines the best of two worlds: the long-term effect of an implant and the uncomplicated application of an injection - without any medical staff.

These tiny particles contain the hormone levonorgestrel, which is also used in classic contraceptives. After the injection, the crystals in the body form a depot that slowly releases the active ingredient for months or even years.

"Our goal is to offer women worldwide various and easily applicable contraceptive methods - especially those that also work in regions without stable medical infrastructure," explains Vivian Feig, mechanical engineer at Stanford University and co-author of the study, in a statement of the MIT.

 
The biggest challenge so far: active ingredients with long-term effects usually need large, thick needles - painful and impractical for everyday life. The new system starts here: The combination of fine crystals and a special liquid (benzylbenzoat) makes the injection possible even with significantly smaller needles.

 
"Two things have to be right for a broad application on the market: the needle size and the viscosity of the liquid," says Giovanni Traverso, senior author of the study and gastroenterologist on as well as at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. "We wanted to create the most comfortable solution as possible - so small needles and a thin-fluid solution that can be easily injected by hand."

 
The researchers can specifically adjust the mixing ratio of the solution in order to control the release of active ingredients individually.

This flexibility shows how versatile our system can be used - not only for contraception, but also for other medication with long-term effect," explains Sanghyun Park, doctoral student.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple's M5-equipped iPad Pros are reportedly in the late stages of internal testing.

 

The devices, code-named J817, J820, and J821, will enter mass production in the second half of 2025 and could go on sale in late Q3 or early Q4.

 

The M5 upgrade is likely to be a minor spec bump, as the M4 iPad Pro introduced significant design changes. A previous rumor indicated Apple's next-gen M5 chip entered mass production earlier this year, fabricated by TSMC on its N3P node.

 

This will result in only a 5% boost in performance and a modest 5-10% gain in efficiency. Apple is already testing the M6 iPad Pro with the company's in-house modem, which reportedly will debut in 2027.

 

Alongside the new iPads, Apple will upgrade its MacBook Pro lineup with the M5 chip later this year. The new models should go official in late October, sticking to the company's usual timeline of unveiling new Macs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Asus ROG Crosshair Extreme X870E motherboard is in the works.

 
The previous model had a colorful anime-themed design, but this one features a premium finish with black and silver accents.


A customizable LCD sits atop the I/O shroud, and the motherboard uses dual 8-pin EPS power connectors.


It has four DIMM slots, a DIMM.2 slot for an M.2 expansion card, and a heatsink covering the first M.2 slot beneath the CPU socket with a heat pipe for heat dissipation.


Two PCIe x16 slots are present, likely to support Asus' updated Q-Release Slim GPU removal mechanism.


Additional M.2 slots and the two Promontory 21 chipsets are housed within a large heatsink, adorned with Asus' ROG design.


On the right, you can find Asus' Q-Code LED for POST diagnostics alongside a "START" button and a "FLEXKEY" button.


The FlexKey button is used as a system reset button by default but its functionality can be customized for other use cases.


There are several right-angled ports to the right, including one for the large 24-pin ATX connector.


The back of the motherboard has a protective and stylish backplate with rear I/O options that include USB ports, a BIOS flashback port, an HDMI port, a 5GbE, a 10GbE, and Wi-Fi 7 antenna connections.</p>

The new models, called J817, J818, J820, and J821, are currently in late testing and are on track for production in the second half of 2025. These devices are likely to launch in fall 2025, coming after the May 2024 release of the M4-powered iPad Pro models.

The M5 chip is being made using TSMC’s 3-nanometer process and promises big improvements in performance and energy efficiency compared to earlier versions. It is also expected to enhance AI capabilities and overall functionality, which could be especially useful for Apple’s Vision Pro devices as well as iPads and MacBooks.

Apple has also started early work on M6-powered devices, which are planned to add in-house modem chips by 2027. This step marks Apple’s probable move away from Qualcomm modems, as the company hopes to give users better technology with its own silicon by that time.

The report, written by 24 experts in the field, revealed that current approaches to achieving artificial general intelligence are not sufficient. 

The section on "AI Perception vs. Reality" referenced the Gartner Hype Cycle characterization, which showed that hype for Generative AI had passed its peak and was on the downswing as of November 2024.

79% of respondents stated that public perceptions of AI's capabilities do not match reality, with 90% saying this mismatch is hindering research. 

Artificial general intelligence refers to human-level intelligence in machines, which can interpret information and learn from it like humans do.

A surprising majority (76%) said scaling up current approaches will not yield AGI.

According to the report, AI researchers prioritize safety, ethical governance, benefit-sharing, and gradual innovation over a race towards AGI.

The technology has made significant progress, but hype is distorting its state.</p>

We worked through the process, with her eyeballing vast quantities of food. I mostly observed and took notes, feeling amazed by her ability to do it without measuring anything.


I was particularly impressed by how she mastered salt levels, as too little can lead to unwanted results like mold, while too much overloads the palate. The right amount encourages healthy bacteria to develop complex flavors, killing off what's harmful.


After my first kimchi lesson, I returned a pandemic later to make a smaller batch with Soo Jin Lee, our nanny. She grew up in Jeollabuk-do province and learned to cook from her family and TV.</p>

The Crucial CUDIMM DDR5-6400 C52 memory kit's JEDEC-rated timings are daunting enough to deter potential buyers.

This is understandable since more speedy DDR5-6400 memory kits are on the market with better timings.

Crucial's CUDIMM memory kit specifically appeals to Core Ultra 200S processor owners who are content with baseline performance and wish to avoid messing around inside their motherboards' settings.

Intel's latest 800-series platform is presently the only one that has fully adopted CUDIMMs, so AMD users should steer clear.

While CUDIMMs can function on AMD platforms, their functionality is limited since you lose the CKD's function; thus, spending extra on a feature you can't fully utilize doesn't make much sense for AMD users right now.

DDR5 is more expensive than DDR4 for several reasons, but a primary factor is the need for more components.

The Crucial CUDIMM DDR5-6400 C52 is priced at $169.99, significantly higher than competitors that offer considerably better timings and, consequently, higher performance.

Does the premium price tag make it a poor memory kit? Not really.

Remember that the Crucial CUDIMM DDR5-6400 C52 competes in a niche market.

The memory kit's standing on the AMD platform remained unchanged. The CUDIMMs did not exhibit notable highlights on this particular platform, as they typically ranked at the bottom of the barrel regarding application and gaming benchmarks.

By default, the CUDIMMs operate according to JEDEC's 1.1V for DDR5.

The PMIC accommodates voltages of up to 1.435V, providing significant voltage headroom.

Nevertheless, we could not overclock the CUDIMMs beyond DDR5-6400, even when utilizing the maximum DRAM voltage or implementing very relaxed timings.

It's plausible that our sample didn't have any overclocking headroom or that the motherboards may not be optimized for Micron ICs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 77, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world.

The author introduces themselves as an editor-at-large and Vergecast co-host with over a decade of experience covering consumer tech.

I also have for you a terrific new Apple TV Plus show, a deep dive into fax machines, the internet's favorite new AI plaything, and much more. Kind of a light week this week, honestly, but still lots to dig into. Let's do it.

The Drop

Screen share

Marina Galperina joined The Verge a few weeks ago as a senior tech editor and immediately started asking extremely fun questions.

Marina's been covering tech and science for a while, but I wasn't sure if she was a true gadget-head or not.

So I asked Marina to share her homescreen with us, to see if I could figure it out.

The phone: iPhone 14 Pro. The screen is kind of crushed, but generally, it's a fine device and actually fits in my hand!

The wallpaper: It's a Gothko! Mark Rothko's Untitled (Black on Gray) that I saw at the Guggenheim years ago.

It took me a minute to find the real one online, because before, I used to use AI-generated images.

The author then lists several apps and services that Marina uses.

Cabel Sasser's annual snack roundups were also mentioned as a great resource for discovering new snacks.

 

Here are some user-submitted recommendations:

I wanted to recommend Lunatask, which might be the ultimate platform for life tracking. It works cross-platform, and it is end-to-end encrypted. It has already replaced Todoist for me, but that's not all: it also has a Notes tab, which can be connected to your calendar or tasks.

Watched Khakee: The Bengal Chapter (available on Netflix) this week. Very good.

I started using the iOS Journal app and reflecting on my day every day.

Besides the official games (my favorites are Dragonyhm and Hermano so far), there are a ton of polished games on itch.io and from other publishers.

 

The author ends by introducing their own snack-related content interests.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google unveiled Gemini 2.5, the company’s most advanced AI model to date, with integrated thinking capabilities.

Earlier this week, it was initially exclusive for those willing to pay $20 per month for Gemini Advanced membership.


Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking off The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap.Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today.Try it at no...

The official Gemini App X account wrote in a thread justifying the move: “The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap,”

Advanced subscribers still get the better experience. Not only do they get a “longer context window”, but “free users have rate limits on this model, which do not apply to Advanced users”.

The official documentation does indeed make it clear that power users will want a paid account.

While Gemini’s 2.5 model hasn’t even been available for a week yet, it is already impressing.

It's at the top of the LMArena leaderboard, leapfrogging ChatGPT 4o, and beating its rivals on math, creative writing and science benchmarks.

Impressively, Gemini 2.5 achieved a score of 18.8% on Humanity’s Last Exam — a test designed to push AI’s use of complex knowledge to the limit — putting it ahead of Open AI o3-mini (14%), GPT-4.5 (6.4%), Claude 3.7 Sonnet (8.9%) and DeepSeek R1 (8.6%).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA’s Curiosity Mars rover has detected the largest organic (carbon-containing) molecules ever found on the red planet.

The discovery is one of the most significant findings in the search for evidence of past life on Mars, because relatively complex, long-chain carbon molecules are involved in biology on Earth.

Scientists think that, if life ever emerged on Mars, it was probably microbial in nature.

Because microbes are so small, it’s difficult to be definitive about any potential evidence for life found on Mars.

The organic molecules found by Curiosity consist of carbon atoms linked in long chains, with other elements bonded to them, like hydrogen and oxygen.

They come from a 3.7-billion-year-old rock dubbed Cumberland, encountered by the rover at a presumed dried-up lakebed in Mars’s Gale Crater.

Scientists used the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on the NASA rover to make their discovery.

Among the molecules were decane, which has 10 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms, and dodecane, with 12 carbons and 26 hydrogen atoms. 

These are known as alkanes, which fall under the umbrella of the chemical compounds known as hydrocarbons.

Scientists were actually looking for evidence of amino acids, but this unexpected finding is almost as exciting.

The research is published in Proceedings of the National Academies of Science.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the late 2000s, McKenzie and Stephen Cook devised a problem called the tree evaluation problem.

It involves solving a simpler math problem repeatedly, with outputs of each layer becoming inputs to the next layer until there's just one output remaining.

Different algorithms represent different strategies for calculating this final output from the initial inputs.

Many algorithms can solve the tree evaluation problem quickly, putting it in the class P.

But every such algorithm must devote some memory to the numbers it's working with.

Cook and McKenzie suspected that the problem was impossible to solve using limited memory.

They proved that every ordinary algorithm for solving the tree evaluation problem required too much memory to qualify for membership in L.


Michal Koucký learned about the tree evaluation result from Cook during a 2011 sabbatical in Toronto.

He grew determined to finish what Cook and McKenzie had started, by proving that there's no way to do additional computations using memory that's saving data for later.

Koucký visited colleagues in Amsterdam and posed the question of what can be done with full memory.


The breakthrough came when Harry Buhrman and Michal Koucký showed that even full memory could theoretically aid computation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scholars at Cambridge University Library discovered a 750-year-old text on the legends of King Arthur hiding in plain sight.

The fragment had been repurposed in the binding of a 16th-century property record, making it almost impossible to study without damaging the record's cover.

An interdisciplinary team used advanced imaging techniques to create a virtual copy of the binding and digitally unfold the rare text.

This ground-breaking approach preserved the artifact as an example of 16th-century archival binding practice, which is "a piece of history in its own right," said Irène Fabry-Tehranchi.

In addition to common tools, the team used cutting-edge imaging techniques to photograph every facet of the folded fragment and create a highly detailed 3D model of the artifact.

Hundreds of images were then pieced together like a puzzle to create a digital version of the cover, which researchers can now unfold and study as if they were holding the real thing.

The medieval legends of King Arthur, Queen Guinevere, Sir Lancelot, Merlin, and the Holy Grail have been written in countless versions for centuries.

The fragment found at Cambridge University Library is from the Suite Vulgate du Merlin, a part of the Vulgate Cycle that recounts events after King Arthur's coronation.

One passage tells of the Christian victory over the Saxons at the Battle of Cambénic involving the knight Gauvin (also Gawain) with his Excalibur sword.

Another recounts when a disguised Merlin appears at King Arthur's court during the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.

The translation describes a handsome man arriving at King Arthur's feast, wearing a silk tunic and gold-harnessed harness that glittered in the room.

There are less than 40 surviving copies of the Suite Vulgate du Merlin text known to scholars, each being a unique version copied by hand.

The one found at Cambridge University Library has decorative red and blue initials, suggesting it was written between 1275 and 1315.

Researchers suggest this project not only unlocked one text but also developed a methodology for non-invasive access and study of other manuscripts.</p>

The latest version of Gemini is available at Gemini.Google.com, but it's only accessible via the web for now, with a mobile app release coming soon.

Free users are subject to tighter usage limits, and they may run out of allocated searches after only a few questions.

Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking off, with the team working hard to get it into more people's hands as quickly as possible.

The model is the most advanced version of Gemini to date, with a focus on coding, math, and science capabilities.

As with previous Pro models, Gemini 2.5 Pro will "show" its thoughts and reasoning as it works through user queries.

Google has achieved a new level of performance by combining an enhanced base model with improved post-training in Gemini 2.5.

Gemini 2.5 Pro beats the competition in most areas, particularly in code editing, with a score of 74% on the Aider Polyglot test compared to 64.9% from Claude 3.7.

Google will add pricing for users who want to use Gemini 2.5 Pro at an enterprise level in the coming weeks.

Apple devices are known for their simple and elegant designs, but Rain Design seems to understand the essence of their products.

The Rain Design stands hide behind the supporting devices and do not interfere with your office decor.

The finish also has an "apple-like" colour and texture.

The mStand is my favorite among the Rain Design products, made from aluminum plates, it is sturdy.

Designed with a wide base of 7.5 x 10 inches, it is one of the most stable PC stands I have ever tested.

The slots that can store external keyboards and mice are also very convenient.

If you often work face-to-face while using a PC, choose the mStand360 and you will receive a swivel base.

The iLevel2 can be adjusted to height from 5.4 inches to 7.9 inches using the slider on the front.

mTower is a stand that can store your MacBook vertically, making effective use of your desk space.

This is useful if you are using an external monitor.

And for those who plan to work at their desks but end up sitting on the sofa after lunch, the iLap (with a removable front cushion) is the perfect choice.

The mBar Pro+ is a very good portable stand.

It has a 5.5-inch height and makes it just right for watching videos and typing.

I leave it on my desk on days I don't carry it around, so I can use it right away.

The mBar Pro+ is compatible with most MacBooks, and also supports 9.7-inch iPads, 10.5-inch and 12.5-inch iPad Pros in landscape orientation.

Folding it only costs 9.5 x 6 inches and weighs 205g.

It's compact enough to fit in most tote bags.</p>

In the brief clip, Buterin pats the robot on the head after making the unusual sound. While he has yet to comment on the video, the moment has ignited chatter, particularly given Ether's recent price struggles.

As of publication, Ether has dropped nearly 55% since reclaiming the $4,000 mark in December, now trading at $1,833 — down over 8% in the past week.


Buterin is also not clear-cut in his political affiliation, which is somewhat refreshing for today's polarized crypto traders. He has spoken openly against former SEC chair Gary Gensler as well as the dangers of "large-scale political coins" — seemingly a critique at Trump.</p>

Rocket fell down - the company will try again as fast as possible


The short version The summary is made with artificial intelligence and quality assured by VG's journalists. Today, a rocket was fired from Andøya in Nordland.

This is the first time a rocket of this type is launched from both European and Norwegian soil.

It exploded after just over 30 seconds in the air.


It was unclear for a while whether this was the point or not.

Later, the company Andøya SpacePort, the place where the rocket was launched, set up, crisis after an "incident".

Just after 13.30, the general manager of Andøya Spaceport's parent company confirmed that this is a common procedure after such launches.


The police were out early and reported that there were no injuries.

The company behind the launch itself reports that it has been a great success.


Business Minister Cecilie Myrseth (Ap) calls the operation a "milestone", while the party Red asks for external investigation.


The purpose of firing rockets is, among other things, to obtain information, such as on weather and natural disasters.

The unmanned rocket was in the air just over half a minute before it hit the ground and exploded. Isar Aerospace is the German company behind the launch of the rocket from Andøya Spaceport.


At 13.23, the company writes at X that they refer to the shooting as a great success:


"What a success! At 12:30 CEST, Isar Aerospace fired its launch vessel Spectrum successfully from Andøya Spaceport in Norway.

The launch vessel was interrupted after about 30 seconds in the air, and the vessel fell straight into the sea.

The launch vessel did not go where it was going and the launch was interrupted.


Now the crisis staff has dissolved, according to the company. Work is now underway to identify any environmental and material damage.


On the live broadcast from VG's collaboration newspaper Vesterålen online, you could see the rocket fly up before it lost speed and fell to the ground.


This was the first launch of an orbital carrying rocket type rocket designed to carry payload, such as satellites, into a orbit around the earth. from the European mainland.

- Today was the first integrated test of all systems. The test has resulted in a ton of data from which the team can now evaluate and learn,

- Why is it important to send rockets in the room?

The question is asked to Professor at UiB and the leader of the Romosch group Kjellmar Oksavik, who answers:


There is a huge need in the world to get satellites in the room. For example, to monitor the weather and be able to predict natural disasters.

Oksavik thinks it is an advantage if Europe manages this itself.


"It's almost just great powers like the United States, China, India, Russia who are able to send things in the room," he told VG.


To the newspaper, the professor says that this experience can be used to get a longer flight next time:


Although it exploded, it is a success.

I know they're going to study this carefully and find out what's wrong so they get further next time. That's how you get to the room,

Oksavik said.


Business Minister Cecilie Myrseth (Ap) is also impressed.


- This is a milestone for Norway as a space nation.

I congratulate Isar Aerospace and Andøya Spaceport with a successful test launch, says Myrseth in a press release.


The party Red, on the other hand, is not impressed and has asked for external investigation of the launch.


- How close have we been a big accident or that life could have been lost?

The other thing we need to clarify is the natural consequences,

says parliamentary representative Geir Jørgensen (s) to NRK.</p>

The new hearing aid facility on AirPods is an example of Apple's innovative efforts, along with features like fall detection and non-rhythmic heart activity monitoring.

A new AI agent that acts like a doctor may arrive as early as next year.

Project Mulberry involves a revamped Health app and a health coach powered by a new AI agent that replicates a real doctor to some extent.

The system will be released with the iOS 19.4 update in Spring or Summer next year.

The AI coach will assess data collected in the Health app and offer personalized recommendations based on this data.

Google launched a "Personal AI" within the Fitbit ecosystem last year, offering actionable insights based on lifestyle patterns and workouts.

An upstart named ExerRing introduced a smart ring with an AI coach last year.

Apple's efforts are more expansive, training its AI agent with data from physicians it has on staff, as well as bringing in outside doctors to create videos.

The AI agent will offer guidance tied to food and dietary assistance, among other health-related topics.

It will also provide insights and suggestions in real-time based on users exercising through their phone's camera.

This could tie into Apple's plans for AirPods with an onboard camera and a similar hardware upgrade for the Apple Watch.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After an election campaign built on anti-agiornalism and anti-media rhetoric, the second Trump administration started attacking journalism in various ways.

In just under two months from the settlement, Trump has already threatened to arrest the journalists of the editorial staff of 60 Minutes of CBS (and to revoke the broadcaster of the broadcaster) due to their assembly of an interview with Kamala Harris during the elections.

Excluding the Associated Press from the Oval Studio, the Air Force One and similar environments because it continues to refer to the Gulf of Mexico with its real name; Cut the loans to numerous newspapers all over the world who received economic support from Usaid;

The new administration led by President Donald Trump has also upset the US journalism and media environment. The attacks that followed one another are part of what Reporters Without Borders has called a "monumental assault on freedom of information".

Different journalistic organizations have paid to resolve legal causes intended by Trump, reporting their willingness to limit their freedoms to avoid Trump's wrath.

Instead of choosing to fight these causes, they are consenting to the various Trump attempts to control their coverage, showing them that they are not willing to defend the editorial independence.

Atmosphere that also affects the media coverage reserved for the new president by the US media, especially as regards its relations with the technological oligarchy and Elon Musk and their explicit authoritarian references already emerged.

While some independent journalistic organizations and publishers, such as Wired and 404 media, are explicitly facing the power of Trump and producing a critical coverage based on a journalism based on the facts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The passion towards video games also stems from the fact that thanks to them there can be impossible experiences in real life. Exploring a fantasy world made of magic and dragons, eradicating a terrorist threat by impersonating a great secret agent, traveling in the past and future and much more are all things that anyone who plays video games has tried at least once. In fact, video games allow players to become whatever they want, from heroes without stain and without fear to very powerful warriors capable of sweeping away armies alone. However, having arrived in front of the umpteenth world to be saved or fantasy setting in which to immerse yourself, you feel the need for a change, perhaps trying to identify with something new and never experienced, such as a goat.

Over time, the videogame medium has experienced so much with the classic genres of the world of entertainment that they then come to create such crazy titles that one wonders how it was possible that someone thought of transforming such absurd idea into a video game and that someone has also approved it. Luckily, we dare to add, because these proposals outside the head have turned into so atypical and strange games that they are extremely fun and above all represent a breath of fresh air for those who want an original experience compared to the more classic setting games. Let's go to discover some of the craziest video games that the human mind has ever conceived.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Ninja Turtles at the Rescue comes out in 1990, everything is ready to make it become what it will be: an absolutely incredible success. It could not be otherwise, given the impact that the franchise had had on printed paper, small screen, and every toy shop in previous years.

A universe born from the imagination of two cartoonists a little crazy

To understand how it was possible that Ninja Turtles was able to collect something like 200 million dollars with Si and no $15 million (one of the most surprising hits of that period), it is necessary to embrace a certainty: it was a result connected to its own origin.

The audiovisual, paper market, and the one linked to toys during the 80s had been closely united. Some of the most successful franchises in fact, from the transformers to the Dino-Riders, from He-Man and then move on to the heroes of the DC Comics or Marvel, were protagonists of comics, as well as animated series, and of course toys lines that literally stole.

The revolution of the comic industry had allowed to lower the production and distribution costs in those years, and had found a new generation of authors, designers, new ideas, and characters, who had made a breakdown to say the least predominantly.

Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird published at his own expense in 1984 the first issue of a saga that moved halfway between the tribute and the parody of several three most important characters in Marvel and the DC Comics. Taking advantage of the era of the Direct Market, those who had allowed the proliferation of a tide of independent publishing houses, as a small niche product, the Ninja Turtles became a real generational phenomenon, which changed the history of the independent market.

Ninja Turtles to the rescue was first of all an animated series, which since 1987 brought Leonardo, Donatello, Raffaello, and Michelangelo to become idols for every child and teenager. Breakfast Club after forty years remains an unparalleled film in telling the universe of teenagers The film by John Hughes came out in the room on February 15, 1985 and still remains the absolute totem of the MTV Generation and the 80s.

But cinema at the time was another thing, it was thought that without the adult audience an operation was destined to fail. Walt Disney, Universal, 20th Century Fox, and Warner Bros refused to produce and above all distribute the film, in reality around the Studios and only for some shot in New York, a city symbol of the anthropomorphic turtles quartet and their rodent master.

Ninja Turtles at the Rescue arrived three years after the terrible flop at the Masters of the Universe box office. That film started from an even more important franchise, developed by Mattel, but had been a disaster of criticism and audience. The very popular Transformers had not even gone better, who had sold toys for years.

The animated film of 1986 had been a huge disappointment too. Fortunately, the New Line Cinema thought about it, at that moment a small kingdom especially for independent cinema and the B-Movies, to come to the rescue of the film.

Todd W. Langen and Bobby Herbeck's screenplay resumed the narrative line of the original comics, and only vaguely something of the animated series. The fundamental aspect was to make everything credible with real interpreters, who moved against the background of the Big Apple, in an exquisitely urban environment, where it is still possible to see the best of the references to the youth subculture of those years.

In fact, talking about Ninja Turtles at the Rescue means talking about a film designed for a target, the adolescent one, which if on other occasions had proved disappointing, here instead it was the key to success. And so here we are, 35 years later, to rethink the journalist April O'Neal, to the foot clan that makes New York a jungle after all that is not different I give what Robocop, as well as other films of the time, had described.

In fact, it must be admitted that Steve Barron's film simply represented in a somewhat softer way, the petty crime that had made the 80s in the great American metropolises a real nightmare. To reflect us better then, all elements of the film paid tribute to different genres: martial arts cinema and the youth subculture of the time.

In him there was another element of the film that paid tribute to the martial arts cinema. And then they were there: Leonardo, Raffaello Donatello, and Michelangelo, hungry for pizza, teenagers turtles experts of martial arts, each different in character and style, which have become such after being in contact with a kind of radioactive potion, are still a simply fantastic mix.</p>

The initiative expands the Wayla fleet, the Italian startup that launched, always in Milan, the first Van Pooling service. The project is supported by Next, a cutting-edge company in the design of modular electric vehicles, designed to optimize urban transport.


The modules of Next Srl, currently being tested, are compact but highly adaptable: they can transport up to 22 passengers and hook together to form a convoy equivalent to a traditional bus, up to a 18 meter with 5 modules hooked. They have an autonomy between 300 and 350 km, reach a maximum speed of 110 km/h and recharge completely in less than two hours.


The tests focus on urban performance, safety and reliability to offer an always efficient and widespread service. The production will start at the end of the summer and the first pods will be operational on the streets of Milan at the beginning of next year.

Wayla, is the Italian startup in the urban mobility sector that launched the first Van Pooling service in Milan on 31 October.</p>

Protesters gathered outside Tesla showrooms in Miami and Tampa, calling on people to boycott the company.

A man who identified himself as a Tesla owner said he was there to express his disagreement with Elon Musk's views on Twitter.

The protesters held signs that read "Not My Autopilot" and "Tesla is Trash".

Some protesters were wearing shirts that said "Biden 2024".

A woman holding a sign that read "Gulf of Mexico" said she was protesting because of the environmental impact of Tesla's batteries.

Protesters chanted slogans such as "This is what democracy looks like" and "Hey, hey, ho, ho".

A man holding a sign that read "Tesla Sucks" said he was there to support his friend who lost her job due to the company's policies.

A woman holding a sign that read "Not My Autopilot" said she was concerned about the safety of Tesla's autopilot feature.

Protesters also held signs with messages such as "Elon is a jerk" and "Tesla is a disaster".

The protests were peaceful, with no reports of violence or arrests.


New York City, New York:

Hundreds of protesters marched and chanted in front of a Tesla showroom in the Meatpacking District in New York City.

Protesters waved signs, danced in flaming cardboard Cybertruck costumes, and smashed toy cars on the sidewalk with a hammer.

A moment of silence was held for a large portion of the crowd to lay down on the street with cardboard signs shaped like gravestones to stage a "die in" in front of the Tesla showroom.

Protesters also held signs with messages such as "Strike down Darth Ketamine, Congress must!!!" and "Burn A Tesla Save Democracy".

The protest was peaceful but there were two separate instances where protesters started shouting out for others not to engage with two men holding out microphones and asking questions.


Long Beach and Lakewood, California:

Around 100 people stood on the sidewalk protesting at a Supercharger location in Lakewood.

Tesla owners largely avoided the crowd, going into nearby stores or remaining in their cars.

A man who set up a folding table sold anti-Musk and Trump goods to passersby, but most protesters had brought their own homemade signs and wore shirts with messages such as "Gulf of Mexico" and "Biden Harris".

The protests were peaceful, with some drivers honking and cheering as they drove past the crowd.

A family who decided to engage the protesters yelled that they were "stupid", and a young girl screamed profanities at them.


New York City, New York:


Alice Grimm said this is about bringing down the power of the billionaire. 

From Elon Musk's perspective, any dollar that doesn’t go to him is wasted and efficiency is whatever fills his pocket.

And so Tesla, where most of his wealth is, if what he cares about is that element, then trying to drive down the stock price of Tesla, that attacks Elon’s power.

Gemini 2.5 Pro was originally launched by Google earlier this week as the company's "smartest AI model" to date, with additional sophisticated thinking ability than previous versions.

Access to Gemini 2.5 Pro was initially limited to Gemini Advanced users, who pay a $19.99 monthly subscription fee in the United States.

The new Gemini 2.5 Pro model is already live on the Gemini website, and will be rolling out to the Android and iOS mobile apps in the coming days.

Recent app updates have also improved the user experience by making it easier to select and remember which Gemini model is being used.

Gemini 2.5 Pro supports features such as App/Extensions integration, file uploads, and the Canvas feature.

The model currently leads the LMArena leaderboard and Google noted it is also working to enhance the model's coding capabilities.

Gemini 2.5 Pro possesses a 1 million token context window, enabling it to process large data sets and maintain context over extended interactions.

Plans are in place to potentially extend this to a 2 million token window in the future.</p>

Lucky also separates electronic devices by country, allowing for forensic analysis upon return to Japan to check for signs of tampering.

 

The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has been accused of increasingly strict and unpredictable surveillance, prompting Lucky to take similar precautions even when traveling within the United States.

 

Since the start of the second Trump administration, foreign travelers visiting the United States have been denied entry or detained in increasing numbers.

 

Reports have surfaced of individuals being held for several weeks or denied entry, including some who are legal US residents holding green cards.

 

A French researcher was reportedly denied entry after the US Immigration Bureau found an exchange on their mobile phone expressing personal opinions about Trump administration research policies.

 

German and British authorities have changed travel guidelines due to stricter US visa and travel permit regulations.

 

The UK warns that new rules will be enacted "strictly".

 

The Trump administration plans to impose new "travel bans" on more than 40 countries, with a complete ban on entry from at least 10 countries and increased surveillance for travelers from five more.

 

Travelers from 26 countries will be classified into third categories, with responses to this category decided within 60 days of the policy's implementation.

 

The changes have made the US border increasingly unfriendly for foreigners and Americans returning from abroad.

 

Enforcement measures at the new border are expected to become an aggressive surveillance system that extends to travelers' electronic devices.

 

This poses a threat to digital privacy and freedom of expression for both foreigners and US residents.</p>

The Combo can also automatically put detergent in for you and then open its door when the cycle is done. Samsung has been rolling out the ability to answer your phone from your appliance to its entire Bespoke AI line.

 

At CES this year, Samsung showed off these AI Home control panels on several appliances, including its new Bespoke AI smart fridges and wall ovens. The features work with Android and iOS and require a Samsung account and the SmartThings app.

 

The company's "AI Home" refers to the 7- or 9-inch LCD screens on its products and the screens built into its flagship Family Hub smart fridge. The fridge now has the option of a slimmed-down screen that includes music, weather, and cooking apps, and smart home controls.

 

The flagship Samsung Family Hub smart fridge now comes with the option of a smaller screen. On the fridge screen, users can look up a recipe in the Samsung Food app using ingredients it has identified you have using its AI-powered cameras.

 

Users can then send the cooking instructions to their oven and use the screen to view the recipe. The AI Home screens can connect to Samsung's SmartThings smart home platform.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum price has tumbled below $1,900 in a correction driven by a slew of factors.

According to CoinMarketCap data, technicals for Ethereum's price are grim, with the second-largest cryptocurrency slipping below $1,900. At press time, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,828 and shows no signs of reversing the grim trend. A look at Ethereum's chart does not indicate any signs of an uptrend or a short bounce to stoke embers of optimism.

According to pseudonymous analyst Gum, Ethereum signals "relentless downward price action" that could see the asset fall below $1,800. Over the last day, Ethereum has fallen by nearly 4% while its seven-day chart indicates a decline of nearly 8%. The decline of Ethereum price follows a broader market correction with the global crypto market capitalization losing nearly 3% of its valuation.

On the fundamentals side, things are equally grim for the Ethereum price. Unconfirmed reports of a potential Binance delisting ETH threaten to send Ethereum price to $1,500. Standard Chartered has slashed its ETH prediction for 2025 by 60%, projecting $4,000 as a potential price point by the end of the year.

Ryan Watkins, co-founder at Syncracy Capital, has taken swipes at Ethereum over its failure to keep pace with its peers. Watkins notes that a failure to capitalize on previous momentum during the last two market cycles is haunting Ethereum's price. 

Ethereum has fallen down the pecking order to new blockchains with Solana and Bitcoin tipped to have the upper hand over the network. An inflow of bridged funds from Ethereum to Solana is accentuating the network’s worrying metrics.

Watkins says the only for Ethereum to pull itself from the rut is to "deliver generational leadership and growth." However, with the Pectra upgrade around the corner, enthusiasts are optimistic that Ethereum can reach $10,000.</p>

Last weekend, Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, found himself at the center of a digital fiasco when he was unexpectedly added to a Signal group chat with 17 U.S. government officials who were discussing imminent airstrikes in Yemen. For some, the incident has raised questions about how phone numbers end up in contact lists and how messaging apps pull in users.

National security adviser Mike Waltz on Wednesday stated that Goldberg’s number was “sucked in” from another contact. On a Sunday talk show, Goldberg pushed back, saying, “This isn’t The Matrix. Phone numbers don’t just get sucked into other phones.” Goldberg added, “My phone number was in his phone because my phone number is in his phone.”

Signal’s typically outspoken president Meredith Whittaker has not directly addressed the national security snafu, but earlier in the week, she took to X, writing that, “Right now there are a lot of new eyes on Signal, and not all of them are familiar with secure messaging and its nuances.” She went on to describe and defend the service, calling it the “gold standard for private, secure communications.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google has announced that it is making its advanced AI model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, available for free to all users.

Gemini 2.5 Pro was previously only accessible to Gemini Advanced subscribers who paid $19.99 per month. The new version comes with several improvements, including better reasoning abilities and introduces new features like app and browser extensions, file uploads, and integration with Google's Canvas collaboration tool.

The model is now available on the official Gemini website and will also be available on the Gemini app for Android and iOS soon. Along with this release, Google has updated the Gemini app to improve the user experience. The update makes it easier for users to select and remember which version of the Gemini model they are using.

Gemini 2.5 Pro supports app integrations, file uploads, and works well with the Canvas tool. The model features a context window of 1 million tokens, allowing it to process large amounts of data and maintain consistency in long conversations. Google plans to expand the token limit to 2 million in the future.

Gemini 2.5 Pro is already ranked at the top of the LMArena benchmarks.</p>

Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas recently took to Reddit to address users’ product complaints and reassure them that the company is not under serious financial pressure.

Srinivas seemed to be responding, in part, to a user theory that the company is “doing horribly financially” and “making lots of changes to cut costs.” As an example, the theorizer pointed to Perplexity’s Auto mode, where the AI search engine automatically selects the model with which to answer a user’s prompt.

On the contrary, Srinivas said Perplexity created Auto mode because “all AI products right now are shipping non-stop and adding a ton of buttons and dropdown menus and clutter,” which he said is “not sustainable.”

“The user shouldn’t have to learn so much to use a product,” he said.

As for whether Perplexity is facing pressure to cut costs or IPO, Srinivas said, “We have all the funding we’ve raised, and our revenue is only growing.” In fact, he said the company has “no plans of IPOing before 2028.”</p>

Apple is developing a new version of its Health app that includes an AI coach that can advise users on how to get healthier, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

Gurman first reported that something like this was in the works back in 2023, but now he says development is moving ahead, with the new features potentially coming as soon as spring or summer of 2026, with the release of iOS 19.4.

The AI coach’s advice would be based on data from across users’ medical devices, and would reportedly include food tracking. The coach is currently being trained on data from staff physicians, with Apple looking to bring in additional doctors to record health-related videos.

According to Gurman, this new service is tentatively called Health+.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rush to capitalize on the buzz around AI has led tech companies to dramatically expand their data center footprints.

New and expanded data centers are expected to double the sector's power demand by 2029, according to JLL.

Though solar power suffers from what experts call intermittency — it won't produce if the sun isn't shining — the upsides have been so significant that companies have been inking large deals at a rapid pace.

Since the start of 2025, tech companies and data center operators have backed 12 solar deals, each adding more than 100 megawatts of capacity to the grid.


Meta kicked off the year with a 200-megawatt solar deal with multinational electric utility Engie. The purchase went toward a solar farm near one of the company's existing data centers in Texas.

Later in January, the Stargate AI partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank Group was reported by Bloomberg to be powered, at least in part, by solar.

Meta closed out the month with another massive solar deal, this one with Spanish renewable developer Zelestra. The contract was for 595 megawatts of capacity.


Meta continued its streak in February, investing in a 505-megawatt solar project with Cypress Creek Renewables, which is developing the massive installation in Coleman County, Texas.

Microsoft entered the fray in February, too. The company has long been a buyer of renewable energy to power its operations, and added another 389 megawatts of solar in a deal with EDP Renewables North America.

Amazon also made a big purchase, backing a hybrid project on the Iberian Peninsula that includes wind, solar, and pumped-hydroelectric storage. The deal included 476 megawatts total, of which 212 megawatts are solar.


Outside of the U.S., data center operators have also been investing in solar.

In India, CtrlS built its own 125-megawatt facility in two phases, the first half of which was finished in June 2024 with the second completed in early February.</p>

The Folio Society/Douglas Bell

A big part of my response when I see something like that is to think, “You guys are bad readers, and you’re just fixated on the gadgets, as opposed to the more interesting or radical political or social notions.” But on some level, I also think, “Are they just subscribing to this ur-narrative that a lot of science fiction sells: Won’t it be great when we go to Mars? Won’t it be great to expand outward and colonize forever?”

 

I mean, I’m not the cop. People can tell any kind of story they want. I reserve the right to criticize them and critique them.

 

I should say, by the way, I completely agree with you about bad reading, but I also just think that writers and critics, no matter how brilliant we may be, we don’t own the books. They are always a collaboration. And all books, particularly the most interesting fiction, [are] always going to have contradictory threads.

 

Where I maybe get a little bit hesitant about the idea — I’m not saying you’re saying this, but there can be an implicit literary causality model in this whereby, if we tell the right stories, then we will stop these people making these mistakes. And I just don’t think art works that way.

 

Artists are often very in thrall to a kind of artistic exceptionalism, where they like to justify their work as, on some level, a relatively direct political intervention. Or indeed, sometimes you hear people talk about [art] as activism, and I just don’t think it is.

 

My feeling is: I don’t think there is a story we can tell which someone who — because of the structural position they’re in, as well as maybe their psychology, but those two are not unrelated — I don’t think there’s a story we can tell that they are not going to be able to say, “Yes, what this tells me is, I should make loads of money and be fantastically powerful, whatever it takes.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple is reportedly in the advanced stages of testing its next-generation iPad Pro, which is expected to feature the powerful M5 chip.

The upcoming device could debut as early as Fall 2025, potentially marking it as one of the first products in Apple’s portfolio to be equipped with the M5 series processor. The 2024 iPad Pro marked a significant milestone in Apple’s hardware evolution, introducing the M4 chip ahead of its rollout to Mac devices.

Earlier this year, the M4 series refresh was extended to the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Studio models, establishing a foundation for the next leap in Apple Silicon: the M5 chip. Despite the relatively recent debut of the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips late last year, Apple seems poised to unveil the baseline M5 processor later this year.

The forthcoming iPad Pro has emerged as a prime candidate for showcasing this next-generation silicon. According to Bloomberg, internally code-named models “J817, J818, J820, and J821” have reached late testing stages, with production anticipated in the second half of 2025.

Apple’s next-generation iPad Pro is not expected to feature significant design changes. The M5 chip is anticipated to use a cutting-edge 3nm process, incorporating ARM’s next-generation CPU architecture to deliver enhanced performance and energy efficiency.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The long-anticipated redesign of Apple’s MacBook Pro laptop won’t arrive before 2026, as this year’s models will only get faster M5 chips and nothing else.

New 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are being prepared for a launch later this year. The laptops will run the unreleased Apple M5 Pro and Apple M5 Max chips that will likely be announced alongside the new MacBook Pros.

Nothing else will be changed. In Apple talk, this is called a “chip-and-ship” update. The term refers to a type of device refresh where you mostly put in a faster chip and maybe update the color finish, with no other hardware changes.

The 2025 M5 MacBook Pro is also expected to be a "chip-and-ship" update, similar to this year's models. It will probably happen around the same time of year that it received the M4 processor in 2024 and the M3 in 2023. 

Gurman didn’t say whether the laptop would include an onboard cellular modem or whether there would be versions with and without a built-in modem for 5G cellular connectivity.

Apple usually times significant product redesigns around major technological changes. The iPhone X was the first Apple smartphone featuring a fullscreen design, dedicated facial unlocking hardware and an OLED display panel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aerospace engineers have begun to realize the importance of studying animal flight, particularly in insects, bats, and birds.

But over time, aerospace engineers began to think that there was no need to observe nature. There are millions of flying insects, over 1,400 bats and over 10,000 bird species, but most of them have not been studied.

Wissa noticed that previous research had examined the contribution to the single flap and airflow inspired by rain covering feathers. However, birds do not have a single row of rain cover feathers, but have multiple rows of rain cover feathers that influence each other.

The team first installed a hinged flap at different positions on the top of the wing. A wind tunnel was used to measure aerodynamic forces and airflow velocity around the wing.

Wissa's team then began studying multi-row flaps to see if the aerodynamic benefits could be amplified. It was then found that the addition of flaps enhances certain airflow mechanisms.

The team tested the flap in certain circumstances, including emergency landings on short runways and encountering gusts of wind.

Maintaining control when the wings are at a high angle to the incoming air is important not only to stability, but also to prevent the aircraft from stalling. 

Testing the flaps with wind tunnels and prototypes revealed that lift is increased by up to 45% compared to the absence of the flap, and resistance is reduced by about 31%, helping to prevent sudden lift loss, which causes stall.

These findings could have immense significance for the future of the aviation industry. Climate change makes weather conditions more unpredictable and harsh. Over the past 40 years, the frequency of extreme turbulence has increased by 55%.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple is working on a major update to its Health app, codenamed Project Mulberry.

The new project includes a built-in AI health coach that offers personal health advice similar to what a real doctor might provide.


This AI coach uses data from devices like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods to give tips on how users can improve their health — from sleep and exercise to nutrition and mental wellness.


Apple has been training the AI with help from in-house doctors and plans to bring in outside specialists to create video content that explains different health conditions and lifestyle changes.


The company is building a studio near Oakland, California, where these doctors can film videos for the app.

One major focus will be food tracking, something Apple hasn’t really done before. 

Apple is also looking into ways to use the iPhone’s camera to watch workouts and suggest better form or technique—possibly connecting this with its existing Fitness+ platform.

The project is led by Dr. Sumbul Desai, who runs Apple’s health team, and is backed by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will be adopting its new in-house modems in another product in 2027: that being the M6 iPad Pro.

Apple first introduced its new in-house modems in the recently-released iPhone 16e. It was dubbed C1, and it was certainly a competitive entry into the market. It does lack mmWave though, and Apple is already working on future iterations to bring it up to flagship-levels.

According to Gurman, a future-generation iPad Pro with M6 will be taking the leap to Apple’s in-house modems. This’ll replace the Qualcomm modems currently used on cellular versions of the iPad Pro:

The company has also started early work on M6 versions with in-house modem chips, which are being targeted for 2027.

Despite this M6 iPad Pro being in the rumor cycle already, it actually isn’t the next iPad Pro. Apple is working on an M5 iPad Pro that’ll be as soon as later this year, likely October, according to Gurman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Multiple sources have claimed that iOS 19 will introduce a new design with more translucent buttons, menus, notification banners, and more, and there is now another clue that points towards this glass-like appearance.



Bloomberg's Mark Gurman today said the new design project is codenamed "Solarium" internally. A solarium is a room with glass walls that allow in plenty of sunlight, so this codename further hints at iOS 19 having a "glass-like" appearance with translucent interfaces. The new design is expected to look similar to visionOS for the Apple Vision Pro.

Jon Prosser has shared alleged renders of iOS 19's Camera and Messages apps on his YouTube channel Front Page Tech, and both apps have more translucent designs. However, there is some debate over the extent of the design changes.

Gurman previously claimed that iOS 19 could have the biggest design changes since iOS 7 introduced a much flatter appearance in 2013.

Apple's annual developers conference WWDC returns on Monday, June 9 this year. The first iOS 19 beta should be made available to developers for testing immediately following the opening keynote that day, and the software update should be released to the general public in September. Even the WWDC 2025 logo might hint at iOS 19's new design.</p>
