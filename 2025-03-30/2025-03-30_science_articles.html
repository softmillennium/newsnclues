                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration ordered a broad pause on all US funding for foreign aid in January.

Among other issues, this has significant effects on US funding for HIV.

The United States has been the world’s biggest donor to international HIV assistance, providing 73% of funding in 2023.

A large part of this is the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which oversees programs in low- and middle-income countries to prevent, diagnose and treat the virus.

These programs have been significantly disrupted.


Recent funding cuts for international HIV assistance go beyond the US. Five countries that provide the largest amount of foreign aid for HIV – the US, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Netherlands – have announced cuts of between 8% and 70% to international aid in 2025 and 2026.

Together, this may mean a 24% reduction in international HIV spending, in addition to the US foreign aid pause.


We wanted to know how these cuts might affect HIV infections and deaths in the years to come. In a new study, we found the worst-case scenario could see more than 10 million extra infections than what we’d otherwise anticipate in the next five years, and almost 3 million additional deaths.


HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system.

HIV can be transmitted at birth, during unprotected sex or thorough blood-to-blood contact such as shared needles.

If left untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), a condition in which the immune system is severely damaged, and which can be fatal.


There’s still no cure for HIV, but modern treatments allow the virus to be suppressed with a daily pill. People with HIV who continue treatment can live without symptoms and don’t risk infecting others.

A sustained global effort towards awareness, prevention, testing and treatment has reduced annual new HIV infections by 39% (from 2.1 million in 2010 to 1.3 million in 2023), and annual deaths by 51% (from 1.3 million to 630,000).


Our study

We wanted to estimate the impact of recent funding cuts from the US, UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands on HIV infections and deaths.

To do this, we used our mathematical model for 26 low- and middle-income countries.

The model includes data on international HIV spending as well as data on HIV cases and deaths.


For each country, we first projected the number of new HIV infections and deaths that would occur if HIV spending stayed the same.

Second, we modelled scenarios for anticipated cuts based on a 24% reduction in international HIV funding for each country.

Finally, we modelled scenarios for the possible immediate discontinuation of PEPFAR in addition to other anticipated cuts.


With the 24% cuts and PEPFAR discontinued, we estimated there could be 4.43 million to 10.75 million additional HIV infections between 2025 and 2030, and 770,000 to 2.93 million extra HIV-related deaths.

Most of these would be because of cuts to treatment.

For children, there could be up to an additional 882,400 infections and 119,000 deaths.


In the more optimistic scenario in which PEPFAR continues but 24% is still cut from international HIV funding, we estimated there could be 70,000 to 1.73 million extra new HIV infections and 5,000 to 61,000 additional deaths between 2025 and 2030.

Sub-Saharan Africa will experience by far the greatest effects due to the high proportion of HIV treatment that has relied on international funding.


In other regions, we estimate vulnerable groups such as people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and trans and gender diverse people may experience increases in new HIV infections that are 1.3 to 6 times greater than the general population.

The Asia-Pacific received US$591 million in international funding for HIV in 2023, which is the second highest after sub-Saharan Africa.

So this region would likely experience a substantial rise in HIV as a result of anticipated funding cuts.


More than 10% of new HIV infections among people born in Australia are estimated to have been acquired overseas.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Until recently, scientists thought a rare and potentially deadly meat allergy was transmitted by just one species of tick found in the U.S. — the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum). However, new reports of the allergy, called alpha-gal syndrome, show that the much more widespread black-legged ticks (Ixodes) can also transmit the disease.

Whereas lone star ticks are found mainly in the southern and eastern U.S., black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis), also called deer ticks, are present in the eastern half of the U.S. and the Midwest and the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) inhabits the West Coast.

The new case reports suggest that people in a wide swath of the U.S. are at risk of tick-borne alpha-gal syndrome. However, "evidence continues to support that in the U.S., most alpha-gal syndrome patients develop the allergy after experiencing a bite from a lone star tick," Dr. Johanna Salzer said.

The first case reported in the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases described a Maine woman who developed alpha-gal syndrome after a confirmed black-legged tick (I. scapularis) bite. The 45-year-old woman experienced inflammation and itchiness at the bite site, followed by abdominal pain and malaise nine days later, after eating rabbit.

Over the next two weeks, she continued having digestive problems after consuming red meat. A severe episode of diarrhea and vomiting hours after she ate beef prompted her to visit a health care provider 20 days after the tick bite. Blood tests revealed extremely high levels of alpha-gal-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), confirming alpha-gal syndrome.

The second case of alpha-gal syndrome involved a 61-year-old wildlife biologist in Washington, who experienced a skin rash and lip swelling followed by a severe allergic reaction 29 days later after eating red meat. After being diagnosed with alpha-gal syndrome, she avoided meat and had no further reactions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Brisbane was awarded the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games, it came with a widely publicised landmark promise: the world’s first “climate-positive” games.

The International Olympic Committee had already announced all games would be climate-positive from 2030. It said this meant the games would be required to “go beyond” the previous obligation of reducing carbon emissions directly related to their operations and offsetting or otherwise “compensating” for the rest.

Achieving net-zero was no longer sufficient. Now each organising committee would be legally required to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than the games emit. This is in keeping with the most widely cited definition of climate-positive.

Both Paris 2024 and Los Angeles 2028 made voluntary pledges. But Brisbane 2032 was the first contractually required to be climate-positive. This was enshrined in the original 2021 Olympic Host Contract, an agreement between the IOC, the State of Queensland, Brisbane City Council and the Australian Olympic Committee.

A quiet retreat from climate positive

Research by my team has shown the climate-positive announcement sparked great hope for the future of Brisbane as a regenerative city. We saw Brisbane 2032 as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to radically shift away from the ongoing systemic issues underlying urban development.

This vision to embrace genuinely sustainable city design centred on fostering circular economies and net positive development. It would have aligned urban development with ecological stewardship. Beyond just mitigating environmental harm, the games could have set a new standard for sustainability by becoming a catalyst to actively regenerate the natural environment.

Yet, on December 7 2023, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) initiated an addendum to the host contract. It effectively downgraded the games’ sustainability obligations.

It was signed by Brisbane City Council, the State of Queensland, the Australian Olympic Committee and the IOC between April and May 2024.

Asked about these amendments, the IOC replied it “took the decision to no longer use the term ‘climate-positive’ when referring to its climate commitments”.

The IOC maintains that: “The requirements underpinning this term, however, and our ambition to address the climate crisis, have not changed”. It said the terminology was changed to ensure that communications “are transparent and easily understood; that they focus on the actions implemented to reduce carbon emissions; and that they are aligned with best practice and current regulations, as well as the principle of continual improvement”.

Similarly, a Brisbane 2032 spokesperson told The Conversation the language was changed: “to ensure we are communicating in a transparent and easily understood manner, following advice from the International Olympic Committee and recommendations of the United Nations and European Union Green Claims Directive, made in 2023. Brisbane 2032 will continue to plan, as we always have, to deliver a Games that focus on specific measures to deliver a more sustainable Games.”

But the new wording commits Brisbane 2032 to merely “aiming at removing more carbon from the atmosphere than what the Games project emits”. Crucially, this is no longer binding. The new language makes carbon removal an optional goal rather than a contractual requirement.

Aiming high, yet falling short

Olympic Games have adopted increasingly ambitious sustainability rhetoric. Yet, action in the real world typically falls short.

In our ongoing research with the Politecnico di Torino, Italy, we analysed sustainability commitments since the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. We found they often change over time. Initial promises are either watered down or abandoned altogether due to political, financial, and logistical pressures.

Construction activities for the Winter Olympic Games 2014 in Sochi, Russia, irreversibly damaged the Western Caucasus – a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Rio 2016 failed to clean up Guanabara Bay, despite its original pledge to reduce pollutants by 80%. Rio also caused large-scale deforestation and habitat destruction.

In contrast, other Olympic Games have made significant contributions to sustainability. The Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010, for example, implemented a comprehensive waste management plan that diverted over 90% of waste from landfills.

Victoria Park

Page 90 of the Olympic Host Contract prohibits permanent construction “in statutory nature areas, cultural protected areas and World Heritage sites”.

Local community groups and environmental advocates have vowed to fight plans for a Victoria Park stadium. This may include a legal challenge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In December 2001, a small but lively meeting in Budapest, Hungary, launched a whole new international movement. The resulting Budapest Open Access Initiative opened with the words: “An old tradition and a new technology have converged to make possible an unprecedented public good”.

The initiative was the first definition of open access and referred to harnessing the internet to make scientific research openly available, without a subscription.

More than two decades later, the open access movement has broadened beyond simply research articles. It now incorporates research data, protocols, software and all aspects of the research process. The universal term for this is “open science”.

With its focus on transparency, open science offers part of the solution to the growing problem of scientific misconduct.

Academic institutions and researchers are focused on a very narrow set of metrics for success. These come down to authorship on a publication being the most valued currency in academia because this is the primary measure towards career progression and academic prestige.

Another industry resulting from these metrics is the international university ranking systems. These are run by commercial organisations that publish lists of universities, which in turn promote their institution as being in the “top X%” of whichever list they have done well in.

These systems continue to give institutions incentive to reward their academics for publishing in certain journals for the purpose of raising their rank.

This “publish or perish” push is undermining science.

For example, it has opened up several exploitative industries, such as predatory publishers. These are entities that exploit authors by charging fees for publication without providing adequate editorial services.

Also on the rise are covert entities known as “paper mills”, which manufacture academic articles (either using a human or a machine) and submit them to journals on behalf of paying researchers.

This causes serious issues for editors who need to work through an increasing number of rubbish articles to choose which ones are genuine before sending them out for review by other researchers.

These paper mills create major problems for the scientific record. Some experts believe they are also illegal.

Many of the current problems with research integrity were highlighted by a 2024 study, which estimated that as many as one in seven papers is based on suspect data.

A whole new area of research called forensic scientometrics has developed to try to identify some of these questionable publishing practices.

Science does have a way of correcting itself through retractions, where a problematic paper is withdrawn from the journal and a retraction notice put up instead.

But identifying problem papers is only part of the solution. For example, one 2024 study found less than 5% of all papers identified as retracted were actually removed from journal websites.

Making the data used for the work freely available means the work can be better scrutinised.

This is something that would have helped prevent the publication of the now-retracted study in The Lancet examining whether the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine was effective at treating COVID.

The study was retracted after investigations revealed the data the research was based on was deeply flawed and unable to be verified.

Requiring clinical trials to be registered means drug studies that are unfavourable or show no effect cannot be buried.

Reviewing the “instruction manuals” of how research studies are going to be conducted, called the protocols, before the studies are undertaken also ensures more rigorous research.

That’s because the quality of the protocols determines the robustness of the work.

These are just a few of the ways open science creates an environment where poor research practice is much harder to undertake.

Working openly won’t necessarily stop bad actors. But it will make it much harder for them to operate without being noticed.

A 2022 study on open access policies in Australian universities showed only 50% had an open access policy at the time, even though this is a requirement under the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research.

Despite this, there is some hope for open science in Australia.

For example, in 2024, the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia convened a roundtable event to discuss how to transition to a fair and equitable open research system.

This led to the formation of the National Open Science Taskforce, which is currently co-ordinating open activity in Australia.

Internationally, the European Union was an early advocate for open science, beginning work on the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) in 2016.

Countries worldwide also submitted their first reports last month on their implementation of the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>School principals around Australia are responsible for about 4.5 million staff and students in almost 10,000 schools.

Not only do they oversee students' progress, but they are also responsible for the performance of staff and the wellbeing of everyone at their school.

Their jobs are huge.

As we have previously tracked in our annual survey of principals, their jobs are also extremely stressful and they are subject to regular abuse – often from parents.

Our latest survey shows these trends are not changing.

And more than 50% of those we surveyed are seriously thinking about quitting.

Since 2011, we have surveyed Australian school leaders. This includes principals, deputy principals, and other school leaders such as heads of junior or senior schools.

In our new report, we surveyed almost 2,200 people, which is more than 20% of Australian school leaders.

High workloads and stress

Previous surveys have shown school principals face unsustainably high workloads and high levels of stress. Unfortunately, these trends continue in our latest 2024 results.

School leaders work an average of 54.5 hours a week during term time and 20.6 hours during holidays.

They nominated the "sheer quantity of work" as the biggest source of their stress.

This was closely followed by "lack of time to focus on teaching and learning" and "student-related issues".

Generalised anxiety and depression reports have also increased from last year's survey.

Severe anxiety was reported by 14.8% of participants, up from 11.4% in 2023.

Moderate depression is reported by 11.1% of participants, up from 10.6%.

Critical incidents

For the first time, our 2024 survey asked principals about the number of "critical incidents" they have to deal with.

These are defined as an "often unexpected event that may involve loss or threat to wellbeing or personal goals".

Nearly three-quarters (73.7%) said they had experienced a critical incident while in their role.

The most common type of incident was violence and security threats (43.9%).

Suicide and suicidal threats represented 12.6% of reported incidents.

Participants also reported medical emergencies (10.3%) and custody or child-protection incidents (7%).

Schools are not safe for principals

An increasing number of principals report being subject to offensive behaviours that are unacceptable in any workplace – let alone one that involves children and young people.

Nearly 55% reported they are subjected to threats of violence, 57% are subjected to gossip and slander, and 35% are subjected to cyberbullying.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For young people in the early stages of their career, the idea of waiting 40 years or more to retire might feel like a marathon.

The concept of “micro-retirement” is having a moment. While the term appears to have been first coined in 2007, it’s recently found new popularity on social media.

The notion that rest is crucial – that humans shouldn’t just work themselves into the ground – is very old indeed.

Major religions around the world have long preached the importance of rest and restoration for human beings to survive the hardship of paid work.

Career breaks are a bit different from the ordinary rest opportunities we get such as weekends, public holidays and annual leave. There are a few different types.

The first is the full-time career break, such as a sabbatical. This is where an employee, in consultation with their employer, hits pause for an extended period.

This might be to enjoy travel, develop new hobbies or complete training necessary for career progression. However, the company typically continues to pay a salary (or a percentage of it) during the mutually agreed period.

In Australia, many employees are entitled to paid long service leave after serving between seven and 10 years with the same employer, depending on which state or territory they’re in.

Taking a full-time job part-time can also constitute a kind of career break for some. This is where an employee reduces their working hours or days and earns reduced pay compared to full-time work.

Other types of long-term leave can include parental leave and leave for medical assistance.

In Belgium, a government scheme allows employees to take a career break of up to a year, during which they receive a paid allowance from the government. 

Previous research into the scheme showed 76% of employees taking full-time career breaks from both public and private sectors were aged between 25 and 49.

Micro-retirement might be different.

When Gen Z is talking about micro-retirement, they often aren’t talking about exactly the same thing as a paid, mutually agreed sabbatical.

For many, micro-retirement is a voluntary choice to terminate their employment and support their living through personal savings or government support.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are commonly claims in the media that various actions by the government breach the caretaker conventions.

Before the accusations start flying, here are the basics to help you make your own assessment.

Why do we have caretaker conventions?

There are two reasons for caretaker conventions. First, once parliament is dissolved, the government can no longer be called to account by parliament. It should therefore be more restrained in its actions while not under parliamentary scrutiny.


Second, as a matter of fairness, the government should not be entering into binding commitments immediately before an election, if they will burden an incoming government.

It is unfair for an outgoing government to stack important statutory positions with its own people or enter into contracts that commit a new government to policies it opposes.

When do the caretaker conventions apply?

The caretaker conventions commence from the moment parliament is dissolved. They continue until the election result shows the existing government has been returned to office or a new government is formed.


If there is a hung parliament, it may take a few weeks before we know who will form the new government.

If important matters have to be resolved during that prolonged caretaker period, the opposition may be consulted to try to get a cooperative outcome.

The existing government, however, retains full legal power to act at all times.

How do the caretaker conventions restrict government actions?

Before each federal election, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet issues a document called Guidance on Caretaker Conventions. It sets out the rules for ministers and public servants.


During the caretaker period, a government must avoid:

making major policy decisions that are likely to commit an incoming government


making significant appointments


entering into major contracts or undertakings, such as entry into treaties or other international agreements.

Whether a decision, appointment or policy is major, is a matter of judgement.

In making this assessment, consideration is given to whether it is likely to be controversial or a matter of contention between the government and the opposition.


The cost of the decision and its impact on future resources and policies will also be considered.

Both the government and the opposition can still, of course, make election commitments about future action. The caretaker conventions only apply to actions taken within the caretaker period.


They also do not apply to decisions made and actions taken before the caretaker period commenced, even if they are only announced after it has commenced.

The public service and the caretaker period

Rules have also developed on the fair use of the public service and public resources before and after elections.

Technically, these are not part of the caretaker conventions, which concern self-restraint by ministers.


But because they concern fairness in relation to elections, they are often lumped in with the caretaker conventions and they are included within the official guidance document.


These rules are based upon obligations imposed on public servants by statutes and other instruments, such as the Public Service Act 1999 (Cth), and APS Code of Conduct.

They require public servants to behave in an impartial and apolitical manner. They also require that public resources not be used to advantage political parties during an election campaign.


It is also customary to restrict the use of government advertising during the caretaker period to necessary matters, and those that do not highlight the role of ministers or promote the achievements or policies of the government.

Who enforces the caretaker conventions?

The caretaker conventions are not legally binding and cannot be enforced by a court.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tony Abbott was once unelectable, so were Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. So was Peter Dutton, not so long ago.

But opinion polls over much of 2024 and early 2025 indicated otherwise, and a nightly assault of pre-election political advertising suggested that the Liberals had done their research and needed to humanise their man.

Devotees of Detectives Goren and Eames in Law & Order: Criminal Intent were able to enjoy briefly reviewing Detective Senior Constable Dutton’s time as a Queensland cop, as well as his splendid business career and his more recent meeting and greeting of ordinary Australians as a likeable everyman and all-round good guy.

The ad sometimes played twice in a particular break. Unfortunately for Dutton, we later gained a deeper insight into the very high priority he attaches to rattling the can for the Liberal Party.

Dutton’s decision to attend a fundraiser in Sydney while a cyclone was descending on Queensland did him immense damage, recalling his predecessor’s “I don’t hold a hose, mate” response to the Black Summer bushfires of 2020-21.

When Australians elect their national governments, they can normally assume they are doing so for at least two terms. The last one-termer was the Labor government in 1943.

The Labor government had won 43 seats in the House of Representatives and was able to form a minority government with the support of several independent members.

Labor spirits have revived in recent weeks after Dutton’s missteps over Cyclone Alfred, a comfortable victory in the Western Australian election, and opinion polling that shows the ALP ahead on a two-party preferred count.

Albanese often campaigned poorly last time: will he again falter? Dutton, meanwhile, is untested as leader in an election campaign, has little policy on the table, and has a habit of going missing when there are hard questions to be answered.

For me, the key to this election is whether there is a sufficient number of voters, concentrated in the right places, who share enough of Dutton’s pessimism about their own circumstances and, to a lesser extent, about the general state of the country.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Auckland mayor Wayne Brown said the Auckland Art Gallery had the foot traffic of a corner dairy, casting it as an "uneconomic" entity.

The mayor's comments highlighted a challenge: how can New Zealand cultural organisations secure their future when art and culture are seen through an economic lens?

Our research proposes a concept we call “generative coexistence”. We suggest that when market approaches are integrated thoughtfully, market forces and cultural missions can work together and enable each other.

For years, cultural organisations were shielded from the market by state funding. However, there was no consistent funding strategy.

The 2024 budget included significant reductions in arts funding. Cultural organisations were expected to find new ways to stay viable.

In 2023, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra launched a digital platform, NZSO+, to stream performances and artistic talks.

The orchestra also performed to a flock of farm chickens, to support ethical farming and modernise its brand image.

The moves raised questions about whether the orchestra's essence could be nurtured outside of concert halls. 

They showed a possibility for cultural organisations to blend their authentic mission with commercial acumen without compromising their intrinsic values.

Our research includes examples of cultural groups from around the world. It captures how, rather than seeing commercialisation as a “necessary evil” undermining the arts, cultural groups can use the tensions that come from competing demands to produce creative solutions.

Generative coexistence allows cultural organisations to adapt in ways that not only keep the lights on but also broaden their impact.

We identified three main strategies for organisations in the arts and culture sector designed to help them thrive in a world where financial and cultural goals can seem at odds with each other.

First, organisations need to embrace the commercial potential of cultural products.

Wellington's Te Papa Museum creates value through blockbuster ticketed exhibitions that attract a wider audience. 

By using selective commodification processes, Te Papa maintains its educational and cultural status and generates revenue needed to innovate and expand its reach.

Cultural organisations also need to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset.

Organisations worldwide experiment with innovating existing business models to allow for creative and operational freedom.

Galleries and art spaces are opting for nomadic models, eschewing permanent locations but maintaining a strong online presence. 

This enables cultural actors to adapt and lower reliance on funding while creating cultural value.

Finally, cultural organisations need to look into cross-disciplinary collaborations that align on shared goals.

Finding a balance between financial stability and cultural integrity requires recognising opportunities to work together.

The New Zealand arts sector is still cautious about non-intuitive collaborations with adjacent fields. 

However, partnering with the tech industry holds the promise of new levels of visitor engagement while staying rooted in community enrichment.

Cultural organisations have to navigate a complex landscape where financial pressures and cultural missions intersect and create tensions.

Our concept of generative coexistence encourages a more flexible view.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hycean worlds, a hypothetical kind of exoplanet, could provide the best chance for the James Webb Space Telescope to detect biosignatures.

Those potential signs of life are a group of chemicals called methyl halides, which on Earth are produced by some bacteria and ocean algae.

"Unlike an Earth-like planet, where atmospheric noise and telescope limitations make it difficult to detect biosignatures, hycean planets offer a much clearer signal," said Eddie Schwieterman.

For now, the existence of hycean planets remains hypothetical. Their name is a portmanteau of "hydrogen" and "ocean," first coined in 2021 by planetary scientist Nikku Madhusudhan.


Hycean planets are expected to orbit red dwarf stars, and the best candidate for a hycean world is the planet K2-18b.

This exoplanet orbits in the habitable zone of a red dwarf star 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Leo, the Lion.

The Hubble Space Telescope discovered water vapor in K2-18b's atmosphere in 2019.

JWST has detected the presence of carbon dioxide and methane in the planet's atmosphere, along with a lack of carbon monoxide and ammonia — exactly as predicted by the hycean planet hypothesis.


There's also tentative evidence that a compound called dimethyl sulfide, which on Earth is only produced by ocean plankton, exists in K2-18b's atmosphere.

A team of researchers at the University of California, Riverside and ETH Zurich in Switzerland have gone a step further.

They propose that another family of compounds called methyl halides, generated by microbial ocean life on Earth, could produce a biosignature — that is, a chemical signature of biological life — in the atmosphere of a hycean world.


"Methyl halides on hycean worlds offer a unique opportunity for detection with existing technology," said Michaela Leung.

Methyl halides are molecules that incorporate carbon atoms and three hydrogen atoms attached to a halogen atom such as bromine, chlorine or fluorine.

On Earth, methyl halides are produced by life, but they are far from abundant in our planet's atmosphere.


Leung's team suspect that the conditions on hycean worlds would allow methyl halides to accumulate in large quantities in the atmosphere.

Furthermore, methyl halides would have strong absorption features in infrared light, at the same wavelengths that the JWST is designed to observe.

"One of the great benefits of looking for methyl halides is, you could potentially find them in as few as 13 hours with James Webb," said Leung.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Epigenetic marks are DNA chemical changes that allow certain genes to be activated or extinguished, and they are reproduced when cells divide.

DNA is the founding molecule of earthly life, but it cannot work alone; its information must be interpreted by proteins present in the nucleus of cells, adding additional information called epigenetic information ("epis" from the Greek prefix which means "above").

At each generation, we inherit the DNA contained in the chromosomes of our two parents, with 23 chromosomes from the mother and 23 from the father, leading to 46 chromosomes in each human cell.

During development, cells divide a large number of times to form adult individuals, made up of more than 30,000 billion cells.

The equation seems simple: DNA sequence is identically copied before sharing fairly in two "daughter" cells during each cell division (mitosis).

Despite identical genetic information, our cells are not all the same; each one differentiates to produce the variety of tissues and organs that constitute our body, thanks to epigenetic information.

Epigenetic mechanisms involve a large number of cellular factors, and their function is starting to be understood.

Within chromosomes, DNA, negatively loaded, wraps a positively loaded protein, histones, with hundreds of factors binding directly to DNA or histones to form an "epigenetic sheath".

This sheath is far from homogeneous, containing factors that deposit small molecules on the DNA molecule or histones as "bookmarks" for specific places.

These are the famous "epigenetic marks" (methylations, acetylations...), and a large number of them are found at genes located throughout our chromosomes.

Epigenetic marks are essential, differing in different cell types composed by an organism and contributing directly to gene expression regulation.

Now, the question is whether epigenetic mechanisms also influence the transmission of genetic information from one generation to another.

During mitosis (cell division), most cells must transmit their function by reproducing the expression of all genes that are theirs in their daughter cells.

A large upheaval occurs during mitosis with a significant grouping and condensation of chromosomes, but DNA remains wrapped around histones, and many proteins in the sheath dissociate.

Most epigenetic marks are maintained, allowing gene expression to be controlled even after cell division.

Studies have shown that exposure to chemical factors like arsenic or bisphenol A can cause epigenetic changes, which may lead to stable heritability over generations.

Epidemiological studies have tried to link diet and influence on offspring, but they often confront multi-factorial aspects difficult to control and lack molecular evidence.

Studies in model organisms are necessary to study the influence of epigenetic changes on genetic information transmission.

Examples of transmission of epigenetic states through generations are well described in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. Elegans) and plants, which have less reprogramming of the epigenetic state during fertilization.

Our team is working with Drosophila Melanogaster (vinegar fly), where disturbances of 3D organization of chromosomes led to inheritance of epigenetic modifications on a gene responsible for eye color over many generations.

In mice, studies showed that insertion of genetic elements induced epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation, leading to the repression of genes responsible for coat color or metabolism.

These modifications lead to obesity and hypercholesterolemia in several generations.

In these examples of transgenerational inheritance, a small DNA sequence modification implies epigenetic change maintenance even after restoration to normal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cancellation by the Ministry of National Education of its order for an adaptation of Beauty and the Beast for CM2 students has sparked a controversy.

The recent case of the "Book for the holidays", as a dismissed Ministry of National Education before its printing in 800,000 copies, surprised a number of players in the book and the school, starting with its author Jul who had adapted the very classic the beautiful and the beast, from Madame Leprince de Beaumont (1711-1776).

Since its origins, literature addressed to youth has been a "literature under surveillance", because religion, school and political power have always sought to ensure control.

Religious surveillance refers to very old practices (inquisition and index). It is mainly expressed by interventions of ecclesiastics in the field of literature, such as Father Louis Bethlehem who publishes Romans to read and novels to proscribe.

The school also exercises control over children's literature. This institutional pressure is exercised in particular on publishers, aware of the role of the school in terms of prescription.

Political surveillance of children's literature is not recent. From the end of the 19th century, Senator René Bérenger (nicknamed "Father the modesty") created the central protest society against the street license, and the legal arsenal is strengthened with the Outraight Aux Moirs of 1898.

The primary function of law n ° 49-956 of July 16, 1949 on children's literature is to ensure that content does not corrupt youth. The law remains as a reference in the background, for a publishing sector where pressure groups now occupy first place in terms of interventions followed by effects.

Among the prescribers, the librarians have always taken their share in the obstacles drawn between a book and its readers. The intentional absence in the purchasing list, relegation to "hells" (when they exist) or simply in the office, are frequent practices.

The state apparatus seems to have lost much of its impact today, the actors of the editorial field "merchant" between them - on the media space - the terms of what is now published to youth.

In practice, this situation is more and more like the one that has always prevailed in the United States. The influence of across the Atlantic materializes in the practice of publishers who mobilize "sensitivity readers" and warn their readers with "trigger warnings".

The role of literary processes mobilized to represent this or that subject has passed over in silence in the vast majority of cases.

Censors rush to the content, without wanting to take into account their treatment or the "measures to protect the reader" set up by the authors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In plants there are dozens of mechanisms more ingenious than each other to naturally regulate organisms that attack cultures. Based on these precious allies is essential to reduce our dependence on pesticides. This also makes it possible to build more resilient agroecological systems.

Each gardener knows the Indian carnation, an ally that keeps insects and diseases from the vegetable patch away. But did you know that there are many other plants, called "service plants", precious for agriculture more respectful of health and the environment?

Research results reveal that a wide range of plants, when they are integrated into cultivation systems, are capable of regulating field bioagressers (insects and arthropods, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, viruses, weeds), and therefore to reduce pesticide needs.

Depending on the plants, they mobilize a particular mechanism or combine several. Some will act against aerial bioagressors, such as insects and fungal spores, while others will target soil-dwelling organisms like nematodes.

Different strategies exist for regulating telluric organisms, including poisoning or inhibition - also called allelopathy. Certain plants release toxic compounds via their roots to kill phytoparasite nematodes.

Some service plants can stimulate the diversity of microflora and macrofauna of the soil in a global or targeted manner. This beneficial role of service plants can increase populations of beneficial organisms, including free nematodes that feed on phytoparasite nematodes.

In banana groves, fallows of Paspalum notatum have been shown to increase the populations of omnivorous or predators free nematodes, which in turn decrease the populations of phytoparasite nematodes.

Other soil microorganisms occupy niches where they are in competition with pathogens, reducing the conditions favorable to their growth. We then speak of general suppressiveness.

In addition to increasing beneficial organisms of the soil, service plants also help to enrich it. Often used as green fertilizers or roofing plants, they restore organic matter to the ground and nutrients, then accessible to the cultivated plant.

The effectiveness of service plants therefore depends to a large extent on the context. To succeed, the use of service plants to manage bioagresseurs requires a clear understanding of the generic principles of agroecology coupled with fine knowledge of the species involved, in order to adapt and apply these principles to specific situations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In conclusion, the media saturation relating to the "European nuclear umbrella" coupled with the remilitarization of France and the continent has all the characteristics of a strategic communication operation.

The lobby/communicators make it possible to distinguish from analysts by making errors such as naturalizing the elements of language of the Official Speech Pro-Armement, accepting affirmations of the desired effects of policies as proof of their proven effects, and lacking consideration of alternative policies or proposed.

These criteria thus make it possible to sort between strategic communication and admissible defense of the proposed policy, which would require not to commit any of these faults. Added to this is the identification of the conflicts of interest of those who express themselves, many of the votes that defend "European nuclear deterrence" resulting from institutions with a direct conflict of interest.

The rearmament produced and coincides with an abandonment of our environmental commitments, which appears as a virtuous sacrifice in the name of the defense of Ukraine. However, there is no dilemma between respecting our energy sobriety commitments and support for kyiv or the security of the European continent in the face of the Russian threat.

The EU claims that it has emancipated Russian hydrocarbons, but a substantial margin remains. Almost 40 % of hydrocarbons purchased by EU27 countries in India, China and Turkey in the first three quarters of 2024 are of Russian origin.

It is wrong to say that the defense of Ukraine demands to sacrifice our climate commitments. On the contrary, progress in the direction of reducing dependence on fossil fuels would benefit Ukraine by reducing our indirect financial contribution to the Russian war effort.

The diagnosis of this poisoning operation has three opportunities: distinguishing lobbyists/communicators from analysts, keeping our climate commitments, and conducting a serious strategic analysis.

It is necessary to identify communicators as such, keep our climate commitments, and conduct a serious strategic analysis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US is hammering away at Greenland, wanting to get its hands on the island.

The Demokraatit party insisted during their campaign that Greenland was not for sale, while wishing independence of Greenland supported by a free association with Denmark or with the United States. The free association designates international agreements between small states and a great power which guarantees them significant security, defense and financial assistance, such as the 1986 free association treaty.

The Demokraatit party formed a government coalition with Inuit Ataqatigiit (AI), Siumut, and Atassut parties on March 27. The coalition excludes Naleraq, which claims immediate independence for Greenland. During his campaign, the Demokraatit party insisted that Greenland was not for sale.

Naleraq wishes the independence of Greenland but it claims immediate independence. Like all Greenlandic parties with the exception of Atassut (liberal-conservative party having collected 7.5 % in the last legislative elections), Naleraq wishes the independence of Greenland but it claims immediate independence.

The majority of Greenland women and politicians are looking for a security partnership that complements that which exists between autonomous territory and Denmark. This desire for a post-colonial arrangement is also clearly reflected in the search for a diversification of economic partners with, for example, Iceland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Asian countries.

The European Union does not appear in a protruding way in the proposals of political parties, perhaps because of the agreements already signed under the 1985 Greenland Treaty which associates Greenland and the EU. The EU pays 13.5 million euros each year to Greenland to open its waters to EU fishing ships, and 3 million euros to support sustainable fishing.

In addition, there are 225 million euros for the period 2021-2027 to support green education and growth. With regard to raw materials, the EU and Greenland signed in November 2023 a strategic partnership agreement, in the form of a memorandum of understanding aimed at establishing sustainable value chains for raw materials.

Naaja H. Nathanielsen, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Mineral Resources, Justice and Gender Equality of Greenland, said that this agreement would be supported by a roadmap in order to guarantee concrete results enjoying the two parties, but that the EU should encourage Member States to invest.

In terms of defense and security, Greenland options are not so varied. In addition to counting on the United States and Denmark, they consist of two non-exclusive possibilities: NATO and European defense.

For the Greenlanders who want to be masters of their destiny, any exclusive dependence on the United States is problematic. According to a recent survey, 85 % of them oppose American policy in the matter.

Based exclusively on NATO could also be an uncertain decision. If the United States withdraws from NATO, as Trump has threatened it several times, the legitimization of its management of the Pituffik base would disappear.

And if the United States no longer constitutes reliable insurance against the projection of the naval power of Russia and its hybrid threats, but rather threaten Greenland itself as they do insistently, European partners and the capacities of the European Union come into play. 

States that participated in the Northern Viking exercises-Norway, the United Kingdom and France-would certainly become more important actors Even, possibly, that Iceland, which certainly has no clean armed forces but represents an "insubmersible aircraft carrier".

Whatever the options selected, they will only be relevant to the security of Greenland only if they are chosen freely by the Greenlandic people.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration suggests not reimbursing its creditors, which includes China.

After the war of customs duties, welcome to the war of sovereign debts. Trump's administration suggests not reimbursing its creditors, of which China is a part. Are we witnessing the end of the supremacy of the dollar?

A recent proposal now evokes a selective defect on American debt. According to the Financial Times quoting Bloomberg, Trump suggested that "The Elon Musk team responsible for improving government efficiency would have found irregularities when examining data from the US Treasury Department, which could lead the United States to ignore certain payments."

The term "ignoring certain payments" is an understatement. Clearly, this means considering a selective defect, in other words not to reimburse all their creditors ... individuals as well as state.

Not reimbursing your creditors allows you to voluntarily choose to pay some but no others. Trump evokes this as a means of geopolitical pressure or as a source of income for the state. The defect reduces national debt. But it’s a risky idea. She threatens confidence in the dollar. Who wants to buy state bonds that could be worth 0, depending on the mood of the sovereign?

Tax foreign investors

The economist Barry Eichengreen recently questioned the supremacy of the dollar on the first page of Financial Times, an event in itself. According to Eichengreen, Stephen Miran's proposal - Trump’s main economic adviser - taxing foreign holders of federal treasure titles would risk compromising international financial stability.

The goal is to devalue the dollar to make American exports more competitive. Officially, the administration plans a "commission of use" levied on interest paid to foreign investors. It would be necessary to pay to use the dollar, owned by the United States.

The Trump government plays on words by reversing the "Commission of Use" tax. This direct debit on interest makes it possible to avoid international tax treaties. In practice, it is only foreign investors who pay. Disguised discrimination.

As Brad Setser has recently shown it on the social network Threads, more than half of American debt holders-holders of United States Treasury bonds-are individuals or American companies ... who are likely to be spared by this defect. So who else has this debt? Two governments are at the top of the list: Japan and China.

China: 4 % of American bonds

Japan is still an allied country for the time being and could be exempt. Even if the Trump administration shows less enthusiasm towards Europe and its historic partners, the geopolitical alliance with the United States could still play a role.

China, on the other hand, still holds around 4 % of American obligations in circulation. If this figure may seem low, it represents a considerable sum. More importantly, China has money at stake, with more than $ 700 billion placed in its official exchange reserves, probably higher, taking into account unofficial reserves. Chinese semi-public institutions, such as banks and large companies, potentially hold even higher amounts.

Brad Setser recently indicated on threads that China gradually reduces its assets to American treasury bills. We do not know the exact amounts sold, but the transactions passing through Euroclear, in Belgium, offer an overview. Since 2014, China is actually seems to gradually disengage from the US dollar. It has gone from a creditor with 18 % of American shares to a little more than 4 % today.

China remains the second foreign holder of American bonds. Imagine now that Doge's geniuses or others close to Trump decide, for reasons of domestic policy, a selective defect in China.

Premises with Ukraine

Geopolitics could play in two directions. China would reduce its exhibition before ideologues close to Trump took the initiative. Alternatively, she would pursue her own geopolitical objectives by preventing this risk preventively in the event of future tensions.

Russia also liquidated all of its American treasury bills after the Ukrainian crisis.

The obligations of the American treasury represent, by definition, the safest asset available, according to macroeconomics.

If this active person who was to fail, capital would immediately seek refuge elsewhere without necessarily finding it. For example, there are not enough German treasury bills, and those from other countries are more risky. This corresponds precisely to the definition of a global financial crisis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft is one of the largest and most successful companies in the world, founded 50 years ago by Bill Gates.

 

Microsoft was initially focused on developing software for personal computers, but its strategy has undergone significant changes over the years.

The company's first success came with MS-DOS, which allowed users to interact with their computers using a command-line interface. The operating system became an industry standard and helped establish Microsoft as a major player in the burgeoning PC market.

 

In the 1990s, Microsoft expanded its product line to include graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as Windows, which allowed users to interact with their computers using visual icons and menus.

The company's GUI, designed by Apple but copied by Microsoft, became a huge success and helped establish Windows as the dominant PC operating system.

 

However, Microsoft's success also led to significant criticism and controversy. The company was accused of monopolistic practices and was eventually sued by the US government for violating antitrust laws.

In addition, Microsoft's attempts to diversify into new areas such as video games, online encyclopedias, and mobile phones were largely unsuccessful and resulted in significant financial losses.

 

One of the biggest failures was Microsoft's attempt to compete with Apple's iPhone by launching Windows Phone, a line of smartphones that failed to gain traction with consumers.

The company also launched an online encyclopedia called Encarta, which was quickly overwhelmed by Wikipedia and eventually discontinued.

 

Despite these setbacks, Microsoft continued to evolve and adapt to changing market conditions. In 2014, Satya Nadella replaced Steve Ballmer as CEO and shifted the company's focus towards cloud computing and online services.

Nadella oversaw a significant transformation of the company, including the development of Azure, a cloud-based infrastructure platform that has become one of Microsoft's most successful products.

 

Microsoft also acquired several companies, including LinkedIn for $26.2 billion and GitHub for $7.5 billion, to expand its offerings in areas such as social media and online development platforms.

In 2023, the company began investing heavily in Openai, the company behind Chatgpt, which has given Microsoft a significant presence in the emerging field of artificial intelligence.

 

Microsoft's strategy has undergone significant changes over the years, from its early focus on personal computers to its current emphasis on cloud computing and online services. Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks along the way, the company remains one of the largest and most successful companies in the world.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of scientists has developed a recipe for black holes that eliminates one of the most troubling aspects of physics: the central singularity, the point at which all our theories, laws and models shatter.

If you were going to design an object to preserve mystery while being utterly troubling, you would create something like a black hole. Black holes are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.

Apart from curved space-time, what else dwells at the heart of black holes, if this theory is correct? According to Hennigar, strictly speaking, nothing.

An illustration shows a black hole causing a "plunging" warp in space-time. In the final stages of collapse, both gravity and quantum effects will be important.

Our work provides answers to some mysteries, but it opens others, said Molina-Niñirola. For instance, according to our model — and other proposals in scientific literature — the matter that falls inside a regular black hole would ultimately exit the black hole through a white hole located in a different universe or in a disconnected region of the same universe.

The researcher added that this process entails problems of its own, which must also be investigated to assess the robustness of the team's idea. 

The observation of ripples in space-time called gravitational waves allows astronomers to observe much stronger gravitational fields than ever before. This gives scientists a unique chance at trying to spot effects beyond general relativity.

In this regard, the detection of a primordial, gravitational wave background — which has not been detected yet — could provide hints on possible modifications of gravity.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A U.S. robotics company has used artificial intelligence (AI) to give its humanoid robots a more natural-looking stride.

In the promotional video, the robot, called Figure 02, marches with a "human-like" gait. This is an ability it claims will help its robot to navigate the physical world more easily.

"These initial results are exciting, but we believe they only hint at the full potential of our technology," company representatives wrote in a blog post accompanying its announcement.

The problem, known as Moravec's Paradox, emerges because computers excel at problems that require complex calculations and large datasets, but lack our real-world experience honed by millions of years of evolution. This makes robots' shuffling gaits, well, robotic at best. At worst, it gives them the appearance that they may have soiled themselves.

To tackle the robot's unnatural gait, Figure's engineers used a learning technique called reinforcement learning — placing thousands of virtual robots inside a physics simulator that recreates various terrains, thereby improving their walking through trial and error.

Figure has already tested its humanoid robots in a BMW factory in 2024 and plans to introduce more this year.</p>

A national Newspoll, conducted March 27–29 from a sample of 1,249, gave Labor a 51–49 lead, a two-point gain for Labor since the previous Newspoll, three weeks ago. This is Labor’s first Newspoll lead since July 2024.

Primary votes were 37% Coalition (down two), 33% Labor (up one), 12% Greens (steady), 6% One Nation (down one) and 12% for all Others (up two). By 2022 election preference flows, Labor would have led by about 51.5–48.5.

Anthony Albanese’s net approval improved three points to -9, with 52% dissatisfied and 43% satisfied. Peter Dutton’s net approval slid four points to -18. Albanese led Dutton as better PM by 49–38 (47–38 previously).

This is Albanese’s best net approval in Newspoll since September 2024, Dutton’s worst since October 2023 and Albanese’s biggest better PM lead since May 2024.

The budget itself was not well received, with a net of 34% saying it had made their lives worse. 

A national Redbridge poll, conducted March 13–24 from a sample of 2,039, gave Labor a 51–49 lead, unchanged from the previous Redbridge poll in early March. Primary votes were 38% Coalition (up one), 34% Labor (up two), 11% Greens (down one) and 17% for all Others (down two).

By 54–29, voters were unable to identify something the Labor government had done since its election in May 2022 that had made their lives better. Of those who could identify something, 36% selected electricity rebates, with 11% for the next most popular.

A national Redbridge poll also showed by 35–23, voters opposed the government placing tariffs on goods imported into Australia. By 68–24, voters were concerned about Chinese naval ships sailing down Australia’s east coast and conducting live fire drills.

The Poll Bludger reported that JWS polled the Victorian teal-held seats of Kooyong and Goldstein “a fortnight ago” from samples of 800 each for Australian Energy Producers. In Kooyong, teal Monique Ryan led the Liberals by 51–49, while in Goldstein the Liberals led teal Zoe Daniel by 54–46.

The Kooyong poll agrees well with the YouGov MRP, but the YouGov MRP had Daniel leading by 54.5–45.5 in Goldstein.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is a nearby dwarf galaxy located 200,000 light-years away in the constellations Tucana and Hydrus.

 
The SMC contains just several hundred million stars, compared with the Milky Way's 100 billion stars, and can be seen only from the Southern Hemisphere as a cloudy patch in the night sky.

Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 used its four filters and the observatory's 8-foot (2.4 meters) mirror to capture various wavelengths of light to create this colorful view of clouds of gas and dust illuminated by the light of young stars in the SMC.

The image shows the center of NGC 346, an open star cluster where new stars are born, which contains about 2,500 infant stars that have formed from gravitationally collapsing gas clouds.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Peter Dutton is a tease when it comes to the fine print of policies.

Critics have a harsher take on why we’re always being told to wait for the detail. They would claim his policies are often thin, or unfolded on the run.

Right now, we’re into the first week of the campaign, with polls published on Sunday turning in Labor’s direction, and we’re still waiting for more on the Coalition’s gas reservation policy, announced in Dutton’s budget reply.

Dutton said on Sunday we’d get information on the gas policy in the next “couple of days”.

Danny Price, of Frontier Economics, has been hard at work, putting some modelling together. Price did the modelling for the opposition’s controversial nuclear policy, finding it much cheaper than the government’s energy transition plan.

The modelling was contested, and no doubt so will be the gas policy analysis. Whatever the numbers that come out, they won’t include one key figure: what you would (arguably) save on your power bill.

Albanese dismissed Labor’s modelling before the 2022 election as “RepuTex modelling based on the circumstances at the time”.

Dutton has, however, suggested his gas policy would reduce the wholesale domestic price from $14 per gigajoule to under $10 a gigajoule. More gas would mean cheaper prices, is its logic.

The opposition’s thinking is that it lands the generality of a policy first, lets the public absorb that, and then produces detail.

But the trouble with releasing the detail so late is the Coalition is likely to get bogged down in a confusing and damaging debate over what opponents will say are dodgy numbers and assumptions.

This can lose a day or more and there aren’t that many days in a five-week campaign, especially when pre-polling starts a fortnight before the end.

While Dutton was batting off questions about gas at the weekend, Anthony Albanese swung into his campaign stride in a comfort zone – at attack on supermarkets.

He announced that if re-elected, Labor will legislate against supermarkets being able to price gouge. Not immediately though. There’d be a taskforce to work out the detail.

A long inquiry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission into supermarkets found they were very profitable but it didn’t find price gouging.

Its raft of recommendations did not include legislation on price gouging. This hasn’t deterred the PM, who provided his own definition of the problem.

“Price gouging is when supermarkets are taking the piss off Australian consumers. That’s what it is. That’s what price gouging is.”

He also gave the rather less colloquial EU definition: “In the EU, a price is unfair and excessive if, and to quote their law, ‘it has no reasonable relation to the economic value of the product supplied’.”</p>
