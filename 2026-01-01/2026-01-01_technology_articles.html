                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI is betting big on audio AI, and it's not just about making ChatGPT sound better. According to new reporting from The Information, the company has unified several engineering, product, and research teams over the past two months to overhaul its audio models, all in preparation for an audio-first personal device expected to launch in about a year. The move reflects where the entire tech industry is headed — toward a future where screens become background noise and audio takes center stage. Meta just rolled out a feature for its Ray-Ban smart glasses that uses a five-microphone array to help you hear conversations in noisy rooms — essentially turning your face into a directional listening device. Google, meanwhile, began experimenting in June with “Audio Overviews” that transform search results into conversational summaries. And Tesla is integrating Grok and other LLMs into its vehicles to create conversational voice assistants that can handle everything from navigation to climate control through natural dialogue. It's not just the tech giants placing this bet. The makers of the Humane AI Pin burned through hundreds of millions before their screenless wearable became a cautionary tale. The Friend AI pendant, a necklace that records your life and offers companionship, has sparked privacy concerns and existential dread in equal measure. OpenAI's new audio model, slated for early 2026, will reportedly sound more natural, handle interruptions like an actual conversation partner, and even speak while you're talking, which is something today's models can't manage. The company is also said to envision a family of devices, possibly including glasses or screenless smart speakers, that act less like tools and more like companions. As The Information notes, former Apple design chief Jony Ive, who joined OpenAI's hardware efforts through the company's $6.5 billion acquisition in May of his firm io, has made reducing device addiction a priority, seeing audio-first design as a chance to “right the wrongs” of past consumer gadgets.

AMD is set to take the stage at CES in just a few days where it's expected to unveil two new X3D chips, one of them being the 9850X3D, which is said to succeed the existing Ryzen 7 9800X3D. The CPU-Z screenshot and HWBot listing don't tell us exactly what memory was used (apart from DDR5), but it does shine light on the CPU's settings. The overclocker employed an unusually high voltage of 1.688V, which wouldn't be practical in real-world usage. This makes sense since the HWBot page is categorized under single-core peak frequency and not sustained load. As such, liquid nitrogen was expectedly utilized to keep the chip cool, and that translated in the uncore frequency also hitting 2,399.2 MHz — something that actually would make a difference in day-to-day performance. The previous record holder for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D was a Taiwanese overclocker named "Hicookie," who managed to reach 7,313 MHz using a Gigabyte X870 Aorus Tachyon Ice. That might seem like nothing in the grand scheme of things, but comes to world records, every little bit matters. Now it's just a matter of time before another overclocker takes over and the cycle repeats.

And this last point, given the current US political context, seems to be why Real ID is being undermined right now. Many states are actively defying Federal law, so how can they be trusted to comply with the REAL ID requirements?As mentioned in the article; 'Lavoie's declaration says that the agents "needed to further verify his U.S. citizenship because each state has its own REAL ID compliance laws, which may provide for the issuance of a REAL ID to an alien and therefore based on HSI Special Agent training and experience, REAL ID can be unreliable to confirm U.S. If the REAL ID was issued by California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, or Washington, then it's pretty much worthless.Note that Alabama is not in the list above, so the plaintiff's REAL ID should have been enough to immediately validate his status as a US citizen. Instead, he was detained for a short period without just cause.

Almost no one can produce one at a checkpoint if demanded, and its rare for people to even have one in their possession at home.A passport proves citizenship, but its absence doesn't disprove it.Voting cards and social security cards aren't identification. Isn't the key here that an interpretation sets the precedent, and then we don't get continual "reinterpretation"? That's what seems to be happening these days. i guess if enough people perceive that we do. The only context in which DHS claims Real ID is “unreliable” appears to be during mass detentions. That framing reads less like a genuine critique of Real ID and more like a convenient justification: “Sorry, we detained you because you look Mexican. Your Real ID isn't sufficient.”The author then shifts blame onto Real ID itself, rather than on DHS agents who are choosing to ignore it.

On a recent episode of the slate legal podcast they said the SC was trying to figure out a way to reverse this without admitting mistake. My cynical take is kavanaugh thought this would only apply to immigrants, not "real Americans " like him. Yes, but there's no general requirement for a US citizen to have a passport, let alone carry it while in the US. Or really to carry any identification unless operating a motor vehicle on public roads, transiting an airport, or purchasing controlled substances like sudafed, etc.The burden should be on DHS to disprove citizenship.

They are trying to create drama out of something that isn't there. They are trying to create drama out of something that isn't there. If you've got some authoritative reference that states a temporary visitor (less than 6-month) to California needs a CA license, I'd like to see that... Real ID is meant for citizen and non-citizen alike. If they are suspected of some other crime, detain them for that, fine. In CA, as an LPR you can get a REAL ID, but its expiry is not the default of the REAL ID (like not "5/10 years from issuance of the underlying document like a driver's license" but is "if your LPR expires 2 years from now, then your REAL ID driver's licence also expires two years from now"). So it's only really an accurate statement if there's subsequent status changes to pre-empt the LPR status.In WA, as I am, as an LPR I cannot get a REAL ID. Department of Homeland Security makes a lot more sense, but as a non-American, is not an acronym I am familiar with.As a continental European, I do find the ick Anglo countries have with ID weird.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the rare absence of humans reduced some pollution to nature, that sudden change also encouraged more aggressive behavior from invasive species. Then there are cases, like the one involving the dark-eyed juncos in California, that don't quite fit in either category. In a recent paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists reported that during and after the pandemic, dark-eyed juncos experienced two quick evolutionary changes. But in this case, there wasn't any magic or morals about honesty involved—just the consequences of human influence on nature. “We have this idea of evolution as slow because, in general, over evolutionary time, it is slow,” Pamela Yeh, one of the study's lead authors and an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), said in a statement. Dark-eyed juncos generally reside in mountain forests, but in southern California, climate change drove a sizable population of the birds into cities, where they learned to pick off crumbs and scraps from human food waste. When humans make it that much easier, the parts of their bodies, such as their mouths, that animals use for foraging adapt,” Yeh explained. So that included “things like cookies, bread… [and] pizza,” she recalled. “We were quite shocked, to be honest, when we saw just how strong that change was,” Diamant recalled. In such a short period of time, California juncos had essentially “evolved” so that their bills were back to the shape held by their counterparts in the wild. But as pandemic restrictions loosened, UCLA students, faculty, and staff returned to campus. “It is remarkable evidence of these birds' rapid ability to adapt to changes in their environment and food resources,” noted Graciela Gómez Nicola, a biologist at Complutense University of Madrid who was not involved in the study, to Science Media Centre Spain. There have been other recent studies on how exposure to human activity has changed the morphology of wild animals. But juncos are somewhat different from other urban birds like house sparrows or pigeons, the researchers explained. Juncos, by contrast, are territorial and typically nest on the ground. So the dark-eyed juncos of UCLA, as common as they may be on campus, represent an ongoing evolutionary mystery, the researchers concluded. “I don't feel like we have a lot of success stories when we think about how human behavior affects wildlife,” Yeh said. “I wouldn't fully call it a success story yet, but it's not a disaster story, and that's no small thing.” Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more. Why miss a single second of your local birds' feeding frenzy? “When birds are sick, they start doing weird things.” The “ultrablack” fabric could soon become part of cameras, solar panels, telescopes, and more. Smooching might be a familiar behavior, but it's more mysterious than you would probably imagine.</p>

According to Reuters, Samsung and SK hynix were also given import licenses to bring in specialized equipment that used American-made components into their Chinese factories. These three chipmakers used to enjoy validated end-user status, meaning they could freely import restricted items into China without asking for individual licenses. It also said that this “ensures uninterrupted fab operations and product deliveries.” This move to require annual licenses for the Chinese factories of these chipmakers is a part of the White House's effort to keep advanced chipmaking tools out of China. Beijing has been working hard to achieve “semiconductor sovereignty,” just as the U.S. has been trying hard to prevent it from acquiring the latest chips. Aside from that, ASML, the only manufacturer of cutting-edge chipmaking tools, has been banned from exporting its products to China and servicing those that are already installed. Because of this, we've seen reports that the country is covertly working on reverse engineering EUV lithography tools, and that it has even come up with a “Frankenstein” EUV chipmaking tool, but has yet to produce a single chip. This means that these fabs are only limited to mature nodes of 16-nm and up. The revocation of the validated end-user status for the China-based fabs of these companies shows that Washington is tightening its grip on chipmaking machines, even older DUV tech, to make it difficult for Beijing to create its own technology. Despite this, the East Asian nation is pushing hard to develop its own equipment. The central government has even told its chipmakers to use homegrown tools for half of new capacity. And while the country is still years behind cutting-edge tech from ASML and other Western companies, it's slowly taking steps in the right direction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Acemagic's Nintendo-inspired design takes a leaf out of Ayaneo's retro console cloning book. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Acemagic's blog and social media share images and a handful of specs for this AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 machine, which it has dubbed the Retro X5. The maker characterizes this mini PC as “an all-in-one solution created to simplify classic gaming,” which makes us wonder if it will come with Batocera Linux, SteamOS, or another non-Windows OS/UI. Modern mini PC.ACEMAGIC Retro X5 brings classic-inspired design to today's desktop, compact, clean, and built to evolve.Which classic would you revisit first?#ACEMAGIC #retrogames #MiniPC #Retro #AIPC pic.twitter.com/XC6ERlf2AhDecember 30, 2025 The Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 inside is a capable processor, though. This packs in 16 CUs and runs at up to 2.9 GHz. If we are thinking about PC gaming with this processor, it should easily overshadow the Steam Deck. However, you will be targeting higher resolutions on a desktop. We also know that the “Retro X5 supports expandable memory and storage, multiple display outputs, and high-speed connectivity,” as it says so on the blog. Hopefully, that means at least: twin SODIMM slots, twin M.2 SSD slots, HDMI, USB-C monitor connectivity, USB4 or USB5, OCuLink, and Ethernet, multiple extra ports along the back, and built-in Wi-Fi / BT. It looks like Acemagic will try and differentiate its latest mini PC with some kind of launcher, dubbed RetroPlay Box, which you can see represented by swirling tiles in the Tweet embedded above. It could be an app that is pre-installed on Windows 11 – the least adventurous option. There's also the chance that Acemagic might go with a Linux-based OS to host its RetroPlay Box. It may save money on a Windows license by choosing SteamOS or Batocera Linux, for example. Acemagic is riding on the coattails of Ayaneo (and Nintendo) with its “inspired by iconic gaming consoles” design here. But, perhaps its timing, surfing the wave of retro-enthusiasm precipitated by Windows 11 disillusion, the rise of SteamOS, and yet another PC AAA gaming hardware cost crunch, will help it achieve better success.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You still won't get a jailbroken PlayStation 5 with this leak, but it will make it easier for hackers to compromise the console's bootloader. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. According to The Cybersec Guru, this is an unpatchable problem for Sony, because these keys cannot be changed and are burned directly in the APU. Now that the ROM keys have been leaked (and assuming they are valid), a hacker could then decrypt and study the official bootloader and potentially use that as a starting point to understand how the PS5's boot system works. Since the issue is at a hardware level, Sony would not be able to release an update that will stop consoles with the compromised chip from loading kernel-level exploits in the future, should one become available. However, the appearance of these codes means that one of the biggest security features of the console has likely already been compromised, making it easier for those working on creating custom firmware to have a deeper understanding of how the console works and use that knowledge to maybe build a modified (or even a totally different) operating system for it. This isn't the first time that Sony has had to deal with a security crisis with the popular PlayStation family. The PlayStation 3 was previously hit with a vulnerability when the company made a mistake with their cryptography on the console, allowing users to install homebrew software and allow piracy and cheating on popular titles. Another solution is to issue a recall for all existing PlayStation 5 consoles on the market and replace their motherboard to change the hardware codes, but this is unlikely to happen as it's either going to be too costly for the company or gamers would be unwilling to pay extra for a mistake that was ultimately not theirs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First the influencers and manosphere loons added protein to ice cream, and I did not care because I rarely eat ice cream. Protein is not the only thing intrepid Shopify-powered wellness brands are encouraging you to add to coffee, but it's certainly the most high-profile and zeitgeist-y adjunct to pour into your daily brew. Mushroom extracts, nootropics, amino acids, collagen, and a bevy of other chemical compounds purported to make your brain fire on all cylinders are all fair game here, which means the possibilities in this space are nearly endless. Coffee may be the final frontier of protein creep, and we are absolutely here for it. To get a lay of the land, I rigorously tested eight readily available functional coffee add-ins to determine which are legit and which are losers. If your Instagram algorithm is anything like mine you've probably seen targeted ads for Javvy's Protein Creamer, which has mysteriously replaced the Collagen Creamer on almost every corner of the internet. The bag says it contains 10 grams of protein, yet it also says that said protein is 0% of your daily nutritional allotment. The sweetness that buzzes around the aftertaste arrives via Purified Acacia Hyrdolysate, aka Sukre®, which is a nice substitute for the uncanny sugary tang of stevia that's so popular in bougie beverages and supplements these days. This is not something my body could handle on a daily basis now that the excellent brewing skills of the Fellow Aiden have effectively weaned me off coffee creamer, but it's a nice treat when you're hungover or stuck with a subpar coffee situation. Though collagen is at the front and center of this product, I can't present any empirical evidence that it did anything to undo the harm of two-plus decades of alcohol consumption, plus a decade in the dreary Pacific Northwest. The argument regarding the quantifiable benefits of collagen seems unsettled as of yet, though my skin did feel much less irritated than usual after a weekend of eating, drinking, and couchlock around the Thanksgiving holiday, so I'll take that as a win nonetheless. Laird Superfood takes its name from cofounder Laird Hamilton, an infamously aggro big-wave surfer who's best known for being Kevin Costner's stunt double in the 1995 clunker Waterworld. Hamilton and sand volleyball superstar Gabrielle Reece, his wife, founded Laird Superfood in 2015 with the mission of helping the wellness-curious “take something [they] do every day and make it better.” I don't drink protein powder every day, but I do drink enough coffee to drift into space quite often and fantasize about what my life would be like if I had the cojones to get towed by jet ski into a 50-foot wave in Tahiti and hope for the best, like Hamilton did in 2000. Adding dairy-based protein to acidic light roast coffee can be a chunky affair, so it was a pleasant surprise to find that the rib-sticking dose of protein (12g) and saturated fat (10g) that highlights this chunky tan powder is 100% vegan and derived from pumpkins, hemp, and peas. Coconut aversions notwithstanding, this magical dust is a great pick for anyone who wants to add a little more oomph to their morning brew, whether that be some extra protein for gains, or an extra hit of nutrients and satiety that might ward off a pre-lunch snack attack here and there. Rather than overwhelm the senses with a menagerie of bold flavors and pumped-up protein, Earth Fed Muscle plays it safe with a mellow, understated creamer that's just what you want and nothing more. The key selling points on Morning Charge's package are 4 grams of collagen and 500 milligrams of Lion's Mane Extract per serving, plus a light dusting of protein (4 grams per dose) that rounds it off quite nicely without filling you up like an in-your-face protein creamer. This is a solid everyday sipper that's built for comfort first and performance second. Since becoming a barista at the age of 24, my coffee journey has been a long, winding path with quirky creamers and add-ins at every turn. It wasn't until about a year ago that I started drinking the coffee I brew at home every morning black, and in the time since I've been reducing my flavored creamer intake purely because my palate is no longer attuned to a daily blast of sugar. Until trying Everyday Dose's riff on collagen creamer, I just assumed every product in this space was sweetened in one way or another. I personally don't find this bothersome, but the common use of things like monk fruit and stevia to mask the off notes of everything else in the stack could be annoying for hardcore health nuts who find all sweeteners to be excessive or downright evil. Billed as a “Probiotic Powerhouse,” the Creamer+ blend from Everyday Dose is a pleasant surprise when it comes to doing more with less. You can focus hard and pick up earthy flavors under a very light dusting of coconut sweetness, but the overall flavor at the end of the sip defers to the notes of your coffee rather than this smooth white dust that's accented with small brown flecks. By the end of my week with this one, my gut felt extra fortified against the regular barrage of rich, bowel-wrenching foods I dump into it on a daily basis. I won't go into any further detail on this matter, so you'll need to take my word for it when I say the shiny bags' claims about digestive health may actually be true. Rasa is a purveyor of coffee alternatives that occupy the aesthetic halfway point between old money Bay Area hippies and their minimalist millennial offspring. The packaging balances schwilly Deadhead charm with modern flourishes and colors, and their products err on the side of cautious intent rather than psychedelic maximalism. A small dose of mushrooms and ginseng provide the boost in this modest creamer, which offers a mere whisper of coconut flavor that barely registers on the sweetness scale. When mixed with a good light roast coffee with low acidity the end product is a cozy cup of nutty goodness that subtly reminds you it's here to expand your mind ever so slightly. The Bulletproof brand harkens back to this era when characters like Tim Ferris and Mark Manson were encouraging young adults to outsource rote tasks and ditch toxic relationships, and the general notion of improving yourself wasn't automatically hitched to a specific pole of the political spectrum. What started as a quirky DIY trend that pissed off baristas and caused overwhelming GI distress is now a stately brand that predates the ecosystem of fly-by-night snake oil merchants in this space by at least a decade. I'm a sucker for holiday creamers, so I was delighted to learn they carry limited-edition seasonal flavors like pumpkin spice and–my personal favorite–peppermint mocha. This rich brown powder packs a generous dose of smooth mocha flavor with just a light tickle of peppermint and stevia sweetness on the finish. The combo of butter and coconut-derived MCT oil punches up your cup with a rich mouthfeel that makes its presence known but doesn't linger too long. As far as Bulletproof's signature metabolic and cognitive boost goes, I can say with confidence that I missed the brain buzz facilitated by this creamer when my week with it was over. It didn't do much to help me organize my thoughts and tasks while it slowly took hold of my brain, but I was able to harness it quite well by creating a to-do list in advance of consumption, which I then crushed with abandon after a cup of peppermint-y goodness was sloshing around my innards. On that topic, I'm pleased to report that the days of Bulletproof Coffee racing straight through your bowels may be over for most normal people, assuming you stick with the dosage guidelines and avoid taking a two-pound breakfast burrito to the dome before adding this to your coffee. This isn't the perfect product–stevia is not for everyone, and the silty residue it leaves in the bottom of your cup makes your final sip or two pretty gross–but it's noticeably better in both taste and function than everything else I tried in this experiment. The bonus brain tickle from the Lion's Mane and L-Theanine in their Think Organic Coffee creamer is not nothing, but the flavor put forth by this tiny dose–just 8 grams of powder recommended per cup of coffee–is not something I found myself excited to revisit in the week I spent testing this one. If you're on a keto diet and are already used to this style of sweetener, then this is a good fit for you, while anyone who prefers more normie sweeteners (or none at all) may want to avoid Think altogether. Cymbiotika Nootropic Creamer in Coconut Vanilla for $30: During the pandemic, the Pittsburgh-based supplement and fitness store GNC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. They closed over 1,000 stores in the process, and today they're limping along with a patchwork of poorly-stocked, barely-open shops in strip malls and zombie malls across the country. In the end, they survived the pandemic, but a new challenger emerges: app-based clean girl superstores run by businessmen-turned-wellness gurus. Cymbiotika fancies itself as a one-stop shop for wellness influencers and wannabes of all stripes. No matter what your malady or fitness goals may be, this San Diego-based company has a salve, balm, powder, or oil to help. It has very little flavor in its minuscule 5.2 gram dose, and what little flavor it does have is heavy on Stevia. You could up the dose for efficacy, but you probably won't want to after one cup of this astringent, uncanny powder. To add insult to injury, the strip that seals the mylar bag closed is tiny and comes preloaded with a thin coating of powdery gunk, making it impossible to close effectively after just one use. If I had a supplement “stack” that was lacking in Alpha GPC or L-Theanine I suppose this is an acceptable vehicle for filling in those nutritional cracks, but the idea of continuing use of this as a standalone creamer replacement is more unappealing than spending a week at a wellness retreat in the desert led by a guy named Kaarsen who went viral on Tik Tok by explaining the vegetables are bad for you, actually.

But said and done, I came back on Monday, they looked at it again, said it was probably an old filling that was maybe acting up, basically just drilled a bit and filled it back up again. This made it hurt a bit less for about a day (specially during the procedure, even with them drilling into the tooth, local anaesthetic made this the least discomfort I'd been in for almost a week), but since then it's been aching again. It's not as bad as before, but still barely manageable with OTC painkillers.So tomorrow I'm hitting them up again, hopefully I'm able to convince them to pull the tooth, since it's way back in the mouth and has been nothing but causing me grief since I got the original filling, food getting stuck and causing inflammation, that sort of stuff.

Tourism is generally forgettable and I don't recommend it to anyone - save the money and do something where you live.Backpacking feels meaningful in the moment, but is also largely forgettable. I truly have almost no meaningful memories from 2 separate 2 month trips in Europe and southeast Asia.The slow travel is most recent, was the most "boring" but also, I think, most meaningful as I was explicitly focused on self-reflection and discovery of a more meaningful way to live after many years (or a lifetime, really) of aiming to be a better cog in the machine.

I ask because my experience of pleasure travel is very different. More so when there were (i) very little schedule to speak of, other than start and end dates, (ii) had a partner to share the experience of unplanned discovery to share with.Both, I think, make a significant difference to the experience.The other biggie are photographs and writing about it. Both, I think, make a significant difference to the experience.The other biggie are photographs and writing about it. The other biggie are photographs and writing about it. I dont have any idea what this means. Could  you try again in plain english?Yes, not having a schedule makes for better travel, as I described in my later multi-year experience. I think most things could probably be made better by having a genuine life partner to share it with. But doing things solo absolutely does not preclude you from meaning. (moreover, I wouldnt describe most romantic relationships as anything resembling a genuine life partner).Photos and writing are also not inherently meaningful. I did plenty of both and, again, I thought it was all meaningful in the moment, but since realized it was all largely misguided.If someone were to travel in a genuine manner - where you integrate with local communities, get involved with their traditions, problems etc, then that's an entirely other thing. But just roaming (let alone an itinerary) is largely not actually useful, unless you put it towards something meaningful (eg genuine reflection and improvement, which would largely lead you to realizing that travels themselves are not necessary or even important).

This is just not my experience at all. I had a great childhood, but ask me about the most vibrant moments, and very few of them came before I was 18. Maybe it's related to the processing time of images, with smaller brains insect can process more of them per second.Maybe humans process more images as children, therefore see the time time going slower.It's been a while I didn't think about this, maybe some studies have been made in the past years.

There's some lag between starting and being world-class simply because continued practice makes you better. Plus, you get much better at sustained focus and being able to connect disparate training experiences together as your consciousness develops in the teens. How many strong memories from that "logarithmic first half" of my life do I have? Actually very few compared to what came later, and they are not particularly compelling either.My guess is that the author just hit mid-life crisis after having spent one or two decades in an office. Boring mindless job is what makes life experience to plateau, not adulthood. If I think of the most accomplished persons that I know, who've done many things with their life, I can't imagine them saying that their childhood was half of their life.

Or maybe he hasn't reached that crisis yet, since he finds solace in the idea that his child is doing the living for him. “ And don't worry 'bout tomorrow, hey Sha-la-la-la-la-la, live for today” I was saying that you must do both - dont just slave away and expect that you'll live when you're retired (a lifestyle which makes it less likely that you would even live until retirement age, let alone be physically or even mentally capable of enjoying retirement).Instead, live in a way such that there it is meaningful while you do it, and it also prepares you for the future. I remember coming to the realization during my more challenging school years that waiting all week for Saturday to come was literally wishing my life away. I didn't know what burnout was at the time, but an angel of a friend recognized it and helped me understand. Start a company in an industry where you have no experience. Find a new sport and commit to being a top 0.1% participant (for most sports that don't air regularly on national television, this can be done in a year).If subjective life is speeding up, throw yourself some curve balls. If subjective life is speeding up, throw yourself some curve balls. For much of that there have been critical pressures making most days important. Which makes them memorable.Subjectively and objectively, things have changed so much, and so many times, I feel like I have had several lives, so far.Right now I am in a “make” or “break” situation going three productive years. Each problem solved had significant life impact.The indicators for “make” are going up month-to-month now, making it a tough but intense and wonderful time. Feels a lot like my early 20's when I started a dream business (for me) while in school.Definitely don't experience time as indicated by those graphs.

Lots of small things that can help you slow down a little. I can just go buy/see/do with the agency & money I have as an adult.Sure you have a 9-5 (or 8-6, or 7-7) job but you used to go to school and after school activities all day as a kid probably too. It's your choice to do something or nothing with your hours of free time after work and weekends.Small children in the picture adds additional time constraints, but should also bring additional vividness/subjective time experience to your life.

You then are no longer in control of your house, schedule, or really much. But I am fairly confused by the claim that children are interesting and wonder how people spent their pre-children time to arrive at that conclusion – or how much they actually are involved in all the parts of taking care of their kid. > We also think that novelty rivets our attention and makes time seem to slow down. Childhood is full of novel experiences that, as they repeat, become less so. True novelty becomes unusual when you're pushing 60 as I am now. The brain says, “Oh, that again,” and glosses past it. > But what about those of us who are well into the flattening part of the curve, what can we do for ourselves? If time goes faster because your life has fewer firsts and more routine, then it can be extended by adding firsts. You can learn new things, travel, take up hobbies, or new careers.> This works, to a point, but there are only so many firsts for you, and chasing this exclusively seems to lead to resentment. You start to regret that the world has changed, even though what changed the most is you.I like to think that life slows down once you form a stable image and story of yourself.

The big thing which we need to change and solve is education --- I have memories of going to a school in Mississippi which my perception of was that it was quite well run, and that classes in it were divided between academic and social --- social classes were attended at one's age level, while academic classes were attended at one's ability level (4 grade cap up through 8th grade) and that students who progressed beyond high school courses were able to take college courses, some teachers being accredited as faculty at a local college, or instructors from that institution being brought to the school for classes at need.Maybe AP classes offer a similar facility in public school systems? Though one wants to cue the _Doonesbury_ cartoon of the college dean who after being told that his entire Freshman class is taking remedial 051 level _everything_ is running a glorified pre school.Roger Zelazny made much of college education becoming quite a different thing when Samuel Eliot of Harvard made the conceptual leap of dividing education by the college credit hour and allowing customization beyond the rote repetition of previous generations in his wonderful novel _Doorways in the Sand_ --- perhaps that should be extended down on some sort of skills basis? The school I attended after Mississippi did reading with a pair of boxes of Scholastic Reading Assessment (SRA) booklets, which, not understanding that one was supposed to do a two or three at each level and get approval on before moving to the next level, I did _all_ of in a matter of weeks, which left me with nothing to do for the balance of the school year but go to the (meager) elementary school library.

I think it does mean though that optimising for this is probably not the thing to do. I, personally feel like having lived is a net win, joy-wise, mostly on the strength of my childhood. They years get short if you fall into a routine and never do anything new, but it is easy enough not to fall into that trap. And I say that as someone who thrives in doing the same routine every day. I get my variety in the details, doing different projects, having different conversations, trying new foods, exploring new places.>  Childhood memories have an intensity and a vibrancy that it is difficult for the rest of life to match.I've found that we all have different memories.

I don't say that to be mean, either - if your childhood memories are that much stronger than adult ones, that is not the typical human experience, and I would sincerely be asking for medical and psych support to figure out if something is wrong. >  Childhood memories have an intensity and a vibrancy that it is difficult for the rest of life to match.I've found that we all have different memories.

If a good experience makes you wish you could go back to being a child, I'd be recommending therapy because that is not the reaction most adults have to new experiences. I don't say that to be mean, either - if your childhood memories are that much stronger than adult ones, that is not the typical human experience, and I would sincerely be asking for medical and psych support to figure out if something is wrong.

It would explain some things regarding my interactions with most people if I am so completely missing something so fundemental about their existence.Edit: Why does conveying my experience and desiring to understand the experience of others get a downvote?

Nietzsche's ideas where not for producing self-help advice on having hobbies. But I think it's possible the author has some wishful thinking about how experience and memory works. Or perhaps is using a plausible formulation as a reverse justification for his own life choices.Here is how my childhood memories feel to me. Ages 0-14 are like an opaque tunnel, through which my brain and developing body was shot, like a cannonball, in an instant. I have some fragmentary memories of having gone through that tunnel, but they are mere fragment. My 14 year old self, somehow and miraculously, ended up on the other side of that tunnel healthy and of sound mind.Age 14 is around where something resembling "the recorded video of my early memory" begins. I have clear memory of various episodes from ages 14-18, and this was also a period of intense individual development for me. This was where all my inclinations, passions, and life goals started to come into focus. That turned into full-blown adult individuation in college, where my goal was to pull away entirely from societal/parental expectations and live my own life. That might be a depressing thought for parents -- that this kind of blurred and fragmentary memory of childhood is possible, given that parents often describe this period as one where they are "making family memories" -- but I don't think I'm the only one. Good parenting is ethically and developmentally important even when it doesn't leave the child with later-retrievable episodic memories. But I don't think the point of parenting is to create said memories. It's to create a healthy child who can develop and individuate on their own in adulthood.The article talks a lot about childlike wonder, and seeking that in adulthood. But what's strange is that OP seems to believe the only place to find that childlike wonder is in parenting of your own children. People can reclaim their childlike wonder in sport, art, hobby, play, and travel, among other things. What's more, I know many parents who haven't the slightest bit of childlike wonder when they interact with their children. So I'm not sure it comes as naturally to everyone as OP seems to think it does.Two adult thinkers on how adult humans spend their time that have interesting thoughts on childlike play are John Cleese and Alan Watts. Cleese discusses it in the context of creativity in his wonderful lecture, summarized here:https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/04/12/john-cleese-on-cre...And Watts had this to say about it: "... if you don't have a room in your life for the playful, life's not worth living. 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.' But if the only reason for which Jack plays is that he can work better afterwards, he's not really playing. He's just playing because it's good for him! You pick up a pebble on the beach and look at it: beautiful! Don't try and get a sermon out of it." Here is how my childhood memories feel to me.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although iconic founders like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg famously didn't finish college, multiple studies show that the vast majority of successful startups had founders with bachelor's or graduate degrees. It is a phenomenon that cycles in and out of fashion, and right now it is certainly having a moment amid the AI boom. This trend is particularly evident during Y Combinator Demo Days, where founders are increasingly touting their dropout status in their one-minute pitches. “I don't believe YC formally tracks dropout status but, anecdotally, in recent batches, I was struck by how many founders highlight being a dropout from college, grad school, and even high school,” said Katie Jacobs Stanton, founder and general partner of Moxxie Ventures. I think it's perceived as something quite positive in the venture ecosystem.” Yet despite these examples, a growing number of aspiring entrepreneurs fear that staying to graduate means missing the most critical window of the AI building cycle. Some, like Brendan Foody, who co-founded Mercor, have famously dropped out of prestigious schools like Georgetown to pursue their startups. As Kulveer Taggar, founder of the YC-focused venture firm Phosphor Capital, told TechCrunch: “There's just this sense of urgency and maybe FOMO.” There is a calculation right now: “I can finish my degree, or I can just start building.” While some founders fear that a diploma could be a negative signal, Yuri Sagalov, who leads General Catalyst's seed strategy, suggests that VCs are less fixated on the dropout label, especially for students close to graduating: “I don't think I've ever felt any different about someone who graduated or didn't graduate when they're in [their] fourth year and drop out.” While many investors now believe founders can forego a university degree, not all VCs agree that young founders have an edge in this market. Wesley Chan, co-founder of FPV Ventures, isn't as eager to invest in dropouts because he prioritizes a trait most young founders haven't developed yet: wisdom. Chan believes that wisdom is typically found in “older founders or people who have a couple of scars under their belt.” Marina Temkin is a venture capital and startups reporter at TechCrunch.
