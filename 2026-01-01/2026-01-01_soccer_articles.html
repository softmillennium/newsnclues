                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Peppermint Place: Learning some yummy details about donuts DALLAS — If you're looking to get your hands on tickets to the FIFA World Cup, you're gonna need a good amount of luck on your side. Through the first two draws – the Visa exclusive presale and Early Ticket Draw – FIFA said 2 million tickets had been sold. There will be approximately 6 million tickets sold for the entire tournament, according to FIFA. There have been, on average, 10 million ticket applications submitted per day in the Random Selection Draw. If that trend continues through the application window, which closes on Tuesday, Jan. 13, FIFA would receive nearly 300 million applications. As we've stated before, FIFA has sold, on average, 1 million tickets per draw period. That means, you'd have a 1 in 300 chance (0.33%) for your application to be approved. It's unclear just how many tickets will be sold in this window (maybe it'll be more than 1 million, who knows? ), but Infantino said some tickets will be held for subsequent sales phases. It's much better than trying to win the Powerball, where your odds are approximately 1 in 292,000,000 (0.00000034%). But you'd have a better chance of winning any prize in the Powerball, the odds of which are approximately 1 in 24 (4.17%). If the odds of getting FIFA tickets top out at 1 in 150, that means you have the same odds of getting a World Cup ticket as you would of being born with naturally red hair.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's less than 200 days to go until the start of the 2026 World Cup and a clearer picture is beginning to appear regarding the 26-player roster that will represent Mexico in next summer's sporting spectacle. A World Cup on home soil has the entire country excited and anticipation is rapidly building, especially after Mexico's group stage journey was revealed during the 2026 World Cup draw. Fate was kind to El Tri during the draw, with favorable matchups to open the tournament only heightening expectations. A brilliant first semester in 2025 saw Mexico reestablish its dominance over the region with Concacaf Nations League and Gold Cup triumphs. Javier Aguirre must ace his roster selection if El Tri is to have any chance of a historic performance. Aguirre admitted that he already had over half of his World Cup roster set in stone following the Gold Cup, but after poor performances were crowned by a 2–1 defeat against Paraguay, he'll have plenty of time to reconsider. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. Aguirre has used a variety of formations during his year-plus third stint as Mexico's manager, tailoring his side depending on the opponent in front. Only 26 players can make the final World Cup roster so we've stuck to that criteria. The projected roster is based on positional needs, recent squad selections and the hints Aguirre has revealed regarding his talent evaluation. Luis Ángel Malagón appeared to have the position locked up but a massive dip in form—and more importantly confidence—has turned the three-time Liga MX champion into a shell of his former self over the past six months. Though far from perfect, the 25-year-old is a significant upgrade when it comes to ability on the ball, something Malagón has struggled with throughout his career. If the current trajectory persists, Rangel seems to have surpassed Malagón in Aguirre's depth chart. However, given it's unlikely he plays, it's probable Aguirre turns to former World Cup star and El Tri legend Guillermo Ochoa. The curly haired cult hero might be 40 years old, but he'd be a valuable and experienced presence in the dressing room. César Montes and Johan Vásquez have matured into a very strong center back pairing that's able to compete against any forward line on any given day. They're both roster locks and if they arrive to the World Cup at peak form, the heart of defense could easily be Mexico's greatest asset. Jesús Orozco emerged over the past year as an extremely valuable backup, but a terrible ankle injury suffered in December has essentially ended his World Cup hopes, baring a miracle. Angulo has experience playing with El Tri and would be another flexible tool at Aguirre's disposal. Still, his place on the final roster is far from guaranteed, with an open competition brewing to claim a center back spot on the final list. Having only three natural center backs on the list might seem confusing. The devastating injury Rodrigo Huescas suffered in early October saw Aguirre change his approach to fullbacks. Mexico has developed a system in which they build up with a back three in possession, with the starting left back Jesús Gallardo darting up the pitch and Israel Reyes on the other side drifting centrally to offer defensive balance. He's also a solid option at center back, where he's often deployed for Club América, adding a valuable wrinkle to his game. Meanwhile, young AZ Alkmaar left back Mateo Chávez has had a couple of impressive performances with El Tri and should be on the final roster barring any unforeseen circumstances. Kevin Álvarez, who featured in the 2022 World Cup, is a fringe option that has the potential of challenging Sánchez for a spot on Aguirre's roster. Mexico's captain Edson Álvarez anchoring the midfield with Montés and Vásquez behind him completes what Aguirre named “The Triangle of Trust.” Álvarez is a duel-winning machine that protects the middle of the park, but it also wouldn't be surprising if he features at center back next summer, given he's El Tri's best alternative other than the starting duo. An argument could be made that Cruz Azul's Erik Lira has been one of Mexico's best players of the Aguirre era. His path to consistent playing time is blocked by Álvarez, but he'll be on the roster and could be a starter against opponents that sit back and allow Mexico to have the bulk of the ball. Toluca's Marcel Ruiz has become an undisputed starter as a box-to-box No. Then comes the biggest difference-maker in Mexico's roster: Gilberto Mora. The same goes for attacking midfielder Orbelín Pineda, a player Aguirre has tried endlessly to insert into Mexico's lineup. It's difficult to put into words how much Mexico has struggled to find production from its wingers since the start of the decade. Although he's not a one-on-one threat, he's got an educated left foot and Aguirre's repeatedly praised his ability to cut inside to link-up with other attackers in the final third. Diego Lainez and former World Cup hero Hirving “Chucky” Lozano have elevated their status with the national team in recent months, featuring in the last three El Tri camps of 2025. They seem to have carved themselves a backup role at the very least. There was plenty of expectation put on Julián Quiñones when the Colombia-born attacker switched his allegiance to Mexico prior to the 2024 Copa América. He's failed to live up to the hype for now, but he's still got every chance to make the World Cup roster, especially if he keeps producing in the Saudi Pro League. For the first time in his career and entering his fourth World Cup, Raúl Jiménez is poised to spearhead Mexico's attack next summer. AC Milan's Santiago Gimenez was touted by many to play alongside Jiménez next summer. Aguirre struggled to accommodate the pair in the same XI and Gimenez's dreadful start of the season and recent injury woes makes it hard to imagine he'll be anything but a backup next summer. If he can keep up his level during the next six months, he's got every chance to play himself into a more prominent role. Argentina-born striker Germán Berterame completes the forward line.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Enzo Maresca's departure from Chelsea has sparked movement elsewhere, with Strasbourg manager Liam Rosenior reportedly among the candidates under consideration at Stamford Bridge, according to The Guardian. Should Rosenior leave for Chelsea, Minnesota United head coach Eric Ramsay has been linked as a potential replacement at Strasbourg. Minnesota finished fourth in MLS's Western Conference last season. Minnesota United could face uncertainty in the new year, with head coach Eric Ramsay reportedly linked to a potential move to Europe amid Chelsea's search for a new manager following Enzo Maresca's departure midway through the Premier League season. According to The Guardian, Chelsea are assessing several candidates, including Strasbourg manager Liam Rosenior, as they look to fill the vacancy at Stamford Bridge. Porto head coach Francesco Farioli is also believed to be in the frame, with Chelsea hopeful of making an appointment in the coming days. In that scenario, Ramsay has been linked as a potential option to take over at the Ligue 1 side, creating a possible knock-on effect. Ramsay began his coaching career in youth football, working with Swansea City and Shrewsbury Town before spending two years in Chelsea's academy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an incredible turn of events, Gabon's government has announced that it has suspended the national team after their horrendous African Cup of Nations campaign, and have also sacked their manager, whilst removing ex-Arsenal and Chelsea striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from the squad altogether. The Panthers lost their opener 1-0 to Cameroon, before going down 3-2 in a thriller against Mozambique. They were then beaten 3-2, again, by the Ivory Coast, thanks to an injury-time strike from Bazoumana Toure. Manager Mouyouma was only the second manager to guide Gabon to the AFCON, favouring a high-pressing, high intensity style of play that had drawn success in qualification. At the tournament, though, Gabon were leaky, and unable to turn their high-press into wins. The Gabon boss responded: "This contempt must stop. We are playing in an Africa Cup of Nations, not a recovery camp. Gabon's acting sports minister made a public address 24 hours after the side's defeat to Cote d'Ivoire. He missed the clash with Cote d'Ivoire after suffering an injury. Aubameyang's ban from selection may bring the curtain down on a lengthy international career. In total, he won 49 caps, scoring 28 goals, having played for his country between 2009 and 2025. It appears, though, that he will not play again.

They had hoped to reach the 2026 World Cup, having finished second in their qualifying group, but they lost in the play-offs to Nigeria, being thumped 4-1. It remains to be seen when the national team will be put back together; FIFA has usually taken a hard stance against the idea of nations disbanding their teams, and is a rarity now in African football.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Chelsea was back on the coaching carousel under its American ownership on Thursday after Enzo Maresca left his position as manager following a reported deterioration in his relationship with the Premier League club's hierarchy. The Italian coach was midway through his second year in charge, having won the Conference League and Club World Cup in his first season at Chelsea. However, the team has endured a turbulent last few months — Chelsea has won just one of its last seven Premier League matches to drop to fifth place — while Maresca publicly expressed his unhappiness at a lack of support at the club in a post-match news conference on Dec. 13, when he said he had just experienced his “worst” 48 hours at Chelsea. Chelsea has advanced to the English League Cup semifinals, where it will play Arsenal over two legs, and begins its FA Cup campaign away to second-tier Charlton on Jan. 10. Chelsea is seeking a fifth full-time manager since the takeover of the club by American investors, fronted by Todd Boehly, in May 2022. In the past 3 1/2 years, Chelsea has spent hundreds of million of pounds (dollars) in what looked from the outside a chaotic bid to sign players to refresh its squad. It now has one of the youngest and most talented squads in the Premier League, with star players including Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Estevao, but managers have struggled to get the players to gel as a team after so many changes. A few weeks ago, media reports in England linked Maresca with a possible move to Man City — where he briefly worked under Pep Guardiola — should Guardiola eventually leave, though Maresca played the reports down. Its next game is at plays second-place Manchester City on Sunday. Chelsea said its achievements under Maresca “will remain an important part of the club's recent history, and we thank him for his contributions to the club.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maresca guided Chelsea to Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup glory last season, while also securing Champions League qualification, and had been working on a contract through to 2029. He now finds himself out of work, with the Blues opening their hunt for a suitable successor. A statement on the club's official website reads: "Chelsea Football Club and Head Coach Enzo Maresca have parted company. Those achievements will remain an important part of the Club's recent history, and we thank him for his contributions to the club. While victory was enjoyed over the Toffees, a three-game winless run has been endured in the Premier League since then. Maresca's final game at the helm was a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth. They sit fifth in the English top-flight table heading into fixtures taking place on New Year's Day. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. The Blues will be back in action on Sunday when taking in a testing trip to Manchester City. It remains to be seen who will be in charge of that contest, but Chelsea will want to move quickly when it comes to getting another permanent boss on board. It has been suggested that Liam Rosenior, who is currently in charge of the Blues' sister club Strasbourg, is among those under consideration. Maresca earned plenty of credit after landing major silverware - having previously led Leicester to the Championship title when filling his first managerial role in England - but saw that evaporate late in 2025. While he will not be lining up against Pep Guardiola again this weekend - having filled two roles among backroom staff at the Etihad Stadium - it has been claimed that he is viewed by City as a potential successor to their highly-decorated Catalan coach. Guardiola is known to be a big fan of his former right-hand man and has seen it suggested that he could walk away from Manchester at the end of the current campaign. Maresca will be eager to land another role as quickly as possible, having proved his worth at the highest level. His overall record at Chelsea saw 55 victories collected from 92 games across all competitions, with 21 defeats being suffered.</p>
