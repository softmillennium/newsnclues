The idea for Destroy All Humans emerged out of frustration at seeing months of hard work go to waste. Pandemic Studios' Australian team were devastated when Oddballs, a quirky co-operative game they were developing, was shelved by Microsoft for lacking edge. In response, they created something radically different that became an unexpected cult classic. Destroy All Humans (hereafter referred to as DAH!) was released on PS2 and Xbox in the summer of 2005. In a delightful twist that captured the imagination of players, they were tasked with becoming the bad guy, someone intent on conquering Earth rather than saving it. "It was a funny game – really offbeat and quite different to things that were around at the time. Grand Theft Auto came out just before we were really making Destroy All Humans and then the publishers all wanted to have stuff like that, that was dark and gritty." This feature originally appeared in Retro Gamer magazine #271. For more in-depth features and interviews on classic games delivered to your door or digital device, subscribe to Retro Gamer or buy an issue! An offshoot of the original Pandemic, based in Los Angeles, their office was in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane.The first game they delivered was 2002's solid if uninspiring Army Men: RTS. "After Oddballs didn't get picked up, we started brainstorming again. We had an email trail of like 60 or 70 games that we were pitching, including some joke ones," recalls designer Dan Teasdale. I remember very clearly, it was right before we were going to lunch at this teriyaki place, and we were constantly riffing on this idea. bore little resemblance to the final game. The UFO was the primary focus as you flew around cities destroying buildings and gathering humans to feed to space beasts. The team were fascinated with the idea of these grotesque monsters that grew as they consumed people and could eventually be used to wreak havoc. "I do still miss space beasts," says Creagh. "Memory would maybe have been a problem, but I think one of the excuses was that it didn't fit into the Roswell mythology of aliens. Whereas we all just wanted to be able to collect humans as meat, process them into giant space beasts and unleash them back onto the unwitting inhabitants of Earth! Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more It was a funny game – really offbeat and quite different to things that were around at the time. Another significant change reshaped DAH!, bringing its protagonist, Cryptosporidium-137, to the fore. Teasdale remembers concern from higher management, and publisher THQ, that the game's focus was too narrow. "Instead of being 80% UFO and 20% on foot, we basically flipped it," he says. It's more about exploring on foot and being closer to Crypto as a character, which is one of the reasons that people still talk about it." A belligerent, wise-cracking alien soldier, he's determined to take revenge on humanity after his predecessor, Cryptosporidium-136, is captured by the US army. All snarling disdain and hair-trigger temper, the impulsive Crypto is given orders by Orthopox, his superior officer, but doesn't always follow them. "We wanted that dynamic where Crypto's a loose cannon and he's going to have to be reined in," explains Teasdale. Then there was a publisher push that was like, 'Hey, what if you have his voice more like Jack Nicholson?' There was a lot of doubt, but we put that in and it worked. The way we developed his character reflects that. Both named after causes of disease, Pox and Crypto are the game's two main characters. They are Furons, members of an advanced alien race from the planet Furon, whose defining features are grey skin, large heads, sharp teeth and an insatiable lust for power. But using atomic weapons with wild abandon has caused a damaging genetic mutation, leaving Furons without genitalia and unable to reproduce. We wanted to collect humans as meat, process them into giant space beasts and unleash them back onto the unwitting inhabitants of Earth! Cloning has proved unreliable, introducing more errors to their genetic code, so an infusion of pure Furon DNA, which can be found in human brain stems, is needed to save them from extinction. For the Furons to prosper, humans must be killed and Crypto is eager to do the honours. Sent down to Earth, Crypto's first port of call on this 'crummy planet' is Turnipseed Farm, where he mistakenly interrogates a cow before humans are alerted to his presence. Drawing on a wealth of sci-fi classics and schlocky B-movies, Pandemic already had much of Crypto's path through America laid out for it. 's twenty-two missions are split across six different fictional locations – the remote Turnipseed Farm, rural Midwestern town Rockwell, Californian suburb Santa Modesta, industrial port Union Town, the secretive Area 42, and seat of power Capitol City. It was kind of written for us," says Teasdale. I think the tone is also a product of it being built in Australia. We have a larrikin culture of trying to make other people laugh. is packed full of genre-film references, satire, parody and pop-culture savvy.Throughout, a young Australian team enjoyed affectionately mocking American society, its omnipotent self-image and predictable cinematic tropes. They created a world where hidden conspiracies lurked beneath the shiny façade of big cars, fast food, drive-in movies, celebrity worship and tabloid media. "Comedy in games is depressingly rare as time goes on. I think the tone is also a product of it being built in Australia. We have a larrikin culture of trying to make other people laugh." "Our struggle on the comedy side was just having faith in ourselves. You write a joke and then you have to hear it over and over again for the next two or three years. Then you'd put it in front of someone else and they'd be cracking up." Often silly and immature, some jokes, especially those concerning Miss Rockwell, were uncomfortably crude and have aged poorly.It was notable that the 2020 remaster of DAH! Throughout his invasion, Crypto often favours blunt force, but mind control, speed and stealth are sometimes required to achieve his aims as Pandemic attempted to balance out the rampant destruction and make DAH! There are no checkpoints within missions, so failure means starting over again, which isn't a problem until the game's final stages when the difficulty level notably increases. isn't particularly challenging, with simple goals and forgiving combat sequences. As Teasdale acknowledges, the team wanted to create a fun and memorable experience above all else. It was about the joy of being Crypto – the freedom to explore unique environments and cause random chaos. The ragdoll effect of the Havok physics engine made blowing up enemies or flinging radioactive cows around feel immensely satisfying. With upgrades available as the story progresses, Crypto gains access to an entertaining array of weapons (the Zap-O-Matic, Anal Probe, Disintegrator Ray and Ion Detonator).His flying saucer boasts several more – the Death Ray, Abducto Beam, Quantum Deconstructor, and Sonic Boom – each serving different purposes. He also has a jetpack to travel over shorter distances and psychokinetic abilities to imitate human appearance, read minds or move objects. Overpowered as Crypto may be for some early missions, the sheer ingenuity and fun factor is worth it. Lumbered with 'stone tools' compared to today's technology, Creagh recalls Pandemic's improvisational approach to cramming so many elements into the game. All the programmers had to be supremely capable. "When you're surrounded by people who are good at their jobs, there's no embitterment about anyone not pulling their weight, although there was one infamous funny guy who'd fall asleep through the day. After overcoming so many obstacles to make it this far, E3 2004 was a major turning point. Suddenly, the pressure was on to meet rising expectations. "Going from four of us on a couch throwing around dumb ideas to walking into E3 and having a huge theatre recreated in the middle of South Hall with Crypto standing on top of it was like, 'Holy shit! Seeing people excited about it and lining up to see the booth demo was incredible," says Teasdale. We survived that and generated a lot of interest because our game was different. But it was also like, 'Oh, fuck, we've got to make the rest of this now.' Getting good feedback is like the point of no return." Getting good feedback is like the point of no return. Towards the end, extra staff had to be drafted in from LA. There were cases where it was too much. People just disappeared and we never saw them again. We were all in our 20s so we put our lives on hold for a year and broke ourselves making this game," says Teasdale. It comes down to this very existential thing of like, 'Why do we make games?' The reason I make games is because I want to make people happy and put joy into the world. If that's what we've done, then it wasn't for nothing." I want to make people happy and put joy into the world. If that's what we've done, then it wasn't for nothing. Although Pandemic eschewed the dark realism of GTA, it did imitate its map style and alert system. As Crypto's activities draw more attention, he is pursued by escalating law enforcement agencies – the police, the army and the Majestic, a shadowy FBI-style organisation overseen by Silhouette, his ultimate adversary. The game received broadly positive reviews, averaging 76 on Metacritic for the Xbox, and sold more than one million copies in its first year. While it wasn't to everyone's tastes, with some complaints about frustrating stealth missions and the arbitrary restrictions of its open-world environment, its sheer boldness made a strong and lasting impression. After leaving Pandemic, Teasdale enjoyed huge commercial success with Rock Band, but found that it's rare to provoke the same instinctive affection that Crypto's first adventure did. "It landed in a way that I don't think we really expected. Still living in Australia, Creagh has had similar experiences, demonstrating DAH! It somehow made such an impact on their lives. For a while, you felt like a bit of a worker termite completing it, but at least the days and nights you spent working late were time well spent."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" ending in 2003 and its spin-off series "Angel" wrapping the following year, there was a huge gap for a new horror-infused supernatural drama series to step into by the midpoint of the aughts. In 2005, Eric Kripke filled that gap with "Supernatural," which would run for a whopping 15 seasons and amass a dedicated fanbase along the way. All the seasons were on Netflix for over a decade, but the show has a new streaming home now: Amazon Prime Video. Led by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, "Supernatural" centers on Sam and Dean Winchester, a pair of brothers who make it their business to hunt down creatures of the night — vampires, werewolves, witches, goblins, you name it. But the show is about so much more than just hunting monsters; it's a family tale with deeply religious themes that are sometimes very overt. It's also way more than a regular drama, with lots of romance, tons of laughs, a stinging wit, and some genuine scares for good measure. "Supernatural" became somewhat hit and miss over the course of its 15-year lifespan, though when the show does hit, it hits hard. It's safe to say that the ending of "Supernatural" was controversial. "We did a rewrite once we knew what our COVID rules were going to be for episodes 19 and 20," co-showrunner Andrew Dabb confirmed to Entertainment Weekly. Several former cast members were initially set to reprise their roles for the finale, but this just wasn't workable under the restrictions imposed during COVID-19, which changed Hollywood forever. This altered ending has only amplified calls for a "Supernatural" revival. While there's nothing official in the works, Jensen Ackles said that he would never say never when he appeared on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" in 2025. "I think there's a reason we did it for 15 years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, on a one-way interstellar journey through our Solar System, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb suggested it might be an alien spacecraft paying us a visit. In fact, despite their somewhat unusual properties, both celestial bodies appear to be completely natural, and most astronomers dismiss Loeb's speculative assertions. What if we really did find a piece of alien hardware? And while Breakthrough Listen uses radio telescopes around the world to search for possible interstellar broadcasts – an approach known as SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) – astronomers are now thinking seriously about how to broaden the search by looking for ‘technosignatures', other telltale traces of alien technology. In his 1973 science-fiction novel Rendezvous with Rama, Arthur C Clarke described the discovery and subsequent exploration of a huge alien craft that happened to pass through our Solar System. Five years earlier, in 2001: A Space Odyssey, Clarke and director Stanley Kubrick imagined how mysterious beings left huge monoliths behind in the Solar System to guide the slow progress of human evolution. But while many people believe that UFOs (unidentified flying objects) and UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena) are proof of alien visits, no one has ever come up with undisputed evidence that ET has rung our doorbell. Then again, evidence of alien technology might also be found in the distant Universe, and not just in the form of artificial radio messages. In fact, any weird, inexplicable astronomical observation could potentially hint at the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence (though most astronomers like to warn: “It's never aliens”). Jason Wright of Pennsylvania State University, for one, likes to keep an open mind. “Is it likely that we will ever discover technosignatures?”, he asks. In 1959, physicists Giuseppe Cocconi and Philip Morrison first suggested that radio telescopes could be used to eavesdrop on alien communications. It seems incredibly unlikely that life has only emerged once. Using sensitive instruments such as the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers are now able to sniff out the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets in the hope of finding so-called biosignatures – molecules that hint at biological activity on an alien planet's surface. So far, no convincing detections have been reported, although a team led by Cambridge astrophysicists has claimed the detection of dimethyl sulphide in the atmosphere of planet K2-18b. The discovery of biosignatures may have to wait for future facilities like the European Extremely Large Telescope or NASA's proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory. After all, biosignatures are produced by each and every form of life – even single-celled organisms – while technosignatures require the emergence of intelligence and technology. But in a 2022 paper, Wright and his colleagues argued that technosignatures (including radio transmissions) might actually be easier to detect. For one thing, technosignatures could be more abundant, as one single technologically advanced civilisation might spread across multiple planets or even planetary systems. Humanity itself is a case in point, albeit at a modest level: while our biosignatures can only be found on Earth, our hardware is scattered throughout the Solar System – and even beyond. Even if the intelligent aliens become extinct, their environmental impact, buildings, machines or self-replicating robots could remain detectable for a very long time. Technosignatures – in particular, radio signals – can also be detected over much larger distances than biosignatures, which can only be found (if at all) within a few tens of lightyears. While molecules like oxygen, ozone, methane and even dimethyl sulphide can also be produced by non-biological processes (at least in principle), the discovery of a black monolith on the Moon, or a radio signal containing the first million decimals of pi, would be definitive proof of extraterrestrial intelligence. One particular type of potential technosignature (other than alien radio transmissions) was described by visionary Princeton physicist Freeman Dyson back in 1960, just one year after the landmark paper by Cocconi and Morrison. These, he argued, could be huge artificial spheres, constructed by a highly advanced civilisation around their parent star, to collect as much energy as possible. Physics dictates that the outer surface of such a sphere would emit infrared radiation. The idea was first proposed by science-fiction writer Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel Star Maker, although the concept has subsequently become known as a Dyson sphere. "Collecting energy is probably a fundamental and universal trait of intelligent civilisations," he says. Perhaps you don't need a complete sphere, but even a huge ring of energy-collecting solar panels would be detectable through its heat radiation, or because it might block some of its star's light. But Dyson spheres and other potential alien megastructures, as they are collectively called, are still very much on the radar of SETI researchers. But according to Siemion, any anomalous astronomical object deserves special attention, as it might be our first encounter with alien technology. Only later did it became clear that pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars. Fast radio bursts, first discovered in 2007, have also been assigned to aliens, by (who else?) Keeping ET in the back of your head is good for science too, according to a 2023 online paper by astronomers Beatrice Villarroel and Geoffrey Marcy. Wright admits that the chance of success in the search for technosignatures strongly depends on how often life will result in technology – something we simply don't know. "If we ever find extraterrestrial life, it won't resemble homo sapiens in any way," he said. South African archeologist Sarah Wurz voiced a similar concern. Siemion, who co-organised the symposium, realises that anthropocentrism is a real problem in our thinking about SETI and extraterrestrial technology. "Maybe we're indeed on a completely wrong track," he said, staring at his eye-catching, alien-green shoe laces, "and there's no guarantee that we will ever find extraterrestrial intelligence. But, of course, that doesn't mean we're giving up." That's why an international group of astronomers, led by James Davenport of the University of Washington and including Jason Wright, Andrew Siemion and The Sky at Night's own Chris Lintott, published a paper on how to look for telltale anomalies in the shape, colour and trajectory of the many interstellar objects that are expected to be found by the new Vera C Rubin Observatory in Chile. Who knows, even comet 3I/ATLAS could be a hollow body harbouring an alien habitat. "The presence of ‘normal' behaviour, such as natural cometary activity, or surface colours consistent with bare asteroids, should not deter our follow-up observations aimed at constraining technosignatures," the authors write.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're still a bit distraught that Supernatural has been axed from Netflix's roster and moved to Prime Video instead, then consider zipping over to yet another streamer for a quick break between binges. Yes, we all love Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles' adventures as Sam and Dean Winchester, but if you're looking for something familiar yet still hoping to mix it up a little, consider giving The Winchesters a try. That was the same mindset of former Supernatural writer Robbie Thompson and even Jensen Ackles, who united after the flagship series ended to further expand this paranormal universe. Even better, the complete series can be streamed on HBO Max. You may have heard of The Winchesters a few years ago, only for the buzz to fade about as quickly as it began. A spin-off from the flagship dark fantasy drama, this series takes place in an alternate universe from Sam and Dean's world in the early 1970s. That was a bit of a spoiler to those who watched the show live — and were trying to discern why the Winchester family timeline wasn't quite matching up with Supernatural — but if you can view the show as an alternate take on John Winchester (Drake Rodger) and Mary Campbell (Meg Donnelly) from the onset, you may enjoy it far better in the long run. Before they become the eponymous power couple, John and Mary meet in their hometown of Lawrence, Kansas, just as John returns from Vietnam and Mary takes to the streets to search for her missing father, Samuel Campbell (played by Tom Welling). Alongside John and Mary is lore-expert Lata Desai (Nida Khurshid), longtime demon hunter Carlos Cervantez (Jojo Fleites), and their older advisor Ada Monroe (Demetria McKinney). Together, they tackle everything from terrifying werewolves that put Supernatural's best monsters to shame, vengeful pagan gods, frightening djinn, and even the return of Richard Speight Jr. as this world's greatest trickster, Loki. While Jared Padalecki has gone on record praising "Carry On" as one of his favorite episodes, Jensen Ackles doesn't appear to have felt the same way. Either way, this dark fantasy horror is a quick binge that will no doubt hold Supernatural fans over between binges, and it's a fine companion piece that is, in some ways, vital to a better, more fulfilling ending for Dean Winchester. On Supernatural, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Samantha Smith played the older versions of these characters, but we rarely ever saw them on screen together. Even with the younger versions seen in the show's fourth and fifth seasons, played by Matt Cohen and Amy Gumenick, we never fully got to see their romance blossom. Despite taking place in a parallel world, The Winchesters aims to rectify that. The show largely centers on John and Mary's similar searches for the truth about their respective fathers, opening the door to John's place as a legacy in the Men of Letters and Mary's expanded role as a leader of a team of hunters. But even as they uncover these important truths about their life and destiny, they grow closer and begin to fall in love – and it's here where the show finds its emotional anchor. While Mary holds her family secrets close to the chest and John is still working through a broken engagement, The Winchesters puts these two through the fire as they battle monsters, demons, and other paranormal creatures alongside their friends. As they search more diligently for the truth about their fathers, their friendship naturally transforms into something far more intimate. While Supernatural once revealed that Cupid was responsible for putting John and Mary together to ensure Sam and Dean's birth, The Winchesters makes no such claims, instead providing an alternate tale where the pair can find happiness and family all on their own without the direct influence of otherworldly forces. Sure, the supernatural still brings them together, in a sense, but it's a happy accident that leads to, from what the title suggests, a long-time romance that may just give the Winchester family the ending that Sam and Dean always dreamed of. Off-camera, Rodger and Donnelly are romantically involved, and while that doesn't have to be the case for actors playing characters in love with one another, it certainly helps. The pair feel as natural on the screen as their Supernatural predecessors, and when their professional partnership turns into something more romantic, audiences were overjoyed. Considering the show is called The Winchesters, it was bound to happen at some point, though for many it couldn't happen soon enough. The sad truth is that Supernatural has never had great luck with spin-off projects, and The Winchesters was another attempt that was axed well before it's time. "With a massive network shift coupled with an industry strike…welp," Ackles wrote on X after the announcement was made, "that's some unfortunate timing." The CW had been sold in 2023, and that year's writer's strike didn't help either. It seems that the fates did not favor The Winchesters, after all, even after a solid finale that tied back directly to Supernatural. Perhaps one day, if Supernatural were to return, maybe Sam and Dean would be willing to catch up with The Winchesters story in a single one-and-done multiversal crossover? Then again, that may just be wishful thinking. The Winchesters is available for streaming on HBO Max. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LAS VEGAS (KSNV) — Chad Ollinger, a 41-year-old reality TV star known for his role on Discovery's "Mystery at Blind Frog Ranch," is facing an open murder charge after allegedly killing his cellmate, Christopher Kelly, at the Clark County Detention Center. The incident occurred on December 26th, and Ollinger is set to face a competency hearing later in January. Ollinger continues by describing the killing as "necessary" and "righteous." The arrest report says Ollinger told officers he has been able to identify child predators in the past, and "had a responsibility to identify child predators because he had his own children taken away from him." Ollinger allegedly admitted to strangling Kelly and smashing his head into a metal bedframe post. The hearing, set for January 21, will determine if Ollinger is competent to stand trial. Lovell says that if deemed incompetent but treatable, proceedings will be suspended for treatment. If found incompetent without the possibility of restoration, charges could be dismissed, potentially leading to a civil commitment process. If found competent, the trial will proceed as normal. Ollinger, originally taken into custody on trespassing and larceny charges on October 27th, remained in detention after being identified as a fugitive from another state.</p>
