Rescuers in the area where a fire broke out leaving people dead and injured, during New Year's celebration, in Crans-Montana, Swiss Alps, Switzerland, Thursday, Jan. 1, 2026. CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) — Swiss investigators are probing what caused a fire in a bar at an Alpine ski resort that left around 40 people dead and another 115 injured during a New Year's celebration. Most injuries, many of them serious, occurred when the blaze swept through the crowded bar less than two hours after midnight Thursday in southwestern Switzerland. The Crans-Montana resort is best known as an international ski and golf venue. Crans-Montana is less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Sierre, Switzerland, where 28 people, including many children, were killed when a bus from Belgium crashed inside a Swiss tunnel in 2012. Here's what we know about the deadly fire: People frantically tried to escape from the basement nightclub up a narrow flight of stairs and through a narrow door, causing a crowd surge, one of the women said. A young man at the scene said people smashed windows to escape the fire, some gravely injured, reported BFMTV. He said he saw about 20 people scrambling to get out of the smoke and flames, likening what happened to a horror movie. While officials said Thursday it was too early to determine the fire's cause, investigators have already ruled out that it could have been an attack. Experts have not yet been able to go inside the wreckage, said Beatrice Pilloud, Valais Canton attorney general, at a news conference. Work is underway to identify the victims and inform their families, according to Valais Canton police commander Frédéric Gisler. The Swiss officials called the blaze an “embrasement généralisé,” a French firefighting term describing how a blaze can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft. Victims suffered from serious burns and smoke inhalation. Some were flown to specialist hospitals across the country. Authorities urged people to show caution in the coming days to avoid any accidents that could require the already overwhelmed medical resources. With high-altitude ski runs rising around 3,000 meters (nearly 9,850 feet) in the heart of the Valais region's snowy peaks and pine forests, Crans-Montana is one of the top venues on the World Cup circuit. The resort will host the best men's and women's downhill racers, including Lindsey Vonn, for their final events before the Milan Cortina Olympics in February.</p>

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump defended his energy and health in an interview with The Wall Street Journal and disclosed that he had a CT scan, not an MRI scan, during an October examination about which he and the White House delayed offering details. Trump, in the interview, said he regretted undergoing the advanced imaging on his heart and abdomen during an October visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center because it raised public questions about his health. His physician said in a memo the White House released in December that he had “advanced imaging” as a preventative screening for men his age. Trump had initially described it as an MRI but said he didn't know what part of his body he had scanned. A CT scan is a quicker form of diagnostic imaging than an MRI but offers less detail about differences in tissue. Sean Barbabella, said in a statement released Thursday by the White House that Trump underwent the exam in October because he planned to be at Walter Reed to meet people working there. Trump had already undergone an annual physical in April. “President Trump agreed to meet with the staff and soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Hospital in October. Barbabella said that he asked the president to undergo either a CT scan or MRI “to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues” and the results were “perfectly normal and revealed absolutely no abnormalities.” “I would have been a lot better off if they didn't, because the fact that I took it said, ‘Oh gee, is something wrong?' The 79-year-old became the oldest person to take the oath of office when he was sworn in as president last year and has been sensitive to questions about his health, particularly as he has repeatedly questioned his predecessor Joe Biden's fitness for office. But questions have also swirled around Trump's health this year as he's been seen with bruising on the back of his right hand that has been conspicuous despite a slathering of makeup on top, along with noticeable swelling at his ankles. The White House this summer said the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition among older adults. In the interview, Trump said he briefly tried wearing compression socks to address the swelling but stopped because he didn't like them. “They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Trump, in the interview, denied he has fallen asleep during White House meetings when cameras have caught him with his eyes closed, instead insisting he was resting his eyes or blinking. The president dismissed questions about his hearing, saying he only struggled to hear “when there's a lot of people talking,” and said he has plenty of energy, which he credited to his genes.</p>

This image made from undated video provided by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025, shows a downed drone at an undisclosed location that it said was one of the Ukrainian drones involved in an alleged attack on a residence of President Vladimir Putin this week – a claim Kyiv has denied as a “lie”. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone strike killed 24 people and wounded at least 50 more as they celebrated the New Year in a Russian-occupied village in Ukraine's Kherson region, Russian officials said Thursday, as tensions between the two nations continue to spike despite diplomats hailing productive peace talks. He said that one of the drones carried an incendiary mixture, sparking a blaze. Ukrainian officials did not immediately comment on the claim of a strike. The attack was condemned by a number of Russian officials. The statement follows claims from Moscow that Ukraine launched a long-range drone attack against one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's official residences in northwestern Russia on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Russia's Defense Ministry also released a video on Wednesday of a downed drone it said was involved in the attack. Kyiv has called the allegations of an attack on Putin's residence a ruse to derail ongoing peace negotiations, which have ramped up in recent weeks on both sides of the Atlantic. In his New Year's address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a peace deal was “90% ready” but warned that the remaining 10%, believed to include key sticking points such as territory, would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live.” Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that he, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner had a “productive call” with the national security advisers of Britain, France, Germany and Ukraine “to discuss advancing the next steps in the European peace process.” “We focused on how to move the discussions forward in a practical way on behalf of (Trump's) peace process, including strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart,” Witkoff said in a post on X. Lead Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov also reaffirmed that European and Ukrainian officials plan to meet Saturday, while Zelenskyy is due to hold talks next week with European leaders. In the diplomatic sphere, Kyiv has also continued to push the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to take action against Russia for alleged attacks on electricity infrastructure deemed “critical for nuclear safety and security” at Ukraine's nuclear power stations. The IAEA on Tuesday published a Note Verbale sent by Kyiv to the agency, saying that a Russian drone and missile attack on Dec. 23 had caused certain Ukrainian nuclear power plants to lose a “significant part of their off-site power connections.” Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russia attacked the Odesa region overnight, targeting civilian infrastructure in several waves of drone attacks, according to regional head Oleh Kiper. In its daily report, Ukraine's air force said air defense forces had downed or suppressed 176 of 205 drones targeting the country overnight. It said hits by 24 strike drones were recorded at 15 locations and the attack was still ongoing. Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</p>

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Keionte Scott peeked over at the Miami sideline to see the reaction of his teammates as he sprinted 72 yards untouched for a touchdown returning an interception against defending national champion Ohio State. They certainly were excited, as were a Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver and a former coach who won national championships with the Hurricanes. Scott picked off a screen pass by Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin, Carson Beck threw a touchdown pass and 10th-ranked Miami shocked the Buckeyes 24-14 on Wednesday night at the Cotton Bowl in the first College Football Playoff quarterfinal. ... That was a pretty cool moment,” said Scott, who has TD returns on both of his interceptions this season. 10 seed) have won two playoff games to get into football's final four after needing an at-large berth to make the 12-team field, after not even playing in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game. One more win and they will get to play for a national championship in their home stadium. Next for Miami in coach Mario Cristobal's fourth season is a CFP semifinal at the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 8 against No. There hasn't been a national title for “The U” since 2001, which was their fifth; Cristobal was a standout offensive tackle for the Hurricanes in their 1989 and 1991 championship seasons. “It is my obligation as a former Miami Hurricane player and all the things that Miami did for my brother and I to do my best to try to provide these guys with even better opportunities so they can fulfill all the great things they are destined for.” Before receiver Michael Irvin and coach Jimmy Johnson were Super Bowl champions with the Dallas Cowboys, they were part of the Hurricanes' 1987 national championship. Irvin excitedly ran down the sideline while Scott was scoring for a 14-0 lead, and Johnson was nearby when acknowledged by Cristobal during the on-field trophy presentation. 2 seed), which went into the game as a 9 1/2-point favorite according to BetMGM Sportsbook, that can't win back-to-back national titles for the first time in program history. The Buckeyes hadn't played since a 13-10 loss to now-No. 1 Indiana in a Big Ten championship game matchup of undefeated teams on Dec. 6. They still got a first-round bye, then lost just like all four teams that went directly to the quarterfinal round in the inaugural 12-team playoff last season. “We worked really hard during the last three weeks leading up to this game to come out of the gates and win the first quarter, win the first half, be ready to go,” Buckeyes coach Ryan Day said. “I think the guys bought into it. Scott's interception return came only 1:42 after Beck's quick pass to Mark Fletcher Jr. out of the backfield for a 9-yard score. Beck, who was part of Georgia's national titles in 2021 and 2022 when Stetson Bennett was the starter, completed 19 of 26 passes for 138 yards. When asked what stood out to him about these Hurricanes, Beck said, “Just the way that this team has responded to adversity. We knew coming into today that it wasn't going to be easy.” Sayin, a freshman backup behind Will Howard for Ohio State's championship run last season, was 22 of 35 for 287 yards with two interceptions and a TD to Jeremiah Smith. AP All-America receiver Smith, the Miami native, caught seven of those passes for 157 yards, including a 14-yard TD on a fourth down in the fourth quarter. Miami: The Hurricanes have won six games in a row since an overtime loss Nov. 1 at SMU, less than 25 miles from AT&T Stadium, where the Cotton Bowl is played. They also made their CFP debut in the Lone Star State, winning 10-3 at No. 7 Texas A&M in the first round on Dec. 20. Ohio State: All-America safety Caleb Downs, who started in the CFP for the third season in a row, became the first player to force two fumbles in a CFP game. Miami waits to see who it will play in the Fiesta Bowl.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. With nearly 9 million residents and the world's largest financial hub, New York City is about to test a progressive economic vision under Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Proposals such as free buses, city-owned grocery stores and rent freezes have already rattled Wall Street, prompting sharp criticism from Mamdani's critics. Affordability sits at the center of Mamdani's agenda as he prepares to run America's largest city. Here's a breakdown of how he plans to address it. Mamdani has proposed a network of city-owned grocery stores to address rising food prices. Mamdani has committed to creating a "network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit." The mayor of New York City has control over city-run programs, so he can accomplish this goal by securing New York City Council approval. Billionaire John Catsimatidis, owner of Gristedes and D'Agostino's, the largest independent supermarket chain in New York City, has previously said he would consider moving his corporate office out of New York following a Mamdani win. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is a state-run agency, so the mayor of New York City does not have direct control over it. Mamdani has vowed to "permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue-jump signals and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way." This proposal would require coordination with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). MTA is a state-run agency which the mayor of New York City does not have direct control over. According to City & State New York, Mamdani's free bus fare promise would require an additional expense, possibly more than $700 million. It's unclear how Mamdani plans to pay for the additional fee. Additionally, Mamdani has said he wants to raise the minimum wage to $30 an hour in the next four years. "After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases," Mamdani claims on his campaign website. By allowing the City Council to create its own minimum wage law, Mamdani has proposed a way to raise the minimum wage in New York City without the state's approval. It is unclear how Mamdani will finance this specific proposal of free childcare for New Yorkers. Mamdani has also campaigned to provide every New York family that has a child up to 5 years old with free childcare. It is unclear how he will finance this proposal, which experts estimate could cost billions of dollars annually. He has previously floated a tax increase on the wealthiest New Yorkers and corporations to pay for the increased services, which would require state-level approval. Mamdani has pledged to freeze rents for tenants in rent-stabilized apartments and expand affordable housing using city resources. While a rent freeze may sound like a straightforward fix to New York City's affordability crisis, housing experts warn it could backfire by discouraging investment and pushing rents higher in non-stabilized units. New York Apartment Association CEO Kenny Burgos said the policy could deter developers. "I don't know any investor or builder who would want to build in a city where the mayor is threatening to cap revenues," Burgos told FOX Business. Ed Elson, a business analyst and co-host of the "Prof G Markets" podcast, echoed that concern, saying rent freezes undermine supply. "Paradoxically, they disincentivize construction, which causes rents elsewhere to rise," he said, calling the policy "too good to be true." Mamdani has floated taxing the wealthiest New Yorkers to help finance some of his economic agenda. Mamdani said he would fund his programs through a "revenue plan" that would "raise the corporate tax rate to match New Jersey's 11.5%, bringing in $5 billion. Kathy Hochul has voiced her opposition to tax hikes, which could create some hurdles for Mamdani's marquee campaign promise. FOX Business' Daniella Genovese contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Walz (D-MN), whose administration is accused of allowing Somali fraudsters to target Minnesota's child care subsidies program, received nearly $10,000 in campaign contributions from supporters connected to Somali-operated day care centers. The Democratic donors involved in Somali day cares and home health services have written considerable checks to Walz's gubernatorial campaign, according to campaign finance filings compiled by the Washington Examiner. Like the Somali-run child care facilities highlighted by videographer Nick Shirley, these companies appear as legitimate businesses on paper, but upon closer inspection, some appear not to be operational. Walz's 2022 reelection campaign received $1,000 from Mohamed Rabi, of Hiawatha Adult Day Center Inc, which does not have its own website, for instance. Third-party sites operating out of New Jersey list the facility's address as Franklin Avenue, a crime hot spot in south Minneapolis. The adult day care center is supposedly housed within a run-down strip mall, occupying four commercial suites next to African Immigrants Community Services, a refugee resettlement program helping East Africans obtain public benefits. The state Department of Human Services previously cited the center for failing to provide patient records, including medical history, monthly progress reports, medication regimen, and notes on treatment. Yusuf Hassan, a business consultant, is listed as the center's chief executive officer. Hassan was also the director of Loving Arms Adult Daycare, another agency that lacked a discernible digital footprint and received payments through the state nutrition program. In 2021, Walz received a $1,000 campaign contribution from Khadar Jama, of Open Hearts Home Health Care, a Minneapolis-based at-home care provider that also lacks an independent website. That year, Best Care was also issued a correction order for repeatedly failing to develop individual abuse prevention plans as required and for failing to complete well-being assessments. One past Yelp review claimed that Best Care “seem[ed] more concerned about making money than doing a good job,” citing billing as the facility's top priority. In 2023, a judge found that Best Care improperly collected $2.23 million in Minnesota Health Care Program funds and ordered the organization to pay a penalty for the overpayments, which resulted from documentation errors. Best Care was previously accused in civil court of fraudulently billing or overcharging the federal government for healthcare services that were never actually performed. In a separate 2002 suit, the U.S. government lodged civil proceedings against Best Care for allegedly submitting fraudulent Medicare reimbursement claims. According to the complaint, Best Care, “by and through Khatoon,” billed Medicare on behalf of two other healthcare organizations that were not eligible for reimbursements themselves because they were not certified as Medicare providers, and agreed to split the payments. Abdullahi, a self-described “nationally recognized expert in cultural competency,” is the co-founder of several Minneapolis-area companies, including Midwest Career Institute, The Language Banc, and Pro-Health Home Care Agency, a home and community-based service eligible for Medicaid reimbursements. Pro-Health Home Care, sometimes stylized as Pro-Health Care Inc., supplies “culturally appropriate” caregivers outside of a hospital setting for post-discharge senior citizens and other incapacitated individuals. Aside from non-medical personal care assistants, an intake coordinator said that there are currently no skilled nurses available, as advertised, and recommended seeking private-duty nursing services elsewhere in Minnesota. Abdullahi had told the press that they have over 700 professionally trained caretakers, including licensed nurses, on hand. The Language Banc, which has since been acquired by Piedmont Global Language Solutions, purportedly had more than 1,000 contracted translators available around the clock to provide 24/7 interpretation services for communicating medical matters. However, one client review on the company's Yelp page warned, “Scammer, using unqualified or uneducated interpreters for medical interpreting. Neighboring a used car lot, the Language Banc was located inside a small building, now home to the newly shuttered Kids Care Center, a separate Somali-owned business that was fined for failing to perform proper background checks on its staff. Abdullahi's Language Banc took over the commercial space from Midwest Career Institute after the vocational school, which trained bilingual healthcare workers, dissolved following its brief operation. The companies combined produced a revenue of $6 million, Abdullahi told Twin Cities Business in 2013. In the video, Abdullahi explained to Kenyan viewers where Minneapolis is and “how to make it in business abroad as a foreigner.” The footage also featured photos of Abdullahi, a Hillary Clinton donor, posing for one-on-one pictures with the former Secretary of State and former President Bill Clinton. Local news outlets in Minneapolis have published similar stories touting Abdullahi's entrepreneurial success. Abdullahi unsuccessfully ran for governor of Wajir County in Kenya's 2022 gubernatorial races.</p>

Joel Klatt joins Colin Cowherd to ask if Miami can upset Ohio State, discuss Dante Moore and Oregon potentially struggling vs. Texas Tech, and if Fernando Mendoza can have a big game vs. Alabama. There was much debate a few weeks ago over whether the Miami Hurricanes belonged in the College Football Playoff, and on Wednesday night, they proved the naysayers wrong. Miami is the first double-digit seed to make it this far. Miami running back Mark Fletcher Jr., center, is tackled by Ohio State cornerback Devin Sanchez, right, during the first half of the Cotton Bowl College Football Playoff quarterfinal game Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025, in Arlington, Texas. Miami refused to be stopped on one of their final drives. Brown scored with 55 seconds left to deliver the final blow. Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin threw an interception on their final drive. The Hurricanes finally broke through in the second quarter when Beck faked a run and found Fletcher for a short pass. Fletcher ran the ball for a touchdown to go up 7-0 early. On the next drive, Keionte Scott picked off Sayin and returned the interception for a touchdown. Ohio State missed a field goal before halftime and Miami went to the locker room with a 14-0 lead. Jeremiah Smith #4 of the Ohio State Buckeyes attempts a catch in front of OJ Frederique Jr. #29 of the Miami Hurricanes in the second quarter during the 2025 College Football Playoff Quarterfinal at the 90th Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic at AT&T Stadium on Dec. 31, 2025 in Arlington, Texas. Sayin started the third quarter with an 11-play, 82-yard drive that took nearly seven minutes off the clock. It ended with a Bo Jackson touchdown. Ohio State followed up with a touchdown on a Jeremiah Smith catch on the next drive to cut the deficit to three points following a Miami field goal. Ohio State punted on its next drive and then turned the ball over on its final drive. He had 23 yards but made a few clutch plays with his feet. He was 19-of-26 through the air with 138 passing yards and a touchdown pass. Miami quarterback Carson Beck, right, prepares to hand off to running back Mark Fletcher Jr. during the first half of the Cotton Bowl College Football Playoff quarterfinal game against Ohio State Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025, in Arlington, Texas. Ohio State allowed more than 20 points in a game for the first time since their national championship win against Notre Dame back on Jan. 20. Sayin had two interceptions in the game and was sacked five times. Miami will play the winner of Georgia—Ole Miss.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China's efforts to reunify with Taiwan are “unstoppable,” Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in a New Year's address on Wednesday. The Chinese military recently conducted major military exercises near Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory; China hasn't ruled out military intervention to complete the reunification. Xi addressed the Chinese people in a nine-minute address on Wednesday night. “We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share a bond of blood and kinship,” he said. Taiwan condemned China's military exercises this week, which featured missile tests and the mobilization of navy vessels, aircraft, and other military armaments. “The Chinese Communist Party's aggressive and militaristic provocations endanger regional security and stability, and have been condemned by democratic allies in the international community,” Taiwan's defense department said in a statement. There are questions about whether China will launch military operations targeting Taiwan in 2026. “The coming year, 2026, will be a crucial one for Taiwan,” he said, adding Taiwan must “make plans for the worst, but hope for the best.” “We are willing to engage in exchanges and cooperation with China on an equal and dignified basis, promoting a peaceful and shared environment across the strait,” Lai said. “As long as China acknowledges the existence of the Republic of China, respects the Taiwanese people's desire for a democratic and free way of life.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago, Monday, Dec. 29, 2025, in Palm Beach, Fla. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Protesters stand off against California National Guard soldiers at the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles, during a “No Kings” protest, June 14, 2025. A protester confronts a line of U.S. National Guard members in the Metropolitan Detention Center of downtown Los Angeles, Sunday, June 8, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said he's dropping — for now — his push to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, a move that comes after legal roadblocks held up the effort. “We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!” he said in a social media post Wednesday. Governors typically control states' National Guardsmen, and Trump had deployed troops to all three cities against the wishes of state and local Democratic leaders. He said it was necessary as part of a broader crackdown on immigration, crime and protests. The president has made a crackdown on crime in cities a centerpiece of his second term — and has toyed with the idea of invoking the Insurrection Act to stop his opponents from using the courts to block his plans. He has said he sees his tough-on-crime approach as a winning political issue ahead of next year's midterm elections. Troops had already left Los Angeles after the president deployed them earlier this year as part of a broader crackdown on crime and immigration. When the Chicago deployment was challenged in court, a Justice Department lawyer said the Guard's mission would be to protect federal properties and government agents in the field, not “solving all of crime in Chicago.” Portland Mayor Keith Wilson's office in a statement said the city's reduction in crime was due to the efforts of local police and public safety programs. Trump's push to deploy the troops in Democrat-led cities has been met with legal challenges at nearly every turn. JB Pritzker wrote on X Wednesday that Trump “lost in court when Illinois stood up against his attempt to militarize American cities with the National Guard. Hundreds of troops from California and Oregon were deployed to Portland, but a federal judge barred them from going on the streets. Tina Kotek said in a statement Wednesday that her office had not yet received “official notification that the remaining federalized Oregon National Guard troops can return home. They were never lawfully deployed to Portland and there was no need for their presence. If President Trump has finally chosen to follow court orders and demobilize our troops, that's a big win for Oregonians and for the rule of law.” He deployed about 4,000 troops and 700 Marines to guard federal buildings and, later, to protest federal agents as they carried out immigration arrests. The number of troops slowly dwindled until just several hundred were left. They were removed from the streets by Dec. 15 after a lower court ruling that also ordered control to be returned to Gov. In a Tuesday court filing, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order. “About time (Trump) admitted defeat,” Newsom said in a social media post. “We've said it from day one: the federal takeover of California's National Guard is illegal.” Troops will remain on the ground in several other cities. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in December paused a lower court ruling that had called for an end to the deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., where they've been deployed since August after Trump declared a “crime emergency.” Trump also ordered the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis in September as part of a larger federal task force to combat crime, a move supported by the state's Republican Gov. In New Orleans, about 350 National Guard troops deployed by Trump arrived in the city's historic French Quarter on Tuesday and are set to stay through Mardi Gras to help with safety.</p>
