                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nationwide protests against living conditions enter fifth day with security forces reportedly using live ammunition The largest protests in Iran for three years entered a fifth day on Thursday amid reports of deadly clashes between protesters and security forces, with state-affiliated media confirming at least two people had been killed. Although state media did not identify those killed, witnesses and videos circulating on social media appear to show protesters lying motionless on the ground after security forces opened fire. The Oslo-based Hengaw Organisation for Human Rights said one of those killed had been struck by live ammunition and died before being taken to a medical facility. Activists and human rights groups have warned of an escalation in the response to the protests and say a brutal crackdown is under way as security forces continue to fire directly at protesters. An eyewitness in a message relayed to the Guardian said: “It's a battlefield here and they [security forces] are firing mercilessly.” Video footage shared on social media appears to show the use of gunfire by security forces against protesters as crowds run through smoke-filled streets and apparently injured people are carried away.' “Iranians are living below poverty lines in increasing numbers and have no hope [of] any notable improvement of their living conditions. That is why we see a pattern of popular outbursts and deadly crackdown.” The protests come after a year of a record number of executions in Iran, with more than 1,500 people put to death in 2025 – the highest number since 1989. “Executions are being carried out following grossly unfair trials held behind closed doors, amid widespread patterns of torture and forced confessions,” said Amnesty director Hussein Baoumi.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. Over a third of US states are set to raise their minimum hourly wage in 2026, but worker advocates including Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday decried a federal minimum wage that's remained at $7.25 since 2009 — and just $2.13 an hour for tipped workers for over three decades. Minimum wage hikes are set to go into effect in 19 states on Thursday: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. Three more states — Alaska, Florida, and Oregon — plus Washington, DC are scheduled to raise their minimum wages later in 2026. These include San Diego, California — where the minimum wage for hospitality workers is set to rise to $25 an hour by 2030 — and Portland, Maine, where all workers will earn at least $19 by 2028. However, the federal minimum wage remains at $7.25, and the subminimum rate for tipped workers is $2.13, where it's been since 1991 — and has lost more than half its purchasing power since then. No one who works full time should live in poverty. We must keep fighting to guarantee all workers a living wage — not starvation wages.” Yannet Lathrop, NELP's senior researcher and policy analyst, said earlier this month that “the upcoming minimum wage increases are incremental and won't magically turn severely underpaid jobs into living-wage jobs, but they do offer a bit of relief at a time when every dollar matters for people.” “The bigger picture is that raising the minimum wage is just one piece of a much larger fight for a good jobs economy rooted in living wages and good benefits for every working person,” Lathrop added. Numerous experts note that neither $7.25, nor even $15 an hour, is a livable wage anywhere in the United States. “The gap between wages and real living costs is stark,” OFW said. “According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, there is no county in the United States where a worker can afford to meet basic needs on less than $25 an hour. Even in the nation's least expensive counties, a worker with one child would need at least $33 an hour to cover essentials like rent, food, childcare, and transportation.” “Advocates argue that policies like President [Donald] Trump's ‘no tax on tips' proposal fail to address the underlying problem of poverty wages,” OFW continued. “While the policy has drawn attention, they say it is a headline rather than a solution, particularly since nearly two-thirds of tipped workers do not earn enough to owe federal income taxes.” Frustrated by the long-unchanged $7.25 federal minimum wage, numerous states in recent years have let voters give themselves raises via ballot initiatives. Such measures have been successful even in some red states, including Missouri and Nebraska. Rising minimum wages are a legacy of the union-backed #FightFor15 movement that began among striking fast-food workers in 2012. At least 20 states now have minimum wages of $15 or higher. However, back then, “the buying power of a $15 minimum wage was substantially higher than it is today,” EPI noted. Every Democratic and Independent upper chamber lawmaker voted in favor of the measure, while all Republicans except Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) As Trump administration and Republican policies and practices — such as passing healthcare legislation that does not include an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are set to expire on Wednesday and send premiums soaring — coupled with persistently high living costs squeeze workers, advocates say a living wage is more important than ever. The issue is underscored by glaring income and wealth inequality in the US, as well as a roughly 285:1 CEO to worker pay gap among S&P 500 companies last year. “Minimum wage doesn't cover the cost of living,” Janae van De Kerk, an organizer with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Airport Workers union and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport employee, said in a video posted Tuesday on social media. "Minimum wage doesn't cover the cost of living. Many of my co-workers have to choose between food on the table or health insurance" Janae, Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport service worker No one should have to make that choice. “Many of my co-workers have to choose between food on the table or health insurance, or the choice between having food and paying the electric bill,” van De Kerk — who advocates a $25 hourly minimum wage — continued. “We shouldn't have to worry about those things,” she added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trumpism has been aided by divestment that hollowed higher ed out from the core, AAUP President Todd Wolfson says. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. The United States is on the road to a form of neofascism that, if allowed to complete its course, will have long-lasting impacts on all aspects of society. Indeed, the Trump administration is carrying out a series of policies that target the very foundations of a free and open society — including an unrelenting assault on higher education and the U.S. education system in general. Higher education in particular seeks to nurture an environment that fosters independent thought, promotes thinking skills critical for democracy, and encourages inquisitive assessment of evidence for the purpose of promoting and disseminating the truth. At least, this has been the historical mission of universities, which is why they have always been targeted by reactionary forces with the intent of transforming them into pure ideological apparatuses of the fascist state. Following this pattern, Donald Trump has sought to bend universities to his will by cutting funding and forcing them to pledge support to his administration's initiatives for reshaping higher education by signing a Compact for Academic Excellence that basically erodes institutional independence. How successful has Trump's fascist takeover of higher education been so far? Wolfson is an associate professor of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University. C. J. Polychroniou: Trump's reactionary agenda has spread across all aspects of U.S. society, including politics, economics, societal norms, culture, and the environment. His culture war tactics extend to reshaping higher education, which he claimed in a recent Truth Social post “has lost its way, and is now corrupting our Youth and Society with WOKE, SOCIALIST, and ANTI-AMERICAN ideology.” Now, it is not common for U.S. presidents to dictate what colleges and universities teach and whom they hire, so Trump's assault on higher education is a clear indication that the country is descending into fascism. What sense do you make out of Trump's crackdown on higher education, which he has tried to justify mainly as a response to antisemitism on campuses? Is it just because he perceives universities as having become too liberal or progressive? Or is there some deeper motive behind his neofascist actions? Todd Wolfson: I would say that Trump's attack on higher education is being driven by a couple of different ideological and material forces. If we look at fascist Spain, fascist Italy, or Nazi Germany, or if we look at Victor Orbán's Hungary and his fascist or illiberal regime, what we see are three sectors that are clearly always identified and targeted. Higher ed is targeted because it's an independent political force that has a critical role in the ideological formation of society and poses a threat to fascist or authoritarian ideology. Another issue, in the American context, is that white voters — the Republican base — are more likely to vote Democrat if they go to college. So, in undermining college and making it so that less people attend, they are protecting their own ability to win elections. And a corollary, and this is in Project 2025, is the desire of some aspects of white nationalists to have higher birth rates in white communities in the U.S. Project 2025 outlines how white women with a college degree are likely to have less children than white women without a college degree, so once again, this plays into their white replacement theory. So I think all of those are reasons why the Trump administration has targeted and zeroed in on higher ed. And then there's things like the protests on Gaza. Historically, college campuses are places where students protest and build power and force societies to look at themselves in the mirror. Great social change often comes from the leadership of young people, so they're trying to crush dissent and campus protest, so that's another aspect of this. There are probably many other reasons as well, but I think those are some reasons why the Trump administration has zeroed in on higher education. It's also important to note that this agenda has been in the works for decades. In the '60s, Black Americans start getting broad access to free or highly subsidized public higher education, in particular the CUNY system in New York City and the University of California system were both free in the '60s, and people of color were getting access to that free higher ed. These movements were anchored and organized in many ways by college kids. So that happens in the '60s and fast forward, Ronald Reagan is running for a second term as governor in 1970 and he targets higher ed. He targets Berkeley, and his education advisor Roger A. Freeman says publicly, “We are in danger of producing an educated proletariat. So, this started in California and it started in response to who was going to college and what was happening on our college campuses. The last thing I'll say here is that it's not just Reagan. Lewis Powell became a Supreme Court justice in 1972, but before that he wrote the Powell memo for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and in that memo, he outlines why campuses are the biggest threat to a free market society and pressed for divestment, among other things. So the divestment from American higher education that has happened over the last half century was a political strategy from the right that led to a number of horrible outcomes, skyrocketing tuition, ballooning student debt, a near-complete reliance on contingent labor, and a growing army of bureaucrats that run our institutions more like businesses and less like higher education institutions. That divestment hollowed higher ed out from the core. It started from a right-wing position that has aided and embedded the fascist attacks on our institutions that we see today. How much federal funding do so-called private colleges and universities receive to the point that it makes them so vulnerable to government threats? I do think the attacks on funding and biomedical research have been unconstitutional, but not in the way you outline it here, because there is a role for federal governments to play in making sure that there's compliance with public and private institutions around core values. The Office of Civil Rights, which emerged on the heels of the civil rights movement, was put in place to make sure that racism did not take place on our campuses, and that grant programs and institutions adhered to a non-racist approach to higher education, and that there was a process in place for instances when they don't. When we talk about Trump going to the University of California or Harvard and threatening to freeze their money by alleging they have an antisemitism problem, I don't know if it's a constitutional problem in relationship to the power of the purse in Congress. It is a constitutional problem, as we've shown in court twice now, because it undermines our freedom of speech rights on our campuses. So, if you want to prove that there's an antisemitism problem and it's connected to a grant, you have to go through a process and you have to make a case, and they haven't done that at all, so we sued them twice. We won twice in court with the Harvard and University of California cases. Basically, our argument was that you cannot freeze grants that are doing research on cancer because you're making an unverified claim that there's rampant structural antisemitism at an institution, you must prove it. At UCLA, the Trump administration froze a billion dollars. (The University of California was cowardly and did not sue and is still negotiating with the Trump administration.) Combined, this represents over 100,000 workers, and we won that case. When people need to go see a doctor or have, say, Alzheimer's therapy, it's there because we fought to get the NIH grant that was funding the Alzheimer's lab and doing the research that your mother needed in order to get the therapy. So we were going to fight them on every inch here. Some universities have indeed capitulated to Trump's fascist demands for higher education, but there are a few that are balking at the idea of surrendering their independence. Can you give us an overall assessment of the way universities are responding to the Trump administration's war on higher education? Can you also explain why some of the nation's most powerful universities seem to have sworn oath to a wannabe dictator? Our universities and administrators have not covered themselves in glory during this moment. When universities stand up, it's usually because faculty, students, staff, unions and organizations that represent them, like the AAUP, have stood up first, and then they followed suit. Let's talk about the Trump administration's “loyalty oath” compact for higher ed. Billionaire Marc Rowan, CEO of Apollo Global Management Group, wrote a compact, or co-wrote it, that was the greatest threat to the autonomy of higher education in the history of this country. They then invited nine universities to join that compact. Two days after that compact became public, and we knew the nine universities that were invited, the AAUP, along with students groups like Students Rise Up, and some of our union partners, like AFT, organized meetings with members across the nine universities, and within a week, we were organizing actions and teach-ins on all nine campuses. What's important to emphasize here is that students, faculty, and staff, not administrators, stood up first and stood up most vehemently and forced administrators to respond to the Trump administration's attack on our autonomy. By early November, we had gotten seven of the universities to publicly reject the compact because of our organizing. So, no, I don't think there are many institutions standing up, including Harvard. Our broad coalition of students, faculty, and staff are leading this fight. We have not seen many of these administrators or presidents fighting back, in a way we need to see them fight back. Specifically, how is the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) challenging Trump's assault on academic freedom? Nothing else matters if we do not build an army of higher ed workers aligned with students to build power at the campus level, the state level and the federal level, not only to respond to Trump's attacks, but to also then pivot and go on the offensive and redefine higher education for this country. That's the first and primary area of work. The second area of work, as we already discussed, is legal. We sued the Trump administration about eight times. The third place we're fighting them is politically. What we've seen in this period is that we're the only ones that can actually set direction for our institutions. Higher education is critical to democracy, our economy, and our children's ability to get a leg up in this world. It appears, without a doubt, that Trump's actions have also laid bare the long-standing crisis in higher education in the United States, which is attributed to a very large degree to neoliberalism's policy agenda. Indeed, among other things, the implementation of neoliberal practices has paved the way to systematic privatization of public education, treating students as customers, and to a highly bureaucratic form of governance marked by top-down decision making that sidelines faculty. First, do you agree with this assessment of the state of U.S. higher education today and, second, what is, in your view, its future? I think we laid out our assessment of higher education previously so I'm not going to go back into it, but clearly, the neoliberalization and corporatization of the university is the fundamental crisis that's taken place in higher education over the last 60 years that has aided and embedded the fascist attack on higher ed that we're witnessing now from the Trump administration. “We need a free public higher education system, and we need that system rooted in dignity for the workers on our campuses.” Like almost every industrialized nation in the world right now, we want free public higher education. Kids should not have to go into debt to become the next teacher in our neighborhood school, or the next doctor or lawyer or any other number of important careers. We need a free public higher education system, and we need that system rooted in dignity for the workers on our campuses. We really need a higher ed system that's not just rooted in students as customers, but is rooted in critical inquiry and the development of smart, thoughtful citizens in a democracy who can see through the lies and stand up for the kind of society we want to build. That cannot happen without a strong, vibrant, free, autonomous higher ed system. Your one-time gift today will be matched immediately. This matching gift comes at a critical time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British charitable trust that draws on OxyContin-maker fortune says it exempted names to protect reputations Two charities that received a combined total of more than £1.1m from the British charitable trust run by the Sackler family were kept out of its latest accounts to protect their reputations from “serious prejudice”. The trust, which draws on the Sackler fortune that came out of the US opioid crisis, gave £3.8m to arts, eduction and science bodies in 2024, according to its latest accounts, filed on New Year's Eve. The largest named recipients – each receiving £250,000 – were Veterans Aid, which tackles homelessness in the ex-service community, and the Belvoir Cricket and Countryside Trust, which works to develop an appreciation for the British countryside and promotes a love of sport, especially cricket. The trust announced in 2019 it was pausing all new donations, but quietly resumed doing so in 2020. Its latest accounts, as has been the case in recent years, exempts the names of a number of entities receiving grants. Recipients who were named and who received £60,000 or more include Happy Day Ministries, Peterborough Asylum and Refugee Community Association, Waterlife Recovery Trust, Cliftonville Community Centre, Inside Job/Beating Time, Living Room, Mustard Tree and Not Beyond Redemption. Two recipients of grants – totalling £1,150,000 – were exempted from disclosure in the accounts filed to Companies House. The Sackler Trust continues to be chaired by Dame Theresa Sackler, a former trustee of the V&A who sat on the Purdue board from 1993-2018. She is the widow of Mortimer Sackler, one of the three brothers who ran Purdue Pharma. Dame Theresa's children – Michael, Marissa and Sophia – are trustees of the family charity, which has assets totalling £50m. While the Sacklers have donated millions over the years to charitable interests, some have accused them of using the giving of money as a means of “reputation laundering”. The Sackler Trust has been approached for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) faked the death of Denis Kapustin, commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK), and claimed the bounty placed on his head by Russia's intelligence service, HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov revealed on Jan. 1. "Welcome back to life," Budanov said on a Telegram video, while congratulating Kapustin and the intelligence team involved in the operation. The announcement follows reports published on Dec. 27 stating that Kapustin, also known by his nom de guerre "White Rex," had been killed during a combat mission in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. In its Jan. 1 statement, HUR said those reports were part of a complex special operation that misled Russian intelligence services. "First of all, Mr. Denis, congratulations on your return to life. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle," Budanov said. Kapustin said his temporary absence had not affected the unit's operations and confirmed his readiness to continue leading the Russian Volunteer Corps. "My temporary absence did not affect the quality or success of combat missions. Babchenko was revealed to be alive during a news conference in Kyiv, following a coordinated operation to collect evidence on the staged assassination after indications emerged that Russian operatives were planning a real attempt on his life.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to preliminary reports, over 24 people, including a child, were killed, and another 29 people, among them five kids, suffered injuries. Saldo said that three Ukrainian drones had hit a cafe and a hotel in Khorly in the Black Sea coast village of Khorly, where civilians were celebrating the New Year. The strike caused a fire that engulfed 500 square meters and was put out at 8:40 a.m. Moscow time (5:40 a.m. GMT), the governor's spokesman Vladimir Vasilenko told TASS. The Russian Investigative Committee launched a criminal investigation based on Article 205 of the Russian Criminal Code ("Terrorist Attack"), committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said. As many as 29 people were taken to the hospital, among them children born in 2008, 2012, 2018, and 2019, Vasilenko specified. Thirteen of those injured are hospitalized in Crimea and the Kherson Region. Six of them are in serious conciliation, Assistant Health Minister Alexey Kuznetsov told TASS. In fact, the crime can be compared to what happened in Odessa's Trade Union House," Saldo added, referring to the May 2, 2014 developments in the Ukrainian city of Odessa, where 48 people died in a fire set by radical nationalists. Russian Federation Council (upper house of parliament) Chair Valentina Matviyehnko stressed that the drone attack on the Kherson Region was only strengthening Russia's resolve to achieve the goals of its special military operation as soon as possible. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova pointed out that "those who sponsor the bastard terrorists in Ukraine" were primarily to blame for the attack on civilians in the Kherson Region. All countries "should make a proper legal and political assessment of this inhumane act" as "the killing of dozens of civilians cannot go unanswered," Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's Ambassador-at-Large tasked with overseeing the Kiev regime's crimes, emphasized. The Kiev regime ordered the Ukrainian army to attack civilians in such a brutal manner to revenge on them for choosing to live in Russia, a country free of Nazism, and speak their native Russian language, Viktor Vodolatsky, first deputy chair of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) Committee for CIS Affairs, Eurasian Integration and Relations with Compatriots, told TASS.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"For me, it is associated with the very warm evenings in May, the scent of lilacs and wildflowers. It is eternal youth and carelessness," she told the Kyiv Independent. "At the same time, it is an industrial city where thousands of miners and farmers work tirelessly." Once a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, it has become the focus of a long and bloody Russian offensive. Capturing Pokrovsk would give Russia a springboard toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, two of the largest remaining Ukrainian-held cities in Donetsk Oblast, and Ukraine has said more than 150,000 Russian troops are concentrated on this axis. Russian troops control most of Pokrovsk, including the center, and claim to have taken the city, but Ukrainian commanders say their forces have maintained control of its northern districts and recaptured around 16 square kilometers (9.9 square miles), even as months of Russian bombardment have left the city in ruins. All memories of my childhood seem like a dream, as if it never really happened and I made it all up," Harchevna said. "Russia destroyed not just residential buildings, but people's lives, hopes, and plans for the future." While the city is being destroyed by Russian forces, former residents of Pokrovsk look back on the years between 2014 and Russia's full-scale invasion to share their bittersweet memories about their city. Before the full-scale invasion, more than 60,000 people lived in Pokrovsk. It was a key Ukrainian logistics hub tucked away in what was then a relatively quiet part of Donetsk Oblast. Even after the full-scale war began, "people did their utmost to make the city better" amid regular missile attacks. After attacks, city workers were quick to make repairs, while doctors "did the impossible" to save and stabilize the wounded. Even as Russian forces approached, residents kept the streets clean and businesses running. "When the city was 17 kilometers from the front line, Ukrainian soldiers joked about the possibility of buying sweet strawberries, exotic fruits, and a dozen types of shrimp at a local market in winter," Polonska said. Polonska evacuated from Pokrovsk on Sept. 3, 2024, when it became unbearable to live there. Her thoughts, however, often return to the places she left behind. "My family had a dacha (summer house) near the Zelenivsky spoil tip, and I used to play there without even realising that one day I would be willing to give anything to see it again." Two months prior to the evacuation, her family buried a relative who was killed by a Russian missile at his workplace, an incident she describes as "the point of no return." "I lost a loved one because of the war, and I lost my home because of the war. And I can say that these feelings are very similar. "I come from a mining family; my father worked in the mines there for 30 years. I am very proud of Donbas because we knew how to work, how to earn money," Korkh said. Now her husband serves in the Ukrainian army. "Together with my husband, we had just built our dream house with solar panels, and now there is nothing left of it. He had a good job, was a skilled professional, and had the opportunity to avoid going to war. But after what happened in Pokrovsk, he decided to join the army." They also helped their neighbours and friends to relocate. It's great to have your own people around, a little easier emotionally." The hardest thing for Korkh is that she is not able to visit the graves of her relatives in Pokrovsk. It hurts me that I cannot visit her grave," she said. Before the active battles in the city, Pokrovsk was known among soldiers and volunteers as a meeting point and a place for rest. Oleksiy Nazarenko, a former infantryman of the 47th Separate Mechanised Brigade 'Magura,' spent some time recovering from combat injuries in Pokrovsk in 2023-2024. "Bulvar was a place where soldiers would meet, talk, eat, share news, and go on with their business. You could meet soldiers from different brigades there," Nazarenko said. The mall was hit and destroyed by a Russian strike in 2024. Architect, a drone operator who was fighting in the Pokrovsk direction, said that all the cities in that direction are dear to his heart. "There we, soldiers, leave behind our most turbulent years. Meetings, farewells, shawarma, and shitty coffee, packages from family at Nova Poshta, military stores, and tire repair shops with endless queues of cars. Every Christmas, she visited her grandparents, sang "Shchedryk" (Carol of the bells), and received candy in return. Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych lived and worked in Pokrovsk, where he, as some believe, completed his world-famous Christmas song. "In honor of this, there were plans to open the 'Shchedryk Park' cultural space, but unfortunately, this did not happen," Harchevna said. She last visited Pokrovsk in November 2023, trying to remember all her favorite places, which had already been damaged by Russian missiles. Hanna, 24, remembers places popular among local youth, such as Yuvileynyi Park and the main city square, where children and teenagers often gathered. "I really loved the main square, it was like a meeting place. The city wasn't very big, everyone knew each other. You could just go out for a walk, and an hour later, you'd be singing songs to guitar music with a group of people. But still, her favorite place was her home — a small brick house with a red wooden roof, with green leafy plants in the window. Hanna's father died when she was six years old, and the house was almost the only thing she had left of him, so it was very important to her emotionally. But after 24 Feb. 2022, I no longer feel protected anywhere. Now, with active fighting going on in the city, I feel as if a part of my soul has been torn away," Hanna said. She met Ukrainian soldiers in Dobropillia, from where Hanna picked her up. She still has fond memories of the time they spent together in her grandmother's house. "My most precious memories are definitely of how we always gathered at my grandmother's house for all the holidays, when the whole family was together. Now I don't even know if my uncle and his family are alive, as they didn't want to leave the city. Hanna's mother, Tetiana, spent nearly her entire life in Pokrovsk. Now she sees how Russia is destroying not just buildings, but her memories, "the places of youth, years of work, family moments." "Pokrovsk is a part of my biography," she added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has repeatedly stated that reunification with Taiwan is “inevitable,” reiterated the notion in his address to the nation on New Year's Eve, touting an unbreakable “bond of blood and kinship.” The reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable!,” Xi said on Wednesday, as cited by Xinhua. The Chinese leader also noted that Beijing would “support Hong Kong and Macao in better integrating into the overall development of our country and maintaining long-term prosperity and stability.” Beijing has repeatedly emphasized a preference for peaceful reunification, but has not ruled out the use of force should the island's “separatist forces” seek formal independence. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted two days of military drills around Taiwan this week, simulating a blockade of key ports, precision strikes on maritime targets, and scenarios to counter external interference. However, only a handful of countries maintain official diplomatic relations with Taipei, while most endorse Beijing. While the US government stated in 1979 that it “recognizes the Government of the [PRC] as the sole legal Government of China," it continues to maintain close ties with Taipei, which include visits by top lawmakers, and has repeatedly been reproached by Beijing. Russia's support for China with respect to Taiwan is enshrined in the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, which was signed between Moscow and Beijing in July 2001, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recalled in a recent interview, stressing that one of its basic principles is “mutual support in defending national unity and territorial integrity.” Lavrov said Taiwan is currently being used as a tool of “military-strategic deterrence” against Beijing, with some Western countries keen to profit from Taiwanese money and technology.
