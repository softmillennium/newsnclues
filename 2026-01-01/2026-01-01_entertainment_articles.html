                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Year's Day update on New Year's Eve business: 20th Century Studios/Disney's Avatar: Fire and Ash led what was a typical slow New Year's Eve, making $8.1M yesterday and taking its stateside cume to $250.2M. Worldwide, Avatar: Fire and Ash stands north of $860M; it's bound to become Disney's third 2025 theatrical release to cross $1 billion after Zootopia 2 and Lilo & Stitch. That running total is currently pacing -26% behind 2022's Avatar: Way of Water over the same span, 13 days, that sequel ending its run in North America at $684M (during its initial release, not counting re-release monies). Fire and Ash‘s 13-day cume is pacing -7% behind the original 2009 pic's total at the same point in time which was $268.8M (initial run's final theatrical was $749.9M). Walt Disney's 2025 Worldwide Box Office Clicks Past $6.5B; Co-Chairman Alan Bergman Says "It Showcases The Strength Of Storytelling" 'Avengers: Doomsday' Teaser: Marvel Drops Thor-Themed Sneak Peek, With God Of Thunder On Bended Knee Before Battle Note, by New Year's Eve, Avatar: Way of Water had been in theaters for 16 days. Way of Water‘s New Year's Eve total was $18M, while the original Avatar grossed $14.7M on that day. In the U.S./Canada, New Year's Eve always takes an ease before spiking today, which is similar trajectory to business on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. As such, all movies on New Year's Eve grossed around $28.7M, -38% from Tuesday's estimated $46.4M. Remember, the money made by Stranger Things: Finale, which began yesterday at 5PM EST and runs through today, is concession cash, not box office money. All we know is that two days before opening, 1.1 million seats were sold at 620-plus theaters stateside, which is 700K shy of the 1.7M tickets that Sony/Crunchyroll's Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had in the bank the Monday before it's opening Friday (why that comp?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are great songs throughout the history of pop music, including Bob Dylan's “Visions of Johanna” and Leonard Cohen's “Hallelujah,” where the imagery is so rich and dense that fans and critics have spent decades trying to decipher their true meanings. And then there's Taylor Swift‘s “Wood” where she compares a certain part of Travis Kelce's anatomy to a redwood tree and there's no other possible way to interpret it. And with just 10 minutes left in the year, Anderson Cooper attempted to get through a dramatic reading of the lyrics while a very tipsy Andy Cohen did his best to maintain a straight face. “Forgive me, it sounds cocky,” Cooper reads, as if coming across these words for the very first time. “He ah-matized me and opened my еyes.” The next part gave him a bit of pause, but Cohen urged him to keep going. “Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see/His love was thе key that opened my thighs.” That last word clearly left Cooper a bit stunned, but he soldiered on, “Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet, mm,” he read. If Cooper kept going, he would have read “a hard rock is on the way,” but he was simply unable to do it as millions of Americans looked on from their homes. He instead squealed with giggles like a small child, did his best to maintain his composure, repeated “I get it” a couple of times, and moved on with the evening. Cohen, meanwhile, couldn't remove a satisfied smirk from his face. From his perspective, this couldn't have gone better. In an interview with Jimmy Fallon, Swift insisted that the song was originally quite different. And it really started out in a very innocent place…I don't know what happened, man. “Do you feel cocky about the song?” Jason asked his brother. 'KPop Demon Hunters' Singers Deliver 'Golden' Performance at 'New Year's Rockin' Eve' Mariah Carey Brings Heat for New Year's Eve With Stellar 'Rockin'' Performance 4 Non Blondes Ignite 'Rockin' Eve' With Cathartic Anthem 'What's Up?' The same goes for Cooper, Cohen, and just about everyone else on the planet who listened to it even a single time. The sole exception may be Andrea Swift, who simply wouldn't allow herself to process lyrics that concerned her daughter and future son-in-law engaging in intimate relations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andy Cohen rang in the new year as he has done every year since 2017—alongside his close friend Anderson Cooper as co-host of CNN's live New Year's Eve broadcast. For New Year's Eve 2026, the Bravo host was in rare form as he chatted with guests and downed tequila shots while awaiting the countdown to the New Year. But while Cohen, 57, grew increasingly animated as the night went on, in the end, he closed things out by posting a poignant Instagram photo of him hugging Cooper as they stood on a platform in the middle of Times Square. “Happy New Year ❤️,” Cohen captioned the photo. Cohen and Cooper have been close friends for years. They both have kids around the same age and sometimes even vacation together, they shared during the CNN broadcast. Still, their personalities are very opposite, which is what can make watching them together so much fun. The duo's love for one another was apparent in Cohen's sweet New Year's photo. Fans reacted in the comment section “A friendship that anyone would love to have. Enjoy partying the night away!💕🥳” one fan wrote. Cupp also chimed in, writing, “YOU GUYS. During the live CNN broadcast, Cooper tried to calm Cohen down as he began to talk politics late in the evening. According to the New York Post, shortly after the ball drop, Cohen went off on outgoing NYC Mayor Eric Adams, and Cooper tried to cut him off—to no avail. Cohen accused Adams of having a “chaotic” and “horrible” four-year term and wished him to “go off in the sunset” to make way for incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani. Cooper put his arm around Cohen in an attempt to calm him down as he issued his passionate rant, the Post noted. Cohen previously found himself in hot water when he dissed former mayor Bill de Blasio during CNN's New Year's Eve 2022. He and Cooper were banned from drinking the following year on-air. Cohen offered no apologies for his 2022 political rant. The morning after, he wrote on Instagram, “I was a hair over-served last night, but man did I have fun! He later admitted on his Sirius XM show, “Andy Cohen Live”  that he regretted talking about Ryan Seacrest's rival New Year's Eve show. “The only thing that I regret saying, the only thing is that I slammed the ABC broadcast, and I really like Ryan Seacrest, and he's a great guy,” Cohen said in January 2022. Anderson's laughing, (giggling) was again, worth the watch! However Andy is always very inappropriate. Andy persona is dirty mouth and cool, but his home personality has gay overtones.be yourself all the time. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As in our previous prediction lists, we've focused on titles that have already started filming or are in post-production and which haven't yet been announced for a festival. There's always great interest in which studio movies could grace Cannes, Venice and other A-list festivals. We hear movies unlikely to debut on the Croisette, despite their early summer launch dates, include Steven Spielberg's UFO film Disclosure Day (June 12 launch) and Disney/Pixar sequel Toy Story 5 (June 19). Christopher Nolan's red-hot epic The Odyssey (July 17) is surely opening as a stand-alone summer blockbuster, with the director eschewing festival launches for many years. That leaves Cannes potentially short-handed in terms of major studio launches. But Thierry Frémaux often works magic, so let's see. There will still be plenty of high-profile pictures to choose from, as our list below reveals. Looking to the fall festivals, Alejandro González Iñárritu's newly titled Digger, starring Tom Cruise, looks possible for Venice, while Dune: Part Three has been dated for December 18, so seems to be removed from festival contention. There's also a question mark over Netflix's anticipated The Adventures of Cliff Booth. David Fincher is reportedly still filming into January so he'd have to go some to be ready for a summer release (which was reported in one trade), but we hear that Venice or another fall fest isn't off the table. Expectations are high for a premiere in Cannes, where Gray has already debuted five features including last film Armageddon Time. Producer Rodrigo Teixeira proclaimed to Deadline in December that Paper Tiger is Gray's best film ever. The large ensemble cast features Kirsten Dunst, Daniel Brühl, Keanu Reeves, Nicholas Braun, Samantha Morton and Tobias Menzies. Judith Godrèche rocked the French cinema world in 2024 with sexual abuse accusations against directors Benoît Jacquot and Jacques Doillon, turbo-charging France's MeToo movement in the process. She is now gearing up to unveil her feature directorial debut adapted from Nobel laureate Annie Ernaux's autobiographical novel. Valérie Dréville, Tess Barthélémy, Maïwène Barthélémy and Anna Mouglalis lead the ensemble cast bringing Ernaux's flashbacks to life as she reminisces during a book-signing trip that triggers memories of the pivotal summer of 1958. Godrèche, who has been a regular guest in Cannes as an actress, hit the festival as a director in 2023 with short film Moi Aussi. After a lengthy break, Oscar-winning Polish filmmaker Paweł Pawlikowski is back with this Cold War drama co-starring Hanns Zischler and Sandra Hüller as writer Thomas Mann and his daughter Erika, an actress, journalist and rally driver. After Tahiti-set Pacification and bullfighting doc Afternoons of Solitude, Cannes and San Sebastian regular Albert Serra delves into geopolitics with this tale of an American delegation on a mission to Russia during the Ukrainian war. Riley Keough features in the cast alongside F. Murray Abraham, Evgeniya Gromova and Liza Yankovskaia. First revealed by Deadline in June, Netflix's film continues the story of Brad Pitt's character from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. David Fincher directs, with Quentin Tarantino's blessing and the latter's script. Also in the cast are Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Elizabeth Debicki, Carla Gugino and Scott Caan. Netflix always has a healthy contingent on the Lido. Warner Bros and Legendary's new Tom Cruise movie directed by four-time Oscar winner Alejandro González Iñárritu has newly been titled Digger and will hit theaters on October 2, 2026 — that's the prized frame where Warner Bros/DC's Joker bowed in 2019 after world premiering in Venice. Austrian director Marie Kreutzer won acclaim for historical drama Corsage, starring Vicky Krieps as Empress Elisabeth of Austria, or Sisi, which played in Un Certain Regard in 2022 and was then Austria's Oscar entry. Her new drama stars Léa Seydoux as a renowned pianist who relocates with her family to the countryside and then uncovers a life-shattering truth that forces her to confront the complexities of love and trust. The cast also features Jella Haase (Chantal in Fairyland), Laurence Rupp (Veni, Vidi, Vici) and Catherine Deneuve. Rosalind Eleazar (Slow Horses) stars as talented actress Misty Green, who is attempting to re-set a career derailed by her vices in this original feature written and directed by Chris Rock. The stand-up and actor also appears in the role of film director Jordan, who offers Misty a role that would be perfect for her if it were not for their contentious past. The cast also features Adam Driver, Daniel Kaluuya and Anna Kendrick. Iranian director Asghar Farhadi returns to France for a second time after 2013 couple drama The Past. His new French-language drama gathers a high-profile ensemble cast topped by Isabelle Huppert, Virginie Efira, Vincent Cassel, Pierre Niney and Adam Bessa, with Catherine Deneuve also putting in a brief appearance. Farhadi, who won Oscars for his Iran-set features A Separation (2012) and The Salesman (2018,) vowed in 2024 that he would no longer make films at home until the country's Islamic Republic government lifts draconian rules around women's rights and attire. Romanian director Cristian Mungiu's English-language debut co-stars Sebastian Stan (The Apprentice) and Renate Reinsve (Sentimental Value) as a Romanian and Norwegian couple whose plans for a new life in the wife's native fjord village come up against neighbors with a very different outlook on life. Hungarian director Kornél Mundruczó's Hollywood currency rose in 2020 with English-language debut Pieces of a Woman after Vanessa Kirby was Oscar-nominated for her performance. It remains to be seen whether Amy Adams will enjoy a similar trajectory as the star of his latest movie about a woman who takes refuge in her family's beach home after a major life setback. Mundruczó is set for a high-profile 2026 with a second film, Place to Be, starring Ellen Burstyn and Taika Waititi, also currently in post-production. A Family Carice van Houten, Pieter Embrechts and rising young talents Celeste Holsheimer and Finn Vogels co-star in this intimate Dutch-language portrait of two siblings caught in the emotional crossfire of their parents' divorce, unfolding their story from mirrored perspectives as they navigate loyalty, heartbreak and the fragile path back to love. Indigenous Australian filmmaker Warwick Thornton's new movie is billed as a period Western set on the 1930s colonial frontier. It follows three Aboriginal children who escape brutal servitude in the wolfram mines and embark on a dangerous journey across Central Australia in search of safety and a future they can call their own. Juno and Superbad star Michael Cera makes his feature directorial debut with this absurdist comedy exploring modern loneliness and the search for connection. Deadline is told it could be ready in time for a 2026 festival splash. A regular on the festival circuit with her short films which include Chopping Onions, Cheer Up Baby and Moving, New York-based filmmaker Adinah Dancyger taps into her Korean and Polish roots for this debut feature revolving around an unlikely bond forged between a Korean deli owner and a Polish-Jewish artist in her home city in the 1980s and continued against the odds across decades. Other cast include Chiara Mastroianni, Emmanuelle Devos and Carole Bouquet. Provost, whose credits include Séraphine, The Midwife and How to Be a Good Wife, was last in Cannes in 2023 with artist biopic Bonnard, Pierre & Marthe. Riding high on the reception for All of Us Strangers, Andrew Haigh has gathered one of his buzziest casts to date — featuring Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), Caitriona Balfe (The Amateur), Fred Hechinger (Marty Supreme), Kit Connor (Warfare), and D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai (Caught Stealing) — for this mountain-set tale of a family preparing for a long winter ahead, against a backdrop of absence and regret. Adapted from the eponymous novella by Colm Tóibín (Brooklyn, Return to Montauk), the drama began filming last October and hopes are high that it will be ready for a 2026 festival splash. Further cast members include Camille Cottin, Benjamin Lavernhe and Noémie Merlant. Javier Bardem stars as an acclaimed film director who reunites with his unsuccessful actress daughter on a movie after years of estrangement in Spanish director Rodrigo Sorogoyen's first movie in four years. Indonesia director Kamila Andini's sixth feature revolves around a woman who returns home after spending more than a decade in prison for killing the man who raped her. Finding herself unwelcome and marginalized, she unites with other outcasts as she reconciles with her past and carves out a new life. Andini has shown nearly all her films at the Berlinale, with her last feature Before, Now & Then premiering in competition in 2022. In between times, she made the award-winning Netflix show Cigarette Girl. Callum Turner and Riley Keough top the cast of Karim Aïnouz's remake of Marco Bellochio's 1965 satirical drama about family dysfunction feature Fists in the Pocket. Aïnouz is directing script written by longtime Yorgos Lathimos collobrator Efthimis Filippou. Brazilian and Algerian filmmaker Aïnouz's last three films — Motel Destino, Firebrand and The Invisible Life of Euridice Gusmao — all debuted in Cannes. Spanish duo Javier Calvo and Javier Ambrossi, who are known collectively as Los Javos, first made waves with genre-bending thriller La Mesias. Their second feature is based on an unfinished play by Federico García Lorca and revolves around the interconnected stories of three men across three different eras. A Day In The Life Of Jo: Chapter PhaedraGreek director Jacqueline Lentzou's second feature takes its cue from the unexpected death of a teenager in Athens, whose light does not go out. Lentzou previously made waves with 2021 first feature Moon, 66 Questions, which premiered in Berlin's Encounters section. FleurFrench animation director Rémi Chayé's last film Calamity, a Childhood of Martha Jane Cannary won Best Film at the Annecy International Animation Festival in 2020. Çatak shot the film in secret and has been in post-production since then and is expected to hit the festival circuit this year The film follows a married actress and a professor of dramatic arts at the university in Ankara, whose lives are sent into a tailspin when they both lose their jobs due to “state arbitrariness”. Guy Pearce plays Murdoch opposite Jack O'Connell as so-called tabloid king Albert “Larry” Lamb, the Yorkshire native hired to spearhead the newspaper's transformation. Boyle has debuted multiple films at festivals but not all. Bitter ChristmasAfter winning the Golden Lion in Venice with The Room Next Door, legendary Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar got straight back to work with Bitter Christmas, a film about a woman who is abandoned by her partner during Christmas time. The film is set for a March 20 launch in Spain, so could play Berlin and would be a significant coup for Berlin head Tricia Tuttle, although the Spanish release does not exclude it from a Cannes release. CowardSet in World War One, Belgian filmmaker Lukas Dhont's latest feature follows soldiers trying to keep up their morale in the trenches. Stirred by wartime rhetoric, each of them seeks their own path. Dhont was last at the festival in 2022 with Close, which debuted in competition and was then Oscar nominated as Belgium's entry that year. Dated for release in France on June 10 and July 3, 2026, we would not be surprised to see at least the first part play Out of Competition in Cannes. The drama is loosely based on published letters written by late philosopher Makiko Miyano in the wake of her diagnosis with breast cancer. It Will Happen Tonight Louis Garrel and Jasmine Trinca co-star in Italian director Nanni Moretti's romance unfolding in Rome, Turin, San Sebastian among other locations. The film is adapted from short story Hungry Heart by Israeli author Eshkol Nevo, whose work previously inspired Moretti's 2021 film Three Floors Up. Cannes would be an obvious berth for Moretti, who has debuted 11 films at the festival, beginning with Ecce Bombo in 1978, and including Dear Diary, for which he won best director in 1993, and Palme d'Or-winning The Son's Room in 2001. After a series of award-winning shorts including Auschwitz on My Mind and Seven Minutes, Israeli director Assaf Machnes makes his feature debut with this timely Berlin-set drama about a series of encounters between a reserved 55-year-old Palestinian Uber driver and a young, outspoken Israeli, who keeps getting lost in the city. Principal photography began in September 2025, with filming taking place across multiple Bavarian and Franconian locations, as well as at the newly established Penzing Studios in Munich. Garfield is joined in the cast by Jamie Bell and Thomasin McKenzie among others. As the villagers turn against their budding friendship, Kellou must stand up for Aya and face the hostility of her own people, while fighting to hold on to her freedom. Garfield is joined in the cast by Yura Borisov, Monica Barbaro, Jason Schwartzman, Cooper Hoffman, Ike Barinholtz, Cooper Koch, Billie Lourd, Zosia Mamet, and Chris O'Dowd among others. Jesse Eisenberg Untitled MusicalJesse Eisenberg planted his flag as a serious director with 2024's A Real Pain, which won an Oscar after its Sundance debut. He returns to director's chair with this untitled musical project starring Julianne Moore and Paul Giamatti. However, production began in early 2025, so the film is theoretically prime for a 2026 debut.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over his own three decade career representing the district in Congress, retiring Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) was never elected with anything less than 75 percent of the vote. Liam Elkind, a Rhodes scholar and co-founder of the nonprofit Invisible Hands, portrayed Nadler as an emblem of an aging, enfeebled Democratic party, full of geriatrics who stubbornly refuse to give up power before it's too late. Losing our democracy,” he said in his campaign launch video. A crush of political hopefuls are now queuing up for the chace to fill Nadler's seat: With half a year to go before the June primary, the field is crowded with activists, advocates, influencers, and local pols. How much influence will tech billionaire cash exert on the electorate? Does the Kennedy name still carry any sway in Democratic politics? One thing is clear: A current of frustration and disappointment with the Democratic Party runs through many of the candidates' campaign launch videos. Lawyer and victims rights advocate Laura Dunn declares: “We deserve better than Democratic leaders who've been profiting off their position while you and I struggle to make ends meet… better than wishy-washy centrists who are allowing the roll back of our rights and liberties.” Cameron Kasky, a survivor of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida says, “We need leaders who aren't going to coddle their billionaire donors, who won't support a genocide, and who aren't going to settle for flaccid incrementalism.” An operator active in New York politics since his teenage years, Lasher has already racked up the official backing of a profusion of local officials — and at least one former rival: Elkind threw his support behind the assemblymember when he bowed out of the race in December. Bores was the co-author of the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark piece of legislation that will place new guardrails on large AI firms. For his temerity, a pro-AI PAC with $100 million at its disposal has declared its intention to spend lavishly against Bores — a campaign that it has already begun. Kim Petras Offers to Send Zohran Mamdani Her New Album if He Does One Thing for NYC 'SNL' Weekend Update Roasts Andrew Cuomo's Failed Campaign, 'Suspicious' RFK Jr. (A third local politician who was vying for Nadler's seat, City Councilman Erik Bottcher, dropped out of the race in late December, opting to seek a state senate seat instead.) But voters eager for fresh blood will have no shortage of newcomers to choose from, including two social media stars minted in the Trump era: Jack Schlossberg, the 32-year-old grandson of John F. Kennedy who gained a following for his offbeat Instagram presence (which often skewers his cousin, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.) and George Conway, 62, the former Republican once married to Trump's 2016 campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. A lawyer who worked on the Clinton impeachment before he became an outspoken Trump critic, Conway's candidacy will test whether voters in this historically liberal district are willing cast their lots in with an anti-Trump crusader who still self-describes as a conservative. “These people who follow the orange Jesus are not conservatives — they're nihilists.”) A trio of well-known advocates have also thrown their hats in the ring: Kasky, Dunn, and Mathew Shurka. Shurka, 37, is a gay man who spent years in conversion therapy as a teenager before going on to become an outspoken champion of laws banning the practice. Kasky, 25, co-founded the gun violence prevention group March for Our Lives after his classmates were gunned down by a former student in Parkland. “I do not understand how people can be horrified by the shootings in our high schools, but think that these children and adults being slaughtered in Gaza is any different. A survivor of sexual assault as a college student, Dunn, 40, became a lawyer with practice centered on Title IX claims — sex-based discrimination on college campuses — before, she says, Trump made it functionally impossible for victims to pursue such claims in his first term. Dunn was part of a group of advocates who worked to rewrite Title IX regulations during the Biden administration, but Biden delayed implementing them until it was too late. “Now there's legal battles around it, but I'm skeptical that we will revive them,” Dunn says. “I am very upset by the Democratic Party playing with sexual assault as a political football.” 'KPop Demon Hunters' Singers Deliver 'Golden' Performance at 'New Year's Rockin' Eve' Mariah Carey Brings Heat for New Year's Eve With Stellar 'Rockin'' Performance Rounding out the field is Alan Pardee, 58, a former managing director at Merill Lynch. With three months to go before the April 2 filing deadline, the race is still wide open and there is still time for even more entrants, with their own visions for and grievances against the Democratic Party to step forward.</p>

Melania Trump rang in the new year alongside husband Donald at a glitzy Mar-a-Lago party Wednesday night, dressed in a silver sequined gown ($1,450) by The New Arrivals.

Along with the shimmering metallic maxi, which she cinched at the waist with a matching belt, the first lady  selected a pair of glittering Christian Louboutin heels.

She wore her highlighted hair parted in the center and arranged in soft, flowing waves for the NYE soirée, where a tuxedoed President Trump — asked by reporters about his 2026 resolution — called for “peace on earth.”

Others in attendance at the Trumps' party included Brett Ratner — the director behind “Melania,” the upcoming Amazon MGM Studios documentary about the first lady.

US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also scored invites.

And Trump's children Donald Jr., Barron and Eric joined as well, with the latter's wife, Lara, dressed in a rose gold sequined gown that coordinated with Melania's.

Mar-a-Lago's New Year's Eve bash is a longstanding tradition of the family's that dates back decades.

In the past — before President Trump's time in the White House — the star-studded shindig's drawn guests including Sylvester Stallone, Tiger Woods, Martha Stewart and Serena Williams.

At last year's event, held just a few weeks before Trump's second inauguration, Melania chose a classic black Versace gown featuring the house's signature gold Medusa hardware at the shoulder.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sam Rosenberg's monthly column CineMusic highlights newly released film scores, soundtracks, and the composers/curators behind them. Despite being set in 1952 New York, Josh Safdie's Marty Supreme isn't your typical period piece film. The sports drama follows the trials and tribulations of Marty Mauser, a young and stubborn ping-pong maestro played by Timothée Chalamet, whose single-minded pursuit of greatness is soundtracked by a series of ‘80s needle drops and a riveting, cosmic score by Daniel Lopatin, best known by his stage name Oneohtrix Point Never. The movie marks the third collaboration between Lopatin and Safdie, but it might just be their most emotionally epic one yet. Much like his OPN records and scores for Safdie's other pictures, 2017's Good Time and 2019's Uncut Gems, Lopatin's work on Marty Supreme draws heavily from the shimmering electronic sounds of ‘80s new wave. All the trademarks are there: propulsive percussion, operatic choirs, fluttery flutes, sci-fi/horror-adjacent synths and organs. The sonic anachronisms might catch people off-guard—the Peter Gabriel, Alphaville, and Public Image Ltd. needle drops certainly did for me—but it's a mostly effective (and definitely entertaining) method that captures the friction between Marty's eager ambition to be the best and the many existential, professional, and financial obstacles he's up against in doing so. Over Zoom, I spoke with Lopatin about his score, how Tears for Fears served as major inspiration, his longtime collaborative relationship with Josh Safdie, his favorite pieces from Marty Supreme, and his love for composer Thomas Newman. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Paste Magazine: To start, I would love to hear about how you first conceptualized the score. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you mentioned in the Q&A after a screening I attended that you were influenced by the Tangerine Dream score for Risky Business and the John Williams score for E.T. Daniel Lopatin: Those were touchstones, but they didn't inspire the score initially. The original ending in the script that was altered—and that you don't see in the film—has Marty Mauser at a Tears for Fears concert in ‘84 or ‘85 with his kids. There's some indication, at least from the way I interpreted reading the script, that he might be reflecting on how he arrived at that point in his life and that's what you've been watching on screen. The idea that the music runs concurrently with this memory interested me a lot, in the sense that when you're trying to do two things at once, it doesn't really work out that well. I gave myself artistic license to think of the score as an abstraction of this Tears for Fears concert. But the other thing that unlocked it for me was just sitting in my first spotting session with Josh [Safdie], closing my eyes for the second viewing, and listening to the sport of table tennis itself and linking that to Marty Mauser's essence in his buoyancy, his excitement, his aggression, his speed, and getting into sounds that have a formal register that speaks to the game itself. And then, beyond that, realizing that there's a lot of interesting mallet strikes in the ‘80s new wave music—they were so into sampling real, organic instruments, because it was the first time they could. So everything came together in this crazy cyclone of ideas that were really perfectly linked with one another in a way that made scoring it really fun and really easy. I'm curious if there were any reservations about doing something that was a bit more anachronistic, or if that was kind of always the plan. It was pretty much always the plan to have those needle drops. It is really ‘80s, but there's also Laraaji playing zither and percussion. You could say that we might have more reservations about doing things “the correct way” and honoring the period than we would have reservations about doing something the interesting way, which is how we did it. To me, it would be just another boring period piece. You've worked with Josh before on Good Time and Uncut Gems. What draws you to working with him? Were there any big differences in scoring this film versus the others or have the processes working on each film all been relatively similar? Ten years is a long chunk of life. When we met each other, we were Marty Mausers trying to teach each other about how we were defining music departments on films for ourselves. He had made a few and I had some experience scoring a couple, but we were both really ambitiously—and excitedly—looking to one another. It's like an art project: How are we going to define our working relationship and how are we gonna make something that is us? Time is the secret ingredient of life. I don't think I could sum it up in any way, but I think when you're in the soup with somebody artistically, in the foxhole working on projects together over a long period of time, you develop a shorthand. You learn a lot from mix engineers. You learn a lot from other films. It's been one of the greatest gifts of my life to have a long-term artistic collaboration. Josh helped out with the score as well. He just can't help but get involved in all aspects of his film. That's what makes these films so wonderfully focused and unique at the same time. You're just like, “These are Josh Safdie pictures.” He's in there conducting, basically. He's showing me with his body like a conductor what's up. He has just a lot of courage and belief in his instincts. No matter how little or how much he knows about a particular musical challenge that we're facing, he finds a way to describe it to me, often with his arms. Do you have a personal relationship to or philosophy around the themes explored in Marty Supreme? I don't know how it shaped it, but it helped me understand the film and once you understand the film, I think you're just in a better psychological position to make good work. Anyone who has dealt with ideas around integrity in their line of work, or the idea of a calling or the idea of your vocation versus your calling or these types of ideas, I think they'll get something from this film. That's one of the subtextual things about this film. It's about artistic integrity, or integrity more broadly, but we're aware of artists, so I guess we're thinking about things that way. When do you stick your neck out? Also, just the idea of a young Jewish guy for whom his community doesn't really want much more than the next guy. It's a factor of growing up in a largely immigrant background, where so much is at stake and so much is centered around the ideas of survival and in a way conformity. But as often as young people find themselves at that point in life, why would we listen to a bunch of old people telling us what we should be? We don't want to be something that's established. It's so easy for me to sink my teeth into this one. Something like Uncut Gems was a little bit more of an analytical approach, where this one was just a little more like, yeah, this is in my blood. Is there a particular part of the score that you loved composing? Or did it all flow once you nailed the concept? I don't know how to single out any of my little babies, although I think there's some cues that are pretty dazzling. And I like “I Love You, Tokyo,” which is, at its core, almost a very simple European melody that my dad would play all the time at home on piano. It was interesting to see how much of his musical language was passed down to me. She was a pretty incredible New Age composer. She worked primarily in the ‘70s and ‘80s, making these New Age records, but they were so much more than just New Age records. It's an interesting piece because, when it really starts ramping up, it's Marty and Kay (Gwyneth Paltrow) circling each other and sizing each other up for the sex scene. You also put out a great album this past year, Tranquilizer. Were you working on that while doing Marty Supreme, or did you get a chance to work on them with enough separation? I started doing research on Marty towards the end of Tranquilizer. They were right up against each other, spring and summer. How do you manage separating your work as a film composer versus as a solo artist? I figure it's a slightly different experience, in the sense that you're making something for someone else as a composer and something for yourself as a solo artist, but I'm curious if there's any overlap between the two, in terms of your approach. I think I borrowed some of the more logistical aspects of scoring films over to my own stuff because, without some self-imposed restrictions and deadlines, you can really get into this megalomaniacal state of mind with your own music—where it just goes on and on and you keep tinkering and you say, “Who is it for?” Maybe I've improved on that anyway, but I think knowing Marty was around the corner put the fire under my butt to be like, “You gotta set some really firm deadlines here and commit to some stuff.” I really love that about Tranquilizer, that there's this kind of incredible urgency to it. It was also just really fun to make and once I unlocked the process of Tranquilizer, it didn't feel like a job or anything. Everything for any project, whether it's for other people or for me, locks into place once I know why I'm making the thing, what the soul of the thing is. And without the point of view, I don't have anything and no deadline can help me. I got really, really lucky this year with Tranquilizer and Marty, because both projects were coming from that place. You have a reason for doing this stuff. Any film scores or composers you love that have inspired or influenced you in some way—not just with this project, but in general? I talk a lot about Thomas Newman, because he was someone I had a vague awareness of but got really, really into last winter when I watched Angels in America for the first time. My girlfriend showed me Angels in America and I was basically sobbing for two days straight. I got obsessed with Thomas Newman after that. I know his brother David because we worked briefly together. Tell me everything.” And he's like, “All right, you gotta go check out the Desperately Seeking Susan score.” You gotta do this, you gotta do that. He's been a big influence over the last year or so. I think he's also an unheralded genius of film score. The way I like to put it about Thomas Newman is that no composer has singlehandedly nailed the vibe of wonder or curiosity or the gentle intrigue about what the hell is going on around you. I think he's a kind of total genius. His brother David too, who doesn't get a lot of airtime in the conversations about great film composers. I like Carter Burwell, the longtime Coen Brothers composer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Dancing with the Stars” co-host Julianne Hough has a new gig that is reuniting her with one of her exes … well, kind of! Hough will be cohosting “Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest 2026.” She will be co-hosting with NFL star Rob Gronkowski. As audiences get ready to watch the show, we are also taking a look at Hough's past relationships and her current relationship status. “I don't really have a type. She continued, “I'm always looking for love, whether it's in a romantic sense or friends. “What is more fun and screams celebration than Vegas?” she said. The performances, the lineup—it's pretty spectacular.” She also discussed working with Gronkowski, saying, “I just said to him, ‘I feel like we should do some fun dance TikToks. Hough has had several high-profile relationships, including with Seacrest. I'm very blessed, and I don't take anything for granted,” she told Parade of her relationship with Seacrest in 2012. “I think if you alienate people and just focus on your work then it just becomes lonely and it's not fun anymore.” Before Seacrest, she was engaged to Zack Wilson. In an interview with Glamor, she reflected on the relationship, saying, “When I first came to L.A. … I was engaged to someone else, a guy I knew from Utah who had served a Mormon mission.” In 2008, she dated country music singer Chuck Wicks, and the couple even appeared on DWTS together. They danced together on Season 8 and were eliminated in Week 8. In 2013, Hough started dating former hockey player Brooks Laich. “We share an abundance of love and respect for one another and will continue to lead with our hearts from that place.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Formally, he's addressing Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower), the little boy who grew up to be the big monster that brought so much fear and pain to the families of Hawkins, Indiana. But Will may as well be speaking on behalf of any character in a coming-of-age story. That's their goal, after all: to leave the relatively comfortable confines of childhood and embrace their uncertain, oft-terrifying future as adults. Related Stories It's Going to Be a While Before ‘Pluribus' Season 2, Says Vince Gilligan A Simple Plan to Save ‘Stranger Things' from Hollywood's Tired Franchise Trap For all the talk around who would die and what was really going on with the Upside Down, growing up was always Matt and Ross Duffer's ultimate endgame. From the start, “Stranger Things” was a coming-of-age story. Even the adult leads, like Hopper (David Harbour), were struggling with some form of arrested development. So as the finale plays out beat by predictable beat — preparing for the decisive showdown (climb those ladders, kids! ), suffering an unexpected, seemingly insurmountable setback (Hopper really should've known better than to fall for Vecna's tricks), then rallying to trounce the villain (with teamwork!) before returning home for a quick peek at where everyone ends up (Coach Steve!) That doesn't make it surprising — far from it — and the frustrations don't stop with getting exactly what's expected. But there's fulfillment to be found in a story resolving as it should, even if that means it lacks the edge to be remembered in the days, weeks, and years to come. Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) being the only major death isn't a problem (although I'm sure it will be for viewers with a stronger bloodlust), but her arc in Season 5 is still an unforced error. To be honest, I didn't even remember who Kali was when she reappeared at the end of Episode 4 (“Sorcerer”), and even those who did likely weren't excited to see her. Then she's saddled with the noxious task of trying to convince Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) to kill herself for the greater good, only to reverse course at the last second and save her? It didn't have to go down like this. Was Kali so reviled that she had to be revived, slapped with a torturous backstory to fill in the gaps since she left, and then shot by a loathsome soldier? It's just not a good look, and worse yet, it's emotionally hollow (unless you count anger over a little brown girl being sacrificed in order to save a little white girl). Elsewhere, the finale lost its footing when Vecna meets his ultimate end. After toying with the idea that Henry was just the Mind Flayer's victim all along — poisoned by a mysterious rock he found after killing the scientist as a boy — Vecna rejects Will's pleas to switch sides and then promptly gets his ass kicked. This half-hearted nod to a tragic origin story feels like it's only included to make people who forked over hundreds of dollars to see the Broadway show feel better about their choices, but it's not where Episode 8 goes wonky. “Stranger Things” isn't averse to the F-word. Per the Reddit forums, Will said it back in Season 3, and various other characters have dropped a muted or bleeped “fuck” or two. But Joyce (Winona Ryder) walking up to Vecna's crucified body and quipping, “You fucked with the wrong family” still feels forced — and that's before she proceeds to hack away at his thick, vine-y neck until his head thumps to the ground. Joyce may as well have curb-stomped Vecna, Derek Vinyard-style — it would've had the same appalling effect and lasted half as long. Without the quick cuts to all the past anguish Vecna caused everyone unlucky enough to observe Joyce's butchery, I would've assumed they were disgusted by her over-the-top attack. But hey, maybe that's just me — again, I'm not watching “Stranger Things” with Drowning Pool cued up, waiting for the bodies to start dropping. If anything, I was waiting for the coda. Knowing (or assuming to know) “Stranger Things” wouldn't end in a bloodbath, what happens after the boss battle becomes the most compelling question. What's in their immediate future, and would the series jump ahead to tell us, say, just how many kids Steve has, or whether Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Max (Sadie Sink) get married? Thankfully, “Stranger Things” abstained from getting too granular in its epilogue — sometimes it's better to imagine whether Jonathan's (Charlie Heaton) film dreams pan out (“The Consumer” sounds terrible, but most student films do), or if Rockin' Robin (Maya Hawke) has a future in radio. (For her sake, I hope she avoided media studies at Smith College.) The highlight, though, is Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and his valedictorian speech. Invoking lost childhoods to an in-world audience who just suffered through a giant “earthquake” and an ensuing military occupation as well as an at-home audience who just suffered through COVID and… an ensuing military occupation lent Dustin's speech just enough extra heft to overlook the intentionally imperfect analogy. “Stranger Things” is not part of the resistance, I'm sorry, we already discussed this, but that doesn't make what he says any less effective. Dustin deserves his happy ending, and his closing speech certainly landed more on the side of “chaotic good” than bad. As much as I appreciated the “Stranger Things” finale's attempt to provide closure without going overboard, the only reasonable way to read Eleven's fate is a tease. How long until the sound of roaring waterfalls loses its white-noise allure? As for Mike, sure, he could just “accept” her choice, as Hopper suggests, and leave Eleven alone for the rest of his life… or he could go find her, which I assume he'll have to do when the Mind Flayer returns in whatever sequel Netflix cooks up in five years or so. Heck, if Mike told Hopper his theory, you know the sad dad would be on the next flight to Iceland! That didn't always work out (see: Season 4 and most of Season 5), but it works well enough for an ending that encourages everyone to accept saying goodbye to the things they once loved. When Mike sees Holly (Nell Fisher) take over his D&D table, his instinctual protectiveness, even jealousy, soon fades to pride. He's happy his little sister and her friends can enjoy the same game he did with Dustin, Will, Max, and Lucas. Rather than jump back in and start another quest, he's ready to let them have their turn. “Stranger Things” took its time getting there, but eventually, it had the courage to grow up.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The battle between former colleagues Megyn Kelly and Mark Levin takes a nasty turn as conservative civil war intensifies. Kelly, a former Fox News anchor and NBC host, has been engaged in an increasingly ugly social-media shootout with her former Fox News colleague Mark Levin, the longtime host of the syndicated The Mark Levin Show and star of Fox News' weekend staple Life, Liberty & Levin. The two veteran anchors have been feuding since a Turning Point USA convention in mid-December, when Ben Shapiro‘s keynote speech attacking right-wing conspiracists like Tucker Carlson triggered a mini meltdown in MAGA-world. But what began as a debate over principles and tactics has taken an increasingly personal turn in recent days, with Levin denouncing his former Fox colleague as a “degenerate” and “laughingstock,” and Kelly dismissing Levin as an “irrelevant, bitter man.” Megyn Kelly Lashes Out at Ben Shapiro and Bari Weiss as MAGA Infighting Escalates Megyn Kelly Inks New Deal With SiriusXM, Will Get Her Own Channel “Meg Kelly, whose ratings were so bad on NBC she became a laughingstock, was canned for promoting blackface on Halloween,” Levin wrote, referencing Kelly's untimely departure from the Today show in 2018. This is why she's cool with Candace Owens and Jack Posobiec. “You're an old, irrelevant, bitter, angry man who could never make it in the Fox News primetime. We used to laugh at you there for your red-faced tantrums over … everything.” Shapiro also rapped Kelly, along with Carlson and Steve Bannon, for their failure to renounce the conspiracy-minded podcaster Owens, who has repeatedly suggested, without evidence, that Charlie Kirk, Turning Point's late co-founder, was assassinated in September as part of a global conspiracy that may have involved the Israeli government, the FBI and Kirk's widow, Erika. (Owens responded to Shapiro's remarks by calling him “a midget” and blaming Jews for the slave trade. Kelly has claimed that critics like Shapiro and CBS News president Bari Weiss have been motivated by their support of Israel.) At Fox, where Kelly once served as a popular primetime anchor, the network's usually voluble anchors have stayed silent as their onetime colleagues battle it out. No Fox News personality, other than Levin, has mentioned the contretemps. Who you gonna root for in that fight?” one longtime Fox News producer wryly tells The Hollywood Reporter.
