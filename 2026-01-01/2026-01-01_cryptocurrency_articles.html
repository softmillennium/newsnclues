                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To stream WBNS on your phone, you need the WBNS app. ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan(AP) — Turkmenistan, one of the world's most isolated nations, officially legalized mining and exchanging cryptocurrency on Thursday in a major shift for the country's tightly controlled, gas-dependent economy. Signed by President Serdar Berdimuhamedov, the legislation regulating virtual assets brings cryptocurrencies under civil law and establishes a licensing scheme for cryptocurrency exchanges overseen by the country's central bank. However, digital currencies will still not be recognized as a means of payment, currency, or security. Turkmenistan's internet also remains tightly regulated and controlled by the government. Turkmenistan, a former Soviet country in Central Asia, relies heavily on the export of its vast natural gas reserves to support its economy. China is the country's main importer of gas, and Turkmenistan is currently working on a pipeline to supply gas to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. Turkmenistan also adopted a law introducing electronic visas in April last year, aimed at simplifying entry for foreigners. After gaining independence in 1991, the autocratic nation typically placed strict entry requirements on would-be visitors, with many visa applications turned down for unclear reasons.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin used a New Year's message on Thursday to reflect on a year of major technical progress — and to argue that the network's real test lies in fulfilling its original mission, not in chasing the latest crypto narratives. In his New Year's post on X, Buterin said Ethereum made meaningful progress in 2025 by becoming faster, more reliable and better able to handle growth without sacrificing its decentralized design. Taken together, he said, those changes move Ethereum closer to becoming a new kind of shared computing platform rather than just another blockchain. But Buterin was clear that technical milestones alone are not the end goal. That vision, he believes, centers on applications designed to function without fraud, censorship or third-party control, even if their original developers disappear. He also emphasized resilience, arguing that users should not notice if major infrastructure providers go offline or are compromised. These properties, he suggested, once described everyday tools before the rise of subscription-based digital services that lock users into centralized platforms. That challenge applies not only to the blockchain itself, including the software people use to run nodes and interact with the network, but also to applications built on top of it, which often depend on centralized services despite using decentralized protocols. Whether Ethereum can meet those ambitions will become clearer as the network's next phase shifts from upgrades to real-world use, testing how its ideals hold up under scale. KuCoin captured a record share of centralised exchange volume in 2025, with more than $1.25tn traded as its volumes grew faster than the wider crypto market. The layer-1 network reversed course after ecosystem partners warned that rewriting chain history would undermine decentralization and create operational risks following a $3.9 million exploit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a New Year congratulation on X, Strategy, the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder led by Michael Saylor, wrote that data strategy has never mattered more and pointed to 2025 as the year enterprises moved from fragmented tools to unified, AI-ready data foundations. Basically, their 2026 pitch came as — simplify, scale and unlock insights. This message comes as the Bitcoin side of Strategy's business remains enormous on paper with 672,497 BTC on balance, each of which was bought at an average cost per coin of $75,004. As it stands, the unrealized gain right now amounts to 17.04%, and the whole stash is valued at around $59.04 billion. In 2025, organizations moved from fragmented tools to unified, AI-ready data foundations. In 2026, we will keep helping enterprises simplify, scale, and unlock insights. However, the equity is acting as if it wants a different story. A TradingView chart shows MSTR at $151.95 on the day, down 2.35%, after a long comedown from 2025 highs. This serves as a reminder that Bitcoin exposure currently is a crowded trade, especially when the chart stops cooperating. The firm's own dashboard puts mNAV at 0.739 (basic), 0.824 (diluted) and 0.967 (EV), which indicates that the market is not paying a premium for the coins right now. If enterprise AI spending continues to accelerate, then budgets will be allocated to data foundations and semantic layers, and Strategy is signaling it plans to be there whether Bitcoin is trending or not.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For decades, businesses have faced long settlement times, high transaction costs, and complex documentation when trading internationally. Read also: Trends in Trade Finance: Opportunities for Small and Medium Enterprises Trade finance, the system that enables importers and exporters to conduct business smoothly has long been hindered by outdated infrastructure. Banks, insurers, and trade bodies typically oversee these transactions to ensure trust between parties that might not know each other personally. For smaller businesses, these barriers can significantly restrict international participation. At the core of blockchain's impact on trade finance is its ability to create a secure, decentralized, and immutable ledger that records every transaction transparently. Unlike traditional systems, where each participant maintains separate records, blockchain ensures that all stakeholders including banks, suppliers, and buyers share a single source of truth. This transparency dramatically reduces the risk of fraud and errors, two major concerns in international trade. It also minimizes the need for intermediaries by enabling smart contracts, self-executing agreements coded on the blockchain that automatically trigger payment or document release once predefined conditions are met. For example, in a blockchain-enabled trade transaction, once goods are confirmed as shipped and received, payment can be automatically released to the supplier without waiting for manual verification. This automation reduces settlement times from days to mere minutes, increasing both efficiency and liquidity. Global institutions are already experimenting with blockchain-based trade finance platforms. These platforms are transforming traditional letters of credit into fully digital, real-time systems that ensure both trust and speed. Through digital platforms and mobile applications, fintech firms are removing the friction historically associated with international transactions. Unlike traditional banks, fintech payment providers leverage technology to offer real-time currency conversion, instant settlement, and reduced fees. Digital lending platforms use alternative data such as transaction history, supply chain performance, and trade volumes to assess creditworthiness. This data-driven approach allows smaller businesses to obtain working capital and participate in global markets without facing the constraints of traditional banking. Together, they are creating a seamless trade finance ecosystem that bridges the gap between traditional banking and digital innovation. For example, blockchain-enabled fintech platforms can offer instant cross-border settlements that are verifiable and traceable, reducing counterparty risk. Such systems also facilitate regulatory compliance by recording transactions on immutable ledgers, providing auditors and regulators with real-time insights. This synergy also holds immense potential for emerging markets, where infrastructure limitations have traditionally hindered trade finance access. Despite its promise, the transition to blockchain- and fintech-based trade finance is not without challenges. The lack of standardized regulations, limited interoperability between blockchain platforms, and concerns around data privacy have slowed widespread adoption. Additionally, the integration of new technologies into existing financial systems requires significant investment and collaboration across industries. However, as global institutions, governments, and fintech startups continue to collaborate, these barriers are gradually being addressed. The future of trade finance lies in open, interoperable systems that connect businesses, banks, and regulators through digital infrastructure. By automating trust, reducing transaction costs, and improving access to capital, these technologies are democratizing global trade for businesses of all sizes. As adoption accelerates, the next generation of trade finance will be defined by transparency, speed, and inclusivity, fostering stronger connections between global economies. In this new era, technology will not just facilitate trade but it will empower it, paving the way for a smarter, more efficient, and sustainable global financial ecosystem.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthony Scaramucci says a friendlier US policy mix: rate cuts, looser financial conditions, and a renewed push for crypto legislation could set up 2026 as a better tape for “quality” altcoins, even after what he described as an unexpectedly bruising 2025 for the sector. In a Dec. 31 interview with Altcoin Daily, the SkyBridge Capital founder framed 2025 as a year where positioning and sentiment broke down under selling pressure he said he didn't anticipate. Scaramucci said he now sees the setup improving precisely because sentiment turned so negative. “We were tilted to the bulls, we're now decidedly very bearish,” he said, claiming his internal “bull meter” sits around 13 or 14 out of 100. The flip side, he argued, is that incremental good news, less large-holder selling, steadier ETF inflows, or regulatory progress, could matter more than usual. A central part of Scaramucci's thesis was that the market still expects US market-structure legislation to pass, and that the timeline matters. “I do think it is detrimental because I do think there is still a market expectation that it's going to pass. He also tied the policy fight to a broader economic claim: “There's between, depending on how you measure it, there's three and a half to $4 trillion dollars worth of transaction verification expenses in the global economy per year… If you could get that down, let's say you cut it in half, you could unleash a $2 trillion capital spend in other areas of the economy or just better wages for people.” Pressed on odds of passage before the midterms, Scaramucci said it should be “north of 50%,” arguing Democrats have learned there is “no anti-crypto voter,” while crypto-aligned spending can be decisive in tight races. Asked for his current top-three altcoins, Scaramucci named Solana first, followed by Avalanche and Telegram-linked TON. “My three top coins then would be Solana, it would be Avalanche and believe it or not… it would be the Telegram token known as Ton,” he said, while acknowledging he has been early or wrong on timing. He said he first bought TON at $7.50, averaging near $4.00, while saying it was trading around $1.50 at the time of the interview, but still sees it as a token that could be used across Telegram's network as it grows. 1, Scaramucci kept it simple and comparative: “Cheap, low cost, very fast, easy to use, easy to develop on,” he said, adding he's “not an Ethereum negative person” and expects “a multicoin world.” Scaramucci expects “two to four interest rate cuts” next year and argued a president facing midterms will want growth optics. For bitcoin, he stuck with his $150,000 call—“I'm off by a year, I think”—and said he recently “bought more Bitcoin” for his family, betting that ETF flows and easier policy can overpower the hangover from 2025's whale-driven selling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Synopsis: Trump Media will distribute blockchain tokens to DJT shareholders via Crypto.com's Cronos blockchain, offering rewards like discounts and special access to company products. This marks a groundbreaking move that blends traditional equity with cryptocurrency rewards. The announcement sent ripples through both stock and crypto markets. DJT shares climbed 3.18% to $12.97 in pre-market trading following the news. Trump Media partnered with Crypto.com to build the token on its Cronos blockchain. Shareholders will receive tokens based on a simple one-to-one ratio. Each whole share of DJT stock equals one digital token. The token offers something different from traditional shareholder benefits. These perks could include discounts and special access to Trump Media products. CEO Devin Nunes emphasized the innovative nature of this distribution model. “We look forward to utilizing Crypto.com's blockchain technology and improving regulatory clarity,” Nunes stated. He added that this first-of-its-kind token distribution aims to reward shareholders fairly. However, the token does not represent actual equity in Trump Media. Holders will not gain voting rights or claims on company earnings. He has voiced strong support for the cryptocurrency industry throughout 2025. In November, Trump declared his vision for America to become a “bitcoin superpower.” This presidential endorsement adds weight to the company's blockchain initiative. It signals confidence in digital assets as legitimate business tools. Therefore, Trump Media's move could encourage other publicly traded companies to explore similar programs. The model demonstrates how blockchain can enhance shareholder value beyond traditional dividends. Trump Media confirmed that shareholders must hold whole shares to qualify for tokens. Shareholders can likely manage their tokens through Crypto.com's platform or compatible wallets. Shareholders could see discounts on Truth Social subscriptions or exclusive Truth+ content. Truth Predict users might receive special features or promotional offers. Tokens do not grant access to financial information or company decisions. They serve purely as a loyalty program enhanced by blockchain technology. Industry experts view this as a test case for tokenized rewards programs. Robinhood faced criticism in June for offering tokenized private equity without traditional ownership rights. Trump Media's approach differs by clearly stating the token's limitations upfront. The company explicitly confirmed tokens do not represent equity stakes. This transparency may help avoid regulatory confusion or shareholder disputes. The program showcases how traditional companies can adopt blockchain without fully tokenizing securities. It creates a middle ground between conventional shareholder perks and cryptocurrency investments. Other corporations may follow this model to engage tech-savvy investors. Trump Media expects to provide comprehensive program details by early 2026. Shareholders await information about distribution dates, wallet requirements, and specific reward structures.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Data Point Decoding the headlines with facts, figures, and numbers Trump launched a meme coin called $TRUMP, which reached more than $14.5 billion in ‍market value before crashing [File] | Photo Credit: REUTERS Trump Media and Technology Group said on Wednesday ​it will distribute a new digital token to its ‌shareholders, deepening its push into digital ​assets as policy support for cryptocurrencies builds in Washington. Shares of the company linked to U.S. President Donald Trump, which operates his social media platform Truth Social, were last up 5% in early trading. Trump courted industry cash on the ‌campaign trail by pledging to be a “crypto president,” while ‌his family's own crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial, have helped push the sector further ‍into the mainstream. Days before his inauguration, Trump launched a meme coin called $TRUMP, which reached more than $14.5 billion in ‍market value before crashing. The White House has rejected allegations of conflicts of interest, saying Trump's multibillion-dollar real estate, golf, media and other business interests are held in a trust managed by his children. DJT shareholders will receive one new digital token for each share they hold, the company said, with more details on the launch expected ⁠in 2026. The launch comes amid ​a downturn in crypto prices, with bitcoin down 6% this ⁠year and heading for its first annual loss since 2022. The pullback reflects a broader shift away from risk as investors cut exposure to more volatile assets. They cannot be abusive or personal.
