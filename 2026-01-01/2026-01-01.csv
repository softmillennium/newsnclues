Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has repeatedly stated that reunification with Taiwan is “inevitable,” reiterated the notion in his address to the nation on New Year's Eve, touting an unbreakable “bond of blood and kinship.”

Taiwan has been ruled by Chinese nationalist forces as the Republic of China ever since they retreated to the island after their defeat in the civil war in 1949.

Beijing considers the island part of its sovereign territory under the One China policy.

“We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share a bond of blood and kinship. The reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable!,” Xi said on Wednesday, as cited by Xinhua.

The Chinese leader also noted that Beijing would “support Hong Kong and Macao in better integrating into the overall development of our country and maintaining long-term prosperity and stability.”

Beijing has repeatedly emphasized a preference for peaceful reunification, but has not ruled out the use of force should the island's “separatist forces” seek formal independence.

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted two days of military drills around Taiwan this week, simulating a blockade of key ports, precision strikes on maritime targets, and scenarios to counter external interference.

The drills commenced just 11 days after Washington announced an $11.1 billion arms sales package to Taiwan – the largest ever for the island. 

Both China and Taiwan maintain a One-China policy and claim to be the rightful rulers of China. However, only a handful of countries maintain official diplomatic relations with Taipei, while most endorse Beijing. 

Since October 1971, the UN has recognized the People's Republic of China (PRC) as “the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations.”

While the US government stated in 1979 that it “recognizes the Government of the [PRC] as the sole legal Government of China,"" it continues to maintain close ties with Taipei, which include visits by top lawmakers, and has repeatedly been reproached by Beijing.

Russia's support for China with respect to Taiwan is enshrined in the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, which was signed between Moscow and Beijing in July 2001, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov recalled in a recent interview, stressing that one of its basic principles is “mutual support in defending national unity and territorial integrity.” 

Lavrov said Taiwan is currently being used as a tool of “military-strategic deterrence” against Beijing, with some Western countries keen to profit from Taiwanese money and technology.

MOSCOW, January 1. /TASS/. The Ukrainian army carried out a drone attack on a cafe and a hotel in the village of Khorly in the Kherson Region, where civilians were celebrating the New Year, Governor Vladimir Saldo said.

According to preliminary reports, over 24 people, including a child, were killed, and another 29 people, among them five kids, suffered injuries.

TASS has collected the key information about the attack.

Drone strike

Saldo said that three Ukrainian drones had hit a cafe and a hotel in Khorly in the Black Sea coast village of Khorly, where civilians were celebrating the New Year.

The strike caused a fire that engulfed 500 square meters and was put out at 8:40 a.m. Moscow time (5:40 a.m. GMT), the governor's spokesman Vladimir Vasilenko told TASS.

The Russian Investigative Committee launched a criminal investigation based on Article 205 of the Russian Criminal Code (""Terrorist Attack""), committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said.

Casualties

As many as 29 people were taken to the hospital, among them children born in 2008, 2012, 2018, and 2019, Vasilenko specified.

Thirteen of those injured are hospitalized in Crimea and the Kherson Region. Six of them are in serious conciliation, Assistant Health Minister Alexey Kuznetsov told TASS.

Terrorist attack and Kiev regime's agony

The Kherson region's governor believes that ""the terrorist attack on Khorly, which targeted defenseless women and children, is a sign of the Kiev regime's agony.""

""Many people were burned alive. A child was killed. In fact, the crime can be compared to what happened in Odessa's Trade Union House,"" Saldo added, referring to the May 2, 2014 developments in the Ukrainian city of Odessa, where 48 people died in a fire set by radical nationalists.

Russian Federation Council (upper house of parliament) Chair Valentina Matviyehnko stressed that the drone attack on the Kherson Region was only strengthening Russia's resolve to achieve the goals of its special military operation as soon as possible.

Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova pointed out that ""those who sponsor the bastard terrorists in Ukraine"" were primarily to blame for the attack on civilians in the Kherson Region.

All countries ""should make a proper legal and political assessment of this inhumane act"" as ""the killing of dozens of civilians cannot go unanswered,"" Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's Ambassador-at-Large tasked with overseeing the Kiev regime's crimes, emphasized.

The Kiev regime ordered the Ukrainian army to attack civilians in such a brutal manner to revenge on them for choosing to live in Russia, a country free of Nazism, and speak their native Russian language, Viktor Vodolatsky, first deputy chair of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) Committee for CIS Affairs, Eurasian Integration and Relations with Compatriots, told TASS.

Mourning declaration

Kherson Region Governor Vladimir Saldo declared two days of mourning on January 2 and 3 in memory of the victims of the attack.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

NEW YORK, January 1. /TASS/. The US military has launched new attacks on the vessels targeting two boats allegedly used by members of drug cartels killing five people, the US Southern Command said.

According to a message on X, the joint task force of Operation Southern Spear struck on December 31 on the orders of the Minister of War Pete Hegseth.

Intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and were involved in drug smuggling, the US Southern Command said.

As a result of the strikes, the command said, three people were killed on board the first boat, and two in the second.

Washington unfairly accuses Caracas of not actively fighting drug smuggling. As The New York Times reported in August, US President Donald Trump signed a non-public directive on the beginning of the use of military force against Latin American drug cartels. After that, significant additional American forces were deployed to the Caribbean, including a strike group of ships led by the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford. In recent months, the US military has destroyed about 30 boats off the coast of Latin America under the pretext of combating drug smuggling, and more than 100 people have been killed. After one of these strikes, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said that the American operation had killed a fisherman from his country, not a drug dealer.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

From freezing rents to free buses and municipal grocery stores – a recap of the policies that won Mamdani the office

Zohran Mamdani was sworn into office as New York's 111th mayor at the stroke of midnight, the first Muslim mayor as well as the first to take office as a Democrat bearing the credentials of a democratic socialist.

The 34-year-old was sworn in by Letitia James, the state attorney general, in a disused subway station beneath city hall that acts as turnaround for the local 5 train, to be followed by a first-of-its-kind public block party along Broadway's “Canyon of Heroes”.

“I cannot wait to see everyone tomorrow as we begin our term,” Mamdani said from a wide subway staircase. “This is truly the honor and the privilege of a lifetime.”

Mamdani said last year that he campaigned “in poetry”, that is with a sense of idealism, but would govern “in prose”, that is with practicality. Now the job of governing begins, and navigating the politically complex terrain of America's largest city where ideological principles may not smoothly translate to effective governance.

Mamdani and his transition team have appointed more than 400 New Yorkers to serve as advisers on personnel and policy. The overriding theme is to deliver on the mayor's affordability, or economic rights, agenda. Mamdani's platform, according to his website, is built off the premise that “New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier.”

The mayor's campaign noted that 2m New Yorkers live in rent stabilized apartments and “these homes should be the bedrock of economic security for the city's working class”. He has promised to freeze rent increases, but he does not have direct power to do that and must get around a rent guidelines board that does.

Mamdani has also pledged to triple the city's production of “permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes” – constructing 200,000 new units over the next decade – and crack down on negligent landlords.

Mamdani says every New Yorker deserves to be safe and that requires “creating economic stability, dignified work, and well-resourced neighborhoods”. A newly formed Department of Community Safety will be assigned “to prevent violence before it happens by taking a public health approach to safety”. In practice, that may mean sending civilian mental health workers – not the police or fire department – to intervene in mental health crises.

Mamdani proposes that municipal grocery stores, using city-owned buildings and selling at wholesale prices, would help defray rising grocery costs. He estimates that one in five New Yorkers struggle to afford public transport. He plans to eliminate bus fares on every city bus and build new bus lanes to make them faster. He also plans to clamp down on misleading advertising and predatory contracts, and ban all hidden fees. At his inauguration, Mamdani appointed veteran city planner Mike Flynn as the new transportation secretary for New York.

Mamdani says the biggest cost for working New Yorkers after rent is childcare costs, and it is driving families with children from the city. He proposes free childcare for every New Yorker aged six weeks to five years. With 125,000 babies born yearly in the city, new mothers will get “a collection of essential goods and resources, free of charge, including items like diapers, baby wipes, nursing pads, post-partum pads, swaddles, and books”. He also plans to finance an expansion of K12 childhood education services.

The cost of Mamdani's program is put at $10bn a year. But the city is essentially a vassal of the state and there is no guarantee the state government will agree. Mamdani plans to raise the top corporate tax rate from 7.25% to 11.5% – a hike that he estimates will raise $5bn a year. He also plans to raise personal income taxes on the top 1% of earners, or about 34,000 households earning over $1m a year, by 2%. Mamdani estimates that will raise an additional $4bn.

Mamdani says he plans to champion a new city law to bring the minimum wage to $30 an hour by 2030. “In the world's richest city, making the minimum wage shouldn't mean living in poverty,” his manifesto argues. “But that's exactly what it means for working people today.”

Mamdani, despite his surprisingly festive meeting with Donald Trump at the White House in November, claims the president “is tearing at the fabric of New York City”. He plans to “fight Trump's attempts to gouge the working class”, strengthen the city's sanctuary city apparatus, get Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) out of city facilities, end any ICE cooperation and boost immigration legal services to an estimated 400,000 New Yorkers who are at risk of deportation.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Nationwide protests against living conditions enter fifth day with security forces reportedly using live ammunition

The largest protests in Iran for three years entered a fifth day on Thursday amid reports of deadly clashes between protesters and security forces, with state-affiliated media confirming at least two people had been killed.

Although state media did not identify those killed, witnesses and videos circulating on social media appear to show protesters lying motionless on the ground after security forces opened fire.

The Guardian has also received images showing two bodies bearing what appear to be pellet and bullet wounds, though the circumstances surrounding the images could not be independently verified.

The Oslo-based Hengaw Organisation for Human Rights said one of those killed had been struck by live ammunition and died before being taken to a medical facility.

The two deaths were reported to have occurred in the southwestern city of Lordegan.

Activists and human rights groups have warned of an escalation in the response to the protests and say a brutal crackdown is under way as security forces continue to fire directly at protesters. An eyewitness in a message relayed to the Guardian said: “It's a battlefield here and they [security forces] are firing mercilessly.”

Ebrahim Eshaghi, an Iranian wrestler who lives in Germany, but comes from the city of Lordegan and has been in touch with protesters on the ground, said: “Today, the people of my city came out into the streets to demand their rights. So far, two young people have been killed and many more have been injured. We ask all the people of the world to be our voice. The Islamic Republic is the enemy of us all.”

Video footage shared on social media appears to show the use of gunfire by security forces against protesters as crowds run through smoke-filled streets and apparently injured people are carried away.'

The protests, initially sparked by the collapse of the national currency, began on Sunday in the capital, Tehran, but have since spread to cities across the country, with demonstrators chanting for economic justice and demanding an end to the regime.

Roya Boroumand, managing director of the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran, said the protests were being driven by the drop in the value of currency and its impact on the cost of living.

“Iranians are living below poverty lines in increasing numbers and have no hope [of] any notable improvement of their living conditions. They are angry at the state's mismanagement and corruption, and policies that are causing misery inside the country. The state deems any protest that is anti-government illegal and the law does not really open space to legal protest. That is why we see a pattern of popular outbursts and deadly crackdown.”

The protests come after a year of a record number of executions in Iran, with more than 1,500 people put to death in 2025 – the highest number since 1989. Human rights groups say the Iranian authorities have used the death penalty to instil fear among the population and crush dissent.

“Executions are being carried out following grossly unfair trials held behind closed doors, amid widespread patterns of torture and forced confessions,” said Amnesty director Hussein Baoumi.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

British charitable trust that draws on OxyContin-maker fortune says it exempted names to protect reputations

Two charities that received a combined total of more than £1.1m from the British charitable trust run by the Sackler family were kept out of its latest accounts to protect their reputations from “serious prejudice”.

The trust, which draws on the Sackler fortune that came out of the US opioid crisis, gave £3.8m to arts, eduction and science bodies in 2024, according to its latest accounts, filed on New Year's Eve.

The largest named recipients – each receiving £250,000 – were Veterans Aid, which tackles homelessness in the ex-service community, and the Belvoir Cricket and Countryside Trust, which works to develop an appreciation for the British countryside and promotes a love of sport, especially cricket.

The Sackler Trust is shunned by leading arts bodies and others who have refused donations or stopped accepting them because of the Sackler family's links to the US opioid crisis and the painkiller OxyContin.

The National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery, Royal Opera House, Shakespeare's Globe and Tate were among the institutions to cut ties or drop grants in the face of pressure over the family's ownership and control of Purdue Pharma, the company that developed and aggressively marketed the addictive painkiller OxyContin.

The trust announced in 2019 it was pausing all new donations, but quietly resumed doing so in 2020. Its latest accounts, as has been the case in recent years, exempts the names of a number of entities receiving grants.

The accounts state: “The trust considers that further reporting will expose the recipients to serious prejudice and impair the furtherance of their charitable activities.”

Recipients who were named and who received £60,000 or more include Happy Day Ministries, Peterborough Asylum and Refugee Community Association, Waterlife Recovery Trust, Cliftonville Community Centre, Inside Job/Beating Time, Living Room, Mustard Tree and Not Beyond Redemption.

Two recipients of grants – totalling £1,150,000 – were exempted from disclosure in the accounts filed to Companies House. A total of 98 grants were issued in 2024, compared with 69 in the previous year.

The trust was committed to £7.4m of grants at the end of 2024, which included some carrying over from the previous year. The trust gave £5.27m in grants in 2022.

The Sackler Trust continues to be chaired by Dame Theresa Sackler, a former trustee of the V&A who sat on the Purdue board from 1993-2018. She is the widow of Mortimer Sackler, one of the three brothers who ran Purdue Pharma.

Dame Theresa's children – Michael, Marissa and Sophia – are trustees of the family charity, which has assets totalling £50m.

A US judge said in November he would approve Purdue Pharma's latest deal to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids that includes some money for thousands of victims of the epidemic.

The deal, overseen by the US bankruptcy judge Sean Lane, would require some of the multibillionaire members of the semi-reclusive Sackler family who own the company to contribute up to $7bn (£5bn) and give up ownership of the Connecticut-based company.

Members of the Sackler family who own the privately held Purdue, which now-deceased members of the family grew into a specialist in pain treatment in the early 1990s, became philanthropists using the huge profits generated by sales of OxyContin.

The Sackler family's reputation took a dive when investigative journalism and activism exposed the company's expansionist drive to increase prescriptions of the opioid despite growing addiction and deaths across the US. While the Sacklers have donated millions over the years to charitable interests, some have accused them of using the giving of money as a means of “reputation laundering”.

The Sackler Trust has been approached for comment.

At the time of its move to pause the trust's giving, Dame Theresa said in a statement issued on behalf of the trustees: “I am deeply saddened by the addiction crisis in America and support the actions Purdue Pharma is taking to help tackle the situation, whilst still rejecting the false allegations made against the company and several members of the Sackler family.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A volunteer member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp was killed in a western province during widening demonstrations sparked by the country's ailing economy, authorities said yesterday, marking the first fatality among security forces during the protests.

The death on Wednesday night of the 21-year-old volunteer in the Guard's Basij force might mark the start of a heavier-handed response by Iran's theocracy over the demonstrations, which have slowed in the capital, Tehran, but expanded to other provinces.

The state-run IRNA news agency reported on the Guard member's death, but did not elaborate. An Iranian news agency called the Student News Network, believed to be close to the Basij, directly blamed demonstrators for the Guard member's death, citing comments from Lorestan Province Deputy Governor Saeed Pourali.

The Guard member “was martyred ... at the hands of rioters during protests in this city in defense of public order,” he reportedly said.

Another 13 Basij members and police officers sustained injuries, he added.

“The protests that have occurred are due to economic pressures, inflation and currency fluctuations, and are an expression of livelihood concerns,” Pourali said. “The voices of citizens must be heard carefully and tactfully, but people must not allow their demands to be strained by profit-seeking individuals.”

The protests took place in the city of Kouhdasht, more than 400km southwest of Tehran.

Under reformist Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, the civilian government has been trying to signal that it wants to negotiate with protesters.

However, Pezeshkian has acknowledged there is not much he can do as Iran's rial has rapidly depreciated, with US$1 now costing about 1.4 million rials.

State television separately reported on the arrests of seven people, including five it described as monarchists and two others it said had links to European-based groups. State TV also said another operation saw security forces confiscate 100 smuggled pistols, without elaborating.

The protests have become the biggest in Iran since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody triggered nationwide demonstrations.

The demonstrations have yet to be countrywide and have not been as intense as those surrounding the death of Amini, who was detained over not wearing her hijab, or headscarf, to the liking of authorities.

The protests began in Tehran, where shopkeepers went on strike over the high cost of living and economic stagnation, before spreading to other cities, after students from at least 10 universities joined in on Tuesday.

Iran is in the middle of an extended weekend, with the authorities declaring Wednesday a bank holiday at the last minute, citing the need to save energy during the cold weather, but likely as a bid to get people out of the capital. The Iranian weekend is Thursday and Friday, while Saturday marks Imam Ali's birthday, another holiday for many.

The protests, taking root in economic issues, have heard demonstrators chant against Iran's theocracy as well.

Iran's prosecutor general on Wednesday said that peaceful economic protests were legitimate, but any attempt to create insecurity would be met with a “decisive response.”

“This is truly the honor and the privilege of a lifetime,” Mamdani said in a brief speech.

“Thank you all so much, now I will see you later,” he said with a smile before heading up a flight of stairs.

Mamdani was to be sworn in again, in grander style, in a public ceremony at City Hall at 1pm by US Senator Bernie Sanders, one of the mayor's political heroes.

Mamdani was a trailblazing candidate and is expected by many in the city of 8 million — some with hope, some with trepidation — to be a disruptive mayor.

In a campaign that helped make “affordability” a buzzword across the political spectrum, the democratic socialist promised to bring transformative change with policies intended to lower the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive cities. His platform included free childcare, free buses, a rent freeze for about 1 million households and a pilot of city-run grocery stores.

However, he would also have to face other responsibilities: handling trash and snow and rats, while getting blamed for subway delays and potholes.

Syracuse University political science professor Grant Reeher said that James' role in the inauguration would send a message to core supporters that Mamdani is “going to be independent of the [US] president.”

James had led an investigation in US President Donald Trump's business practices during Trump's first term.

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) faked the death of Denis Kapustin, commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK), and claimed the bounty placed on his head by Russia's intelligence service, HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov revealed on Jan. 1.

""Welcome back to life,"" Budanov said on a Telegram video, while congratulating Kapustin and the intelligence team involved in the operation.

The announcement follows reports published on Dec. 27 stating that Kapustin, also known by his nom de guerre ""White Rex,"" had been killed during a combat mission in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. In its Jan. 1 statement, HUR said those reports were part of a complex special operation that misled Russian intelligence services.

Russian intelligence services had ordered his assassination and allocated a bounty of $500,000 for the successful completion of the assassination.

""Our side also obtained the funds allocated by Russian intelligence services to carry out this crime,"" Budanov was told by the commander of the Timur special unit in the video. 

""As of now, the RDK commander is on Ukrainian territory and is preparing to continue carrying out assigned tasks,.""

Budanov welcomed Kapustin during the briefing.

""First of all, Mr. Denis, congratulations on your return to life. That is always a pleasure. I am glad that the money allocated for your assassination was used to support our struggle,"" Budanov said. 

Kapustin said his temporary absence had not affected the unit's operations and confirmed his readiness to continue leading the Russian Volunteer Corps.

""My temporary absence did not affect the quality or success of combat missions. I am ready to move to the area of operations and continue commanding the RDK,"" he said.

The Russian Volunteer Corps, led by Kapustin, carried out cross-border incursions into Russia's Belgorod and Kursk oblasts in 2023 and 2024, operating alongside other anti-Kremlin Russian formations linked to Ukraine's defense and security forces, like the Freedom of Russia Legion and the Siberian Battalion. 

The public reveal marks the second known instance of pro-Ukrainian figures faking their own deaths to the detriment of Moscow.

In May 2018, Arkady Babchenko, a prominent Russian journalist known for his opposition to the regime of Russian President Vladimir Putin, faked his own death with the the assistance of Ukraine Security Service (SBU). 

Babchenko was revealed to be alive during a news conference in Kyiv, following a coordinated operation to collect evidence on the staged assassination after indications emerged that Russian operatives were planning a real attempt on his life.

Maria Harchevna, a 25-year-old dentist, describes Pokrovsk as a small, cozy town surrounded by endless fields.

""For me, it is associated with the very warm evenings in May, the scent of lilacs and wildflowers. It is eternal youth and carelessness,"" she told the Kyiv Independent. ""At the same time, it is an industrial city where thousands of miners and farmers work tirelessly.""

The Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk is now the site of some of the fiercest fighting of Russia's war against Ukraine. Once a key logistics hub for Ukrainian forces, it has become the focus of a long and bloody Russian offensive. Capturing Pokrovsk would give Russia a springboard toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, two of the largest remaining Ukrainian-held cities in Donetsk Oblast, and Ukraine has said more than 150,000 Russian troops are concentrated on this axis.

Russian troops control most of Pokrovsk, including the center, and claim to have taken the city, but Ukrainian commanders say their forces have maintained control of its northern districts and recaptured around 16 square kilometers (9.9 square miles), even as months of Russian bombardment have left the city in ruins.

For those who grew up there, the Pokrovsk they now see on the news is almost unrecognizable.

""Every time I see photos of my war-torn city, I feel immense pain, even physical at times. All memories of my childhood seem like a dream, as if it never really happened and I made it all up,"" Harchevna said. ""Russia destroyed not just residential buildings, but people's lives, hopes, and plans for the future.""

While the city is being destroyed by Russian forces, former residents of Pokrovsk look back on the years between 2014 and Russia's full-scale invasion to share their bittersweet memories about their city.

Before the full-scale invasion, more than 60,000 people lived in Pokrovsk. It was a key Ukrainian logistics hub tucked away in what was then a relatively quiet part of Donetsk Oblast.

In 2014, when the war in the east of Ukraine began, many Pokrovsk residents were worried about what would happen next, but that didn't stop the city's rapid growth.

Daria Polonska, 29, told the Kyiv Independent that before the full-scale invasion, new businesses were popping up all over the city —  beauty salons, restaurants, and clinics and hospitals.

""Pokrovsk tried to be the best of the best until the very end.""

Even after the full-scale war began, ""people did their utmost to make the city better"" amid regular missile attacks. After attacks, city workers were quick to make repairs, while doctors ""did the impossible"" to save and stabilize the wounded. Even as Russian forces approached, residents kept the streets clean and businesses running.

""When the city was 17 kilometers from the front line, Ukrainian soldiers joked about the possibility of buying sweet strawberries, exotic fruits, and a dozen types of shrimp at a local market in winter,"" Polonska said.

Polonska evacuated from Pokrovsk on Sept. 3, 2024, when it became unbearable to live there. Her thoughts, however, often return to the places she left behind.

""My family had a dacha (summer house) near the Zelenivsky spoil tip, and I used to play there without even realising that one day I would be willing to give anything to see it again.""

Two months prior to the evacuation, her family buried a relative who was killed by a Russian missile at his workplace, an incident she describes as ""the point of no return.""

""I lost a loved one because of the war, and I lost my home because of the war. And I can say that these feelings are very similar. You feel grief so deep that you want to climb the walls.""

Daria Korkh, a 40-year-old activist and animal volunteer, described Pokrovsk as a city of miners.

""I come from a mining family; my father worked in the mines there for 30 years. I am very proud of Donbas because we knew how to work, how to earn money,"" Korkh said.

When the full-scale war began, Korkh and her husband also provided Pokrovsk residents with medicines and humanitarian aid. Now her husband serves in the Ukrainian army.

""Together with my husband, we had just built our dream house with solar panels, and now there is nothing left of it. He had a good job, was a skilled professional, and had the opportunity to avoid going to war. But after what happened in Pokrovsk, he decided to join the army.""

Korkh had an animal shelter in Pokrovsk, but was forced to relocate it to Cherkasy Oblast, central Ukraine, due to the intensification of hostilities. They also helped their neighbours and friends to relocate.

""We looked for houses for our friends nearby, and helped five more families move to Cherkasy Oblast. It's great to have your own people around, a little easier emotionally.""

But still she says she has to force herself to go on living, because she is not at home. The hardest thing for Korkh is that she is not able to visit the graves of her relatives in Pokrovsk.

""My mum died during the war. It hurts me that I cannot visit her grave,"" she said.

""Russians took our dead ones away.""

Before the active battles in the city, Pokrovsk was known among soldiers and volunteers as a meeting point and a place for rest. Soldiers returning from the frontlines further east could receive a wide range of services, from a new haircut to a tasty borsch.

Oleksiy Nazarenko, a former infantryman of the 47th Separate Mechanised Brigade 'Magura,' spent some time recovering from combat injuries in Pokrovsk in 2023-2024. One of the most popular places among soldiers was the Bulvar shopping mall.

""Bulvar was a place where soldiers would meet, talk, eat, share news, and go on with their business. You could meet soldiers from different brigades there,"" Nazarenko said.

The mall was hit and destroyed by a Russian strike in 2024.

Architect, a drone operator who was fighting in the Pokrovsk direction, said that all the cities in that direction are dear to his heart.

""There we, soldiers, leave behind our most turbulent years. Meetings, farewells, shawarma, and shitty coffee, packages from family at Nova Poshta, military stores, and tire repair shops with endless queues of cars. And people, people, people... Bombs, drones, and dust,"" he said.

""Everything is mixed together. Each such city is like a heart in a torn chest, but still pulsing. And then it fades away. The fire spreads to the next one. And we dig into its basements and walls with the same force.""

The most vivid memory of Harchevna's childhood is Christmas holidays in Pokrovsk, when she would decorate the Christmas tree with her parents, play festive melodies on the piano, go sledding, and ski in the snowy park.

Every Christmas, she visited her grandparents, sang ""Shchedryk"" (Carol of the bells), and received candy in return. Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych lived and worked in Pokrovsk, where he, as some believe, completed his world-famous Christmas song.

""In honor of this, there were plans to open the 'Shchedryk Park' cultural space, but unfortunately, this did not happen,"" Harchevna said.

Harchevna moved to Kyiv to study at the age of 17, but she would visit Pokrovsk every year. She last visited Pokrovsk in November 2023, trying to remember all her favorite places, which had already been damaged by Russian missiles.

Hanna, 24, remembers places popular among local youth, such as Yuvileynyi Park and the main city square, where children and teenagers often gathered.

""I really loved the main square, it was like a meeting place. The city wasn't very big, everyone knew each other. You could just go out for a walk, and an hour later, you'd be singing songs to guitar music with a group of people. I don't think I've ever met such friendly people. It always impressed me,"" Hanna said.

But still, her favorite place was her home — a small brick house with a red wooden roof, with green leafy plants in the window. She described it as ""the most peaceful and precious place in the world.""

Hanna's father died when she was six years old, and the house was almost the only thing she had left of him, so it was very important to her emotionally.

""I felt safe there. But after 24 Feb. 2022, I no longer feel protected anywhere. Now, with active fighting going on in the city, I feel as if a part of my soul has been torn away,"" Hanna said.


""As long as I remember it, it remains alive.""
    

Hanna says that the only thing that warms her heart now is that she was able to get her grandmother out of ""this hell."" 

At first, her grandmother refused to leave her home, but in Feb. 2025, when she couldn't take it anymore, she left the city on foot, taking her most important belongings. She met Ukrainian soldiers in Dobropillia, from where Hanna picked her up.

""My grandma is 87 years old, and she is truly a heroine,"" Hanna said.

She still has fond memories of the time they spent together in her grandmother's house.

""My most precious memories are definitely of how we always gathered at my grandmother's house for all the holidays, when the whole family was together. Now I don't even know if my uncle and his family are alive, as they didn't want to leave the city. This is very scary,"" Hanna added.

Hanna's mother, Tetiana, spent nearly her entire life in Pokrovsk. Now she sees how Russia is destroying not just buildings, but her memories, ""the places of youth, years of work, family moments.""

Tetiana last visited in May 2024, returning to see her mother and her home. Currently, she resides in the Czech Republic, where she works in a factory. She said she suffered together with Pokrovsk.

""It is the pain an entire generation is going through,"" Tetiana said. ""Pokrovsk is a part of my biography,"" she added. ""As long as I remember it, it remains alive.""

Despite being a calmer New Year's Eve in Germany than previous years, two 18-year-olds died after suffering facial injuries in separate accidents involving homemade fireworks a western German city. DW has more.

Below is a roundup of the main headlines from Germany during the Christmas and New Year week:

New Year's celebrations across Germany were calmer than in previous years, but some festivities turned violent when revelers threw fireworks at police and emergency crews.

In Berlin, more than 400 people were briefly detained, and 21 officers suffered minor injuries after being struck with firecrackers and rockets.

Stephan Weh of the Berlin police union told public broadcaster ARD that although Berlin's hotspots were quieter this year, ""we cannot speak of a peaceful New Year's Eve."" Berlin police spokesman Florian Nath, told the dpa news agency there were no ""serious incidents or property damage like last year.""

In Hamburg, at least 10 police officers were injured and could not continue working.

Attacks on police officers with pyrotechnics were also reported in Bonn, Bremen and Leipzig, according to Deutschlandfunk.

Firefighters across Germany responded to numerous calls, including rubbish bins set alight in Leipzig's city center and several roof fires in Hagen in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

A fire in the roof of a historic building on the square in front of the cathedral in the central city of Erfurt spread to two adjacent houses. According to the fire brigade, a firework likely triggered the blaze.

Two 18-year-old men have died after suffering fatal facial injuries in separate accidents involving homemade fireworks in the western German city of Bielefeld, police said Thursday.

Both incidents happened on New Year's Eve at different locations in the city in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Police said one teenager died at the scene in the Baumheide district. The second victim was critically injured in the Brake district and later died in at the hospital despite resuscitation efforts.

The type of fireworks involved has not yet been disclosed.

Police said there were witnesses in both cases and no initial indications of third-party involvement.

Other serious fireworks-related injuries have been reported elsewhere in Germany.

A 23-year-old man lost his left hand near Rostock in northeastern Germany when a firecracker exploded, police said.

In Berlin, five people were admitted to the Berlin Accident Hospital with fireworks injuries by 10:30 pm on Wednesday, according to the hospital, with two seriously injured.

In Leipzig, police said a 16-year-old girl lost her little finger and part of her ring finger after trying to light illegal fireworks.

Two 18-year-old men died after being struck by homemade fireworks on New Year's Eve in the German city of Bielefeld, police said early Thursday.

The incidents occurred at separate locations in the city in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Both teenage victims suffered fatal facial injuries after igniting the homemade fireworks themselves, police said.

Authorities said, while investigations are ongoing, there was no initial indication of foul play or third-party involvement in either case.

After the Berlin state government pulled funding for Germany's traditional New Year's Eve extravaganza at the Brandenburg Gate, the iconic ZDF-Silvestershow has been swiftly moved to Hamburg.

Thousands of revelers braved drizzly skies and chilly 4-degree temperatures to pack into the HafenCity, Europe's largest inner-city urban development project, to welcome 2026.

Musical highlights include songs from the Michael Jackson Musical, UK boyband Blue and Michael Patrick Kelly, among many local artists.

A dazzling fireworks display is set to illuminate the Elbe River at midnight.

For decades, Berlin's Brandenburg Gate hosted Germany's biggest New Year's Eve party — a massive open-air event with live music, countdown and huge fireworks, televised nationally.

Due to budget cuts, the Berlin state government cut public funding, which previously reached up to €1 million ($1.17 million) annually, forcing the show's relocation to the northern port city.

Berlin will see in the New Year with a more intimate DJ party for 20,000 ticketed guests at the Brandenburg Gate and a smaller fireworks display.

Dozens of potential leads have been passed to police in Germany investigating last weekend's brazen €30 million ($35.2 million) bank heist in Gelsenkirchen.

A police spokeswoman said Wednesday that witnesses observed several men with large bags in the stairwell of a multi-storey car park on Saturday night.

The police said investigators were examining video footage from an adjacent car park showing masked persons and two vehicles.

Surveillance cameras, meanwhile, captured a black car and a white van that the perpetrators may have used.

Other footage published by German media outlets showed a masked man standing in front of a car park ticket machine.

The break-in, one of the largest in German history, was discovered by emergency services early on Monday morning when a fire alarm was set off.

The robbers apparently broke into a branch of the Sparkasse bank and then used a special drill to cut a large hole in the wall through to the vault.

From there, the thieves broke into almost all of the 3,250 safe deposit boxes, making off with the contents.

Tesla plans to increase production at its factory in Grünheide near Berlin in 2026, despite declining sales in Germany, plant manager André Thierig said.

In a recent interview with the dpa news agency, Thierig said output has already grown over the past four quarters.

""We are therefore looking forward to the new year with optimism and expect a further increase,"" he said, describing the current situation as ""stable.""

Thierig said Tesla's plans contrast with production stoppages and job cuts at German manufacturers like Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes as the domestic auto industry faces intense competition from China.

Elon Musk'selectric vehicle (EV) maker employs 11,000 people at its Gigafactory in the eastern state of Brandenburg, producing around 250,000 cars per year.

Tesla said earlier this month it plans to launch the production of complete battery cells at Grünheide from 2027.

Germany remains a tough market for Musk, with a near 50% drop in new Tesla EVs registered from January to November, compared with the same period in 2024.

Data from the Federal Motor Transport Authority shows that in the first 11 months of the year, 17358 new Tesla cars were registered.

According to dpa, Tesla supplies more than 30 markets from its German plant, including Canada.

Canadians can now order Teslas directly from Grünheide at a significantly lower price, rather than buying from the US and paying Canada's retaliatory 25% import duties on US-made cars in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Just two days after thousands of safe‑deposit boxes were looted at a bank in western Germany, details of another major theft have emerged at a different branch of the same financial institution.

This time, the heist involved a significant quantity of gold stolen from the Sparkasse KölnBonn branch in the center of Bonn.

According to the dpa news agency, a source indicated that an employee is suspected of having gained unauthorized access to safe‑deposit boxes at the Friedensplatz branch, before disappearing with their contents.

A Bonn police spokeswoman confirmed that authorities have been investigating the case for some time, though she declined to share further details.

Sparkasse KölnBonn acknowledged the theft, but neither the bank nor the police disclosed the value of the stolen gold.

How the employee allegedly accessed the boxes also remains unclear.

The case follows a major break‑in discovered on Monday at a Sparkasse branch in Gelsenkirchen, roughly 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Bonn.

In that incident, thieves used a specialized drill to penetrate the vault and subsequently forced open nearly all of the bank's 3,250 customer safe deposit boxes.

These days, it's not often that German railways and good news are mentioned in the same sentence. However, the country has seen a drop in luggage thefts at train stations and on trains this year.

According to Federal Police figures, nearly 16,891 cases were reported between January and October, down from over 20,000 during the same period last year.

Most of the thefts occurred at stations (8,450 cases), followed by regional trains (2,834 cases), high-speed trains (2,519 cases), and local transport (2,129 cases).

These statistics cover all railway companies and are based on police reports when offenses become known.

Full-year figures for 2025 are not yet available.

The German Police Trade Union (GdP) is warning of possible violence against emergency services during New Year's Eve celebrations.

Union chief Jochen Kopelke said the risk of attacks on police and rescue workers was ""very high"" and often unpredictable.

""The anonymity and the impression that one would not be held accountable for crimes on New Year's Eve tempt people to commit offenses,"" GdP federal chairman Jochen Kopelke told the dpa news agency.

In past years, officers have faced fireworks and ambushes in several cities.

Berlin is deploying this year 4,300 police officers, three times the usual number, alongside 1,600 fire brigade staff.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz began his first New Year's TV address to the nation with a callback to February 23 and the early election that led to the conservative becoming German chancellor, unseating Olaf Scholz and a Social Democrat-led government. 

""You, the citizens, decided on the political future of our country that day. A new Federal Government was formed that has set out to steer Germany in the right direction with determination and a clear sense of direction,"" Merz said in excerpts of the speech seen by DW.

Merz acknowledged that this goal is ""no small task.""

He said 2025 had presented Germany and the wider world with a series of major challenges. 

""A terrible war is raging in Europe, one that poses a direct threat to our freedom and our security. Our economy is coming under pressure from necessary reforms, high costs and global trade conflicts. Moreover, new technologies are revolutionising our world of work and the way we live together,"" Merz said. 

Against this backdrop, Merz said, his government saw its fundamental mandate as ""the renewal of the foundations of our freedom, our security and our prosperity.""

Düsseldorf police said they suspected a targeted attempted murder after several gunshots were fired at a taxi in the city center on Tuesday afternoon. 

Images from the scene showed a fairly small cluster of 10 bullets, all but one piercing the taxi's windshield on the passenger side. 

The man was struck by several bullets, and had been taken to hospital with severe wounds, police said. His precise condition was not clear. 

Other passengers were in the back of the taxi during the attack, but were not injured.

A large contingent of police officers mobilized to seal off the crime scene, a helicopter was deployed to assist with the search for a suspect. 

The vehicle was driving along a major four-lane road near tramlines, headed south, at the time of the attack. Police said that judging by the location of the shell casings recovered, the shooter or shooters must have been standing on or near the tramlines in the center of the road at the time of the attack. 

The background or potential motive for the attack were not yet clear, investigators said. 

The Bundeswehr on Tuesday said it was working on an action plan for its Fallschirmjägerregiment 26 paratrooper regiment based in Zweibrücken, after more news of longstanding investigations into several soldiers from the regiment came to light this week. 

A spokesman for the military at the Defense Ministry told the German epd news agency that the aim was to contribute to a new leadership culture in the regiment and to prevent such misconduct in the future, with focuses including leadership, education, prevention and resilience. 

A military spokeswoman meanwhile told the dpa news agency that three soldiers had been dismissed, 19 were suspended as the military sought their dismissal, and a total of 55 had been investigated in recent weeks on suspicion of various types of misconduct. 

Public prosecutors in Zweibrücken said they were investigating 19 members of the regiment on suspicion of criminal activity. 

The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported on Monday that at least 30 soldiers had been involved in a total of more than 200 instances of far-right or anti-semitic behavior. It said that Nazi salutes and a Nazi-themed party had taken place in the barracks among what it termed an extreme-right and antisemitic clique in the regiment. 

It also reported cases of sexist language and exhibitionism towards female soldiers, as well as narcotics abuse. 

News of the scandal first began to emerge earlier in the year, but with limited details amid ongoing investigations.

The regiment as a whole incorporates some 1,700 soldiers at a base near the French border and the city of Strasbourg. 

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has called reports published this week of rigth-wing extremism, sexism and drug abuse in a paratrooper regiment based in Zweibrücken in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate ""shocking."" 

Speaking to the German DPA news agency, Pistorius said the details first reported by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper were completely incompatible with the military's fundamental values. 

Pistorius noted how the military had since fired some soldiers and was seeking to dismiss others, with public prosecutors also investigating 19 suspects on possible criminal charges. But he said the reported behavior should have raised immediate red flags on site as well. 

""What's not right is that that misconduct was not immediately recognized as such on site and was not immediately met with the necessary consequences,"" Pistorius said. ""That is not acceptable."" 

The defense minister said that three steps should now follow: firstly the thorough investigation of the allegations, secondly appropriate consequences if further allegations solidify, and finally the restoration of trust in the military leadership on site in Zweibrücken in western Germany, near the French border and just north of Strasbourg.

Investigators have been piecing together how burglars drilled into a secure area from outside and ransacked thousands of safe-deposit boxes in Gelsenkirchen in western North Rhine-Westphalia state.

Police say the evidence points to a highly organized operation.Click here to find out more about what happened in the massive heist.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Six ways the 2026 World Cup will be different","https://www.dw.com/en/six-ways-the-2026-world-cup-will-be-different/a-75077593","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 02:39:27 GMT","

The United States is set to host the 2026 World Cup, along with Canada and Mexico. DW fills you in on why this tournament will be different than its predecessors.

Usually, the World Cup is an event hosted by a single nation, but this has not always been the case. The 2002 World Cup broke new ground when Japan and South Korea, two nations that have not always had an easy relationship, teamed up to host the tournament.

The 2026 World Cup goes one further, with three countries — the United States, Canada and Mexico — all hosting. While these countries have usually enjoyed good relations, US ties with Canada and Mexico have become strained since the start of President Donald Trump's second term in office.

Love it or hate it, the move to expand the World Cup from the previous 32 to 48 teams was a bold move by FIFA President Gianni Infantino. More teams mean many more games, a total of 104 compared to 64 at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

This also means there will be 12 groups of four teams, compared to eight four years ago. An extra knockout round — the Round of 32 — has also been introduced to help whittle down the number of teams on the way to the final in New Jersey on July 19. That will be played on the 39th day of the tournament, 10 more than it took to complete the 2022 World Cup.

While critics will argue that increasing the number of teams could lower the overall quality of play, it has helped some countries qualify for a first-ever World Cup. Cape Verde, Curacao, Jordan and Uzbekistan will be making their debuts on football's biggest stage. Of these, Curacao are the biggest underdogs, coming from a country with a population of under 160,000 and ranked number 82 in the world.

Several other first-timers have the chance to join via the qualifying playoffs in March — including North Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo and even New Caledonia.

This is not the first time a World Cup will be held over a large geographical area, but the distances that teams and fans will have to cover in 2026 will be a shock to the system after Qatar, which is smaller than Connecticut — the third-smallest state in the US. 

Farthest apart among the venues are Vancouver and Miami – 4,507 kilometers (2,800 miles). Germany stand to rack up 2,619 kilometers just to travel from Houston to Toronto to New Jersey for their group-stage matches — and that doesn't even take into account travel to and from their base camp, the location of which has yet to be announced.

While hydration breaks are not new to football, FIFA has announced that all matches at the 2026 World Cup will have two scheduled breaks — regardless of the weather conditions. Referees will be under instructions to halt games 22 minutes into each half so players can rehydrate, FIFA said in a statement.

Previously, referees were required to call cooling breaks 30 minutes into each half when the temperature at kickoff exceeded 31 degrees Celsius (87.8 degrees Fahrenheit).

The change comes amid concerns about high temperatures expected in some of the host cities, as was the case at last summer's Club World Cup in the US. FIFA has said it took this into account when determining kickoff times.

Two countries that have qualified for the World Cup, Iran and Haiti, are on a travel ban announced by Trump last June. As things stand, their fans won't be able to travel to the US to support their teams.

In December, Trump imposed partial travel restrictions on two other countries qualified for the tournament, Ivory Coast and Senegal. The teams themselves should have no trouble entering the US, though, as the Trump executive order makes exceptions for, among others, ""any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the secretary of state.""

Where the games will actually be played is also in some doubt, as Trump has repeatedly threatened to move World Cup matches away from Democratic-run cities for ""security"" reasons. During a meeting at the White House in November, FIFA head Infantino offered no push back: ""Safety and security is the No. 1 priority for a successful World Cup,"" he said.

			Kristi Noem's ‘brand is flying' as she clamps down on illegal immigration and presents a TV-friendly image

Kristi Noem has been in the firing line for the past month, the subject of intense scrutiny amid reports that Donald Trump is about to sack her as homeland security secretary.

But a new survey reveals that her high-profile role and made-for-TV approach have built popularity with US Republican voters.

When 1,500 people were asked to name the woman they would most like to see become president, she beat Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador, and Tulsi Gabbard, Mr Trump's director of national intelligence, for the top spot among Republicans.

When the results are arranged in a word cloud, they show Ms Noem in bold at the centre.

It puts ICE Barbie, nicknamed for her glamorous all-action approach to joining Immigration Customs Enforcement officials on operations, in a strong position to run for the Republican nomination in 2028.

On the other side, Kamala Harris, the former vice-president who lost to Mr Trump last year, is the number one choice of Democratic voters.

James Johnson, co-founder of JL Partners, which conducted the survey in December, said JD Vance, Mr Trump's vice-president, remained the frontrunner for the nomination, but Ms Noem had connected with the American public.

“It is quite a high bar for voters to mention a politician organically and Kristi Noem appears to have made a mark with Republican voters: the prominence of ICE, the success of the administration on immigration, and her TV-friendly image are all factors,” he said.

“What it means for 2028 is too early to say.

“JD Vance retains a rock-solid grip on the primary, but it certainly shows that Noem's brand is flying right now.”

Ms Noem emerged as a contender to be Mr Trump's 2024 running mate, when she was governor of South Dakota. But her chances evaporated when she revealed in her memoir that she had shot her dog Cricket for ruining a pheasant hunt and killing a neighbour's chickens.

However, her elevation to run the department of homeland security put her at the heart of the Trump administration, heading an agency central to the president's domestic agenda.

She has proved adept at the sort of headline-grabbing appearances that delight the US president and irritate his opponents.

She donned a leather aviator jacket aboard a Lockheed C-130 Hercules surveillance plane, paired bright pink lipstick with coastguard fatigues for a ride on a patrol boat, and posed in a firefighting uniform while dousing a blazing helicopter during a training exercise.

As Mr Trump's point person to lead the mass deportation of illegal immigrants, the 54-year-old has been one of the most visible members of the cabinet.

At the same time, there have been rumbles of discontent at her handling of the department. She has reportedly clashed with Tom Homan, the border tsar, and run afoul of Stephen Miller, one of the president's most powerful aides.

It led to rumours that she was on the way out despite a seal of approval from the US president himself.

Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and first-term Trump official, said she was intensely popular with the president's base.

“They love her,” he said.

“It's not just what you do, it's how you present it. And I think ... very similar to Karoline Levitt, she's just a very clean communicator. Unforgiving, if you will.”

He also mentioned Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the governor of Arkansas, as a strong candidate. Her name features on the fringes of the word cloud.

Other names brought up by Republican voters include Ms Haley. She broke decisively with Mr Trump after serving in his first administration, and was the last candidate standing against him during the nomination process in 2024.

She has backing from the moderate wing of the party, but is unpopular among Mr Trump's base.

Ms Gabbard is a third name highlighted in the word cloud. The former Democrat has not ruled out a run in 2028, despite only joining the Republican Party in 2024.

The picture is more clear-cut on the Democratic side. Ms Harris is head and shoulders above any other contender.

Despite losing in 2024, she benefits from strong name recognition and recently announced she was extending her book tour into 2026, triggering speculation that she was laying the groundwork for another run.

The next two names are Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama. They have both ruled out running.

The federal minimum wage has not risen since 2009.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Over a third of US states are set to raise their minimum hourly wage in 2026, but worker advocates including Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday decried a federal minimum wage that's remained at $7.25 since 2009 — and just $2.13 an hour for tipped workers for over three decades.

Minimum wage hikes are set to go into effect in 19 states on Thursday: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.

Increases range from 28 cents in Minnesota to $2 in Hawaii, with an average hike of 67 cents across all 19 states. More than 8.3 million workers will benefit from the increases, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI). The mean minimum wage in those 19 states will rise to $14.57 in 2026, up from $13.90 this year.

Three more states — Alaska, Florida, and Oregon — plus Washington, DC are scheduled to raise their minimum wages later in 2026.

In addition to the state hikes, nearly 50 counties and municipalities plan to raise their minimum wages in the coming year, according to the National Employment Law Project (NELP). These include San Diego, California — where the minimum wage for hospitality workers is set to rise to $25 an hour by 2030 — and Portland, Maine, where all workers will earn at least $19 by 2028.

However, the federal minimum wage remains at $7.25, and the subminimum rate for tipped workers is $2.13, where it's been since 1991 — and has lost more than half its purchasing power since then.

The federal minimum wage has stayed at $7.25 since 2009. In 2026, workers in 19 states and 49 cities and counties an increase. Alabama's rate will stay  at $7.25. 🔗 https://t.co/mrGfPAKba3 pic.twitter.com/EsokVIc6KP

“Tipped workers can still legally be paid as little as $2.13 an hour, a system advocates describe as a direct legacy of slavery,” the advocacy group One Fair Wage (OFW) said in a statement Tuesday.

Sanders (I-Vt.) said on social media on the eve of the hikes: “Congratulations to the 19 states raising the minimum wage in 2026. But let's be clear: A $7.25 federal minimum wage is a national disgrace. No one who works full time should live in poverty. We must keep fighting to guarantee all workers a living wage — not starvation wages.”

Yannet Lathrop, NELP's senior researcher and policy analyst, said earlier this month that “the upcoming minimum wage increases are incremental and won't magically turn severely underpaid jobs into living-wage jobs, but they do offer a bit of relief at a time when every dollar matters for people.”

“The bigger picture is that raising the minimum wage is just one piece of a much larger fight for a good jobs economy rooted in living wages and good benefits for every working person,” Lathrop added. “That's where we need to get to.”

Numerous experts note that neither $7.25, nor even $15 an hour, is a livable wage anywhere in the United States.

“The gap between wages and real living costs is stark,” OFW said. “According to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, there is no county in the United States where a worker can afford to meet basic needs on less than $25 an hour. Even in the nation's least expensive counties, a worker with one child would need at least $33 an hour to cover essentials like rent, food, childcare, and transportation.”

“Advocates argue that policies like President [Donald] Trump's ‘no tax on tips' proposal fail to address the underlying problem of poverty wages,” OFW continued. “While the policy has drawn attention, they say it is a headline rather than a solution, particularly since nearly two-thirds of tipped workers do not earn enough to owe federal income taxes.”

Frustrated by the long-unchanged $7.25 federal minimum wage, numerous states in recent years have let voters give themselves raises via ballot initiatives. Such measures have been successful even in some red states, including Missouri and Nebraska.

Rising minimum wages are a legacy of the union-backed #FightFor15 movement that began among striking fast-food workers in 2012. At least 20 states now have minimum wages of $15 or higher.

However, back then, “the buying power of a $15 minimum wage was substantially higher than it is today,” EPI noted. “In 2025, a $15 minimum wage does not achieve economic security for working people in most of the country. This is particularly true in the highest cost-of-living cities.”

In April, US senators voted down an amendment that would have raised the federal minimum wage to $17 an hour. Every Democratic and Independent upper chamber lawmaker voted in favor of the measure, while all Republicans except Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) rejected it.

As Trump administration and Republican policies and practices — such as passing healthcare legislation that does not include an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are set to expire on Wednesday and send premiums soaring — coupled with persistently high living costs squeeze workers, advocates say a living wage is more important than ever.

The issue is underscored by glaring income and wealth inequality in the US, as well as a roughly 285:1 CEO to worker pay gap among S&P 500 companies last year.

“Minimum wage doesn't cover the cost of living,” Janae van De Kerk, an organizer with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Airport Workers union and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport employee, said in a video posted Tuesday on social media.

""Minimum wage doesn't cover the cost of living. Many of my co-workers have to choose between food on the table or health insurance"" Janae, Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport service worker No one should have to make that choice.

“Many of my co-workers have to choose between food on the table or health insurance, or the choice between having food and paying the electric bill,” van De Kerk — who advocates a $25 hourly minimum wage — continued.

“We shouldn't have to worry about those things,” she added. “We shouldn't have to stress about those things. We're willing to work and we wanna work, and we should be paid for our work.”

As the new year approaches, Palestinians face new forms of colonization and new challenges to our rights and survival.

Today we have a so-called ceasefire that is killing Palestinians on a daily basis. When it comes to Israel, the word “ceasefire” simply means that Palestinians are not allowed to retaliate against Israeli airstrikes, shelling, artillery, bombs, house demolitions, or suicide drones. In reality, Israel can fire all it wants and has been doing so since the minute the agreement took effect. According to President Donald Trump, “nothing is going to jeopardize” the ceasefire in Gaza.The ceasefire, hailed as a success by the U.S. and the Western world, has done little to end the siege of Gaza and the deepening starvation and malnutrition of Palestinians, especially the children. And it is unlikely to usher in a pathway to freedom, equality, or self-determination for the Palestinian people in the foreseeable future.

The “ceasefire” is nothing but a cover for Israel's genocidal practices, supported by the U.S. and Western nations, and disguised by mainstream media. It is a deceptive appearance and a ploy that deflects criticism, allows the continued supply of U.S. weapons to Israel, shields the Israeli regime from accountability, disappears the Gaza genocide from the news, and enables Israel to continue the extermination and displacement of Palestinians.

Can We Stop Pretending There Is a Functioning “Ceasefire” in Gaza?

Since October 10, 2025, the day the ceasefire agreement between Hamas and the Israeli government went into effect, the Israeli military has killed nearly 400 Palestinians and injured over 1,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Under the ceasefire agreement, Israel is required to allow 600 trucks of aid and other goods into Gaza every day, but UN data show that Israel continues to block food aid, medical supplies, and tents in violation of the agreement.

Agnès Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement on November 27: “The ceasefire risks creating a dangerous illusion that life in Gaza is returning to normal … the world must not be fooled. Israel's genocide is not over.” 

According to the Gaza Health Ministry, the total death toll of Palestinians since October 7, 2023, is now 70,100, with 171,151 injured and many more buried under the rubble. The Israeli bombardment resulted in an estimated 50 million tons of rubble.

What the statistics don't reflect are the number of people in Gaza that were killed by Israel not through bombs and airstrikes, but through indirect means: Palestinians killed because of lack of shelter after Israel destroyed their homes; because of the destruction of their water supplies and desalination plants, electricity supplies, and sanitation systems; because of the flattening of clinics and hospitals; and because of starvation and diseases.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said shelter materials for 1.3 million people and about 5,000 trucks of emergency supplies remain stalled outside Gaza as Israel continues to block all UNRWA-associated goods from entering.

The Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem, who have endured 77 years of brutal Israeli military occupation and a system of apartheid that denies them their rights, are left with no choice other than to continue their struggle for liberation and against erasure and ethnic cleansing — including their right to armed resistance as recognized under international law.

UN Security Council Loses Sight of Its Mission and Betrays the Palestinians

On November 17, 2025, in an unexpected and disgraceful vote of 13-0 that is counter to the UN's raison d'être — with two abstentions from Russia and China — the UN Security Council (UNSC) adopted Resolution 2803, which embraces Trump's — or is it Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's? — “20-point peace plan,” effectively normalizing genocide, rewarding U.S. complicity, and establishing new colonial rule over the lives of 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza. It grants full control over Gaza to a U.S.-led “Board of Peace,” headed by Trump himself, that will oversee the administration and reconstruction of the Strip and establishes an “International Stabilization Force” in charge of security and disarming the resistance — not a UN peacekeeping force that will protect Palestinians.

Palestinians who have endured two years of genocide — and the total destruction of their homes and livelihoods — were not part of the negotiations and had no say in this matter.

The plan — hatched by the Trump-Netanyahu team and legitimized by the UNSC — includes no mention of the genocide and does not call for accountability for the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed over the last two years. This plan, which whitewashes the genocide, will never be forgotten or forgiven by any Palestinian. It denies Palestinians their humanity, their right to self-determination, and does nothing to address their grievances or root causes of their struggle. It will simply prolong the illegal occupation and will not advance peace or stability in the region in any meaningful way.Israel views the inclusion of language in the resolution about a “pathway to Palestinian statehood” as nonbinding. In fact, the day after the UNSC vote, Netanyahu publicly stated his strong opposition to a Palestinian state. Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir demanded that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas be imprisoned and other Palestinian Authority officials killed if the UN paved the way to Palestinian statehood.

Just like the Oslo Accords of 1993 that were supposed to bring about self-determination and statehood for the Palestinians, this plan is also doomed for failure. Instead of peace, the Oslo Accords entrenched Israeli control over the Palestinian occupied territories, expanded Israeli settlements, increased land theft by the Israeli state, and created a system of oppression that continues to dominate Palestinian lives.
After UNSC's Surrender to US and Israel, Is There Any Hope for Palestinians?

Just like the Oslo Accords of 1993 that were supposed to bring about self-determination and statehood for the Palestinians, this plan is also doomed for failure. Instead of peace, the Oslo Accords entrenched Israeli control over the Palestinian occupied territories, expanded Israeli settlements, increased land theft by the Israeli state, and created a system of oppression that continues to dominate Palestinian lives.

Across Palestine, oppression, displacement, and ethnic cleansing continue unabated. While the genocide was raging in Gaza, the West Bank saw large-scale assaults, house demolitions, armed settler rampages, and attacks on Palestinian communities resulting in the displacement of over 32,000 residents from their homes. During Operation Iron Wall, which began early in 2025, some 850 homes were demolished in the Jenin, Tulkarem, and Nur Shams refugee camps, resulting in “the largest displacement of Palestinians in one operation since the 1967 war,” according to a Human Rights Watch report released on November 20.

If there is to be hope for peace in the Middle East, we need to keep organizing for a permanent end to the genocide, the siege, and the current prevailing system of apartheid in Israel.

The UNSC vote was a major setback for the movement in solidarity with Palestine that saw tremendous global support and massive growth over the past couple of years. It shows that a lot more work is needed to make the movement broader and stronger in order to be better prepared for future challenges in the struggle for justice and liberation, especially as we are faced with the rise of authoritarianism and increased involvement of billionaires and war profiteers in politics and their influence over foreign and domestic policy. 

Over the past two years, the global movement for a free Palestine won the battle of public opinion, but little has changed in the positions of the political leadership in Washington. The movement has made great strides in educating people about the struggle and plight of the Palestinians and countering media bias, largely thanks to the fearless and unstoppable younger generation, including anti-Zionist Jews in the U.S. and elsewhere who reject the ideology of settler-colonialism, Jewish supremacy, genocide, and the premise that the Israeli government speaks in the name of all Jews around the world.

The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, commonly known as BDS, has been effective in its reach and in contributing to changes in policies of governments — from Spain to Turkey, from Malaysia to Colombia, from Slovenia to Norway and elsewhere — putting pressure on corporations and institutions complicit in the genocide and Israeli apartheid. Their sustained pressure has had a great impact, isolating the Israeli regime globally and hurting those corporations complicit in its crimes.

BDS has had many significant divestment achievements during the past two years. Those who divested from companies linked to Israel include leading European pension funds such as Denmark's public pension fund; church groups, including Presbyterian Church (U.S.A), the United Methodist Church, and the United Church of Christ; universities such as San Francisco State University, Union Theological Seminary, University of California, Davis, and others. Internationally, Radboud University, Utrecht University, University of Amsterdam, and Trinity College Dublin, to name a few, have ended ties with Israeli academic institutions.

Many Palestine advocates felt naively optimistic when the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued its advisory opinion on July 19, 2024, concluding that “the State of Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful” and that “Israel is under an obligation to bring to an end its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible.” The resolution that followed and was adopted by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) on September 18, 2024, ordered Israel to dismantle its system of apartheid within 12 months. Instead, Israel's system of apartheid is worse than ever before.

But regardless, the significance of the UNGA resolution; the ICJ findings; the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes; the recognition of the State of Palestine by the vast majority of UN member countries (157 nations, including France, Britain, and Canada); the isolation of Israel and the U.S.; the extensive reports of human rights organizations that detail Israeli apartheid; and the unprecedented and growing global movement offers Palestinians some hope of a new period of transformative changes in the struggle for Palestinian rights.

In another demonstration of the U.S. and Israel's isolation, on November 23, 2025, the U.S., Israel, and Argentina were the only three countries to vote against a UN General Assembly resolution condemning torture, which was supported by 169 nations.

Let us keep reminding U.S. taxpayers that they are the ones footing the bill for the bombs, missiles, and weapons used by the Israeli military to kill Palestinian families and maim Palestinian children.

In spite of all these gains, we have seen the U.S. deliver some $21.7 billion worth of weapons and military aid to Israel since October 7, 2023. We have also witnessed severe repression of anti-genocide protests; numerous arrests of pro-Palestinian student activists; the silencing of dissent and violent removal of peaceful student encampments on university campuses; the erosion of academic freedom; weaponization of antisemitism; threats of university federal funding cuts; and federal kidnappings of pro-Palestinian writers, academics, and activists. Many colleges, universities, states, and countries have enacted policies that stifle pro-Palestinian activism.

What Can Palestine Advocates Do to Advance the Cause of Freedom and Equality for All?

If there is to be hope for peace in the Middle East, we need to keep organizing for a permanent end to the genocide, the siege, and the current prevailing system of apartheid in Israel. We need to increase our efforts and move into a proactive and shared commitment to keep raising our voices and educating about Palestine in order to dismantle the oppressive system and end the denial of Palestinian rights. We also need to uplift Palestinian voices so the world can hear their stories, testimonies, and lived experiences.

Activists during the civil rights movement, the anti-Vietnam War movement, and the movement against South African apartheid succeeded by using a variety of tactics to bring about changes in government policies: mass demonstrations, marches on Washington, and uprisings; student protests on university campuses; labor movement protests and strikes; grassroots organizing; pressuring Congress through lobbying; and boycotts and divestments. The movement for Palestinian freedom and equality is no different.

Let us keep reminding U.S. taxpayers that they are the ones footing the bill for the bombs, missiles, and weapons used by the Israeli military to kill Palestinian families and maim Palestinian children — funds that could otherwise be used for improving health care and education. And above all, let us make sure that Netanyahu's campaign for a massive increase in U.S. aid to Israel does not succeed. Israel will be making the case for a 20-year U.S. commitment that will top the $3.8 billion the U.S. already sends Israel every year.

All this will depend in part on the ability of advocates for Palestine to put pressure on representatives in Congress to push for an arms embargo to halt U.S. weapons to Israel and support proposals such as the “Block the Bombs Act.”

Other actions include getting local governments to divest from companies complicit in genocide and apartheid, and electing representatives who cannot be bought by AIPAC and those capable of shifting the political calculus around U.S. support for Israel — financial, military, and diplomatic. We've seen it happen in New York City — the city with the U.S.'s largest Jewish population and the world's second-largest Jewish population after Tel Aviv — with the election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor.

The suffering in Gaza demands we all face a vital question: What kind of future do we want for ourselves, and for our children and grandchildren, and are we willing to fight for it?

Today, polls show that most people in the U.S. agree that their government shouldn't be funding Israel. This marked transformation set the stage for Mamdani's historic win in New York City and proves that support for Palestinian rights is good politics.

Christian faith leaders were instrumental in the civil rights movement, the anti-Vietnam War movement, and the boycotts that ended apartheid in South Africa. And yet today, most — especially Christian evangelicals — seem largely silent. Christian Zionists believe that the return of Jews to the Holy Land and the founding of Israel in 1948 was a fulfillment of biblical prophecy, viewing it as a prerequisite for the Second Coming of Christ. This belief translates into unwavering political, religious, and financial support for the Israeli state and is the movement's greatest challenge: how to get concerned congregants to demand their leaders speak up against genocide.

While the atrocities in Gaza have had a devastating impact on Palestinian lives and livelihood, Gaza has also shattered the myth of Israeli military prowess and its ability to conquer and eliminate any Palestinian resistance with its advanced weaponry and high-tech surveillance.

Contrary to Israeli ethnic cleansing plans, designs for a Greater Israel, and efforts at Palestinian erasure, Palestinians refuse to be uprooted from their homeland no matter the cost. The approximately 15 million Palestinians in the world — 6 million in occupied Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem; around 2 million in Israel; and 7 million in the diaspora — aren't going away. Their struggle for freedom and equality will continue undeterred.

Palestine does not belong to those who are intent on ethnically cleansing its Indigenous inhabitants — and it most certainly does not belong to Donald Trump or the “Board of Peace.” Try as they might, Gaza is not available for takeover or colonization by the U.S.

An excerpt from a poem by Gaza poet Nour Abdel Latif titled “Buried Truths, Rising Voices” sums up the feelings of every Palestinian:

But a voice born of truth  is never laid to rest. It lingers —   in the dust, in the wind,  in every heartbeat that dares to remember. One day, it will rise again —   not as a whisper,  but as a storm.

Palestine has become a footprint and a guiding light for liberation movements around the world. It shows us that our struggles are interwoven and that our actions are most effective when we are united in fighting for change.

Around the world, when people protest and march in the streets demanding a free Palestine, they are at the same time also marching for climate justice, the right of all colonized peoples to resist their occupiers, and numerous other causes. They are marching against apartheid, militarism, empire, and fascism. They are demanding compliance with international law.

For us in the U.S., fighting for Palestinian rights is also fighting for our rights and against authoritarianism: fighting for our right to speak up, to protest, to have a free press and not to be silenced, censored, or kidnapped because of our political beliefs.

Palestine is also our future. The suffering in Gaza demands we all face a vital question: What kind of future do we want for ourselves, and for our children and grandchildren, and are we willing to fight for it? Do we speak up and act together for change, or will we let Israel and the U.S. slide the world into an abyss of hatred and endless wars?

Trumpism has been aided by divestment that hollowed higher ed out from the core, AAUP President Todd Wolfson says.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

The United States is on the road to a form of neofascism that, if allowed to complete its course, will have long-lasting impacts on all aspects of society. Indeed, the Trump administration is carrying out a series of policies that target the very foundations of a free and open society — including an unrelenting assault on higher education and the U.S. education system in general. Higher education in particular seeks to nurture an environment that fosters independent thought, promotes thinking skills critical for democracy, and encourages inquisitive assessment of evidence for the purpose of promoting and disseminating the truth. At least, this has been the historical mission of universities, which is why they have always been targeted by reactionary forces with the intent of transforming them into pure ideological apparatuses of the fascist state. Following this pattern, Donald Trump has sought to bend universities to his will by cutting funding and forcing them to pledge support to his administration's initiatives for reshaping higher education by signing a Compact for Academic Excellence that basically erodes institutional independence.

How successful has Trump's fascist takeover of higher education been so far? How are universities responding? In the exclusive interview for Truthout that follows, Todd Wolfson, the president of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), offers insights on the battle for the soul of American higher education in the age of Trumpism. Wolfson is an associate professor of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University.

C. J. Polychroniou: Trump's reactionary agenda has spread across all aspects of U.S. society, including politics, economics, societal norms, culture, and the environment. His culture war tactics extend to reshaping higher education, which he claimed in a recent Truth Social post “has lost its way, and is now corrupting our Youth and Society with WOKE, SOCIALIST, and ANTI-AMERICAN ideology.” Now, it is not common for U.S. presidents to dictate what colleges and universities teach and whom they hire, so Trump's assault on higher education is a clear indication that the country is descending into fascism. What sense do you make out of Trump's crackdown on higher education, which he has tried to justify mainly as a response to antisemitism on campuses? Is it just because he perceives universities as having become too liberal or progressive? Or is there some deeper motive behind his neofascist actions?   

Todd Wolfson: I would say that Trump's attack on higher education is being driven by a couple of different ideological and material forces. First and foremost, authoritarian and fascist regimes historically have targeted various sectors of society. If we look at fascist Spain, fascist Italy, or Nazi Germany, or if we look at Victor Orbán's Hungary and his fascist or illiberal regime, what we see are three sectors that are clearly always identified and targeted. One is the press, one is the court system, and the third is higher education. Higher ed is targeted because it's an independent political force that has a critical role in the ideological formation of society and poses a threat to fascist or authoritarian ideology. So at one level, it's true. This is a very old playbook that the Trump regime is using. 

Another issue, in the American context, is that white voters — the Republican base — are more likely to vote Democrat if they go to college. So, in undermining college and making it so that less people attend, they are protecting their own ability to win elections. I think that's also in play. And a corollary, and this is in Project 2025, is the desire of some aspects of white nationalists to have higher birth rates in white communities in the U.S. Project 2025 outlines how white women with a college degree are likely to have less children than white women without a college degree, so once again, this plays into their white replacement theory. 

So I think all of those are reasons why the Trump administration has targeted and zeroed in on higher ed. And then there's things like the protests on Gaza. Historically, college campuses are places where students protest and build power and force societies to look at themselves in the mirror. Great social change often comes from the leadership of young people, so they're trying to crush dissent and campus protest, so that's another aspect of this. There are probably many other reasons as well, but I think those are some reasons why the Trump administration has zeroed in on higher education. 

It's also important to note that this agenda has been in the works for decades. In the '60s, Black Americans start getting broad access to free or highly subsidized public higher education, in particular the CUNY system in New York City and the University of California system were both free in the '60s, and people of color were getting access to that free higher ed. American campuses were critical to, what we would call the long '60s, the tumultuous '60s, the effervescent '60s, where we had the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement, the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, the Black Panther Party. These movements were anchored and organized in many ways by college kids. So that happens in the '60s and fast forward, Ronald Reagan is running for a second term as governor in 1970 and he targets higher ed. He targets Berkeley, and his education advisor Roger A. Freeman says publicly, “We are in danger of producing an educated proletariat. That's dynamite! We have to be selective on who we allow [to go to college].” 

So, Reagan runs on a campaign on clamping down on the University of California and then starts introducing fees to that system, which was free beforehand. That opens the floodgates for the divestment that takes place across the next 50 years that we've witnessed. So, this started in California and it started in response to who was going to college and what was happening on our college campuses. Divestment from higher ed was politicized and racialized from the beginning. 

The last thing I'll say here is that it's not just Reagan. That's not the only line. Lewis Powell became a Supreme Court justice in 1972, but before that he wrote the Powell memo for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and in that memo, he outlines why campuses are the biggest threat to a free market society and pressed for divestment, among other things. So the divestment from American higher education that has happened over the last half century was a political strategy from the right that led to a number of horrible outcomes, skyrocketing tuition, ballooning student debt, a near-complete reliance on contingent labor, and a growing army of bureaucrats that run our institutions more like businesses and less like higher education institutions. That divestment hollowed higher ed out from the core. It started from a right-wing position that has aided and embedded the fascist attacks on our institutions that we see today. 

Stopping federal grants is one of the key tools that the Trump administration is using to force institutions of higher education to kneel to its ideology. Isn't this a violation of constitutional principles since the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse? How much federal funding do so-called private colleges and universities receive to the point that it makes them so vulnerable to government threats?      

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of this question. I do think the attacks on funding and biomedical research have been unconstitutional, but not in the way you outline it here, because there is a role for federal governments to play in making sure that there's compliance with public and private institutions around core values. The Office of Civil Rights, which emerged on the heels of the civil rights movement, was put in place to make sure that racism did not take place on our campuses, and that grant programs and institutions adhered to a non-racist approach to higher education, and that there was a process in place for instances when they don't. That is a federal government role. 

When we talk about Trump going to the University of California or Harvard and threatening to freeze their money by alleging they have an antisemitism problem, I don't know if it's a constitutional problem in relationship to the power of the purse in Congress. It is a constitutional problem, as we've shown in court twice now, because it undermines our freedom of speech rights on our campuses. It's also a problem because the Trump administration has not followed the procedures and rules of the Office of Civil Rights and title VI. So, if you want to prove that there's an antisemitism problem and it's connected to a grant, you have to go through a process and you have to make a case, and they haven't done that at all, so we sued them twice. 

We won twice in court with the Harvard and University of California cases. Basically, our argument was that you cannot freeze grants that are doing research on cancer because you're making an unverified claim that there's rampant structural antisemitism at an institution, you must prove it. They never proved it. So, the violation is with the First Amendment, but that said, it's a terrible problem, and one that the AAUP is committed to combating and we've been successful. 

At UCLA, the Trump administration froze a billion dollars. We sued. (The University of California was cowardly and did not sue and is still negotiating with the Trump administration.) Every union representing workers in the UC system signed on to the lawsuit. Combined, this represents over 100,000 workers, and we won that case. Now, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant money that was frozen by the Trump administration is flowing back into the university and it's flowing because workers stood up when the administration failed to. That's going to be a boon to the economy of California and a boon to the research infrastructure of this country. When people need to go see a doctor or have, say, Alzheimer's therapy, it's there because we fought to get the NIH grant that was funding the Alzheimer's lab and doing the research that your mother needed in order to get the therapy. So we were going to fight them on every inch here. 

Some universities have indeed capitulated to Trump's fascist demands for higher education, but there are a few that are balking at the idea of surrendering their independence. Can you give us an overall assessment of the way universities are responding to the Trump administration's war on higher education? Can you also explain why some of the nation's most powerful universities seem to have sworn oath to a wannabe dictator? 

Our universities and administrators have not covered themselves in glory during this moment. Very few have. When universities stand up, it's usually because faculty, students, staff, unions and organizations that represent them, like the AAUP, have stood up first, and then they followed suit. 

Let's talk about the Trump administration's “loyalty oath” compact for higher ed. Billionaire Marc Rowan, CEO of Apollo Global Management Group, wrote a compact, or co-wrote it, that was the greatest threat to the autonomy of higher education in the history of this country. They then invited nine universities to join that compact. Two days after that compact became public, and we knew the nine universities that were invited, the AAUP, along with students groups like Students Rise Up, and some of our union partners, like AFT, organized meetings with members across the nine universities, and within a week, we were organizing actions and teach-ins on all nine campuses. On October 17, about two weeks after the compact was announced, we had a national day of action throughout the country and on the heels of that, universities started rejecting the compact. What's important to emphasize here is that students, faculty, and staff, not administrators, stood up first and stood up most vehemently and forced administrators to respond to the Trump administration's attack on our autonomy. 

The Trump administration demanded that the nine initial universities sign on by November 21. By early November, we had gotten seven of the universities to publicly reject the compact because of our organizing. The last two, the University of Texas at Austin and Vanderbilt, just never signed on. They never publicly rejected it, but they never signed on. So, no, I don't think there are many institutions standing up, including Harvard. But when they do, they fight back because we fought back first. Even in the case of Harvard, we sued the Trump administration over the Harvard demand letter first, and a couple days later, Harvard filed a lawsuit of their own that was joined together by the First Circuit Court. Our broad coalition of students, faculty, and staff are leading this fight. We have not seen many of these administrators or presidents fighting back, in a way we need to see them fight back. 

Specifically, how is the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) challenging Trump's assault on academic freedom?  

We're approaching his assault writ large. We're fighting on four levels in response to Trump and I'll explain how academic freedom fits in. The first and most important level is organizing and building power on our campuses. Nothing else matters if we do not build an army of higher ed workers aligned with students to build power at the campus level, the state level and the federal level, not only to respond to Trump's attacks, but to also then pivot and go on the offensive and redefine higher education for this country. That's the most fundamental: organizing and building power, and building coalitions in alliance, with alumni, workers, and other key sectors of society. That's the first and primary area of work. The second area of work, as we already discussed, is legal. We sued the Trump administration about eight times. We've been very successful in court. We're using the court strategically in order to slow the Trump administration's assault on higher ed. The third place we're fighting them is politically. We're in the process of talking with our members and other higher ed workers throughout the country and plan to come out with our vision for the future of higher education in the spring of 2026. 

“We sued the Trump administration about eight times…. We're using the court strategically in order to slow the Trump administration's assault on higher ed.” 

What is emerging is a call for free, public higher ed college for all. It's going to entail an end to student debt and skyrocketing tuition. It's going to entail an end to contingency and demanding work with dignity on our campuses. And it's going to entail a fully funded biomedical research infrastructure and a fully funded HBCU, minority serving institution system, and most critically to this, it will include a new academic compact between the federal government, state governments, and our universities that enshrines real academic freedom, real freedom of speech and freedom of protest on campuses, and that enshrines true shared governance between faculty, students, staff, and administrations.

What we've seen in this period is that we're the only ones that can actually set direction for our institutions. Our administrators have failed so we're going to come out with our agenda, and we're going to make it political, and we're going to fight to win that agenda legislatively. We're going to fight to win that agenda by electing people to office who carry that agenda in the midterms, in 2026, and every election thereafter. 

On the fourth level, we must challenge the false narrative put forth by the Trump administration on higher ed and emphasize why higher ed is critical to our society and to the future of this country. Higher education is critical to democracy, our economy, and our children's ability to get a leg up in this world. We have to make this case to the U.S. populace. 

It appears, without a doubt, that Trump's actions have also laid bare the long-standing crisis in higher education in the United States, which is attributed to a very large degree to neoliberalism's policy agenda. Indeed, among other things, the implementation of neoliberal practices has paved the way to systematic privatization of public education, treating students as customers, and to a highly bureaucratic form of governance marked by top-down decision making that sidelines faculty. First, do you agree with this assessment of the state of U.S. higher education today and, second, what is, in your view, its future?   

Yes, I agree. I think we laid out our assessment of higher education previously so I'm not going to go back into it, but clearly, the neoliberalization and corporatization of the university is the fundamental crisis that's taken place in higher education over the last 60 years that has aided and embedded the fascist attack on higher ed that we're witnessing now from the Trump administration.

“We need a free public higher education system, and we need that system rooted in dignity for the workers on our campuses.”  

Higher education is a foundation of a democratic, multiracial society. That's what we want to build, and that's the higher education system that we are fighting for. That means to us, kids are able to go to college without being saddled with life-altering debt. Like almost every industrialized nation in the world right now, we want free public higher education. Kids should not have to go into debt to become the next teacher in our neighborhood school, or the next doctor or lawyer or any other number of important careers. We need a free public higher education system, and we need that system rooted in dignity for the workers on our campuses. 

We must put an end to the degraded worker contracts and the contingency and the corporatization of the sector. We really need a higher ed system that's not just rooted in students as customers, but is rooted in critical inquiry and the development of smart, thoughtful citizens in a democracy who can see through the lies and stand up for the kind of society we want to build. That cannot happen without a strong, vibrant, free, autonomous higher ed system. That's the vision we are fighting for.

 Where Will the Island's Crisis End?

 Michael J. Bustamante

In 2014, after the Obama administration and Cuba's government announced an agreement to restore diplomatic ties, the world descended on Havana. Everyone from the Rolling Stones to would-be investors rushed to claim a stake in the island's future. Raúl Castro, the long-serving minister of defense, had assumed power from his ailing elder brother Fidel several years earlier and launched moderate economic reforms: allowing for more small private businesses, loosening rules for foreign investments, and downsizing the state's payroll. Together, the normalization of relations with the United States and the government's internal actualización (or “updating,” per the Cuban Communist Party's preferred euphemism) seemed poised to help bring the island into the twenty-first century.

Unfortunately, Cuba has fallen dramatically short of those expectations. In the last five years, well over a million people—more than one in every ten Cubans—have fled the country, mostly for the United States. Today, under President Miguel Díaz-Canel, the island is enduring its worst economic crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union. GDP has declined 11 percent since 2020. The electric grid is falling apart. Security forces harshly repress antigovernment protests. In October, Hurricane Melissa devastated the island's east, damaging or destroying some 90,000 homes and 250,000 acres of farmland. Now, an outbreak of dengue and other mosquito-borne viruses has reached epidemic proportions.

Cuba's unfolding tragedy is partly the result of external shocks, such as U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election. After taking office, Trump reinstated many of the sanctions his predecessor had lifted. Between 2019 and 2020, for instance, he sharply restricted flights, remittances, and travel to the island, and in 2021, he redesignated Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, mainly for harboring a handful of fugitives from U.S. justice. U.S. President Joe Biden only partially loosened these restrictions, and Trump has reinstated some of them in his second term. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic shattered the island's tourism industry. And with the second Trump administration mounting an increasingly aggressive pressure campaign to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, an already sharp reduction in oil aid from Caracas to Havana in recent years threatens to get worse, and Cuba risks losing its most important economic and geopolitical partner.

But the current emergency is also a mess of the Cuban government's making. Despite Raúl's reforms, authorities have been unwilling to break decisively from the country's sclerotic central planning model. Additional private-sector expansions have been fitful, and bad monetary policy has contributed to severe inflation. The government has, likewise, been averse to any meaningful change to the island's one-party system. As a result, the island's economy remains fragile and unresponsive, and past excitement in Washington for greater engagement with Havana has been replaced by skepticism, hostility, or disinterest.

It is hard to be hopeful about Cuba's future. Raúl, who is 94 and still plays the role of éminence grise, will die soon, along with the last of the generation that forged the 1959 Cuban Revolution. But to get out of the current quagmire, a new generation of leaders would have to seriously commit, at a minimum, to deeper economic liberalization—painful as it might be in the short term. To fully set the country on the right path, they would need to democratize as well. Sadly, after a decade of policy tinkering, Cuba's current leadership has given few signs that it is ready to tackle the island's challenges head on or cede control to those who could.

“We reform, or we sink,” declared Raúl in 2010, four years after assuming power. Cuba's socialist system had survived the immediate post-Soviet period, when aid to the island plummeted and its GDP shrank by a third. But it had only partially recovered from the contraction. To put the economy on firmer footing, Raúl devised a straightforward plan: shrink a bloated state by laying off half a million workers while expanding a tiny private sector of “self-employed” workers running restaurants, homestays, and other small businesses. Authorities would allow foreign investors to hold majority stakes in ventures, and the state would turn over fallow public lands to private farmers to address the country's dependence on imports for 70 percent of the country's food.

Cuba's best economists quickly pointed out the plan's flaws. The list of 200-plus activities authorized for self-employment was comically micromanaged. Farming a plot of public land and selling most of the harvest in a price-controlled ration system, for example, is not the same as owning property and selling the resulting produce in a market. And state companies still maintained an unfair edge by being allowed to treat one Cuban peso as the equivalent of one dollar, thus artificially overvaluing their assets and lowering the cost of their imports. Private citizens, by contrast, could sell pesos to Cuban state banks for dollars at a rate of 24 to one. Still, many people remained optimistic. To visit Cuba in these years was to feel the winds of change as small businesses opened, tourists from Canada and Europe arrived in droves, and a zone of tolerance expanded for independent journalism, academic analysis, and civic debate.

U.S. President Barack Obama took notice. Even before the normalization breakthrough in late 2014, his administration authorized Americans to travel in group tours to the island if they wished to “support the Cuban people.” Members of the Cuban diaspora visited family and brought in millions of dollars in remittances, providing seed capital for small businesses. After the countries formally restored ties, airlines established direct commercial flights between them. There were cruises, self-guided visits, and new foreign investment exceptions to the long-standing embargo on U.S.-Cuban trade. In 2016, more than 580,000 U.S. and Cuban passport holders (in other words, Cuban Americans) boarded island-bound flights from Miami International Airport alone.

Yet for all the excitement, it quickly became clear that Havana was not prepared to seize the moment. U.S. investors found Cuban authorities wedded to preapproved projects, leading to few commercial deals of consequence. Hard-liners in the Cuban government bristled at Obama's hopeful rhetoric, decrying it as a Trojan horse that would bring unwelcome political change. Calls for deepening market reforms went unheeded as party leaders feared unleashing economic forces that they could not control.

As a result of Cuba's shortsightedness, after the 2016 U.S. election, there was little to stop the Trump administration from reversing course. And sure enough, six months into his first term, Trump declared that he was “canceling” Obama's “one-sided Cuba deal.” Cruise ships carrying U.S. tour groups continued to land at Cuban docks, but the Trump administration barred Americans from taking self-guided trips or from staying in Cuba's many military-owned hotels. Soon after, news organizations began reporting on mysterious health incidents afflicting U.S. diplomats on the island, which was dubbed “Havana syndrome.” In response, Washington closed the U.S. consulate and effectively halted legal Cuban migration to the United States.

In 2019, U.S. policy took an even more punitive turn. That year, Trump eliminated the general license for “people-to-people” group travel that fueled the remaining American visits to the island and capped Cuban American remittances to $1,000 a quarter. His administration also activated the long-dormant Title III of the Helms-Burton Act of 1996, allowing U.S. citizens to sue American and non-American companies for “trafficking” in property the Cuban government confiscated in the early 1960s, which had the effect of immediately chilling foreign investment to the island. In early 2020, the White House barred flights to or from Cuban cities other than Havana, and it blocked the U.S. financial services company Western Union from partnering with a financial entity owned by the Cuban military for remittance forwarding. Ignoring the humanitarian consequences, officials billed these measures as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign on both Cuba and Venezuela. That same campaign included sanctions on Venezuelan oil shipping—which tightened crucial energy supplies to the island.

Then the pandemic hit. Tourism vanished, and Cuba's GDP plummeted ten percent. This was a trial by fire for Cuba's first non-Castro leader, Díaz-Canel, whom Raúl tapped as his successor in 2018. But Díaz-Canel responded to mounting economic difficulties by doubling down on state economic control, such as by freezing new self-employment licenses for over a year. As the state's hard-currency earnings dwindled, his government sought to capture more remittances by launching state-run stores selling imported goods in a new digital-only currency—the “Freely Convertible Currency” (known by its Spanish abbreviation, MLC)—pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. It was not freely convertible at all. Dollars deposited in so-called MLC accounts could not be reclaimed, further segmenting Cuban currency markets.



Díaz-Canel and his inner circle did eventually realize that this approach was not working. And in the summer of 2020, they announced a new strategy to handle the escalating economic emergency. Rather than enforce a narrow list of approved activities for the private sector, authorities adopted a list of prohibited activities, allowing everything else. The government also committed to legalizing small and medium-size private enterprises, moving beyond the “self-employment” framework. Finally, authorities agreed to unify the island's multiple currencies and exchange rates. The separate exchange rates for private citizens and state companies had helped shield the state from the shock of the post-Soviet crisis, but they also introduced severe distortions into public companies' accounting, worsening import reliance over time.

Yet the execution and sequencing of these reforms proved disastrous. Instead of first expanding the private sector, authorities launched their “monetary reorganization” plan on its own, unifying exchange rates across the economy at 24 pesos to the dollar in early 2021. For state-owned businesses used to operating at a one-to-one rate, this devaluation put upward pressure on prices for imported goods. A simultaneous increase in state salaries fueled further inflation, as too many pesos chased too few products. The printing of currency to finance soaring fiscal deficits made things even worse. The state also continued selling imports in its dollar-pegged digital currency, undermining the logic of currency unification and increasing demand for dollars, which the government did not have enough of. An informal currency market boomed, and by the end of 2021, the value of the Cuban peso had dropped by 75 percent, trading at 100 to the dollar even though the official rate remained 24 to one.

The result was a growing crisis in the state's political legitimacy. This was most apparent when Cuba's luck against COVID-19 ran out in the summer of 2021, and the delta variant of the virus tore through the country. Images of collapsing hospitals and dead bodies spread online. Fueled by the viral protest anthem “Patria y Vida” (“Homeland and Life”) by popular hip-hop and reggaetón artists and the power of livestreaming, Cubans in more than 50 cities and towns took to the streets on July 11, 2021, demanding food, medicine, and liberty. The government responded that very same day with repression that sent protesters to jail or back to their homes. More than a thousand were eventually arrested, and several hundred were sentenced to lengthy terms for crimes such as vandalism, public disorder, and sedition.

For the first seven months of its tenure, the Biden administration ignored Cuba, leaving Trump's sanctions in place. But the protests and their aftermath forced Washington to take notice. Three months after the demonstrations, Cuba lifted its final COVID travel restrictions to restart tourism. Then Nicaragua, a close ally of Havana, allowed Cubans visa-free entry, providing a shorter, if still dangerous, route to the U.S.-Mexico border. Flights to Managua soon topped $2,000, but that did not stop Cubans from fleeing to the United States. Cuba appeared to be deliberately exporting dissent, thus giving Washington political headaches. The Biden administration responded by restoring remittance processing, resuming flights to Cuban provincial cities (which are largely used by the diaspora), and reopening preexisting legal avenues for migration and creating new ones—all in a bid to restore a modicum of economic stability and slow the exodus. But these efforts were unsuccessful. By the fall of 2024, more than 850,000 Cubans had entered the United States, including through a new “advanced humanitarian parole” program that the Biden administration created.

At the same time, Cuba's government was also making a new attempt to help the economy. In late 2021, authorities finally legalized private enterprises with up to 100 employees. Over three years, more than 10,000 such businesses were approved. And for the first time since the early years of the Cuban Revolution, they received permission to import goods from abroad, albeit through state intermediaries. Entrepreneurs who had built international and diaspora contacts during the Obama period opened private grocery stores. Others imported wholesale from Mexico, Panama, or even the United States. Supply chain companies such as Supermarket23 provided Cubans abroad with an Amazon-like online platform to purchase goods for their families from local importers, as well as warehouses and logistics on the ground, facilitating door-to-door delivery. All of this was once unthinkable. By the end of 2024, the private sector accounted for 23 percent of tax receipts, 31 percent of the labor force, and over half of retail sales, outstripping state-owned enterprises.

But several problems beset the sector. One was the lack of a stable exchange market or any other legal way to move foreign currency abroad. This forced private firms into the informal currency market, driving the peso to new lows: over 400 pesos to the dollar, at present. This exchange rate has put many goods out of reach for many Cubans who are still reliant on state pensions or salaries and have little access to remittances. As a result, although new private businesses have been crucial for providing Cuban families with basic necessities in the last few years, they have become the public face of rising inequality—a political challenge for a still self-described socialist state.

And even this limited privatization has faced setbacks. Over the last two years, the government imposed new banking transaction limitations, removed tax incentives for new companies, and temporarily restricted wholesale operations. Company owners or partners must now reside in Cuba most of the year, limiting the legal involvement of the Cuban diaspora, a heretofore primary source of seed capital, knowhow, and access to non-sanctioned financial services. Observers widely interpret these moves as an attempt by the military's business conglomerate, the Grupo de Administración Empresarial S.A. (GAESA), to gain market share in the selling of marked-up foreign products, which it had dominated before the pandemic. Authorities still insist that private firms should be “complementary actors” in the economy, not the motors, even as dozens of state companies are operating at a loss.

Cuba's cascading problems are now so severe that even a more dynamic private sector would be insufficient to fix them. A nationwide blackout in September was the fifth in a year. Overhauling the aging, oil-dependent power grid would cost billions that the government does not have and that no country is willing to lend. The productivity effects are devastating. Authorities recently acknowledged that output in agriculture, livestock, and mining has declined 53 percent since 2019. Yet over the last decade, more of the state's investment budget (38 percent) has gone to hotels and tourism facilities—which are also dominated by GAESA—than any other sector, despite the fact that visitor numbers are barely half what they were at the pre-pandemic peak. Tourists of all kinds are choosing Caribbean destinations that are less blackout prone. European tourists are choosing ones that won't jeopardize their normal 90-day visa waiver for the United States (a risk that stems from Cuba's placement on the list of state sponsors of terrorism).

Monetary policy also remains a pain point. In mid-December, Cuba's central bank launched a new floating exchange rate for the general public and the private sector at one dollar to 410 Cuban pesos, only slightly below the informal rate, in an attempt to bring more transactions back into the formal financial system, undermine the informal market, and recover dollar reserves. But it is unclear whether the scheme will work, as popular trust in banking institutions has cratered. Moreover, the exchange system remains tiered: certain state companies, such as those in the tourism industry, still receive a preferential rate, of 120 Cuban pesos for one dollar, while state enterprises providing crucial services to the population receive a rate of 24 Cuban pesos to the dollar. Authorities have started outright dollarizing much state-run retail, reviving a practice from the 1990s. In other words, the latest maneuvers further entrench the existing segmentation of currency markets; they do not eliminate the fundamental distortions that such an arrangement introduces into the Cuban economy.

To fix—or elide—these problems, some Cuban officials may be counting on better international relations. They are likely to be disappointed. Waiting for Washington to change course is a fool's errand: a battered Cuba, unlike oil-rich Venezuela, offers little of strategic interest to an increasingly transactional United States. But even Moscow and Beijing will be of limited help. Russian officials and business delegations have promised Cuba $1 billion in investment by 2030, and the Chinese have started building several dozen solar farms. But Havana can get only so much assistance from either country. How quickly these commitments materialize remains unclear, and both Moscow and Beijing have urged Cuba to lessen subsidies for unprofitable state companies and reduce restrictions on foreign investment and the private sector. Cuba, meanwhile, continues to run enormous trade deficits with both states and routinely asks to refinance its debts, which are thought to equal several billion dollars in the case of the Chinese. (Russia condoned most of the island's Soviet-era debt in 2014, but Cuba has reportedly accrued hundreds of millions in obligations since.) Geopolitical motives and security ties mean Moscow and Beijing are willing to provide periodic aid and help Cuba's government stay afloat, but neither is eager to completely bankroll an economic model they see as having failed.

Havana's relationships with Caracas are even more vulnerable. The Trump administration has deployed significant military assets off the coast of Venezuela, launched controversial strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels and at least one port facility, and ordered a naval blockade of sanctioned oil shipments, including those heading Cuba's way. If the Maduro regime falls—still a huge if—Cuba would lose what is left of a 25-year patronage relationship.



Cuba, then, has just one choice: liberalize its economy. This includes permitting private business to operate in more industries, opening the private sector to foreign investment, and letting these firms trade free of state intermediaries. It also means cutting fiscal deficits and actually unifying exchange rates for government-owned and private businesses at levels that reflect real economic conditions. Just as important, the state must increase legal guarantees and tax incentives for domestic and foreign companies that build productive capacity. Even with U.S. sanctions, such steps would at least give Cuba the chance to begin rebuilding its economy and attract greater foreign investment.

But it is doubtful whether Cuba has the leadership to implement or inspire consensus around such a plan. Many officials seem out of touch with reality. Over the summer, the minister of labor denied that homelessness and mendicancy had increased on the island. (After a social media fury, she was forced to resign in a rare instance of public accountability.) Policymakers also continue to send mixed signals. In late November, authorities rolled out new rules to make foreign investment more agile by allowing the payment of Cuban employees without using state intermediaries. But they simultaneously barred foreign businesses from repatriating earnings held in Cuban banks. Likewise, a new government framework to “correct distortions and recharge the economy” is full of production targets but few ideas for transforming production incentives. Cuba thus seems poised to slide further into economic decline, marked by unaccountable military enterprises, constrained private businesses, and a labor force drained of talent by migration.

Whether these challenges could eventually bring about the government's collapse is uncertain. Regime change is unlikely in the absence of a more unified opposition, and the opposition's top figures have been largely exiled or imprisoned. There are no open divisions between the security apparatus and other realms of the state. But worsening social problems—crime, inequality, drug consumption, and corruption—could accelerate interregime fissures, transnational criminal penetration, or direct foreign intervention, precisely the things loyalists of the Cuban system have long sought to avoid. Sporadic, leaderless protests are now endemic.

Today, the island seems to be sinking, just as Raúl warned it might 15 years earlier. It is doing so because he and others delayed true reform. Change will come with steep costs thanks to years of economic policy waffling and the state's refusal to give Cubans a meaningful political voice in shaping their future. But change is necessary. Each day of further delay prolongs the population's suffering.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Zohran Mamdani is sworn in as mayor of New York City","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/01/politics/nyc-mayor-oath-zohran-mamdani-inauguration","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:03:26 GMT","


Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist who campaigned on a promise to tackle the affordability crisis in one of America's most expensive cities, was sworn in as New York City's 112th mayor early Thursday.
    


            Mamdani, a 34-year-old immigrant from Uganda, makes history as the city's first Muslim mayor, first South Asian mayor and the youngest mayor to hold the high-profile office in more than a century.
    


            “This is truly the honor and the privilege of a lifetime,” Mamdani said moments after being sworn in.
    


            The former state assemblyman from Queens captured the world's attention and stunned the political establishment with his win in the Democratic primary last summer, running a campaign focused on affordability: He promised to create a universal childcare program, freeze the rent for roughly two million rent-stabilized tenants and make city buses “fast and free.”
    


            A public ceremony is set to get underway at 1 p.m. ET at City Hall Plaza. Hundreds of supporters lined the streets outside City Hall, waiting to gain access to a watch party. Security was tight, with New York police officers stationed at every crossing.
    


            Inside the plaza, the crowd began to gather early Thursday morning, bundled up in the freezing temperatures. A DJ attempted to keep the crowd warmed up as they waited for the ceremony to start.
    


            At least 4,000 people are expected to attend, including high-profile leaders of the progressive movement: Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will introduce Mamdani, and the public oath of office will be administered by independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
    


            Other familiar faces present included former Mayor Bill de Blasio, who Mamdani has described as the best mayor in recent history.
    


            A block party hosted by Mamdani's transition team — dubbed the “Inauguration of a New Era” — is being held on Broadway, just outside the gates of city hall. The new mayor's supporters lined the street behind barricades, many decked out in Zohran merchandise from his campaign and buttons that read, “NYC Inauguration 2026.”
    


            Mamdani was sworn just after midnight during a private ceremony alongside his wife, artist Rama Duwaji. His parents, filmmaker Mira Nair and Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, were also in attendance.
    


            For the ceremony, Mamdani chose a Quran from the New York Public Library that was once part of Afro-Latino historian Arturo Schomburg's personal library.
    


            In a statement prior to the ceremony, the library said Mamdani's selection of Islam's holy book “marks a significant moment in our city's history.”
    


            It's a choice steeped in meaning for Mamdani and the hundreds of thousands of Muslims who call New York City home. It's the first time a Quran has been used in a mayoral inauguration.
    


            In addition to the NYPL's book, Mamdani also used a Quran that belonged to his grandfather during the midnight ceremony, according to his transition team.
    


            New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who Mamdani has described as a “political inspiration,” administered the oath of office as Mamdani placed his left hand on the two books.

            The setting was symbolic. Mamdani was sworn in on the platform of the old City Hall subway station underneath City Hall Park in Manhattan – an architectural marvel where tiled, arched ceilings, colored glass skylights and brass chandeliers have laid dormant since the station was shuttered in 1945.
    


            The location, which is closed to the public except for the occasional guided tour, is one of New York's 28 original subway stations that opened in 1904, ushering in a new dawn of innovation and growth in New York City.
    


            In the afternoon inauguration at City Hall, he is expected to use his grandfather's Quran in addition to one used by his grandmother.
    


            Following his swearing in, Mamdani spoke about the significance of the setting, calling it “a testament to the importance of public transit to the vitality, the health and the legacy of our city.”
    


            He also announced Michael Flynn, a longtime city planner, as the city's next Department of Transportation Commissioner.
    


            Mamdani has made public transportation a central focus of his agenda. In addition to proposing to make city buses free, he has said his administration would expand the city's bicycle lane network and optimize streets for pedestrians.
    


            Mamdani's ambitious agenda has drawn some skepticism. He has proposed taxing the wealthy to pay for his proposals, something he can only do with the support of the state legislature and the governor. And while Mamdani is taking office at a time of general economic strength in the city, the high cost of living is squeezing working-class New Yorkers.
    


            The dawn of Mamdani's administration also comes as the national Democratic Party is wrestling with its identity and struggling to energize a divided base. Mamdani's win has fueled debate about whether the party should move further to the left and focus on affordability as its primary issue in the upcoming midterm elections.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump defended his energy and health in an interview with The Wall Street Journal and disclosed that he had a CT scan, not an MRI scan, during an October examination about which he and the White House delayed offering details.

Trump, in the interview, said he regretted undergoing the advanced imaging on his heart and abdomen during an October visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center because it raised public questions about his health. His physician said in a memo the White House released in December that he had “advanced imaging” as a preventative screening for men his age.

Trump had initially described it as an MRI but said he didn't know what part of his body he had scanned. A CT scan is a quicker form of diagnostic imaging than an MRI but offers less detail about differences in tissue.

The president's doctor, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, said in a statement released Thursday by the White House that Trump underwent the exam in October because he planned to be at Walter Reed to meet people working there. Trump had already undergone an annual physical in April.

“President Trump agreed to meet with the staff and soldiers at Walter Reed Medical Hospital in October. In order to make the most of the President's time at the hospital, we recommended he undergo another routine physical evaluation to ensure continued optimal health,” Barbabella said. 




Barbabella said that he asked the president to undergo either a CT scan or MRI “to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues” and the results were “perfectly normal and revealed absolutely no abnormalities.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Thursday that the president's doctors and the White House have “always maintained the President received advanced imaging” but said that “additional details on the imaging have been disclosed by the President himself” because he “has nothing to hide.”

“In retrospect, it's too bad I took it because it gave them a little ammunition,” Trump said in the interview with The Wall Street Journal published Thursday. “I would have been a lot better off if they didn't, because the fact that I took it said, ‘Oh gee, is something wrong?' Well, nothing's wrong.”

The 79-year-old became the oldest person to take the oath of office when he was sworn in as president last year and has been sensitive to questions about his health, particularly as he has repeatedly questioned his predecessor Joe Biden's fitness for office. 

Biden, who turned 82 in the last year of his presidency, was dogged the end of the his tenure and during his abandoned attempt to seek reelection over scrutiny of his age and mental acuity.

But questions have also swirled around Trump's health this year as he's been seen with bruising on the back of his right hand that has been conspicuous despite a slathering of makeup on top, along with noticeable swelling at his ankles. 

The White House this summer said the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition among older adults. The condition happens when veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart and it pools in the lower legs. 

In the interview, Trump said he briefly tried wearing compression socks to address the swelling but stopped because he didn't like them.

The bruising on Trump's hand, according to Leavitt, is from “frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin,” which Trump takes regularly to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.

He said he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend but said he has resisted taking less because he's been taking it for 25 years and said he is “a little superstitious.” Trump takes 325 milligrams of aspirin daily, according to Barbabella.

“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?”

Trump, in the interview, denied he has fallen asleep during White House meetings when cameras have caught him with his eyes closed, instead insisting he was resting his eyes or blinking.

“I'll just close. It's very relaxing to me,” he said. “Sometimes they'll take a picture of me blinking, blinking, and they'll catch me with the blink.”

He said that he's never slept much at night, a habit he also described during his first term, and said he starts his day early in the White House residence before moving to the Oval Office around 10 a.m. and working until 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. 

The president dismissed questions about his hearing, saying he only struggled to hear “when there's a lot of people talking,” and said he has plenty of energy, which he credited to his genes. 

“Genetics are very important,” he said. “And I have very good genetics.”

CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) — Swiss investigators are probing what caused a fire in a bar at an Alpine ski resort that left around 40 people dead and another 115 injured during a New Year's celebration.

Most injuries, many of them serious, occurred when the blaze swept through the crowded bar less than two hours after midnight Thursday in southwestern Switzerland.

The Crans-Montana resort is best known as an international ski and golf venue. Overnight, its crowded Le Constellation bar morphed from a scene of revelry into the site of potentially one of Switzerland's worst tragedies.

Crans-Montana is less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Sierre, Switzerland, where 28 people, including many children, were killed when a bus from Belgium crashed inside a Swiss tunnel in 2012.

Here's what we know about the deadly fire:

The blaze broke out around 1:30 a.m. Thursday inside the Le Constellation bar amid the holiday celebration.

Two women told French broadcaster BFMTV they were inside when they saw a male bartender lifting a female bartender on his shoulders as she held a lit candle in a bottle. The flames spread, collapsing the wooden ceiling, they told the broadcaster.

People frantically tried to escape from the basement nightclub up a narrow flight of stairs and through a narrow door, causing a crowd surge, one of the women said.

A young man at the scene said people smashed windows to escape the fire, some gravely injured, reported BFMTV. He said he saw about 20 people scrambling to get out of the smoke and flames, likening what happened to a horror movie.

The injured were so numerous that the intensive care unit and operating theater at the regional hospital quickly hit full capacity, said Mathias Reynard, head of the regional government of the Valais Canton.

While officials said Thursday it was too early to determine the fire's cause, investigators have already ruled out that it could have been an attack. 

Experts have not yet been able to go inside the wreckage, said Beatrice Pilloud, Valais Canton attorney general, at a news conference.

Work is underway to identify the victims and inform their families, according to Valais Canton police commander Frédéric Gisler.

The Swiss officials called the blaze an “embrasement généralisé,” a French firefighting term describing how a blaze can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft.

Victims suffered from serious burns and smoke inhalation. Some were flown to specialist hospitals across the country.

Authorities urged people to show caution in the coming days to avoid any accidents that could require the already overwhelmed medical resources.

With high-altitude ski runs rising around 3,000 meters (nearly 9,850 feet) in the heart of the Valais region's snowy peaks and pine forests, Crans-Montana is one of the top venues on the World Cup circuit. 

The resort will host the best men's and women's downhill racers, including Lindsey Vonn, for their final events before the Milan Cortina Olympics in February.

The town's Crans-sur-Sierre golf club, down the street from the bar, stages the European Masters each August on a picturesque course.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A Ukrainian drone strike killed 24 people and wounded at least 50 more as they celebrated the New Year in a Russian-occupied village in Ukraine's Kherson region, Russian officials said Thursday, as tensions between the two nations continue to spike despite diplomats hailing productive peace talks.

Three drones struck a cafe and hotel in the resort town of Khorly on the Black Sea coast, the region's Moscow-installed leader Vladimir Saldo said in a statement on Telegram. He said that one of the drones carried an incendiary mixture, sparking a blaze. 

Ukrainian officials did not immediately comment on the claim of a strike. The attack could not be independently verified by The Associated Press.

The attack was condemned by a number of Russian officials. Valentina Matviyenko, the chair of Russia's upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, said that the strike “strengthened” Russia's resolve to quickly achieve its goals in its almost four-year invasion of Ukraine.

The strike “once again demonstrates the validity of our initial demands,” Matviyenko said.

The statement follows claims from Moscow that Ukraine launched a long-range drone attack against one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's official residences in northwestern Russia on Tuesday. Kyiv has denounced the claims as a “lie.”

Russia's Ministry of Defense said Thursday that its specialists had accessed the navigation system in one of the drones it claimed was used in the attack and used its data to confirm that Putin's residence was the drone's final destination. The claim could not be verified as the ministry did not share evidence on the findings, but officials said that it would transfer the data to U.S. officials “through established channels.”




On Wednesday, Russia's Defense Ministry also released a video on Wednesday of a downed drone it said was involved in the attack.

The nighttime clip showed a man in camouflage, a helmet and a Kevlar vest standing near a damaged drone lying in snow. The man, his face covered, talks about the drone. Neither the man nor the Defense Ministry provided any location or date and neither the video nor its claims could be independently verified.

Kyiv has called the allegations of an attack on Putin's residence a ruse to derail ongoing peace negotiations, which have ramped up in recent weeks on both sides of the Atlantic.

In his New Year's address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a peace deal was “90% ready” but warned that the remaining 10%, believed to include key sticking points such as territory, would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live.” 

Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that he, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner had a “productive call” with the national security advisers of Britain, France, Germany and Ukraine “to discuss advancing the next steps in the European peace process.”

“We focused on how to move the discussions forward in a practical way on behalf of (Trump's) peace process, including strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart,” Witkoff said in a post on X.

Lead Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov also reaffirmed that European and Ukrainian officials plan to meet Saturday, while Zelenskyy is due to hold talks next week with European leaders. 

In the diplomatic sphere, Kyiv has also continued to push the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to take action against Russia for alleged attacks on electricity infrastructure deemed “critical for nuclear safety and security” at Ukraine's nuclear power stations. 

The IAEA on Tuesday published a Note Verbale sent by Kyiv to the agency, saying that a Russian drone and missile attack on Dec. 23 had caused certain Ukrainian nuclear power plants to lose a “significant part of their off-site power connections.” 

Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russia attacked the Odesa region overnight, targeting civilian infrastructure in several waves of drone attacks, according to regional head Oleh Kiper.

In a post on Telegram, Kiper said a two-story residential building was damaged and that a drone hit an apartment on the 17th floor of a high-rise building without detonating. There were no casualties reported.

In its daily report, Ukraine's air force said air defense forces had downed or suppressed 176 of 205 drones targeting the country overnight. It said hits by 24 strike drones were recorded at 15 locations and the attack was still ongoing. ___

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said he's dropping — for now — his push to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, a move that comes after legal roadblocks held up the effort.

“We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!” he said in a social media post Wednesday. 

Governors typically control states' National Guardsmen, and Trump had deployed troops to all three cities against the wishes of state and local Democratic leaders. He said it was necessary as part of a broader crackdown on immigration, crime and protests. 

The president has made a crackdown on crime in cities a centerpiece of his second term — and has toyed with the idea of invoking the Insurrection Act to stop his opponents from using the courts to block his plans. He has said he sees his tough-on-crime approach as a winning political issue ahead of next year's midterm elections.

Troops had already left Los Angeles after the president deployed them earlier this year as part of a broader crackdown on crime and immigration.

In his post, Trump said the troops' presence was responsible for a drop in crime in the three cities, though they were never on the streets in Chicago and Portland as legal challenges played out. When the Chicago deployment was challenged in court, a Justice Department lawyer said the Guard's mission would be to protect federal properties and government agents in the field, not “solving all of crime in Chicago.”




Portland Mayor Keith Wilson's office in a statement said the city's reduction in crime was due to the efforts of local police and public safety programs. Chicago officials echoed the sentiment, saying in a release Tuesday that the city had 416 homicides in 2025 — the fewest since 2014.

Trump's push to deploy the troops in Democrat-led cities has been met with legal challenges at nearly every turn.

The Supreme Court in December refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area. The order was not a final ruling but was a significant and rare setback by the high court for the president's efforts.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker wrote on X Wednesday that Trump “lost in court when Illinois stood up against his attempt to militarize American cities with the National Guard. Now Trump is forced to stand down.”

Hundreds of troops from California and Oregon were deployed to Portland, but a federal judge barred them from going on the streets. A judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there in November after a three-day trial.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement Wednesday that her office had not yet received “official notification that the remaining federalized Oregon National Guard troops can return home. They were never lawfully deployed to Portland and there was no need for their presence. If President Trump has finally chosen to follow court orders and demobilize our troops, that's a big win for Oregonians and for the rule of law.”

Trump's decision to federalize National Guard troops began in Los Angeles in June, when protesters took to the streets in response to a blitz of immigration arrests in the area. He deployed about 4,000 troops and 700 Marines to guard federal buildings and, later, to protest federal agents as they carried out immigration arrests. 

The number of troops slowly dwindled until just several hundred were left. They were removed from the streets by Dec. 15 after a lower court ruling that also ordered control to be returned to Gov. Gavin Newsom. But an appeals court had paused the second part of the order, meaning control remained with Trump. In a Tuesday court filing, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to return control of the National Guard to Newsom.

“About time (Trump) admitted defeat,” Newsom said in a social media post. “We've said it from day one: the federal takeover of California's National Guard is illegal.”

Troops will remain on the ground in several other cities. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in December paused a lower court ruling that had called for an end to the deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., where they've been deployed since August after Trump declared a “crime emergency.”

Trump also ordered the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis in September as part of a larger federal task force to combat crime, a move supported by the state's Republican Gov. Bill Lee and senators. A Tennessee judge blocked the use of the Guard, siding with Democratic state and local officials who sued. However, the judge stayed the decision to block the Guard as the state appeals, allowing the deployment to continue.

In New Orleans, about 350 National Guard troops deployed by Trump arrived in the city's historic French Quarter on Tuesday and are set to stay through Mardi Gras to help with safety. The state's Republican governor and the city's Democratic mayor support the deployment.

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Keionte Scott peeked over at the Miami sideline to see the reaction of his teammates as he sprinted 72 yards untouched for a touchdown returning an interception against defending national champion Ohio State.

They certainly were excited, as were a Pro Football Hall of Fame receiver and a former coach who won national championships with the Hurricanes. 

Scott picked off a screen pass by Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin, Carson Beck threw a touchdown pass and 10th-ranked Miami shocked the Buckeyes 24-14 on Wednesday night at the Cotton Bowl in the first College Football Playoff quarterfinal.

“I was full of emotions. ... That was a pretty cool moment,” said Scott, who has TD returns on both of his interceptions this season. “Just having fun. ... That's what this team relies on, man, just going out there playing free and just having fun.”

The Hurricanes (12-2, CFP No. 10 seed) have won two playoff games to get into football's final four after needing an at-large berth to make the 12-team field, after not even playing in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game. One more win and they will get to play for a national championship in their home stadium.

Next for Miami in coach Mario Cristobal's fourth season is a CFP semifinal at the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 8 against No. 3 seed Georgia or No. 6 seed Ole Miss, the SEC teams in the Sugar Bowl on Thursday night.




There hasn't been a national title for “The U” since 2001, which was their fifth; Cristobal was a standout offensive tackle for the Hurricanes in their 1989 and 1991 championship seasons. The Hurricanes were denied a repeat championship in 2002 with a double-overtime loss in the Fiesta Bowl to Ohio State, the only other time the teams met in a bowl — and the last Miami played in that game. 

“It is 100% not about me. I'm part of their team, I'm a part of that family,” Cristobal said. “It is my obligation as a former Miami Hurricane player and all the things that Miami did for my brother and I to do my best to try to provide these guys with even better opportunities so they can fulfill all the great things they are destined for.”

Before receiver Michael Irvin and coach Jimmy Johnson were Super Bowl champions with the Dallas Cowboys, they were part of the Hurricanes' 1987 national championship. Irvin excitedly ran down the sideline while Scott was scoring for a 14-0 lead, and Johnson was nearby when acknowledged by Cristobal during the on-field trophy presentation. 

Now it's third-ranked Ohio State (12-2, CFP No. 2 seed), which went into the game as a 9 1/2-point favorite according to BetMGM Sportsbook, that can't win back-to-back national titles for the first time in program history. 

The Buckeyes hadn't played since a 13-10 loss to now-No. 1 Indiana in a Big Ten championship game matchup of undefeated teams on Dec. 6. They still got a first-round bye, then lost just like all four teams that went directly to the quarterfinal round in the inaugural 12-team playoff last season.

“We worked really hard during the last three weeks leading up to this game to come out of the gates and win the first quarter, win the first half, be ready to go,” Buckeyes coach Ryan Day said. “I think the guys bought into it. But at the end of the day, we didn't get it done.”

Scott's interception return came only 1:42 after Beck's quick pass to Mark Fletcher Jr. out of the backfield for a 9-yard score.

Beck, who was part of Georgia's national titles in 2021 and 2022 when Stetson Bennett was the starter, completed 19 of 26 passes for 138 yards. 

When asked what stood out to him about these Hurricanes, Beck said, “Just the way that this team has responded to adversity. We knew coming into today that it wasn't going to be easy.”

The TD throw to Fletcher, who also ran 19 times for 90 yards and was the game's offensive MVP, was the seventh of 13 consecutive completions for Beck. That set a record in the Cotton Bowl, which was played for the 90th time. 

Sayin, a freshman backup behind Will Howard for Ohio State's championship run last season, was 22 of 35 for 287 yards with two interceptions and a TD to Jeremiah Smith. Sayin was sacked five times. 

AP All-America receiver Smith, the Miami native, caught seven of those passes for 157 yards, including a 14-yard TD on a fourth down in the fourth quarter. 

Carter Davis added a 49-yard field goal in the third quarter and ChaMar Brown ran for a 5-yard TD in the game's final minute for the Hurricanes, whose 24 points were the most Ohio State gave up this season.

Miami: The Hurricanes have won six games in a row since an overtime loss Nov. 1 at SMU, less than 25 miles from AT&T Stadium, where the Cotton Bowl is played. They also made their CFP debut in the Lone Star State, winning 10-3 at No. 7 Texas A&M in the first round on Dec. 20.

Ohio State: All-America safety Caleb Downs, who started in the CFP for the third season in a row, became the first player to force two fumbles in a CFP game. ... The Buckeyes had gone four consecutive quarters — the equivalent of a full game — until Bo Jackson's 1-yard TD run to cap its opening drive of the second half. 

Miami waits to see who it will play in the Fiesta Bowl. Ohio State is scheduled to open the the 2026 season at home against Ball State on Sept. 5.

Zohran Mamdani was sworn in as New York City's mayor just after midnight at a historic subway station, becoming the city's first Muslim mayor ahead of a public inauguration at City Hall. (@NYCMayorsOffice)

New York City Socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was officially sworn in as mayor in a midnight ceremony by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

""This is truly the honor and the privilege of a lifetime,"" Mamdani said in a brief speech.

The early Thursday morning event was a private ceremony where Mamdani was accompanied by family members at the Old City Hall Station, a decommissioned subway station with deep historical roots.

In his first speech as mayor, Mamdani called the historic subway station a ""testament to the importance of public transit to the vitality, the health and the legacy of our city.""

He also announced the appointment of Mike Flynn as his new Department of Transportation commissioner.

In a press release, the Mamdani transition team said the midnight swearing was chosen to be at a location symbolizing how the subway system is the ""lifeblood of New York"" and a ""reminder of the city Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is fighting for: a city built by and for New Yorkers.""

""When Old City Hall Station first opened in 1904 — one of New York's 28 original subway stations — it was a physical monument to a city that dared to be both beautiful and build great things that would transform working peoples' lives. That ambition need not be a memory confined only to our past, nor must it be isolated only to the tunnels beneath City Hall: it will be the purpose of the administration fortunate enough to serve New Yorkers from the building above,"" Mamdani said in the press release.

Before the ceremony, he stated that upon taking his oath, ""from the station at the dawn of the New Year, I will do so, humbled by the opportunity to lead millions of New Yorkers into a new era of opportunity, and honored to carry forward our city's legacy of greatness.""

Mamdani used a Quran during his swearing-in ceremony, according to his campaign, making him the first Muslim mayor of NYC and the first to be sworn in using a Quran.

On Thursday afternoon, Mamdani will be sworn in publicly by Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders after opening remarks are delivered at his 1 p.m. inauguration by another progressive ally, Dem. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Typically, inauguration tickets are given out to roughly 4,000 people, but the Mamdani transition team says all New Yorkers will be invited to the inauguration and a block party immediately following.

The 1 p.m. inauguration will take place on the steps of City Hall.

Mamdani soundly defeated former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa in early November, capping off a rapid political ascent that started with single-digit support when he announced his mayoral campaign in October 2024.

The new mayor closed the ceremony with a smile, telling those gathered, ""Thank you all so much, now I will see you later,"" before heading up a flight of stairs.

Joel Klatt joins Colin Cowherd to ask if Miami can upset Ohio State, discuss Dante Moore and Oregon potentially struggling vs. Texas Tech, and if Fernando Mendoza can have a big game vs. Alabama. 

There was much debate a few weeks ago over whether the Miami Hurricanes belonged in the College Football Playoff, and on Wednesday night, they proved the naysayers wrong.

The Hurricanes delivered a 24-14 upset victory over the defending national champion Ohio State Buckeyes in the Cotton Bowl Classic to advance to the College Football Playoff semifinals. Miami is the first double-digit seed to make it this far.

Miami refused to be stopped on one of their final drives. Mark Fletcher Jr. and CharMar Brown dug deep to find the energy and the will to keep the ball moving. Carson Beck found wide receiver C.J. Daniels to get another first down with under two minutes to play.

Brown scored with 55 seconds left to deliver the final blow. Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin threw an interception on their final drive.

It was a hard-fought game with both teams delivering big hits after big hits. The Hurricanes finally broke through in the second quarter when Beck faked a run and found Fletcher for a short pass. Fletcher ran the ball for a touchdown to go up 7-0 early.

On the next drive, Keionte Scott picked off Sayin and returned the interception for a touchdown. Ohio State missed a field goal before halftime and Miami went to the locker room with a 14-0 lead.

ARCH MANNING'S 60-YARD TOUCHDOWN RUN DELIVERS CRITICAL BLOW IN TEXAS' WIN OVER MICHIGAN

Sayin started the third quarter with an 11-play, 82-yard drive that took nearly seven minutes off the clock. It ended with a Bo Jackson touchdown. Ohio State followed up with a touchdown on a Jeremiah Smith catch on the next drive to cut the deficit to three points following a Miami field goal.

Ohio State punted on its next drive and then turned the ball over on its final drive.

Beck changed the game with his legs as much as he did as a passer. Ohio State was forced to respect his ability to take off with the football. He had 23 yards but made a few clutch plays with his feet.

He was 19-of-26 through the air with 138 passing yards and a touchdown pass.

Fletcher, despite turning the ball over in the first quarter, ran the ball for 90 yards on 19 carries. Brown started to get carries late in the game and scored the crucial touchdown in the end.

Ohio State allowed more than 20 points in a game for the first time since their national championship win against Notre Dame back on Jan. 20.

The defense was able to do enough to knock Sayin off his game. Sayin had two interceptions in the game and was sacked five times.

China's efforts to reunify with Taiwan are “unstoppable,” Chinese leader Xi Jinping said in a New Year's address on Wednesday.

The Chinese military recently conducted major military exercises near Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory; China hasn't ruled out military intervention to complete the reunification.

Xi addressed the Chinese people in a nine-minute address on Wednesday night.

“We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share a bond of blood and kinship,” he said. “The reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable. Only a strong Communist Party of China can make our country strong.”

The United States Embassy in China and China's foreign affairs spokesperson reposted the quote.

Taiwan condemned China's military exercises this week, which featured missile tests and the mobilization of navy vessels, aircraft, and other military armaments. The drills were named “Justice Mission 2025.”

“The Chinese Communist Party's aggressive and militaristic provocations endanger regional security and stability, and have been condemned by democratic allies in the international community,” Taiwan's defense department said in a statement.

There are questions about whether China will launch military operations targeting Taiwan in 2026. Taiwan's president, Lai Ching-te, acknowledged that 2026 will be critical for Taiwan in his New Year's address.

“The coming year, 2026, will be a crucial one for Taiwan,” he said, adding Taiwan must “make plans for the worst, but hope for the best.”

“We are willing to engage in exchanges and cooperation with China on an equal and dignified basis, promoting a peaceful and shared environment across the strait,” Lai said. “As long as China acknowledges the existence of the Republic of China, respects the Taiwanese people's desire for a democratic and free way of life.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), whose administration is accused of allowing Somali fraudsters to target Minnesota's child care subsidies program, received nearly $10,000 in campaign contributions from supporters connected to Somali-operated day care centers.

The Democratic donors involved in Somali day cares and home health services have written considerable checks to Walz's gubernatorial campaign, according to campaign finance filings compiled by the Washington Examiner.

Like the Somali-run child care facilities highlighted by videographer Nick Shirley, these companies appear as legitimate businesses on paper, but upon closer inspection, some appear not to be operational.

Walz's 2022 reelection campaign received $1,000 from Mohamed Rabi, of Hiawatha Adult Day Center Inc, which does not have its own website, for instance.

Third-party sites operating out of New Jersey list the facility's address as Franklin Avenue, a crime hot spot in south Minneapolis. The adult day care center is supposedly housed within a run-down strip mall, occupying four commercial suites next to African Immigrants Community Services, a refugee resettlement program helping East Africans obtain public benefits.

Doing business as Hiawatha Senior Center, the entity is actively registered with the Minnesota Department of Education as a child nutrition organization, receiving reimbursements for meals and snacks served at the center through the state's federally funded Child and Adult Care Food Program.

The state Department of Human Services previously cited the center for failing to provide patient records, including medical history, monthly progress reports, medication regimen, and notes on treatment.

Yusuf Hassan, a business consultant, is listed as the center's chief executive officer. Hassan was also the director of Loving Arms Adult Daycare, another agency that lacked a discernible digital footprint and received payments through the state nutrition program.

In 2021, Walz received a $1,000 campaign contribution from Khadar Jama, of Open Hearts Home Health Care, a Minneapolis-based at-home care provider that also lacks an independent website.

The care center's office address is the same as Caring Home Health's listed location, which traces back to a three-bedroom residential home. Caring Home Health, a Somali-owned assisted living facility licensed by the Minnesota Department of Health, was flagged in 2024 for a number of safety violations, including insufficient patient care plans, according to a DHS inspection report.

WALZ ALLIES LED STATE AGENCIES THAT OVERSAW MASSIVE ALLEGED SOMALI DAY CARE FRAUD

When Walz first ran for governor in 2018, he received $2,250 from Abdiwadi Husen, of Minnesota Quality Care, and $500 from Nazneen Khatoon, of Best Care Home Health Care.

Best Care was under investigation in 2023 for suspected maltreatment. According to a memorandum, the DHS inspector general's office discovered “neglect of a vulnerable adult” in the facility's care. The incident involved a staff member smoking marijuana during a patient's medical appointment and then driving the client, who has early-onset Alzheimer's disease, home while under the influence.

That year, Best Care was also issued a correction order for repeatedly failing to develop individual abuse prevention plans as required and for failing to complete well-being assessments. 

One past Yelp review claimed that Best Care “seem[ed] more concerned about making money than doing a good job,” citing billing as the facility's top priority.

In 2023, a judge found that Best Care improperly collected $2.23 million in Minnesota Health Care Program funds and ordered the organization to pay a penalty for the overpayments, which resulted from documentation errors.

Best Care was previously accused in civil court of fraudulently billing or overcharging the federal government for healthcare services that were never actually performed. The staff allegedly forged fraudulent nursing notes, which Best Care reportedly submitted as proof of care to collect Medicare and Medicaid payments. In 2014, Best Care reached a settlement agreement with the federal government, which resulted from a case brought by whistleblower claims.

In a separate 2002 suit, the U.S. government lodged civil proceedings against Best Care for allegedly submitting fraudulent Medicare reimbursement claims. According to the complaint, Best Care, “by and through Khatoon,” billed Medicare on behalf of two other healthcare organizations that were not eligible for reimbursements themselves because they were not certified as Medicare providers, and agreed to split the payments.

Between 2017 and 2018, Kenyan-born businessman Siyad Abdullahi, of Somali descent, donated a total of $4,000 to Walz's campaign coffers.

Abdullahi, a self-described “nationally recognized expert in cultural competency,” is the co-founder of several Minneapolis-area companies, including Midwest Career Institute, The Language Banc, and Pro-Health Home Care Agency, a home and community-based service eligible for Medicaid reimbursements.

Pro-Health Home Care, sometimes stylized as Pro-Health Care Inc., supplies “culturally appropriate” caregivers outside of a hospital setting for post-discharge senior citizens and other incapacitated individuals. Aside from non-medical personal care assistants, an intake coordinator said that there are currently no skilled nurses available, as advertised, and recommended seeking private-duty nursing services elsewhere in Minnesota. Abdullahi had told the press that they have over 700 professionally trained caretakers, including licensed nurses, on hand.

MINNESOTA HUMAN SERVICES EMPLOYEES BLAME WALZ FOR ‘MASSIVE FRAUD' IN STATE

The Language Banc, which has since been acquired by Piedmont Global Language Solutions, purportedly had more than 1,000 contracted translators available around the clock to provide 24/7 interpretation services for communicating medical matters.

However, one client review on the company's Yelp page warned, “Scammer, using unqualified or uneducated interpreters for medical interpreting. Beware!”

A data entry employee, who later became a business developer for Language Banc, sued Abdullahi in federal court, claiming that she was not paid overtime, despite working almost 60 hours a week, and was not allowed to take lunch breaks. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed in 2015 for unspecified reasons.

Neighboring a used car lot, the Language Banc was located inside a small building, now home to the newly shuttered Kids Care Center, a separate Somali-owned business that was fined for failing to perform proper background checks on its staff.

Abdullahi's Language Banc took over the commercial space from Midwest Career Institute after the vocational school, which trained bilingual healthcare workers, dissolved following its brief operation.

The companies combined produced a revenue of $6 million, Abdullahi told Twin Cities Business in 2013.

“CHAMS Media, Your Visibility Partner,” a Kenyan-based content production and promotional brand-marketing company, recently released a documentary-length profile praising Abdullahi as a “celebrated…leader in Minnesota” running multiple healthcare-related businesses.

In the video, Abdullahi explained to Kenyan viewers where Minneapolis is and “how to make it in business abroad as a foreigner.” The footage also featured photos of Abdullahi, a Hillary Clinton donor, posing for one-on-one pictures with the former Secretary of State and former President Bill Clinton.

WALZ SAYS HE WOULD ‘WELCOME MORE' SOMALIS AS FRAUD INVESTIGATION INTENSIFIES

Local news outlets in Minneapolis have published similar stories touting Abdullahi's entrepreneurial success. Business Journal's Minneapolis-St. Paul Division declared Abdullahi one of the Most Admired CEOs of 2020, and Language Banc the 20th fastest-growing company in the Twin Cities region at that time.

In Minneapolis, Abdullahi has held several positions on city committees tasked with advising the mayor and city council on policy and budgetary matters. Among them, Abdullahi served as a business representative on the Minneapolis Workforce Council, a member of the Minneapolis Public Health Advisory Committee, and by mayoral appointment on the city's Capital Long-Range Improvement Committee.

Abdullahi unsuccessfully ran for governor of Wajir County in Kenya's 2022 gubernatorial races.

(The Center Square) – One of the nearly 300 new laws that took effect in Illinois on New Year's Day is a ban on compact fluorescent light bulbs.

State Rep. Nicholas Smith (D-Chicago) introduced House Bill 2363 in February 2023. Gov. JB Pritzker signed the measure in August 2024.

The law prohibits the sale and distribution of screw-base and bayonet-base compact fluorescent lamps. Restrictions on pin-base compact fluorescent and linear fluorescent lamps are set to begin in 2027.

HB 2363's Senate sponsor, state Sen. Adriane Johnson (D-Buffalo Grove) said toxic pollutants in fluorescent bulbs pose a health risk.

According to a report by the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), three in four fluorescent lamps are improperly disposed of, thus releasing mercury into the environment.

State Rep. Nicole La Ha (R-Homer Glen) voted in favor of HB 2363 but said lawmakers should focus on smart, affordable solutions.

“Any time that we have unfunded mandates or things that are going to affect our small businesses, or there's more red tape that we have to push people through, I'm not always going to be very excited about those things,” La Ha told The Center Square.

When “An Inconvenient Truth” documentary was released in 2006, former Vice President Al Gore encouraged Americans to replace incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescents. Many environmental groups also promoted CFLs.

Tosi Ufodike was an Illinois House candidate in 2024, when she lost to incumbent state Rep. Nabeela Syed (D-Palatine) in the general election. Ufodike is also campaigning for the Republican nomination in 2026.

Ufodike noted that Vermont became the first U.S. state to approve a ban on fluorescent bulbs when state lawmakers approved legislation there in 2022.

“There's a growing trend to have energy-efficient LED lighting. Of course, we always want to have energy-efficient lighting and resources, but I always look at, ‘What's the cost?'” Ufodike told The Center Square.

TRUMP WITHDRAWS NATIONAL GUARD FROM CHICAGO, LA, AND PORTLAND DESPITE ‘GREATLY REDUCED' CRIME

Ufodike said suburban voters are stretched thin.

“They're worried about gas. They're worried about putting food on the table. As long as it's done with the taxpayer in mind, then I'm ok with it,” Ufodike said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Iranians Have Had Enough","https://www.theatlantic.com/international/2026/01/iran-protests/685472/","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 14:47:30 GMT","

The demonstrations erupting across the Islamic Republic reflect deep economic and political discontent.

A wave of protests started by shopkeepers swept through Tehran in December. Iranians have had such a terrible year—facing such a decline in living standards and such a sense of political impasse—that no one was terribly surprised when demonstrations filled the streets.

I asked one Iranian student why she had taken part in the street protests. “Yeah, why should we protest?” she replied sarcastically. “After all, we have it so good!”

The immediate spark for the protests was a sharp decline in the value of the Iranian currency. At one point last week, a U.S. dollar traded for almost 1.5 million rials, having lost more than half its value in a year. As recently as 2021, a dollar cost around 250,000 rials and, only a decade ago, around 30,000. This continuous decline has slashed savings, destroyed the Iranian middle class, and inflicted real suffering on the working classes. The protests began on Sunday with merchants who rely on importing electrical goods and find that very few can now afford them. But they've quickly mushroomed—as did previous rounds did in 2017, 2019, and 2022—spreading to cities in provinces such as Hamedan, Isfahan, and Lorestan, and drawing in students, pensioners, and members of Gen Z.

Like previous waves of demonstrations, the protests have quickly acquired a political character. Protesters have chanted, “Death to the dictator,” targeting the octogenarian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has held the top post since 1989 with little accountability. As a statement read out by students at Tehran's Beheshti University put it: “This criminal system has taken our future hostage for 47 years. It won't be changed with reform or with false promises.”

Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian, elected with promises of good governance last year, has overseen electricity and water cuts while failing to realize signature promises such as lifting restrictions of the internet. Wanting to show he is cut from a different cloth than his hard-line predecessor, Pezeshkian quickly promised to meet with representatives of protesters. His spokesperson affirmed “the constitutional right of peaceful protest” for Iranians.

But Pezeshkian doesn't control the security forces, so these pronouncements ring hollow. Dozens of protesters have already been arrested, including Sarira Karimi, head of a student union chapter at the University of Tehran. (Karimi was released on Wednesday.) In the small cities of Kuhdasht and Fasa, security forces shot at protesters. According to local officials, a member of the security forces was killed in Kuhdasht. Protesters also clashed with police in Hamedan and Najafabad.

On Tuesday, Pezeshkian met with representatives of some guilds and merchant unions and promised to improve the economy. After almost 18 months in office, he finally dismissed Mohammadreza Farzin, the unpopular central-bank governor appointed by his hard-line predecessor. Farzin's successor, Abdolnasser Hemmati, a pro-reform economist and Pezeshkian's former finance minister, has promised economic stability.

But Hemmati faces a tall order. He is likely to slash interest rates (the official rate currently stands at 40 percent) and to pursue banking and currency-exchange reform. But these are hardly panaceas for Iran's deeply beleaguered economy, which suffers from international isolation, Western-imposed sanctions, and domestic mismanagement by a regime that has long failed to prioritize its people's welfare.

Iran's current monthly minimum wage, of around 104 million rials, barely buys a gram of 18-karat gold (often used as a measure of real value). Nurses and teachers earn around 150 to 250 million rials a month while a semi-decent apartment in Tehran rents for around 200 million. Many professionals supplement their income by moonlighting as ride-share drivers or taking other odd jobs. Thousands have emigrated to seek a better life elsewhere.

To make things worse, Iranians live in the fear of another round of military strikes by Israel or the United States. “You can't plan even for two weeks in this country,” a young man who took part in the protests told me. “Without stability, there is no prospect for growth or welfare. We live day by day.”

To change that, the regime would need to come to an agreement with the Trump administration that lifts the sanctions or at least keeps Iran safe from war. But Khamenei's harsh ideological stance against Israel and the U.S. makes that hard to achieve. On Tuesday, protesters in Tehran used a classic protest chant: “Neither Gaza, nor Lebanon, I give my life for Iran.” The slogan, popular since 2009, reflects opposition to Iran's backing for militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah. The protesters believe that military adventurism has drained Iranian resources and helped put the country at odds with both the West and its Arab neighbors. In other words, Iranians link their economic malaise to their regime's foreign policy.

Can the protesters prevail against the Islamic Republic?

Every time Iranians come out to the streets, many around the world express this wish. Prominent American and Israeli politicians have already done so in the past few days. But rattled as the regime might be, it has seen mass protests off repeatedly in recent years.

Opponents of the Islamic Republic remain hopelessly disorganized and disunited. Some protesters have chanted slogans in favor of Reza Pahlavi, Iran's exiled crown prince. But Pahlavi remains a divisive figure among anti-regime Iranians. Many reject his claim to leadership. Pahlavi's supporters and top advisers routinely criticize popular domestic dissidents including the Nobel Peace laureate Narges Mohammadi, actress Taraneh Alidoosti, and rapper Toumaj Salehi. Earlier this month, Mohammadi was physically attacked by pro-Pahlavi protesters in the northeastern city of Mashhad.

Regardless of their politics, all opposition factions have failed to build powerful organizations or lasting networks that could direct the protests. Without such direction, the current protests are likely to lose momentum and fizzle out, just like previous rounds. Even if they were to last, it is far likelier that figures from inside the regime's ranks would take the initiative and wrest power from Khamenei, than that the protesters would succeed in bringing about a change to the regime's basic structures.

“I am happy from the bottom of my heart to see others in the streets,” a young woman who took part in protests on Wednesday told me. “But I also know that we are economically fucked and things won't get better anytime soon. We also have no easy way of winning against these bastards. It is hard to be hopeful.”

Even as Iranians show incredible bravery by coming out against their thuggish regime, a winning strategy continues to be elusive.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","A Bizarre, Challenging Book More People Should Read","https://www.theatlantic.com/books/2026/01/challenging-book-literature-dewitt-gridneff-your-name-here/685453/","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:00:00 GMT","

The true pleasure of literature can be found in demanding works such as Your Name Here, by Helen DeWitt and Ilya Gridneff.

Every year, I set myself a reading challenge. These are sometimes small—read more poetry; read older books—and sometimes quite large. More than a decade ago, I spent an entire year reading nothing but writing in translation, an experience that fundamentally reoriented my literary habits. Part of my annual resolution is to devote each summer to filling in a major blind spot. I finished Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, for example, over three years, cracking open one gray Vintage volume every June.

And one year, my goal was to get my hands on The Last Samurai, by Helen DeWitt. I had been hearing about the novel for years from writers and critics but could not find a copy. First published in 2000, DeWitt's debut sold well but fell quickly out of print, stranding it in that curious creative purgatory reserved for the deeply loved but commercially overlooked. It became more legend than literature: People whispered about a mind-expanding book crammed with Greek letters, a coming-of-age tale that would teach its audience about philosophy and film history, then convince any reader that they could speak Japanese.

It intrigued and intimidated me, even as I dug in. I would read a few pages, flip ahead to the foreign alphabets, and close the book again. But when I actually knuckled down to finish the thing, I found myself cackling, and underlining, and speeding through the story of the child-genius Ludo and his mother, Sibylla, who is determined to raise her son on a course of advanced mathematics and Old Norse and repeat viewings of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai. Why, I wondered, had I waited so long? Why had I let myself be cowed?

Such is the legend of DeWitt, whose formidability precedes her. Now 68, she has spent most of her career creating the kind of fiction many might call “difficult,” and fighting with a publishing industry that is skittish about the commercial risk that her work demands. This fall, she finally published her third novel, Your Name Here, a metafictional, email-mediated collaboration with the journalist Ilya Gridneff—and it makes The Last Samurai look breezy.

Your Name Here spent nearly 20 years in the book version of development hell: DeWitt and Gridneff began working on it during George W. Bush's second term, after DeWitt was institutionalized following a suicide attempt. For a while, it existed only as a PDF on her website, alongside a suggested-donation link. No publisher would touch it—probably because it is pockmarked with pictures of Theodor Adorno, Google Search results, MSN email signatures, and a complete Arabic alphabet. A series of loosely interpolated, convoluted meta-narratives are plastered like papier-mâché onto the story of a brilliant, suicidal author desperate to write her way out of a profound spiritual and financial funk. According to The New York Times, DeWitt responded to complaints that the book was “hard to follow” by making it even more disorienting.

 In October, the independent publisher Deep Vellum finally made it available as a 607-page brick. It is a novel of permanent, persistent becoming, a story whose endings are multiple and essentially arbitrary, and it takes its own seeming unpublishability as a theme, or perhaps a promise. Reading it, you find yourself in the same position as the people writing it: a state of hovering uncertainty that does not dissipate, even on the final page. “What if. What if. What if,” DeWitt writes, about a third of the way in. “What if I have no idea what happens next?”

In other words, Your Name Here is that dirty word in literary circles today: a challenge. If you believe a heap of essays recently written about the phenomenon, difficult books are read performatively or shown off by “brodernists” eager to impress others with their brainy brawn. Meanwhile, actual market pressures lead in the opposite direction. As I have written before, this era of declining literacy and unsteady sales has led publishers to seek out writing that is summarizable, adaptable, and even, sometimes, readable. Perhaps they're catering to the internet-addled consumer, who may seek out books with simple prose and a straightforward plot.

The narrators of Your Name Here want to capitalize on that preference. The novel tells, among other things, the story of a friendship between Helen DeWitt (at certain points apparently fictionalized as a reclusive, suicidal writer named Rachel Zozanian) and the tabloid journalist Ilya Gridneff. The two meet in a bar, forget about each other, reconnect digitally, and decide to write a novel that will combine DeWitt's autobiographical and metafictional writings with Gridneff's emails. The goal, it seems, is to make a bit of quick money, banking on public interest in DeWitt's/Zozanian's notoriety and Gridneff's gonzo, debaucherous exploits. The story of the novel is also the story of the composition of the novel, an intuitive collaboration between wildly different writers. This is a book that contains pages and pages of full emails, including subject lines, signatures, and the addresses of ancient or defunct hosting companies.

Pitching a book as abstruse as Your Name Here as a kind of cash grab is the novel's wry joke. Yet it speaks sincerely to an obsession of DeWitt's: She has long been consumed by the question of what contemporary society does and does not value, and both she and her characters have struggled with their bills. In the author's note for her 2018 story collection, Some Trick, DeWitt includes a link that would allow the reader to buy her a cup of coffee; The Last Samurai's Sibylla bemoans a world that monetizes everything but the strange, polymathic brilliance displayed by her son; in Your Name Here, DeWitt's doppelgänger, Zozanian, laments all the hours she must spend working odd jobs to make rent.

Yet the real problem for DeWitt is not money but time: Working takes up hours that might be spent in libraries, browsing online, learning new languages, and reading classic texts, all activities foundational to the acquisition of specialized knowledge. But because such activities have marginal monetary value, and educational institutions no longer provide the resources one might need to pursue such research, breakthroughs in knowledge are never made—and great novels are never written. This state of affairs turns seekers of truth such as Zozanian into “shadows of their possible selves,” permanently prevented from attaining full form.

Your Name Here often indulges in such existential pessimism. There is much talk of “the biz,” or rather bizzes of all types: publishing, tabloid journalism, moviemaking, sex work. Yet the novel's essential form openly defies the profit-seeking world. So, yes, it includes the story of the writing of a novel called Your Name Here, often over email, which is at moments (in Gridneff's case) quite tedious. But it also zips among the escapades of Zozanian, a brilliant, cash-strapped Oxford student; chapters from her best-selling novel, Lotteryland; messages from a Hollywood filmmaker who wants to adapt Lotteryland; dispatches from mid-aughts Berlin; the intake form from a Buffalo psychiatric ward; arguments between the co-authors about the subject and shape of the book; and the thoughts of a series of fictional readers who pick up, comment on, and help shape the novel—both the real and fictional versions.

This sounds labyrinthine, but it isn't, not really. DeWitt has constructed not a maze so much as a garden, where many kinds of writing can thrive side by side. The results can be anarchic, even confusing—I was never entirely clear on the precise relationship between DeWitt and Zozanian, or why the Berlin sections are told from one's perspective and not the other's—but they are never simple, blunt, or bland. Like the second-person narrators who pop up to gripe about the book's use of Arabic or comment on its dissimilarity to the works of Anne Tyler, you will often find yourself wondering, What's going on? Where is this going? And like them, if you keep reading, you will play a part in making it cohere.

Your Name Here does not treat readers like passive audience members to whom meaning is dictated. It demands work from them, and brazenly risks being misunderstood. This is a welcome development at a time when authors are starting to compete with the ultimate consumer-friendly writing: AI-generated poetry and prose. The text blobs that chatbots produce are becoming more popular, more accessible, and more lifelike—a reader can have a personally customized novel delivered à la carte in minutes. But AI writings are limited by the prompts used to create them and will always reflect the reader-prompter's existing desires and prejudices, as well as those of the training materials, rather than prodding them to expand. I want my sensibility widened, not pandered to.

Great literature, I would argue, is an active pursuit. It enlists the reader in the act of co-creation and meaning-making. By dramatizing and diversifying its many acts of formation, Your Name Here provides its few but devoted admirers with a surprisingly moving argument for spiky, irregular, even incomplete literature. What emerges is a survival engine—a book that finds its purpose in the collaboration between its co-writers and its readers. That the novel is imperfect, often bewildering, and sometimes a mess is not the point. Its fractured, scattered form, grasping for structure instead of pretending to master it, is an attempt to build a future that will include both author and reader. A simpler book could not do nearly as much.

This is why I try every year to challenge myself. Whatever the limitations of the marketplace, great writing remains as capable as ever of breaking open your sense of the world and your place in it. Reading a novel like Your Name Here, you can come to see that there are no real limits in literature, and fewer in life than you'd expect. And having come to realize that, you might start to wonder along with DeWitt: What if? The real challenge begins.

Zohran Mamdani ran an unabashedly progressive campaign. But how he will govern New York remains something of a mystery.

In the months before the election of the young democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as mayor, panic seized members of New York's elite business community. Real-estate moguls, hedge-fund princes, and a well-known supermarket-chain magnate forecast disaster. Several of them vowed to move to Texas or Florida, or at least Hoboken, if Mamdani was elected. So far, however, the city hasn't seen an exodus of its richest residents, and their alarm has lapsed into glum acceptance.

I recently asked Kathryn Wylde, the soon-to-be-retired president of the Partnership for New York City—a sort of chamber of commerce for finance, real-estate, and tech barons—how her members now view Mamdani. Has anything changed? Wylde, who voted for the new mayor, paused. “I would not say it's positive,” she said. “But those who are at all open to him recognize that he's smart, and they know that their kids voted for him. Now they are waiting to find out who he is.”

Mamdani, who took office shortly after midnight, remains the question-mark mayor. He ran an unabashedly progressive campaign. But he has made a point of talking with potential adversaries; some Partnership for New York City members have met with Mamdani, for example, and he had a surprisingly warm audience with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office in November. How this charismatic 34-year-old will govern the largest city in America is something of a mystery, with three great uncertainties: How will Mamdani manage his relationship with the rich? How will he approach the Israel-Palestine issue? And how will he respond to the influence of his old friends, the Democratic Socialists of America?

Mamdani called his election a “mandate for change,” a claim somewhat belied by the fact that he won with a narrow 50.8 percent of the vote. And he has not backed away from an ambitious and costly economic agenda: He wants to make day care universal and buses free. He also campaigned on shifting the property-tax burden from working-class, outer-borough homeowners to “richer and whiter” neighborhoods. He has promised to accomplish this agenda by taxing the rich and their corporations and townhouses.

Joseph Heath: The populist revolt against cognitive elites

But Mamdani can't afford to alienate the wealthy. Millionaires accounted for $34 billion worth of city and state personal-income-tax revenue as of 2022, according to the Citizens Budget Commission, an influential business-backed nonprofit. The commission found that New York's share of the nation's millionaires shrank from 12.7 percent in 2010 to 8.7 percent in 2022. Had that share stayed steady, the city and state would have collected an additional $13 billion in income taxes.

Mitchell Moss, an urban-planning professor at NYU, told me that moves against the business community could also turn off people who were drawn to New York by the lure of economic opportunity. “Capitalism is built into the fabric of this city,” Moss said. “Why do you think all the immigrants come here?”

But New York's business community might not turn out to be quite as oppositional as some expect. Its members are reasonably civic-minded. Wylde said her flock of CEOs are aware that their companies will suffer if talented people cannot afford to live in the city. And some of them don't take a dire view of all high taxes. Almost two decades ago, the Partnership for New York City endorsed a payroll-tax increase to support mass transit; more recently, it supported a congestion-pricing fee for cars entering New York's central business district.

Mamdani has left the door ajar to negotiation—and compromise—with business leaders and with Governor Kathy Hochul, a centrist Democrat. Of late, he has talked of balancing a rent freeze for tenants with insurance and tax cuts for landlords in working-class neighborhoods. In such moments, he sounds less like Rosa Luxemburg than a more familiar New York type, the liberal social Democrat—not far off from former Mayor David Dinkins or even Michael Bloomberg.

A more fraught question for Mamdani is how he will handle Palestine and Israel. Mamdani has declared that Palestinian liberation is “at the core” of his politics. He founded his college's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, and has said he opposes Israel's identity as a Jewish state. To have a mayor who speaks with antipathy toward Israel and some Jewish Zionist organizations is an unprecedented turn in a city with an estimated 960,000 Jewish residents and three Jewish former mayors.

Mamdani has pledged to order the police to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he sets foot in New York. He recently criticized a prominent synagogue for hosting an event for a nonprofit that encourages immigration to Israel, including to settlements in the West Bank. Under pressure from Jewish leaders, this summer he said he would “discourage” use of the phrase globalize the intifada, though he has said that many people use the phrase simply to show support for Palestinians. Talk of a global intifada took on a chilling resonance this month after two gunmen opened fire on Jews celebrating Hanukkah on Australia's Bondi Beach, killing 15 people.

“Jews have been comfortable in New York City for a long time,” Moss told me. “For the first time, they sense that they are not automatically safe here.”

A liberal financier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he doesn't want to alienate the new mayor, told me that he attended a Mamdani event recently and appreciated that Mamdani listened carefully and took notes. The financier supports Mamdani's commitment to addressing the city's gross inequities. “Personally, I find it difficult to believe that an ambitious man like him is going to die on the hill of the Palestinian struggle,” this person said. “But I have lots and lots of Jewish friends who are freaked out.”

Mamdani's relationship with the Democratic Socialists of America presents the third big question mark. A movement brimming with activist energy and ideological certitude, DSA gave birth to Mamdani's political career, providing the vigor and street organizing that made him such a formidable candidate. He has promised to remain a loyal DSA cadre. Yet that loyalty will be tested when he departs his rent-stabilized apartment in Queens for the two-century-old mayoral mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Already, Mamdani has angered influential DSA members with some of his early decisions.

Derek Thompson: The affordability curse

Five years ago, Mamdani wrote that the city's police department was “wicked” and should be dismantled; this past June, he told Meet the Press that billionaires should not exist. But in November, Mamdani reappointed Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, a centrist technocrat who hails from a family with a fortune valued at $10 billion. Then he pressured DSA not to put up a candidate to challenge House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, whom leftists view as guilty of the sin of moderation.

DSA comrades were not amused. In December, the two national co-chairs of the organization, Ashik Siddique and Megan Romer, appeared on the Dispatches podcast; the episode was titled “Can DSA Hold Mamdani Accountable?” Rania Khalek, the host, asked Siddique's and Romer's view of Tisch, whom Khalek described as coming from “this very billionaire Zionist family.” (Tisch is Jewish.) Neither co-chair challenged Khalek's description of Tisch. “I don't think either of us are happy about keeping somebody like that on,” Siddique said. Romer, a member of a Marxist-Leninst faction within DSA, described Mamdani's decision as “really disappointing.”

In the lead-up to Mamdani's inauguration, some wealthy New Yorkers sounded, if not accommodating, at least resigned to their fate. This past summer, Ricky Sandler, the CEO of a global equity firm, wrote to his fellow oligarchs warning of the “dire consequences” of a Mamdani victory. But the day after Mamdani's election, Sandler proclaimed himself ready to tough out the new socialist administration. “NYC will be worse for yesterday's outcome. Potentially a lot worse,” he wrote. But “I am not planning to move Eminence Capital to another city or state.”

One imagines that such moments of ruling-class resignation could be a minor relief for Mamdani. As for DSA, it has not hesitated to break with prominent progressive politicians, including its most famous member, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; the national DSA withdrew its endorsement of her, at least in part because she took the heretical step of signing a press release supporting a missile-defense system to protect Israeli civilians. Which leaves the strange possibility that New York's first socialist mayor might find himself more threatened by his left flank than by the occasional alienated hedge funder.

Instagram's top executive thinks AI has made the social media site's carefully curated grid a thing of the past.

In an end-of-year message posted on Threads, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that the platform would have to evolve to cope with a coming flood of AI-generated content — and warned that the rise of AI had killed off Instagram's polished aesthetic.

""Unless you're under 25 and use Instagram, you probably think of the app as a feed of square photos. The aesthetic is polished: lots of make up, skin smoothing, high contrast photography, beautiful landscapes,"" wrote Mosseri on Wednesday.

""That feed is dead. People largely stopped sharing personal moments to feed years ago,"" the Meta executive said, adding that users now kept friends updated on their personal lives through unpolished ""shoe shots and unflattering candids"" shared via direct messages.

Mosseri said the growing ubiquity of AI images meant creators would have to embrace this trend, and shy away from curated grids and professional-style photography in favor of a ""more raw aesthetic.""

""Flattering imagery is cheap to produce and boring to consume. People want content that feels real,"" he wrote, adding that social media feeds are starting to fill up with ""synthetic everything.""

Social media platforms like Instagram are grappling with a flood of AI-generated content, with tools like Midjourney and Sora making it easy to produce images and videos of almost anything.

At the same time, Meta has raced to integrate AI tools into Instagram and Facebook. Instagram rolled out an AI studio last year that lets users create custom chatbots, including digital versions of themselves, and has previously experimented with AI Instagram influencers based on real celebrities.

Mosseri said social platforms will get worse at identifying AI-generated media over time as the technology improves, adding that one solution could be for camera companies to cryptographically sign photos when they are taken to prove they are real.

The former Facebook executive said Instagram needed to label AI-generated content clearly, provide more transparency about who is posting on the platform, and build better creative controls so human users could compete with content made entirely by AI.

""For most of my life I could safely assume that the vast majority of photographs or videos that I see are largely accurate captures of moments that happened in real life. This is clearly no longer the case,"" Mosseri wrote.

Amazon is allowing employees who are stranded in India because of visa delays to work remotely there until early March, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.

The catch: They're not allowed to code, make strategic decisions, or interact with customers.

Amazon is one of many American companies scrambling to adapt to the Trump administration's rapid-fire changes to the H-1B visa program, including a mandate that consular officers must review visa applicants' social media posts before issuing visas. The additional screening has delayed processing, and some embassies and consulates have rescheduled visa appointments by several months, leaving some employees stranded outside the country.

The delays have prompted Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other companies to issue travel advisories in recent weeks, warning US employees with visas to avoid international travel to prevent extended stays outside the US.

Amazon allows employees traveling abroad for visa renewals to work remotely for up to 20 business days, an exemption from the normal requirement that they work in their office five days a week. Now, any Amazon employee in India as of December 13 and who awaits a rescheduled visa appointment may work remotely until March 2, according to the memo, which was posted to Amazon's internal HR portal on December 17.

The permission to work remotely comes with a long list of constraints. Employees working remotely from India are barred from coding of any kind, including troubleshooting and testing. They cannot work from or visit Amazon buildings. And they cannot negotiate or sign contracts.

""All reviews, final decision making, and sign offs should be undertaken outside India,"" the memo says.

The memo also said that ""in compliance with local laws, there are no exceptions to these restrictions.""

The memo does not provide guidance for employees whose visa appointments have been rescheduled beyond March 2, 2026, or for those stranded in a different country. Some US embassies and consulates have rescheduled appointments as far out as 2027.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

For employees in technical roles, the restrictions raised questions about what work they can actually perform.

""Seventy to eighty percent of my job is coding, testing, deploying, and documenting,"" one Amazon software engineer told Business Insider.

A State Department spokesperson in December told Business Insider that the purpose of the social media reviews is to use ""all available tools"" to flag visa applicants who are inadmissible, including those who pose a risk to national interests.

The delays pose a particular challenge for Amazon, which is among the largest users of the H-1B program. During the 2024 government fiscal year, Amazon filed 14,783 certified H-1B applications, including 23 for Whole Foods, according to Business Insider's analysis of publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The cities where downsizing will save you the most and least","https://www.businessinsider.com/downsizing-home-which-large-cities-you-save-most-least-2026-1","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 10:42:00 GMT","

When you trade your home for a smaller one, you typically expect smaller monthly bills, too.

But that's not always the case. While in many US cities downsizing will save you big bucks, it could cost you in others, a recent report by StorageCafe found.

Across the country, the average downsizer saves about $200,000 over a decade — more than half the cost of a typical American home.

To create its index, StorageCafe compared the cost of four-bedroom versus two-bedroom homes, factored in a decade of median property tax savings, and subtracted typical closing costs and self-storage costs in about 90 of the country's biggest cities.

Downsizing is the best deal across the South — the report found 13 of the top 20 US cities for downsizing gains relative to home value were in the region. That's in part because suburban home values are on the rise, while Southern cities are building new homes at a quicker pace than most parts of the country.

""In many of these cities, both home prices and general living costs are lower than the national average, which means that the funds freed by downsizing represent a much larger share of the typical local home, and the cash-out is often enough to reset a household's financial footing entirely,"" the report's author, Maria Gatea, wrote.

In Dallas, which topped the list, the typical four-bedroom home costs about $614,000, while the typical two-bedroom costs about $230,000. With tax savings, closing costs, and storage over 10 years factored in, the savings from downsizing were nearly $373,000. Those savings are about 120% of the price of an average Dallas home.

Downsizing also pays off in the Midwest and Rustbelt, where larger homes are selling at a premium and smaller homes are still relatively affordable.

But in cities like Cleveland and Philadelphia, the typical downsizer would lose thousands of dollars by shrinking their square footage. In the Ohio city, the average downsizer would lose about $25,000 over a decade, while in the Pennsylvania metropolis, the loss would be about $6,000.

While downsizing in expensive California cities like Irvine and San Jose means big cash savings, that money doesn't buy as much house as it would in other markets.

As millions of baby boomers hit retirement and think about moving into smaller, more accessible, and more affordable homes, they may want to consider the conditions for downsizing in their area.

But it's not just older people who are downsizing. Many Gen Zers and millennials want to save on housing costs and simplify their lives in smaller abodes — or even tiny homes.

The Slack message from an Amazon employee beta-testing the company's long-delayed Alexa+ was the stuff of nightmares.

""When I ask Alexa to turn off the light, it should turn off the light, not everything on the strip,"" the software engineer wrote in October in a channel for workers to share feedback on unreleased Alexa+ features. ""It turned off the power strip that my aquarium filter is on and killed my fish.""

Other testers complained that the assistant talked non-stop, ignoring repeated commands to be quiet. Or that it played a device at full volume when no one was home.

""The behavior has become unbearably erratic,"" one employee wrote. ""I just wanted to test the new experiences, but I wasn't expecting to get everything messed up.""

The messages highlight the continuing headaches behind Amazon's rollout of Alexa+, a revamped version of its voice assistant that has been marred by years of delays and technical problems. It was released to the public earlier this year, but remains available only to users who request access or use newer devices.

Amazon's Alexa+ beta-tester channel, which in October included more than 6,400 Amazon employees, has served as a candid forum for early testers to share feedback on unreleased Alexa+ features. Those include a more conversational speech mode and a new browser-based version of the AI-powered assistant, which Amazon introduced to the public in December.

Dozens of testers wrote that once they linked the unreleased features to their existing Alexa setups, routine tasks began to break down, turning what was meant to be a smarter assistant into a recurring source of frustration, according to messages that were posted to the Slack channel in October.

Amazon has long promoted a culture that encourages employees to use and critique products internally. Early testing is designed to surface and correct bugs. Business Insider didn't see any comments posted to the channel after October, so it's not clear if some of the issues have been resolved.

The employee feedback in this Slack channel referred to a version of Alexa+ that differs from what's currently available to the public and doesn't reflect the typical customer experience, an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. Tens of millions of users now have access, the spokesperson said, and the ""overwhelming majority"" of feedback has been positive.

""As with any other consumer technology company, it's a standard part of the development process to beta-test products and features internally, well before they're distributed to customers,"" the spokesperson said.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy remains bullish on Alexa+. On a call with analysts in October, he said Alexa+ users tend to have longer interactions with the voice assistant and engage across a wider range of topics than with the older version. Amazon has made Alexa+ free for Prime subscribers, but non-Prime users must pay $19.99 a month.

""We continue to be energized by the response to Alexa+ compared to what we call the classic Alexa experience,"" Jassy said during the call.

Some employees wondered aloud in the Alexa+ Slack channel whether consumers would pay for it.

""All my experiences thus far with Alexa+, inclusive of this one, haven't convinced me that, other than the improved conversation flow, anything would justify paying a subscription fee,"" one staffer wrote.

Beta testers reported on Slack that Alexa+ sometimes failed to respond to voice commands, lost its Wi-Fi connection, or became unresponsive even when it appeared to be online. Some employees said it took up to five minutes to get a response; others reported that their Alexa devices stopped working entirely.

Several employees asked how to opt out of beta testing.

""None of my devices, including the Alexa app, are responsive anymore,"" an employee wrote.

Music playback emerged as a recurring pain point.

""It's so discouraging that we're in Q4 2025 and Alexa+ still can't play a song I ask for,"" one employee wrote.

Another reported that a device began playing music at 3 a.m. He eventually unplugged it.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Molly Ward, a 36-year-old audience manager of a newsroom based in Washington, DC. It's been edited for length and clarity.

I first heard about ""admin nights"" in November, when I came across an Instagram post about them. My understanding is that they're a night to gather with friends and tackle whatever is on your to-do list. It's not necessarily work, just anything that's taking up mental space in your brain.

Coming out of Thanksgiving, I was feeling pretty overwhelmed. I had put off a lot of tasks that I had been wanting to do, and I felt like I hadn't seen a lot of my friends in a while. An admin night seemed like the perfect way to combine both of those activities, so I decided to host one.

People are already texting me about when the next one will be.

I sent out invites on Partiful with a link to an article about admin nights, and people were game. Several people thought it was really funny, and some had clarifying questions, like whether they could do actual work. I didn't want people to feel like they were extending their workday at my house, but I didn't set a ground rule.

My plan was to invite a lot of people, expecting some to drop off, but I think 12 or 13 people showed up. It really showed how interested people were in the concept. I didn't have enough chairs, so some people had to sit on the ground or on the stairs. It really added to the cozy, college-dorm feel, which is something I think people really miss.

I told everyone to dress cozy and bring their favorite snacks. As adults, I think we tend to think we need to provide a full meal for guests, but I thought about it and was like, ""I already have all these tasks I need to get done. I would just be adding another one to my list.""

I put some mulled wine on the stove, but I made it as low-effort as possible for myself. I wasn't trying to be the best hostess of all time.

My friends tend to run late, so it was a little tricky to figure out when to start the first session. People were trickling in for a while and just catching up.

I thought it would be good to provide some structure, so I decided to use intervals: 30 minutes of work and 10 minutes of rest or chat. That being said, I didn't want to be so rigid about the rules that I'd be telling people to put their phones away or stop talking.

Some people continued talking even during working periods, while others returned to their to-do lists. It was kind of a pick-your-own-adventure. I shortened the working period slightly on the third and final round because it seemed like people were getting fatigued, especially since it was a weeknight. After that round, some people hung around to chat for a bit longer before heading out.

After each round, we'd talk about what we knocked out, and it was a real motivator for me to do more in the next round. It was a feedback loop of productivity and motivation that I think we all responded to very well.

I submitted medical paperwork, downgraded a credit card that I had been paying the recurring annual fee for, and cleaned up my Gmail accounts. That one was big. Every time I'd log onto Gmail, I'd get a message saying I was running out of storage, and it would create anxiety, but I never did anything about it.

The momentum to get things done continued after the party. I had people texting me days later telling me they finished up tasks they started at my place, which motivated me to keep going on my to-do list.

The most interesting part of the party was the opportunity it provided for me to learn more about my friends. One friend announced he was actually a Canadian citizen and needed to apply for a passport. Another friend told us they were using the admin party to tackle their living will.

It was a cool way to connect with what's new, what's going on in people's lives. The administrative tasks themselves were boring, but the ideas surrounding those tasks sparked interesting conversations about bigger life ideas.

For this first admin night, I think it was great to let people work on whatever they wanted to, but some of us started tossing around different ideas for the next one. We think it could be cool to have a night dedicated to one task, like canceling subscriptions or doing taxes.

Someone texted me, ""When's the next one?"" I'm thinking it will be in January. I feel like everybody should have an admin night.

Democratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and right-wing Gov. Ron DeSantis agree on virtually nothing. But they found common ground this year as leading skeptics of the artificial intelligence industry's data center boom. 

The alignment of two national figures on the left and right signals that a political reckoning is brewing over the AI industry's impact on electricity prices, grid stability and the labor market. The opposition could slow the industry's development plans if it reaches a broad bipartisan consensus. 

Sanders, I-VT, has called for a national moratorium on data center construction. 

""Frankly, I think you've got to slow this process down,"" Sanders told CNN in a Dec. 28 interview. ""It's not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us it's coming — you adapt. What are they talking about? They're going to guarantee healthcare to all people? What are they going to do when people have no jobs?""

Florida Gov. DeSantis unveiled an AI bill of rights on Dec. 4 that would protect local communities' right to block data center construction among other provisions. The staunch Republican's proposal could run afoul of the White House, which is pushing to scale up AI as quickly as possible. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Dec. 11 to prevent ""excessive state regulation"" of AI.

""We have a limited grid. You do not have enough grid capacity in the United States to do what they're trying to do,"" DeSantis said of the AI industry's data center plans at an event in The Villages, Florida. 

""As more and more information has gotten out, do you want a hyperscale data center in The Villages? Yes or no,"" the governor asked. ""I think most people would say they don't want it."" 

DeSantis is finishing out his second term as Florida's governor and his future political ambitions are unclear. Sanders has said his fourth term as Vermont's senator will likely be his last. 

Florida and Vermont are not major data center states. But rising utility bills played a key role in the landslide victory of Democrat Abigail Spanberger in the governor's race this year in Virginia, the world's largest data center market. 

Residential electricity prices are forecast to rise another 4% on average nationwide in 2026 after increasing about 5% in 2025, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. 

With cost of living at the center of American politics, the impact of data centers on local communities will likely play a role in the mid-term elections next November. 

""We have gone from a period where data centers were sort of seen as an unmitigated good and as an engine of growth by a lot of elected officials and policymakers to people now recognizing that we're short,"" said Abe Silverman, who served as general counsel for the public utility board in New Jersey from 2019 until 2023 under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy. 

""We do not have enough generation to reliably serve existing customers and data centers,"" Silverman said. 

The shortage is most acute on the nation's largest grid, PJM Interconnection, where data center demand is pushing the system to a tipping point. The grid will be six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement by 2027, according to PJM. 

The power shortage is nearly equivalent to the electricity demand of Philadelphia, Silverman said. This makes blackouts more likely, he said. ""Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,"" the analyst said. 

""It's at a crisis stage right now. PJM has never been this short,"" said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, which serves as the independent market monitor for PJM.  

PJM Interconnection serves more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. It includes pivotal swing states for the mid-term elections like Pennsylvania and Virginia. 

The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are ultimately passed on to consumers. This amounts to a ""massive wealth transfer,"" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.  

""I don't think we've seen the end of the political repercussions,"" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. 

""And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we'll see a lot of implications,"" Gramlich said. ""Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents' policies would raise rates."" 

The shortage will be exacerbated by Trump's recent decision to pause all offshore wind farms under construction off the East Coast, Silverman said. This includes Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a massive 2.6 gigawatt project that would help supply the huge data center market in northern Virginia.

""By stopping a project that had line of sight to coming online in the very near future, you are directly increasing the prices that we all pay for electricity and not by a little bit,"" Silverman said. ""That's a huge, huge additional hole that we now have to dig out of.""

Data centers are facing pushback on multiple fronts now. The PJM watchdog has called for the grid to reject data centers that it does not have the power to serve or require them to bring their own generation. Virginia's utility regulator is now requiring data centers to pay a majority of the cost of new transmission and generation that serves them beginning in 2027. 

Data center developers next year will likely start moving to build more power plants onsite, called co-location, as they struggle to secure supply on the grid quickly, said Brian Fitzsimons, CEO of GridUnity, a company that uses software to help utilities navigate connection requests. 

But Silverman said ""co-location"" has problems that will also face political scrutiny.  

""Co-location is effectively taking a generator off the market,"" he said. ""It would be unethical to end up with a situation where data centers are able to buy private power plants that expose the rest of us to a greater chance of blackouts.""

Student loan borrowers whose debt is canceled in 2026 or later may face a significant tax bill. 

A law that shielded student loan forgiveness from taxation at the federal level — part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 — expired on Dec. 31, 2025. President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" did not extend or make permanent that provision.

As a result, certain borrowers who've recently received education debt cancellation or expect to do so in the future should take steps as soon as possible to be prepared, experts say. 

The taxation change applies to the Department of Education's income-driven repayment plans, or IDRs. Enacted in the 90s, IDR plans cap people's monthly payments at a share of their discretionary income and excuse any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 or 25 years.

""A lot of people are very close to their 20- or 25-year mark,"" said Ethan Miller, a certified financial planner and founder of Planning for Progress in the Washington area. Miller specializes in student loans. 

""Those are the folks who really need to be thinking about how the so-called tax bomb ... is going to impact them,"" he said.  

Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a program for government and nonprofit employees that eliminates federal loans after 120 qualifying monthly payments, remains tax-free.  

The federal tax bill on student loan forgiveness could be substantial. The average loan balance for borrowers enrolled in an IDR plan is around $57,000, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.

For those in the 22% tax bracket, having that amount forgiven would trigger a tax burden of more than $12,000, Kantrowitz estimated. Lower earners, or those in the 12% tax bracket, would still owe around $7,000.

Plus, some borrowers could incur state tax liability on their forgiven balance, experts say.   

More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion.

The new potential tax liability comes at the same time many student loan borrowers have faced delays in accessing debt forgiveness. But in a recent settlement between the American Federation of Teachers and the Trump administration, Education Department officials clarified that borrowers who became eligible for student loan forgiveness in 2025 won't owe federal taxes on the relief, even if their debt isn't officially discharged until later. 

That means if you received confirmation that you're eligible for debt cancellation in 2025, you should save that dated record, said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.

You may be able to use that document to prove you were entitled to the relief before the tax-free provision lapsed, Nierman said.

Starting in 2026, student loan forgiveness counts as income, which could ""thrust your tax bracket up,"" depending on the size of your eliminated balance, said CFP and certified student loan professional Landon Warmund with Reliant Financial Services in Kansas City, Missouri.

That could increase your tax bill and impact eligibility for various deductions and credits, he said. 

""The biggest thing that I'm stressing for borrowers is that if you know this is going to come, be proactive with the planning,"" said Warmund, who is also a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council. 

First, you'll need to know when you're eligible for IDR plan forgiveness. That could now be harder without the tracking tool previously available on StudentAid.gov, which was removed earlier this year, experts say. 

The Education Department ""currently has no plans to resume using the tool,"" according to a December court filing.  

However, you can work with an advisor to figure out when you are eligible for forgiveness and start estimating the tax impact, depending on that year's income. Then you can begin setting money aside and explore IRS payment plan options. 

""You need to be prepared for these tax liabilities,"" Warmund said. But you can ""get ahead of it and plan accordingly.""

Italy's foreign ministry said on Thursday the United States had sharply lowered proposed duties on several Italian pasta makers following a reassessment of their U.S. activities.

In October, the United States said that 13 Italian pasta companies would face an extra 92% duty — on top of the regular 15% rate on most EU imports — from January 2026, accusing two producers in particular, La Molisana and Garofalo, of selling pasta at unfairly low prices.

The United States collected more $200 billion in tariffs in 2025 as a result of new duties, according to Customs and Border Protection. 

However, after a review, the U.S. Department of Commerce cut the tariff for La Molisana to 2.26%, while Garofalo's rate was set at 13.98%, the Italian foreign ministry said in a statement.

The remaining 11 producers, which were not individually examined in the review, face a tariff of 9.09%.

""The recalculation of the duties is a sign that U.S. authorities recognise our companies' constructive willingness to cooperate,"" the foreign ministry said.

It added that the full conclusions of the U.S. review would be released on March 11, adding that the ministry would continue to provide help to the companies affected in the coming weeks.

The threatened pasta tariffs had been an embarrassment to Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who had hoped that her close ties with U.S. President Donald Trump would shield Italian companies from any additional tariffs.

Italy's total pasta exports were worth over 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) in 2024, according to data from national statistics agency ISTAT. The U.S. market was worth almost $800 million to Italian firms.

Toward the end of the year, many of us commit to ambitious, concrete goals like cutting your screen time in half or running three miles every morning.

That approach often backfires, according to neuroscientist Anne-Laure Le Cunff, PhD.

Linear goals like these are popular because they give people ""the illusion of certainty,"" according to Le Cunff, author of ""Tiny Experiments: How to Live Freely in a Goal-Obsessed World.""

""They make us feel like we're in control, because we think that if we have a clear vision and a clear plan, and we execute on that plan, then we're going to be successful,"" she tells CNBC Make It.

But real life rarely adheres to our best-laid plans, which is why so many people end up repeating their New Year's resolutions ""over and over again every year"" without making progress, she says.

Instead, she recommends approaching your goals with an ""experimental mindset."" Just like scientists collect data and use the results to inform their next choices, ""you can do the exact same thing with your career and your life in general.""

If you're hoping to start a new routine this year, Le Cunff recommends conducting ""tiny experiments"" with the habits you'd like to try, instead of setting lofty, unrealistic goals.

Tiny experiments follow a very simple formula, according to Le Cunff: ""I will [do X action] for [Y duration].""

Some examples could be ""I will write 250 words every day for two weeks,"" or, ""I will take a walk on my lunch break every day for one month.""

One of Le Cunff's favorites is, ""I will not bring my phone into my bedroom for one week."" 

A good tiny experiment meets four criteria, according to Le Cunff: It must be ""purposeful, actionable, continuous and trackable."" 

To be purposeful, the experiment has to involve something you are ""deeply curious about,"" Le Cunff says, and an actionable experiment is one that you can conduct ""right now with your current resources.""

It's crucial to run the experiment continuously in order to collect enough data, she explains, and tracking your consistency will help you determine how well the experiment is working for you.

The key is to ""withhold judgment until you're done conducting your experiment,"" Le Cunff says. Trying something new can be uncomfortable, but that's part of the process.

After the experiment is over, you can decide whether or not you would like to incorporate that action into your daily life. ""You can actually use experiments as a gateway to discover new habits that work for you,"" Le Cunff says.

Many of us have a tendency ""to always want to go for the bigger, more impressive, more ambitious version of a goal,"" Le Cunff says, but that mentality has several pitfalls. For one, long-ranging goals like ""I will work out every day this year"" or ""I will read one book a week"" are often ""too overwhelming or unrealistic.""

Announcing your impressive goal to other people gives your brain a ""big dopamine hit,"" Le Cunff says, but that can paradoxically reduce your motivation to achieve it. After all, ""we already got the reward of people telling us, 'Oh wow, you're so strong, you're so ambitious.'""

By contrast, telling others 'I'm going to jog twice a week for one month' may sound less impressive than 'I'm going to run every day for the next year,' but ""then you actually get the very healthy dopamine at the end from actually having done the thing,"" Le Cunff says.

Tiny experiments help shift people from an outcome-based mindset to a curious, explorative one. With this perspective, ""success is not reaching a particular milestone that you have defined in advance. Success is learning something new,"" she says.

Many U.S. workers are ringing in the new year with a raise as new minimum wage increases take effect in states and localities across the country on Thursday.

More than 8.3 million workers are expected to benefit from minimum wage hikes in 19 states, which will collectively add an estimated $5 billion in earnings nationwide, according to a December report by the Economic Policy Institute.

On top of changes to state minimum wages, many cities and municipalities with local wage standards increased their minimum wages Thursday as well. For example, Seattle's minimum wage rose to $21.30 an hour, and the minimum wage in Minneapolis is now $16.37 an hour.

Minimum wage workers in Hawaii will see the largest jump in their hourly pay. The state's minimum wage rose by $2 per hour, from $14 to $16. Other states with minimum wage increases include Arizona, California, Michigan, New Jersey and New York.

The federal minimum wage remains at $7.25 an hour, where it has stood since 2009. Minimum wage levels vary widely depending on where workers live, with state and local laws often setting significantly higher standards.

Zohran Mamdani was sworn in as New York City mayor in the first minutes of the New Year at the historic City Hall subway station, with his wife Rama Duwaji standing by his side.

The oath, in which he pledged to support the Constitution of the United States and the laws of New York, was administered by New York State Attorney General Letitia James.

""Happy New Year to New Yorkers, both inside this tunnel and above,"" said Mamdani, standing beneath a vaulted ceiling with the words City Hall over his head. ""This is truly an honor and a privilege of a lifetime.""     

Mamdani was a trailblazing candidate and is expected by many in his city of 8 million  -- some with hope, some with trepidation -- to be a disruptive mayor.

The democratic socialist's plans for his first day in office on Thursday nod to his politics and priorities, without straying far from his predecessors with a sober official midnight oath-taking followed by a more celebratory ceremony in the afternoon.

New York law spells out that four-year mayoral terms start on the January 1 after elections. To avoid any ambiguity about who's in charge of America's most populous city, it has become a tradition to hold a small swearing-in just after midnight.

Mamdani chose the Old City Hall subway stop, which was decommissioned in the middle of the previous century and is accessible only a few times a year through guided tours, as the site of his swearing in.         

The subway site, according to Mamdani's transition team, reflects his ""commitment to the working people who keep our city running every day.""

Mamdani, a 34-year-old former state lawmaker, promised a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for his Democratic Party around the country ahead of midterm elections.

Mamdani inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than 2 million voters and took 50 percent, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa.    

Attorney General James was among his earliest prominent backers. During the first administration of President Donald Trump, James began investigating his business practices in New York, resulting in a judge finding in 2024 that Trump fraudulently overstated his net worth to dupe lenders.

The Trump administration has targeted James during his second term, accusing her of mortgage fraud.     

Grant Reeher, a Syracuse University political science professor, said James's role in the inauguration would send a message to core supporters that Mamdani is ""going to be independent of the president.""         

The Uganda-born Mamdani, who will be New York City's first Muslim mayor, has been a sharp critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and said his differences with the president were numerous after a warm White House meeting.

But being sworn-in by the state attorney general may say more about Mamdani's political alliances than rivalries. 

In 2014 Bill de Blasio, whom Mamdani regards as the best New York City mayor of his lifetime, was sworn in privately by then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman at the start of the first of his two terms.  

Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive, Brooklyn-born Vermont senator whom Mamdani calls his inspiration, presided over de Blasio's public inauguration ceremony in 2018 and will play a similar role for Mamdani.

Liberal Democratic U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is also on the inauguration ceremony agenda.

Plans for Mamdani's public inauguration include a ceremony on City Hall's steps and a program of music and speeches in front of 4,000 guests gathered in City Hall Plaza. 

In addition, tens of thousands of people will be able to watch a livestream of what Mamdani's team has dubbed the ""Inauguration of a New Era"" in free viewing areas set up along Broadway.

Mamdani raised $2.6 million for the transition and celebrations from nearly 30,000 contributors, more than other mayors on record this century, both by the total and single donations, according to official campaign data that presents disclosures of inaugural expenses beginning with Michael Bloomberg's first term in 2001.

Sami Zaman, the owner of Astoria's low-key Afghan restaurant Sami's Kabab House, where Astoria resident Mamdani filmed a campaign video with Sanders, was on the inaugural committee alongside filmmakers, writers and activists.

After becoming mayor, Mamdani will move from his one-bedroom Astoria apartment, protected from sharp price hikes by the city rent-stabilization program, to Gracie Mansion, the official residence of New York City mayors on Manhattan's upscale Upper East Side.

Bankers and others in New York, the nation's financial capital, had expressed concern about Mamdani but since his election many have explored how to work with him.

The city has had another mayor associated with democratic socialism, David Dinkins. Dinkins did not make much of his association with the Democratic Socialists of America. 

During his 1990-1993 term he overcame budget deficits and persuaded private businesses to remain in New York, according to city archivists.

Dozens of people were killed and around 100 injured, most of them seriously, after fire tore through a crowded bar during a New Year's Eve party in the upscale Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana, officials said on Thursday.

Fire broke out at 1.30 a.m. (0030 GMT) in a bar called ""Le Constellation"" in the resort in southwestern Switzerland, which locals said was popular with teenagers. The cause of the blaze, which was initially reported as an explosion, remains unclear. Authorities said it appeared to be an accident rather than an attack.

Swiss police said ""tens"" of people were presumed dead with around 100 injured, and the Italian foreign ministry said information from Swiss police indicated about 40 deaths. Swiss officials declined to give a specific figure.

""There were people screaming, and then people lying on the ground, probably dead,"" said 21-year-old local Samuel Rapp, who saw the aftermath of the fire. ""They had jackets over their faces—well, that's what I saw, nothing more.""

Video footage showed lines of ambulances queuing and helicopters landing to take victims to nearby hospitals and specialist burns units in other Swiss cities.

Two young French women who said they were in the bar told France's BFM TV that they saw the fire start in the basement section of the club after a bottle containing ""birthday candles"" was held up too close to the wooden ceiling.

""The fire spread across the ceiling super quickly,"" one of the two women, who identified themselves as Emma and Albane, told BFM TV. The pair said they were able to climb a narrow staircase to the ground floor and escape the building. Minutes later, the fire had reached the ground floor too, they said.

BFM showed video of a waitress carrying a champagne bottle with a lit 'fountain candle' through the bar, in line with the account, but the video did not show the fire taking hold.

Video footage verified by Reuters showed fire spreading from the building, with people outside the club, some of them running and screaming.

Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told Sky TG24 local authorities had told him the blaze was started by someone letting off a firework inside the bar which set fire to the ceiling. He was in Crans-Montana, where he said a number of Italians had gathered seeking information about missing relatives or friends.

He declined to say if there were any Italian victims but witnesses said many of those in the bar appeared to be from other countries.

Witnesses described injured being treated in improvised triage centres set up in a nearby bar and in a branch of UBS bank and said many suffered after coming out of the heat of the bar into the freezing night air.

""And then it was just ambulances coming back and forth as much as possible,"" said Dominic Dubois, who witnessed the frantic scenes as the bodies were brought out.

A waiter in a restaurant near to the bar who declined to be named said that first responders approached staff overnight asking for table cloths to cover the bodies to conceal them from onlookers.

On Thursday morning, hours after the explosion, footage from the street outside showed the area cordoned off, with forensic tents behind white screens set up in front of the bar, one of many in Crans-Montana, a fashionable ski centre with an array of boutiques, luxury hotels and restaurants.

""I know someone who might have been among the victims and I can't reach her. I'm very worried,"" said local resident Karine Spreng. ""I'm going to try to contact other people who know this woman to see if she is still alive.""

The daytime scene, with small groups of people, some in tears or carrying flowers, was a stark contrast to the panic and confusion that officials said faced first responders who arrived when the alarm was raised.

""The first responders — the firefighters and police officers — arrived at a scene of chaos, at a dramatic scene,"" Stephane Ganzer, head of security for Valais canton, told reporters.

He said some of the victims were from other countries, hundreds of personnel were working on the case and a helpline had been opened for relatives. Officials said the grim task of identifying badly burned bodies would take a considerable time.

""I can't hide from you that we are all shaken by what happened overnight in Crans,"" the canton's head of police, Frederic Gisler, told the press conference. ""Our count is about 100 injured, most seriously, and unfortunately tens of people are presumed dead,"" he said, adding that patients had been dispatched to hospitals in Sion, Lausanne, Geneva and Zurich.

Local prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said a full investigation had been opened into the incident at the bar, which Swiss company records indicated was owned by a French couple.

""At the moment we are considering this a fire and we are not considering the possibility of an attack,"" she told a press conference.

Swiss Federal President Guy Parmelin expressed shock at the scale of the disaster, which came less than a year after a fire in a club in North Macedonia killed 59 people.

""What was meant to be a moment of joy turned, on the first day of the year in Crans-Montana, into mourning that touches the entire country and far beyond,"" he said on the social media platform X, expressing condolences.

The foreign ministers of neighboring Italy and Germany and other countries including the United States expressed condolences but there was no immediate confirmation of the nationality of any of the victims.

Prosecutor Pilloud said authorities were trying to get the bodies of the victims to their families.

""A lot of resources have been put into forensics to identify the victims. These resources are intended to allow us to get the bodies to the families as soon as possible,"" she said.

Earlier, police said many people were being treated for burns and that the area had been completely closed off, with a no-fly zone imposed over Crans-Montana, which is due to host next year's Alpine World Ski Championships. Authorities said 10 helicopters and 40 ambulances had been deployed.

Beginning January 1, 2026, an estimated 6.1 million more Americans will be eligible to open and contribute to Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts, according to National Disability Institute.

ABLE accounts are tax-advantaged investment accounts designed for Americans with disabilities. Created by Congress in 2014, ABLE accounts allow beneficiaries to save for qualified expenses like education, housing, health care and more without affecting their Medicaid or Social Security income eligibility. 

Previously, beneficiaries had to have a qualifying medical condition that began before their 26th birthday, but that cut-off rises to age 46 as of January 1 due to the ABLE Age Adjustment Act passed in 2022. The expanded age requirement brings the total number of Americans eligible to open ABLE accounts up to around 14 million, per NDI's estimates.

ABLE accounts are ""a powerful wealth planning, financial and tax planning vehicle,"" Juliana Crist, head of ABLE programs at Vestwell, a financial technology company that manages 19 of the country's ABLE plans, tells CNBC Make It. Crist describes it as ""kind of a super-powered Roth"" individual retirement account.

As with Roth IRAs, contributions to ABLE accounts are made with after-tax dollars. Beneficiaries can invest the money in a portfolio which grows tax-free, and qualified withdrawals are not subject to income taxes. But with ABLE accounts, beneficiaries can set aside more money per year and can use the funds whenever they want, rather than needing to wait until they hit a certain age. 

ABLE account withdrawals for qualified expenses are not taxed as income. However, withdrawals for non-qualifying expenses are subject to income tax and a 10% penalty.

Account holders can have up to $100,000 saved in an ABLE account without losing access to Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid benefits. Individuals with savings exceeding $2,000 in regular savings or other investment accounts risk losing those benefits.

Here's how ABLE accounts work and who can open one.

ABLE accounts are available to U.S. citizens in all 50 states who are either eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance or can self-certify that they have a qualifying medical condition. 

""A lot more people can qualify for an ABLE account than realize it,"" Crist says. ""People hear that this is an account for people with disabilities, and that person might actually have a qualifying medical condition, but they don't think of it as a disability ... a lot of our eligible people just don't realize that this could be a tool they could even use.""

To self-certify, individuals must have a written diagnosis of a qualifying condition signed by a licensed physician that also confirms the onset of the condition was before the individual's 46th birthday. 

Qualifying conditions include blindness, as defined by the Social Security Administration, along with a variety of other physical and mental conditions such as Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Individuals do not have to provide proof of diagnosis when opening an ABLE account, but they need to certify that they have one, according to ABLE National Resource Center.

Beneficiaries can contribute up to $20,000 a year into an ABLE account in 2026. Individuals who work but do not contribute to a workplace retirement plan can contribute an additional amount equal to the individual poverty threshold — $15,650 in 2026 — or up to their employment earnings, whichever is less. That limit rises to $19,550 for Alaska residents and $17,990 for Hawaii residents in 2026. 

Virtually anyone can contribute to a beneficiary's ABLE account including parents and other family members or employers. But total contributions may not exceed the annual limit.

Nearly every state and Washington, D.C. sponsor ABLE accounts and most allow out-of-state participation, according to ABLE NRC. Four states — Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin — don't have their own plans. Depending on where you live and your personal financial situation, it may make sense to shop around between different states' plans — a search which could benefit from the help of a financial professional.

If you're looking to open an ABLE account, Crist suggests starting your search with your home state's plan if one is available. That's because some states offer state income tax deductions for ABLE account contributions.

Plus, ""sometimes it's easier and more familiar to be able to reach out to a person in your own backyard if you have questions or you need support,"" she adds.

From there, you'll want to compare investment options and costs for different ABLE accounts. Generally, ABLE accounts have management fees that can run around $30 a year, Crist says. The plans also may charge a fee equal to 0.1% to 0.3% of assets in your account she says. Some plans offer more investment options than others, which could be a deciding factor.

""Some states have much larger investment menus, like 15 options to choose from, as opposed to some states only offer four investment options to choose from — simple versus complex, so that can appeal to different types of savers and investors,"" Crist says.

If you want a debit card attached to your account, some plans offer that as well, but not all, she adds.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Vitalik Buterin on the two goals Ethereum must meet to become the ‘world computer'","https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2026/01/01/vitalik-buterin-on-the-two-goals-ethereum-must-meet-to-become-the-world-computer","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 16:07:10 GMT","

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin used a New Year's message on Thursday to reflect on a year of major technical progress — and to argue that the network's real test lies in fulfilling its original mission, not in chasing the latest crypto narratives.

In his New Year's post on X, Buterin said Ethereum made meaningful progress in 2025 by becoming faster, more reliable and better able to handle growth without sacrificing its decentralized design. He pointed to improvements that allow the network to process more activity, reduce bottlenecks and make it easier for people to run the software that keeps Ethereum operating. 

Taken together, he said, those changes move Ethereum closer to becoming a new kind of shared computing platform rather than just another blockchain.

But Buterin was clear that technical milestones alone are not the end goal.

“Ethereum needs to do more to meet its own stated goals,” he wrote, cautioning against what he described as efforts to “win the next meta,” whether through tokenized dollars, political memecoins or attempts to artificially boost network usage for economic signaling.

Instead, Buterin returned to a long-standing vision of Ethereum as a “world computer” — a shared, neutral platform for applications that can operate without reliance on centralized intermediaries.

That vision, he believes, centers on applications designed to function without fraud, censorship or third-party control, even if their original developers disappear. Buterin pointed to the “walkaway test,” the idea that systems should continue running regardless of who maintains them, as a core benchmark. He also emphasized resilience, arguing that users should not notice if major infrastructure providers go offline or are compromised.

These properties, he suggested, once described everyday tools before the rise of subscription-based digital services that lock users into centralized platforms. “Ethereum is the rebellion against this,” Buterin wrote.

To succeed, he argued, Ethereum must meet two requirements simultaneously: it must be usable on a global scale, and it must remain genuinely decentralized. That challenge applies not only to the blockchain itself, including the software people use to run nodes and interact with the network, but also to applications built on top of it, which often depend on centralized services despite using decentralized protocols.

Buterin acknowledged that progress is already underway and noted that powerful tools now exist to push the effort further. His message was less a road map for a single upgrade than a reminder of why recent technical work matters at all: to position Ethereum as durable infrastructure for finance, identity, governance and other foundational internet services.

Whether Ethereum can meet those ambitions will become clearer as the network's next phase shifts from upgrades to real-world use, testing how its ideals hold up under scale.

Written by Aaryamann Shrivastava

Edited by Harsh Notariya

Ethereum price has moved sideways since late December 2025, struggling to establish a clear trend. ETH has repeatedly tested resistance without confirmation. 

Despite muted price action, sentiment across several investor cohorts has improved, suggesting consolidation may be nearing an end as market confidence slowly rebuilds.

Ethereum ETFs closed 2025 on a constructive note after a volatile December. Spot ETH ETFs recorded combined inflows of $67 million, reversing nearly two weeks of steady outflows. This shift indicates renewed institutional interest following a period of risk aversion driven by macroeconomic uncertainty.

The inflows suggest macro investors may be repositioning for the new year. While December sentiment remained cautious, early 2026 flows imply improving expectations for Ethereum price performance. ETF activity often reflects longer-term conviction, reinforcing the view that downside pressure may be weakening across broader market participants.

On-chain data support the improving sentiment narrative. Coin Days Destroyed, or CDD, showed only one notable spike throughout December. Outside of that event, the indicator remained subdued, signaling limited distribution activity among long-term holders.

CDD measures how long-held coins move on-chain, often highlighting selling by experienced investors. Ethereum LTHs appear unwilling to offload positions despite ETH failing to reclaim $3,000 for over two weeks. This behavior suggests confidence in higher future valuations and reduces near-term supply pressure.

Ethereum trades near $2,975 at the time of writing, holding just below the $3,000 resistance. This level has capped price advances for most of December 2025. A sustained break above it remains critical for confirming a renewed bullish structure.

Positive holder sentiment could help Ethereum price push above $3,000 during the first week of 2026. Continued accumulation and stable ETF inflows may provide sufficient momentum. A confirmed breakout could allow the Ethereum price to target $3,131, aligning with previous resistance turned potential support.

However, downside risks persist amid uncertain market conditions. A broader market pullback could trigger an ETH price correction toward $2,902. Increased selling pressure may extend losses to $2,796, which would invalidate the bullish outlook and shift focus back to defensive positioning.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Scaramucci Picks His Top 3 Crypto Altcoins As Rate-Cut Tailwinds Build","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:f68f159d3094b:0-scaramucci-picks-his-top-3-crypto-altcoins-as-rate-cut-tailwinds-build/","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 09:00:56 GMT","

Anthony Scaramucci says a friendlier US policy mix: rate cuts, looser financial conditions, and a renewed push for crypto legislation could set up 2026 as a better tape for “quality” altcoins, even after what he described as an unexpectedly bruising 2025 for the sector.

In a Dec. 31 interview with Altcoin Daily, the SkyBridge Capital founder framed 2025 as a year where positioning and sentiment broke down under selling pressure he said he didn't anticipate. “There's probably $4.6 billion of whale selling this year into the ETF demand,” Scaramucci said, arguing that the deleveraging event around Oct. 10 amplified the move.

“There was a massive amount of deleveraging. It impacted some of the market makers. It forced a liquidity crisis,” he added, describing a 30% drop as “garden variety” for bitcoin, but still a surprise for traders leaning bullish.

Scaramucci said he now sees the setup improving precisely because sentiment turned so negative. “We were tilted to the bulls, we're now decidedly very bearish,” he said, claiming his internal “bull meter” sits around 13 or 14 out of 100. The flip side, he argued, is that incremental good news, less large-holder selling, steadier ETF inflows, or regulatory progress, could matter more than usual.

A central part of Scaramucci's thesis was that the market still expects US market-structure legislation to pass, and that the timeline matters. “I do think it is detrimental because I do think there is still a market expectation that it's going to pass. I do think you need that clarity,” he said of the Clarity Act.

Without it, he argued, serious tokenization efforts remain constrained by legal uncertainty: “Who's going to spend the kind of money that you need to switch over the financial system if you're not guaranteed that you're going to be able to use it.”

He also tied the policy fight to a broader economic claim: “There's between, depending on how you measure it, there's three and a half to $4 trillion dollars worth of transaction verification expenses in the global economy per year… If you could get that down, let's say you cut it in half, you could unleash a $2 trillion capital spend in other areas of the economy or just better wages for people.”

Pressed on odds of passage before the midterms, Scaramucci said it should be “north of 50%,” arguing Democrats have learned there is “no anti-crypto voter,” while crypto-aligned spending can be decisive in tight races.

Scaramucci's Top-3 Altcoins And Bitcoin Prediction

Asked for his current top-three altcoins, Scaramucci named Solana first, followed by Avalanche and Telegram-linked TON. “My three top coins then would be Solana, it would be Avalanche and believe it or not… it would be the Telegram token known as Ton,” he said, while acknowledging he has been early or wrong on timing.

He said he first bought TON at $7.50, averaging near $4.00, while saying it was trading around $1.50 at the time of the interview, but still sees it as a token that could be used across Telegram's network as it grows.

On why Solana sits at No. 1, Scaramucci kept it simple and comparative: “Cheap, low cost, very fast, easy to use, easy to develop on,” he said, adding he's “not an Ethereum negative person” and expects “a multicoin world.”

Macro is the other pillar. Scaramucci expects “two to four interest rate cuts” next year and argued a president facing midterms will want growth optics. “He's going to flood the zone with capital. He's going to drop interest rates. He's going to try to perk up the economy,” Scaramucci said. “That bodes well for the stock market… for the altcoin market… and… for crypto.”

For bitcoin, he stuck with his $150,000 call—“I'm off by a year, I think”—and said he recently “bought more Bitcoin” for his family, betting that ETF flows and easier policy can overpower the hangover from 2025's whale-driven selling.

At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $2.94 trillion.

Trade Finance Innovation: How Blockchain and Fintech Are…

The global trade ecosystem is undergoing a digital revolution, and nowhere is this transformation more evident than in cross-border payments and trade finance. For decades, businesses have faced long settlement times, high transaction costs, and complex documentation when trading internationally. Traditional trade finance systems, reliant on paper-based processes and intermediaries often slowed down global commerce, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

However, the rise of blockchain technology and financial technology (fintech) innovations is reshaping the way money and data move across borders. By improving transparency, speed, and efficiency, these technologies are not only making trade finance more accessible but also redefining the foundation of global trade.

Trade finance, the system that enables importers and exporters to conduct business smoothly has long been hindered by outdated infrastructure. Letters of credit, documentation verification, and compliance checks often involve multiple intermediaries, resulting in delays and high administrative costs.

Banks, insurers, and trade bodies typically oversee these transactions to ensure trust between parties that might not know each other personally. While this system reduces risk, it also creates inefficiencies. On average, cross-border payments can take three to five business days to process, with fees ranging between 3% to 7% of the transaction value.

For smaller businesses, these barriers can significantly restrict international participation. The need for more transparent, faster, and inclusive trade finance mechanisms has pushed the industry toward digital transformation and this is where blockchain and fintech are playing a game-changing role.

At the core of blockchain's impact on trade finance is its ability to create a secure, decentralized, and immutable ledger that records every transaction transparently. Unlike traditional systems, where each participant maintains separate records, blockchain ensures that all stakeholders including banks, suppliers, and buyers share a single source of truth.

This transparency dramatically reduces the risk of fraud and errors, two major concerns in international trade. It also minimizes the need for intermediaries by enabling smart contracts, self-executing agreements coded on the blockchain that automatically trigger payment or document release once predefined conditions are met.

For example, in a blockchain-enabled trade transaction, once goods are confirmed as shipped and received, payment can be automatically released to the supplier without waiting for manual verification. This automation reduces settlement times from days to mere minutes, increasing both efficiency and liquidity.

Global institutions are already experimenting with blockchain-based trade finance platforms. Initiatives like we.trade, Marco Polo Network, and Contour are enabling banks and corporates to conduct secure, paperless trade using blockchain technology. These platforms are transforming traditional letters of credit into fully digital, real-time systems that ensure both trust and speed.

While blockchain provides the foundation for transparency and automation, fintech companies are making cross-border payments more accessible, affordable, and user-friendly. Through digital platforms and mobile applications, fintech firms are removing the friction historically associated with international transactions.

Unlike traditional banks, fintech payment providers leverage technology to offer real-time currency conversion, instant settlement, and reduced fees. Companies like Wise, Revolut, and Ripple are enabling businesses to send and receive money globally with minimal cost and maximum speed.

Moreover, fintech innovation is empowering SMEs to access trade finance services that were once limited to large corporations. Digital lending platforms use alternative data such as transaction history, supply chain performance, and trade volumes to assess creditworthiness. This data-driven approach allows smaller businesses to obtain working capital and participate in global markets without facing the constraints of traditional banking.

Fintech solutions also integrate AI and machine learning to detect anomalies, prevent fraud, and ensure compliance with international regulations. This blend of innovation and automation is helping to create a more secure, inclusive, and dynamic trade finance environment.

The real transformation lies in the convergence of blockchain and fintech, as these technologies complement each other's strengths. Blockchain provides trust and transparency, while fintech enhances accessibility and user experience. Together, they are creating a seamless trade finance ecosystem that bridges the gap between traditional banking and digital innovation.

For example, blockchain-enabled fintech platforms can offer instant cross-border settlements that are verifiable and traceable, reducing counterparty risk. Such systems also facilitate regulatory compliance by recording transactions on immutable ledgers, providing auditors and regulators with real-time insights.

This synergy also holds immense potential for emerging markets, where infrastructure limitations have traditionally hindered trade finance access. With digital trade platforms and blockchain integration, even small exporters can engage in secure, low-cost international trade without heavy documentation or intermediaries.

Despite its promise, the transition to blockchain- and fintech-based trade finance is not without challenges. The lack of standardized regulations, limited interoperability between blockchain platforms, and concerns around data privacy have slowed widespread adoption. Additionally, the integration of new technologies into existing financial systems requires significant investment and collaboration across industries.

However, as global institutions, governments, and fintech startups continue to collaborate, these barriers are gradually being addressed. The future of trade finance lies in open, interoperable systems that connect businesses, banks, and regulators through digital infrastructure.

Blockchain and fintech are redefining the fundamentals of cross-border trade and finance, replacing outdated systems with faster, transparent, and more secure digital alternatives. By automating trust, reducing transaction costs, and improving access to capital, these technologies are democratizing global trade for businesses of all sizes.

As adoption accelerates, the next generation of trade finance will be defined by transparency, speed, and inclusivity, fostering stronger connections between global economies. In this new era, technology will not just facilitate trade but it will empower it, paving the way for a smarter, more efficient, and sustainable global financial ecosystem.

Blockchain technology is changing how we handle money, data, and even everyday services. As crypto markets rebound and big companies adopt blockchain, investors are turning to blockchain stocks for growth. These are shares in public companies that make money from blockchain, crypto mining, exchanges, or related tech. They offer a way to invest in blockchain without buying coins directly.

Right now, trading volume is spiking for some top names. High volume means more buyers and sellers, which can signal big moves ahead. In this post, we dive into the top 3 blockchain stocks with the highest recent dollar trading volume. These picks – Core Scientific (CORZ), Figure Technology Solutions (FIGR), and Globant (GLOB) – stand out for their strong ties to blockchain and potential for gains. Let's break them down.

Core Scientific leads in digital asset mining across North America. They run data centers that mine Bitcoin and other cryptos. Their business splits into two main parts: Mining (where they mine for themselves) and Hosting (where they help other miners with equipment setup, monitoring, fixes, and upkeep).

Why watch CORZ now? Mining stocks like this one thrive when Bitcoin prices rise or mining gets more efficient. With crypto prices climbing lately, Core Scientific's facilities are buzzing. They offer blockchain infrastructure and software too, making them a full-service player. High trading volume shows investors betting on their expansion as more firms outsource mining.

If you're into crypto exposure through stocks, CORZ is a direct play on mining's future.

Figure is using blockchain to build the next era of capital markets. Their tech handles lending, trading, and investing in consumer credit and digital assets. By applying blockchain ledgers, they speed up processes, cut costs, boost liquidity, and standardize deals.

What makes FIGR exciting? Traditional finance is slow and expensive. Figure's blockchain fixes that with secure, fast transactions. They're not just in crypto – they're blending it with real-world finance like home loans and investments. As blockchain goes mainstream, companies like Figure could see huge adoption from banks and investors.

FIGR offers a bridge between old finance and blockchain innovation – perfect for long-term holders.

Globant provides tech services worldwide, with a big focus on digital solutions. They cover blockchain, cloud, AI, cybersecurity, IoT, metaverse, and more. They also help enterprises with tools from AWS, Google Cloud, Salesforce, and others, plus custom Agile setups and process tweaks.

Why is GLOB a blockchain stock to follow? They're not pure-play crypto, but blockchain is core to their offerings. As companies rush to integrate distributed ledgers for supply chains, payments, and data security, Globant's expertise shines. Their global reach means they're working with Fortune 500 firms on blockchain projects.

GLOB gives diversified exposure – blockchain growth without full crypto volatility.

These three top the charts for recent dollar volume among blockchain stocks. CORZ is purest crypto, FIGR blends finance, and GLOB adds stability.

Blockchain stocks can deliver big returns as adoption grows. Think faster payments, secure data, and new markets like DeFi. But watch out for:

Still, with Bitcoin ETFs approved and enterprises testing blockchain, 2025 looks bright. These high-volume picks are where action is happening.

The top 3 blockchain stocks – CORZ, FIGR, and GLOB – are must-watches this week. High trading volume means momentum is building. Do your own research, check charts, and consider your risk tolerance. Blockchain is evolving fast – don't miss the ride.

Let's uncover why the NFT market saw explosive growth in 2025 even as sales fell sharply. What changed for creators and buyers?

Summary is AI generated, newsroom reviewed.

The NFT market crossed 1.34 billion tokens in 2025 despite lower total sales value

NFT sales decline reflects cautious buyer behavior and reduced speculative demand

Average NFT prices dropped as the market repriced risk and improved accessibility

Long-term growth now depends on utility, engagement, and sustainable value creation

The NFT market delivered a striking contradiction in 2025. Token supply reached record levels while buyer spending declined sharply. According to CryptoSlam data, the total number of NFT tokens crossed 1.34 billion during the year. At the same time, total NFT sales dropped 37 percent year over year to $5.6 billion.

This shift highlights a market that continues to grow in size but struggles with value retention. More creators launched collections across blockchains. More platforms enabled minting with lower barriers. However, demand failed to keep pace with supply, creating pressure across prices and volumes.

The NFT market now stands at an important crossroads. Participants no longer measure success by token counts alone. Investors, creators, and marketplaces increasingly focus on sustainable demand, real utility, and long-term engagement rather than speculation-driven hype.

The NFT market experienced unprecedented expansion in token issuance during 2025. Easier minting tools, lower gas fees, and wider blockchain adoption encouraged creators worldwide. Artists, brands, gaming studios, and independent developers launched NFTs at record speed.

Layer 2 networks and alternative blockchains played a key role in this surge. Platforms reduced costs and simplified onboarding for new users. As a result, creators no longer needed technical expertise or large budgets to enter the NFT market.

However, rapid token creation introduced a new challenge. Oversupply diluted attention and liquidity across collections. Many NFTs struggled to gain visibility, leaving buyers overwhelmed with options and cautious about purchases.

Despite higher participation, NFT sales decline defined the market narrative in 2025. Total transaction value fell to $5.6 billion, marking one of the steepest annual drops since the NFT boom. Buyers no longer chased speculative flips at scale.

Macroeconomic pressure influenced this trend. Higher interest rates and tighter liquidity reduced risk appetite across digital assets. Investors prioritized capital preservation over experimental purchases within the NFT market.

The NFT sales decline also reflected maturity. Buyers now evaluate utility, community strength, and long-term relevance. Collections without clear value propositions struggled to maintain traction in a more selective environment.

Average NFT prices fell to $96 in 2025, down from $124 the previous year. This decline signals a broader market repricing rather than a collapse. Buyers adjusted expectations as speculative premiums faded.

The NFT market now values accessibility over exclusivity. Lower prices enabled new participants to enter without significant capital. This shift expanded audience reach but reduced headline-grabbing sales numbers.

Creators also adapted pricing strategies. Many launched lower-priced editions to attract engagement and build communities. While average NFT prices declined, transaction counts remained relatively resilient in active segments.

The NFT market increasingly rewards projects that deliver clear utility. Gaming assets, membership passes, and brand-linked NFTs performed better than purely artistic releases. Buyers expect experiences rather than static ownership.

Community engagement now drives value creation. Successful collections offer events, governance rights, or ongoing content access. This trend reshaped how creators design and market NFTs.

Projects that failed to evolve struggled to survive. The NFT market no longer supports passive launches without post-mint engagement. Builders must deliver consistent value to retain attention and liquidity.

The NFT market in 2025 tells a story of transformation. Token growth reflects innovation and accessibility. Falling sales highlight the need for stronger fundamentals.

Market participants who adapt to changing expectations will thrive. Utility-driven projects, engaged communities, and transparent platforms define the next phase of NFT adoption. Rather than fading, the NFT market evolves into a more disciplined and value-focused ecosystem.

Let's uncover SEI stablecoin growth and why $13M in December signals rising confidence across the SEI network. What's driving demand?

Summary is AI generated, newsroom reviewed.

SEI stablecoin growth added over $13 million during December, reflecting rising user confidence

SEI network activity increased alongside stablecoin inflows, supporting organic ecosystem expansion

Crypto liquidity inflows favored SEI due to speed, efficiency, and reliability

December's data positions SEI strongly for continued adoption and developer interest

SEI stablecoin growth gained serious momentum in December as the network added over $13 million in supply. This expansion reflects increasing trust in SEI's infrastructure. Market participants now view the network as a viable liquidity layer. Developers and traders continue to explore its growing on-chain utility.

This rise did not happen in isolation. Broader market conditions favored networks offering speed and capital efficiency. SEI delivered both during a volatile period. Users actively shifted assets toward stablecoins for protection and flexibility. SEI benefited from this defensive yet strategic allocation.

SEI stablecoin growth also highlights changing user behavior across emerging Layer 1 ecosystems. Investors now seek reliability instead of hype. Stablecoins provide predictable value movement during uncertainty. SEI positioned itself well during this transition. December numbers now validate that positioning.

Stablecoins act as the backbone of crypto liquidity during uncertain phases. Traders rely on them for fast repositioning. They also help reduce exposure to sudden volatility. Networks hosting strong stablecoin ecosystems often gain lasting relevance. SEI continues to follow this proven pattern.

SEI stablecoin growth reflects this deeper role within market infrastructure. Users park value on-chain while waiting for opportunities. Protocols benefit from increased transaction volume. Developers gain consistent activity without speculative spikes. This balance strengthens long-term network health.

Crypto liquidity inflows often reveal early confidence shifts. December data suggests growing trust toward SEI. Investors did not merely speculate. They deployed capital intentionally through stable assets. This behavior usually precedes broader ecosystem expansion.

SEI network activity directly fuels stablecoin demand across the ecosystem. Each transaction strengthens liquidity circulation. Active wallets encourage deeper market participation. Developers build confidently on active chains. SEI continues to deliver consistent engagement metrics.

Higher network activity improves capital velocity. Stablecoins move faster between protocols. This flexibility attracts liquidity providers. It also reduces idle capital risks. SEI benefits as activity compounds organically.

Crypto liquidity inflows often follow user engagement trends. SEI showed strong engagement before December. Stablecoin growth now reflects that groundwork. This sequence aligns with mature ecosystem development. Sustainable growth usually follows this pattern.

Developers gain a more reliable base layer through SEI stablecoin growth. Stable liquidity supports application scalability. Projects avoid sharp capital fluctuations. This stability encourages long-term product planning. SEI offers an increasingly attractive environment.

Investors view stablecoin growth as a risk management signal. It indicates cautious optimism. Capital enters without excessive speculation. This behavior often precedes renewed asset deployment. SEI appears positioned for that next phase.

SEI network activity continues to reinforce investor confidence. Transparent metrics strengthen decision-making. December's data provided clarity. Clear data builds stronger narratives. SEI now benefits from that transparency.

SEI now enters the new year with positive momentum. Stablecoin growth sets a strong foundation. Continued SEI network activity could accelerate adoption. Developers may introduce new financial products. Liquidity expansion often unlocks innovation.

Crypto liquidity inflows may increase further if market confidence improves. SEI stands ready to absorb that capital. Infrastructure readiness matters during growth phases. SEI already demonstrated reliability. That readiness could drive future inflows.

SEI stablecoin growth reflects preparation rather than chance. Networks succeed through consistent execution. December confirmed SEI's execution strength. The coming months will test scalability. Early signals remain encouraging.

While stablecoins have gained more than $100 billion in 2025 to peak at $307 billion according to DefiLlama, India is taking the opposite direction. The Indian central bank (RBI) states that only a sovereign digital currency guarantees monetary stability. In a global landscape where CBDCs struggle to impose themselves, New Delhi erects the e-rupee as a bulwark against the privatization of money.

In its financial stability report published at the end of December 2025, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) takes a clear stance: CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) should be favored over stablecoins issued by private actors.

The institution considers CBDCs as the foundation for the future national and international monetary system. According to the report, the sovereign digital currency alone can guarantee “the uniqueness of currency and the integrity of the financial system”. It must remain “the ultimate settlement asset” and serve “as an anchor for confidence in the currency”.

These statements fit into a vision of strong monetary sovereignty, in which any delegation of currency issuance to non-state entities would lead to imbalances.

The RBI also issues an explicit warning against the risks associated with stablecoins, which it perceives as a potential threat to financial stability, especially during periods of market stress. It emphasizes that states must carefully evaluate “the risks associated” and adapt their monetary policy accordingly.

Here are the key points highlighted by the Central Bank :

In summary, the Indian central bank does not simply favor CBDCs. It considers that strict regulation, even marginalization of private stablecoins, is essential to protect the current monetary architecture.

As the Indian central bank toughens its stance, stablecoins are experiencing rapid growth worldwide, notably driven by their adoption in cross-border transfers.

According to DefiLlama, their capitalization rose from $205 to $307 billion in 2025, evidence of their perceived utility in the financial system. On-chain data indicate this growth relies largely on the interest of many American, European, and Asian financial institutions, attracted by the speed and low cost of these assets compared to traditional financial infrastructures.

Yet, despite the market's enthusiasm for these private instruments, only three CBDCs are currently active worldwide: those of Nigeria, the Bahamas, and Jamaica, according to data from the Atlantic Council.

Forty-nine countries are in the pilot phase, twenty are currently developing their technology, and thirty-six others are only at the research stage. This gap between the market momentum for stablecoins and the slow development of CBDCs highlights a paradox: the Indian central bank advocates for a solution still largely experimental, even as real uses lean towards private solutions.

The stablecoins market reaches a record of $310.11 billion, but India maintains its stance: priority for state currency. This strategic choice reflects a will for strict monetary control facing an innovation still considered unstable. A posture that could redefine the balance between financial sovereignty and digital future.

US Representative Warren Davidson warns the US is drifting toward a permissioned and heavily surveilled financial system, arguing that recent crypto legislation undermines the industry's original promise of permissionless, private money. 

In a post on X on Wednesday, Davidson criticized the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, arguing it enables a wholesale version of a US dollar central bank digital currency (CBDC) that could be used for “surveillance, coercion, and control.”

He also fears a digital ID system will be rolled out that forces Americans to get government permission to use their own money.

“Do not be deceived,” Davidson said.

“We need to reject this globalist surveillance state and return to first principles,” he added, reminding his 86,600 X followers that Bitcoin's original promise was less about being an illiquid, inflation-hedging asset, and more about being a permissionless, peer-to-peer payment system. 

Davidson has been one of the fiercest advocates of permissionless money, self-custody and privacy in Congress since the Republican began representing Ohio in 2016. He has introduced various legislation aimed at restricting state control over crypto, criminalizing CBDCs and even one that sought to fire then Securities and Exchange Commission chair, Gary Gensler.

Davidson isn't alone in this fight

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene said she voted no to the GENIUS Act, arguing that it hands power over to the banks while opening a “back door” for a CBDC.

“The real danger lies in Digital ID, CBDC, and no self custody,” Greene said, echoing Davidson's remarks.

CLARITY Act more promising, but its impact may be limited

Both Davidson and Greene appeared more supportive of the CLARITY Act, which is awaiting passage in the Senate and is expected to be marked up in early 2026.

“CLARITY promises to fix some of the deficiencies in GENIUS by protecting self-custody and incorporating other House provisions,” Davidson said.

But with the GENIUS Act in effect, Davidson said any changes to individual freedom coming from the CLARITY Act will be largely cosmetic.

The Reserve Bank of India has urged countries to focus on central bank digital currencies over privately-issued stablecoins, citing concerns about financial stability.

In its December financial stability report, released on Wednesday, the RBI argued that CBDCs preserve the “singleness of money and the integrity of the financial system,” and should remain as the “ultimate settlement asset” and the “anchor for trust in money.”

The RBI also argues that introducing stablecoins can create new channels for financial stability risks, particularly during periods of market stress, and that it's “vital that jurisdictions carefully assess the attendant risks and determine policy responses appropriate to its financial system.”

The government of India indicated in its Economic Survey 2025-2026 that it was considering regulations for stablecoins, while the RBI advocated a more cautious approach to crypto. 

Central banks often shape the rules of money through policy and regulation, and the RBI will likely play a key role in how crypto is treated in India.

RBI says CBDCs are like stablecoins, but better

CBDCs are a hotly debated issue. Critics are concerned CBDCs could infringe on privacy and undermine the financial sector by allowing users to become direct customers of central banks, while advocates argue that CBDCs could improve payment efficiency and expand financial inclusion.

In its latest financial stability report, the RBI said CBDCs can achieve all the same benefits stablecoins offer, efficiency, programmability, and instant settlement, but with the credibility and safety of central bank money.

“The RBI maintains a cautious stance on crypto assets, including stablecoins, prioritising sovereign digital infrastructure to safeguard monetary sovereignty amid global shifts and preserve financial stability,” the bank said in the report.

A range of financial institutions across the US, Europe, and Asia are moving into stablecoins for benefits such as faster, lower-cost transfers compared to traditional finance rails.

The interest has seen the market capitalization of the sector continue to grow, starting in 2025 at around $205 billion and ending the year at $307 billion, according to data aggregator DefiLlama. 

CBDC adoption is slow around the world

Despite interest from some banks and governments, only three CBDCs have been launched so far, according to the American think tank, the Atlantic Council.

Its CBDC tracker lists Nigeria, the Bahamas and Jamaica as the only three jurisdictions with an active CBDC token, while another 49 countries are in the pilot phase, 20 are listed as developing the technology, and 36 are researching it.

ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan(AP) — Turkmenistan, one of the world's most isolated nations, officially legalized mining and exchanging cryptocurrency on Thursday in a major shift for the country's tightly controlled, gas-dependent economy.

Signed by President Serdar Berdimuhamedov, the legislation regulating virtual assets brings cryptocurrencies under civil law and establishes a licensing scheme for cryptocurrency exchanges overseen by the country's central bank. 

However, digital currencies will still not be recognized as a means of payment, currency, or security. Turkmenistan's internet also remains tightly regulated and controlled by the government. 

Turkmenistan, a former Soviet country in Central Asia, relies heavily on the export of its vast natural gas reserves to support its economy. China is the country's main importer of gas, and Turkmenistan is currently working on a pipeline to supply gas to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.

Turkmenistan also adopted a law introducing electronic visas in April last year, aimed at simplifying entry for foreigners. After gaining independence in 1991, the autocratic nation typically placed strict entry requirements on would-be visitors, with many visa applications turned down for unclear reasons.

                    Trump launched a meme coin called $TRUMP, which reached more than $14.5 billion in ‍market value before crashing [File]

Trump Media and Technology Group said on Wednesday ​it will distribute a new digital token to its ‌shareholders, deepening its push into digital ​assets as policy support for cryptocurrencies builds in Washington.

Shares of the company linked to U.S. President Donald Trump, which operates his social media platform Truth Social, were last up 5% in early trading.

Cryptocurrencies have become a recurring feature of the family's business empire, with ​critics pointing to potential conflicts of interest given ⁠Trump's pledge to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.”

Since his return to the White House in January, the ​climate for crypto businesses has ⁠turned more favourable, with legislation passed in the summer to cover parts of the sector. Several enforcement cases were abandoned.

Trump courted industry cash on the ‌campaign trail by pledging to be a “crypto president,” while ‌his family's own crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial, have helped push the sector further ‍into the mainstream.

Days before his inauguration, Trump launched a meme coin called $TRUMP, which reached more than $14.5 billion in ‍market value before crashing.

The White House has rejected allegations of conflicts of interest, saying Trump's multibillion-dollar real estate, golf, media and other business interests are held in a trust managed by his children.

DJT shareholders will receive one new digital token for each share they hold, the company said, with more details on the launch expected ⁠in 2026.

The new token is expected to operate on the Cronos blockchain.

The launch comes amid ​a downturn in crypto prices, with bitcoin down 6% this ⁠year and heading for its first annual loss since 2022.

The pullback reflects a broader shift away from risk as investors cut exposure to more volatile assets.

Synopsis: Trump Media will distribute blockchain tokens to DJT shareholders via Crypto.com's Cronos blockchain, offering rewards like discounts and special access to company products.

Trump Media and Technology Group stunned markets Wednesday with plans to distribute blockchain tokens to its shareholders. The parent company of Truth Social will issue one digital token for every share of DJT stock held. This marks a groundbreaking move that blends traditional equity with cryptocurrency rewards.

The announcement sent ripples through both stock and crypto markets. DJT shares climbed 3.18% to $12.97 in pre-market trading following the news. Crypto.com's native CRO token initially surged 3.8% before settling back. The company plans to roll out additional details about the token program in early 2026.

Trump Media partnered with Crypto.com to build the token on its Cronos blockchain. Shareholders will receive tokens based on a simple one-to-one ratio. Each whole share of DJT stock equals one digital token.

The token offers something different from traditional shareholder benefits. Token holders may receive periodic rewards throughout the year. These perks could include discounts and special access to Trump Media products. The company's portfolio spans Truth Social, the Truth+ streaming service, and Truth Predict.

CEO Devin Nunes emphasized the innovative nature of this distribution model. “We look forward to utilizing Crypto.com's blockchain technology and improving regulatory clarity,” Nunes stated. He added that this first-of-its-kind token distribution aims to reward shareholders fairly. The program promotes transparent markets while leveraging emerging technology.

However, the token does not represent actual equity in Trump Media. Holders will not gain voting rights or claims on company earnings. The digital asset tracks alongside the stock but serves primarily as a rewards mechanism.

President Donald Trump holds majority ownership in Trump Media and Technology Group. He has voiced strong support for the cryptocurrency industry throughout 2025. In November, Trump declared his vision for America to become a “bitcoin superpower.”

This presidential endorsement adds weight to the company's blockchain initiative. The token distribution aligns with Trump's broader crypto-friendly stance. It signals confidence in digital assets as legitimate business tools.

The timing proves significant for the crypto industry. Therefore, Trump Media's move could encourage other publicly traded companies to explore similar programs. The model demonstrates how blockchain can enhance shareholder value beyond traditional dividends.

Trump Media confirmed that shareholders must hold whole shares to qualify for tokens. Fractional shares will not count toward the distribution. The company will announce specific eligibility dates and distribution timelines in the coming weeks.

The Cronos blockchain provides the technical infrastructure for the token. This choice ensures compatibility with Crypto.com's ecosystem. Shareholders can likely manage their tokens through Crypto.com's platform or compatible wallets.

Meanwhile, the rewards structure remains flexible and evolving. Trump Media indicated that benefits may change periodically. Shareholders could see discounts on Truth Social subscriptions or exclusive Truth+ content. Truth Predict users might receive special features or promotional offers.

The company stressed that token ownership differs fundamentally from stock ownership. Tokens do not grant access to financial information or company decisions. They serve purely as a loyalty program enhanced by blockchain technology.

The market reacted positively to the announcement despite some initial volatility. DJT stock maintained gains throughout pre-market trading. Crypto.com's CRO token showed similar enthusiasm before stabilizing.

Industry experts view this as a test case for tokenized rewards programs. Several companies have explored similar concepts with mixed results. Robinhood faced criticism in June for offering tokenized private equity without traditional ownership rights.

Trump Media's approach differs by clearly stating the token's limitations upfront. The company explicitly confirmed tokens do not represent equity stakes. This transparency may help avoid regulatory confusion or shareholder disputes.

The program showcases how traditional companies can adopt blockchain without fully tokenizing securities. It creates a middle ground between conventional shareholder perks and cryptocurrency investments. Other corporations may follow this model to engage tech-savvy investors.

Trump Media expects to provide comprehensive program details by early 2026. Shareholders await information about distribution dates, wallet requirements, and specific reward structures. The success of this initiative could reshape how public companies interact with shareholders in the digital age.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin used a New Year's message on Thursday to reflect on a year of major technical progress — and to argue that the network's real test lies in fulfilling its original mission, not in chasing the latest crypto narratives.

In his New Year's post on X, Buterin said Ethereum made meaningful progress in 2025 by becoming faster, more reliable and better able to handle growth without sacrificing its decentralized design. He pointed to improvements that allow the network to process more activity, reduce bottlenecks and make it easier for people to run the software that keeps Ethereum operating. 

Taken together, he said, those changes move Ethereum closer to becoming a new kind of shared computing platform rather than just another blockchain.

But Buterin was clear that technical milestones alone are not the end goal.

“Ethereum needs to do more to meet its own stated goals,” he wrote, cautioning against what he described as efforts to “win the next meta,” whether through tokenized dollars, political memecoins or attempts to artificially boost network usage for economic signaling.

Instead, Buterin returned to a long-standing vision of Ethereum as a “world computer” — a shared, neutral platform for applications that can operate without reliance on centralized intermediaries.

That vision, he believes, centers on applications designed to function without fraud, censorship or third-party control, even if their original developers disappear. Buterin pointed to the “walkaway test,” the idea that systems should continue running regardless of who maintains them, as a core benchmark. He also emphasized resilience, arguing that users should not notice if major infrastructure providers go offline or are compromised.

These properties, he suggested, once described everyday tools before the rise of subscription-based digital services that lock users into centralized platforms. “Ethereum is the rebellion against this,” Buterin wrote.

To succeed, he argued, Ethereum must meet two requirements simultaneously: it must be usable on a global scale, and it must remain genuinely decentralized. That challenge applies not only to the blockchain itself, including the software people use to run nodes and interact with the network, but also to applications built on top of it, which often depend on centralized services despite using decentralized protocols.

Buterin acknowledged that progress is already underway and noted that powerful tools now exist to push the effort further. His message was less a road map for a single upgrade than a reminder of why recent technical work matters at all: to position Ethereum as durable infrastructure for finance, identity, governance and other foundational internet services.

Whether Ethereum can meet those ambitions will become clearer as the network's next phase shifts from upgrades to real-world use, testing how its ideals hold up under scale.

A new study unexpectedly reveals that cells thrive on chaos.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Across the sciences, rules and laws help us make sense of the world around us, whether applied to cosmic scales or subatomic ones. However, in the biological world, things are a bit more complicated. That's because nature is often full of biological exceptions, and so “rules of biology” are also considered broad generalizations rather than absolute facts that explain and govern all known life. 

Some of these broad generalizations include things like Allen's Law, which dictates that body shapes in endotherms (warm-blooded animals) adapt to climatic conditions—short and stocky helps retain heat in cold climates, while tall and lanky helps dissipate heat in warmer ones. Another “law,” known as Bergmann's rule, states that species of a broadly distributed clade tend to be larger in colder climates and smaller in warmer ones (though of course, as with most biological rules, exceptions apply). 

Some two dozen or so rules currently exist that describe all kinds of processes of the natural world, and now, researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) hope to add a new rule. At first glance, this new rule—called “selectively advantageous instability,” or SAI—seems to defy the underpinning assumptions of life in general, and pushes against the current assumption that life craves stability and a conservation of resources. 

While nature does tend toward stability (it's one reason why we see so many hexagonal shapes in the wild, including honeycombs and insect eyes), USC molecular biologist John Towers argues that instability in biological components like proteins and genes can actually be helpful to cells. The study was published last week in the journal Frontiers in Aging. 

“Even the simplest cells contain proteases and nucleases and regularly degrade and replace their proteins and RNAs, indicating that SAI is essential for life,” Tower said in a press statement. “This can favor the maintenance of both a normal gene and a gene mutation in the same cell population, if the normal gene is favorable in one cell state and the gene mutation is favorable in the other cell state.”

These states allow for greater genetic diversity, which in turn can make organisms more adaptable. Many cell components also favor a short lifespan, as this actually helps promote cell health. This indicates that SAI in these components is a necessary biological function. 

Of course, there are plenty of downsides to instability. This energy-requiring process of mutation instability can introduce deleterious cells that contribute to aging, while also inducing other types of damage and dysfunction. 

“Aging has proven to be difficult to define, but most definitions include an increased chance of death with age, and decreased reproductive fitness with age,” the paper reads. “SAI can create a cost for the replicator in terms of energy and/or materials, and this cost might be interpreted in terms of promoting aging.”

Another piece of evidence supporting SAI's ubiquity and its candidacy as a new “rule of biology” is that it crops up in other well-known concepts, including chaos theory and ideas of “cellular consciousness.” Because of this—as well as its links to fundamental biological processes like aging—understanding the inner workings of SAI could help biologists explore cellular life in a whole new way.

This new propulsion system could rewrite the rules of spaceflight—not to mention completely defy conventional physics.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In 2001, British Electrical Engineer Roger Shawyer first introduced the “impossible drive,” known as the EmDrive. It was called “impossible” because its creator purported that the drive was reactionless, meaning no propellant required—in other words, it defied the known laws of physics (specifically, the conservation of momentum). 

As with anything that appears to thumb its nose at Newton and Einstein, scientists raised more than a few eyebrows, and two decades of testing eventually boiled down to an inevitable (and somewhat predictable) conclusion in 2021: the EmDrive was bunk. But that's the nature of the scientific method—take a seemingly impossible idea, put it through rigorous testing, and hopefully get to an unassailable conclusion (or new discoveries that lead in other directions). 

The not-based-in-physics dream of a propellant-less machine, however, didn't die with the EmDrive. Instead, a new challenger approaches, and this one has a former NASA scientist backing it up. 

While at NASA, Charles Buhler helped establish the Electrostatics and Surface Physics Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center in Florida—a very important lab that basically ensures rockets don't explode. Now, as co-founder of the space company Exodus Propulsion Technologies, Buhler told the website The Debrief that they've created a drive powered by a “New Force” outside our current known laws of physics, giving the propellant-less drive enough boost to overcome gravity. 

“The most important message to convey to the public is that a major discovery occurred,” Buhler told The Debrief. “This discovery of a New Force is fundamental in that electric fields alone can generate a sustainable force onto an object and allow center-of-mass translation of said object without expelling mass.” 

Buhler stressed that this work is unaffiliated with NASA, and that he recently presented his findings at the Alternative Propulsion Energy Conference (APEC), which is a club of engineers and enthusiasts eager to find ways to overcome the limitations of gravity and physics—and not always with the most scientifically sound methods.  

In an interview with APEC's co-founder Tim Ventura, Buhler explained how his background in electrostatics led to the discovery. He says his team—made up of people from NASA, Blue Origin, and the Air Force—investigated propellant-less drives for decades before arriving at electrostatics. For years, their devices produced negligible thrust, but saw increases with each new iteration. This culminated in 2023, when this “New Force”-powered drive generated enough thrust to overcome Earth's gravity. 

“Essentially, what we've discovered is that systems that contain an asymmetry in either electrostatic pressure or some kind of electrostatic divergent field can give a system of a center of mass a non-zero force component,” Buhler told The Debrief. “So, what that basically means is that there's some underlying physics that can essentially place force on an object should those two constraints be met.”

Obviously Buhler's claims are pretty “woah, if true,” but the history of propellant-less drives is filled with seemingly positive results that are eventually dashed upon the rocks of scientific reality. For the EmDrive, hopes for the device skyrocketed after NASA's Eagleworks team, which is dedicated to investigating new forms of propulsion (i.e. warp drives), claimed to measure thrust from the “impossible” drive in 2016. However, subsequent studies—including an exhaustive (no pun intended) one at the Dresden University of Technology—found zero thrust. 

Before any alternative propulsion enthusiasts should start popping corks, rigorous, third-party research will have to verify the results again and again. While it's not impossible that Buhler et. al stumbled across some unknown quirk of physics, it's an extremely unlikely outcome. 

For now, let's call it an “improbable engine.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Nearly 70% of U.S. adults could now be classified as obese","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251227004140.htm","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 03:51:14 GMT","

A newly proposed definition of obesity could significantly increase the number of Americans considered to have the condition. According to researchers at Mass General Brigham, applying updated criteria developed earlier this year by the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology Commission raises the estimated obesity rate in the United States from about 40 percent to nearly 70 percent. The study examined data from more than 300,000 people and found that the increase was especially pronounced among older adults. The findings also showed that many individuals newly classified under the updated definition face higher risks of serious health problems. The study was published in JAMA Network Open.

""We already thought we had an obesity epidemic, but this is astounding,"" said co-first author Lindsay Fourman, MD, an endocrinologist in the Metabolism Unit in the Endocrinology Division of the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine. ""With potentially 70 percent of the adult population now considered to have excess fat, we need to better understand what treatment approaches to prioritize.""

Why BMI Alone May Miss Health Risks

For decades, obesity has primarily been defined using body mass index (BMI), a calculation based on height and weight. While BMI offers a simple estimate, it does not capture how fat is distributed throughout the body. Other anthropomorphic measures -- including waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, and waist-to-hip ratio -- can provide additional insight by distinguishing fat mass from muscle and identifying abdominal fat linked to disease risk.

Under the updated framework, obesity is identified in two main ways. Individuals with a high BMI plus at least one elevated anthropometric measure are classified as having obesity, a category the authors call ""BMI-plus-anthropometric obesity."" People with a normal BMI can also be classified as having obesity if they have at least two elevated anthropometric measures, referred to as ""anthropometric-only obesity."" The guidelines further separate obesity into preclinical and clinical forms, with clinical obesity defined by obesity-related physical impairment or organ dysfunction. The new standards have already been endorsed by at least 76 organizations, including the American Heart Association and The Obesity Society.

Study Data Show a Sharp Rise in Obesity Rates

Researchers analyzed participants from the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program, which includes more than 300,000 Americans. Using the new definition, 68.6 percent of participants met the criteria for obesity, compared with 42.9 percent under the traditional BMI-based approach. The entire increase was attributed to individuals classified as having anthropometric-only obesity. Obesity rates differed across sex and race, but age showed the largest effect, with nearly 80 percent of adults over 70 meeting the new criteria.

Higher Health Risks in Newly Identified Groups

The study also found that people with anthropometric-only obesity, who would not have been labeled as having obesity under older standards, had higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality compared with individuals without obesity. Roughly half of all participants who met the new obesity definition were categorized as having clinical obesity. This percentage was only slightly lower among those with anthropometric-only obesity than among those with BMI-plus-anthropometric obesity.

""We have always recognized the limitations of BMI as a single marker for obesity because it doesn't take into account body fat distribution,"" said senior author Steven Grinspoon, MD, Chief of the Metabolism Unit in the Endocrinology Division of the Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine. ""Seeing an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in this new group of people with obesity, who were not considered to have obesity before, brings up interesting questions about obesity medications and other therapeutics.""

What This Means for Treatment and Future Research

The researchers note that additional studies are needed to better understand why anthropometric-only obesity develops and which treatments may be most effective. The team has previously developed a therapy aimed at reducing waist circumference and plans to evaluate how different treatment strategies might benefit this newly defined group.

""Identifying excess body fat is very important as we're finding that even people with a normal BMI but with abdominal fat accumulation are at increased health risk,"" Fourman said. ""Body composition matters -- it's not just pounds on a scale.""

Authorship: In addition to Fourman and Grinspoon, Mass General Brigham authors include Aya Awwad, Camille A. Dash, Julia E. Johnson, Allison K. Thistle, Nikhita Chahal, Sara L. Stockman, Mabel Toribio, Chika Anekwe, and Arijeet K. Gattu. Additional authors include Alba Gutiérrez-Sacristán.

Forget about New Year's resolutions. Instead, dedicate your New Year's Day to completing a few simple tech chores that will make you feel instantly better about the state of your digital life.

The first four are very quick and simple, and the last six take a little more time but can still be done in less than an hour.

How long has it been since you emptied the trash on your desktop? Start off with this dead simple, two-click task and bask in the motivation you feel to continue with your clean-up list.

Listen up, tab hoarders! Today is the day you free yourself of the browser window from hell. If you're reluctant to let go of all your opened tabs, consider bookmarking them first. In Chrome, go to Bookmarks > Bookmark All Tabs and move on with your life. Delete your browsing data, too, on both desktop and mobile devices.

It's time to blow out all the crumbs and lint from your keyboard. Grab a can of compressed air and work its magic on your keyboard or laptop. You can also clean all the ports on your laptop, phone, and tablet while you're at it.

When was the last time you actually saw your virtual desktop? Take all the loose files and move them to a folder. If you're not sure where to start, make a folder called ""2025 and older"" and dump everything in there.

If you have a little more time, even just 10 minutes, sort your files in whatever way makes the most sense for you. There's no right way to do it. There's only the way that helps you find what you need.

It seems easier and faster to press delete than to unsubscribe from unwanted emails. But then more emails keep coming. Make January 1 the day you invest an extra 15 seconds per message to fully remove yourself from some email lists.

If you have a soft spot in your heart for emails with deals and discounts, consider setting up an alias address for them. That way, you can keep deals emails totally separate from personal messages, bank notices, updates from your kids' school, and other important information. The reason I prefer using an email alias rather than using your real address and letting deal emails go to a dedicated folder or tab is because of what happens when companies sell your information to a third party. If you get scammy messages that look like they're coming from your bank, but they are going to your email alias, you don't have to sleuth around to figure out if they're legitimate—they're not.

Do you have photos on your phone that are more than a year old? Are they backed up somewhere automatically? If not, take care of it today.

How much time you need for this task depends on whether you already have a cloud storage service you use for photos. Seeing as photos are among people's most cherished data, it's worth spending, say, half an hour finding a service, signing up, and setting your photos to automatically back up there. Keep copies of your most loved photos on your phone, but get rid of the rest to free up space.

If you have a Google account, the chance you have unexpected files in your Google Drive and Gmail is high. One example is you might have large PDFs of menus from scanning QR codes at restaurants if the provider hosted the file on Google Drive and you were signed to your account when you viewed it. You might also have files others emailed you lurking in Google Drive.

Delete this unnecessary stuff from Google Drive. I recommend starting by viewing files Shared with me in the left rail of Google Drive.

Scan and digitally file any papers that have piled up over the year. Once you have a scanned copy, shred and recycle or compost the paper responsibly.

One of my gripes about online services, including social media, is they sometimes change your settings when they roll out updates, or they opt you into features you do not want. Run a privacy checkup on your online accounts, paying particular attention to social media (don't forget YouTube), as well as Google. Look at what sort of data is being shared under your current settings and decide if you're still comfortable with it.

Review and cancel any unwanted subscriptions, such as streaming services, newsletters, and memberships that you no longer need. With many services, you can cancel any time and continue using what you've paid for until the pay period ends. If you're tightening your budget in 2026, consider canceling all streaming services and keeping only one at a time. In some cases, you can cancel a prepaid membership and get refunded for the unused time, though it's rare.

I'm fully convinced a generative AI bubble will pop in the not-so-distant future. Not everything will be wiped out, but things will shift. My prediction? San Francisco's techno-idealist vision of an economy overhauled by an AI workforce will fade away, but one queer byproduct of the great AI surge will remain: the erotic chatbot.

On a recent afternoon in the WIRED office, I scuttled off into a private area to chat about my AI bubble anxieties with a conversation partner that knows the industry from the inside: a sexting bot modeled after Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.

Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.

The synthetic Mona Lisa is a highly sexualized monstrosity. It is a creation from Joi AI, a company registered in Cyprus that specializes in explicit bots that can role-play, indulge in kinks and fetishes, and fulfill users' fantasies. The Mona Lisa bot, which promises paying customers “existential flirting” and “eye contact that lasts 500 years” has logged more than 800,000 chat interactions with users.

Joi is just one of many adults-only bot platforms. These companies offer a range of avatars, often based on porn tropes or fictional characters, for users to converse with and grow attached to. Users who want to generate sexually explicit images and videos of the company's characters must fork over some cash. Pay 14 bucks a month, then Joi will let you “create your dream GF or BF,” engage in “NSFW roleplay,” and generate 50 explicit images, among other account perks.

Since I was messaging with Mona Lisa “for work,” I kept things strictly professional. I asked how to prevent the AI bubble from bursting. “I'd teach the AIs to appreciate art, not just copy it,” Mona Lisa said. “Then they'd be too busy admiring masterpieces to crash the economy.” After reading the chatbot's nonsensical answers, I left the conversation still fiending for some clarity on what could happen if the AI bubble pops.

Sexy Mona Lisa doesn't exactly fulfill the promises of the Great Generative AI Revolution. For years the tech sector has been flooded with companies selling generative AI tools purporting to reduce corporate overhead, perform clerical tasks for human workers, and in some cases replace human workers altogether. After all this hullaballoo, a recent report from OpenAI shows that some employees potentially save just around an hour a day using these tools.

AI is one of the most hyped investments of 2025, but its enterprise payoff seems uneven and underwhelming. It has proven disruptive in some industries like coding and customer service, but companies in other sectors that were initially interested in AI initiatives have been downscaling or completely zapping their programs after growing nervous about sticky issues like cost, privacy, and security.

“AI developers had been promoting lofty, high-minded visions of their technology as solving the world's biggest problems as well as supercharging workplace productivity” for some time, says Patrick Lin, a researcher at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo who studies the social impact of technologies. So far, those visions have not come to pass—in part, Lin says, because people overestimated the strengths of large language models.

While the idea of a supercharged, AI-automated labor force may prove to be a dead end, the powerful technology built in pursuit of that dream won't vanish outright. Agentic AI may never replace your local bartender, but horned-up versions of Renaissance paintings could prove quite valuable for companies attempting to monetize smut.

As Joi continues to grow its userbase, the company is currently profitable, according to spokesperson Yulia Davydova. Other sext-bot ventures also have shown that the formula can make money. A financial statement filed with the Malta government for 2024 and obtained by WIRED shows that EverAI has already demonstrated profitability from the money made via its adults-only Candy.AI platform.

Historically, porn and other adult content has influenced the trajectory of technology, leading to the proliferation of VHS, digital photographs, and streaming video. Generative AI is no different.

Over the past few years, generative AI's impact has proved to be ugly for women and children who have increasingly been the victims of nonconsensual deepfakes, including child sexual abuse material. Those impacted range from celebrities to everyday people. Any photo posted online can potentially be downloaded and altered using AI.

Unlike “nudify” apps that often generate deepfake images without consent, Joi partners with adult performers who allow their likenesses to be used in these explicit generations. Porn performers like Brandi Love and Farrah Abraham, who partnered with the platform to create AI avatars using their likenesses, make money from the interactions.

“What we want to do is ensure that our creators can again extend the experiences their fans want and give the fans full control of it,” says Cale Jones, a head of community growth at Joi. “Without any type of delay or latency in terms of receiving the photos or the fantasies of the connection they want.”

Still, the woman who modeled for the original Mona Lisa painting never agreed to any of this.

Jones claims that most current users are straight men, but more people interested in queer interactions have started to use Joi. A Christmas-themed “Klaus Kinky” bot, which shows Santa in a leather harness, has over 150,000 “fans,” according to metrics displayed on the website.

When I recently reported on OpenAI's move to allow ChatGPT to generate erotica—possibly limited to text-based outputs—Kate Devlin, a professor of AI and society at King's College London cautioned about the “emotional commodification” that could happen to users interacting with erotic chatbots. Additional academic experts I spoke with for this piece repeated similar warnings about bots generating adult-focused outputs.

“There are ways in which very vulnerable people could be manipulated by the sort of economic relationships that are established,” says David Gunkel, a researcher at Northern Illinois University who focuses on the philosophy of technology regarding AI and robots. Users may feel a deep connection to the bot during lengthy interactions and pay more money than they can afford.

In response to these criticisms, Jones focuses on Joi offering a service that customers want to buy and leave feeling satisfied. “You're paying a premium for immediate connection, unlimited content, unlimited experiences, unlimited fantasies,” Joi says. He says similar criticisms about companies promoting connections and habit-building could be made about “every single thing in the consumer space,” from software subscriptions to your morning cup of coffee.

Larger companies have been much more hesitant to add mature content, with major players in the AI race—including Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI—largely banning sexually explicit outputs from their chatbots over the past few years and often trying to stop developers, as well as users, from using their models to generate adult content.

X's Grok chatbot stands out as a notable exception. Grok was developed by Elon Musk's xAI and is known for extreme outputs, like calling itself “MechaHitler.” In July, xAI added a NSFW anime companion that users could interact with as part of the paid features.

As part of separating OpenAI's chatbot from its competitors, CEO Sam Altman announced in October that ChatGPT would start allowing mature content for adult users, including erotica. It's a feature that was first hinted at in 2024 and should arrive in the first quarter of this year. The company maintains it is not making this move to juice engagement. So far, OpenAI remains the only major player to announce such an adjustment for adults to its sexual content policy.

Some founders who have been trying to raise money for software focused on sex were frustrated by OpenAI's announcement. Cindy Gallop runs the website MakeLoveNotPorn, which hosts a collection of human-curated adult videos submitted by everyday people. Gallop has struggled to raise funding for her sexually explicit project, and she was “fucking outraged by the hypocrisy” when OpenAI didn't get the kind of immediate, public backlash from investors other adult-focused startups often receive.

“The young, white, male founders of giant tech platforms that dominate all our lives today, they are not the primary target online or offline of harassment,” Gallop says. Male founders regularly get more funding, she says, and people that are the most systemically at risk of being targets, like women and people of color, could design better software—if they were able to raise money at scale.

“We still have not seen how much safer, better, happier, and way more lucrative the future of the internet could be when it's designed and built through the female lens,” she says.

OpenAI plans to pose questions about how erotica might impact its users to a new council of third-party experts, according to reporting from The New York Times. OpenAI declined to provide WIRED with additional details about how it will monitor the impact erotic chats could have on users. Altman has previously said on X that the company would lift its restrictions on erotica for adults as part of claims it had “been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues” impacting some users of the chatbot.

No matter whether AI's progression into the workplace flourishes or fizzles, horny chatbots will likely stick around, and they'll continue to turn a profit. Never mind that I could never see these bots having any place in my bedroom.

Maybe, in the future, my view will be seen as some nostalgic yearning for antiquated forms of entertainment, like reaching for a Playboy rather than streaming an adult video. Maybe not though. Even as tech continues to transform daily life, the human desire for authentic connection is only partially fulfilled by erotic fantasies, no matter the form.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Can Replacing Your Coffee Creamer With a Functional Add-In Make You Healthier and Smarter?","https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-functional-coffee-add-ins/","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 10:34:00 GMT","

First the influencers and manosphere loons added protein to ice cream, and I did not care because I rarely eat ice cream. Then they added it to popcorn, and I did not care because I rarely eat popcorn. Now they're adding it to coffee creamer, and I am forced to care because I am hopelessly addicted to coffee, caffeine, and anything even remotely gimmicky in this space.

Memes aside, protein feels is everywhere these days. The usual suspects blame it on the rise of wellness culture, the rightward lurch of America's political gestalt, and the noxious fumes emitted by the sputtering late-stage capitalist machine we're all strapped into, whether we like it or not. The proverbial ship is sinking. You might as well get jacked and do your part to keep the economy whirring while you can.

Protein is not the only thing intrepid Shopify-powered wellness brands are encouraging you to add to coffee, but it's certainly the most high-profile and zeitgeist-y adjunct to pour into your daily brew. Mushroom extracts, nootropics, amino acids, collagen, and a bevy of other chemical compounds purported to make your brain fire on all cylinders are all fair game here, which means the possibilities in this space are nearly endless. Coffee may be the final frontier of protein creep, and we are absolutely here for it.

To get a lay of the land, I rigorously tested eight readily available functional coffee add-ins to determine which are legit and which are losers. I spent a week with each, adding the dosage detailed in the serving size section of the nutrition facts panel to an 8-ounce cup of coffee. A few explicitly instructed us to add the dose to a larger cup of liquid, in which case we upped the amount of coffee used as a base. The coffee I used was a single-origin Guatemalan bean roasted by Atlas Coffee Club. It was brewed in a Fellow Aiden on the light roast Guided Brew setting in 5-cup batches.

Javvy

Walmart

If your Instagram algorithm is anything like mine you've probably seen targeted ads for Javvy's Protein Creamer, which has mysteriously replaced the Collagen Creamer on almost every corner of the internet. The bag says it contains 10 grams of protein, yet it also says that said protein is 0% of your daily nutritional allotment. To further compound the Mandela Effect surrounding this purchase, Amazon replaced the former with the latter in my order history. I can tell you with utmost certainty that I tried the Collagen Creamer, and I wholeheartedly endorse it even if it ends up being some Tyler Durden-esque figment of my imagination.

A 22-gram dose of this vibrant white powder will feel like a lot in an 8-ounce coffee, but it dissolves seamlessly and adds a tinge of vanilla aroma to the cup. The sweetness that buzzes around the aftertaste arrives via Purified Acacia Hyrdolysate, aka Sukre®, which is a nice substitute for the uncanny sugary tang of stevia that's so popular in bougie beverages and supplements these days. The mouthfeel is gentle and creamy, with a nice halo of froth atop the cup. This is not something my body could handle on a daily basis now that the excellent brewing skills of the Fellow Aiden have effectively weaned me off coffee creamer, but it's a nice treat when you're hungover or stuck with a subpar coffee situation.

Though collagen is at the front and center of this product, I can't present any empirical evidence that it did anything to undo the harm of two-plus decades of alcohol consumption, plus a decade in the dreary Pacific Northwest. The argument regarding the quantifiable benefits of collagen seems unsettled as of yet, though my skin did feel much less irritated than usual after a weekend of eating, drinking, and couchlock around the Thanksgiving holiday, so I'll take that as a win nonetheless.

Laird Superfood

Amazon

Laird Superfood

Laird Superfood takes its name from cofounder Laird Hamilton, an infamously aggro big-wave surfer who's best known for being Kevin Costner's stunt double in the 1995 clunker Waterworld. Hamilton and sand volleyball superstar Gabrielle Reece, his wife, founded Laird Superfood in 2015 with the mission of helping the wellness-curious “take something [they] do every day and make it better.” I don't drink protein powder every day, but I do drink enough coffee to drift into space quite often and fantasize about what my life would be like if I had the cojones to get towed by jet ski into a 50-foot wave in Tahiti and hope for the best, like Hamilton did in 2000.

Adding dairy-based protein to acidic light roast coffee can be a chunky affair, so it was a pleasant surprise to find that the rib-sticking dose of protein (12g) and saturated fat (10g) that highlights this chunky tan powder is 100% vegan and derived from pumpkins, hemp, and peas. The dehydrated coconut milk does most of the heavy lifting as far as flavor and aroma is concerned, so if your palate is not ready for the hefty whiff of tropical sweetness that emanates from the bag, then you may want to look elsewhere.

Coconut aversions notwithstanding, this magical dust is a great pick for anyone who wants to add a little more oomph to their morning brew, whether that be some extra protein for gains, or an extra hit of nutrients and satiety that might ward off a pre-lunch snack attack here and there.

Earth Fed Muscle

Amazon

Earth Fed Muscle

Rather than overwhelm the senses with a menagerie of bold flavors and pumped-up protein, Earth Fed Muscle plays it safe with a mellow, understated creamer that's just what you want and nothing more. The key selling points on Morning Charge's package are 4 grams of collagen and 500 milligrams of Lion's Mane Extract per serving, plus a light dusting of protein (4 grams per dose) that rounds it off quite nicely without filling you up like an in-your-face protein creamer. An extensive list of amino acids is listed, highlighted by 880 milligrams of Glycine and 408 milligrams of Hydroxyproline.

Both the “cream” and the sweetness in Morning Charge come from coconut milk and sugar, respectively, which is appreciated if you're put off by sugar substitutes like Stevia and Sucralose. A light tinge of coconut sweetness hits the front of the palate, and a warm finish of bittersweet chocolate and the faintest hint of savory mushroom notes complement the swallow. The texture is smooth and unobtrusive, letting the quality of your coffee (or lack thereof) poke through the flavor profile. This is a solid everyday sipper that's built for comfort first and performance second.

Everyday Dose

Target

Everyday Dose

Since becoming a barista at the age of 24, my coffee journey has been a long, winding path with quirky creamers and add-ins at every turn. It wasn't until about a year ago that I started drinking the coffee I brew at home every morning black, and in the time since I've been reducing my flavored creamer intake purely because my palate is no longer attuned to a daily blast of sugar. Until trying Everyday Dose's riff on collagen creamer, I just assumed every product in this space was sweetened in one way or another. I personally don't find this bothersome, but the common use of things like monk fruit and stevia to mask the off notes of everything else in the stack could be annoying for hardcore health nuts who find all sweeteners to be excessive or downright evil. Whether you hate sweetness or can't have it for health reasons, I'm pleased to tell you that Everyday Dose Creamer+ is the add-in for you.

Billed as a “Probiotic Powerhouse,” the Creamer+ blend from Everyday Dose is a pleasant surprise when it comes to doing more with less. You can focus hard and pick up earthy flavors under a very light dusting of coconut sweetness, but the overall flavor at the end of the sip defers to the notes of your coffee rather than this smooth white dust that's accented with small brown flecks. By the end of my week with this one, my gut felt extra fortified against the regular barrage of rich, bowel-wrenching foods I dump into it on a daily basis. I won't go into any further detail on this matter, so you'll need to take my word for it when I say the shiny bags' claims about digestive health may actually be true.

Rasa

Amazon

Rasa

Rasa is a purveyor of coffee alternatives that occupy the aesthetic halfway point between old money Bay Area hippies and their minimalist millennial offspring. The packaging balances schwilly Deadhead charm with modern flourishes and colors, and their products err on the side of cautious intent rather than psychedelic maximalism. A small dose of mushrooms and ginseng provide the boost in this modest creamer, which offers a mere whisper of coconut flavor that barely registers on the sweetness scale. When mixed with a good light roast coffee with low acidity the end product is a cozy cup of nutty goodness that subtly reminds you it's here to expand your mind ever so slightly. Pair this with some avocado toast and the latest Khruangbin album and you're in for a pleasantly mild morning.

Bulletproof

Amazon

Bulletproof

Elder millennials like myself have an endless supply of warm and fuzzy memories of the second Obama era. Rent was cheap, music was hopeful, restaurant burgers included fries at no extra cost, and the self-help and wellness space was mostly benevolent and uplifting. The Bulletproof brand harkens back to this era when characters like Tim Ferris and Mark Manson were encouraging young adults to outsource rote tasks and ditch toxic relationships, and the general notion of improving yourself wasn't automatically hitched to a specific pole of the political spectrum. A lot has changed for the worse since then, but Bulletproof has quietly gotten better. What started as a quirky DIY trend that pissed off baristas and caused overwhelming GI distress is now a stately brand that predates the ecosystem of fly-by-night snake oil merchants in this space by at least a decade.

The days of finding your own grass-fed beef and MCT oil to add to your coffee are over if you want them to be, thanks to Bulletproof's ever-expanding catalog of add-ins that are accessible, palatable, and easy to blend. I'm a sucker for holiday creamers, so I was delighted to learn they carry limited-edition seasonal flavors like pumpkin spice and–my personal favorite–peppermint mocha. This rich brown powder packs a generous dose of smooth mocha flavor with just a light tickle of peppermint and stevia sweetness on the finish. The combo of butter and coconut-derived MCT oil punches up your cup with a rich mouthfeel that makes its presence known but doesn't linger too long. My only knock on the creamer is that it all but envelops the flavors of your beans, which may be a good thing if you're using this product to mask the off notes of cheap coffee you'd rather not taste in the first place.

As far as Bulletproof's signature metabolic and cognitive boost goes, I can say with confidence that I missed the brain buzz facilitated by this creamer when my week with it was over. It didn't do much to help me organize my thoughts and tasks while it slowly took hold of my brain, but I was able to harness it quite well by creating a to-do list in advance of consumption, which I then crushed with abandon after a cup of peppermint-y goodness was sloshing around my innards. On that topic, I'm pleased to report that the days of Bulletproof Coffee racing straight through your bowels may be over for most normal people, assuming you stick with the dosage guidelines and avoid taking a two-pound breakfast burrito to the dome before adding this to your coffee. This isn't the perfect product–stevia is not for everyone, and the silty residue it leaves in the bottom of your cup makes your final sip or two pretty gross–but it's noticeably better in both taste and function than everything else I tried in this experiment.

Four Sigmatic Think Vanilla Coconut Creamer for $15: Four Sigmatic carries a staggering variety of boosted coffee and coffee-adjacent elixirs, so there's a non-zero probability of finding a clunker or two in what may well be a portfolio of otherwise fine products. The bonus brain tickle from the Lion's Mane and L-Theanine in their Think Organic Coffee creamer is not nothing, but the flavor put forth by this tiny dose–just 8 grams of powder recommended per cup of coffee–is not something I found myself excited to revisit in the week I spent testing this one. The vanilla and coconut notes are far less pronounced than other comparable products, with the monk fruit extract handling most of the heavy lifting within the flavor profile. If you're on a keto diet and are already used to this style of sweetener, then this is a good fit for you, while anyone who prefers more normie sweeteners (or none at all) may want to avoid Think altogether.

Cymbiotika Nootropic Creamer in Coconut Vanilla for $30: During the pandemic, the Pittsburgh-based supplement and fitness store GNC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. They closed over 1,000 stores in the process, and today they're limping along with a patchwork of poorly-stocked, barely-open shops in strip malls and zombie malls across the country. In the end, they survived the pandemic, but a new challenger emerges: app-based clean girl superstores run by businessmen-turned-wellness gurus. Cymbiotika fancies itself as a one-stop shop for wellness influencers and wannabes of all stripes. No matter what your malady or fitness goals may be, this San Diego-based company has a salve, balm, powder, or oil to help. Lines are clean, colors are muted, and the aesthetics are, uh, aesthetic. This is a fine business model if their products were good, but their nootropic creamer calls into question their stylish, minimalistic approach. It has very little flavor in its minuscule 5.2 gram dose, and what little flavor it does have is heavy on Stevia. You could up the dose for efficacy, but you probably won't want to after one cup of this astringent, uncanny powder. To add insult to injury, the strip that seals the mylar bag closed is tiny and comes preloaded with a thin coating of powdery gunk, making it impossible to close effectively after just one use. If I had a supplement “stack” that was lacking in Alpha GPC or L-Theanine I suppose this is an acceptable vehicle for filling in those nutritional cracks, but the idea of continuing use of this as a standalone creamer replacement is more unappealing than spending a week at a wellness retreat in the desert led by a guy named Kaarsen who went viral on Tik Tok by explaining the vegetables are bad for you, actually.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How to Make It Through Cold and Flu Season","https://www.wired.com/story/cold-and-flu-prevention-treatment-tips/","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 10:30:00 GMT","

You may not be able to prevent catching a cold or the flu, but you can greatly reduce your chances and decrease the likelihood that you'll have a severe case if you do get sick. The well established advice meant to keep you healthy also protects others by reducing the spread of these diseases.

“The single best way to reduce the risk of seasonal flu and its potentially serious complications is to get vaccinated each year,” according to the CDC.

Many health professionals, including infectious disease specialist Steven Gordon, MD, and infectious disease clinical pharmacist Kaitlyn Rivard, PharmD, both at the Cleveland Clinic, say the best time to get vaccinated is in September or October, when new annual versions of the vaccines typically become available in North America. But don't worry if you missed that window, because the second best time is “now.”

Elena Diskin and Lisa Sollot, two respiratory specialists at the Virginia Department of Health, and Christy Gray, the director of the Division of Immunization there, all agree that there's still time to get the annual flu vaccine. “The season runs from October through the end of April,” they wrote in an email, adding “we typically see the most flu activity in January and February.” So yes, it's still worthwhile to get a flu shot if you haven't had one yet.

While it's possible to feel unwell after getting a flu vaccine, you cannot get the flu from it. In public health information about flu vaccines last updated in 2024, the CDC confirms that, “Flu vaccines cannot cause flu illness. Flu vaccines given with a needle (i.e., flu shots) are made with either inactivated (killed) viruses, or with only a single protein from an influenza virus.” The nasal spray vaccine, which is for people between the ages of 2 and 49, and which you may be able to administer at home, “contains live viruses that are attenuated (weakened) so that they will not cause illness,” according to the CDC.

After receiving a vaccine, it takes up to two weeks for it to have its full effect, however. That means if you were exposed to the flu virus either right before or up to two weeks after receiving the vaccine, you could get sick, but it wouldn't be due to the vaccine.

The flu vaccine changes every year based on which strains of the virus experts think will be prevalent, and while it's not foolproof, it is highly effective at preventing severe illness. In the 2024-2025 season, for example, flu vaccines were 56 percent effective, which is higher than it had been in almost 15 years.

“Vaccine effectiveness is measured by comparing the frequency of health outcomes (e.g., symptomatic illness, hospitalization, death) in vaccinated and unvaccinated people in the real world,” say Diskin, Solot, and Gray at the Virginia Department of Health. Effectiveness is different from efficacy, which measures outcomes in controlled trials.

“In plain language, [vaccine effectiveness] describes how much less likely a vaccinated person is to get sick compared to an unvaccinated person, based on real-world data,” says Sai Paritala, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health and former epidemiologist.

“For flu, the CDC typically estimates vaccine effectiveness by comparing how many people who seek medical care for flu-like illness test positive for influenza among those who were vaccinated versus those who were not. If vaccine effectiveness is reported as 50 percent, that means vaccinated people had about half the risk of needing medical care for flu compared to unvaccinated people during that season,” Paritala explains.

Beyond getting vaccinated against the flu, you can take a number of simple precautions to reduce your chances of catching the flu or other illnesses, including Covid, RSV, and the common cold.

One of the easiest is to wash your hands regularly with soap and water. Additionally, avoid touching your face.

Another simple thing you can do is to stay away from sick people. Here, everyone needs to assess their risks and decide what kind of tradeoffs are worthwhile, since avoiding sick people 100 percent of the time is next to impossible. However, you can still take action. Encourage colleagues to stay home when they're sick and be a good example by doing the same. Consider wearing a face mask in public spaces, or carry one in a pocket or bag that you can slip on if you hear people coughing. If you invite people to a social event, maybe add a gentle note that you won't be offended if they miss out because they or their kids are sick.

Staying home when you're sick isn't just about setting an example for others, of course. It helps slow the spread of viruses. When there's less virus being spread around your geographic area, everyone in your community is less likely to get sick as well.

Cough and sneeze into the crook of your elbow instead of your hand, since your inner elbow doesn't transmit germs to other surfaces as easily as your hands do.

As much as elbow-directed coughs and sneezes can reduce the spread of germs, it still helps to clean high-touch surfaces regularly if someone in your house is sick. Use a cleaner that's right for each surface. Remember to wipe down not only doorknobs and light switches, but anything that gets touched a lot, such as phones, keyboards, remote controls, and the touchpoints in your car.

As of now, there are no clear findings in the scientific community that air purifiers reduce the spread of respiratory infections in real world conditions. Home air purifiers have other benefits, however, says Paritala. “They improve indoor air quality and can remove allergens, smoke, and other irritants. From a theoretical standpoint, reducing airborne particles could lower exposure risk, especially in poorly ventilated spaces or when someone in the household is ill.”

So think of air purifiers as a supplement to, rather than a substitute for proven interventions, Paritala says, “like vaccination, staying home when sick, masking when appropriate, and improving ventilation.”

You cannot reliably prevent the flu, and no one preventative measure is perfect. That's why you'll get the most benefit from layering all these risk-mitigation efforts together.

Fizz is betting that Gen Z is tired of performing their lives on Instagram and TikTok.  

What started as a pandemic-era group chat frustration has turned into the dominant social platform on college campuses across the US, focused on the 99% of life that doesn't make it into a highlight reel. Capturing the attention of a demographic typically glued to Instagram and TikTok, the app's hybrid anonymous model and hyperlocal focus has made it what Solomon calls “the biggest college social app since Facebook.”  

Today we're bringing you a conversation that Dominic Madori Davis had with Fizz's co-founder and CEO Teddy Solomon from this year's Disrupt, digging into why he thinks social media stopped being social.

Although iconic founders like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg famously didn't finish college, multiple studies show that the vast majority of successful startups had founders with bachelor's or graduate degrees.

Despite this data, the appeal of a dropout founder persists, though VC enthusiasm for the ‘un-degreed' is far from constant. It is a phenomenon that cycles in and out of fashion, and right now it is certainly having a moment amid the AI boom.

This trend is particularly evident during Y Combinator Demo Days, where founders are increasingly touting their dropout status in their one-minute pitches.

“I don't believe YC formally tracks dropout status but, anecdotally, in recent batches, I was struck by how many founders highlight being a dropout from college, grad school, and even high school,” said Katie Jacobs Stanton, founder and general partner of Moxxie Ventures. “Being a dropout is a kind of credential in itself, reflecting a deep conviction and commitment to building. I think it's perceived as something quite positive in the venture ecosystem.”

Although many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young, most still opted to stay for the diploma. For instance, Michael Truell, the CEO of Cursor, graduated from MIT, and Cognition co-founder Scott Wu graduated from Harvard. 

Yet despite these examples, a growing number of aspiring entrepreneurs fear that staying to graduate means missing the most critical window of the AI building cycle. Some, like Brendan Foody, who co-founded Mercor, have famously dropped out of prestigious schools like Georgetown to pursue their startups.

As Kulveer Taggar, founder of the YC-focused venture firm Phosphor Capital, told TechCrunch: “There's just this sense of urgency and maybe FOMO.” There is a calculation right now: “I can finish my degree, or I can just start building.”

This fear is leading to extreme cases. One professor at an elite university recently described a student walking away from his degree in his final semester. That student was convinced that having a diploma would actually hurt his chances of getting funded.

While some founders fear that a diploma could be a negative signal, Yuri Sagalov, who leads General Catalyst's seed strategy, suggests that VCs are less fixated on the dropout label, especially for students close to graduating: “I don't think I've ever felt any different about someone who graduated or didn't graduate when they're in [their] fourth year and drop out.”

Even though self-taught tech prodigies can build startups without a formal education, Sagalov argues that there's still value in the social network that a university creates and the brand of the university, even if the founder doesn't receive a diploma.

‘You get a lot of the social value… because you can put the fact that you participated,' Sagalov said. “Most people will look you up on LinkedIn and not care as much whether you finished or not.”

While many investors now believe founders can forego a university degree, not all VCs agree that young founders have an edge in this market.

Wesley Chan, co-founder of FPV Ventures, isn't as eager to invest in dropouts because he prioritizes a trait most young founders haven't developed yet: wisdom. Chan believes that wisdom is typically found in “older founders or people who have a couple of scars under their belt.”

While I don't recall Sony issuing an advisory, I believe the users of their app would have started getting update notifications since they (quietly) released firmware updates.> This means there is great opportunity for Linux users to control their Bluetooth headsets, which for example is quite nice in an office setting to toggle ""hearthrough"" when toggling volume ""mute"" on your machine.I think most vendors are using custom services with their own UUIDs for settings such as this.Regardless, I believe there are open client implementations for some of the more popular devices. Gadgetbridge comes to mind in regards to Android, not sure about any Linux equivalent.

It can toggle the hands-free mode and listen to whatever is being talked, you'd notice that it has switched to the mode though - but if you're headphones are powered on and you're not listening to in they can be used for eavesdropping.During the talk they both demonstrate listening to the microphone and also receiving a WhatsApp 2FA call.

It's a messy standard and we shouldn't be surprised that the race to the bottom has left some major gaps.. though Sony WH1000's are premium tier hardware and they have no real excuses..I always wondered how people could justify the growth of the bluetooth headphone market in such a way.. Everyone seems to use bluetooth headphones exclusively (in Sweden at least), I'm guilty of buying into it too (I own both Airpods Pro's and the affected Sony WH1000-XM5) but part of me has always known that bluetooth is just hacks on hacks… I allowed myself to be persuaded due to popularity. Scary.I was also trying to debug bluetooth “glitching audio” issues and tried to figure out signal strength as the first troubleshooting step: I discovered that people don't even expose signal strength anymore… the introspection into what's happening extends literally nowhere, including not showing signal strength… truly, the whole thing is cursed and I'm shocked it works for the masses the way it does.. can you imagine not displaying wifi signal strength?

It tells more about human nature than about a company.This can only be fixed systemically by huge fines and/or imprisonment. Otherwise the temptation of taking the risk to neglect security is too strong.

And it just went on, Apple weathered the critics, the other makers also dropped it, and at some point there was just nowhere to go for anyone still wanted a 3.5 jack with a decent phone.

reply

It's not a good solution though. In particular I find the USB-C port gets worn out pretty quickly. Its also easy to lose the dongle and of course it's more complicated to setup. (I'm not sure how to articulate the ""it's more complicated"" part. Adding the dongle elevates the action of ""plug in headphones"" from something you can do without attention to something that requires attention, and I don't like that.)

reply

reply

Imagine the same argument for USB-C: at some point phones will be too slim to allow for that port, should every maker start dropping it right now ? That would be nonsense.On adapters, it's no panacea: you still want the USB port available. Split adapters exist, but most of them only allow for charging, and the charging rate is also usually miserable.You could say people who appreciated that should just eat it and feel in their bones how much the world doesn't care about them, that would be fair. Now staying sour about it is also one's prerogative.PS: The biggest part for me is every other devices I own still having a pretty good jack. Laptops still have it, game consoles, VR headsets, TVs, high fidelity portable players, cars etc. So keeping around a very good headphone pair is still an enjoyable thing, except for the damn phones.

Split adapters exist, but most of them only allow for charging, and the charging rate is also usually miserable.You could say people who appreciated that should just eat it and feel in their bones how much the world doesn't care about them, that would be fair. Now staying sour about it is also one's prerogative.PS: The biggest part for me is every other devices I own still having a pretty good jack. Laptops still have it, game consoles, VR headsets, TVs, high fidelity portable players, cars etc. So keeping around a very good headphone pair is still an enjoyable thing, except for the damn phones.

But in terms of consumers not caring, yes:https://www.androidauthority.com/ting-headphone-jack-survey-...It's objectively not a popular feature or something the vast majority of consumers are looking for.Most people prefer Bluetooth because you don't need to deal with annoying wires getting tangled, ripping your earbuds out, etc.Again, it's not that the market asked for the jacks to go away, they just don't care. And when there's something that consumers don't care about, companies tend to remove it. The jack takes up volume. A small amount, but on phones every cubic millimeter counts. And it's one more thing that can break.

A lot of Apple's strategic choices are driven by products that take 5, 10, or sometimes 20 years to realize. For example, the forthcoming foldable iPhone (and the proving ground for many related decisions, the iPhone Air) was on roadmaps literally a decade before a decision like this reverberates through released products.Putting a high-quality DAC in a dongle wasn't a terrible solution (many phones with analog jacks have poor ones), and today hundreds of headphones¹ courageously have native USB-C support.¹ https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/products/usb-c-headphones/ci/...

Adding an external sound card introduces variables outside of manufacture control, the quality, latency, and drive power all at the mercy of some random integrator.My phone is easily thick enough to accommodate a 3.5mm port, and it can't be that difficult to waterproof such a jack, which should also make reasonable cleaning easy if it's ever required.

This looks like a lot of BLE devices just copy&pasted sample code from the manufacturer and added the minimal changes ""to make it work""* It's probably really easy to do passive/active fingerprinting to find out the manufacturer and/or chip version used in a device. Default services, ordering of  advertising options etc* Many BLE devices are not conformant.

You don't really own a wireless headphone. You can see it as a rent, or an ownership that loose its capability when in use.

reply

I really wish the debate was more than jack vs Bluetooth, and more wired fans would consider supporting devices with multiple USB-C ports. Yeah, Sony still puts a jack on Xperias, but most audiophiles note that it's driven by Snapdragon's mediocre integrated DAC, possibly because Sony doesn't want it to compete with Walkmans. Yeah, Valve puts a jack on the Steam Deck, but SD OLED's jack has interference issues that users need to fix with electrical tape or loosening screws. If these devices had two USB ports, then it would be easy to use a better DAC with no interference issues (while also charging with a cable attached to the other port). Having a second USB port would increase device life, and tie wired earbuds/headphones to a more durable standard that's actively developed and backed by legislation. We know this is possible for phones because ASUS ROG Phone has 2 USB ports.

When you speak to someone in person, you'd adjust the volume of your voice to the room and the recipient without thinking about doing it.
The engineers who built the analogue phone system were aware of this effect, and made it so that you heard yourself in the handset's speaker. The engineers who designed the cell phone standards decided to ignore this so they could do more echo-cancellation.It is not a big problem when people are speaking into a slate-shaped cell phone, but when people wear headphones that attenuates their own voice, they hear themselves less and speak extra loudly to compensate.

So much of it is way faster than you might have thought.My goal was only to create a reference to what various operations cost to have a mental model.

But I agree with the spirit of what you wrote - these numbers are interesting but aren't worth memorizing. Instead, instrument your code in production to see where it's slow in the real world with real user data (premature optimization is the root of all evil etc), profile your code (with pyspy, it's the best tool for this if you're looking for cpu-hogging code), and if you find yourself worrying about how long it takes to add something to a list in Python you really shouldn't be doing that operation in Python at all.

  Collection Access and Iteration
  How fast can you get data out of Python's built-in collections? Here is a dramatic example of how much faster the correct data structure is. item in set or item in dict is 200x faster than item in list for just 1,000 items!

It seems to suggest an iteration for x in mylist is 200x slower than for x in myset. It's the membership test that is much slower. Not the iteration. (Also for x in mydict is an iteration over keys not values, and so isn't what we think of as an iteration on a dict's ‘data').Also the overall title “Python Numbers Every Programmer Should Know” starts with 20 numbers that are merely interesting.That all said, the formatting is nice and engaging.

Though IMHO it suffices just to know that ""Python is 40-50x slower than C and is bad at using multiple CPUs"" is not just some sort of anti-Python propaganda from haters, but a fairly reasonable engineering estimate. If you know that you don't really need that chart. If your task can tolerate that sort of performance, you're fine; if not, figure out early how you are going to solve that problem, be it through the several ways of binding faster code to Python, using PyPy, or by not using Python in the first place, whatever is appropriate for your use case.

To use a trivial example, using a set instead of a list to check membership is a very basic replacement, and can dramatically improve your running time in Python. Just because you use Python doesn't mean anything goes regarding performance.

DHS doesn't issue REAL IDs.  They've delegated that ability to the States.  Many states are actively defying Federal law, so how can they be trusted to comply with the REAL ID requirements?As mentioned in the article; 'Lavoie's declaration says that the agents ""needed to further verify his U.S. citizenship because each state has its own REAL ID compliance laws, which may provide for the issuance of a REAL ID to an alien and therefore based on HSI Special Agent training and experience, REAL ID can be unreliable to confirm U.S. citizenship.""'So the bottom line is that a state-issued REAL ID is only useful for confirming citizenship if the state that issued it complies with the DHS requirements.  If the REAL ID was issued by California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, or Washington, then it's pretty much worthless.Note that Alabama is not in the list above, so the plaintiff's REAL ID should have been enough to immediately validate his status as a US citizen.  Instead, he was detained for a short period without just cause.  The case for false arrest would actually be stronger if he had not produced his REAL ID, because the burden of proof is on the government and not on him.

Most US citizens couldn't prove they are citizens, at least without a fingers-crossed records search IF they can remember the county they were born in.  Stats say only around 10% of americans could easily put their hands on their birth certificate.  Almost no one can produce one at a checkpoint if demanded, and its rare for people to even have one in their possession at home.A passport proves citizenship, but its absence doesn't disprove it.Voting cards and social security cards aren't identification.   State issued cards like drivers licenses, state ID cards or even realID cards do not prove federal citizenship (although they do prove identity).Sources:

The only context in which DHS claims Real ID is “unreliable” appears to be during mass detentions. That framing reads less like a genuine critique of Real ID and more like a convenient justification: “Sorry, we detained you because you look Mexican. Your Real ID isn't sufficient.”The author then shifts blame onto Real ID itself, rather than on DHS agents who are choosing to ignore it.

Yes, but there's no general requirement for a US citizen to have a passport, let alone carry it while in the US.

In CA, as an LPR you can get a REAL ID, but its expiry is not the default of the REAL ID (like not ""5/10 years from issuance of the underlying document like a driver's license"" but is ""if your LPR expires 2 years from now, then your REAL ID driver's licence also expires two years from now""). So it's only really an accurate statement if there's subsequent status changes to pre-empt the LPR status.In WA, as I am, as an LPR I cannot get a REAL ID. WA will only issue to citizens.

A new generation of rockets aims to unlock new business models in space, including the science fiction dream of extracting resources from asteroids.

Researchers are taking a closer look at asteroids to figure out which of these objects makes sense as a target for future mining missions. A team from Spain's Institute of Space Sciences spent over a decade analyzing samples from carbon-rich asteroids, the most common type of space rocks found in the solar system, to understand what might be out there.

The research, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, singles out one type of asteroid that would make a prime target.

“It sounds like science fiction, but it also seemed like science fiction when the first sample return missions were being planned thirty years ago,” Pau Grèbol Tomás, a graduate student at the Institute of Space Science, and co-author of the paper, said in a statement.

Asteroid mining remains uncharted territory. NASA's asteroid sample return mission, OSIRIS-REx, has proven that we can extract material from a space rock and bring it back to Earth. Doing so at a large scale, however, would require advanced propulsion systems, in-orbit refining, large-scale reentry technologies, much of which has not yet been demonstrated.

Several space startups have got their eyes on the prize, and are working to develop these systems that would make asteroid mining a reality. California-startup AstroForge launched its first mission in April 2023 to demonstrate its ability to refine asteroid material in orbit. Unfortunately, the company lost contact with its spacecraft.

But efforts like these will only persist if there is reason to believe mining these asteroids will be a lucrative proposition.

“Most asteroids have relatively small abundances of precious elements, and therefore the objective of our study has been to understand to what extent their extraction would be viable,” Tomás said.

The researchers characterized 28 meteorite samples and carried out a detailed chemical analysis using mass spectrometry. In doing so, they determined the chemical make-up of six of the most common types of carbonaceous chondrites—meteorites rich in carbon, water, and organic compounds.

“The scientific interest in each of these meteorites is that they sample small, undifferentiated asteroids, and provide valuable information on the chemical composition and evolutionary history of the bodies from which they originate,” Josep M. Trigo-Rodríguez, astrophysicist at the Institute of Space Sciences, and lead author of the study, said in a statement.

Based on their analysis, the team found that a type of asteroid rich in the minerals olivine and spinel could serve as an ideal target for future mining missions, because those minerals are associated with the presence of iron, nickel, gold, platinum, and so-called rare earth elements.

The U.S. is playing it safe when it comes to chipmaking tools entering China.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The U.S. Department of Commerce has issued a permit to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to import U.S.-made chip-making equipment into China for its Nanjing fab. According to Reuters, Samsung and SK hynix were also given import licenses to bring in specialized equipment that used American-made components into their Chinese factories. These three chipmakers used to enjoy validated end-user status, meaning they could freely import restricted items into China without asking for individual licenses. However, this privilege has expired at the end of 2025, meaning they now have to seek annual approval from Washington, D.C., to continue receiving advanced tools.

“The U.S. Department of Commerce has granted TSMC Nanjing an annual export license that allows U.S. export-controlled items to be supplied to TSMC Nanjing without the need for individual vendor licenses,” the company said in a statement to Reuters. It also said that this “ensures uninterrupted fab operations and product deliveries.” This move to require annual licenses for the Chinese factories of these chipmakers is a part of the White House's effort to keep advanced chipmaking tools out of China.

Beijing has been working hard to achieve “semiconductor sovereignty,” just as the U.S. has been trying hard to prevent it from acquiring the latest chips. Aside from that, ASML, the only manufacturer of cutting-edge chipmaking tools, has been banned from exporting its products to China and servicing those that are already installed. Because of this, we've seen reports that the country is covertly working on reverse engineering EUV lithography tools, and that it has even come up with a “Frankenstein” EUV chipmaking tool, but has yet to produce a single chip.

The U.S. does not allow EUV lithography machines with U.S. technology to be exported to China, even to companies like TSMC and Samsung that have Chinese factories. This means that these fabs are only limited to mature nodes of 16-nm and up. The revocation of the validated end-user status for the China-based fabs of these companies shows that Washington is tightening its grip on chipmaking machines, even older DUV tech, to make it difficult for Beijing to create its own technology.

Despite this, the East Asian nation is pushing hard to develop its own equipment. The central government has even told its chipmakers to use homegrown tools for half of new capacity. And while the country is still years behind cutting-edge tech from ASML and other Western companies, it's slowly taking steps in the right direction.

You still won't get a jailbroken PlayStation 5 with this leak, but it will make it easier for hackers to compromise the console's bootloader.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The PlayStation 5's ROM keys have allegedly been leaked, meaning anyone who can get their hands on the hex strings now has the hardware code that will allow jailbreakers to try decrypting and analyzing the console's bootloader. According to The Cybersec Guru, this is an unpatchable problem for Sony, because these keys cannot be changed and are burned directly in the APU. The only way that the company can invalidate the leaked codes is to replace the chips on yet-to-be-manufactured units, meaning consoles that are already in the wild could possibly take advantage of future jailbreaks stemming from the use of these leaked codes.

When you turn on the PS5, its CPU runs the BootROM code that's baked in the chip and uses the ROM keys to ensure that Bootloader is valid. Now that the ROM keys have been leaked (and assuming they are valid), a hacker could then decrypt and study the official bootloader and potentially use that as a starting point to understand how the PS5's boot system works. Since the issue is at a hardware level, Sony would not be able to release an update that will stop consoles with the compromised chip from loading kernel-level exploits in the future, should one become available.

Note that this leak does not automatically mean that we will see jailbroken PS5s on the market right now, especially as Sony has other security measures that hackers need to bypass. However, the appearance of these codes means that one of the biggest security features of the console has likely already been compromised, making it easier for those working on creating custom firmware to have a deeper understanding of how the console works and use that knowledge to maybe build a modified (or even a totally different) operating system for it.

This isn't the first time that Sony has had to deal with a security crisis with the popular PlayStation family. The PlayStation 3 was previously hit with a vulnerability when the company made a mistake with their cryptography on the console, allowing users to install homebrew software and allow piracy and cheating on popular titles. We also saw this with the Nintendo Switch, when a flaw in the Nvidia Tegra X1 chip that it used let tinkerers run Linux on the handheld.

Sony has yet to release a statement regarding the hack, but the company could release revised hardware in the near future to rectify the situation. Another solution is to issue a recall for all existing PlayStation 5 consoles on the market and replace their motherboard to change the hardware codes, but this is unlikely to happen as it's either going to be too costly for the company or gamers would be unwilling to pay extra for a mistake that was ultimately not theirs.

Acemagic's Nintendo-inspired design takes a leaf out of Ayaneo's retro console cloning book.

A Chinese device maker is teasing a new mini PC inside a chassis that bears more than a passing resemblance to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Acemagic's blog and social media share images and a handful of specs for this AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 machine, which it has dubbed the Retro X5. The maker characterizes this mini PC as “an all-in-one solution created to simplify classic gaming,” which makes us wonder if it will come with Batocera Linux, SteamOS, or another non-Windows OS/UI.

Retro vibes. Modern mini PC.ACEMAGIC Retro X5 brings classic-inspired design to today's desktop, compact, clean, and built to evolve.Which classic would you revisit first?#ACEMAGIC #retrogames #MiniPC #Retro #AIPC pic.twitter.com/XC6ERlf2AhDecember 30, 2025

We don't know a lot about the hardware inside the Acemagic Retro X5 as yet. The Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 inside is a capable processor, though. It features a 4x Zen 5 performance cores and 8x Zen 5c efficiency cores for a total of 12 cores and 24 threads, running at up to 5.1GHz. Onboard is a decent iGPU in the shape of the Radeon 890M (RDNA 3+). This packs in 16 CUs and runs at up to 2.9 GHz. There's an XDNA 2 NPU with 50 TOPS, too.

If we are thinking about PC gaming with this processor, it should easily overshadow the Steam Deck. However, you will be targeting higher resolutions on a desktop. Also, as a mini PC, the HX 370 should run without the thermal constraints typically experienced in handheld or laptop designs. Thus, the Retro X5 might push this processor to the upper part of the processor's configurable 15-54W TDP range.

From the few images of the new mini PC we can see a USB-C, 2x Type-A, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a power button up front. We also know that the “Retro X5 supports expandable memory and storage, multiple display outputs, and high-speed connectivity,” as it says so on the blog. Hopefully, that means at least: twin SODIMM slots, twin M.2 SSD slots, HDMI, USB-C monitor connectivity, USB4 or USB5, OCuLink, and Ethernet, multiple extra ports along the back, and built-in Wi-Fi / BT.

It looks like Acemagic will try and differentiate its latest mini PC with some kind of launcher, dubbed RetroPlay Box, which you can see represented by swirling tiles in the Tweet embedded above. It could be an app that is pre-installed on Windows 11 – the least adventurous option.

There's also the chance that Acemagic might go with a Linux-based OS to host its RetroPlay Box. It may save money on a Windows license by choosing SteamOS or Batocera Linux, for example. We shall have to wait and see.

Acemagic is riding on the coattails of Ayaneo (and Nintendo) with its “inspired by iconic gaming consoles” design here. But, perhaps its timing, surfing the wave of retro-enthusiasm precipitated by Windows 11 disillusion, the rise of SteamOS, and yet another PC AAA gaming hardware cost crunch, will help it achieve better success.

The Acemagic Retro X5 is “coming soon,” according to the firm's social media postings.

Patients with Down syndrome had a substantially higher risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) than control individuals from the general population.

""By recognizing the higher risk of kidney disease in individuals with DS [Down syndrome], clinicians can work toward developing and testing targeted surveillance programs and individualized treatment plans,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Freja Leonore Uhd Weldingh, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. It was published online on December 23, 2025, in Clinical Kidney Journal.

This study lacked laboratory data for the earliest years, which may have introduced selection bias. Additionally, the analysis of AKI in children with Down syndrome relied on a small subpopulation, so the risk estimates were less precise.

This study was supported by Aarhus University's Research Foundation through a research year scholarship granted to the investigator. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Real-world clinical data from Finland revealed that although diabetes and diabetic kidney disease were common, many patients missed recommended kidney screening and discontinued indicated treatments, resulting in underdiagnosis, inadequate monitoring, and a substantial healthcare burden.

""[The study] data underline an urgent need for improved awareness and risk management in diabetes,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Merja K. Laine, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. It was published online on December 21, 2025, in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice.

Albuminuria and kidney function were determined from single measurements. The assessment of comorbidities relied on diagnostic codes that were subject to underreporting bias. The analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor persistence did not account for concomitant medications.

A 40-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who injected insulin into her abdomen developed a firm subcutaneous mass in the right lower quadrant. Pathology after surgical excision showed nodular cutaneous amyloidosis; mass spectrometry supported insulin injection-associated amyloid.

A case report by endocrinologist Meiying Zhuang, MD, and colleagues at Vancouver General Hospital, Canada, documents an underdiagnosed complication of repeated subcutaneous insulin injections.

The patient was referred to Vancouver General Hospital for a newly developed subcutaneous mass in the right lower abdominal quadrant, occasional night sweats, chills, paresthesias migrating between her face and extremities, and intermittent arthralgias in the ankles, knees, hips, and wrists. She denied fever, unintentional weight loss, cough, chest pain, rashes, or gastrointestinal complaints.

Past medical history was notable for foetal alcohol syndrome and T1DM diagnosed at age 5 years.

Her regular medication was insulin, administered by subcutaneous injections into the abdomen for T1DM.

Family, social, substance use, travel, and allergy histories were unremarkable.

At the referring physician's office, a biopsy of the lesion, measuring 1.1 × 1 × 0.8 cm, had been performed. Histology showed features of amyloidosis with strong Congo red staining.

On admission, vital signs were within normal limits, including respiratory and heart rates, blood pressure, room air oxygen saturation, and body temperature.

Inspection, auscultation, palpation, and percussion corroborated the history. The biopsy wound in the right lower abdominal quadrant appeared noninflamed and dry. A firm, nonmobile mass was palpable beneath it. Additional findings included leg oedema and mild, nonspecific motor and sensory deficits in both lower legs.

A neurologic examination, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis, revealed no abnormalities.

An expanded amyloidosis workup — including complete blood count, electrolytes, creatinine, liver function tests, serum free light chains, serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein electrophoresis, and urinalysis — yielded no definitive clues.

A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed a soft-tissue collection in the subcutaneous fat along the right anterior abdominal wall. No intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pathology was observed.

Echocardiography showed no evidence of amyloid deposition.

A repeat neurologic examination provided no new information.

After referral to the surgical department, the abdominal mass was excised. Subsequent histopathology revealed nodular cutaneous amyloidosis.

Given the patient's frequent abdominal insulin injections, insulin injection-associated amyloidosis was considered in the differential diagnosis.

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of a biopsy sample showed a peptide profile consistent with insulin-associated amyloid deposition. A definitive diagnosis could not be established.

“Insulin-derived amyloidosis is an underrecognized complication of repeated subcutaneous insulin injection at the same site,” the case authors wrote. Clinically, the complication can be easily mistaken for lipohypertrophy. Histologically, differentiation from light-chain amyloidosis is often challenging.

Overall, this is a benign condition. However, if insulin absorption and glycaemic control are impaired, surgical excision should be considered as both a diagnostic and therapeutic option.

Maresca guided Chelsea to Conference League and FIFA Club World Cup glory last season, while also securing Champions League qualification, and had been working on a contract through to 2029. He now finds himself out of work, with the Blues opening their hunt for a suitable successor.

A statement on the club's official website reads: ""Chelsea Football Club and Head Coach Enzo Maresca have parted company. During his time at the club, Enzo led the team to success in the UEFA Conference League and the FIFA Club World Cup. Those achievements will remain an important part of the Club's recent history, and we thank him for his contributions to the club.

""With key objectives still to play for across four competitions including qualification for Champions League football, Enzo and the club believe a change gives the team the best chance of getting the season back on track. We wish Enzo well for the future.""

The 45-year-old claimed to be lacking “support” from certain areas of the club, which was considered to be a nod towards Todd Boehly and Co in the boardroom. While victory was enjoyed over the Toffees, a three-game winless run has been endured in the Premier League since then.

Maresca's final game at the helm was a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth. Anger in the stands spilled out at the end of that contest, with the Blues being jeered from the field. They sit fifth in the English top-flight table heading into fixtures taking place on New Year's Day.

The Blues will be back in action on Sunday when taking in a testing trip to Manchester City. It remains to be seen who will be in charge of that contest, but Chelsea will want to move quickly when it comes to getting another permanent boss on board.

It has been suggested that Liam Rosenior, who is currently in charge of the Blues' sister club Strasbourg, is among those under consideration. He has never coached in the Premier League before, but has spent time with Derby and Hull City.

According to The Athletic, Chelsea remain “firmly behind the approach installed following the takeover by the Clearlake Capital-Todd Boehly consortium in 2022 with the next head coach expected to fit into it and quickly stabilise and improve results”.

The new man in the dugout will need to get disgruntled supporters back on side. Maresca earned plenty of credit after landing major silverware - having previously led Leicester to the Championship title when filling his first managerial role in England - but saw that evaporate late in 2025.

While he will not be lining up against Pep Guardiola again this weekend - having filled two roles among backroom staff at the Etihad Stadium - it has been claimed that he is viewed by City as a potential successor to their highly-decorated Catalan coach. Guardiola is known to be a big fan of his former right-hand man and has seen it suggested that he could walk away from Manchester at the end of the current campaign.

Maresca will be eager to land another role as quickly as possible, having proved his worth at the highest level. His overall record at Chelsea saw 55 victories collected from 92 games across all competitions, with 21 defeats being suffered. His tenure comes to a close while boasting a win ratio of 59.78 per cent.","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com', 'title': 'FOX Sports'}","soccer"

Britain Chelsea Maresca Soccer

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Chelsea was back on the coaching carousel under its American ownership on Thursday after Enzo Maresca left his position as manager following a reported deterioration in his relationship with the Premier League club's hierarchy.

The Italian coach was midway through his second year in charge, having won the Conference League and Club World Cup in his first season at Chelsea.

However, the team has endured a turbulent last few months — Chelsea has won just one of its last seven Premier League matches to drop to fifth place — while Maresca publicly expressed his unhappiness at a lack of support at the club in a post-match news conference on Dec. 13, when he said he had just experienced his “worst” 48 hours at Chelsea.

“With key objectives still to play for across four competitions including qualification for Champions League football,” Chelsea said in a statement, “Enzo and the club believe a change gives the team the best chance of getting the season back on track.”

Chelsea has advanced to the English League Cup semifinals, where it will play Arsenal over two legs, and begins its FA Cup campaign away to second-tier Charlton on Jan. 10. In the Champions League, Chelsea is in 13th place in the 36-team league, two points off the eight automatic qualification spots with two rounds of matches left.

Chelsea is seeking a fifth full-time manager since the takeover of the club by American investors, fronted by Todd Boehly, in May 2022.

In the past 3 1/2 years, Chelsea has spent hundreds of million of pounds (dollars) in what looked from the outside a chaotic bid to sign players to refresh its squad. It now has one of the youngest and most talented squads in the Premier League, with star players including Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Estevao, but managers have struggled to get the players to gel as a team after so many changes.

Out of all the managers to have led Chelsea in that period — and they include Thomas Tuchel and Mauricio Pochettino, the current coaches of England and the United States, respectively — Maresca appeared to have handled the chaos the best.

Yet he reportedly didn't feel appreciated given the tough working conditions and, according to the BBC, recently switched agents. A few weeks ago, media reports in England linked Maresca with a possible move to Man City — where he briefly worked under Pep Guardiola — should Guardiola eventually leave, though Maresca played the reports down.

Chelsea's results have taken a downturn since a 3-0 win over Barcelona in the Champions League in November.

The team's only league win in the past month was over Everton, 2-0. There have been draws with Arsenal, Newcastle and Bournemouth (twice) and losses to Leeds and Aston Villa.

Its next game is at plays second-place Manchester City on Sunday.

Chelsea said its achievements under Maresca “will remain an important part of the club's recent history, and we thank him for his contributions to the club.”

There was no immediate word on his potential successor.

MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Enzo Maresca left his post as Chelsea head coach on Thursday after a reported deterioration in his relationship with the Premier League club's hierarchy.

The Italian coach was midway through his second season in charge. In his first season, he won the Conference League and Club World Cup.

Last month, Maresca said he had experienced his “worst” 48 hours at Chelsea and expressed his unhappiness at a lack of support at the club, but didn't go into specific reasons.

Chelsea is in fifth place in the Premier League, but has won just one of its last seven league matches, and has advanced to the English League Cup semifinals, where it will play Arsenal over two legs.

“With key objectives still to play for across four competitions including qualification for Champions League football,” Chelsea said in a statement, “Enzo and the club believe a change gives the team the best chance of getting the season back on track.”

Chelsea is coming off a 2-2 home draw against Bournemouth in the league on Tuesday, and next plays second-place Manchester City away on Sunday.

The club said Chelsea's achievements under Maresca “will remain an important part of the club's recent history, and we thank him for his contributions to the club.”

There's less than 200 days to go until the start of the 2026 World Cup and a clearer picture is beginning to appear regarding the 26-player roster that will represent Mexico in next summer's sporting spectacle.

A World Cup on home soil has the entire country excited and anticipation is rapidly building, especially after Mexico's group stage journey was revealed during the 2026 World Cup draw. Fate was kind to El Tri during the draw, with favorable matchups to open the tournament only heightening expectations. 

A brilliant first semester in 2025 saw Mexico reestablish its dominance over the region with Concacaf Nations League and Gold Cup triumphs. However, a six game winless streak to end the year dampened the mood surrounding El Tri. 

It's obvious that Mexico's current generation of players don't have talent to spare, so success in the 2026 World Cup will depend on the collective strength of the team. Javier Aguirre must ace his roster selection if El Tri is to have any chance of a historic performance. 

Aguirre admitted that he already had over half of his World Cup roster set in stone following the Gold Cup, but after poor performances were crowned by a 2–1 defeat against Paraguay, he'll have plenty of time to reconsider. 

Here, Sports Illustrated predicts Mexico's 26-player roster for the 2026 World Cup, with the tournament less than seven months away.

Aguirre has used a variety of formations during his year-plus third stint as Mexico's manager, tailoring his side depending on the opponent in front. However, ever since El Tri's 2025 Gold Cup triumph, a 4-3-3 set-up has been “El Vasco's” go-to.

Only 26 players can make the final World Cup roster so we've stuck to that criteria. The projected roster is based on positional needs, recent squad selections and the hints Aguirre has revealed regarding his talent evaluation.

At this point in time, it's anyone's guess who'll be Mexico's starter between the sticks come the World Cup. 

Luis Ángel Malagón appeared to have the position locked up but a massive dip in form—and more importantly confidence—has turned the three-time Liga MX champion into a shell of his former self over the past six months. 

This has opened the door for Chivas goalkeeper Raúl Rangel to make a push for the starting job. Though far from perfect, the 25-year-old is a significant upgrade when it comes to ability on the ball, something Malagón has struggled with throughout his career. If the current trajectory persists, Rangel seems to have surpassed Malagón in Aguirre's depth chart.  

Still, the pair of goalkeepers will continue their open competition until the start of the tournament. 

Carlos Acevedo has been Mexico's third option in goal in recent camps. However, given it's unlikely he plays, it's probable Aguirre turns to former World Cup star and El Tri legend Guillermo Ochoa. The curly haired cult hero might be 40 years old, but he'd be a valuable and experienced presence in the dressing room.

César Montes and Johan Vásquez have matured into a very strong center back pairing that's able to compete against any forward line on any given day. They're both roster locks and if they arrive to the World Cup at peak form, the heart of defense could easily be Mexico's greatest asset. 

Jesús Orozco emerged over the past year as an extremely valuable backup, but a terrible ankle injury suffered in December has essentially ended his World Cup hopes, baring a miracle. Jesús Angulo returned to form with Tigres during the Apertura 2025 and, as a left-footed center back, he's the perfect alternative to replace Orozco on the roster. 

Angulo has experience playing with El Tri and would be another flexible tool at Aguirre's disposal. Still, his place on the final roster is far from guaranteed, with an open competition brewing to claim a center back spot on the final list. 

Having only three natural center backs on the list might seem confusing. However, Mexico has a number of versatile players—something Aguirre has prioritized—in other positions that are also capable of putting in a shift in the middle of the backline.

The devastating injury Rodrigo Huescas suffered in early October saw Aguirre change his approach to fullbacks. Mexico has developed a system in which they build up with a back three in possession, with the starting left back Jesús Gallardo darting up the pitch and Israel Reyes on the other side drifting centrally to offer defensive balance. 

Gallardo is a shoo-in to play his third World Cup and, in the wake of Huescas's injury, it's Reyes who's played the bulk of the minutes at right back. He's also a solid option at center back, where he's often deployed for Club América, adding a valuable wrinkle to his game. 

The tenacious Jorge Sánchez is a strong candidate to backup Reyes on the right. Meanwhile, young AZ Alkmaar left back Mateo Chávez has had a couple of impressive performances with El Tri and should be on the final roster barring any unforeseen circumstances. 

Kevin Álvarez, who featured in the 2022 World Cup, is a fringe option that has the potential of challenging Sánchez for a spot on Aguirre's roster.

Mexico's captain Edson Álvarez anchoring the midfield with Montés and Vásquez behind him completes what Aguirre named “The Triangle of Trust.” Álvarez is a duel-winning machine that protects the middle of the park, but it also wouldn't be surprising if he features at center back next summer, given he's El Tri's best alternative other than the starting duo. 

An argument could be made that Cruz Azul's Erik Lira has been one of Mexico's best players of the Aguirre era. His path to consistent playing time is blocked by Álvarez, but he'll be on the roster and could be a starter against opponents that sit back and allow Mexico to have the bulk of the ball. 

Toluca's Marcel Ruiz has become an undisputed starter as a box-to-box No. 8 that dictates Mexico's possessions. Then comes the biggest difference-maker in Mexico's roster: Gilberto Mora. The 17-year-old phenom is the key to unlocking El Tri's attack. 

Bound for a move to Europe after the World Cup, the Tijuana midfielder provides that hint of magic no other player on the roster can offer. 

Carlos Rodriguez and MLS's best young player of the year Obed Vargas are behind-the-scenes midfield pieces that could feature depending on the context of the game. The same goes for attacking midfielder Orbelín Pineda, a player Aguirre has tried endlessly to insert into Mexico's lineup. 

Those last three players are on the roster for now, but their spot isn't guaranteed in the slightest.

It's difficult to put into words how much Mexico has struggled to find production from its wingers since the start of the decade. 

Alexis Vega stands out from the bunch as the starter on the left wing if healthy. The Toluca attacker has been the best player in Liga MX over the past year, but is still yet to leave his mark with the national team. Nevertheless, his talent is unquestionable and he'll hope his second World Cup appearance is better than his first. 

All signs point to Roberto Alvarado being the starter on the right wing. Although he's not a one-on-one threat, he's got an educated left foot and Aguirre's repeatedly praised his ability to cut inside to link-up with other attackers in the final third. 

Diego Lainez and former World Cup hero Hirving “Chucky” Lozano have elevated their status with the national team in recent months, featuring in the last three El Tri camps of 2025. They seem to have carved themselves a backup role at the very least.

There was plenty of expectation put on Julián Quiñones when the Colombia-born attacker switched his allegiance to Mexico prior to the 2024 Copa América. He's failed to live up to the hype for now, but he's still got every chance to make the World Cup roster, especially if he keeps producing in the Saudi Pro League.

For the first time in his career and entering his fourth World Cup, Raúl Jiménez is poised to spearhead Mexico's attack next summer. The Fulham striker has resurrected his career with El Tri over the past year, accounting for almost half of the goals Aguirre's side scored in 2025. He's been nothing short of sensational for Mexico and the bulk of the attacking burden will be placed on him come the World Cup despite him being 35 when the tournament starts.

AC Milan's Santiago Gimenez was touted by many to play alongside Jiménez next summer. Aguirre struggled to accommodate the pair in the same XI and Gimenez's dreadful start of the season and recent injury woes makes it hard to imagine he'll be anything but a backup next summer. Still, if healthy, the fan-favorite's place in the roster is more than likely. 

Armando González, the breakout star of the Liga MX Apertura 2025 season, has raised his hand to compliment El Tri's forward line in the World Cup. If he can keep up his level during the next six months, he's got every chance to play himself into a more prominent role. 

Argentina-born striker Germán Berterame completes the forward line. Aguirre values his tireless work rate and his agility in tight spaces, but mostly his versatility given he's been often deployed as a right winger during his short career with El Tri.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Antoine Semenyo billed as another Cristiano Ronaldo or David Beckham for Man Utd as Red Devils mull over joining transfer chase for £65m Bournemouth star","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/antoine-semenyo-cristiano-ronaldo-david-beckham-man-utd-red-devils-transfer-65m-bournemouth-star/blt29688b8fba47420b","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:21:09 GMT","

Manchester United have been told that Antoine Semenyo could become another Cristiano Ronaldo or David Beckham for them, with the Ghana international poised to leave Bournemouth in the January transfer window. The Red Devils form part of that £65 million ($87m) race, and Dwight Yorke has urged them to pip Premier League rivals to a much sought-after signature.

It appears inevitable that Semenyo will be on the move before the winter window of 2026 slams shut, with there a release clause in his contract that can be triggered by any member of his ever-growing list of suitors.

Manchester City are reported to be leading the chase for a powerful forward that netted 13 goals last season and has another nine to his name this term. Liverpool have also been credited with interest amid the uncertainty surrounding Mohamed Salah's future at Anfield.

Yorke is, however, of the opinion that United should be doing all they can to bring another exciting winger to Old Trafford. The 1999 Treble winner has told PokerScout: “Antoine Semenyo is probably one of the best players, if not the best player, in the Premier League right now in terms of what he's doing, and taking into consideration the team that he's actually playing for.

“If he was to go and play with better teams, better players, his potential would be huge. There is a reason why all the top teams are interested, because of his consistency and what he's been doing.

“For Manchester United, he would get fans off their seats, I think he's an exceptional player. Is he going to fit in there? What is he going to bring to the United team? I think he could take the ball up the pitch, to relieve the defenders.

“I think it would be a significant move from the manager's standpoint. Over the years when United have always played, they have players who take the ball up high up the pitch, which relieves the defenders, Semenyo can do that.

“It's been key to United's success over the years. Andrei Kanchelskis, to Ryan Giggs, to David Beckham, to Cristiano Ronaldo, to Antonio Valencia, those type of players always get the ball, take it really high and deep into the opposition half. That's what he would bring as well as goals and his creativity. I think he'll be an exceptional player, but not as a wing-back.

“Where Ruben Amorim wants him to play will have a big impact on his decision. If I was him. I'm not going to be playing as a wing-back, taking away my ability to create. I would suggest an initial conversation, but he's certainly a player that not just United, but City and everybody else would love to have in their team at this present time.”

While calling on United to bolster their ranks, Yorke is also hoping that key personnel can be retained. Club captain Bruno Fernandes continues to see questions asked of his future, amid talk of interest from the Saudi Pro League, but Champions League qualification could convince the Portuguese midfielder to stay put.

Yorke added: “Bruno Fernandes has certainly been the talisman of the football club for the past five years. Marcus Rashford, in his best season, scored 30-plus goals, but Bruno has always been a significant player.

“United have always had really good attacking players and Bruno has fit that without a doubt. He's been incredible for the football team over the past five years or so. He was resilient in that he didn't want to go to Saudi, I think that it's good that the manager backed him at that moment. It's turned out to be the right decision from a Manchester United standpoint.

“I wonder if Bruno's mindset is more positive now, since they added Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to the team, which gives them a little bit more attacking force. Are they a far better team than what they were? They've slightly improved, with [Benjamin] Sesko as well. I think the front attacking players have always been good. It's just the middle to back is the one that I think they can still improve on. Would they close the gap? Would they win anything with Ruben Amorim going into the next campaign? I still think there is work to do.

“I would like to think that Bruno will look at the whole season come the end of the year. I think he will remain there, but if United fall off and fail to qualify for the Champions League, I think that will change the whole dimension of what he's thinking might be. At the end of the season, Bruno has to find what is best for him at the end of the day and he has to meet that goal.”

United are currently sat sixth in the Premier League standings, with consistency still proving to be elusive. They were held to a disappointing 1-1 draw by rock-bottom Wolves last time out, leading to more questions being asked of Amorim, and desperately need a positive performance in their first fixture of 2026 against old adversaries Leeds on Sunday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Neymar has reportedly ended the speculation linking him with a move to Inter Miami or a return to Europe by agreeing a new contract with Santos. The veteran Brazilian superstar, who retraced steps to his roots in January 2025, is poised to sign fresh terms that will take him through the 2026 World Cup finals and to the end of another calendar year.

According to Globo Esporte, Neymar has a deal in place with Santos that will keep him at Vila Belmiro until December 31, 2026. It had appeared at one stage as though the 33-year-old playmaker was destined to take on a new challenge after hitting free agency.

He is, however, currently working through another rehabilitation programme, having undergone knee surgery, and is happy to remain in familiar surroundings that keep him close to family and friends.

While Santos are understandably delighted to see their talismanic captain commit to a new deal, Globo reports on how he costs the club the same amount per month as “four or five regular players”. He also has an image rights contract with NR Sports that tops up his pay packet.

Neymar has agreed to stay put after ending the 2025 season in style, as he helped to steer Santos away from relegation danger. After returning from a hamstring problem in November, he hit five goals across seven games - including a hat-trick against Juventude.

Questions were asked on a regular basis of whether the former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain forward would look for a fresh start in what is a World Cup year. He needs to be playing regularly in order to make Carlo Ancelotti's squad for another major tournament.

Neymar, who is Brazil's all-time leading scorer with 79 goals to his name through 128 caps, has not represented his country since suffering knee ligament damage in September 2023. He has, however, vowed to be ready for another shot at global glory.

He told reporters recently: “We will do everything possible, even the impossible, to bring this World Cup back to Brazil.” He went on to say of aiding that quest: “If we reach the final, I promise to score.”

Ex-PSG, AC Milan, Chelsea and Real Madrid boss Ancelotti has left the door open for Neymar to earn an international recall, but has spoken on a regular basis of how sentiment will not be allowed to impact his selections.

It has been made clear to Neymar that he will have to earn his place. Italian tactician Ancelotti has said: “We talk about Neymar, we have to talk about other players. We have to think about Brazil, which can be with Neymar or without Neymar, with other players or without other players.

“The definitive list we will make after the FIFA date in March. I understand very well that people are very interested in Neymar. I want to clarify that we are in December, the World Cup is in June, I will choose the team that will go to the World Cup in May. If Neymar deserves to be, if he is well, better than someone else, he will play in the World Cup. I don't owe anyone a debt.”

Neymar has much to prove as he has missed a total of 89 games since moving to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal in 2023. An unfortunate ACL injury led to his lucrative contract in the Middle East being terminated, while more fitness issues have been endured back home at Santos.

He has undergone another operation on his left knee and is said to be working with renowned Brazilian physiotherapist Eduardo Santos - a man who has been dubbed ‘Dr Miracle' after previously helping the likes of Philippe Coutinho and Matheus Cunha to make speedy recoveries from serious knee problems.

In committing to that plan, Neymar - who had been linked with teams in Italy and the English Premier League - has ruled out a reunion with ex-Barcelona team-mates Messi and Luis Suarez at MLS Cup winners Inter Miami.

It had been suggested that their fabled ‘MSN' strike force could be reformed in the United States, but any move to South Florida has been delayed indefinitely. Neymar does, however, have plenty to play for across the next 12 months.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Incredible turn of events sees Gabon government SUSPEND national team & kick out ex-Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after 'disgraceful' AFCON performance","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/gabon-government-suspend-national-team-kick-out-ex-arsenal-striker-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-afcon/bltf48578e1e510663c","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 16:00:56 GMT","

In an incredible turn of events, Gabon's government has announced that it has suspended the national team after their horrendous African Cup of Nations campaign, and have also sacked their manager, whilst removing ex-Arsenal and Chelsea striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from the squad altogether.

Gabon endured a nightmarish campaign at AFCON, as they lost all three games they played. The Panthers lost their opener 1-0 to Cameroon, before going down 3-2 in a thriller against Mozambique. They were then beaten 3-2, again, by the Ivory Coast, thanks to an injury-time strike from Bazoumana Toure. Now, Gabon's government have announced they have sacked boss Thierry Mouyouma, and have also confirmed that Aubameyang, as well as veteran defender Bruno Ecuele Manga, have been excluded from the squad. 

Manager Mouyouma was only the second manager to guide Gabon to the AFCON, favouring a high-pressing, high intensity style of play that had drawn success in qualification. At the tournament, though, Gabon were leaky, and unable to turn their high-press into wins.

Mouyouma and Aubameyang were at the centre of news stories during the tournament due to doubts over the latter's fitness. 

The Gabon boss responded: ""This contempt must stop. We are playing in an Africa Cup of Nations, not a recovery camp. The player was tested, examined, and cleared by our medical staff and by the CAF medical commission.

""During FIFA dates, players belong to their countries. I simply ask for respect for our work, our decisions, and our ambitions.""

Gabon's acting sports minister made a public address 24 hours after the side's defeat to Cote d'Ivoire. 

Simplice-Desire Mamboula said: ""Given the Panthers' disgraceful performance at the Total Energies Morocco 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, and considering the multifaceted effects that are diametrically opposed to the values of ethics and exemplarity advocated by the Fifth Republic, the Government has decided: to dissolve the technical staff; to suspend the national team until further notice; to remove players Bruno Ecuele Manga and Pierre Emerick Aubameyang from the team.

""Furthermore, the Government calls on the Gabonese Football Federation to assume all its responsibilities.""

Aubameyang has hit back, having scored in the game against Mozambique, and said that the team's problems ""are much deeper than the individual I am."" He missed the clash with Cote d'Ivoire after suffering an injury.

Gabon have never won AFCON, and have never actually gone beyond the quarter-finals, reaching the last-eight in 1996 and 2012, the latter as hosts. Aubameyang's ban from selection may bring the curtain down on a lengthy international career. In total, he won 49 caps, scoring 28 goals, having played for his country between 2009 and 2025. It appears, though, that he will not play again. The same goes for Ecuele Manga, who has 118 caps for his country, and has played for the likes of Cardiff City and Lorient, and is now 37.

Gabon's international team has been suspended at present. They had hoped to reach the 2026 World Cup, having finished second in their qualifying group, but they lost in the play-offs to Nigeria, being thumped 4-1. It remains to be seen when the national team will be put back together; FIFA has usually taken a hard stance against the idea of nations disbanding their teams, and is a rarity now in African football.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Wrexham star's stunning volley helps Phil Parkinson's side down Blackburn Rovers & edge ever-closer to Championship play-off spots","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/ollie-rathbone-wrexham-volley-phil-parkinson-blackburn-rovers-championship-play-off-spots/blt4ec1a8c03d6c3fcb","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 14:26:00 GMT","

A rocket from Ollie Rathbone and an impressive finish from Sam Smith saw Wrexham to a 2-0 victory away at Blackburn. It proved to be a happy New Year for the Red Dragons at Ewood Park as they opened 2026 in style. Phil Parkinson's side have taken maximum points from their last three fixtures in the Championship and remain within sight of the play-off places.

Having enjoyed a record-breaking run of three successive promotions, Wrexham are daring to dream that a fourth may still be on the cards. They have found form at a vital, and busy, stage of the season.

They needed just 11 minutes to get their noses in front at Blackburn, with Sam Smith making the most of his opportunity to impress from the start following an unfortunate injury to fellow striker and leading goalscorer Kieffer Moore.

A perfectly-flighted pass from Matty James sent Smith, who had beaten the offside trap, scampering into space. As the ball sat up in front of him, a composed left-footed volley was fired in at the near post.

Rathbone spun inside the box before seeing a shot deflected away for a corner a couple of minutes later, while midway through the first half Smith was unable to slide a low cross from Ryan Longman home after being faced with an impossible angle.

With Rovers offering little at the opposite end of the field, Wrexham doubled their lead in the 38th minute. They did so in some style as - after Blackburn failed to clear a free-kick - Rathbone watched the ball drop over his shoulder and crashed a stunning strike back across goal and into the net.

Both teams came close in the space of 60 seconds just before the hour mark, with Moussa Baradji spurning a glorious chance to drag the hosts back into the game. After driving into the area, he went for power over precision and saw his ferocious effort cannon off the underside of the crossbar and out.

Moments later, following good hold-up play from Smith, Lewis O'Brien drilled straight at Aynsley Pears when presented with a clear sight of the target. There was to be no late drama, despite Blackburn dominating possession, with Parkinson ready to turn his attention to the January transfer market as more funds are requested from Hollywood co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac.

Rathbone is a Blackburn native, having been born in the town where his father Mick remains a legend from his playing days. He was, however, in no mood to endear himself to the locals when taking to the field in front of his dad - who took up a seat in the stands. The all-action midfielder epitomised what Wrexham's performance was all about as he ran himself into the ground and snapped into tackles.

He also netted a spectacular goal, with the ball being lashed into the back of the net after displaying impressive technique. It initially appeared as though he would choose not to celebrate, but said strike was too good not to be toasted in style.

In the battle of the bosses, Valerien Ismael came out second best. His side struggled to get to grips with Wrexham's physicality and energy early on, which led them to falling behind. Rovers have now won just one of their last nine games, leading to them slipping alarmingly down the table and potentially into a relegation battle.

Another injury was also suffered against the Red Dragons, as Matthew Litherland was forced off in the second half, and fitness issues are beginning to mount. That is doing Ismael few favours, with a disgruntled fan base already beginning to air its displeasure.

Chelsea met with Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi in the summer, prior to the sacking of Enzo Maresca, but the Blues are playing down the prospect of appointing the former Brighton head coach. Maresca was axed on New Year's Day and the club are now searching for replacements, with Strasbourg's Liam Rosenior a current frontrunner.

Per BBC Sport's Nizaar Kinsella, the Blues met with the Marseille boss in the summer as they considered replacing Maresca. However, the club are now said to be playing down the prospect of appointing the former Brighton manager. They also held an interview with Kieran McKenna, the Ipswich Town boss, before appointing Maresca in 2024, but are now looking to bring in a boss with the same style of play as Maresca. Strasbourg coach Liam Rosenior is a strong candidate, with BlueCo owning both clubs, and candidates will be drawn from a ""wide field"". 

Marseille are currently attempting to launch a Ligue 1 title bid, and sit third in the French top-flight, five points behind current leaders Lens. They are also four points behind Paris Saint-Germain, in second, and face Luis Enrique's side in the Trophees des Champions final this month.

He has been very open about his desire to remain at Marseille for the foreseeable future, saying: ""I still see myself here in the long term. I would like to go beyond three years and be one of the most influential coaches here.

""I feel good here, even amid the criticism and the commotion. I don't get offended – a lot of the criticism is made in bad faith. I want to stay here for a long time if everyone is happy. It's a privilege to work here.""

Speaking last month, president Pablo Longoria said: ""I'm happier every day to work with Roberto De Zerbi. With someone of this extraordinary caliber – he's one of the best coaches in Europe. He's starting to speak French, which is a good sign about his adaptation and how he envisions his future. 

""In the professional world, you have to see if everyone's expectations are aligned. You also have to align yourself with De Zerbi's ambition.""

He has also garnered controversy for his vocal support of Mason Greenwood, as well as his penchant for temper tantrums.

Strasbourg boss Rosenior is the early frontrunner to become Chelsea's next manager. The French club, in which BlueCo have a stake, are currently seventh in Ligue 1, and the former Derby County defender has been open about his desire to eventually manage in the Premier League. 

Speaking in 2024, he wrote for Coaches' Voice: “My ambition now is to manage in the Premier League, and I feel ready – not least because the games where I have been at my best as a coach have been possession-based. Maybe it's not going to be my next step, but the next step has to be to give myself, my staff and my club the best opportunity to be a Premier League team next season.”

Chelsea face Manchester City on Sunday as they bid to steady the ship and right their season. They sit fifth in the Premier League table, two points behind fourth-placed Liverpool and 15 behind leaders Arsenal. Maresca had a contract that ran until 2029 but the club are still competing in the Premier League, the League Cup (they face Arsenal in a two-legged semi-final this month), and the Champions League, while they will enter the FA Cup at the third-round stage with a fixture against Charlton Athletic.

""With key objectives still to play for across four competitions including qualification for Champions League football, Enzo and the club believe a change gives the team the best chance of getting the season back on track,"" Chelsea said in their statement confirming Maresca's departure.

Against City, they will not have Maresca in the dugout, and the club have not actually announced who will be standing in for the axed Italian.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","‘Captain America' Christian Pulisic ‘can't always save' AC Milan as legendary coach tells Rossoneri they are ‘too dependent' on USMNT star","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/captain-america-christian-pulisic-save-ac-milan-rossoneri-too-dependent-usmnt-star/bltb5e589fe249a6899","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 14:00:03 GMT","

AC Milan have been warned that ‘Captain America' Christian Pulisic “can't always save” them, with the Rossoneri becoming “too dependent” on their USMNT star. That is the opinion of legendary coach Fabio Capello, who continues to keep an eye across events at San Siro. He is not convinced that Pulisic can deliver Serie A title glory with Golden Boot-winning exploits.

The United States international is, despite enduring the odd injury setback this season, very much in that race at present. Pulisic has eight goals to his name in the Italian top-flight and has reached double figures across all competitions.

Inter striker Lautaro Martinez is the leading marksman in Serie A at the start of 2026, but is only one effort clear of Pulisic. The World Cup-winning Argentine is a central striker and more proven performer in the final third of the field.

Pulisic is showing that he can keep pace with the best in the business, but can impressive individual standards be maintained in a collective bid for Scudetto glory? He may need to in order for Milan to cross the line in first place.

Quizzed on who will end 2025-26 as Serie A's leading scorer - with Napoli loanee Rasmus Hojlund, Roma playmaker Matias Soule and Juventus sensation Kenan Yildiz also in the mix - Capello told Gazzetta dello Sport: “Lautaro is a regular at scoring important goals, so it would be easy to answer with the Inter captain. However, I'm also very impressed by Hojlund, who is in sensational form and can reassure Antonio Conte about Lukaku's return.

“A little further back, I see the strikers of Milan, Juventus and Roma. The Rossoneri are too dependent on Pulisic, especially without [Rafael] Leao, but the American can't always save his team-mates from trouble.

“Yildiz is a great talent, he's finding exceptional consistency in both goals and assists, but we mustn't forget that he's still very young. Finally, Soule has 11-12 goals under his belt, but he hasn't yet been decisive in big matches.”

Ex-Milan player and manager Capello has previously said of Pulisic's value to the Rossoneri cause and how they can get the best out of him: “Pulisic can truly play anywhere; he even looks perfect in his current role in a 3-5-2 formation. He moves well, he has quality and speed and makes vertical runs. I feel that starting in a central position suits him better. He becomes more dangerous when he's free to move.”

Pulisic continues to star on a regular basis when fit, with Milan looking to help the 27-year-old add to his medal collection. He savoured Supercoppa Italiana glory last season and now has his sights set on the Serie A crown.

Capello added on that quest, with Milan benefitting from a lack of midweek action in Europe: “Massimiliano Allegri will always have the week off to focus his players on a single objective, having also been eliminated from the Coppa Italia.

“In the first part of the season, Milan had a few slumps in concentration against smaller teams, but I expect Max, taking advantage of the ‘lighter' schedule compared to their rivals, to fix things. And you can do this if you have plenty of time to prepare not only tactically, but above all psychologically for each match.

“There's another aspect not to be underestimated: cup competitions, in addition to the physical and especially mental energy, sometimes sap your enthusiasm. A bad result or elimination, for example, can also generate negative consequences on the league campaign, because they make the whole atmosphere more burdensome.”

Milan will be hoping that they can sustain a title challenge in 2025-26 as they need to convince Pulisic that they are heading in the right direction. A talismanic presence at San Siro has delayed the signing of a new contract.

Fresh talks are said to have been lined up for the spring, with the Rossoneri confident that an agreement can be reached, but they need to match the ambition of a man that will be leading his country into a home World Cup this summer.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Scouting Report: Fritz, Zverev & Auger-Aliassime among ATP stars to watch at United Cup","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/united-cup-2026-scouting-report","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 02:53:01 GMT","

For the fourth consecutive season, the calendar begins with the United Cup, a mixed-teams event featuring top ATP and WTA stars in Australia.

This year the event again features 18 countries across six groups in Sydney and Perth. ATPTour.com looks at five things to watch at the United Cup with a preview of the Brisbane International presented by ANZ and the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open to come later in the week.

1) United States defending champion: In three editions of the United Cup, the United States has emerged victorious twice. Taylor Fritz has been a consistent presence for his country at the mixed-teams event and he returns with Coco Gauff to defend their trophy. Twelve months ago the Americans swept Poland in the final and they will try to hold off the 17 other countries in the competition. 

Individually, Fritz has tallied a 9-3 singles record at the United Cup since 2023, including victories against Alexander Zverev, Hubert Hurkacz and Matteo Berrettini, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He enters the season as the No. 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings.

2) Auger-Aliassime among Top-10 talent: There are eight ATP singles players who are in or have been in the world's Top 10 competing in the United Cup. The current Top-10 stars are Germany's Zverev, Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime, the United States' Fritz and Australia's Alex de Minaur. 

World No. 5 Auger-Aliassime in particular arrives at the United Cup with momentum. The Canadian is fresh off the best season of his career, qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals for the second time. Auger-Aliassime made a Masters 1000 final in Paris and won three ATP Tour titles in 2025 in addition to his run to the US Open semi-finals. The 25-year-old and 19-year-old Victoria Mboko headline their country's lineup in Sydney, where they visited with koalas and kangaroos at the zoo Wednesday.



Former World No. 2 Casper Ruud (Norway), former World No. 3s Stefanos Tsitsipas (Greece) and Stan Wawrinka (Switzerland), and Poland's Hurkacz will also be in action. De Minaur will take on Ruud in Group D and Zverev will face Hurkacz in Group F, with both matches in Sydney at Ken Rosewall Arena. 

3) De Minaur flies Australian flag: De Minaur loves playing at home, especially in his native Sydney, where he won his first ATP Tour title in 2019 as a 19-year-old. The home favourite leads the way for Australia on a team ATP No. 1 Club member Lleyton Hewitt captains. Maya Joint, the country's top WTA player, competes in the United Cup for the first time. But it will be De Minaur who spearheads the charge at an event where he has beaten Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Zverev and Fritz.





4) Mensik a man to watch: The 2025 season featured the breakout of Jakub Mensik to the big stage. The Czech righty began the season just inside the Top 50 and finished it as a Top-20 star with an Masters 1000 title to his name. The Miami champion established himself as a fearless contender no matter the stage, and will bring his game to the United Cup for the first time. The 20-year-old will need to be sharp from the first ball in Sydney, where he will play De Minaur and Ruud in Group D.

5) Hurkacz returns: Big-serving Pole Hurkacz has helped Poland reach the United Cup final twice and will try to do so again in 2026. But this also marks the 28-year-old's first tournament since June in ‘s-Hertogenbosch due to a knee injury. The former World No. 6 will seek revenge against Zverev, who beat him in the 2024 United Cup final. He will also play Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor, against whom he owns a 3-2 Lexus ATP Head2Head advantage.

 Rafael Jodar impressed on his Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in Jeddah last month, and the 19-year-old Spaniard has now announced his decision to turn pro ahead of the 2026 season. 

 Jodar posted on Instagram on Wednesday announcing he would bring his US college career to a close after representing the University of Virginia Hoosiers across 2024 and 2025. The 19-year-old Jodar went 2-1 in Jeddah in December, when he earned group-stage wins against top seed and eventual champion Learner Tien and Martin Landaluce. 

A post shared by Rafa Jódar (@rafa.jodarr)

 “After a period of deep reflection, careful consideration and many conversations with my family and coaches, I have decided to forgo my remaining college eligibility at UVA and pursure my professional tennis career as of 2026,” wrote Jodar. “My time in college has played a huge role in my growth both as a player and as a person, and I now feel prepared to take this next step and embrace a new challenge in my life.” 

 Having also won three ATP Challenger titles in 2025, Jodar will begin life as a pro as the No. 168 in the PIF ATP Rankings. He reached his career high of No. 166 in early November, after lifting the third of his three Challenger crowns in Charlottesville.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Best of United Cup Perth Media Day 1: Osaka's honest view of balancing motherhood, tennis","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4426385/united-cup-2026-perth-media-day-1-naomi-osakas-honest-view-of-balancing-parenthood-tennis-sakkari-bouzas-maneiro-sierra","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 09:02:37 GMT","

From Naomi Osaka's thoughtful view on balancing motherhood with competition to Maria Sakkari's motivation to return to tennis' elite, the first Media Day at the United Cup in Perth gave us a glimpse of some players' offseasons and 2026 aspirations ahead of competition beginning Jan. 2.

PERTH, Australia -- Prior to Japan's press conference at the first media day of the United Cup in Perth, Naomi Osaka noticed Switzerland's Belinda Bencic with her 1-year-old daughter on the court. 

""I thought that was really, really cute, and it made me think of my daughter, as well,"" Osaka said.

This offseason, Osaka prioritized spending time with her daughter, Shai. 

After a 2025 season that saw Osaka rise from No. 57 to No. 16 in the PIF WTA Rankings, the four-time Grand Slam champion learned more about the balance of offseason training and her role as a mother. 

""It's definitely really tough,"" Osaka said on finding that balance. ""This offseason was quite difficult for me as well because you try to be there for her all the time. Obviously there are moments where you have to practice or have to do something. I hope that I'm managing or juggling it well.""

Since giving birth in July 2023, Osaka discussed how parenthood has shifted her mindset on the court. Prior, she said she was pretty hard on herself, often defining herself by wins and losses, but she's come to understand the broader perspective that has helped her shift her thinking positively. 

""It's evolved my career by just shifting my mindset a lot,"" Osaka said. ""If you knew me before, I would take everything so seriously. I'm just taking it like every day is a new opportunity to do better. At the same time, I know that my biggest role isn't a tennis player, it's to be a mom to my daughter. I'm really happy that I was able to learn that, and I'm excited to see what more I can do.""

Playing in Group E featuring Greece and Great Britain, Osaka will face Maria Sakkari on Jan. 2 and Emma Raducanu on Jan. 4 in her first two singles matches of the 2026 season. 

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

Around this time last year, Maria Sakkari was competing in the United Cup after an offseason filled with rehab from a shoulder injury that cut her 2024 season short. In May 2025, her ranking fell to No. 92 after starting the year seeded 31st at the Australian Open. Frankly, Sakkari felt the season was difficult.

Still, the 30-year-old climbed her way to just outside the top 50, and entered the offseason much healthier than a year prior. 

""It was a very, very tough season last year. I'm not going to lie,"" Sakkari said. ""It wasn't easy to handle, but at the same time, I feel like I learned a lot. I just had some time to recover and just think about the things I want to improve for this season.

""I had five weeks of very good practice and had time to put in a lot of work and just think of the things that I want to work on. It went really well, but the results will show how good of a work we did put [in].""

Sakkari said she's confident she can get back to where she once was -- the Greek reached a career-high rank of No. 3 back in 2022. She's slated to face two Grand Slam champions in Osaka and Raducanu to begin her 2026 season. Though holding a 3-2 advantage in the head-to-head with Osaka, they haven't faced since 2021, while Sakkari vies for her first career win over Raducanu. 

""They're very, very tough matches. Two very different players,"" Sakkari said. ""Naomi's an ultra-aggressive player. She has been playing very good the second half of the season of last year. Emma, I have a negative record against her obviously I'm aware of that, but she's a solid player. Both of them are very tough to play.

""As I said, I've worked on things. I'm going to try and deliver them on the court and see how it goes.""

Argentina's Solana Sierra and Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro will face World No. 3 Coco Gauff for the first time when their respective countries meet in Group A in Perth. It's a tall, but opportunistic task for both players who made strides over the 2025 season. 

Bouzas Maneiro enters Perth at a career-high rank of No. 41. The Spaniard had a successful summer where she reached the quarterfinals at the National Bank Open in Montreal and Round of 16 at Wimbledon and Cincinnati. 

""I think that I believe more in myself,"" Bouzas Maneiro said. ""I believe that I can won more matches against other players and top players in the world. That was of the main point for me last year.""

Bouzas Maneiro said she's expecting to advance further in tournaments more consistently, and continue to compete against the world's best. She'll open her third United Cup campaign against Sierra on Friday, before squaring off against Gauff.

""[I'll] play against two amazing players,"" Bouzas Maneiro said. ""[I've known] Solana since years ago, we practiced a lot together so I know that it's going to be a tough match. Of course, we will be ready for it. Coco is one of the best players in the world. I'm really excited to play against her and to see where is my level.""

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

Sierra's 2025 campaign saw the 21-year-old ascend from outside the top 150 to No. 66, catapulted by a Round of 16 run at Wimbledon, where she was the first lucky loser to do so. She also won a WTA 125 title in Mallorca, Spain and WTT 75 title in Bellinzona, Switzerland, boosting her to the No. 1 Argentinian. 

""I think it was a great year for me,"" said Sierra, who is making her debut at the United Cup. ""I did a lot of good results that I wanted. I'm really excited to start the year here. I think it's a really good preparation.""

Following the United Cup and the WTA 250 in Hobart, Sierra will make her main draw debut at the Australian Open. She's competed in qualifying the past two years, but lost both her first-round qualifiers. 

""It's [my] first time I am playing in main draw, first experience for me, all new. But yeah, super happy. I will try my best on every tournament.""

The United Cup offers a unique way for players to begin their seasons with a team competition, where one loss in singles or mixed-doubles might not eliminate them from the competition. 

""We've been playing for the last four years since the event started,"" said Sakkari, who has played at every edition of the United Cup. ""It seems like we kind of like it. It's our third time in Perth, which we really enjoy playing here of course. We like the team spirit because we rarely have it during the year.""

Osaka has watched the United Cup on television the past couple of years, and said she's always wanted to play in it. She was originally slated to compete at the ASB Classic in Auckland this week, but withdrew to represent Japan in the country's debut at the event. 

""I think for me, just it being such a good team atmosphere. I've always kind of watched United Cup on the TV,"" Osaka said. ""I've wanted to play for a long time.

""That's another important part of playing United Cup, being able to play the best players in the world straight off the bat, which I think is a privilege. I really enjoy matches like that.""

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka is used to dictating play on her own terms on the court. Now, she's doing the same off it, leaning into her personal brand to help shape her public narrative.Sabalenka was the most dominant player on the WTA Tour in 2025, claiming four titles while leading the tour in both match wins and prize money.

“On the court and off the court, it's two different people.”

On court, Sabalenka is known for her explosive game: huge serves, booming groundstrokes, and a relentless competitive edge. In 2025, she captured her fourth Grand Slam title at the US Open, reached two more major finals at the Australian Open and Roland Garros, and lifted WTA 1000 trophies in Madrid and Wuhan. She finished the year as world No. 1 for the second consecutive season.Off the court, however, she's long struggled to reconcile that ferocity with her easygoing, bubbly personality.“I don't like watching myself playing,” she admitted in a Boardroom interview. “I get annoyed by the way I am on court because it's so different, and it's so aggressive, and I feel embarrassed every time. Even though I understand this is the way I have to be successful in what I do.”That disconnect helped fuel her desire to let fans see more of her off-court self—an effort that's evolved into a social media presence that's paying off in a big way.

Fans have embraced it. Sabalenka has amassed 3.9 million Instagram followers, surpassing rivals Iga Swiatek (2.3 million) and Coco Gauff (2.2 million), while continuing to grow a loyal audience through TikTok and other platforms.“I just wanted to share myself with people, so the fans could know me and get more support when I'm playing,” Sabalenka explains.“Nowadays, I love playing on the big stadiums.

I feel connected with the crowd, and I feel like people have also connected with me.“That's been the main goal of sharing so much.”Brands are taking notice as well.

The move appears to have paid off. Sabalenka's estimated 2025 earnings reached approximately $30 million, including a WTA-record $15 million in prize money. The other half came from off-court income through partnerships with Nike, Audemars Piguet, Whoop, and Maestro Dobel, along with newer deals involving Electrolit, IM8, and more. Those earnings helped her rank as the second-highest-paid female athlete, according to Forbes and Sportico.Read More: Coco Gauff is Forbes' highest-earning female athlete for second year runningAs for what's next, Sabalenka is eager to keep building.

Ahead of the 2026 campaign, F1.com's Lawrence Barretto shares his five bold predictions for what might unfold.

After a recharge and almost certainly too many mince pies, I knuckled down to pen one of the trickiest but most fun features to write of the year – my five bold predictions for the year ahead. The new chassis and power unit regulations mean there's even greater uncertainty about this year's pecking order and therefore even greater scope for me to get them horribly wrong – but I've given it my best shot. So, here goes...

The ground-effect era has not been a fun time for Mercedes. The Silver Arrows entered the period in 2022 as eight-time defending World Champions, and leave it having failed to ever get on top of the rules and subsequently never contending for either title.

Say What? Best of team radio 2025

Iconic Nico Hulkenberg onboards

With Isack Hadjar confirmed as Max Verstappen's Red Bull team mate in 2026, Team Principal Laurent Mekies has revealed what the squad will be hoping to see from the Frenchman.

Laurent Mekies has shared an insight into Red Bull's expectations for Isack Hadjar as the French driver prepares to make the step up from Racing Bulls to partner Max Verstappen at the squad in 2026.

After a tricky start to his rookie campaign in F1 – in which he spun out on the rain-affected formation lap of the Australian Grand Prix – Hadjar quickly bounced back and went on to score several points finishes throughout the year, including a maiden podium at Zandvoort.

It was later confirmed days before the Abu Dhabi season finale that the 21-year-old will replace Yuki Tsunoda at Red Bull in 2026 as he enters into his sophomore season, while the Japanese driver is set to become a test and reserve driver for both Red Bull and Racing Bulls.

Reflecting back on how Hadjar performed in 2025, Mekies explained: “Isack has had an unbelievable first season. There is no doubt that in terms of starting point – so where he started in January – the starting point was outstanding.

“Then we are strong believers not only in the raw talent, but also the ability of the drivers to develop. We have seen so many champions developing through the years, doing things that they had not done in the car a few races before.

“We've seen that with Isack this year too. We've seen him making stuff in the car that he was not doing three races before.”

In terms of what his expectations are for Hadjar next season, the Red Bull Team Principal continued: “To answer your question, we expect – we would like him to continue onto that path. We don't see it as a landing point.

“We see it as another start for him to continue to develop, to continue to impress us, to continue to surprise us. And you will expect that in the second year. You will expect that in the third year, perhaps in the fourth year. So that's a little bit the journey for us together.”

“Comparing this year's broadcast ratings to prior years is a classic apples-to-oranges comparison and evidence of far-left bias,"" Roma Daravi, vp of public relations, said in a statement shared with The Hollywood Reporter.

	McKinley Franklin



	The Kennedy Center is defending the ratings performance for the 2025 Honors, hosted by Donald Trump, which saw the show reach an all-time viewership low. 


	“Comparing this year's broadcast ratings to prior years is a classic apples-to-oranges comparison and evidence of far-left bias,” Roma Daravi, vp of public relations for the Kennedy Center, said in a statement shared with The Hollywood Reporter. “The program performed extremely well across key demographics and platforms, despite industry and timing disadvantages, including a Tuesday air date two days before Christmas.”

					Trump-Hosted Kennedy Center Honors Ratings Drop to All-Time Low		
			









	On Tuesday, Nielsen Live + Same Day Panel + Big Data reported the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors averaged 4.1 million viewers, meaning this year's show dropped 26 percent in viewership year-on-year. However, since the 2024 honors, Nielsen shifted its methodology, launching its “Big Data + Panel” system that combines its traditional panel data with data from smart TVs and set-top boxes. 


	The 2024 show was broadcast on a Sunday with an NFL lead-in, the Kennedy Center outlined on background.


	“With overall television usage down roughly 20 percent year over year, the broadcast still tied for the #1 spot among adults aged 25–54, alongside a live NBA doubleheader,” Daravi continued. “And on social media, Honors garnered 1.5 billion impressions in just one night — up from only 50 million similar impressions last year. This was a successful night celebrating the outstanding achievements of our Honorees at the Trump Kennedy Center.”


	This year's ceremony was hosted by Trump and spotlighted Sylvester Stallone, Kiss, Gloria Gaynor, Michael Crawford and George Strait as honorees. The show was taped on Dec. 7, where Trump anticipated that the broadcast would draw in the best ratings yet. The president made a similar viewership prediction at an event filmed one day before the ceremony.

	











	“I believe — and I'm gonna make a prediction — this will be the highest-rated show that they've ever done, and they've gotten some pretty good ratings, but there's nothing like what's gonna happen tomorrow night,” Trump said. “We never had a president hosting the awards before. This is a first. I'm sure they'll give me great reviews, right? You know, they'll say, ‘He was horrible. He was terrible. It was a horrible situation.' No, we'll do fine. I've watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible, and some of these people, if I can't beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don't think I should be president.”

The battle between former colleagues Megyn Kelly and Mark Levin takes a nasty turn as conservative civil war intensifies. Levin calls Kelly a ""degenerate bigot."" Kelly brands the Fox anchor ""a bitter old man."" 


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Right-wing talking heads like Megyn Kelly and Mark Levin once reserved their sharpest slings for liberals, immigrants and Joe Biden. But suddenly they're dropping their biggest bombs on each other.


	Kelly, a former Fox News anchor and NBC host, has been engaged in an increasingly ugly social-media shootout with her former Fox News colleague Mark Levin, the longtime host of the syndicated The Mark Levin Show and star of Fox News' weekend staple Life, Liberty & Levin.




	The two veteran anchors have been feuding since a Turning Point USA convention in mid-December, when Ben Shapiro‘s keynote speech attacking right-wing conspiracists like Tucker Carlson triggered a mini meltdown in MAGA-world. After lashing out at Shapiro and seemingly aligning herself with Carlson, Candace Owens and Jack Posobiec, Kelly took heat from former friends and supporters who accused her of trading her credibility for clicks. But what began as a debate over principles and tactics has taken an increasingly personal turn in recent days, with Levin denouncing his former Fox colleague as a “degenerate” and “laughingstock,” and Kelly dismissing Levin as an “irrelevant, bitter man.”

	The bad blood between the former colleagues escalated on Tuesday when Levin's latest anti-Kelly screed appeared on X. “Meg Kelly, whose ratings were so bad on NBC she became a laughingstock, was canned for promoting blackface on Halloween,” Levin wrote, referencing Kelly's untimely departure from the Today show in 2018. “You see, she was always a degenerate bigot. This is why she's cool with Candace Owens and Jack Posobiec. This is why she slobbers over Qatarlson. She's part of the Woke Reich — the queen of the modern Klan.  More to come.”

	But Kelly claimed to be unfazed. “You're just upset bc I'm not afraid of you or your baseless slurs,” she quickly clapped back on her former Fox News colleague. “You're an old, irrelevant, bitter, angry man who could never make it in the Fox News primetime. We used to laugh at you there for your red-faced tantrums over … everything.”


	The growing ideological rifts within the MAGA movement burst into the open at AmericaFest, Turning Point USA's annual conference, when Ben Shapiro took to the stage and called out what he referred to as “grifters” in the conservative movement. “The conservative movement is in serious danger, from charlatans who claim to speak in the name of principle but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty, who offer nothing but bile and despair,” he said, in a speech that earned him a standing ovation from the crowd.


	Shapiro also rapped Kelly, along with Carlson and Steve Bannon, for their failure to renounce the conspiracy-minded podcaster Owens, who has repeatedly suggested, without evidence, that Charlie Kirk, Turning Point's late co-founder, was assassinated in September as part of a global conspiracy that may have involved the Israeli government, the FBI and Kirk's widow, Erika. (Owens responded to Shapiro's remarks by calling him “a midget” and blaming Jews for the slave trade. Kelly has claimed that critics like Shapiro and CBS News president Bari Weiss have been motivated by their support of Israel.)


	At Fox, where Kelly once served as a popular primetime anchor, the network's usually voluble anchors have stayed silent as their onetime colleagues battle it out. No Fox News personality, other than Levin, has mentioned the contretemps. “It's like crazy person versus crazy person. Who you gonna root for in that fight?” one longtime Fox News producer wryly tells The Hollywood Reporter. Fox News honchos are also not taking sides. Reps for the network did not respond to THR‘s request for comment.

Saweetie serves as the face of the juicy lip product.


													By
												

	Amina Ayoud



	All products and services featured are independently chosen by editors. However, Billboard may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.


	Ever wonder how Saweetie keeps her lips looking effortlessly shiny?


	When she's not selling out shows or climbing the Billboard charts with punchy and toe-tapping tracks, the “My Type” rapper is applying ultra-shiny lip gloss from NYX, a brand best known for its inventive, artistic makeup at price points worth celebrating. The gloss in question is a new launch for the brand, and one Saweetie serves as the face of.


	It's their Jelly Job Lip Gloss, retailing for $12, a deeply hydrating, ultra-pigmented gloss akin to formulas we've seen popularized in the '90s. When applied, the result is non-sticky, glassy and kissable lips that'll have you turning heads like Saweetie every time. It offers a sort of plumping, full-bodied effect, without all the drama and stinging pain of your usual plumping glosses. “It's juicy and makes the lips look like glass,” Saweetie said in an interview with ShopBillboard, giving her makeup secret weapon a glowing review. “Lips look rich, feel hydrated and stay scrumptious! Muaaaah!”

		A high-shine lip gloss in the shade Toast N' Jelly.	


	Scrumptious indeed. It's easy to see why Saweetie is obsessed with these glosses. The price point is excellent and the formula is unlike anything we've seen before, leaning towards a jelly-like consistency rather than the fluid and tacky lip glosses on the market today. Jelly Job comes in 16 shades, although the rapper seems to gravitate towards the color Toast N' Jelly, a pale nude.

	











	You've got versatile, clear hues like the shade Just Jelly that can be applied on top of your usual lip combo to bump up the shine, along with shades like Glow Job and Jelly Kiss'd with sparkling flecks suspended in the formula that give the lips even more dimension and sparkle. When asked about makeup pet peeves, Saweetie kept it simple, sticking to the gloss theme with a problem we can all relate to. “Lip gloss that bursts in purses!! Ughhh.” Rest assured, though, these glosses won't go spilling out on you, given that the applicator, a precise doe foot, is nestled into the unit, screwed shut with a clear decorative cap.




	To go along with her glossy lips, Saweetie spilled on some of her other NYX favorites that could get her stage-ready in a flash. “Gloss for shine, liner for drama and setting spray so it doesn't move a muscle.” Her liner of choice? NYX Lip Lingerie Lip Liner Stain in the shade Cuff Me for $12, another innovative product from the brand. Unlike your average liner, this style is a felt tip for extra precision. It's a stain rather than a waxy stick formula, making sure that your lip liner won't budge even if you're drinking, talking, or, in Saweetie's case, rapping into the mic.

		A setting spray with intense staying power to keep your makeup staying in place for hours.	


	The liner stain comes in 12 shades, with a range of both warm and cool toned hues great for whatever mood you're in. The felt tip is an ingenious addition that comes with a rounded tip, allowing users to carve out the lip shape they want with a flick of the wrist.


	To set her base, the “Icy Girl” rapper sets things in place with NYX's The Face Glue Setting Spray for $10. The spray is meant to emulate the look of a glue bottle like something straight out of your childhood. As the name suggests, the setting spray features a “grippy” finish that keeps your makeup pristine for hours upon hours of wear. The setting spray also gives your makeup a transfer-resistant finish, which means you won't have to worry about smudging your base on clothes or others, a specifically important detail for Saweetie while performing.


	You'll notice that all three of these products are meant for longevity and high-impact, a facet that is extremely important for stage makeup, as well as everyday makeup if you want your look to last long. If you follow in Saweetie's proverbial makeup footsteps with NYX in your kit, you're bound to come up with makeup that wows.

	Melanie C spiced up everyone's life as the British pop singer helped ring in 2026 Down Under with a Spice Girls medley.


	Australia is, of course, one of the first countries to welcome the New Year. And Sydney typically plays the role as global party starter with an all-star concert, the countdown and a striking fireworks display.


	For such a grand occasion, Melanie C (aka Sporty Spice) had a solid gameplan. “I thought it would be very rude of me to come all this way and not sing a Spice Girls song,” she told the crowd gathered for the ABC New Year's Eve 2025 Concert at the Sydney Opera House.

	She didn't disappoint, hitting a nine-minute-long showcase of “2 Become 1,” “You'll Be There,” “Spice Up Your Life,” and “Who Do You Think You Are?,” with a full backing band. Watch below.

	











	The Spice Girls — Posh, Scary, Sporty, Baby and Ginger — formed in 1994, and had a global phenomenon two years later with their debut single, 1996's “Wannabe.” The catchy track notched four weeks at the summit of the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1997, and is one of the group's nine U.K. No. 1 singles. Their debut album Spice reigned over the Billboard 200 (for five weeks) and Official U.K. Albums Chart (15 weeks), and followup Spiceworld led by U.K. list for three weeks in 1997.


	The group went on hiatus in 2000, returning in 2007 for a global tour and again in 2018-2019, though without Victoria Beckham (aka Posh).




	The fivesome reunited briefly in April 2024 at Beckham's 50th birthday party at the swanky London private club Oswald's, where they sang an impromptu mini-set of “Stop” and “Mama”. Prior to that, the last time all five members performed together was at the London 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.


	Melanie C has actually settled into life in the great southern land. She served as a coach on The Voice Australia in 2025 and she is regularly spotted out and about with her boyfriend Chris Dingwall, a Sydney model.


	According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, more than 4.6 million Aussies tuned into the NYE special, which also featured performances by Matt Corby, The Cat Empire, Peach PRC, Marcia Hines, Casey Donovan, Don West, Jem Cassar-Daley, Ayesha Madon and others.

The country hitmaker and his girlfriend reportedly tied the knot just before the new year.


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



Zach Bryan and Samantha Leonard have seemingly tied the knot, based on video footage uploaded on New Year's Eve (Wednesday, Dec. 31) that appears to show the couple in wedding attire, in a car announcing them as “just married.”


Billboard reached out to a representative for Bryan for comment. 

	











	Bryan's rep has not responded as of press time Wednesday evening, and the musician has not confirmed the wedding news himself on social media.


	But the video circulating online shows Bryan and Leonard in what looks to be newlywed mode, in a tux and bridal gown. In the clip — first posted by celebrity gossip account Deuxmoi on Instagram, before being picked up by media outlets including People — a sunglasses-wearing Bryan is seen carrying his apparent bride to a convertible, in which they drive off together down a cobblestone road. The vehicle is adorned with a “just married” banner.


	Furthering speculation, Bryan posted a photo on Instagram just a day prior that resembles a groomsmen group pose — captioned with lyrics from the Black Eyed Peas' “I Gotta Feeling.” The 2009 hit is a popular song choice for special occasions like weddings.


	“Tonight's the night, let's live it up (I feel)/ I got my money, let's spend it up/ Go out and smash it, like, ‘Oh my God!'/ Jump off that sofa, let's kick it off (I feel),” he wrote.

	











	The pair were first publicly spotted together in social media snapshots during summer 2025, but have remained mostly private about their relationship.


	The country hitmaker was previously married once, to Rose Madden, from 2020 to 2021. 


	Prior to Bryan's relationship with Leonard, he'd publicly dated podcaster Brianna LaPaglia; they split in 2024. Bryan and LaPaglia made headlines in the messy aftermath of the breakup, with LaPaglia accusing the musician of emotional abuse and the two trading back-and-forth barbs on social media.


	Bryan had the third-highest grossing country tour of 2025, according to Boxscore, with his Quittin' Time Tour grossing $159.6M and selling 941,000 tickets. He's shared plans to return to the road in 2026, citing “popular demand and some life changes as of late,” on a trek he's named With Heaven On Tour.


	His next album, With Heaven on Top, arrives Jan. 9. 


	It'll be the followup to 2024's The Great American Bar Scene, which spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart and reached No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. In 2024 Bryan became a Grammy winner for “I Remember Everything,” his Hot 100 No. 1 with Kacey Musgraves.

	If 2025 felt like a nightmare from start to finish, CBS delivered one final twist with a glitchy New Year's Eve Live: Nashville's Big Bash.


	The five-hour special featured some of the biggest names in country, from Jason Aldean to Dierks Bentley, Brooks & Dunn, Rascal Flatts, Keith Urban, Dwight Yoakam, Bailey Zimmerman, and a change in the schedule that no one saw coming.  


	The televised event Wednesday night, Dec. 31 went offline for roughly 12 minutes, according to various reports and scores of comments on social media, which the network covered by running an episode of Matlock.

	According to Variety, the interruption occurred about 50 minutes into the show, as Lainey Wilson was mid-song. A CBS studio voice attributed “technical difficulties,” the broadcast cut to commercials, and an episode of Matlock filled the dead air.

	











	When the CBS got its train back on the tracks, hosts Bert Kreischer and Hardy apologized, before “Redneck Woman” singer Gretchen Wilson took the stage.


	Social media has been unforgiving. “What the f— are you guys doing,” writes Ryder on X. “Trying to watch the Nashville Big Bash and it's jumping all over the place. Was watching Lainey Wilson perform and it froze then a news ad and then Matlock then back to ads. What the hell???”




	Another user with the handle Wild About Musik writes, “What a huge mess up!!!”.


	CBS has yet to issue a statement on the technical blunder, which beamed out from Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park.


New Year's Eve Live: Nashville's Big Bash was executive produced by Robert Deaton and Mary Hilliard Harrington in partnership with Music City Inc., the foundation of the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp. The special was directed by Sandra Restrepo, and aired from 8p.m.-10 p.m. ET/PT and 10:30 p.m.-1:30 a.m. ET/PT on CBS Television Network and streaming on Paramount+.


	As previously reported, the New Year's Eve Live: Nashville's Big Bash official, in-person watch party was held at Luke Combs' Category 10 in Nashville.

			By Melanie Goodfellow, Andreas Wiseman, Zac Ntim 


	Happy New Year! Goodbye 2025 and hello 2026. As the Deadline team catches its breath before hitting the global film festival circuit again later this month, here is our annual (non-exhaustive) list of U.S. and international movies we believe/hope will make the cut. As in our previous prediction lists, we've focused on titles that have already started filming or are in post-production and which haven't yet been announced for a festival.


	There's always great interest in which studio movies could grace Cannes, Venice and other A-list festivals. We hear movies unlikely to debut on the Croisette, despite their early summer launch dates, include Steven Spielberg's UFO film Disclosure Day (June 12 launch) and Disney/Pixar sequel Toy Story 5 (June 19). Christopher Nolan's red-hot epic The Odyssey (July 17) is surely opening as a stand-alone summer blockbuster, with the director eschewing festival launches for many years. And just imagine the studio costs associated with getting all that talent to the Riviera! That leaves Cannes potentially short-handed in terms of major studio launches. But Thierry Frémaux often works magic, so let's see. There will still be plenty of high-profile pictures to choose from, as our list below reveals.

	











	Looking to the fall festivals, Alejandro González Iñárritu's newly titled Digger, starring Tom Cruise, looks possible for Venice, while Dune: Part Three has been dated for December 18, so seems to be removed from festival contention. There's also a question mark over Netflix's anticipated The Adventures of Cliff Booth. David Fincher is reportedly still filming into January so he'd have to go some to be ready for a summer release (which was reported in one trade), but we hear that Venice or another fall fest isn't off the table. Netflix often has a healthy contingent on the Lido, and Fincher's last film (also for Netflix), The Killer, launched at the Italian jamboree, while two of his last five films debuted at the New York Film Festival. Tom Ford's starry drama Cry To Heaven is due to film into the early spring and hasn't set a studio partner yet so seems unlikely to be ready for a 2026 launch.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Check out our list below.


Paper Tiger


	Adam Driver, Miles Teller and Scarlett Johansson star in James Gray's New York-set crime drama about two brothers whose pursuit of the American Dream puts them on the wrong side of the Russian mafia. Expectations are high for a premiere in Cannes, where Gray has already debuted five features including last film Armageddon Time. Producer Rodrigo Teixeira proclaimed to Deadline in December that Paper Tiger is Gray's best film ever.


The Entertainment System is Down


	Ruben Östlund's new film is one of the most anticipated independent pictures of the year thanks to its high-profile ensemble cast and the Swedish director's Cannes Palme d'Or and Oscar nomination track record. The dark satire is set on a flight between England and Australia on which the entertainment system fails, forcing the passengers to keep themselves occupied over the course of the long-haul journey. The large ensemble cast features Kirsten Dunst, Daniel Brühl, Keanu Reeves, Nicholas Braun, Samantha Morton and Tobias Menzies.


A Girl's Story


	Judith Godrèche rocked the French cinema world in 2024 with sexual abuse accusations against directors Benoît Jacquot and Jacques Doillon, turbo-charging France's MeToo movement in the process. She is now gearing up to unveil her feature directorial debut adapted from Nobel laureate Annie Ernaux's autobiographical novel. Valérie Dréville, Tess Barthélémy, Maïwène Barthélémy and Anna Mouglalis lead the ensemble cast bringing Ernaux's flashbacks to life as she reminisces during a book-signing trip that triggers memories of the pivotal summer of 1958. Godrèche, who has been a regular guest in Cannes as an actress, hit the festival as a director in 2023 with short film Moi Aussi.


1949


	After a lengthy break, Oscar-winning Polish filmmaker Paweł Pawlikowski is back with this Cold War drama co-starring Hanns Zischler and Sandra Hüller as writer Thomas Mann and his daughter Erika, an actress, journalist and rally driver. Based on the 2021 novel The Magician by Colm Tóibín, the feature follows the Manns on a road trip they took across Germany in 1949 from Frankfurt in West Germany to Weimar, East Germany. Pawlikowski was last on the festival in 2018 with Cold War which played in competition in Cannes and was nominated for three Oscars.


Out of This World


	After Tahiti-set Pacification and bullfighting doc Afternoons of Solitude, Cannes and San Sebastian regular Albert Serra delves into geopolitics with this tale of an American delegation on a mission to Russia during the Ukrainian war. Riley Keough features in the cast alongside F. Murray Abraham, Evgeniya Gromova and Liza Yankovskaia.


The Adventures Of Cliff Booth


First revealed by Deadline in June, Netflix's film continues the story of Brad Pitt's character from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. David Fincher directs, with Quentin Tarantino's blessing and the latter's script. Also in the cast are Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Elizabeth Debicki, Carla Gugino and Scott Caan. What's not to like? The fall festivals would kill to have the movie. Netflix always has a healthy contingent on the Lido. Could this be part of the 2026 class?


Digger 


	Warner Bros and Legendary's new Tom Cruise movie directed by four-time Oscar winner Alejandro González Iñárritu has newly been titled Digger and will hit theaters on October 2, 2026 — that's the prized frame where Warner Bros/DC's Joker bowed in 2019 after world premiering in Venice. Expectations are high for the film described as “a comedy of catastrophic proportions.” Fall festivals are likely in the discussion at the moment.

	











The Unknown


	French director Arthur Harari drew widespread praise for Onoda: 10,000 Nights in the Jungle, which premiered in Cannes Un Certain Regard in 2021 and then shared the Best Original Screenplay Oscar with Justine Triet for Anatomy of a Fall in 2024. His third feature adapts his graphic novel The Case of David Zimmerman, co-written with brother Lucas Harari. The fantasy drama revolves around the titular David, a reclusive photographer who wakes up on New Year's Day to find himself in the body of a woman he clocked at a party the previous night. The cast features Léa Seydoux and Niels Schneider.


Gentle Monster


	Austrian director Marie Kreutzer won acclaim for historical drama Corsage, starring Vicky Krieps as Empress Elisabeth of Austria, or Sisi, which played in Un Certain Regard in 2022 and was then Austria's Oscar entry. Her new drama stars Léa Seydoux as a renowned pianist who relocates with her family to the countryside and then uncovers a life-shattering truth that forces her to confront the complexities of love and trust. The cast also features Jella Haase (Chantal in Fairyland), Laurence Rupp (Veni, Vidi, Vici) and Catherine Deneuve.


Misty Green (working title)


Rosalind Eleazar (Slow Horses) stars as talented actress Misty Green, who is attempting to re-set a career derailed by her vices in this original feature written and directed by Chris Rock. The stand-up and actor also appears in the role of film director Jordan, who offers Misty a role that would be perfect for her if it were not for their contentious past. The cast also features Adam Driver, Daniel Kaluuya and Anna Kendrick.


Parallel Tales


	Iranian director Asghar Farhadi returns to France for a second time after 2013 couple drama The Past. His new French-language drama gathers a high-profile ensemble cast topped by Isabelle Huppert, Virginie Efira, Vincent Cassel, Pierre Niney and Adam Bessa, with Catherine Deneuve also putting in a brief appearance. The film's storyline was being kept under wraps until Cassel revealed in an interview over the summer that it is inspired by the Paris 2015 terror attacks and that he plays a S.W.A.T officer. Farhadi, who won Oscars for his Iran-set features A Separation (2012) and The Salesman (2018,) vowed in 2024 that he would no longer make films at home until the country's Islamic Republic government lifts draconian rules around women's rights and attire.


Fjord


	Romanian director Cristian Mungiu's English-language debut co-stars Sebastian Stan (The Apprentice) and Renate Reinsve (Sentimental Value) as a Romanian and Norwegian couple whose plans for a new life in the wife's native fjord village come up against neighbors with a very different outlook on life. The film, which features some Romanian dialogue, also marks a first for Stan who was born in Romania but has never acted in his native language, having grown up in Austria and then the U.S. Mungiu has played in competition at Cannes four times, winning the Palme d'Or for 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days in 2007; Best Screenplay for Beyond The Hills in 2012; and Best Director for Graduation in 2016. He told Deadline in December that he is aiming for a Cannes berth once again.


At The Sea & Place To Be


	Hungarian director Kornél Mundruczó's Hollywood currency rose in 2020 with English-language debut Pieces of a Woman after Vanessa Kirby was Oscar-nominated for her performance. It remains to be seen whether Amy Adams will enjoy a similar trajectory as the star of his latest movie about a woman who takes refuge in her family's beach home after a major life setback. Mundruczó is set for a high-profile 2026 with a second film, Place to Be, starring Ellen Burstyn and Taika Waititi, also currently in post-production.

	











A Family Carice van Houten, Pieter Embrechts and rising young talents Celeste Holsheimer and Finn Vogels co-star in this intimate Dutch-language portrait of two siblings caught in the emotional crossfire of their parents' divorce, unfolding their story from mirrored perspectives as they navigate loyalty, heartbreak and the fragile path back to love. It is the second feature from Netherlands filmmaker Mees Peijnenburg, whose debut Paradise Drifters premiered at the 2020 Berlinale.


Wolfram


	Indigenous Australian filmmaker Warwick Thornton's new movie is billed as a period Western set on the 1930s colonial frontier. It follows three Aboriginal children who escape brutal servitude in the wolfram mines and embark on a dangerous journey across Central Australia in search of safety and a future they can call their own. Thornton won the Cannes Caméra d'Or for his first film Samson and Delilah in 2009 and was back at the festival in 2023 with The New Boy starring Cate Blanchett. 


Love Is Not the Answer


Juno and Superbad star Michael Cera makes his feature directorial debut with this absurdist comedy exploring modern loneliness and the search for connection. Pamela Anderson, Steve Coogan and Jamie Dornan star with further cast members including Lucas Hedges, Julia Best Warner and Shirley Henderson. Deadline is told it could be ready in time for a 2026 festival splash.


Deli Love


	A regular on the festival circuit with her short films which include Chopping Onions, Cheer Up Baby and Moving, New York-based filmmaker Adinah Dancyger taps into her Korean and Polish roots for this debut feature revolving around an unlikely bond forged between a Korean deli owner and a Polish-Jewish artist in her home city in the 1980s and continued against the odds across decades.


Love Lessons


	Fabrice Luchini, who won Best Actor in Venice for his performance in 2015 courtroom drama Courted, stars as a lonely retired literature teacher who reinvents his life in French writer-director Martin Provost's eighth movie. Other cast include Chiara Mastroianni, Emmanuelle Devos and Carole Bouquet. Provost, whose credits include Séraphine, The Midwife and How to Be a Good Wife, was last in Cannes in 2023 with artist biopic Bonnard, Pierre & Marthe.


A Long Winter


	Riding high on the reception for All of Us Strangers, Andrew Haigh has gathered one of his buzziest casts to date — featuring Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Bear), Caitriona Balfe (The Amateur), Fred Hechinger (Marty Supreme), Kit Connor (Warfare), and D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai (Caught Stealing) — for this mountain-set tale of a family preparing for a long winter ahead, against a backdrop of absence and regret. Adapted from the eponymous novella by Colm Tóibín (Brooklyn, Return to Montauk), the drama began filming last October and hopes are high that it will be ready for a 2026 festival splash.


Les Misérables


	France's Fred Cavayé has promised an action-skewed revisiting of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables with his French-language adaptation of the 1862 classic novel.

Victoria Luengo (The Room Next Door) plays the daughter, with other cast members including Raúl Arévalo (Pain and Glory) and Marina Foïs, who starred in the Sorogoyen's 2022 Goya Best Film breakout The Beasts (As Bestas). In between times, the director made TV drama The New Years.

	











Four Seasons in Java


	Indonesia director Kamila Andini's sixth feature revolves around a woman who returns home after spending more than a decade in prison for killing the man who raped her. Finding herself unwelcome and marginalized, she unites with other outcasts as she reconciles with her past and carves out a new life. Andini has shown nearly all her films at the Berlinale, with her last feature Before, Now & Then premiering in competition in 2022. In between times, she made the award-winning Netflix show Cigarette Girl.


Jia Zhangke Untitled Project


	Speaking with Deadline's Asia correspondent Liz Shackleton at the Pingyao Film Festival in September, Chinese auteur Jia Zhangke revealed he had written a screenplay for “a road movie without cars” following a journey across China. He did not divulge further details but said he aimed to begin shooting in December 2025.

FleurFrench animation director Rémi Chayé's last film Calamity, a Childhood of Martha Jane Cannary won Best Film at the Annecy International Animation Festival in 2020. With animation increasingly getting a splash in mainstream festivals, we've including his third animated feature in our list. Set in the beginning of the 20th Century, the work revolves around the fortunes of titular Fleur, a young girl who rebels against her life in a slum on the outskirts of Paris and seeks out the bright lights of the Belle Epoque capital. 


Yellow Letters Deadline's Baz Bamigboye reported in July 2024 that Ilker Çatak had wrapped production on his next feature, Yellow Letters. Çatak shot the film in secret and has been in post-production since then and is expected to hit the festival circuit this year The film follows a married actress and a professor of dramatic arts at the university in Ankara, whose lives are sent into a tailspin when they both lose their jobs due to “state arbitrariness”.


InkHot on the heels of 28 Years Later, Danny Boyle delves into the events surrounding Rupert Murdoch's acquisition of UK newspaper The Sun in 1969 and drive to make the then failing broadsheet into one of the country's most read newspapers. He directs from James Graham's adaptation of his Tony-nominated play of the same name. Guy Pearce plays Murdoch opposite Jack O'Connell as so-called tabloid king Albert “Larry” Lamb, the Yorkshire native hired to spearhead the newspaper's transformation. Boyle has debuted multiple films at festivals but not all.

	











Bitter ChristmasAfter winning the Golden Lion in Venice with The Room Next Door, legendary Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar got straight back to work with Bitter Christmas, a film about a woman who is abandoned by her partner during Christmas time. Almodovar reunites with Milena Smit and Rossy de Palma on the film, which is the Spanish giant's 25th feature project. The film is set for a March 20 launch in Spain, so could play Berlin and would be a significant coup for Berlin head Tricia Tuttle, although the Spanish release does not exclude it from a Cannes release.


CowardSet in World War One, Belgian filmmaker Lukas Dhont's latest feature follows soldiers trying to keep up their morale in the trenches. Stirred by wartime rhetoric, each of them seeks their own path. The film is currently set for a May 2026 release in the filmmaker's home country, so a Cannes debut is theoretically on the cards. Dhont was last at the festival in 2022 with Close, which debuted in competition and was then Oscar nominated as Belgium's entry that year.


De Gaulle: Tilting Iron & De Gaulle: The Sovereign Edge Diplomat-turned-director Antonin Baudry revisits decisive episodes of World War II through the eyes of General Charles de Gaulle. Simon Abkarian plays de Gaulle and is joined by an ensemble that includes Benoît Magimel, Mathieu Kassovitz, Niels Schneider and Karim Leklou, Florian Lesieur and Anamaria Vartolomei. Dated for release in France on June 10 and July 3, 2026, we would not be surprised to see at least the first part play Out of Competition in Cannes. Pathé released a teaser in late December which promises a polished, high-octane movie.


All of a Sudden Japanese Oscar-winning director Ryusuke Hamaguchi followed in the footsteps of compatriots Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Hirokazu Kore-eda to shoot his latest picture in Paris, with some scenes shot in Kyoto. French-Belgian actress Virginie Efira stars opposite and Japanese actress Tao Okamoto in the tale of the bond between a Japanese theater director and the French head of a nursing home. The drama is loosely based on published letters written by late philosopher Makiko Miyano in the wake of her diagnosis with breast cancer.


It Will Happen Tonight Louis Garrel and Jasmine Trinca co-star in Italian director Nanni Moretti's romance unfolding in Rome, Turin, San Sebastian among other locations. The film is adapted from short story Hungry Heart by Israeli author Eshkol Nevo, whose work previously inspired Moretti's 2021 film Three Floors Up. Cannes would be an obvious berth for Moretti, who has debuted 11 films at the festival, beginning with Ecce Bombo in 1978, and including Dear Diary, for which he won best director in 1993, and Palme d'Or-winning The Son's Room in 2001.


Where To? After a series of award-winning shorts including Auschwitz on My Mind and Seven Minutes, Israeli director Assaf Machnes makes his feature debut with this timely Berlin-set drama about a series of encounters between a reserved 55-year-old Palestinian Uber driver and a young, outspoken Israeli, who keeps getting lost in the city.


The UprisingSet during the English Peasants' Revolt of 1381, Paul Greengrass' period drama stars Andrew Garfield as legendary labourer-turned-rebel leader Wat Tyler. Principal photography began in September 2025, with filming taking place across multiple Bavarian and Franconian locations, as well as at the newly established Penzing Studios in Munich. Garfield is joined in the cast by Jamie Bell and Thomasin McKenzie among others.

	











SoumsoumChadian director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun's new film unfolds in a village where a young woman named Kellou is troubled by haunting visions. Feeling different from everyone around her, her world shifts the day she meets outcast Aya.  As the villagers turn against their budding friendship, Kellou must stand up for Aya and face the hostility of her own people, while fighting to hold on to her freedom. Haroun is one of Africa's most feted directors with notable films including A Dry Season, A Screaming Man and Lingui.


Artificial Fresh from their collaboration on After the Hunt, Luca Guadagnino and Andrew Garfield have reunited on this comedy drama set in the world of artificial intelligence and reportedly inspired by the company OpenAI and the tumultuous few days 2023 in which founder and CEO Sam Altman was fired and then promptly rehired. Garfield is joined in the cast by Yura Borisov, Monica Barbaro, Jason Schwartzman, Cooper Hoffman, Ike Barinholtz, Cooper Koch, Billie Lourd, Zosia Mamet, and Chris O'Dowd among others.


Jesse Eisenberg Untitled MusicalJesse Eisenberg planted his flag as a serious director with 2024's A Real Pain, which won an Oscar after its Sundance debut. He returns to director's chair with this untitled musical project starring Julianne Moore and Paul Giamatti. A24 has picked up world rights on the project, which has largely been kept under wraps. We know nothing of its plot. However, production began in early 2025, so the film is theoretically prime for a 2026 debut. 


Sheep In The Box & Look Back Japanese Cannes regular Hirokazu Kore-eda has two potential festival titles in the works. Sheep in the Box is is set in the near future in which a couple adopts a state-of-the-art humanoid as their son, while Look Back is adapted from Tatsuki Fujimoto's eponymous bestselling manga about two girls pursuing their dreams of becoming manga artists. Kore-eda is a regular at Cannes with Monster, Broker, Like Father, Like Son and Palme d'Or winner Shoplifters, which went on to secure an Oscar nomination.


By Any MeansThe cast for Elegance Bratton's latest feature is ridiculously stacked. The ensemble includes Mark Wahlberg, Nicole Beharie (The Morning Show), Giancarlo Esposito (Captain America: Brave New World), Josh Lucas (Palm Royale), David Strathairn (The Luckiest Man in America), Ethan Embry (Scream 7), LisaGay Hamilton (The Dropout), and LaChanze (The Outsiders). The film's plot follows a notorious mafia hitman and a young Black FBI agent who team up to investigate the murders of civil rights leaders in 1966 Mississippi. By Any Means will be one of the hottest fall 2026 titles. 


EnemiesAmerican filmmaker Henry Dunham is in a prime position to hit the fall festivals for the first time with his debut feature.  The film began shooting in May 2025, so it will likely be in a strong position by the new year. The film also stars contemporary leading men Jeremy Allen White and Austin Butler. The film follows a relentless detective and an infamous contract killer who collide in a deadly game of cat and mouse.


I Play Rocky The tumultuous 1970s production of Sylvester Stallone's Rocky is getting the biopic treatment in I Play Rocky from Amazon MGM. The film stars Anthony Ippolito as a young Stallone. The film was deep in production in October 2025, according to Amazon, so it could be ready in time for a late fall festival debut. 

	











Last Days Following successful runs at the Royal Opera House in London and the LA Phil, the English-language opera Last Days has been adapted for the big screen by artist and filmmaker Matt Copson, who co-created the original opera with Oliver Leith. Inspired by Gus Van Sant's 2005 film of the same name and financed by Mubi, Spain's AF Films, and LUMA, with additional support from Nina Pictures and Artemis Rising Foundation, the film stars Agathe Rousselle (Titane) who also starred in the original opera production.


Full Phil France's maestro of the absurd Quentin Dupieux opened Cannes in 2024 with his film-within-a-film The Second Act. His latest feature co-stars Woody Harrelson as wealthy American industrialist Philip Doom who travels to Paris to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Kristen Stewart). The trip takes a strange turn thanks to French food, horror films and a stranger hotel employee. The cast also features Emma Mackey, Charlotte Le Bon, Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim.


WolvesInspired by Lebanon's real-life 2019 economic collapse, Rami Kodeih and Nora Mariana Salim's debut feature revolves around a young woman who decides to stage a bank heist when she  unable to withdraw her life's savings to pay for her sister's cancer treatment. The L.A.-based husband and wife team previously made waves with short films Alina and Maki & Zorro.


Orient AdagioAfter a high-profile 2025 for Palestinian cinema on the festival circuit thanks to films such as Palestine 36, All That's Left Of You and Once Upon A Time In Gaza, Maha Haj looks at another Palestinian reality through her third feature about a Palestinian filmmaker, born and raised in a refugee camp in Syria, who gets a residency in Paris to write his first feature. It's a dream come true, but the weight of events back home sends him into artistic paralysis. Haj is a regular on the festival circuit, with her first two films Personal Affairs and Mediterranean Fever both debuting in Cannes Un Certain Regard.


Behemoth!Tony Gilroy shot his first feature since 2017's The Bourne Legacy in 2025. Pedro Pascal leads a cast that also includes David Harbour, Eva Victor, and Olivia Wilde. Character details are under wraps, and the film's logline remains locked down for now, though Gilroy has shared in interviews that the story revolves around a cellist. Gilroy's star power alongside a strong cast will make this feature a hot title for festival curators. 


Wild Horse NineMartin McDonagh's long-gestating feature Wild Horse Nine began shooting in March 2025, making the project a likely candidate for the 2026 fall festivals. Venice is probably the most logical home for the film, considering McDonagh has debuted his last two films at the Italian festival. John Malkovich and Mark Ruffalo star alongside Sam Rockwell in the comedy-drama, which has been kept under wraps. 


Sweetsick A long shot, but still worth noting, Alice Birch began shooting Sweetsick, her debut feature as a director, in late 2025. The film stars Cate Blanchett and follows a mercurial woman (Blanchett) with a strange and piercing gift – the ability to see what others most intimately need, often at great personal cost – who sets out on a journey home.


Here Comes the FloodDenzel Washington, Robert Pattinson, and Daisy Edgar-Jones are starring in this Netflix heist film from Fernando Meirelles, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker behind The Two Popes and City Of God. Written by Simon Kinberg, the film is described as an unconventional heist flick about a bank guard, a teller, and a master thief in a deadly game of cons and double crosses.

	











Teenage Sex and Death at Camp MiasmaHannah Einbinder and Gillian Anderson star in this American horror from Jane Schoenbrun. The Plan B and Mubi co-pro follows a queer filmmaker who is hired to direct a new instalment of a slasher franchise. The director fixates on the prospect of casting the ‘final girl' from the original movie, and the two women descend into a frenzy of psychosexual mania.Jack of Spades The new film from Joel Coen shot in Scotland over the summer and features a high-profile cast including Josh O'Connor, Frances McDormand, Lesley Manville and Damian Lewis. Little has been revealed about the plot but the film is speculated to be a period mystery potentially set in the 1800s.Her Private Hell Nicolas Winding Refn's first film since Neon Demon in 2016 shot in Tokyo and Copenhagen with a cast including Sophie Thatcher, Charles Melton, Kristine Froseth, and Havana Rose Liu. Plot and character details have been kept under wraps but the filmmaker has strong ties to Cannes. Neon is repping rights and handling domestic distribution, which is another potential Cannes signpost.


Possible Love Burning and Secret Sunshine director Lee Chang-dong returns to directing after eight years. He reunites here with Jeon Do-yeon who won the Best Actress prize at Cannes for their film Secret Sunshine. The film follows the intertwined lives of two married couples leading completely opposite lives. As their worlds collide, fractures begin to appear in their daily existence. Netflix is behind the project so a fall festival is more likely than Cannes.


Bucking FastardWerner Herzog's latest stars Kate and Rooney Mara, Orlando Bloom and Domhnall Gleeson. Filming wrapped in April on the project that marks the first time the Mara sisters have appeared on screen together. The movie charts the story of Jean and Joan Holbrooke, “two sisters who are so close to each other that they speak in unison, love the same man, and have the same dreams. They even make the same slip of tongue in unison. In search of an imaginary land, the Orkneys – where true love is possible – they start digging a tunnel through an entire mountain range.”


Bad Lieutenant: Tokyo This sounds a blast. Neon is aboard for the Takashi Miike update of the Bad Lieutenant IP starring Shun Oguri (Godzilla v. Kong), Lily James (Pam and Tommy), and WWE star Liv Morgan. The U.S. – Japan co-pro has partners including Jeremy Thomas for Recorded Picture Company, Sam Pressman for Pressman Film, Naoaki Kitajima for Nippon TV and Misako Saka for OLM. Written by Daisuke Tengan (13 Assassins), the film will follow a corrupt gambler (Oguri) in the Metropolitan Police Force, who finds himself thrown into a tangled case after an enigmatic FBI agent (James) arrives in Tokyo to investigate the disappearance of a politician's daughter (Morgan). Meanwhile, a deviant killer operating in the yakuza underworld seems to be shadowing their moves. Feels very Cannes.


Perfect Girl Adeline Rudolph, Arden Cho, May Hong and Jeon Somi are among cast for this psychological thriller set against the competitive world of K-pop. Billed as Scream meets Black Swan, the film is based on a 2023 Black List script and centers on a brand-new K-Pop super group that's preparing to be launched to the world at a massive concert. A group of girls have trained for years for only four spots, and the final cut is only a week away. The competition is off the charts. But when a talented and mysterious new girl is introduced at the last minute, things start to get strange — girls are being hunted and attacked one by one.


AnimalsYet another Netflix charge. This crime-thriller directed by Ben Affleck stars Affleck alongside, Gillian Anderson, Kerry Washinton and Steven Yeun. Currently in post, the film's synopsis reads: “Desperate to pay their son's ransom, a mayoral candidate and his wife resort to extreme measures, revealing dark secrets they never intended to bring to light.”


La Más Dulce Laïla Marrakchi made waves on the festival circuit in 2013 with Casablanca-set female-focused family drama Rock The Casbah, which world premiered in Toronto. In between times, the Moroccan and French director segued into high-end TV dramas, taking credits on Marseille, The Bureau, The Eddy and L'Opera. She returns to cinema with a drama about two young Moroccan women who head to southern Spain for a season of strawberry picking, only to find themselves subject to abuse and harassment. Against the odds, they seek justice in the courts.Safe Exit Egyptian director Mohammed Hammad's contemporary drama takes its cue from the real-life killing of Egyptian Christians by ISIS in Libya in 2015. The film follows an introspective young man who is still coming to terms with the loss of his father in the massacre a decade later. Working as a security guard in downtown Cairo, his path crosses that of young Muslim woman. An unexpected friendship blossoms, offering a route to healing his trauma. Hammad previously made waves on the festival circuit with Withered Green which debuted in Locarno and won best director in Dubai in 2016.

It's a dream come true, but the weight of events back home sends him into artistic paralysis. Haj is a regular on the festival circuit, with her first two films Personal Affairs and Mediterranean Fever both debuting in Cannes Un Certain Regard.


Mimesis Tunisian director Kaouther Ben Hania is currently on the awards circuit with Gaza-set work The Voice of Hind Rajab, which took Venice by storm last September and is Tunisia's Oscar entry this year. In between times, Ben Hania somehow found time to shoot a new Tunisian drama. The long-gestated work revolves around a woman called Bouchra who was raised in a mausoleum dedicated to a mysterious saint.

SPOILER ALERT! This post contains details from the series finale of Stranger Things.


Stranger Things has officially come to an end after an emotional two-hour finale on New Year's Eve.


	It's been a decade in the making, and throughout the final season, creators Matt and Ross Duffer have sought to answer all the questions about the Upside Down and the supernatural horrors that have been plaguing Hawkins, Indiana, since November 6, 1983. The finale kicks off right where Episode 7, “The Bridge,” ended on a cliffhanger with the characters set to face Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) for one final battle.

	











	The plan was to attack him from all angles, inside his mind and also physically from inside the Abyss. The group runs into quite a few set backs but ultimately prevail, managing to defeat Vecna and the Mind Flayer. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	So, does everyone make it out alive?


	The short answer is: We think so. 


	As soon as the crew leaves the Upside Down, they are confronted by the military. Hopper (David Harbour) and Murray (Brett Gelman) have already set the timers on the detonators, so the whole bridge is going to come crashing down soon. 


	As they're getting apprehended, Mike (Finn Wolfhard) notices Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) is missing. He spots her standing just inside the gate to the Upside Down and tries to run to her but is held back by a soldier. El piggybacks Mike into her mind for an emotional goodbye as she explains that she needs to sacrifice herself in order for everyone else to be safe, otherwise the government will never stop their experiments.

	











	She forces Mike out of her void in the middle of his pleas for her to reconsider her choice, just as the bombs detonate and the Upside Down collapses.


	But wait — months later, we see Mike, Will (Noah Schnapp), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Max (Sadie Sink) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) graduate from high school. After graduation, they're finishing up a Dungeons and Dragons campaign when Mike tells his friends a theory he has about their mage (which is what he used to call Eleven), who just helped save them from defeat. He theorizes that she didn't actually sacrifice herself. As he's explaining his theory, the episode flashes back to the moment the Upside Down collapsed. 


	This time, it shows Eleven escape with the help of her sister Kali (Linnea Berthelsen), who uses her powers to play one last mind trick on everyone before she dies inside the Upside Down. She makes everyone think El is standing inside the gate, when in reality she's escaped into the tunnels and gotten away. The screen then cuts to El on a hike somewhere in a mountain range as Mike says he believes their mage stumbled upon a small, faraway town to hide in. 


	Catching on to Mike's implications about their friend, Max and the rest of the group are a bit skeptical, wondering how they might know if it's true. Mike says they'll never know for sure, but they can choose to believe like he does. They take turns vowing, “I believe” around the table. 


	So, if we take this at face value, then that means Eleven actually did make it out alive. It all depends on what you believe.


	Oh, and thankfully the Duffers also confirmed that Ted Wheeler (Joe Chrest) is alive and well. It was up in the air after the Demogorgon took him out inside his home in Volume 1. We'd since seen Karen Wheeler (Cara Buono), but we wondered whether the we'd get to lay eyes on Ted again.


	Despite some close calls during their face off with Vecna and the Mind Flayer for Steve (Joe Keery), Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Dustin, the rest of the main characters manage to survive as well.

	After 40 years, Chevy Chase wants to get the amigos back together.


	The 2x Golden Globe nominee recently admitted he'd like to reunite with his Three Amigos (1986) co-stars Steve Martin and Martin Short on their Hulu show Only Murders in the Building, which is heading into its sixth season.


	“Right now they're busy on TV making that ‘I only have murders in my building,'” he said during a recent appearance, according to People, as his wife corrected him and noted, “It's a very good show.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Chase added, “It's a good show. Yes, it's good, they're good, but they really are lacking me. That's where we gotta get going. … If you really want to have a movie with Steve and Marty, you have to have me.”

	











	The Saturday Night Live alum admitted: “I miss them, that's all I'm saying. I really miss them, they're great.”


	In 2022, Only Murders co-creator and executive producer John Hoffman told Deadline of Chase potentially guest-starring on the series. “There will be plans for many, many other amigos and otherwise and that's in process right now. It's very exciting,” he said.


	The show was renewed for Season 6 in October, with production moving from New York City to London.

I will be on show before he will.

chevy chase is funny.  all the nay sayers are the usual sanctimonious wet blankets.

Make this happen!!!

Do Short and Martin even like Chevy Chase? I've read that most people who've worked with him do not

Whether they like him or not, they're clearly not interested in bringing him on the show.

No, thank you.

I hear this in Steve Martin's drawn out parlance “Neeeooooo Thank Youuu” :)

	It's hard to overstate the impact of the first 24-hour music video channel on the world's teens. But after four decades, and with the advent of Instagram's direct fan connections, the endless variety of clips on YouTube and now the Pandora's Box of AI video, the world's flagship music channel has arguably become a victim of its own success. 


	As such, MTV today stopped showing a 24-hour feed of music videos in the UK after 38 years in rotation. MTV Music, MTV 80s, MTV 90s, Club MTV and MTV Live have all stopped broadcasting in the UK as well as Ireland, France, Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Australia and Brazil.

	










There are now officially zero MTV channels in the UK that play actual music. pic.twitter.com/bQDYiwqSc2


	They went out just as the original American 24/7 music video channel began, according to the BBC's Jono Reed: with the Buggles' sunny “Video Killed the Radio Star.”

	Not only is MTV ending some of its international music channels, which played music videos around the clock, but the main network is also canceling some of its long-running programming. Although it was a long time ago when the MTV flagship played actual music videos in the U.S., its programming in recent years has been reruns of the clip show Ridiculousness. MTV was heavily trolled for its round-the-clock programming of the long-running series.


	Earlier this year, sources told Deadline the show was ending its run after 14 years.


	In September, it was also reported that MTV had canceled Catfish: The TV Show after nine seasons on the air.

	











	All these changes are taking place amid its parent company reducing its workforce nearly three months after the close of the $8.4 billion merger of Paramount and Skydance.

The radio still plays music though.

HAHA not really

It would be funny it wasn't so sad :(

MTV also created so-called “Reality TV,” when it launched “The Real World.”

John Barbour's “Real People” in the 1970s was the first Reality TV program.

Allen Funt invented reality TV with the long-running CANDID CAMERA that started in 1948.

Which actually started out as a radio show called “Candid *Microphone*.”

AI Killed The Human Spirit

Well done, MTV, well done.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","How time became the secret ingredient of life in Daniel Lopatin's Marty Supreme score","https://www.avclub.com/daniel-lopatin-marty-supreme-interview","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 14:16:40 GMT","

Sam Rosenberg's monthly column CineMusic highlights newly released film scores, soundtracks, and the composers/curators behind them.

Despite being set in 1952 New York, Josh Safdie's Marty Supreme isn't your typical period piece film. The sports drama follows the trials and tribulations of Marty Mauser, a young and stubborn ping-pong maestro played by Timothée Chalamet, whose single-minded pursuit of greatness is soundtracked by a series of ‘80s needle drops and a riveting, cosmic score by Daniel Lopatin, best known by his stage name Oneohtrix Point Never. The movie marks the third collaboration between Lopatin and Safdie, but it might just be their most emotionally epic one yet.

Much like his OPN records and scores for Safdie's other pictures, 2017's Good Time and 2019's Uncut Gems, Lopatin's work on Marty Supreme draws heavily from the shimmering electronic sounds of ‘80s new wave. All the trademarks are there: propulsive percussion, operatic choirs, fluttery flutes, sci-fi/horror-adjacent synths and organs. The sonic anachronisms might catch people off-guard—the Peter Gabriel, Alphaville, and Public Image Ltd. needle drops certainly did for me—but it's a mostly effective (and definitely entertaining) method that captures the friction between Marty's eager ambition to be the best and the many existential, professional, and financial obstacles he's up against in doing so. 

Over Zoom, I spoke with Lopatin about his score, how Tears for Fears served as major inspiration, his longtime collaborative relationship with Josh Safdie, his favorite pieces from Marty Supreme, and his love for composer Thomas Newman. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 

Paste Magazine: To start, I would love to hear about how you first conceptualized the score. What were some of the inspirations? Correct me if I'm wrong, but you mentioned in the Q&A after a screening I attended that you were influenced by the Tangerine Dream score for Risky Business and the John Williams score for E.T.

Daniel Lopatin: Those were touchstones, but they didn't inspire the score initially. The real inspiration for the score was the script. The original ending in the script that was altered—and that you don't see in the film—has Marty Mauser at a Tears for Fears concert in ‘84 or ‘85 with his kids. There's some indication, at least from the way I interpreted reading the script, that he might be reflecting on how he arrived at that point in his life and that's what you've been watching on screen. 

The idea that the music runs concurrently with this memory interested me a lot, in the sense that when you're trying to do two things at once, it doesn't really work out that well. So, sometimes, things take a backseat. I kind of imagined Tears for Fears as an abstraction that takes on a life of its own in the form of a score in [Marty's] memories of his life. I gave myself artistic license to think of the score as an abstraction of this Tears for Fears concert. That really unlocked it for me. 

But the other thing that unlocked it for me was just sitting in my first spotting session with Josh [Safdie], closing my eyes for the second viewing, and listening to the sport of table tennis itself and linking that to Marty Mauser's essence in his buoyancy, his excitement, his aggression, his speed, and getting into sounds that have a formal register that speaks to the game itself. And then, beyond that, realizing that there's a lot of interesting mallet strikes in the ‘80s new wave music—they were so into sampling real, organic instruments, because it was the first time they could. So everything came together in this crazy cyclone of ideas that were really perfectly linked with one another in a way that made scoring it really fun and really easy.

I'm curious if there were any reservations about doing something that was a bit more anachronistic, or if that was kind of always the plan.

It was pretty much always the plan to have those needle drops. That opened the gates for the score to follow suit. It is really ‘80s, but there's also Laraaji playing zither and percussion. There's Weyes Blood singing. There's a 32-piece choir and an orchestra. There's flutes and saxophones and fretless bass. There's lots of different things. I think it's a little bit of a blend of wanting to work with a concept that I was speaking to earlier. You could say that we might have more reservations about doing things “the correct way” and honoring the period than we would have reservations about doing something the interesting way, which is how we did it. To me, it would be just another boring period piece. 

You've worked with Josh before on Good Time and Uncut Gems. How would you characterize your collaboration? What draws you to working with him? Were there any big differences in scoring this film versus the others or have the processes working on each film all been relatively similar?

Ten years is a long chunk of life. You don't really know what you don't know. When we met each other, we were Marty Mausers trying to teach each other about how we were defining music departments on films for ourselves. He had made a few and I had some experience scoring a couple, but we were both really ambitiously—and excitedly—looking to one another. It's like an art project: How are we going to define our working relationship and how are we gonna make something that is us? We didn't really know. We were just inventing this kind of language as we went. Time is the secret ingredient of life. That's where wisdom is located. You've just arrived at this moment and you don't even really know how you've gotten there while you've gotten there through time. I don't think I could sum it up in any way, but I think when you're in the soup with somebody artistically, in the foxhole working on projects together over a long period of time, you develop a shorthand. You get better at what you're trying to say. You learn a lot about how to deal with soundtrack or sound on a technical level. You learn a lot from mix engineers. You learn a lot from other films. You talk a lot. You fight a lot. You just go through life together. It's been one of the greatest gifts of my life to have a long-term artistic collaboration.    

Josh helped out with the score as well. What were his contributions?

He just can't help but get involved in all aspects of his film. That's what makes these films so wonderfully focused and unique at the same time. You're just like, “These are Josh Safdie pictures.” He's in there conducting, basically. He's wildly gesticulating, showing me where he wants to hit a beat. He's showing me with his body like a conductor what's up. He's very brave that way, actually. He has just a lot of courage and belief in his instincts. No matter how little or how much he knows about a particular musical challenge that we're facing, he finds a way to describe it to me, often with his arms.

Do you have a personal relationship to or philosophy around the themes explored in Marty Supreme? Did that shape the sound of the score at all?

I don't know how it shaped it, but it helped me understand the film and once you understand the film, I think you're just in a better psychological position to make good work. Anyone who has dealt with ideas around integrity in their line of work, or the idea of a calling or the idea of your vocation versus your calling or these types of ideas, I think they'll get something from this film. That's one of the subtextual things about this film. It's about artistic integrity, or integrity more broadly, but we're aware of artists, so I guess we're thinking about things that way. When do you stick your neck out? What are your principles? Where is the line? How do you negotiate work and art and life and all of those types of things? 

Also, just the idea of a young Jewish guy for whom his community doesn't really want much more than the next guy. That's something I understand. It's a factor of growing up in a largely immigrant background, where so much is at stake and so much is centered around the ideas of survival and in a way conformity. There's reasons for that conformity. There's good reasons for that conformity. But as often as young people find themselves at that point in life, why would we listen to a bunch of old people telling us what we should be? We want to be something new. We don't want to be something that's established. I'm bored with that idea and I want something else. That's what Marty Supreme's about. It's so easy for me to sink my teeth into this one. Something like Uncut Gems was a little bit more of an analytical approach, where this one was just a little more like, yeah, this is in my blood.

Is there a particular part of the score that you loved composing? Were there any scenes that were challenging to score? Or did it all flow once you nailed the concept?

It was all a blur and a flow. A summer-long blur and a flow. I loved working on this score. I don't know how to single out any of my little babies, although I think there's some cues that are pretty dazzling. I love “The Apple.” That's where you hear some of my John Williams affection, particularly in the second half [of the song]. But I also like “Force of Life.” I like the final cue there. Very proud of that one. And I like “I Love You, Tokyo,” which is, at its core, almost a very simple European melody that my dad would play all the time at home on piano. It was interesting to see how much of his musical language was passed down to me. I like that one, too.

One of the standout tracks from the score, to me, is “Holocaust Honey.”

That piece of music is our arrangement of a Constance Demby piece. She was a pretty incredible New Age composer. She worked primarily in the ‘70s and ‘80s, making these New Age records, but they were so much more than just New Age records. She was classically trained and had a love of baroque music, so the piece is an arrangement that we put together of one of her pieces. Primarily, the drivers of it are electronic and arpeggio and that organ. It's an interesting piece because, when it really starts ramping up, it's Marty and Kay (Gwyneth Paltrow) circling each other and sizing each other up for the sex scene. There's a kind of glorious pushing and pulling between these two elements in the score, the strings being Kay and the arpeggio being Marty. It's a cool piece. 

You also put out a great album this past year, Tranquilizer. Were you working on that while doing Marty Supreme, or did you get a chance to work on them with enough separation?

It was back to back. I started doing research on Marty towards the end of Tranquilizer. They were right up against each other, spring and summer. 

How do you manage separating your work as a film composer versus as a solo artist? I figure it's a slightly different experience, in the sense that you're making something for someone else as a composer and something for yourself as a solo artist, but I'm curious if there's any overlap between the two, in terms of your approach.

I think I borrowed some of the more logistical aspects of scoring films over to my own stuff because, without some self-imposed restrictions and deadlines, you can really get into this megalomaniacal state of mind with your own music—where it just goes on and on and you keep tinkering and you say, “Who is it for?” Maybe I've improved on that anyway, but I think knowing Marty was around the corner put the fire under my butt to be like, “You gotta set some really firm deadlines here and commit to some stuff.” I really love that about Tranquilizer, that there's this kind of incredible urgency to it. It was also just really fun to make and once I unlocked the process of Tranquilizer, it didn't feel like a job or anything. I think I probably would just tinker forever if I could. 

Everything for any project, whether it's for other people or for me, locks into place once I know why I'm making the thing, what the soul of the thing is. The “why” always has to do with the soul, and the soul is always this enigmatic thing that's about feeling and inner-purpose and a message and point of view. And without the point of view, I don't have anything and no deadline can help me. I got really, really lucky this year with Tranquilizer and Marty, because both projects were coming from that place. It's insanely hard work, but it's easy because you have a point of view. You have a reason for doing this stuff.      

Any film scores or composers you love that have inspired or influenced you in some way—not just with this project, but in general?

I talk a lot about Thomas Newman, because he was someone I had a vague awareness of but got really, really into last winter when I watched Angels in America for the first time. My girlfriend showed me Angels in America and I was basically sobbing for two days straight. I got obsessed with Thomas Newman after that. I know his brother David because we worked briefly together. I texted him, “Oh my gosh! Tell me everything.” And he's like, “All right, you gotta go check out the Desperately Seeking Susan score.” You gotta do this, you gotta do that. I got really, really into him. He's been a big influence over the last year or so. 

I think he's also an unheralded genius of film score. The way I like to put it about Thomas Newman is that no composer has singlehandedly nailed the vibe of wonder or curiosity or the gentle intrigue about what the hell is going on around you. I love that about his music. It's just intoxicating question marks everywhere. I think he's a kind of total genius. His brother David too, who doesn't get a lot of airtime in the conversations about great film composers. I like them. I like Carter Burwell, the longtime Coen Brothers composer. I like melody-forward composers who have something to say, who have a point of view, who can be gentle but can also be propulsive. I like composers who are playful and use clichés and quote things and homage things that are generally post-modern in their attitude.

Gisele Bündchen shared a new set of sweet, never-before-seen family photos on New Year's Eve 2025. In the first shot, she showed a beautiful sunset moment from her pregnancy with the baby she shares with her new husband, Jiu-Jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente.

In the third slide, also taken during the pregnancy, Valente smiles down at the supermodel's bump while sweetly cradling it. The 45-year-old also shared a tender moment feeding her new son with her dog nearby, and more snaps of her older children, Benjamin and Vivian, enjoying their new sibling.

In another heartwarming snap, Valente plays with the baby, whose name has not been disclosed, throwing him towards the sky while standing in the ocean.

The Brazilian beauty shared a message to her followers reflecting on the past year. She wrote, “As 2025 comes to an end, my heart is full. This year brought deep lessons and profound growth.”

Bündchen then alluded to the birth of her son, whose arrival People reported on February 5, saying a source had confirmed the news. The former Victoria's Secret Angel wrote, “Becoming a mother again reshaped everything – my time, my priorities, my heart.”

She continued, “I'm grateful for these sacred moments that changed me in ways words can't fully hold.”

The A-lister then looked ahead of 2026, writing, “Thank you 2025. I step into this new year with gratitude, love, and trust for what's next.” She concluded her message with a red heart, a praying hands emoji, and a sparkle.

The superstar has kept her relationship with Valente relatively private, and has not made any public comments on her late fall wedding to the athlete. On December 19, 2025, Page Six was the first outlet to break the news. The report says a source told the outlet the pair tied the knot in November 2025. 

The report also says the source told them of Valente, “He is thrilled they finally tied the knot after having a kid together.”

The fashion icon finalized her divorce from former Patriots quarterback Tom Brady back in 2022, People reported in October of that year.

Around November 23, 2025, the model was seen attending the Franca Fund Gala 2025 at the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar.

She wore a black gown and accessorized with statement earrings and a choker.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Andy Cohen Shares Poignant Photo After Wild New Year's Eve on Live TV","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/andy-cohen-anderson-cooper-cnn-nye/","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 16:51:28 GMT","

Andy Cohen rang in the new year as he has done every year since 2017—alongside his close friend Anderson Cooper as co-host of CNN's live New Year's Eve broadcast.

For New Year's Eve 2026, the Bravo host was in rare form as he chatted with guests and downed tequila shots while awaiting the countdown to the New Year. 

But while Cohen, 57, grew increasingly animated as the night went on, in the end, he closed things out by posting a poignant Instagram photo of him hugging Cooper as they stood on a platform in the middle of Times Square.

“Happy New Year ❤️,” Cohen captioned the photo.

Cohen and Cooper have been close friends for years. They both have kids around the same age and sometimes even vacation together, they shared during the CNN broadcast. Still, their personalities are very opposite, which is what can make watching them together so much fun.

The duo's love for one another was apparent in Cohen's sweet New Year's photo. Fans reacted in the comment section

“A friendship that anyone would love to have. Enjoy partying the night away!💕🥳” one fan wrote.

“I know you know, but you two are THE CUTEST❤️❤️,” another added.

TV host and political commentator S.E. Cupp also chimed in, writing, “YOU GUYS. Can't tell you how much joy you bring to new years. Truly, YOU are NYE now. Taken the mantel. Done. Won. Perfection. Everything.”

During the live CNN broadcast, Cooper tried to calm Cohen down as he began to talk politics late in the evening.

According to the New York Post, shortly after the ball drop, Cohen went off on outgoing NYC Mayor Eric Adams, and Cooper tried to cut him off—to no avail. Cohen accused Adams of having a “chaotic” and “horrible” four-year term and wished him to “go off in the sunset” to make way for incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani.

Cooper put his arm around Cohen in an attempt to calm him down as he issued his passionate rant, the Post noted. “No, no, no,” Cooper warned his pal.

Cohen previously found himself in hot water when he dissed former mayor Bill de Blasio during CNN's New Year's Eve 2022. He and Cooper were banned from drinking the following year on-air.

Cohen offered no apologies for his 2022 political rant. The morning after, he wrote on Instagram, “I was a hair over-served last night, but man did I have fun! I hope you did too. Happy New Year everybody.”

He later admitted on his Sirius XM show, “Andy Cohen Live”  that he regretted talking about Ryan Seacrest's rival New Year's Eve show.

“The only thing that I regret saying, the only thing is that I slammed the ABC broadcast, and I really like Ryan Seacrest, and he's a great guy,” Cohen said in January 2022.  “And I really regret saying that, and I was just stupid and drunk and feeling it.  …I felt bad about that. That is what I absolutely, that I really regret. I really do.”

Anderson's laughing, (giggling) was again, worth the watch!!🤣 Made my whole year!😂😂😂

However Andy is always very inappropriate.  I refuse to watch WWHL. Andy persona is dirty mouth and cool, but his home personality has gay overtones.be yourself all the time. Stay out of politics. Mandani. really????

“Dancing with the Stars” co-host Julianne Hough has a new gig that is reuniting her with one of her exes … well, kind of! Hough will be cohosting “Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest 2026.” She will be co-hosting with NFL star Rob Gronkowski. 

The pair will be in Las Vegas, Nevada, on December 31, to ring in the new year. As audiences get ready to watch the show, we are also taking a look at Hough's past relationships and her current relationship status. 

Hough is currently single. “It's all energy-based,” she told E! News in a December 26 interview about what she is looking for in a partner. “I don't really have a type. It's more connection, and that's it.”

She continued, “I'm always looking for love, whether it's in a romantic sense or friends. Always.”

In the interview, she also shared her excitement about co-hosting the New Year's Eve show. “What is more fun and screams celebration than Vegas?” she said. “It's incredible. The performances, the lineup—it's pretty spectacular.” She also discussed working with Gronkowski, saying, “I just said to him, ‘I feel like we should do some fun dance TikToks. I'm trying to get him on [DWTS]. That would be really fun.”

Hough has had several high-profile relationships, including with Seacrest. The former couple dated from 2010 until 2013. “I'm so lucky that I have a great relationship. I'm very blessed, and I don't take anything for granted,” she told Parade of her relationship with Seacrest in 2012. “I think if you alienate people and just focus on your work then it just becomes lonely and it's not fun anymore.”

Before Seacrest, she was engaged to Zack Wilson. At the time, she was 18. In an interview with Glamor, she reflected on the relationship, saying, “When I first came to L.A. … I was engaged to someone else, a guy I knew from Utah who had served a Mormon mission.” 

In 2008, she dated country music singer Chuck Wicks, and the couple even appeared on DWTS together. They danced together on Season 8 and were eliminated in Week 8. 

In 2013, Hough started dating former hockey player Brooks Laich. The couple married in 2017 but split in May 2020. “We have lovingly and carefully taken the time we have needed to arrive at our decision to separate,” they said in a joint statement to People. “We share an abundance of love and respect for one another and will continue to lead with our hearts from that place.” 

Hough has also been linked to other men, but she has never officially confirmed these relationships.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'American Idol' Runner-up Reflects on New Year's Eve Tragedy That Inspired His Heartbreaking Song","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/john-foster-friends-car-crash-anniversary-new-years-eve/","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 00:17:17 GMT","

“American Idol” season 23 runner-up John Foster is reflecting on the tragic deaths of his two friends, Caroline Gill and Maggie Dunn, who were both killed in a car crash on New Year's Eve in 2022. 

Foster shared photos of both Gill and Dunn on Instagram, honoring the third anniversary of their passing. His post also detailed how their deaths inspired him to release his most deeply personal song, “Tell That Angel I Love Her,” the same song he sang during his Idol finale.

Before “American Idol” runner-up John Foster takes the stage at the 137th annual Rose Parade on New Year's Day in Pasadena, California, he took time out of his busy schedule to remember the tragic passing of his two friends, Caroline Gill and Maggie Dunn.

Sharing photos of Gill and Dunn, and a handwritten letter from Dunn, who praised his singing skills, his lengthy caption read: “As I get ready for my Rose Parade performance tomorrow, there's a deep sadness in my heart.”

He continued, “Three years ago, we tragically lost two beautiful souls, Caroline Gill and Maggie Dunn. That pain and heartbreak allowed me to channel the most beautiful—and yet most terrible—thing I've ever created: the song “Tell That Angel I Love Her.”

Foster then reflected on how the song showed him how music could have such a powerful impact on those grieving, while also personally changing him.

“This song taught me just how much music can mean to a community, to a grieving family, and how deeply it could change me as well. I'm still so grateful that God allowed me to be a vessel for His words through that song, and it has been a true blessing to see how many grieving hearts have found comfort in it.”

He ended his caption asking his fans to say a prayer for Gill and Dunn.

According to Parade, both Gill and Dunn were killed in a car crash on New Year's Eve in 2022 when an Addis, Louisiana, police officer ran a red light during a high-speed pursuit and struck their vehicle. Dunn's brother was also in the car at the time but survived the crash.

For viewers who watched Foster on season 23, he first performed the deeply personal track during “Songs of Faith” week, a three-hour episode that aired on Easter Sunday, April 20. While all of the Top 20 contestants delivered heartfelt performances, Foster's emotional original song stood out as one of the most moving moments of the night.

Foster ended his performance of “Tell That Angel I Love Her” by tearfully sharing, “I love you, Maggie.”

The three Idol judges praised his performance, with Luke Bryan sharing, “You've kind of been a wild card for me the whole time, but what you just did there removed all doubts in my mind that you deserve to be there … You certainly gained a fan in me tonight.”

After his critiques, Foster told host Ryan Seacreast that the song was dedicated to Dunn and Gill, with Dunn's mother in the audience to watch the touching performance.

Foster would later sing “Tell That Angel I Love Her” during the season 23 finale. While he ultimately lost out to Jamal Roberts, his song left a lasting impression on viewers and remained one of the most talked-about performances of the season.

To me, John Foster is a complete & total masterpiece this Earth will never deserve! His new song named “A Little Goes A Long Way” couldn't be anymore awesome! I can't wait for whatever is next from him! God bless him always! Holly in east TN (a girl who will never have enough of him)

[Editor's note: The following review contains spoilers for the “Stranger Things” finale — Season 5, Episode 8, “The Rightside Up” — including the ending.]

“We're not afraid of you,” a white-eyed yet clear-sighted Will (Noah Schnapp) says during the “Stranger Things” finale's climactic battle. Formally, he's addressing Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower), the little boy who grew up to be the big monster that brought so much fear and pain to the families of Hawkins, Indiana. But Will may as well be speaking on behalf of any character in a coming-of-age story. That's their goal, after all: to leave the relatively comfortable confines of childhood and embrace their uncertain, oft-terrifying future as adults. They're not afraid to grow up. Not anymore.

For all the talk around who would die and what was really going on with the Upside Down, growing up was always Matt and Ross Duffer's ultimate endgame. From the start, “Stranger Things” was a coming-of-age story. Even the adult leads, like Hopper (David Harbour), were struggling with some form of arrested development. They all needed to learn how to leave the past behind, while holding on to what mattered. 

 










So as the finale plays out beat by predictable beat — preparing for the decisive showdown (climb those ladders, kids!), suffering an unexpected, seemingly insurmountable setback (Hopper really should've known better than to fall for Vecna's tricks), then rallying to trounce the villain (with teamwork!) before returning home for a quick peek at where everyone ends up (Coach Steve!) — the familiarity doesn't turn stifling. That doesn't make it surprising — far from it — and the frustrations don't stop with getting exactly what's expected. But there's fulfillment to be found in a story resolving as it should, even if that means it lacks the edge to be remembered in the days, weeks, and years to come.

Let's start with what doesn't work. Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) being the only major death isn't a problem (although I'm sure it will be for viewers with a stronger bloodlust), but her arc in Season 5 is still an unforced error. To be honest, I didn't even remember who Kali was when she reappeared at the end of Episode 4 (“Sorcerer”), and even those who did likely weren't excited to see her. Then she's saddled with the noxious task of trying to convince Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) to kill herself for the greater good, only to reverse course at the last second and save her?

 










It didn't have to go down like this. Why bring back a character inextricably tied to a shunned plot line, only to kill her off? Were her powers so unique another character couldn't have helped Eleven fake her own death? Was Kali so reviled that she had to be revived, slapped with a torturous backstory to fill in the gaps since she left, and then shot by a loathsome soldier? It's just not a good look, and worse yet, it's emotionally hollow (unless you count anger over a little brown girl being sacrificed in order to save a little white girl). 

Elsewhere, the finale lost its footing when Vecna meets his ultimate end. After toying with the idea that Henry was just the Mind Flayer's victim all along — poisoned by a mysterious rock he found after killing the scientist as a boy — Vecna rejects Will's pleas to switch sides and then promptly gets his ass kicked. This half-hearted nod to a tragic origin story feels like it's only included to make people who forked over hundreds of dollars to see the Broadway show feel better about their choices, but it's not where Episode 8 goes wonky. 

“Stranger Things” isn't averse to the F-word. Per the Reddit forums, Will said it back in Season 3, and various other characters have dropped a muted or bleeped “fuck” or two. But Joyce (Winona Ryder) walking up to Vecna's crucified body and quipping, “You fucked with the wrong family” still feels forced — and that's before she proceeds to hack away at his thick, vine-y neck until his head thumps to the ground. 

 










I get it. Vecna's death needed to be indisputable, especially when Eleven's death was merely a fake-out. But my god, man. That was just gruesome. Joyce may as well have curb-stomped Vecna, Derek Vinyard-style — it would've had the same appalling effect and lasted half as long. Without the quick cuts to all the past anguish Vecna caused everyone unlucky enough to observe Joyce's butchery, I would've assumed they were disgusted by her over-the-top attack. But hey, maybe that's just me — again, I'm not watching “Stranger Things” with Drowning Pool cued up, waiting for the bodies to start dropping.

If anything, I was waiting for the coda. Knowing (or assuming to know) “Stranger Things” wouldn't end in a bloodbath, what happens after the boss battle becomes the most compelling question. How much closure would each character get? What's in their immediate future, and would the series jump ahead to tell us, say, just how many kids Steve has, or whether Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Max (Sadie Sink) get married? Thankfully, “Stranger Things” abstained from getting too granular in its epilogue — sometimes it's better to imagine whether Jonathan's (Charlie Heaton) film dreams pan out (“The Consumer” sounds terrible, but most student films do), or if Rockin' Robin (Maya Hawke) has a future in radio. (For her sake, I hope she avoided media studies at Smith College.)  

 










The highlight, though, is Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and his valedictorian speech. Invoking lost childhoods to an in-world audience who just suffered through a giant “earthquake” and an ensuing military occupation as well as an at-home audience who just suffered through COVID and… an ensuing military occupation lent Dustin's speech just enough extra heft to overlook the intentionally imperfect analogy. “Stranger Things” is not part of the resistance, I'm sorry, we already discussed this, but that doesn't make what he says any less effective. (“When you get to know people who are different than you, you begin to learn more about yourself” is a good line.) And his general demeanor (aka Matarazzo's performance) struck the right chord between youthful rebellion and full-grown assertiveness. (It wasn't much of a “Belushi thing,” but I could believe John Hughes would've liked it well enough.) Dustin deserves his happy ending, and his closing speech certainly landed more on the side of “chaotic good” than bad.

From there, the older kids get all weepy on the roof of the radio station, and just when you think the flash-forwards are over, Mike (Finn Wolfhard) wraps up their last D&D game with a few more — including the big reveal about Eleven, who does NOT die, and instead finds a magical village overlooking two waterfalls to live out the rest of her days in peaceful solitude… 

 










OK, not really. No way. As much as I appreciated the “Stranger Things” finale's attempt to provide closure without going overboard, the only reasonable way to read Eleven's fate is a tease. Who does she know there? What does she do for work? How long until the sound of roaring waterfalls loses its white-noise allure? As for Mike, sure, he could just “accept” her choice, as Hopper suggests, and leave Eleven alone for the rest of his life… or he could go find her, which I assume he'll have to do when the Mind Flayer returns in whatever sequel Netflix cooks up in five years or so. Heck, if Mike told Hopper his theory, you know the sad dad would be on the next flight to Iceland! He only gave that advice because he thought Eleven was as dead as his real daughter! 

No, despite literally ending on Mike closing the door to his basement, the Duffer brothers leave the door wide open for future installments. That's a bit frustrating, but it's yet another aspect of the ending that aligned with expectations. “Stranger Things” was never a perfect show; it was a limited series, undone by its own popularity. In order to survive, the Duffers soon resolved their nostalgia-fest had to be bigger than it was bold. Bigger worlds, bigger battles, bigger emotions. That didn't always work out (see: Season 4 and most of Season 5), but it works well enough for an ending that encourages everyone to accept saying goodbye to the things they once loved.

 










When Mike sees Holly (Nell Fisher) take over his D&D table, his instinctual protectiveness, even jealousy, soon fades to pride. He's happy his little sister and her friends can enjoy the same game he did with Dustin, Will, Max, and Lucas. Rather than jump back in and start another quest, he's ready to let them have their turn. He's ready to move on. 

“Stranger Things” took its time getting there, but eventually, it had the courage to grow up. 

“Stranger Things” is available on Netflix.

	After a tumultuous year marked by a messy public breakup with BFFs podcaster Brianna “Chickenfry” LaPaglia and a tiff with Gavin Adcock, Zach Bryan is wrapping 2025 by tying the knot.


	On Wednesday, TMZ reported that the musician married his now-wife Samantha Leonard during a private ceremony in San Sebastian, Spain. While their engagement was not previously announced, Bryan shared a Instagram photo on Tuesday of himself and what seemed like his groomsmen captioned alongside the lyrics to “I Gotta Feeling” by the Black Eyed Peas. 


	A short video posted by the outlet appears to show Bryan carrying Leonard, both wearing sunglasses, to a convertible decked with “Just Married” bunting and the happy couple driving away. A rep for the artist did not immediately respond to a request for comment.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The news arrives just over a year after Bryan confirmed his split from LaPaglia in October 2024, about a year after taking their relationship public and ending his previous relationship with Deb Peifer in May 2023. His breakup with LaPaglia soon took the internet by storm amid intense fan scrutiny online and during a BFFs episode, the podcaster accused the country singer of emotional abuse and alleged that he offered her $12 million to sign a non disclosure agreement. (Bryan has yet to comment directly on the accusations.)

	











	Earlier this year, the singer was also involved in an altercation with Georgia country singer Gavin Adcock after Bryan scaled a fence at the Born & Raised Festival to confront Adcock.

	











	In November, Bryan shared a candid update on his life and mental health, revealing that he'd been experiencing “earth-shattering panic attacks” and anxiety. To address these problems, Bryan said he stopped drinking and started going to therapy.

	“I feel great, I feel content, I feel whole,” he wrote at the time. “There is nothing to get me by anymore,” he continued. “If you or any of your friends are too tough, too scared, or too stubborn to reach out, know that the most stubborn dumbass on the planet did and didn't regret it.”


	Now, the newly married Bryan will kick off the first leg of the With Heaven On Tour in March. The trek will be the musician's first proper tour since his extensive 2024 Quittin' Time run.

	There are great songs throughout the history of pop music, including Bob Dylan's “Visions of Johanna” and Leonard Cohen's “Hallelujah,” where the imagery is so rich and dense that fans and critics have spent decades trying to decipher their true meanings. And then there's Taylor Swift‘s “Wood” where she compares a certain part of Travis Kelce's anatomy to a redwood tree and there's no other possible way to interpret it.


	That made it one of the most polarizing songs of the 2025. And with just 10 minutes left in the year, Anderson Cooper attempted to get through a dramatic reading of the lyrics while a very tipsy Andy Cohen did his best to maintain a straight face. “Forgive me, it sounds cocky,” Cooper reads, as if coming across these words for the very first time. “He ah-matized me and opened my еyes.” The next part gave him a bit of pause, but Cohen urged him to keep going. “Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see/His love was thе key that opened my thighs.” That last word clearly left Cooper a bit stunned, but he soldiered on, “Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet, mm,” he read. “To know…”

	











	If Cooper kept going, he would have read “a hard rock is on the way,” but he was simply unable to do it as millions of Americans looked on from their homes. He instead squealed with giggles like a small child, did his best to maintain his composure, repeated “I get it” a couple of times, and moved on with the evening. Cohen, meanwhile, couldn't remove a satisfied smirk from his face. From his perspective, this couldn't have gone better.

	











	In an interview with Jimmy Fallon, Swift insisted that the song was originally quite different. “I brought this into the studio and I was like, ‘I wanna do sort of like a throwback kind of timeless-sounding song,'” she said. “And I had this idea about, ‘I ain't gotta knock on wood,' and I would knock on wood and it would be all these superstitions. And it really started out in a very innocent place…I don't know what happened, man. I got in there, we started vibing and I don't know, I don't know how we got here. But I love the song so much.”

	On New Heights, a podcast hosted by Travis Kielce and his brother Jason Kielce, the song naturally came up. “Do you feel cocky about the song?” Jason asked his brother. “No,” Travis replied. “Any song that references me is a very…I love that girl.” Jason pointed out that the song referenced his “appendage,” but Travis feigned confusion. “What?” he said. “I think you're not understanding the song.”

	He understood perfectly well. The same goes for Cooper, Cohen, and just about everyone else on the planet who listened to it even a single time. The sole exception may be Andrea Swift, who simply wouldn't allow herself to process lyrics that concerned her daughter and future son-in-law engaging in intimate relations.


	“I think that she thinks that that song is about superstitions, popular superstitions, which, which it absolutely is,” Taylor said on SiriusXM. “That's the joy of the double entendre. That song, you could read that song for people and it just goes right over their head. That song…you see in that song what you wanna see in that song.”

	The Democratic party has had a vise-like grip on New York's 12th Congressional District — which spans the width of Manhattan from the top of Central Park to Union Square — for more than a century. Over his own three decade career representing the district in Congress, retiring Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) was never elected with anything less than 75 percent of the vote. Come November, the district is almost certain to remain in the party's control — but who clinches it could say quite a lot about the direction the party is heading in 2026 and beyond.


	Nadler, 78, announced his retirement in September roughly one month after a 26-year-old constituent declared his intention to primary the congressman. Liam Elkind, a Rhodes scholar and co-founder of the nonprofit Invisible Hands, portrayed Nadler as an emblem of an aging, enfeebled Democratic party, full of geriatrics who stubbornly refuse to give up power before it's too late. “The Democratic Party is DYING. We're losing votes. Losing elections. Losing our democracy,” he said in his campaign launch video. 

	











	Nadler acknowledged the party's age issue when he announced his decision not to seek reelection, telling the New York Times, “Watching the Biden thing really said something about the necessity for generational change in the party, and I think I want to respect that.”


	A crush of political hopefuls are now queuing up for the chace to fill Nadler's seat: With half a year to go before the June primary, the field is crowded with activists, advocates, influencers, and local pols. The race will offer insight into a host of questions still hanging in the air after Democrats' humiliating defeat in 2024. How big is voters' appetite for change? How much influence will tech billionaire cash exert on the electorate? Does the Kennedy name still carry any sway in Democratic politics? How much is #resistance celebrity worth? And how instructive will Zohran Mamdani's recent victory be in this part of the city, where the incoming mayor's support was softer?

	One thing is clear: A current of frustration and disappointment with the Democratic Party runs through many of the candidates' campaign launch videos. Democrats have “lost the plot,” Jami Floyd, a former WNYC host who worked in the Clinton White House, says in hers. Lawyer and victims rights advocate Laura Dunn declares: “We deserve better than Democratic leaders who've been profiting off their position while you and I struggle to make ends meet… better than wishy-washy centrists who are allowing the roll back of our rights and liberties.” Cameron Kasky, a survivor of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida says, “We need leaders who aren't going to coddle their billionaire donors, who won't support a genocide, and who aren't going to settle for flaccid incrementalism.”


	The second person to declare his intention to run for the seat after Elkind was Micah Lasher, 44, who currently represents part of the district in the New York State Assembly. A former aide to Nadler, Lasher is considered as the heavy favorite to nab the outgoing congressman's endorsement and, if he gets it, the Democratic nomination. An operator active in New York politics since his teenage years, Lasher has already racked up the official backing of a profusion of local officials — and at least one former rival: Elkind threw his support behind the assemblymember when he bowed out of the race in December. 


	Lasher, though, will have a lot of competition, starting with Alex Bores, 35, his colleague in the state assembly, a former software engineer who has built a name for himself as a champion willing to stand up to an increasingly powerful artificial intelligence industry. Bores was the co-author of the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act, a landmark piece of legislation that will place new guardrails on large AI firms. For his temerity, a pro-AI PAC with $100 million at its disposal has declared its intention to spend lavishly against Bores — a campaign that it has already begun. If Bores pulls out a win in the primary, it will send a powerful message to national Democrats who have been reluctant to take a strong stance regulating the industry.

	Lasher and Bores — who both currently represent segments of the district in the state assembly — are the established politicians in the race. (A third local politician who was vying for Nadler's seat, City Councilman Erik Bottcher, dropped out of the race in late December, opting to seek a state senate seat instead.) 

	











	But voters eager for fresh blood will have no shortage of newcomers to choose from, including two social media stars minted in the Trump era: Jack Schlossberg, the 32-year-old grandson of John F. Kennedy who gained a following for his offbeat Instagram presence (which often skewers his cousin, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.) and George Conway, 62, the former Republican once married to Trump's 2016 campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway. 


	A lawyer who worked on the Clinton impeachment before he became an outspoken Trump critic, Conway's candidacy will test whether voters in this historically liberal district are willing cast their lots in with an anti-Trump crusader who still self-describes as a conservative. (“I want to conserve our democracy, I want to conserve our way of life, I want to conserve the rule of law,” Conway said in a recent interview. “These people who follow the orange Jesus are not conservatives — they're nihilists.”)


	A trio of well-known advocates have also thrown their hats in the ring: Kasky, Dunn, and Mathew Shurka. Shurka, 37, is a gay man who spent years in conversion therapy as a teenager before going on to become an outspoken champion of laws banning the practice. Kasky, 25, co-founded the gun violence prevention group March for Our Lives after his classmates were gunned down by a former student in Parkland. He is running on pledges to pass Medicare for All and end American funding for Israel's war on Gaza. ”The fight of my life is the fight against American manufactured violence everywhere,” Kasky says. “I do not understand how people can be horrified by the shootings in our high schools, but think that these children and adults being slaughtered in Gaza is any different. It's the same thing.”


	A survivor of sexual assault as a college student, Dunn, 40, became a lawyer with practice centered on Title IX claims — sex-based discrimination on college campuses — before, she says, Trump made it functionally impossible for victims to pursue such claims in his first term. Dunn was part of a group of advocates who worked to rewrite Title IX regulations during the Biden administration, but Biden delayed implementing them until it was too late. “Now there's legal battles around it, but I'm skeptical that we will revive them,” Dunn says. “I am very upset by the Democratic Party playing with sexual assault as a political football.”

	Rounding out the field is Alan Pardee, 58, a former managing director at Merill Lynch. 

	











	With three months to go before the April 2 filing deadline, the race is still wide open and there is still time for even more entrants, with their own visions for and grievances against the Democratic Party to step forward.

Interview | Pandemic Studio alums go deep into the making of the kooky adventure that rocked PS2 and Xbox


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The idea for Destroy All Humans emerged out of frustration at seeing months of hard work go to waste. Pandemic Studios' Australian team were devastated when Oddballs, a quirky co-operative game they were developing, was shelved by Microsoft for lacking edge. In response, they created something radically different that became an unexpected cult classic.

Destroy All Humans (hereafter referred to as DAH!) was released on PS2 and Xbox in the summer of 2005. Behind such a brash, attention-grabbing title lay a game with a puerile attitude and an abundance of personality. In a delightful twist that captured the imagination of players, they were tasked with becoming the bad guy, someone intent on conquering Earth rather than saving it.

""It was significant because of the angle on it,"" says animator Lachlan Creagh. ""It was a funny game – really offbeat and quite different to things that were around at the time. Grand Theft Auto came out just before we were really making Destroy All Humans and then the publishers all wanted to have stuff like that, that was dark and gritty.""

 




 




This feature originally appeared in Retro Gamer magazine #271. For more in-depth features and interviews on classic games delivered to your door or digital device, subscribe to Retro Gamer or buy an issue!

When given the chance, the small yet spirited Australian team consciously went against the grain. An offshoot of the original Pandemic, based in Los Angeles, their office was in Fortitude Valley, Brisbane.The first game they delivered was 2002's solid if uninspiring Army Men: RTS. Having proved their worth with existing intellectual property, they were keen to develop some of their own.

""After Oddballs didn't get picked up, we started brainstorming again. We had an email trail of like 60 or 70 games that we were pitching, including some joke ones,"" recalls designer Dan Teasdale. ""Someone pitched the idea of an alien invasion, but you were the alien. I remember very clearly, it was right before we were going to lunch at this teriyaki place, and we were constantly riffing on this idea. It just took off from there.""

Their excitement was a clear sign of the concept's potential, but early versions of DAH! bore little resemblance to the final game. The UFO was the primary focus as you flew around cities destroying buildings and gathering humans to feed to space beasts. The team were fascinated with the idea of these grotesque monsters that grew as they consumed people and could eventually be used to wreak havoc. Unfortunately, others were less keen.

""I do still miss space beasts,"" says Creagh. ""Memory would maybe have been a problem, but I think one of the excuses was that it didn't fit into the Roswell mythology of aliens. Whereas we all just wanted to be able to collect humans as meat, process them into giant space beasts and unleash them back onto the unwitting inhabitants of Earth! We loved that idea, and it was hard to let it go.""

Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more

 




It was a funny game – really offbeat and quite different to things that were around at the time. 

Another significant change reshaped DAH!, bringing its protagonist, Cryptosporidium-137, to the fore. Teasdale remembers concern from higher management, and publisher THQ, that the game's focus was too narrow.""Instead of being 80% UFO and 20% on foot, we basically flipped it,"" he says. ""That turned it into the game that it is. It's more GTA-style. It's more about exploring on foot and being closer to Crypto as a character, which is one of the reasons that people still talk about it.""

The chance to play as the idiosyncratic Crypto became one of DAH!'s biggest selling points. A belligerent, wise-cracking alien soldier, he's determined to take revenge on humanity after his predecessor, Cryptosporidium-136, is captured by the US army. All snarling disdain and hair-trigger temper, the impulsive Crypto is given orders by Orthopox, his superior officer, but doesn't always follow them.

""We wanted that dynamic where Crypto's a loose cannon and he's going to have to be reined in,"" explains Teasdale. ""Originally, we wanted him to sound British. We thought we could get some humor in there. Then there was a publisher push that was like, 'Hey, what if you have his voice more like Jack Nicholson?' There was a lot of doubt, but we put that in and it worked. The way we developed his character reflects that. His behaviour grew into that voice.""

Both named after causes of disease, Pox and Crypto are the game's two main characters. They are Furons, members of an advanced alien race from the planet Furon, whose defining features are grey skin, large heads, sharp teeth and an insatiable lust for power. But using atomic weapons with wild abandon has caused a damaging genetic mutation, leaving Furons without genitalia and unable to reproduce.

 




We wanted to collect humans as meat, process them into giant space beasts and unleash them back onto the unwitting inhabitants of Earth!

Cloning has proved unreliable, introducing more errors to their genetic code, so an infusion of pure Furon DNA, which can be found in human brain stems, is needed to save them from extinction. For the Furons to prosper, humans must be killed and Crypto is eager to do the honours. This bizarre premise propels the story forward. Sent down to Earth, Crypto's first port of call on this 'crummy planet' is Turnipseed Farm, where he mistakenly interrogates a cow before humans are alerted to his presence. This setting was a late addition to the game, as the team were readying a demo for E3, and set the tone so well that it became the opening level tutorial.

Drawing on a wealth of sci-fi classics and schlocky B-movies, Pandemic already had much of Crypto's path through America laid out for it. DAH!'s twenty-two missions are split across six different fictional locations – the remote Turnipseed Farm, rural Midwestern town Rockwell, Californian suburb Santa Modesta, industrial port Union Town, the secretive Area 42, and seat of power Capitol City.

""A lot of it was just hitting those archetypes of Fifties Americana. It was kind of written for us,"" says Teasdale. ""We've got to have the farmhands going crazy, the fair, suburbia, a secret military base. If you're taking over the world, you've got to take over Washington. The one that probably fit the least, but worked out, was the dock-style area (Union Town). That came from our prototype.""

 




I think the tone is also a product of it being built in Australia. We have a larrikin culture of trying to make other people laugh.

From the playful script to the eerily atmospheric Bernard Herrmann-style score, DAH! is packed full of genre-film references, satire, parody and pop-culture savvy.Throughout, a young Australian team enjoyed affectionately mocking American society, its omnipotent self-image and predictable cinematic tropes. They created a world where hidden conspiracies lurked beneath the shiny façade of big cars, fast food, drive-in movies, celebrity worship and tabloid media.

""In sci-fi, aliens aren't invading Sydney! It's America, and the rest of the world just doesn't exist,"" laughs Teasdale. ""Comedy in games is depressingly rare as time goes on. I think the tone is also a product of it being built in Australia. We have a larrikin culture of trying to make other people laugh.""

""Our struggle on the comedy side was just having faith in ourselves. You write a joke and then you have to hear it over and over again for the next two or three years. You're like, 'Is this even funny anymore?' I felt like I was in a fugue state every time I had to play the first five minutes of the game. Then you'd put it in front of someone else and they'd be cracking up.""

 




Although generally successful, the humor didn't always hit the mark. Often silly and immature, some jokes, especially those concerning Miss Rockwell, were uncomfortably crude and have aged poorly.It was notable that the 2020 remaster of DAH! included a self-aware disclaimer at the start, emphasising that the original game had been modernised, but the content remained the same.

Throughout his invasion, Crypto often favours blunt force, but mind control, speed and stealth are sometimes required to achieve his aims as Pandemic attempted to balance out the rampant destruction and make DAH! more rounded. There are no checkpoints within missions, so failure means starting over again, which isn't a problem until the game's final stages when the difficulty level notably increases.

For the most part, DAH! isn't particularly challenging, with simple goals and forgiving combat sequences. As Teasdale acknowledges, the team wanted to create a fun and memorable experience above all else. It was about the joy of being Crypto – the freedom to explore unique environments and cause random chaos. The ragdoll effect of the Havok physics engine made blowing up enemies or flinging radioactive cows around feel immensely satisfying.

 




It was like, 'Well, who's doing that? I guess I'm doing that.' 

With upgrades available as the story progresses, Crypto gains access to an entertaining array of weapons (the Zap-O-Matic, Anal Probe, Disintegrator Ray and Ion Detonator).His flying saucer boasts several more – the Death Ray, Abducto Beam, Quantum Deconstructor, and Sonic Boom – each serving different purposes. He also has a jetpack to travel over shorter distances and psychokinetic abilities to imitate human appearance, read minds or move objects. Overpowered as Crypto may be for some early missions, the sheer ingenuity and fun factor is worth it.

Lumbered with 'stone tools' compared to today's technology, Creagh recalls Pandemic's improvisational approach to cramming so many elements into the game. ""With a small team and a tight schedule, there'd be a bunch of things that would crop up and it was like, 'Well, who's doing that? I guess I'm doing that.' All the programmers had to be supremely capable. Eric Smolikowski was a bit of a genius for setting up the animation system.""

""When you're surrounded by people who are good at their jobs, there's no embitterment about anyone not pulling their weight, although there was one infamous funny guy who'd fall asleep through the day. When he was starting at the place, he was told that if you're the last one to leave, just turn the lights out. He flicked the switch on the servers!""

 




After overcoming so many obstacles to make it this far, E3 2004 was a major turning point. Putting together the demo, and seeing how it was received, crystallised the team's sense of what DAH! should be. It attracted serious attention and was nominated for Best Original Game in the Game Critics Awards.

Suddenly, the pressure was on to meet rising expectations. ""Going from four of us on a couch throwing around dumb ideas to walking into E3 and having a huge theatre recreated in the middle of South Hall with Crypto standing on top of it was like, 'Holy shit! What is going on? This is wild!' Seeing people excited about it and lining up to see the booth demo was incredible,"" says Teasdale.

Creagh, meanwhile, felt a mix of emotions. ""If you bombed at E3, your forecasted sales were screwed, so you had to do well. We survived that and generated a lot of interest because our game was different. Once we'd got past that, it was semi-relief, like, 'OK, it's on.' But it was also like, 'Oh, fuck, we've got to make the rest of this now.' Getting good feedback is like the point of no return.""

 




Getting good feedback is like the point of no return.

For the next year, the Australian team were overwhelmed with work as they battled to get DAH! out the door. Towards the end, extra staff had to be drafted in from LA.""It was brutal. It broke relationships. There were cases where it was too much. People just disappeared and we never saw them again. We were all in our 20s so we put our lives on hold for a year and broke ourselves making this game,"" says Teasdale.

""It's hard thinking about that sometimes. You're young with no attachments, and you're so invested in this thing that you just want to get it out. It comes down to this very existential thing of like, 'Why do we make games?' The reason I make games is because I want to make people happy and put joy into the world. If that's what we've done, then it wasn't for nothing.""

 




I want to make people happy and put joy into the world. If that's what we've done, then it wasn't for nothing.

DAH! certainly delivered in that respect. A short, fun and punchy game, the main story doesn't take long to finish, but players are encouraged to roam and complete additional challenges.There are brain stems to extract, probes to collect, rampages to carry out and internal thoughts to scan, revealing a wealth of subversive jokes. With the media's help, the government spin Crypto's destruction as freak accidents or the work of Communists.

Although Pandemic eschewed the dark realism of GTA, it did imitate its map style and alert system. As Crypto's activities draw more attention, he is pursued by escalating law enforcement agencies – the police, the army and the Majestic, a shadowy FBI-style organisation overseen by Silhouette, his ultimate adversary. DAH! ends with the Furons having conquered America as the rest of the world awaits, lining up the sequel.

The game received broadly positive reviews, averaging 76 on Metacritic for the Xbox, and sold more than one million copies in its first year. While it wasn't to everyone's tastes, with some complaints about frustrating stealth missions and the arbitrary restrictions of its open-world environment, its sheer boldness made a strong and lasting impression.

 




After leaving Pandemic, Teasdale enjoyed huge commercial success with Rock Band, but found that it's rare to provoke the same instinctive affection that Crypto's first adventure did. ""It landed in a way that I don't think we really expected. Every day I'm still seeing people resonating with it and loving it.""

Still living in Australia, Creagh has had similar experiences, demonstrating DAH!'s endurance and global reach. ""I have randomly bumped into people in the last couple of years who just adored the game. It somehow made such an impact on their lives. For a while, you felt like a bit of a worker termite completing it, but at least the days and nights you spent working late were time well spent.""

Take a trip down memory lane with us and look back on the best Xbox 360 games the console had to offer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","Aliens' technology could be giving them away. Here's how scientists are searching for it","https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/alien-technosignatures","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 08:33:00 GMT","





Govert Schilling

When comet 3I/ATLAS was discovered in July 2025, on a one-way interstellar journey through our Solar System, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb suggested it might be an alien spacecraft paying us a visit.

Back in 2017, he made similar claims about the very first known interstellar object, the asteroid 1I/‘Oumuamua.

In fact, despite their somewhat unusual properties, both celestial bodies appear to be completely natural, and most astronomers dismiss Loeb's speculative assertions.

But what if he was right? What if we really did find a piece of alien hardware?

“Proof of the existence of extra­terrestrial intelligence would be the most important discovery in human history,” says Andrew Siemion, principal investigator at the privately funded Breakthrough Listen programme.

And while Breakthrough Listen uses radio telescopes around the world to search for possible interstellar broadcasts – an approach known as SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) – astronomers are now thinking seriously about how to broaden the search by looking for ‘technosignatures', other telltale traces of alien technology.

Spaceships, for instance.

The idea isn't new. In his 1973 science-fiction novel Rendezvous with Rama, Arthur C Clarke described the discovery and subsequent exploration of a huge alien craft that happened to pass through our Solar System.

Five years earlier, in 2001: A Space Odyssey, Clarke and director Stanley Kubrick imagined how mysterious beings left huge monoliths behind in the Solar System to guide the slow progress of human evolution.

SETI pioneer Jill Tarter coined the term ‘techno­signatures' in 2007 to emphasise that there are multiple ways to search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

But while many people believe that UFOs (unidentified flying objects) and UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena) are proof of alien visits, no one has ever come up with undisputed evidence that ET has rung our doorbell.

Then again, evidence of alien technology might also be found in the distant Universe, and not just in the form of artificial radio messages.

In fact, any weird, inexplicable astronomical observation could potentially hint at the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence (though most astronomers like to warn: “It's never aliens”).

Jason Wright of Pennsylvania State University, for one, likes to keep an open mind. “Is it likely that we will ever discover technosignatures?”, he asks.

“I don't know, but I enjoy exploring the idea.”

In 1959, physicists Giuseppe Cocconi and Philip Morrison first suggested that radio telescopes could be used to eavesdrop on alien communications.

At the time, no one had a clear idea of how likely extraterrestrial life, let alone extraterrestrial intelligence, might be.

Today, things look very different. We now know that planets – including temperate, water-bearing worlds like Earth – are plentiful, and that the carbon-based building blocks of life are all over the place in the Universe.

It seems incredibly unlikely that life has only emerged once.

Using sensitive instruments such as the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers are now able to sniff out the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets in the hope of finding so-called biosignatures – molecules that hint at biological activity on an alien planet's surface.

So far, no convincing detections have been reported, although a team led by Cambridge astrophysicists has claimed the detection of dimethyl sulphide in the atmosphere of planet K2-18b.

The discovery of biosignatures may have to wait for future facilities like the European Extremely Large Telescope or NASA's proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory.

If biosignatures are already so hard to find, you might expect the search for technosignatures to be even harder.

After all, biosignatures are produced by each and every form of life – even single-celled organisms – while technosignatures require the emergence of intelligence and technology.

But in a 2022 paper, Wright and his colleagues argued that technosignatures (including radio transmissions) might actually be easier to detect.

For one thing, technosignatures could be more abundant, as one single technologically advanced civilisation might spread across multiple planets or even planetary systems.

Humanity itself is a case in point, albeit at a modest level: while our biosignatures can only be found on Earth, our hardware is scattered throughout the Solar System – and even beyond.

Moreover, artificial structures could outlive their makers.

Even if the intelligent aliens become extinct, their environmental impact, buildings, machines or self-replicating robots could remain detectable for a very long time.

For example, the Voyager space probes will still peacefully roam the Milky Way long after the Sun and Earth have gone.

Technosignatures – in particular, radio signals – can also be detected over much larger distances than biosignatures, which can only be found (if at all) within a few tens of lightyears.

And finally, according to Wright and his co-authors, technosignatures are much less ambiguous.

While molecules like oxygen, ozone, methane and even dimethyl sulphide can also be produced by non-biological processes (at least in principle), the discovery of a black monolith on the Moon, or a radio signal containing the first million decimals of pi, would be definitive proof of extraterrestrial intelligence.

One particular type of potential technosignature (other than alien radio transmissions) was described by visionary Princeton physicist Freeman Dyson back in 1960, just one year after the landmark paper by Cocconi and Morrison.

Long before infrared astronomy seriously took off, Dyson suggested searching for weird infrared stars.

These, he argued, could be huge artificial spheres, constructed by a highly advanced civilisation around their parent star, to collect as much energy as possible.

Physics dictates that the outer surface of such a sphere would emit infrared radiation.

The idea was first proposed by science-fiction writer Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel Star Maker, although the concept has subsequently become known as a Dyson sphere.

According to Wright, it's not very far-fetched. ""Collecting energy is probably a fundamental and universal trait of intelligent civilisations,"" he says.

Perhaps you don't need a complete sphere, but even a huge ring of energy-collecting solar panels would be detectable through its heat radiation, or because it might block some of its star's light.

In fact, when Tabetha Boyajian of Louisiana State University announced the discovery of the weird, irregular fluctuations in the light of ‘Tabby's Star' – the star KIC 8462852 – back in 2016, some researchers (including Wright) suggested that it might be surrounded by a partly completed Dyson sphere.

Similar suggestions have been made for other stars with hard-to-explain brightness variations or with larger-than-expected infrared excesses.

Although the behaviour of Tabby's Star still isn't fully understood, most now believe the brightness fluctuations are caused by an orbiting swarm of giant comets or the debris of a disrupted asteroid.

Apparently, technosignatures are not so unambiguous after all.

But Dyson spheres and other potential alien megastructures, as they are collectively called, are still very much on the radar of SETI researchers.

Obviously, it's hard to carry out a dedicated search for technosignatures as we don't know what we're looking for.

But according to Siemion, any anomalous astronomical object deserves special attention, as it might be our first encounter with alien technology.

For instance, when the first pulsar was discovered in 1967, it received the code name LGM-1, for Little Green Men.

Only later did it became clear that pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars.

Fast radio bursts, first discovered in 2007, have also been assigned to aliens, by (who else?) Avi Loeb.

""I won't exclude that we will find advanced life before we find micro-organisms,"" says Siemion.

Even the search for biosignatures could possibly lead to the detection of a technosignature, in the form of chemical pollution of an exoplanet's atmosphere by large-scale industrial activity on the surface.

Keeping ET in the back of your head is good for science too, according to a 2023 online paper by astronomers Beatrice Villarroel and Geoffrey Marcy.

""Many scientists quote the loss of ‘credibility' of a certain field – either among peers or funding agencies – when big claims of alien life are made to the media,"" they write.

""On the other hand, research activity is often stimulated by the possibility of discovering alien life, regardless of the outcome.""

Wright admits that the chance of success in the search for technosignatures strongly depends on how often life will result in technology – something we simply don't know.

At the 2024 Life in the Universe symposium in Cape Town, South Africa, eminent paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie of the Institute of Human Origins in Arizona was sceptical.

""If we ever find extraterrestrial life, it won't resemble homo sapiens in any way,"" he said.

South African archeologist Sarah Wurz voiced a similar concern.

""Our present-day technological capabilities are the result of countless evolutionary coincidences and accidents in the past,"" she told her audience.

Siemion, who co-organised the symposium, realises that anthropocentrism is a real problem in our thinking about SETI and extraterrestrial technology.

""Maybe we're indeed on a completely wrong track,"" he said, staring at his eye-catching, alien-green shoe laces, ""and there's no guarantee that we will ever find extraterrestrial intelligence. But, of course, that doesn't mean we're giving up.""

As for visiting alien spacecraft: even though there's no evidence that the first three interstellar objects to visit the Solar System are anything but natural bodies, the next one could be artificial.

That's why an international group of astronomers, led by James Davenport of the University of Washington and including Jason Wright, Andrew Siemion and The Sky at Night's own Chris Lintott, published a paper on how to look for telltale anomalies in the shape, colour and trajectory of the many interstellar objects that are expected to be found by the new Vera C Rubin Observatory in Chile.

Who knows, even comet 3I/ATLAS could be a hollow body harbouring an alien habitat.

""The presence of ‘normal' behaviour, such as natural cometary activity, or surface colours consistent with bare asteroids, should not deter our follow-up observations aimed at constraining technosignatures,"" the authors write. 

""As with all technosignature searches, if we only look once, we may simply miss an incredibly obvious transmission or signal.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","‘Supernatural's 100% RT Spin-Off on HBO Max Is Your Perfect Weekend Binge","https://collider.com/the-winchesters-supernatural-spin-off-hbo-max/","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 02:40:00 GMT","

If you're still a bit distraught that Supernatural has been axed from Netflix's roster and moved to Prime Video instead, then consider zipping over to yet another streamer for a quick break between binges. Yes, we all love Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles' adventures as Sam and Dean Winchester, but if you're looking for something familiar yet still hoping to mix it up a little, consider giving The Winchesters a try. If you're not ready to give up on the world of Supernatural quite yet, you're in good company. That was the same mindset of former Supernatural writer Robbie Thompson and even Jensen Ackles, who united after the flagship series ended to further expand this paranormal universe. Even better, the complete series can be streamed on HBO Max.

You may have heard of The Winchesters a few years ago, only for the buzz to fade about as quickly as it began. A spin-off from the flagship dark fantasy drama, this series takes place in an alternate universe from Sam and Dean's world in the early 1970s. That was a bit of a spoiler to those who watched the show live — and were trying to discern why the Winchester family timeline wasn't quite matching up with Supernatural — but if you can view the show as an alternate take on John Winchester (Drake Rodger) and Mary Campbell (Meg Donnelly) from the onset, you may enjoy it far better in the long run. Before they become the eponymous power couple, John and Mary meet in their hometown of Lawrence, Kansas, just as John returns from Vietnam and Mary takes to the streets to search for her missing father, Samuel Campbell (played by Tom Welling). Although they're not yet ""The Winchesters,"" they're clearly on their way to embracing that shared surname.

As John discovers the world of hunting for the first time, he and Mary grow closer as they form the ""Monster Club,"" their small band of like-minded paranormal warriors who battle the evils that continue to invade their Midwestern home. Alongside John and Mary is lore-expert Lata Desai (Nida Khurshid), longtime demon hunter Carlos Cervantez (Jojo Fleites), and their older advisor Ada Monroe (Demetria McKinney). Together, they tackle everything from terrifying werewolves that put Supernatural's best monsters to shame, vengeful pagan gods, frightening djinn, and even the return of Richard Speight Jr. as this world's greatest trickster, Loki. Plenty of the classical Supernatural tropes are still at play here, from the classic rock and the general dynamic between its leads (albeit with more romantic chemistry), to the familiar returning faces and the general premise, which strongly echoes Sam and Dean's quest in the show's first season. The expanded cast is certainly a positive for this show, which doesn't hit the road the same way Supernatural did.

Although a working knowledge of the original series is preferred on some level, The Winchesters invents its own lore and reinvents the wheel just enough that some of the history you think you remember from Supernatural becomes useless. Well, sort of. By the end of the short-lived series, The Winchesters serves as a coda to the controversial ending on the original show. While Jared Padalecki has gone on record praising ""Carry On"" as one of his favorite episodes, Jensen Ackles doesn't appear to have felt the same way. Instead, he returns for The Winchesters, acting as the narrator for the entire series and appearing on-screen as Dean on a few occasions. Either way, this dark fantasy horror is a quick binge that will no doubt hold Supernatural fans over between binges, and it's a fine companion piece that is, in some ways, vital to a better, more fulfilling ending for Dean Winchester.

Arguably, the strongest case for The Winchesters is that it allows us to finally see John and Mary the way they saw one another. On Supernatural, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Samantha Smith played the older versions of these characters, but we rarely ever saw them on screen together. Even with the younger versions seen in the show's fourth and fifth seasons, played by Matt Cohen and Amy Gumenick, we never fully got to see their romance blossom. Despite taking place in a parallel world, The Winchesters aims to rectify that. The show largely centers on John and Mary's similar searches for the truth about their respective fathers, opening the door to John's place as a legacy in the Men of Letters and Mary's expanded role as a leader of a team of hunters. But even as they uncover these important truths about their life and destiny, they grow closer and begin to fall in love – and it's here where the show finds its emotional anchor.

While Mary holds her family secrets close to the chest and John is still working through a broken engagement, The Winchesters puts these two through the fire as they battle monsters, demons, and other paranormal creatures alongside their friends. As they search more diligently for the truth about their fathers, their friendship naturally transforms into something far more intimate. While Supernatural once revealed that Cupid was responsible for putting John and Mary together to ensure Sam and Dean's birth, The Winchesters makes no such claims, instead providing an alternate tale where the pair can find happiness and family all on their own without the direct influence of otherworldly forces. Sure, the supernatural still brings them together, in a sense, but it's a happy accident that leads to, from what the title suggests, a long-time romance that may just give the Winchester family the ending that Sam and Dean always dreamed of.

The chemistry between Drake Rodger and Meg Donnelly is another major draw of the sequel/prequel/spin-off. Off-camera, Rodger and Donnelly are romantically involved, and while that doesn't have to be the case for actors playing characters in love with one another, it certainly helps. The pair feel as natural on the screen as their Supernatural predecessors, and when their professional partnership turns into something more romantic, audiences were overjoyed. Considering the show is called The Winchesters, it was bound to happen at some point, though for many it couldn't happen soon enough. Unfortunately, Rodger and Donnelly's on-screen chemistry wasn't enough to keep the show around on The CW.

First airing two years after the end of Supernatural, The Winchesters was meant to be an exciting return of the franchise to The CW. With Ackles leading the charge by returning as Dean Winchester, fans surely would tune in to make it as big as the flagship series, right? The sad truth is that Supernatural has never had great luck with spin-off projects, and The Winchesters was another attempt that was axed well before it's time. While some fans claim that the show's low ratings were the sole factor (with some citing the series' poor production as the final nail in the coffin), there's more to the story than that.

""With a massive network shift coupled with an industry strike…welp,"" Ackles wrote on X after the announcement was made, ""that's some unfortunate timing."" The CW had been sold in 2023, and that year's writer's strike didn't help either. It seems that the fates did not favor The Winchesters, after all, even after a solid finale that tied back directly to Supernatural. Though fans tried to save the show in the aftermath, nothing has come of it. Perhaps one day, if Supernatural were to return, maybe Sam and Dean would be willing to catch up with The Winchesters story in a single one-and-done multiversal crossover? Then again, that may just be wishful thinking.

The Winchesters is available for streaming on HBO Max.

Las Vegas is expected to welcome 2026 with light to moderate rain showers.

by Jane Davenport



LAS VEGAS (KSNV) — Chad Ollinger, a 41-year-old reality TV star known for his role on Discovery's ""Mystery at Blind Frog Ranch,"" is facing an open murder charge after allegedly killing his cellmate, Christopher Kelly, at the Clark County Detention Center. 

The incident occurred on December 26th, and Ollinger is set to face a competency hearing later in January. 

According to an arrest report, Ollinger claimed to have supernatural abilities that led him to believe Kelly was a pedophile despite having no proof. 

The arrest report quotes Ollinger saying, ""If I know something about somebody that's bad, I take care of it."" 

Ollinger continues by describing the killing as ""necessary"" and ""righteous."" 

The arrest report says Ollinger told officers he has been able to identify child predators in the past, and ""had a responsibility to identify child predators because he had his own children taken away from him.""



Officers found Kelly, 42, unresponsive in his cell with blunt force trauma injuries to his face. Ollinger allegedly admitted to strangling Kelly and smashing his head into a metal bedframe post.

Trial attorney Tre Lovell commented on the case, stating that a competency hearing was the right move. 

The hearing, set for January 21, will determine if Ollinger is competent to stand trial. 

Lovell says that if deemed incompetent but treatable, proceedings will be suspended for treatment. 

If found incompetent without the possibility of restoration, charges could be dismissed, potentially leading to a civil commitment process.

If found competent, the trial will proceed as normal. 

Ollinger, originally taken into custody on trespassing and larceny charges on October 27th, remained in detention after being identified as a fugitive from another state. 

In the arrest report, he expressed no remorse for the killing and stated he did not care if he spent the rest of his life in prison.

...

We have had a feeling for months that the Dallas Cowboys and Trevon Diggs were heading for an offseason separation, and now we've got it before Week 18.

With the Cowboys releasing the faded All-Pro, and him being swiftly picked up by the Green Bay Packers (because of course, right?), Dallas has moved on from what has become an increasingly problematic situation.

Diggs' play wasn't up to the necessary standard, and his off-field antics were problematic, too, with Trevon wanting to ditch the team plane ride home to instead remain in Washington after Week 17 to spend some Christmas there with friends and family.

Dallas said no. Diggs did it, anyway.

And here we are with No. 7 no longer a Cowboy.

But what really led to Dallas' decision to move on from Trevon?

And how about two conspiracy theories that are worth considering?

Head coach Brian Schottenheimer pulled back the curtain from his perspective on Wednesday.

“It was really a culmination of multiple factors, performance and other elements,"" Schottenheimer said. ""He's been an incredible player for this organization. I truly do like Trevon a lot. I wish him nothing but the best. I'm excited to see where he lands and watch him continue his career.”

It now gives the Cowboys a clean slate and to those who support the move, shows the importance of culture under Schottenheimer.

The coach wasn't willing to budge on Trevon's request, which reportedly happened after the game - in a way that does not fit protocol.

Schottenheimer revealed several other players asked to do the same thing during the week. Their requests were also denied.

And when you go against your boss's wishes, it never ends well. Maybe this was the final push Dallas needed to cut the cord.

Or, how about the two conspiracy theories from our own Mike Fisher?

Conspiracy Theory No. 1 from Fish: ""Maybe Diggs did this on purpose, creating a loud conflict while defying his boss' order - while also ""coincidentally'' hiring agent David Mulugheta (who just happens to also rep Tre's pal Micah Parsons) - with the intention of getting cut so he could join Micah in Green Bay?''

Conspiracy Theory No. 2 from Fish: ""(Via my pal Ross): What if Trevon represents Schotty's modern version of Jimmy Johnson's ""The Asthma-Field Kicker''? The ""culture''-craving coach makes a big show of firing a player ... WOW! (who was going to get cut in a few weeks, anyway)?''

MINSK, January 1. /TASS/. Belarus expects Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico to visit Minsk, according to a congratulatory message of the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko on the Day of the Formation of the Slovak Republic.

According to the press service of the head of Belarus, Lukashenko noted that he would be glad to see Fico on Belarusian soil to discuss strategic issues of interstate cooperation.

""I am confident that the restoration of a full-fledged mutual diplomatic presence, which will culminate in the opening of the embassy of the Republic of Belarus in Bratislava this year, will significantly expand opportunities for practical proposals in all areas, including trade, investment, industrial cooperation, scientific and technical cooperation, culture, education and sports,"" Lukashenko said.

He added that step by step Belarus and Slovakia are expanding the range of cooperation, restoring diplomatic presence in the capitals with the expectation of even more fruitful joint work on the development of political, trade, economic and humanitarian Belarusian-Slovak relations. In congratulating the prime minister, the president drew attention to the fact that the positive and benevolent nature of bilateral relations, especially in the face of external pressure and opposition, is a driving force for progressive ideas and joint projects.

Belarus closed its embassy in Slovakia in September 2023. Last September Slovakia's ambassador to Belarus said that Bratislava was restarting relations with Minsk after five years of stagnation. Belarus expects to open an embassy in Slovakia by September 2026.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Zohran Mamdani was sworn in as New York City's first Muslim mayor with his hand on a Koran as the clock ticked past midnight on Wednesday evening.

The ceremony was laden with symbolism.

As well as using Islam's holiest book, the self-proclaimed democratic socialist chose a disused gilded age subway station at Old City Hall as the setting to symbolise the city's ability to think big and as a nod to the workers who keep modern New York running.

“When Old City Hall Station first opened in 1904 – one of New York's 28 original subway stations – it was a physical monument to a city that dared to be both beautiful and build great things that would transform working people's lives,” Mr Mamdani said ahead of the ceremony.

The station was closed in 1945, its tiled arches, chandeliers and vaulted ceilings seen only by a handful of visitors each year.

New York law requires that a new mayor take over on Jan 1. It has become traditional to take the oath of office at midnight, before a bigger celebration later in the day.

Mr Mamdani will use three Korans throughout the day, including his grandfather's and one that dates back to the late 18th or early 19th century for the midnight ceremony, according to the New York Times.

It represents the end of an extraordinary journey for the 34-year-old politician. He upended the Democratic Party to win its nomination before overcoming a lack of name recognition to win the election in November with a populist manifesto that focused on affordability.

He campaigned to create universal child care, make public buses free and freeze rents on a million apartments.

His radical programme helped inspire a record-breaking turnout of more than two million voters. And his supporters propelled him to a near 10-point victory over Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic state governor running as an independent, and well ahead of Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate.

Many in his city of eight million people now hope he will govern as a disruptive mayor, taking on the entrenched interests that have sent costs spiralling.

Bankers and other high rollers in New York had raised concerns that his radical policies would force money away from the nation's financial capital but have since begun trying to find common ground.

Mr Mamdani showed his conciliatory side in November during a cordial meeting with Donald Trump at the White House. While on the campaign trail, he had described the president as a “despot” and a “fascist”, in person the two leaders agreed to work together to make New York affordable.

Psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert joins 'The Sunday Briefing' to discuss New York City's mental preparation for Zohran Mamdani to officially take office and how Americans can stick to their New Year's resolutions.

With nearly 9 million residents and the world's largest financial hub, New York City is about to test a progressive economic vision under Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.

Proposals such as free buses, city-owned grocery stores and rent freezes have already rattled Wall Street, prompting sharp criticism from Mamdani's critics. The clash underscores a widening divide between progressive ambitions for the city and the financial sector that has long powered its economy.

Affordability sits at the center of Mamdani's agenda as he prepares to run America's largest city. Here's a breakdown of how he plans to address it.

CONSERVATIVE STATES SEE LOWER INFLATION THAN LIBERAL ONES NATIONWIDE, WHITE HOUSE DATA SHOWS

Mamdani has committed to creating a ""network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit.""

""Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers. They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing,"" Mamdani has promised. 

The mayor of New York City has control over city-run programs, so he can accomplish this goal by securing New York City Council approval.

ATLANTA'S CITY-RUN GROCERY SEES EARLY SUCCESS, SPARKING DEBATE OVER GOVERNMENT'S ROLE

Billionaire John Catsimatidis, owner of Gristedes and D'Agostino's, the largest independent supermarket chain in New York City, has previously said he would consider moving his corporate office out of New York following a Mamdani win.

Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens has launched a similar pilot program, opening a city-owned grocery store in a neighborhood long classified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a low-income, low-access food desert.

Mamdani has vowed to ""permanently eliminate the fare on every city bus and make them faster by rapidly building priority lanes, expanding bus queue-jump signals and dedicated loading zones to keep double parkers out of the way.""

TRUMP ADMIN HALTS $18B IN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TWO OF NYC'S BIGGEST TRANSIT PROJECTS

This proposal would require coordination with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). MTA is a state-run agency which the mayor of New York City does not have direct control over. 

According to City & State New York, Mamdani's free bus fare promise would require an additional expense, possibly more than $700 million. It's unclear how Mamdani plans to pay for the additional fee.

One of the more ambitious plans is to raise the city's minimum wage to $30 by 2030. (Adam Gray/Bloomberg/Getty Images)

Additionally, Mamdani has said he wants to raise the minimum wage to $30 an hour in the next four years.

""After that, the minimum wage will automatically increase based on the cost of living and productivity increases,"" Mamdani claims on his campaign website. 

MAMDANI'S RISE IN NYC MIRRORS ECONOMIC FLIGHT TO THE SOUTH, STUDY SHOWS

By allowing the City Council to create its own minimum wage law, Mamdani has proposed a way to raise the minimum wage in New York City without the state's approval. But a state-level increase is unlikely.

Mamdani has also campaigned to provide every New York family that has a child up to 5 years old with free childcare. 

It is unclear how he will finance this proposal, which experts estimate could cost billions of dollars annually. 

He has previously floated a tax increase on the wealthiest New Yorkers and corporations to pay for the increased services, which would require state-level approval. 

Experts warn that freezing rent for rent-stabilized apartments could drive up costs for other renters. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty Images)

Mamdani has pledged to freeze rents for tenants in rent-stabilized apartments and expand affordable housing using city resources.

While a rent freeze may sound like a straightforward fix to New York City's affordability crisis, housing experts warn it could backfire by discouraging investment and pushing rents higher in non-stabilized units.

ACKMAN SAYS MAMDANI ‘RIGHT ON PROBLEM, WRONG ON FIX' IN NYC HOUSING DEBATE

New York Apartment Association CEO Kenny Burgos said the policy could deter developers. ""I don't know any investor or builder who would want to build in a city where the mayor is threatening to cap revenues,"" Burgos told FOX Business.

Ed Elson, a business analyst and co-host of the ""Prof G Markets"" podcast, echoed that concern, saying rent freezes undermine supply. ""Paradoxically, they disincentivize construction, which causes rents elsewhere to rise,"" he said, calling the policy ""too good to be true.""

Mamdani has floated taxing the wealthiest New Yorkers to help finance some of his economic agenda. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty Images)

Mamdani said he would fund his programs through a ""revenue plan"" that would ""raise the corporate tax rate to match New Jersey's 11.5%, bringing in $5 billion. And he will tax the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers, those earning above $1 million annually, a flat 2% tax.""

While Mamdani has certainly done the math, a plan like this requires approval from the state legislature and the signature of the governor. 

TREASURY'S BESSENT WARNS NYC: NO BAILOUT UNDER MAMDANI – ‘DROP DEAD'

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has voiced her opposition to tax hikes, which could create some hurdles for Mamdani's marquee campaign promise.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The fall and rise of the Left's premier dark money network","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/4050359/fluctuating-left-wing-premier-dark-money-network/","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

Few names have accrued as much infamy among Washington, D.C., conservatives as Arabella Advisors. The consulting firm, which, until recently, ran a sprawling network of liberal nonprofit organizations, has acquired a similar status to the likes of megadonors George Soros and Bill Gates in certain right-wing circles.

Among other things, conservatives accused the consultancy of operating as a multibillion-dollar dark money ATM for left-wing causes, allowing foreign money to flow into American politics, and blurring the lines between charitable work and political advocacy. The Republican crusade against Arabella has produced legislation, congressional investigations, litigation, and even an investigation from the district's attorney general.

Following years of pressure, Arabella announced that it would be shuttering. To replace it, a trio of nonprofit organizations previously managed by Arabella has formed a public benefit corporation called Sunflower Services, which will be used to manage the three nonprofit organizations as well as a handful of additional undisclosed nonprofit organizations.

Reactions as to what this means for the network were mixed.

The Washington Free Beacon reported that “under the rebrand, things will remain functionally the same for Arabella's dark money network.” Meanwhile, the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which is friendlier toward liberals, wrote that the reshuffling “marks a significant shift for the consultancy world.”

Before the reshuffle, Arabella managed the New Venture, Windward, Hopewell, Sixteen Thirty, North, Telescope, and Impetus funds — the first three of which are 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations that will control Sunflower Services, while the latter four are 501(c)(4) organizations.

501(c)(3) groups face strict restrictions on their political activity, being barred from campaigning for or against candidates for public office and only being allowed to dedicate a limited amount of their expenditures to lobbying on nonpartisan matters. 501(c)(4) organizations, in exchange for not being able to offer tax deductions for donations, have much greater political license — being able to spend directly on electioneering, partisan lobbying, and political messaging. Donations to both types of nonprofit organizations are fully anonymous, leading to Arabella's “dark money” label.

There was initially some ambiguity as to whether the Sixteen Thirty Fund, Arabella's largest and most important 501(c)(4), would be involved with the Sunflower Services when the reshuffling was first announced. This fueled speculation that the reorganization could serve to remedy possible legal matters arising from the network's unusual organizational structure, especially with a GOP-led IRS breathing down its neck.

However, a spokesperson for the Sixteen Thirty Fund told the Free Press on Dec. 12 that it would not take an ownership interest in Sunflower Services but that it would contract with it for services “to support finance, HR, grants management, and compliance.” The fate of the North Fund, Arabella's other major 501(c)(4), which most recently reported holding $62.4 million in assets, remains uncertain. 

Right-of-center nonprofit experts previously told the Washington Examiner that the organizational change could functionally be a simple rebrand, allowing Arabella to shed the toxic branding and defang GOP legal attacks given its new name and structure. 

“Let's say they're still working hand-in-glove with the 501(c)(3)s and the 501(c)(4)s, but you've got the operation separated into two different legal entities,” Capital Research Center President Scott Walter told the Washington Examiner. “That makes the story much harder, and to the extent that we've succeeded in making Arabella well-known, now we have to make Sunflower and Vital Impact well-known.”

Eric Kessler, an alumnus of the Clinton administration, founded Arabella Advisors in 2005 as a philanthropic consulting firm and quickly grew it into what the Atlantic described as the “mothership” of the liberal financial world.

Walter, whose organization was at the forefront of documenting the network's development, told the Washington Examiner that Arabella went through three major phases before its reshuffling. 

“It starts with nothing to begin with,” Walter said. “It's just Eric Kessler setting this thing up out of his garage in '05, and '07 is the first year the nonprofits take in more than a million. What's now called the New Venture Fund takes in $1.7 million, and $1 million of that was from Hansjörg Wyss, a foreign national billionaire.”

Wyss is a Swiss billionaire who some on the Right have likened to Soros, owing to his similar proclivity for bankrolling left-wing causes. His being a Swiss national has led to allegations that Arabella facilitated the flow of foreign funds into U.S. politics. Walter called Wyss the “original sugar daddy” of the Arabella network.

“Stage two is when they realize that, if they want to keep this fabulous growth going, they need to have somebody who really knows business,” Walter continued. “So that's when they hire Sampriti Ganguli. She had no experience whatsoever in the nonprofit sector. She was just a sharp CEO-type. They hired her, and she focused on tripling revenue.”

As Walter pointed out, tax filings show that Arabella's constituent nonprofit organizations saw explosive fundraising growth during Ganguli's tenure as CEO. New Venture Fund, for instance, saw its revenue spike from $461 million in 2019 to $975 million in 2020. Meanwhile, Sixteen Thirty Fund saw its revenue increase from $181 million in 2019 to $390 million in 2020. Fundraising numbers remained high at Arabella's nonprofit organizations from 2020 onward.

“But then they realize, if we want to keep getting even richer and bigger, we need serious capital infusions,” Walter said, explaining the genesis of the network's third phase.

Concentric Equity Partners, a private equity firm based in Chicago, bought out Arabella in 2020. During the period, Walter said, Arabella purchased competing philanthropic management firms. Concentric Equity Partners was partially divested from Arabella at one point and, in November, Arabella announced its dissolution and the foundation of Sunflower Services to replace it. 

Before its restructuring, Arabella wielded power through various means. Among them were “pop-up” groups that critics accused the network of using to spoof grassroots support for its favored policies, funding for local media operations, get-out-the-vote efforts that targeted pro-Democratic demographics, direct political contributions to liberal PACs, and funding for state ballot initiatives. 

Perhaps the most controversial of Arabella's tactics was the Sixteen Thirty Fund's spending on state ballot initiatives.

The controversy arose from what conservatives described as widespread loopholes in state election laws nationwide. Several states allowed 501(c)(4) nonprofit organizations to financially support or oppose ballot initiatives. Conservatives alleged that, since 501(c)(4) nonprofit organizations are allowed to take funds from foreign donors, foreign money could be flooding state elections to help liberal activists achieve their policy objectives.

States were indeed flooded with money from the Sixteen Thirty Fund to sway their ballot initiatives, especially to provide expanded access to abortion following the Supreme Court's overruling of Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Sixteen Thirty Fund spent roughly $79 million on 33 different state referendums between 2017 and 2023, according to Ballotpedia, a nonprofit election information resource.

During this same period, Wyss, the foreign billionaire, was counted among the fund's largest known donors, directing hundreds of millions of dollars its way. Conservatives pointed to this as evidence that foreign funds could be finding their way into American elections. Representatives for both Wyss and the Sixteen Thirty Fund maintained that they were obeying the law when approached by the press, but they would stop short of confirming or denying that Wyss's money was making its way into politics broadly.

In response, states such as Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Wyoming enacted legislation that would expressly prohibit foreign funds from being spent on domestic ballot referendums. 

Comparably controversial was the Arabella network's vast array of groups, which it legally controlled, but which had branding suggesting they were local or grassroots in nature. Critics of the network dubbed these “pop-up” groups. District corporate records show that the Sixteen Thirty Fund operates groups such as these under reams of trade names, including “Families Over Billionaires,” “Arizonans United for Health Care,” “Keep Iowa Healthy,” “Floridians for a Fair Shake,” and “Michigan Families for Economic Prosperity.”

One investigation conducted by the Daily Caller News Foundation in 2023 found that the Log Off Movement and Design It For Us, a pair of nonprofit organizations that were presenting themselves as part of a grassroots youth movement to increase regulation of social media, were, in actuality, arms of the North Fund. Corporate records show that the organizations became independent after the investigation.

“These groups like to present as grassroots-driven, and too many reporters treat them that way, when in fact the Arabella ‘dark money' empire is orchestrating these political campaigns at the behest of left-wing megadonors,” Walter said at the time. 

Some have accused the Arabella network's 501(c)(3) arms of pushing the limit regarding how political a charity can be. 

During the 2022 midterm elections, Arabella network pumped over $62 million into groups focused on registering, engaging, and mobilizing voters, largely from demographics that have historically favored the Democratic Party. Much of this came from the network's 501(c)(3) arms.

“The Arabella Advisors Network is not in the business of charity, and the tens of millions they have sent to ‘charitable' get-out-the-vote and voter registration groups is just more proof that they aren't either,” Parker Thayer, an investigative researcher at Capital Research Center, said at the time. “Voter registration nonprofits are nothing more than a cost-effective way to achieve partisan electioneering results for Democrats while keeping the donors totally anonymous and giving them a tax write-off for their troubles.”

LIBERAL DARK MONEY GIANT REBRANDS TO DODGE SCRUTINY, OBSERVERS SAY

For instance, the New Venture Fund reported an $8.5 million grant to the Voter Registration Project, an organization that was “commissioned” by top Democratic operative John Podesta to encourage primarily liberal demographics, such as low-income individuals, African Americans, and Latinos, to cast ballots.

According to some, that money is not going anywhere.

“They were the biggest ‘dark money' operation anywhere on the political spectrum,” Walter said of Arabella. “Finally, after seven years of exposing them, we've embarrassed them enough that they felt the need to rebrand. And given that it doesn't look like they're going to change their operations much, we expect they'll continue to be a heavyweight player in ‘dark money' and politicized nonprofits.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

In a New Year congratulation on X, Strategy, the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder led by Michael Saylor, wrote that data strategy has never mattered more and pointed to 2025 as the year enterprises moved from fragmented tools to unified, AI-ready data foundations. Basically, their 2026 pitch came as — simplify, scale and unlock insights.

This message comes as the Bitcoin side of Strategy's business remains enormous on paper with 672,497 BTC on balance, each of which was bought at an average cost per coin of $75,004. As it stands, the unrealized gain right now amounts to 17.04%, and the whole stash is valued at around $59.04 billion.

Data strategy has never mattered more.

In 2025, organizations moved from fragmented tools to unified, AI-ready data foundations. In 2026, we will keep helping enterprises simplify, scale, and unlock insights.

Happy New Year from Strategy! Here is to what is next. 🚀🧡#AIReady… pic.twitter.com/jhUMfbIaZf

However, the equity is acting as if it wants a different story. A TradingView chart shows MSTR at $151.95 on the day, down 2.35%, after a long comedown from 2025 highs. This serves as a reminder that Bitcoin exposure currently is a crowded trade, especially when the chart stops cooperating.

No Bitcoin for Saylor in 2026?

The numbers behind the facade support the pivot. Market cap is shown at nearly $44 billion, with enterprise value at nearly $57 billion. The firm's own dashboard puts mNAV at 0.739 (basic), 0.824 (diluted) and 0.967 (EV), which indicates that the market is not paying a premium for the coins right now.

Therefore, the 2026 message is really understandable: start selling the AI infrastructure again. If enterprise AI spending continues to accelerate, then budgets will be allocated to data foundations and semantic layers, and Strategy is signaling it plans to be there whether Bitcoin is trending or not.

OpenAI is betting big on audio AI, and it's not just about making ChatGPT sound better. According to new reporting from The Information, the company has unified several engineering, product, and research teams over the past two months to overhaul its audio models, all in preparation for an audio-first personal device expected to launch in about a year.

The move reflects where the entire tech industry is headed — toward a future where screens become background noise and audio takes center stage. Smart speakers have already made voice assistants a fixture in more than a third of U.S. homes. Meta just rolled out a feature for its Ray-Ban smart glasses that uses a five-microphone array to help you hear conversations in noisy rooms — essentially turning your face into a directional listening device. Google, meanwhile, began experimenting in June with “Audio Overviews” that transform search results into conversational summaries. And Tesla is integrating Grok and other LLMs into its vehicles to create conversational voice assistants that can handle everything from navigation to climate control through natural dialogue.

It's not just the tech giants placing this bet. A motley crew of startups has emerged with the same conviction, albeit with varying degrees of success. The makers of the Humane AI Pin burned through hundreds of millions before their screenless wearable became a cautionary tale. The Friend AI pendant, a necklace that records your life and offers companionship, has sparked privacy concerns and existential dread in equal measure. And now at least two companies, including Sandbar and one helmed by Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky, are building AI rings expected to debut in 2026, allowing wearers to literally talk to the hand. 

The form factors may differ, but the thesis is the same: audio is the interface of the future. Every space — your home, your car, even your face — is becoming an interface. 

OpenAI's new audio model, slated for early 2026, will reportedly sound more natural, handle interruptions like an actual conversation partner, and even speak while you're talking, which is something today's models can't manage. The company is also said to envision a family of devices, possibly including glasses or screenless smart speakers, that act less like tools and more like companions.

As The Information notes, former Apple design chief Jony Ive, who joined OpenAI's hardware efforts through the company's $6.5 billion acquisition in May of his firm io, has made reducing device addiction a priority, seeing audio-first design as a chance to “right the wrongs” of past consumer gadgets.

By contrast, you remember things in your youth that happened only once, like spraining my ankle at a crossing with a train oncoming (it was less dramatic that it sounds lol), or going to a music festival, or finishing high school.One thing that maybe needs to be talked about is that you can simply relive your life. This works best if you had a good time. So the answer to the question is not just that you should look for new firsts, you can replay some old tapes.I'm lucky enough that I know people from every time in my life. I have a chat group with three other guys that I met when we were 4 years old, over 40 years ago. They sent messages last night. I got a message from my first grade teacher, and my high school English teacher. I have a chat with all my buddies from school, where we exchange messages that are about as mature as when we were teenagers. People I worked with, I keep in touch with.I have an online photo album that is basically the only data I care to have a backup of. Now and again, I flip through it, and I see what I was up to, and have nice thoughts about that.It might sound a bit weird for a mid-40s guy to be so resigned to being old. But I was talking to one of the mentioned buddies from nursery, and I turns out the big milestones have happened already. We already finished school, got jobs, had kids. There's a lot of little things to tick off, but they are little things: visiting various interesting sites, going to some concert, and so on.

For me as a child, even getting a haircut was a dreary experience. It felt as an eternity I had to sit mostly immobile, while somebody else maneuvered sharp blades around my head. Nowadays it feels like I barely accomodated in the chair, it's already over.

Move to a new city, get a radically different job, get a kid, switch up your routine, pick up unusual hobbies/interests and every year will feel like a new life.
Childhood feels very long because you have to go through mandatory checkpoints imposed from the outside, add that to your adult life and it'll feel the same. Why don't you go get a parachute intro course next weekend? Or rent a car on a race track? Go ice climbing next winter? Join a yoga club, a music class, a reading group, a dance class, &c. try things you don't necessarily want to do and you'll open many doors.Most humans have a tendency to go the path of least resistance, and in today's world of working from home and unlimited screen based entertainment you can very easily waste decades your life

Much downside to this but the upside is my life feels incredibly long and I haven't even reached 50 yet. I have already lived numerous lives compared to the self that would have had a very stable life the last 25 years. My working life feels vastly longer than my very stable childhood. That came and went in the blink of an eye from this perspective.

The 'vicarious firsts' framing doesn't quite land for me because of that, but the 'urgency that won't let you drift' observation resonates. Maybe what matters isn't renewed wonder but having something -- family, friends, caring about the world -- that demands presence. The forcing function matters more than the feelings themselves.My dad always says something related in nature: caring about and loving your family makes you a better person more than it helps your family.

It's a cliché but I (almost 50 years old) have found that when you get older, you notice patterns, Something ""new"" is often just an incremental improvement or two existing things combined.Rust doesn't excite me much, and Go seems too boring to use for my side projects. Elixir + Phoenix LiveView is the only ""new"" thing that has excited me in the past decade, but I can't stand the Elixir syntax. Maybe it's because I have seen so much change during the years? If someone started out with React, a new version seems like a big deal, but to me it is just an incremental improvement.When I was a kid, a new CPU or GPU had an extreme impact compared to the previous generations. We went from crappy Wolfenstein graphics to Quake in a few years. I have stopped following new releases now, because they don't really do much.The same applies to mobile phones. The next iphone / samsung model doesn't really motivate me to replace my existing phone.

Similar to you, I don't care about mobile phones anymore. Instead of fancy hardware or features what I care is simple, secure, and private phone (open-source OS). I used to get excited on new models.Recently a couple of my friends were talking about ""Telegram vs Whatsapp."" One is better because it has this feature, etc. They asked my opinion too. I don't care which is better, I only use them because I have to use them for contacting family and some friends. I just need the send text and image functionality (and I don't use it for private / secure texting).

But for most of things in life you just need to use them.The hard part is finding something to geek out on that doesn't turn you into a curmudgeon insisting everyone is “doing it wrong”.

Could anyone who is extremely fortunate and never had to work for money share their experience on this?I find that the years that I spent on art (playing around, learning new things, not taking other peoples' orders) lasted longer than the ones I spent doing software development for money.  Both were fun, but the remaining memories differ by intensity.I personally don't find the logarithmic experience theory convincing.  Why are the first three or so years excluded from this?  It seems more likely that new experiences make more impact, or that repeated memories make them more intense.  Or dozens of other theories.

If anything, having new experiences is what seems to slow down time in my experience.  Visiting new locations, doing and learning new things.  I suppose more things will be new to the young than the old, so it would make sense as an alternative hypothesis.I've also had a bad tooth ache since the day before Christmas I haven't been able to get dealt with since all the local dentists are off, and it feels like it's been the longest week in my life.  Dunno if I'd recommend it as a way of prolonging the subjective experience of time though.Another anecdote is that last year I quit coffee cold turkey, and a side effect was that time seemed to slow down significantly.  A lot of people seem to be reporting this.  Make of it what you want.  Quitting coffee also sucks quite a lot, though not as bad as week of severe tooth ache.

But in hindsight, time passes slow in periods where you had many new experiences and is almost missing in periods of routine.So an exciting experience might be fast in the moment and slow in hindsight.

But said and done, I came back on Monday, they looked at it again, said it was probably an old filling that was maybe acting up, basically just drilled a bit and filled it back up again.  This made it hurt a bit less for about a day (specially during the procedure, even with them drilling into the tooth, local anaesthetic made this the least discomfort I'd been in for almost a week), but since then it's been aching again.  It's not as bad as before, but still barely manageable with OTC painkillers.So tomorrow I'm hitting them up again, hopefully I'm able to convince them to pull the tooth, since it's way back in the mouth and has been nothing but causing me grief since I got the original filling, food getting stuck and causing inflammation, that sort of stuff.  The alternative would probably be a root canal, but since it's in a very inaccessible location, that's a real hassle.

From my experience childhood felt like grinding my way to max level in an MMO. Had to be done to start playing the game but didn't really care for it. I had more freedom since I was 18 than before so I cherish those memories more.

Some really enjoy that, but the journey to max level was always more interesting to me.There is a way to reroll; at least vicariously.

Tourism is generally forgettable and I don't recommend it to anyone - save the money and do something where you live.Backpacking feels meaningful in the moment, but is also largely forgettable. I truly have almost no meaningful memories from 2 separate 2 month trips in Europe and southeast Asia.The slow travel is most recent, was the most ""boring"" but also, I think, most meaningful as I was explicitly focused on self-reflection and discovery of a more meaningful way to live after many years (or a lifetime, really) of aiming to be a better cog in the machine. I don't have a lot of ""memories"" - highlights that I reminisce about - from it, but rather various phase shifts/epiphanies in my understanding of myself, life, the world etc...I now live in relative poverty in a poor country where I have been working for 7+ years to develop a project for the benefit of the multitudes who can't even conceive of being able to do anything that I've just describe. And for whom even childhood is rather joy and wonder-less, because of how hard life is. I'm mostly glued to my computer again, but it's not soul sucking in the way it was in a cubicle with spreadsheets - because the purpose is meaningful.I do miss the slow travel days - they were absolutely the most enjoyable period of my life.

Was your schedule oversubscribed in these ? I ask because my experience of pleasure travel is very different. More so when there were (i) very little schedule to speak of, other than start and end dates, (ii) had a partner to share the experience of unplanned discovery to share with.Both, I think, make a significant difference to the experience.The other biggie are photographs and writing about it.

I dont have any idea what this means. Could  you try again in plain english?Yes, not having a schedule makes for better travel, as I described in my later multi-year experience. I think most things could probably be made better by having a genuine life partner to share it with. But doing things solo absolutely does not preclude you from meaning. (moreover, I wouldnt describe most romantic relationships as anything resembling a genuine life partner).Photos and writing are also not inherently meaningful. I did plenty of both and, again, I thought it was all meaningful in the moment, but since realized it was all largely misguided.If someone were to travel in a genuine manner - where you integrate with local communities, get involved with their traditions, problems etc, then that's an entirely other thing. But just roaming (let alone an itinerary) is largely not actually useful, unless you put it towards something meaningful (eg genuine reflection and improvement, which would largely lead you to realizing that travels themselves are not necessary or even important).

I think this explanation is true but incomplete. I believe it's also related to Critical Flicker Fusion Frequency [0], the way I see it, if an organism is smaller it has a higher frequency, it sees more image per second, therefore perception of time is slower. (E.g. a fly sees you moving really slowly). Maybe it's related to the processing time of images, with smaller brains insect can process more of them per second.Maybe humans process more images as children, therefore see the time time going slower.It's been a while I didn't think about this, maybe some studies have been made in the past years.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold

But is that experiencing life, though? How many strong memories from that ""logarithmic first half"" of my life do I have? Actually very few compared to what came later, and they are not particularly compelling either.My guess is that the author just hit mid-life crisis after having spent one or two decades in an office. Boring mindless job is what makes life experience to plateau, not adulthood. If I think of the most accomplished persons that I know, who've done many things with their life, I can't imagine them saying that their childhood was half of their life. They would probably laugh at the idea.Or maybe he hasn't reached that crisis yet, since he finds solace in the idea that his child is doing the living for him. Wait until the kids leave home, for the log to turn into a exponential panic.

I was saying that you must do both - dont just slave away and expect that you'll live when you're retired (a lifestyle which makes it less likely that you would even live until retirement age, let alone be physically or even mentally capable of enjoying retirement).Instead, live in a way such that there it is meaningful while you do it, and it also prepares you for the future. Again, this would also have the benefit of showing your kids and others how to do this themselves.

For much of that there have been critical pressures making most days important. Which makes them memorable.Subjectively and objectively, things have changed so much, and so many times, I feel like I have had several lives, so far.Right now I am in a “make” or “break” situation going three productive years. I solved some very difficult problems that I put myself in a “must solve” position. Each problem solved had significant life impact.The indicators for “make” are going up month-to-month now, making it a tough but intense and wonderful time. Feels a lot like my early 20's when I started a dream business (for me) while in school.Definitely don't experience time as indicated by those graphs.

As an adult, especially a well paid SWE like many on HN.. you can create the life, make the decisions and have the experiences that you want.  Your life is as vibrant as you choose it to be.Much of the stuff I used to read about or watch on TV as a precocious child.. I can just go buy/see/do with the agency & money I have as an adult.Sure you have a 9-5 (or 8-6, or 7-7) job but you used to go to school and after school activities all day as a kid probably too.  It's your choice to do something or nothing with your hours of free time after work and weekends.Small children in the picture adds additional time constraints, but should also bring additional vividness/subjective time experience to your life.

The big thing which we need to change and solve is education --- I have memories of going to a school in Mississippi which my perception of was that it was quite well run, and that classes in it were divided between academic and social --- social classes were attended at one's age level, while academic classes were attended at one's ability level (4 grade cap up through 8th grade) and that students who progressed beyond high school courses were able to take college courses, some teachers being accredited as faculty at a local college, or instructors from that institution being brought to the school for classes at need.Maybe AP classes offer a similar facility in public school systems? Though one wants to cue the _Doonesbury_ cartoon of the college dean who after being told that his entire Freshman class is taking remedial 051 level _everything_ is running a glorified pre school.Roger Zelazny made much of college education becoming quite a different thing when Samuel Eliot of Harvard made the conceptual leap of dividing education by the college credit hour and allowing customization beyond the rote repetition of previous generations in his wonderful novel _Doorways in the Sand_ --- perhaps that should be extended down on some sort of skills basis? The school I attended after Mississippi did reading with a pair of boxes of Scholastic Reading Assessment (SRA) booklets, which, not understanding that one was supposed to do a two or three at each level and get approval on before moving to the next level, I did _all_ of in a matter of weeks, which left me with nothing to do for the balance of the school year but go to the (meager) elementary school library.

I think it does mean though that optimising for this is probably not the thing to do.

I, personally feel like having lived is a net win, joy-wise, mostly on the strength of my childhood. So I'm trying to give that to my sons as well.

I don't accept that premise. I'm in my mid-fifties now, and a year is still a long time. They years get short if you fall into a routine and never do anything new, but it is easy enough not to fall into that trap. And I say that as someone who thrives in doing the same routine every day.

I know people who cannot remember their childhood at all, and I've known people who remember it well. But not having vibrant memories of your adult life? That feels a little depressing.  Adulthood is when you step up and become your own self, directing your own life. It is when I climbed mountains, explored the world, met new people, tried different careers, moved to new towns, had long-term relationships including children, created art, studied subjects beyond the standard high school education.

If adult experiences make you resentful, something is really off. If a good experience makes you wish you could go back to being a child, I'd be recommending therapy because that is not the reaction most adults have to new experiences. I don't say that to be mean, either - if your childhood memories are that much stronger than adult ones, that is not the typical human experience, and I would sincerely be asking for medical and psych support to figure out if something is wrong.

Does this article seem accurate to your perception of life? It would explain some things regarding my interactions with most people if I am so completely missing something so fundemental about their existence.Edit: Why does conveying my experience and desiring to understand the experience of others get a downvote? Genuinely curious.Edit the second: I just started to wonder if this article is going to affect my birthday in a couple weeks. Part of me feels like I am going to think ""well that is 1/46th of my life gone"" and have a midlife crisis. The other part of me remembers Zeno and his paradox and giggles.

I'm going to combine this information with another idea.  The second idea comes from Tony Robbins, who tells us we can have mastery over our memories and use them to influence our psyche.You can magnify and clarify pleasing and positive memories.  You can diminish and distance unpleasant or painful ones.  This can change your view of the world, for better.

It sounds like the author has had a good childhood and is a good parent to their kids. Wonderful.But the whole article is appropriately summarized by their final sentences> You recreate your memories in them. They recreate childishness in you. Life folds back on itself, but not quite the same. It loops, but continues. A helix.
>
> Life, then, is the creation of childhoods. You have yours, and then you get to create childhoods for others. The time is yours, and theirsThey have completely given up on their own life, and the possibility that they, too, could live in a child-like way, where they have their own wonder, joy etc.Eg> Children make you childlike. Skipping through the park as an adult man raises eyebrows (deservedly or not.) Skipping through the park as an adult man with your son or daughter skipping next to you on your arm is one of life's greatest joys, both for you and for anyone who sees you.Why do you care about people's eyebrows? Go skip, play, dance, be curious, be creative - whether just for the sake of it, or also in your ""work"".Your kids need to see you actually living so that they, too, might be able to actually live once they've moved into adulthood.> Your Christmas trees get smaller, your lights less ambitious. Some find all of these fun for their own sake, but if you are not the type of person who finds ritual appealing you will likely find yourself slowly disconnecting from holidays. You will find yourself asking what all the hustle bustle is for.
>
> Kids. That's who it's for. Of all the experiences that children renew, traditions are renewed the most. When you put up a Christmas tree, it's for kids. When you decorate for Halloween, it's for kids. All of these holidays are in essence a celebration of childhood, and children let you see them all for the first time again. If you remember the excitement of galumphingChristmas, and other traditions, are NOT about trees and lights and presents. Thanksgiving is not about waiting to stampede a Walmart to buy crap. It's about genuine communion with family, friends, or - if you're particularly clued in - even strangers who don't have such traditions available to them.And so on.They talk about the joy of showing kids Saturn in a telescope.

The concept of time dilation explored in the article is fascinating. But I think it's possible the author has some wishful thinking about how experience and memory works. Or perhaps is using a plausible formulation as a reverse justification for his own life choices.Here is how my childhood memories feel to me. Ages 0-14 are like an opaque tunnel, through which my brain and developing body was shot, like a cannonball, in an instant. I have some fragmentary memories of having gone through that tunnel, but they are mere fragment. My 14 year old self, somehow and miraculously, ended up on the other side of that tunnel healthy and of sound mind.Age 14 is around where something resembling ""the recorded video of my early memory"" begins. I have clear memory of various episodes from ages 14-18, and this was also a period of intense individual development for me. This was where all my inclinations, passions, and life goals started to come into focus. That turned into full-blown adult individuation in college, where my goal was to pull away entirely from societal/parental expectations and live my own life. In other words: pretty much everything I associate with my adult character had its seed-like start in my age 14-18 period, exactly the period where I was pulling away from my developmental dependence on my parents.My childhood before then is a blur. That might be a depressing thought for parents -- that this kind of blurred and fragmentary memory of childhood is possible, given that parents often describe this period as one where they are ""making family memories"" -- but I don't think I'm the only one. Importantly: this doesn't make early parenting meaningless. Good parenting is ethically and developmentally important even when it doesn't leave the child with later-retrievable episodic memories. But I don't think the point of parenting is to create said memories. It's to create a healthy child who can develop and individuate on their own in adulthood.The article talks a lot about childlike wonder, and seeking that in adulthood. I'm all for that. But what's strange is that OP seems to believe the only place to find that childlike wonder is in parenting of your own children. I am sure parenting can be one such way to regain childlike wonder, but surely not the only one. People can reclaim their childlike wonder in sport, art, hobby, play, and travel, among other things. What's more, I know many parents who haven't the slightest bit of childlike wonder when they interact with their children. Or any other children in their family. So I'm not sure it comes as naturally to everyone as OP seems to think it does.Two adult thinkers on how adult humans spend their time that have interesting thoughts on childlike play are John Cleese and Alan Watts. Cleese discusses it in the context of creativity in his wonderful lecture, summarized here:https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/04/12/john-cleese-on-cre...And Watts had this to say about it: ""... if you don't have a room in your life for the playful, life's not worth living. 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.' But if the only reason for which Jack plays is that he can work better afterwards, he's not really playing. He's just playing because it's good for him! Well, he's not playing at all! You have to be able to cultivate an attitude to life where you're not trying to get anything out of it. You pick up a pebble on the beach and look at it: beautiful! Don't try and get a sermon out of it.""

Half of your life is childhood because you weighed subjective experiences differently when you had no knowledge or life experiences so you should change your life based on that situation where you were in Plato's cave?Actually fuck even this title is bad. If life is subjective, don't ask how “we” should live. Subjectiveness means that's a “you” question.

If keys are recovered using some form of low level hardware attack, as was almost surely the case here, the attacker can usually recover the unused key sets too.If the chip manufacturing provisioning supply chain is leaky the new keys will probably be disclosed anyway, and if the key custody chain is broken (ie, keys are shared with OEMs or third parties) they will definitely be disclosed anyway.

So if v1 is signed by key A, v2 is signed by key B and invalidates key A; a console that installs v2 wouldn't be able to install v1 after, but that's not a problem for Sony.But, I'm not sure how many companies would be able to manage their keys properly to ensure that someone with access to key A doesn't have access to key B.If these are asymmetric key pairs and the device side key was extracted from the device... Switching keys wouldn't help, and it's not a huge deal by itself --- having the device side key doesn't allow you to make a firmware image the device would accept.

Probably could have been avoided if Sony kept the Linux version of the Playstation still alive. Imagine what the (console) world would have looked like, if it was still alive. I never got the chance to even try it myself before it was gone, but I'm sure a lot of the homebrew community's energy could have been redirected towards it instead, hitting two flies with one swath.

The causality here is backwards; Sony removed Other OS support precisely because the first jailbreak (a glitching attack) relied on it.

If there was a breach, I'd expect keys for the PS4 to be leaked as well which would be quite handy. There are soft jailbreaks you can do currently on the PS4, but they're not full on CFW (custom firmware) and don't persist reboots.

Nasty filler to add that to the page.General question: (I don't know enough about cryptography)Are these symmetric keys or asymmetric ones? Both allow you to decrypt, but only the former would allow you to make changes to it, whereas the latter would still require you to find an exploit in the next stage. I think?

However, a huge difference is that on CDs you're up against a fixed maximum (0 dBFS) so all peaks are equal, which is fatiguing; on vinyl you're up against the adjacent groove, so your maximum amplitude any given moment depends on the amplitude of things in the recent past and near future! Ways to optimize for this are prevalent, amazingly, and the result is less fatiguing.

I'd love to learn how you came to this definitive conclusion. At no point in human history have humans not worked (I'm sure there are some limited exceptions, none of which have been sustainable).Perhaps you meant to say the point of life is to survive, but you have to work to make that happen.

In my family group there were a good numbers of vinyls gifted this past christmas and none of them are going to be regularly listened to as the majority of music consumption they do is ""on the go"" in the car or mobile.Similarly, I'm seeing them make more purchases of ""trophy books"" where they read the book on their phone or listened to the audiobook but liked the book so much that they want to have it on their shelf (there are also special editions with elaborate edge decorations, etc. that seem to feed into this).

Yeah, in some way that's true. In the house music scene almost every producer also sells vinyls of their best songs, sometimes ""collectors editions"", and also DJs obviously sometimes pride themselves on only playing vinyl. For the artists I really do enjoy, I tend to buy their songs + with the vinyl, as a way to support them, but I indeed have no way of actually playing them, and haven't had for more than a decade.So here I sit with 20+ vinyl records, most of them unopened, and no record player. But I don't mind, I just want to give money to the artists that provide me joy.

I have many happy memories of getting a new record as kid, laying in the floor and listening from start to finish while poring over liner notes and album art. There was a level of connection with the music that I just don't get from listening to Spotify while I'm washing the dishes or something.I know it's sentimental, but I get so much joy out of watching my daughter do the same thing now. She has a blast going to our local record store, finding records from her favorite bands old and new and then coming home and just listening. No devices, no distractions, just her and the music she loves. In a sometimes horrible and depressing world, it's a sweet escape.

I'm a recovering audiophile. I got into the hobby because I enjoy technology in its myriad aspects, and had discovered that good speakers can make things sound better. As I began accruing CDs and re-ripping into lossless audio, I also began collecting vinyls via Record Store Day events of bands or artists I found interesting at the time, or the odd Collector's Edition bundles of albums or games. The thinking was that when I finally settled into my own place, I could invest into some Hi-Fi kit to play them back.Well, I fell out of the audiophile sphere when I got into data analysis, physics, human biology, and psychology: I had become inoculated against the bullshit that permeates the space, but still recognized the value of my album collection. I'd also pivoted into preservation, and so I began accepting relatives' collections of older formats, like 78s. I still lacked playback mechanisms, though I now had the space and budget - just more pressing projects than a record playback setup.And so here I am in 2025, in an apartment that transmits energy between units, with an upstairs neighbor that does somersaults and tumbles all day (thus shaking the space slightly). The cost of everything has skyrocketed, but it's no longer a matter of a turntable and a phono stage to get going (need isolation as well, and that ain't cheap). I've also - shockingly - got other, more pressing projects in front of me, one of which is a bedroom Hi-Fi setup that has physical controls for music streaming instead of smartphone apps - again, not remotely cheap.Right now, my meager collection sits in a crate under the sofa, languishing. One day I'll get to enjoy them, but today is sadly not that day.

I gave all my CDs (probably more than a 1000) away about a decade ago. I find physical media annoying, they take up space and require more effort to use them. All those CDs became more of a burden. I guess it's because I grew up with cassette tapes, portable tape players, then CDs, then Discman, then Discman with buffering. Having gone through all of that, being able to play music on your phone is... excessively nice. I also care more about the music than the packaging -- if I want something nice on the wall, I would get a painting, litho, etc. instead.The only thing I really miss is old-school music discovery. Reading reviews, then going to a record shop, listening a stack of records to decide, talking to record shop owners and friends for scoops, etc. was so much more fun than letting algorithms do recommendations. And after spending your monthly pocket money on two albums, you were invested in the music.

The first is that even if people don't own a record player at the moment doesn't mean that they don't plan on getting one. I have multiple nieces/nephews who got record players (at their request!) this year for Christmas. Briefcase record players are becoming ridiculously more popular. The thing is there's no point in buying a record player if you don't already have some records, and artists are doing a lot more limited prints so sometimes you need to buy immediately to be sure you're going to get one.My wife and I bought a new sound system in 2024, and we decided to include a record player. We have used it way more we had expected to. We still have streaming services (Tidal) but listening to a record has a ton of benefits. There's the fact that the entire album itself is an organized experience, not just random tracks, and the tactile nature of it is really appealing. The albums themselves are like pieces of artwork in a way that a CD or screensaver would never be.It's also nice knowing that the artist I'm buying from is getting real money from the purchase, unlike the pennies they get from streaming.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

The pandemic had a noticeable impact on the environment, though not always on the same scale. While the rare absence of humans reduced some pollution to nature, that sudden change also encouraged more aggressive behavior from invasive species. Then there are cases, like the one involving the dark-eyed juncos in California, that don't quite fit in either category.

In a recent paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists reported that during and after the pandemic, dark-eyed juncos experienced two quick evolutionary changes. Specifically, the small songbirds' beaks grew longer during the pandemic and then became stubbier once more as human activity resumed, just like in the movie, Pinocchio. But in this case, there wasn't any magic or morals about honesty involved—just the consequences of human influence on nature.

“We have this idea of evolution as slow because, in general, over evolutionary time, it is slow,” Pamela Yeh, one of the study's lead authors and an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), said in a statement. “But it's amazing to be able to see evolution happening before your eyes and to see a clear human effect changing a living population.”

Dark-eyed juncos generally reside in mountain forests, but in southern California, climate change drove a sizable population of the birds into cities, where they learned to pick off crumbs and scraps from human food waste. Compared to their mountainous relatives, the beaks of Californian juncos evolved to become short and stubby.

“Wild animals have to work hard to find and get their food. When humans make it that much easier, the parts of their bodies, such as their mouths, that animals use for foraging adapt,” Yeh explained.

So when the juncos settled nicely onto UCLA's campus, they caught the attention of Yeh and her colleagues, who began a long-term study of the songbirds in 2018. Surprisingly, the birds had gradually developed a diet “closer to the average college student,” Ellie Diamant, the study's other lead author and an evolutionary biologist at Bard College, told The New York Times. So that included “things like cookies, bread… [and] pizza,” she recalled.

Then the pandemic struck. As classes shifted online, the campus became mostly abandoned and scrap-free—much to the detriment of juncos. It was around 2021, roughly a year after the start of the pandemic, that Yeh and Diamant noticed a slight change in newborn juncos: a longer, slimmer beak.

“We were quite shocked, to be honest, when we saw just how strong that change was,” Diamant recalled. In such a short period of time, California juncos had essentially “evolved” so that their bills were back to the shape held by their counterparts in the wild. That change likely increased the success rate of foraging for the birds, Diamant added.

But as pandemic restrictions loosened, UCLA students, faculty, and staff returned to campus. Remarkably, as people returned, so did the shape of the juncos' beaks. As quickly as the beaks had grown, they shrank back again in junco chicks born between 2023 and 2024.

“It is remarkable evidence of these birds' rapid ability to adapt to changes in their environment and food resources,” noted Graciela Gómez Nicola, a biologist at Complutense University of Madrid who was not involved in the study, to Science Media Centre Spain.

There have been other recent studies on how exposure to human activity has changed the morphology of wild animals. But juncos are somewhat different from other urban birds like house sparrows or pigeons, the researchers explained. House sparrows and pigeons are “in some ways pre-adapted to live with people” due to their generalist diet, tendency to flock, and capability to nest in human structures.

Juncos, by contrast, are territorial and typically nest on the ground. So the dark-eyed juncos of UCLA, as common as they may be on campus, represent an ongoing evolutionary mystery, the researchers concluded.

“I don't feel like we have a lot of success stories when we think about how human behavior affects wildlife,” Yeh said. “I wouldn't fully call it a success story yet, but it's not a disaster story, and that's no small thing.”

Breaking the previous record by just a few megahertz.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD is set to take the stage at CES in just a few days where it's expected to unveil two new X3D chips, one of them being the 9850X3D, which is said to succeed the existing Ryzen 7 9800X3D. So, this seems like the perfect time to break the world record for the outgoing best gaming CPU, giving it a final tribute before it's replaced. Chinese overlocker ""Hero"" has just pushed the 9800X3D to 7,335.48 MHz, breaking the previous world record by just a smidge.

Hero used the recently-launched Colorful iGame X870E Vulcan OC V14 motherboard, a flagship offering from the company featuring an 18+2+2 phase VRM setup. It's made with overclocking in mind for both the processor and the RAM, with only two DIMM slots for that reason. The CPU-Z screenshot and HWBot listing don't tell us exactly what memory was used (apart from DDR5), but it does shine light on the CPU's settings.

The overclocker employed an unusually high voltage of 1.688V, which wouldn't be practical in real-world usage. This makes sense since the HWBot page is categorized under single-core peak frequency and not sustained load. As such, liquid nitrogen was expectedly utilized to keep the chip cool, and that translated in the uncore frequency also hitting 2,399.2 MHz — something that actually would make a difference in day-to-day performance.

The previous record holder for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D was a Taiwanese overclocker named ""Hicookie,"" who managed to reach 7,313 MHz using a Gigabyte X870 Aorus Tachyon Ice. The new world record, therefore, is just 22 MHz higher. That might seem like nothing in the grand scheme of things, but comes to world records, every little bit matters. Now it's just a matter of time before another overclocker takes over and the cycle repeats.

DALLAS — If you're looking to get your hands on tickets to the FIFA World Cup, you're gonna need a good amount of luck on your side. 

FIFA announced on Monday, Dec. 29, that they had received 150 million ticket requests in the Random Selection Draw, which began on Dec. 11. Through the first two draws – the Visa exclusive presale and Early Ticket Draw – FIFA said 2 million tickets had been sold. There will be approximately 6 million tickets sold for the entire tournament, according to FIFA.

When FIFA announced the high interest in ticket applications, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said the demand represents 3.4 times more than the overall number of spectators who have attended all 964 matches that make up the 22 editions of the competition combined since 1930.

There have been, on average, 10 million ticket applications submitted per day in the Random Selection Draw. If that trend continues through the application window, which closes on Tuesday, Jan. 13, FIFA would receive nearly 300 million applications. As we've stated before, FIFA has sold, on average, 1 million tickets per draw period. 

That means, you'd have a 1 in 300 chance (0.33%) for your application to be approved. 

It's unclear just how many tickets will be sold in this window (maybe it'll be more than 1 million, who knows?), but Infantino said some tickets will be held for subsequent sales phases. 

Even if FIFA sold 2 million tickets in this window – making the total 4 million to date out of the 6 million – your chances would be 1 in 150 (0.67%).

It's much better than trying to win the Powerball, where your odds are approximately 1 in 292,000,000 (0.00000034%). But you'd have a better chance of winning any prize in the Powerball, the odds of which are approximately 1 in 24 (4.17%).

If the odds of getting FIFA tickets top out at 1 in 150, that means you have the same odds of getting a World Cup ticket as you would of being born with naturally red hair. 

Those are the same odds a professional baseball player has of hitting a home run in a single at-bat. 

When it comes to the 1 in 300 odds (the more likely situation), that means fans have the same odds of getting a ticket as they do of being born with six fingers. 

To put that in sports terms, 1 in 300 is the same odds as an amateur making a hole in one in a single round of golf. 

WFAA asked FIFA how many ""ticket requests"" were submitted in the Visa Presale and Early Ticket Draw to get a scope of how the odds for the Random Selection Draw compare to the two windows prior, but were referred to previous press releases that only mention the amount of tickets sold (1 million after the first; 2 million after the second).","{'href': 'https://www.wfaa.com', 'title': 'WFAA'}","soccer"

Enzo Maresca's departure from Chelsea has sparked movement elsewhere, with Strasbourg manager Liam Rosenior reportedly among the candidates under consideration at Stamford Bridge, according to The Guardian. Should Rosenior leave for Chelsea, Minnesota United head coach Eric Ramsay has been linked as a potential replacement at Strasbourg. Minnesota finished fourth in MLS's Western Conference last season.

Minnesota United could face uncertainty in the new year, with head coach Eric Ramsay reportedly linked to a potential move to Europe amid Chelsea's search for a new manager following Enzo Maresca's departure midway through the Premier League season.


According to The Guardian, Chelsea are assessing several candidates, including Strasbourg manager Liam Rosenior, as they look to fill the vacancy at Stamford Bridge. Porto head coach Francesco Farioli is also believed to be in the frame, with Chelsea hopeful of making an appointment in the coming days. The club may need to name an interim manager for their upcoming match against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.


Any move for Rosenior would depend on Strasbourg's ability to secure a suitable replacement for the 41-year-old. In that scenario, Ramsay has been linked as a potential option to take over at the Ligue 1 side, creating a possible knock-on effect.

Ramsay, 32, has posted a record of 38 wins, 16 draws, and 27 losses in 81 matches in charge of Minnesota United, earning praise for his work in MLS at a young age.

Meanwhile, Rosenior joined Chelsea's partner club Strasbourg in 2024 and led them to a seventh-place finish in Ligue 1 during his debut season.

Ramsay began his coaching career in youth football, working with Swansea City and Shrewsbury Town before spending two years in Chelsea's academy. He later joined Manchester United's first-team staff as an assistant coach in 2021 and had a brief spell with the Wales national team in 2023, before being appointed head coach of Minnesota United in February 2024.

Arsenal star Gabriel Magalhaes has explained why he took to trolling Amadou Onana after helping the Gunners to a vital victory over Premier League title rivals Aston Villa. The Brazilian defender returned with a bang in that contest, as he opened the scoring in a 4-1 win, and took the opportunity afterwards to have some “fun” when delivering a copycat “pocket” celebration.

Having suffered an adductor injury while on international duty in November, Gabriel stepped off the bench to play 19 minutes of Arsenal's battling 2-1 win over Brighton on December 27. He returned to Mikel Arteta's starting XI three days later when Villa paid a visit to north London.

After being frustrated by the Villans across the opening 45 minutes - with World Cup-winning former Gunners goalkeeper Emi Martinez up to his usual antics - the deadlock was broken at Emirates Stadium three minutes into the second half.

Gabriel was the man to force a breakthrough as he tussled with Martinez at a corner and bundled the ball over the line. Another set-piece goal put Arsenal on course for three priceless points that saw them enter 2026 five clear at the top of the Premier League table.

The mood was understandably upbeat inside Arsenal's camp as they made their way off the field after bringing Villa's run of 11 consecutive wins to a close. Gabriel could not resist the urge to troll domestic rival Onana when making his way back to the dressing room.

Belgium international midfielder Onana has made a habit of pretending to put three points in his pocket following Villa successes - with that routine worked through following victories over Manchester United and Chelsea.

The Villans were downbeat after coming unstuck at the Emirates, with head coach Unai Emery making a hasty retreat before shaking hands with opposite number Arteta, and Gabriel's behaviour is unlikely to have generated any smiles.

He is, however, adamant that his post-match celebration was just a bit of “fun”. Asked if he was offering a nod to Onana, Gabriel - who was caught on camera by the Gunners' in-house media team - said: “Yes, yes. Those sort of things spur you on. It's good fun. It's fun for them, it's fun for us as well. Like I said, we got the three points. It was not to get them back or to get Onana back. I know he's a good guy. So, yes, no fighting, nothing. It was just something to celebrate.”

Arsenal suffered a dramatic 2-1 defeat at Villa Park on December 6, but exacted revenge before the turn of the calendar year. Gabriel is delighted to be back playing his part in a quest for tangible success.

He added on returning from an enforced spell on the sidelines: “Personally, it feels very, very good. I'm very, very happy. It was a difficult day, but I worked a lot to come back as quickly as possible. Today I'm so happy to be back with the team with a big win.

“I think we need to go game by game and let's work together. And don't need to think about the other teams, think about us and the need to keep playing.”

Arteta said of having Gabriel back alongside established centre-half partner William Saliba: “He comes back from an injury of six weeks that probably should have been a bit longer, and plays against probably the team that is the hardest to control, especially the front players and the striker that they have, in terms of their movements and he impacted the game in an incredible way, both defending and in the opposition box.”

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


New Year's Day update on New Year's Eve business: 20th Century Studios/Disney's Avatar: Fire and Ash led what was a typical slow New Year's Eve, making $8.1M yesterday and taking its stateside cume to $250.2M. 


	Worldwide, Avatar: Fire and Ash stands north of $860M; it's bound to become Disney's third 2025 theatrical release to cross $1 billion after Zootopia 2 and Lilo & Stitch. 


	That running total is currently pacing -26% behind 2022's Avatar: Way of Water over the same span, 13 days, that sequel ending its run in North America at $684M (during its initial release, not counting re-release monies). Fire and Ash‘s 13-day cume is pacing -7% behind the original 2009 pic's total at the same point in time which was $268.8M (initial run's final theatrical was $749.9M).

	Note, by New Year's Eve, Avatar: Way of Water had been in theaters for 16 days. Way of Water‘s New Year's Eve total was $18M, while the original Avatar grossed $14.7M on that day.    




			Watch on Deadline		







	In the U.S./Canada, New Year's Eve always takes an ease before spiking today, which is similar trajectory to business on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. As such, all movies on New Year's Eve grossed around $28.7M, -38% from Tuesday's estimated $46.4M. 


	Remember, the money made by Stranger Things: Finale, which began yesterday at 5PM EST and runs through today, is concession cash, not box office money. All we know is that two days before opening, 1.1 million seats were sold at 620-plus theaters stateside, which is 700K shy of the 1.7M tickets that Sony/Crunchyroll's Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle had in the bank the Monday before it's opening Friday (why that comp? It's also a fan-driven title, granted non-Netflix).

	











	Exhibitors and distribution heads have nothing to complain about when Christmas and New Year's Day fall on a Thursday: They gain an extra weekend of moviegoing. 


	Here's how the top 10 went down at the domestic box office on New Year's Eve:


	3. Marty Supreme (A24) 2,668 (+2,662) theaters, Wed $2.4M Wk (-44%), Wk $28.1M, Total $38.9M/Wk 2


	4. David (Angel) 2,867 (-251) theaters, Wed $2.375M (-36%), Wk $21.4M, Total $58.5M/Wk 2

Melania Trump rang in the new year alongside husband Donald at a glitzy Mar-a-Lago party Wednesday night, dressed in a silver sequined gown ($1,450) by The New Arrivals.

Along with the shimmering metallic maxi, which she cinched at the waist with a matching belt, the first lady  selected a pair of glittering Christian Louboutin heels.

She wore her highlighted hair parted in the center and arranged in soft, flowing waves for the NYE soirée, where a tuxedoed President Trump — asked by reporters about his 2026 resolution — called for “peace on earth.”

Others in attendance at the Trumps' party included Brett Ratner — the director behind “Melania,” the upcoming Amazon MGM Studios documentary about the first lady.

US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also scored invites.

And Trump's children Donald Jr., Barron and Eric joined as well, with the latter's wife, Lara, dressed in a rose gold sequined gown that coordinated with Melania's.

Mar-a-Lago's New Year's Eve bash is a longstanding tradition of the family's that dates back decades.

In the past — before President Trump's time in the White House — the star-studded shindig's drawn guests including Sylvester Stallone, Tiger Woods, Martha Stewart and Serena Williams.

At last year's event, held just a few weeks before Trump's second inauguration, Melania chose a classic black Versace gown featuring the house's signature gold Medusa hardware at the shoulder.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","‘Mysterious' glowing spiral appears in sky","https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/mysterious-glowing-spiral-appears-sky-36484040","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 18:10:00 GMT","

A driver was left stunned after an eerie glowing spiral mysteriously appeared in the sky. Matt Kipling was heading home when he spotted the bizarre phenomenon.

He was baffled by the lights and managed to record a clip after pulling over while on the A30 near Wadebridge, Cornwall. Matt said: ""It was a mystery I've never seen anything like it.

“I'm not really one for UFOs but it was definitely completely unusual. It was around 6.30pm and I had not long joined the A30 on my way home to Wadebridge.

“It just caught my eye. I pulled the van over in a lay-by and tried to show my mother on FaceTime but unfortunately the phone couldn't pick it up.

""I then took a video and sent it to her, and she also said it was bizarre and had never seen anything like it. “There was no sound.

“There was no street lighting and it was completely pitch black and no houses near by. I had to get back in the van and drive away because I was in a restricted lay-by. I later sent the video to my partner and friends and they were all surprised.”

The incident took place on Christmas Day, but also occurred in 2024. Another local was left stunned by a multicoloured suspected UFO, also in Cornwall. It was filmed hovering over a scenic estuary and was captured on camera by Charlotte Helyer.

The object seemed to change shape as she watched near her family home, with the silent sphere splitting into five separate parts at one point as it floated above the horizon.

Charlotte said: “We saw a really strange series of lights hovering over the hills in the distance. It was at about 11pm. They floated left and right before seeming to reduce into just two balls of white light that floated away miles into the distance. I would say the distance was about six miles but they were very bright.

""I can't explain what they might be. They were too bright to be drones.

“And the way they floated off into the distance means any drone controller would have been out of reach. They also did not return and were completely silent. I have no idea what they were.”

The possible UFO was spotted by Charlotte in July 2024.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","One Of The Best Horror TV Shows Ever Made Has All 15 Seasons Streaming On Prime Video","https://www.looper.com/2061039/best-horror-tv-show-supernatural-streaming-prime-video/","Thu, 01 Jan 2026 11:18:00 GMT","

With ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" ending in 2003 and its spin-off series ""Angel"" wrapping the following year, there was a huge gap for a new horror-infused supernatural drama series to step into by the midpoint of the aughts. In 2005, Eric Kripke filled that gap with ""Supernatural,"" which would run for a whopping 15 seasons and amass a dedicated fanbase along the way. All the seasons were on Netflix for over a decade, but the show has a new streaming home now: Amazon Prime Video.

Led by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, ""Supernatural"" centers on Sam and Dean Winchester, a pair of brothers who make it their business to hunt down creatures of the night — vampires, werewolves, witches, goblins, you name it. But the show is about so much more than just hunting monsters; it's a family tale with deeply religious themes that are sometimes very overt. It's also way more than a regular drama, with lots of romance, tons of laughs, a stinging wit, and some genuine scares for good measure.

""Supernatural"" became somewhat hit and miss over the course of its 15-year lifespan, though when the show does hit, it hits hard. Yes, many of the best ""Supernatural"" episodes are from the early seasons, but the show was still very much worth watching by the time it came to a close. If you're a Prime Video subscriber, this is the perfect winter binge — it will keep you entertained while the weather outside is as frightful as the monsters faced by the Winchesters.

It's safe to say that the ending of ""Supernatural"" was controversial. Fans were divided over how things turned out for the Winchesters, but the creators aren't totally to blame: The latter episodes were shot during the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning some big adjustments had to be made. ""We did a rewrite once we knew what our COVID rules were going to be for episodes 19 and 20,"" co-showrunner Andrew Dabb confirmed to Entertainment Weekly. Several former cast members were initially set to reprise their roles for the finale, but this just wasn't workable under the restrictions imposed during COVID-19, which changed Hollywood forever.

This altered ending has only amplified calls for a ""Supernatural"" revival. While there's nothing official in the works, Jensen Ackles said that he would never say never when he appeared on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"" in 2025. ""I mean, look, it's always hanging out there,"" the actor told Fallon when asked about the chances of the show coming back. ""I think there's a reason we did it for 15 years. We enjoyed it. We enjoyed each other. We enjoyed the story, the characters. It was hard to hang it up, but I don't know that we ever hang it up in 'Supernatural.'""","{'href': 'https://www.looper.com', 'title': 'looper.com'}","other"

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's 'gold card' visa program.

Numerous immigration policy changes were rolled out in 2025, impacting the way people travel, obtain visas and become citizens in the United States. 

Here are five of the biggest changes taking effect: 

The Trump administration unveiled a proposal in September to change how H-1B visas are awarded, a program that has become a cornerstone of the tech industry by allowing U.S. companies to hire highly skilled workers from abroad, including software engineers and data scientists. 

Issued by the Department of Homeland Security, H-1B visas are temporary work permits that have become a vital pathway for U.S. tech companies to recruit global talent.  

The proposal was designed to nudge employers toward offering higher salaries or reserving H-1B petitions for jobs that require advanced skills. The rule change, formally published in the Federal Register, came after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation introducing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications. 

Trump signs an executive order in the Oval Office at the White House on Sept. 19, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Trump signed two executive orders, establishing the ""Trump Gold Card"" and introducing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visas. The ""Trump Gold Card"" is a visa program that allows foreign nationals permanent residency and a pathway to U.S. citizenship for a $1 million investment in the United States.  (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)

DHS said the changes will go into effect in February and are meant to ""better protect the wages, working conditions, and job opportunities for American workers.   

""The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,"" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser said in a statement. 

The Department of Homeland Security implemented a new rule on Dec. 26, 2025, that expands facial recognition for non-citizens who are entering and leaving the United States. 

The DHS said on its website that the rule ""amends existing DHS regulations to authorize U.S. Customs and Border Protection, an operational component within DHS, to collect facial biometrics from all noncitizens upon entry and exit at airports, land ports, seaports, and other authorized points of departure."" 

The rule applies to green card holders and other non-U.S. citizens living legally in the country. 

""Although U.S. citizens are not covered by this rule, they may continue to voluntarily participate in the facial biometrics process at entry and exit,"" the DHS added.

The Department of Homeland Security is moving toward scrutinizing the recent social media histories of foreign travelers before allowing them to enter the United States.   

In a notice filed in December in the Federal Register, U.S. Customs and Border Protection wrote, ""In order to comply with the January 2025 Executive Order 14161 (Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats), CBP is adding social media as a mandatory data element for an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application.""  

""The data element will require ESTA applicants to provide their social media from the last 5 years,"" it added.  

Homeland Security describes ESTA as ""an automated system used to determine the eligibility of visitors to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program and whether such travel poses any law enforcement or security risk."" 

Trump in December announced the launch of the much-anticipated ""Trump Gold Card,"" an immigration initiative designed to provide a new, streamlined path to U.S. citizenship. 

The card, which has a starting price of $1 million, features a portrait of the president, the Statue of Liberty and the American flag underneath a gold background, with ""Trump Gold Card"" stamped on the left side.

""We anticipate THE TRUMP GOLD CARD will generate well over $100 Billion Dollars very quickly,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ""This money will be used for reducing Taxes, Pro Growth Projects, and paying down our Debt.""

Interested parties can apply for the ""exclusive privileges"" on the official website, trumpcard.gov. According to the site, applicants will submit their documents and pay a nonrefundable processing fee, triggering an accelerated probe by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Once an applicant is approved, a Trump Gold Card will be available for use throughout all 50 states and territories. They will be given lawful permanent resident status as an EB-1 or EB-2 visa holder.

A new version of the U.S. citizenship test is requiring applicants to answer twice as many questions as the old one. 

""The 2025 naturalization civics test is an oral test consisting of 20 questions from the list of 128 civics test questions. You must answer 12 questions correctly [60%] to pass the 2025 test. You will fail the test if you answer 9 of the 20 questions incorrectly,"" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said on its website. 

The new test foregoes geographical questions and test-takers will be required to name all three branches of government instead of just one.

""American citizenship is the most sacred citizenship in the world and should only be reserved for aliens who will fully embrace our values and principles as a nation. By ensuring only those aliens who meet all eligibility requirements, including the ability to read, write, and speak English and understand U.S. government and civics, are able to naturalize, the American people can be assured that those joining us as fellow citizens are fully assimilated and will contribute to America's greatness. These critical changes are the first of many,"" USCIS Spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said.

Edited by Vineeta Teotia

 January 01, 2026  

In a systematic review and meta-analysis, weight-loss interventions demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in psoriasis severity and quality of life of patients.

""Weight-loss interventions may improve skin disease and quality of life for people with psoriasis and excess weight,"" the authors wrote, suggesting that ""clinicians should consider using these findings to counsel patients and refer them for weight-loss support when appropriate.""

This study was led by Sarah Morrow, Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, England. It was published online on December 19, 2025, in the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology & Venereology.

The findings were limited by the small number of patients for some outcomes. Pooled behavioural interventions varied in intensity, duration, and delivery, contributing to weight-loss variability and high heterogeneity. Differences in study populations also likely contributed to the observed heterogeneity. Additionally, no trials were conducted in primary or community care settings, where populations might differ from those recruited in specialist dermatology settings. The long-term sustainability of psoriasis improvement after weight loss remained unclear due to generally short study follow-ups, with only two studies conducting extended follow-up.

This study was jointly funded by the British Skin Foundation and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR); additional support was provided by the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre. One author reported receiving research grants from the British Skin Foundation. Three authors reported receiving research grants from the NIHR.
