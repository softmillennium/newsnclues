                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Have you ever looked back at a crypto's past price and thought, “I wish I had bought it when it was cheap”? The best altcoins for next bull run are already making moves, and those who spot them early could secure life-changing gains. With institutional interest surging and major upgrades coming to key projects, some altcoins are gearing up for a game-changing rally. One of the biggest names making waves right now is Qubetics, a powerful Web3 aggregator designed to unify major blockchains. Its game-changing approach to cross-border transactions and its fast-moving presale have made it one of the best altcoins for the next bull run. Several other cryptos are also primed for serious growth, thanks to their groundbreaking technology and increasing adoption. Let's dive into these six altcoins that won't stay under the radar for long. Qubetics is shaking up the financial world by making international transactions faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Imagine sending money across the globe in seconds without relying on outdated SWIFT networks or costly remittance services. This Web3 aggregator seamlessly connects multiple blockchains, creating a frictionless experience for global transactions. Banks and financial institutions are already eyeing its potential to replace outdated cross-border payment methods. This real-world utility cements its place among the best altcoins for next bull run. Qubetics is gaining serious momentum and positioning itself as one of the best altcoins for next bull run.

Why This Coin Made It to This List: With scalability at its core and strong developer adoption, Near Protocol is a sleeping giant in the making. Toncoin is emerging as one of the most promising Layer-1 blockchains, thanks to its deep integration with Telegram. With Telegram's massive global user base, TON has the potential to onboard millions into crypto seamlessly. As Telegram expands its crypto capabilities, Toncoin's value proposition becomes even stronger. Why This Coin Made It to This List: With one of the largest social media platforms backing it, TON has the network effect to drive widespread adoption.

The best altcoins for next bull run won't just be hype-driven—they'll have real-world applications, strong ecosystems, and high user adoption. Qubetics, Polkadot, ICP, Near Protocol, Toncoin, and Zignaly each bring something unique to the table, making them prime candidates for massive growth. With the Qubetics presale offering a rare chance to get in early, those who join this best crypto presale now could be sitting on some of the biggest gains in the next market cycle. The best altcoins for the next bull run include Qubetics, Polkadot, Internet Computer Protocol, Near Protocol, Toncoin, and Zignaly due to their strong fundamentals and increasing adoption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) proponent Michael Saylor has hinted the company he co-founded, Strategy (MSTR), may be set to announce an additional BTC purchase this week shortly after revealing it expects a net loss in the first quarter of the year over unrealized losses on its massive BTC holdings. The company has added 80,785 BTC to its balance sheet since the beginning of the year after raising a total of $7.69 billion during the first quarter, with over half of that coming from common stock sales. Most, if not all, of those funds were used to buy bitcoin. On Sunday, Saylor posted a BTC holdings tracker to X, a move that typically precedes a purchase announcement, commenting there are “no tariffs on orange dots.” The comment implies the company's BTC purchases were unaffected by the reciprocal tariffs Donald Trump introduced earlier this month and the ensuing U.S.-China trade war. No Tariffs on Orange Dots pic.twitter.com/Cg3bCVPMcM Its crypto stash is currently worth roughly $44.59 billion, and was acquired for $35.63 billion. Strategy currently holds 528,185 BTC bought at an average price of $67,458 according to Bitcointreasuries data equivalent to 2.515% of the cryptocurrency's total supply.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A longtime Silicon Valley power broker and associate of Elon Musk, Sacks rallied the tech elite to back Trump's return to the White House. In an interview with The Post, Sacks described his new role as “being a bit of a bridge” between Silicon Valley and Washington. Sacks's influence was notable from Trump's first week in office, when the president unveiled a pair of executive orders on crypto and AI. Tech elites have pinned their hopes on Sacks, banking on him to encourage unfettered growth in AI and to carve out clear rules of the road for crypto. In recent days, as global markets reacted to Trump's tariff plan and Musk traded barbs with administration advisers, Sacks initially remained focused on his purview, touting from his White House X account new rules to benefit stablecoins. Sacks defended Trump's tariffs strategy on Friday's episode of “All-In.” After Larry Summers, treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, unfavorably compared the U.S. economy to that of Argentina, Sacks countered that Trump had given America “extraordinary leverage over virtually every country in the world.” Amid economic uncertainty, critics fear that Sacks, who was heavily invested in crypto before divesting for his White House role, will usher in an industry-led free-for-all, leaving consumers vulnerable to scams and volatility. “There's no reason to think that he won't be bringing a view that is ‘corporations first' as opposed to America or Americans first,” said Rick Claypool, research director of Public Citizen, a money-in-politics watchdog group. Crypto companies are surging, buoyed by the new administration. In Congress, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee) steered a bill to legitimize stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to the dollar — through a committee that rejected the proposal under President Joe Biden. Agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have made it easier for banks to work with crypto companies by pledging to not focus on a bank's “reputational risk.” “The SEC staff make their own decisions about enforcement actions,” a spokesperson for Sacks said. Hosting crypto executives for a White House summit last month, Trump pledged to end Biden's “war on crypto” as Sacks marveled at the swift turnaround. It's really amazing,” he said, turning to the president. “It's actually faster than any start-up that I've been part of.” Sacks has long stood out in Silicon Valley for his conservative bent and his ties to self-proclaimed “PayPal Mafia” iconoclasts such as Peter Thiel and Musk. Born in Cape Town, South Africa, Sacks came to the United States as a child in the late 1970s when his family immigrated to Tennessee. He met Thiel as a student at Stanford University and with him co-wrote the 1995 book “The Diversity Myth,” a polemic against political correctness on college campuses that anticipated central concerns of conservative politics today. “He's earned a lot of street cred for being a voice for this extremely libertarian ideology when it was not in vogue,” said Niki Christoff, a D.C.-based consultant who previously worked in public policy for Salesforce, Uber and Google. After the company was acquired by eBay in 2002, early employees, including Musk, parlayed their fortunes into building powerful companies such as defense contractor Palantir. His firm Craft Ventures focused on business software but took stakes in Musk's companies, including SpaceX, and a handful of AI and crypto start-ups. After the coronavirus shuttered San Francisco, Sacks and his venture capitalist “besties” started “All-In,” talking for hours each week about business, investing and, increasingly, politics. Sacks was initially a punchy conservative foil to his centrist co-hosts, who like many in tech had historically backed Democrats. He argued that the U.S. should not support Ukraine's fight against Russia and called for government protections for depositors after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. “They were thinking out loud together, bringing ‘All-In' listeners along for the ride,” said a person close to the White House, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment. The “All-In” crew endorsed Musk's claims that liberal tech companies quashed free speech and cheered his mass firings at Twitter, where Sacks assisted Musk's takeover. When the 2024 presidential race  began, Sacks helped launch Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's campaign, co-hosting him and Musk in a conversation streamed on Twitter. Meanwhile, “All-In” hosted independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Republican contender Vivek Ramaswamy — whom Sacks also held fundraisers for — as well as Democrat Dean Phillips. When Trump joined the show in June, he sounded like one of the besties when he explained that the U.S. must double or triple the capacity of its electric grid to compete with China in AI, a realization Trump said he had “at David's house and talking to a lot of geniuses from Silicon Valley.” Sacks was influential in lobbying Trump to pick JD Vance, a protégé of Thiel, for vice president, The Post has reported. Like Musk, Sacks is a “special government employee,” exempt from certain disclosure rules and only permitted to work for the federal government for 130 days a year. “Sacks is staying within that limit by alternating weeks working for the White House and working in the Bay Area,” a spokesperson said. “He's Team America,” said entrepreneur Trevor Traina, who attended Sacks's fundraiser and was ambassador to Austria in Trump's first term. “An incredibly wealthy guy with a beautiful lifestyle and all that, who doesn't have to be running at full tilt but who chooses to do so.” Three days before Trump's inauguration, the president-elect underscored that his interest in crypto was also personal. While Sacks co-hosted the Crypto Ball, a jubilant black-tie affair in D.C., Trump promoted a crypto coin called $TRUMP, launched by companies with ties to his family. Crypto insiders recognized it as a meme coin, designed to ride online hype. Some became concerned that the “crypto president” might be prioritizing his own portfolio. Trump seemed to be “acting almost as a crypto entrepreneur, which we don't need,” said Nic Carter, founding partner of the investment firm Castle Island Ventures. Political watchdogs have also raised questions about Sacks's crypto holdings. Sacks pushed back, revealing in sharp X posts that he had voluntarily divested many of his crypto holdings and related investments months earlier. Trump's czar appeared to have smoothed over the controversy. Yet Sacks may still be asked to lend credibility “to whatever wacky plan a bunch of barbarians have come up with,” the person added. Silicon Valley executives whom Sacks has called for advice on White House business say he is energized by the challenges of Washington bureaucracy. Sacks came across more like a sober student of government than a DOGE disciple when he summed up his first few weeks in D.C. on an episode of “All-In.” Sacks described a news conference where the chairs of four House and Senate committees pledged to pass crypto legislation by year's end.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company continues to buy Bitcoin amid the recent economic downturn that has negatively impacted markets and left investors uncertain. Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor has signaled that the company plans to acquire more Bitcoin (BTC) following a nearly two-week pause in purchases. The company's most recent acquisition of 22,048 Bitcoin on March 31 brought its total holdings to 528,185 BTC. According to SaylorTracker, Strategy's BTC investment is up by approximately 24%, representing over $8.6 billion in unrealized gains. Strategy continues to accumulate BTC amid the recent market downturn that took Bitcoin's price below the $80,000 level, and the company continues to be closely monitored by BTC investors as a barometer for institutional interest in BTC. Related: Has Michael Saylor's Strategy built a house of cards? Stock markets wiped away trillions in shareholder value in response to Trump's sweeping tariff order, and crypto markets also experienced a deep sell-off. By comparison, BTC is only down roughly 22% from its peak of over $109,000 in January 2025 and is currently rangebound, trading around the $84,000 level. Speaking with Cointelegraph at Paris Blockchain Week 2025, Cypherpunk and CEO of digital asset infrastructure company Blockstream, Adam Back said the macroeconomic pressures from a prolonged trade war would make Bitcoin an increasingly attractive store of value. Back forecasted inflation to surge to 10-15% in the next decade, making real investment returns on traditional asset classes such as stocks and real estate incredibly difficult for market participants. "There is a real prospect of Bitcoin competing with gold and then starting to take some of the gold use cases,” Back told Cointelegraph managing editor Gareth Jenkinson.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy may have resumed its Bitcoin purchases after a one-week break. Michael Saylor, the company's executive chairman, posted the Bitcoin tracker on X on Sunday, a move that typically hints at an upcoming purchase announcement. Saylor's tweet comes after Strategy reported approximately $6 billion in unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings during Q1 2025. The company acquired 80,715 BTC in the quarter at an average price of about $94,922 per coin, during which Bitcoin prices fell nearly 12% in its worst quarterly performance since 2018. Strategy temporarily halted Bitcoin purchases in the week ending April 6 due to a lack of stock offering purchases for its MSTR and STRK securities. The company has invested about $35 billion in Bitcoin at an average price of $67,485 per coin, resulting in roughly $8.6 billion in unrealized gains. Its most recent purchase, announced on March 31, added 22,048 Bitcoin worth $1.9 billion, bringing its total holdings to 528,185 BTC – nearly 3% of Bitcoin's total supply. The holdings are currently valued at around $44 billion. Bitcoin has experienced volatility this week, falling below $75,000 on Monday before recovering above $80,000 amid rising US-China trade tensions. The digital asset trades at approximately $83,700 today, showing a slight decline over the past 24 hours, per TradingView.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Widely followed crypto analyst Rekt Capital says that Bitcoin (BTC) is displaying textbook pre-rally behavior as technical indicators and price action flash green. Overall, throughout the cycle, Bitcoin has formed Bullish Divergences like this on a few occasions already. Each Bull Div preceded reversals to the upside.” Zooming in, the analyst says that BTC's downward trend is officially broken once a clean break of the lower high structure, currently at around $82,000, occurs. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $84,789, slightly above Rekt Capital's blue, downward trend line depicted in the chart, suggesting that the reversal may be underway.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A proposed piece of legislation, introduced by Assemblyman Clyde Vanel, aims to update existing laws so that various state departments can accept cryptocurrency as a valid form of payment. Known as Assembly Bill A7788, the proposal outlines how New Yorkers could use select cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash—to settle government-related costs. These include taxes, penalties, fees, and even rent owed to public agencies. However, this fee cannot be more than the actual cost of processing the transaction, such as blockchain fees or third-party processor charges. Another bill, A06515, was introduced earlier to crack down on crypto-related fraud and deceptive schemes like rug pulls, signaling a broader effort by lawmakers to both regulate and embrace blockchain technologies. His campaign promised stronger support for crypto innovation, which has encouraged multiple states to explore integration strategies. If it gains approval and clears the state Senate, New York could become a trailblazer by enabling crypto payments for government obligations. Japan is preparing to reshape its crypto regulations with a fresh proposal that would divide digital assets into two distinct categories—one for business-backed tokens and another for decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Lomond School in Scotland is set to make history as the first educational institution in the United Kingdom to accept Bitcoin for tuition payments, marking a significant step in the broader adoption of digital assets in traditional sectors. Concerns over the unchecked rise of cryptocurrencies have prompted New York Attorney General Letitia James to call on Congress for immediate intervention. Your Email address will not be published.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The shift from hype to real-world applications is becoming clear. For investors focused on long-term value, this creates rare opportunities. They often reflect a cooling-off period where serious projects build while noise fades. One project gaining quiet traction during this reset is Dawgz AI. It runs on Ethereum and blends meme culture with on-chain AI features. While many tokens slow down, Dawgz AI continues to build tools and grow its user base. According to Security.org, about 28% of adults, or roughly 65 million individuals, own cryptocurrencies in the United States alone. This widespread adoption is not limited to individual users; institutions also embrace blockchain. The global blockchain market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 58.3%, reaching $306 billion by 2030. This growth is driven by increased demand for decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized real-world assets, and enterprise applications.​ As blockchain becomes more integrated into different sectors, investors seek projects offering real utility and long-term potential. Rising blockchain adoption has brought more visibility to promising projects, but not all tokens are built for long-term relevance. A fixed token supply, verified smart contracts, and third-party audits help build trust. You can track this through public GitHub repositories or network upgrades. Dawgz AI, for example, continues to build and engage while adoption expands, making it a project worth watching. Instead, it introduces on-chain AI integrations designed to support real use. This includes AI-backed tools to give users better control their interactions with markets and blockchain-based applications. As blockchain adoption increases, Dawgz AI continues to grow its user base and roll out updates. It hosts regular engagement campaigns such as meme contests and open development discussions. These signs point to a project focused on building rather than chasing attention. Ethereum remains the most widely used innovative contract platform in crypto. While the current price is down from recent highs, Ethereum continues to support thousands of decentralized applications across sectors like finance, identity, and gaming. Ethereum's Layer 2 networks have also gained adoption as developers look for cheaper ways to deploy on-chain logic. These factors give it staying power and support strong investor interest during downturns. Despite volatility, Ethereum remains a core holding for many who believe in the future of on-chain systems. The project has partnered with major financial firms and blockchain platforms. It remains one of the few utility tokens with enterprise backing and consistent developer traction. The rise in blockchain adoption has created space for tokens that mix functionality with culture. Investors are starting to pay closer attention to projects that are built during downturns and offer something users can actually interact with. These projects tend to survive shifts in market cycles. Built on Ethereum, it combines meme-driven community appeal with on-chain AI tools. These tools are designed to support users with real-time decision-making and automation, not just token speculation. The token has a fixed supply of 8.888 billion, and its smart contract is publicly available. A third-party audit from SolidProof was completed to help build early trust. With regular updates, meme contests, and community engagement, Dawgz AI is positioning itself as a project that doesn't just participate in hype but builds through it. One practical strategy is dollar-cost averaging (DCA), which spreads investment across multiple entries rather than guessing the bottom. Teams that continue development, share updates, and engage during slow markets often signal a long-term focus. When researching newer tokens, also track wallet movement, presale metrics, and audit status. If you're exploring the best crypto to buy in the dip, start with assets that still show purpose and transparency when others go quiet. These projects are usually still building for the cycle ahead, not just reacting to it. It's happening during a period of steady blockchain growth. That makes timing more than just a price play—it's about choosing active, accountable, and positioned tokens for long-term use. Dawgz AI is one of the few meme tokens quietly building during this phase. Look for signs of active development, transparent tokenomics, and consistent community engagement. Projects like Dawgz AI that continue building and communicating during downturns tend to attract long-term interest. Start with research and use risk management strategies like dollar-cost averaging. Tokens such as Dawgz AI, which offer public audits and clear supply structures, add another layer of accountability. It brings real use cases to the market, from finance to digital tools, creating long-term demand for the infrastructure and tokens supporting it. Dawgz AI is part of this shift, using AI-powered features to add utility beyond speculation. Yes, if you focus on projects with strong fundamentals and long-term potential. Dawgz AI is an example of a token that gained traction by building during slower market phases rather than waiting for the next bull run.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Do not sell or share my personal information. This new technology marks a unique opportunity for crypto enthusiasts. It usually takes a ton of energy to operate, but Algorand — a digital currency developed in 2017 — changed a key part of the technology, according to Blockchain Magazine. It's OK if you're unfamiliar with the language around this stuff or how it all works. What Algorand did was simplify how users interact with the blockchain when buying or selling Algorand currency. The result is a crypto coin that requires drastically less energy to keep up and running, Blockchain Magazine reported. Since much of the electric grid system still relies on burning dirty fuel sources to make energy, the Algorand solution is a win for keeping the planet cool and clean for us humans to live on. It also marks a unique opportunity for crypto enthusiasts, as more businesses are starting to lean on Algorand to power sustainable finance, the outlet explained. Despite weathering volatility during economic shifts, crypto owners frequently celebrate many coins as forms of money that operate in some ways more securely — and often less hierarchically — than traditional financial accounts. However, the world of cryptocurrency still has a long way to go to minimize its strain on the grid and environmental impact. Some critics also argue that Algorand's way of doing crypto is less secure and more centralized than the usual way things work. Others maintain that Algorand's system could change the whole crypto landscape and be a real competitor to other popular coins, such as Ethereum, which switched to a less energy-intensive "proof of stake" model in 2022. "If the industry continues to prioritize sustainability, Algorand will be a benchmark for future blockchain networks." Do you think EVs will dominate our roads in 15 years?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's now deeply tied to global policy and infrastructure strategy. In April 2025, the Trump administration imposed sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports, but spared smartphones and computers, signaling that critical digital infrastructure is off-limits – even in trade wars. In this shifting landscape, investors are flocking to Solaxy ($SOLX), the first Solana Layer 2 built to fix congestion, scale with demand, and bridge Ethereum's massive DeFi liquidity. UK finance minister Rachel Reeves has called for an “ambitious new relationship” with the EU, signaling efforts to strengthen economic ties with Britain's biggest trading partner. As US tariffs add pressure globally, the UK is clearly prioritizing long-term digital infrastructure. Despite tariffs reaching up to 125% on many Chinese goods, smartphones and computers were exempted – underscoring the importance of protecting core technology. As blockchain moves into the mainstream, clunky, isolated platforms are no longer enough. Solaxy ($SOLX) is a new crypto project that fits this global model. It's the first Layer 2 built on Solana, solving the chain's long-standing issues like congestion and failed transactions, while keeping its biggest strengths: speed and low fees. As global priorities shift toward protecting and scaling digital infrastructure, Solaxy stands out – not as a niche tool for traders, but as a foundational layer for the future of crypto. It eliminates congestion, failed transactions, and scalability limits, while enhancing the chain's key strengths: speed, low fees, and user efficiency. That means it connects the largest DeFi and asset tokenization ecosystem on Ethereum with the high-speed trading playground of Solana. Traders no longer have to choose between liquidity and performance – they get both. It gives everyday traders sniper-level speed and reliability without the usual tech barriers. With most Layer 2 tokens now valued over $1B, Solaxy is emerging as the market leader in a space Solana never had until now. $SOLX is built for accessibility and massive reach. By bridging Ethereum's liquidity with Solana's speed, $SOLX doesn't just expand access – it exponentially increases its own buyer pool, positioning itself as a true gateway to multichain DeFi. As governments and investors alike get serious about digital infrastructure, the crypto world needs solutions that are fast, scalable, and built for the multichain future. Solaxy checks every box – and with $SOLX still in presale, smart investors are moving fast to grab their share of what could be the most important Layer 2 launch of the year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum surprised the market with a powerful bounce on Wednesday, surging more than 21% from its recent low of $1,380. The move came shortly after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China, which now faces a 145% tariff. This development injected optimism into global markets, triggering a broad recovery across risk assets — with ETH among the top beneficiaries. Despite the relief rally, Ethereum still trades below critical technical levels, and the broader price structure suggests ongoing consolidation rather than a confirmed reversal. However, on-chain data from CryptoQuant adds an intriguing layer to the current outlook. Historically, this scenario has represented a high-probability accumulation zone, often appearing once per cycle. According to some analysts, this could present a rare buying opportunity for contrarian investors willing to look beyond short-term volatility and macro uncertainty. Ethereum is at a pivotal point after enduring weeks of relentless selling pressure and extreme volatility. The broader market has been shaken by macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating global trade tensions, with US tariffs under Trump's administration continuing to rattle investor confidence. Bulls are beginning to reappear, with Ethereum bouncing and setting a strong support above $1,400. This recovery follows aggressive price swings not only in crypto but also in global equities, which have seen significant rebounds following the announcement of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China. According to top analyst Quinten Francois, ETH is currently trading under its realized price, which averages the cost basis of all coins in circulation. Francois suggests this might be a once-in-a-cycle — or even once-in-a-lifetime — chance for long-term investors to accumulate ETH at undervalued levels. The coming days will determine whether bulls can reclaim key resistance and shift sentiment toward a sustained recovery. Ethereum is currently trading at $1,650 after failing to break above the $1,700 level, a psychological and technical barrier that continues to cap bullish momentum. Despite a sharp rebound earlier in the week, ETH remains stuck in a consolidation range and is struggling to find direction amid broader market uncertainty. For bulls to regain control and initiate a stronger recovery, Ethereum must push above the $1,850 mark — a level aligned with the 4-hour 200-day moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA). These indicators have acted as short-term resistance since ETH fell below the $2,000 mark in February and reclaiming them is critical for confirming a shift in trend. However, if Ethereum fails to break above $1,750 in the coming days, downside risk increases significantly. This would put further pressure on bulls and undermine recent gains. With market sentiment still fragile and macroeconomic uncertainty weighing on investor confidence, Ethereum remains at a crucial juncture where a decisive move above resistance is needed to shift the outlook from bearish to neutral.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We at Cryptonomist were present at the Paris Blockchain Week, where a high-level panel was held dedicated to the future of artificial intelligence in synergy with blockchain technology. A heated discussion, rich in technical and ethical insights, highlighted the opportunities and contradictions of this technological convergence. Taking the stage were Amelia Daly, Kevin Riou, Claudio Bedino, Ethan Pierse, and Aymen Soufi, five industry experts who offered complementary and in-depth perspectives on how to tackle the mass adoption of blockchain thanks to artificial intelligence. The panel opened with a surprising reflection: every interaction with ChatGPT or similar costs about 0.46 dollars. A figure that includes energy consumption, computing power, and the infrastructure necessary to generate real-time responses. This cost does not fall on the end user, especially if they use free versions. The user, in exchange for free access, gives up valuable information that is processed, stored, and often monetized. Precisely in this context, the blockchain comes into play, seen as a tool for privacy protection and returning control to users. One of the speakers emphasized how, through tokenization and decentralized architectures, it is possible to break the monopoly of big tech, which today hold enormous amounts of personal data. AI and blockchain together can create new models of information governance, in which the user decides how, when, and with whom to share their data. Not only in the financial sector, but also in sensitive areas such as health, education, and energy consumption. A hot topic of the panel was the energy required for artificial intelligence, often compared to that of blockchain. While in past years Bitcoin and other Proof-of-Work projects have been targeted for high consumption, today AI uses even greater amounts of electricity, without facing the same wave of criticism. “We spend years justifying the energy use of mining and now no one discusses the climate cost of memes generated by ChatGPT”, observed one of the speakers. The blockchain was created as a disintermediation technology, where each user is responsible for their own keys and decisions. But what happens if we delegate these choices to an agentic AI, capable of signing transactions or managing wallets? Despite these critical issues, all panel participants recognized the enormous potential of AI as a support tool. From energy consumption forecasts to optimized asset management, intelligenza artificiale can simplify users' lives and increase the accuracy of decisions. “AI must help humans make decisions, not make them in their place”, stated one of the panelists, emphasizing that the correct approach is one of collaboration, not substitution. However, it was also reiterated that the current AI agents are still primitive. Most are limited to speculative operations like trading, often ineffectively. The challenge is to develop more sophisticated, contextual, and controllable models. The combination of AI and blockchain offers extraordinary possibilities, but also requires attention, ethics, and conscious design.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home » India's Assam Embraces AI and Blockchain to Revolutionize Tea Trade India, recognized as the world's second-largest tea producer after China, is preparing to implement a blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled auction system aimed at increasing transparency and enhancing efficiency within its tea industry. This upcoming digital system is expected to reshape the traditional auction model by facilitating secure transactions and promoting equitable pricing structures. Assam contributes more than half of India's total tea output, making its role in this technological transformation particularly significant. The proposed digital auction platform is intended to provide a trustworthy environment for both buyers and sellers, while minimizing price manipulation and reducing the scope for fraudulent practices. Despite Assam's reputation for producing high-quality tea, the existing auction framework has faced criticism due to limited transparency and inefficiencies. By adopting blockchain technology, the state aims to create a decentralized and tamper-proof record of transactions, while the use of AI will help analyze market trends, optimize auction timings, and improve decision-making processes. By offering data-driven insights and secure interactions, the initiative is designed to provide equal access to market opportunities, thereby supporting inclusive growth within the tea sector. Assam's broader technology-driven development strategy also includes plans for India's first AI-based anti-deepfake and cyber surveillance laboratory. The state government intends to equip the Assam Police with advanced tools to combat emerging digital threats, enhance cybersecurity, and improve digital forensics capabilities. This transition involves the use of geospatial technology for accurate land valuation and the integration of blockchain into NGDRS to enable secure and faster property transactions. India's tea sector has been under pressure due to recent climate-related disruptions. The decline, caused by heat waves and flooding during critical harvesting periods, contributed to a spike in prices. The average tea price in 2024 rose by nearly 18%, reaching ₹198.76 ($2.32) per kilogram. Increased demand from countries such as the UAE, Iraq, and Russia contributed to this growth. India primarily exports CTC (crush-tear-curl) teas to markets like Egypt and the United Kingdom, while the orthodox variety finds buyers in Iraq, Iran, and Russia. By integrating AI and blockchain into its most vital industries, Assam is positioning itself as a leader in digital innovation. These advancements are not only expected to strengthen the state's economy but also serve as a blueprint for similar transformations across other Indian states and sectors. Two major developments in blockchain technology have highlighted the evolving commitment of key players to both scalability and futureproofing, with... * DISCLAIMER: All information provided in CoinTrust is merely for informational purposes, we are not an investment advisor and not affiliated with any companies or ICO/Cryptocurrency Projects.
