                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio said on Sunday that he is worried that the turmoil resulting from President Donald Trump's tariff and economic policies will threaten the global economy. "Right now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession," Dalio said on NBC News' "Meet the Press." "And I'm worried about something worse than a recession if this isn't handled well." The hedge fund billionaire said he's more concerned about trade disruptions, mounting U.S. debt and emerging world powers bringing down the international economic and geopolitical structure that has been in place since the end of World War II. "We are going from multilateralism, which is largely an American world order type of thing, to a unilateral world order in which there's great conflict," he said. Dalio said five forces drive history: the economy, internal political conflict, the international order, technology and acts of nature such as floods and pandemics. Trump's tariffs have understandable goals, Dalio said, but they are being implemented in a "very disruptive" way that creates global conflict. The president's rapidly changing tariff policies have upended international trade. Then, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced an exemption from the reciprocal tariffs for Chinese-made consumer electronics like smartphones, computers and semiconductors late Friday, though the products remain subject to a 20% tariff imposed earlier in the year. But Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick backtracked on Sunday and said the exemption was not permanent. He also called for both countries to address their growing debts. Dalio on "Meet the Press" said on Sunday that Congress should reduce the federal deficit to 3% of gross domestic product, echoing comments he made at CNBC's CONVERGE LIVE event in March. "If they don't, we're going to have a supply-demand problem for debt at the same time as we have these other problems, and the results of that will be worse than a normal recession," Dalio said. The very value of money is at stake, Dalio said. PRO: Watch CNBC's full interview with Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

"They're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two," Lutnick said on ABC News' "This Week." "So this is not like a permanent sort of exemption. [Trump's] just clarifying that these are not available to be negotiated away by countries," he said. Lutnick's comments throw cold water on hopes that popular tech products made in China, such as computers, laptops, smartphones, and flat-panel TVs, would be spared from Trump's 145% reciprocal tariffs — duties that raise prices for U.S. importers and are generally passed on to consumers. They also add more confusion about Trump's tariff policy, which has changed repeatedly. Democratic lawmakers on Sunday said the changes are causing "chaos" and a "crisis of credibility" for Trump. A 20% tariff on all Chinese goods remains in effect. Lutnick on Sunday emphasized that the U.S. "can't be beholden and rely upon foreign countries for fundamental things that we need." U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, in an attempt to clarify why the exemptions were made, said Sunday that they are "not really an exception," even though the executive order Trump signed concerning the exemptions is titled in part "Clarification of Exceptions." The reciprocal tariff exemptions initially had brought a sigh of relief for major tech companies, including Apple, which manufactures most of its products in China. But Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said the confusion sowed by the Trump administration's reversal late Friday on reciprocal tariffs on some electronics from China — and his sudden call on Wednesday for a 90-day pause in enforcing new tariffs on other countries — is harmful to the U.S. "President Trump now has a crisis in credibility," he said in an interview Sunday on NBC News' "Meet the Press."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Last week, that fundamental "flight to safety" approach didn't work. A surge in U.S. treasury bond yields sparked questions about the fundamental role of bonds in a diversified portfolio, and even bigger questions about whether an unprecedented shift away from the U.S. treasuries market and U.S. dollar could be underway. Managing bond maturities had already become increasingly difficult for investors in a world of rapid interest rate swings and inflation as the Fed transitioned from an era of ultra-low interest rates to major rate hikes to fight inflation. But there's another concept used by financial advisors and wealth planning firms for decades that investing experts say can work for investors seeking shelter in the market storm that has hit both stocks and bonds as a result of President Trump's trade war: the bond ladder. The goal of a bond ladder is to invest in a wide range of treasury maturities, hold them all to maturity, and provide regular income, in the form of principal and interest, on a monthly basis. Many financial advisors and wealth management firms continue to offer this strategy on a custom basis, but it is a lot of work and often reserved for high net worth clients. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) brings the same approach into an ETF at a reasonable cost (an expense ratio of 0.25%, or 25 basis points), investing in treasuries, from 30-day issues to 10-year bonds, and has a fixed monthly income distributing roughly 11% to investors, through 2035. In a sense, for investors familiar with the target-date fund approach that is timed to invest in a manner that meets the life needs of an investor as they age, and who also understand the concept of annuities, this bond ladder ETF brings similar approaches to fixed-income personal finance. It provides monthly income with a decades-long horizon. "When you buy a bond you know exactly what you're going to get," Nate Conrad, head of the LifeX mutual fund franchise at Stone Ridge Asset Management, said on CNBC's "ETF Edge" last Wednesday. Independent ETF expert Dave Nadig says the bond ladder strategy is a safe bet in an agitated bond market because even as treasury prices and yields swing, it should not matter to the investor holding this kind of fund for regular income needs. "You need to understand that when things happen like what's going on in the market right now where we have the bond market selloff, the net asset value of these is going to come down and that's going to be a shocker," Nadig said. "That's completely normal and you should not care because the point of this is holding it to completion, holding it to maturity. They are, to be blunt, very boring in construction, and I'm a big fan of boring when it's delivering an actual pattern of returns that investors need." What you do care about, he said:  "Peace of mind in a really tough time." Most investors have opted for another approach to dealing with the recent bond market stress, leaning on ultrashort fixed-income bond ETFs. Mike Akins, founding partner at ETF Action, says ultrashort ETFs have become akin to money market funds for some investors. "Ultrashort is far and away where you're getting most of the money," Akins said, with the recent data showing over 90% of bond ETF flows into the ultrashort category, which includes the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL). But Nadig says the bond ladder can serve a broader goal. "It's really about protecting the buying power here," he said. "This is about immunization from liabilities," he added. For any investor worried about mortgages, second properties, and college payments, "you take that cash flow and put it out of mind. Of course, no strategy is entirely without risk. In a world of hyper-inflation, there is no way to guarantee any investment can preserve buying power. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Sunday that "right now," there are not any plans for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to speak. The recent exemptions are being presented domestically as Trump is backing down and further evidence that Chinese supply chains are not easily replaceable by U.S. companies. "Public opinion widely views this as another retreat by the U.S. government on its tariff policies," the official Beijing Daily wrote. On China's popular social media platform Weibo, the hashtag "Trump administration retreats again" ranked No. The Trump administration late Friday exempted some widely used tech devices and components, including smartphones, computers, semiconductors, solar cells and flash drives, from reciprocal tariffs, according to guidance from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The move was viewed as a major win for tech giants, including Apple, which manufacture many products in China. — CNBC's Eunice Yoon contributed to this report Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, I was convinced I could plan a trip to win him over if only he'd give me a chance. Earlier this year, we finally went together — and he loved it. When I travel to Disney World for work, I'm always on the go, chasing stories and trying to cram in as many experiences as possible. That means my meals are usually quick Dole Whips and pretzels while standing in line. However, to win Trent over, I decided to slow down and indulge in some of Disney World's best dining. We visited at least one sit-down restaurant a day and stayed far away from character dining and buffets, where the food is usually an afterthought. One of our favorite meals was at Sanaa, where we got the world-famous bread service and then watched animals roaming the safari at Animal Kingdom Lodge. For about an hour, a knowledgeable scientist took us on a small group tour of all the greenhouses, and we learned about the innovative ways Disney grows food and manages pests. Although the tour isn't adults-only, the subject matter might be a little dry for little ones — and we didn't see many kids here when we went. If you're on an adults-only trip, this tour could be a great way to get a break from the screaming toddlers around the parks. It's no secret that World Showcase is the best place for 21-and-over fun at Disney World, and Trent and I definitely ordered a few drinks from the different pavilions. However, as history buffs, we also enjoyed touring World Showcase beyond the food and drinks. I love being at the parks from open to close, but I knew Trent would get burned out if we attempted that. So I followed the advice I usually give parents with little kids: Take a midday break back at the hotel. We'd nap, grab drinks at the pool bar, and even read in a hammock. Coronado Springs Resort has a sangria class on weekends where you get to sample different types of sangria and concoct your own. We also bar-hopped around Disney Springs with friends and went to the BoardWalk area's dueling piano bar, Jellyrolls, with some of my coworkers. (Jellyrolls is set to close later this month, unfortunately). I really liked sharing my favorite secret spots in Disney with Trent, who also doesn't do well in crowds. Having some spaces all to ourselves at Disney World made the experience more magical. Because Trent experiences severe motion sickness, we couldn't do too many rides. Haunted Mansion and Spaceship Earth were OK, but even something like Soarin' or Rise of the Resistance would've been too much for him. Instead, we simply walked around and enjoyed the theming of each park. We also spent a lot of time watching shows — and there are a lot of good ones at Disney.</p>

King and Woolard came up with three key elements to success: "Those are the three things that I hope will help anybody at any age, but particularly young people," King says. To King's point of continual learning, the 81-year-old recently re-enrolled in college to earn the history degree she started more than 60 years ago; King left college in 1964 to pursue her tennis career, but now she's back to hitting the books as part of California State University L.A.'s Class of 2026. King says she'd been thinking about finishing her degree for many years and figured now was the time to finally do it. History-making game-changers, after all, inspire her to greatness. King considers Althea Gibson, who in 1950 became the first Black tennis player to compete in the U.S. National Championships and had a storied career, an early inspiration. King continues to be inspired by women athletes paving the future of women's sports today, she says: "I look at all of them and realize how hard they must have worked just to get where they are."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Russia and Ukraine's top diplomats on Saturday used a high-level conference in Turkey to once again trade accusations of violating a tentative U.S.-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges of negotiating an end to the 3-year-old war. The two foreign ministers spoke at separate events at the annual Antalya Diplomacy Forum, a day after U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss peace prospects. Ukraine's European allies on Friday promised billions of dollars to help Kyiv keep fighting Russia's invasion. While Moscow and Kyiv both agreed in principle last month to implement a limited, 30-day ceasefire, they issued conflicting statements soon after their separate talks with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia. "The Ukrainians have been attacking us from the very beginning, every passing day, maybe with two or three exceptions," Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, adding that Moscow would provide the U.S., Turkey and international bodies with a list of Kyiv's attacks during the past three weeks. His Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, fiercely contested that claim, saying Russia had launched "almost 70 missiles, over 2,200 (exploding) drones, and over 6,000 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, mostly at civilians," since agreeing to the limited pause on strikes. Russian forces hold the advantage in Ukraine, and Kyiv has warned Moscow is planning a fresh spring offensive to ramp up pressure on its foe and improve its negotiating position. European governments have accused Putin of dragging his feet. "Russia has to get moving" on the road to ending the war, U.S. President Donald Trump posted on social media Friday. He said the war is "terrible and senseless." Lavrov on Saturday reiterated that a prospective U.S.-backed agreement, also discussed in Saudi Arabia, to ensure safe navigation for commercial vessels in the Black Sea could not be implemented until restrictions are lifted on Russian access to shipping insurance, docking ports and international payment systems. Details of the prospective deal were not released, but it appeared to mark another attempt to ensure safe Black Sea shipping after a 2022 agreement that was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey but halted by Russia the following year. Ukraine's air force said a second F-16 fighter jet supplied by Western allies has been lost and its pilot, 26-year-old Pavlo Ivanov, killed. Ukraine's General Staff said the F-16 crashed while repelling a Russian missile strike. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday offered condolences to Ivanov's family, saying, "We are proud of our soldiers. We will give a strong and apt response." Ukraine said the first F-16 was shot down last August, after it intercepted three Russian missiles and a drone. Meanwhile, Russian drones killed at least two civilians in Ukraine's southern Kherson region on Saturday, according to local Gov.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lynn Benning, 67, said every financial downturn has hit her differently. During the stagflation of 1980, she was in her 20s, single, and stressed out about affording rent on an entry-level income. Amid the 2008 Great Recession, she was married and in her 40s. In today's uncertain economy, she's forgoing major purchases and focusing on building savings. Having cash on hand and avoiding credit card debt helped her reestablish financial stability in the past, she said. "Sometimes you're going to have bad luck," Benning said. "We just sucked it up and started over again." Billionaires, CEOs, and Wall Street have signaled they're bracing for an economic downturn. Recession jitters have Americans of all ages saying they're holding off on big purchases, delaying family and job plans, and feeling the emotional weight of economic uncertainty. With policy whiplash from the White House, BI spoke with three baby boomers about their experiences with past recessions, particularly the Great Recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis: how downturns shaped their finances, major life decisions, and how they approach setbacks. Now, the 72-year-old Connecticut resident's investments have weathered two major economic downturns, but she still managed to retire comfortably with a nest egg of over $1 million after a long career in academia and software engineering. She said she receives a few thousand dollars in monthly Social Security but doesn't have to rely on it to pay bills. "I put money in a diversified mutual fund and ignored it. Some Americans told BI that they lost tens of thousands of dollars from their 401(k)s in recent months, and others said they are rethinking their plans to leave the workforce. Still, older Americans BI spoke with cautioned against making rash investment decisions. In the long run, it's best to leave investments as is and ride out any market volatility, they said. BI has heard this advice from financial advisors, too. Per IG Wealth Management, it took the S&P 500 about six years to fully rebound from the 2008 crash, but other downturns have been resolved quicker. "Have six months at least of savings so that if something happens, you're not cashing in your 401(k)," she said. It may be tough advice for people who feel like they're living paycheck to paycheck, but boomers said if there is ever a time in life to try to cut back and save, it's ahead of a possible recession. Gail Lisenbard, 65, is doing her best to build savings. She's a philosophy lecturer at the University of Colorado Boulder but teaches remotely from Naples, Florida. Lisenbard's mindful spending strategy began after she lost her job in the 2008 recession. Since then, she has struggled to find a job that offers a high 401(k) match and has learned how to save as much money as possible on her lecturer income. She said she paid off her car, which used to cost her $200 a month, and has saved an additional $300 by cutting back on dining out and entertainment. Some of the baby boomers BI spoke with expressed regrets about navigating past recessions. At the same time, all said their takeaways from past recessions taught them how to better navigate the stock market, savings, and major life decisions in periods of uncertainty. A couple of months ago, as federal policy was beginning to change under Trump, Neff said she added more money to her emergency fund so that she could ride out economic changes. She's done the same in other times of unpredictability, and she said getting a bank account with compound interest allows her to build up her savings quicker. When BI spoke with her this week, she was taking lace-making classes in Belgium. "Live well within your means when times are good so that when times are bad, you still have a cushion," she said. "And I have always had enough of a cushion."</p>

"As a U.S. ally, the government shouldn't think about intentionally using U.S. Treasury holdings," Onodera told a programme on public broadcaster NHK, rejecting an opposition lawmaker's suggestion that Tokyo use its huge holdings of U.S. government debt as a negotiating tool in bilateral trade talks. "The weak yen has been among factors pushing up prices," Onodera said. The bilateral trade negotiations this week will likely include the thorny topic of currency policy, with some officials privately bracing for Washington to call on Tokyo to prop up the yen. The slow pace at which the Bank of Japan is raising interest rates from ultra-low levels could also come under fire, sources have told Reuters. Tokyo's top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa, the minister for economic revitalisation, will meet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday, two people familiar with the negotiations told Reuters. Japan has historically sought to prevent its currency from rising too much, as a strong yen would hurt its export-reliant economy. Tokyo intervened to buy the yen in 2022 and again last year, when the dollar had risen to nearly 160 yen. The Japanese currency has recently rallied in a broad-based sell-off of the dollar, which fell on Friday as low as 142.895 yen, its lowest since September. A massive wave of selling that hit U.S. government debt in Asia on Wednesday stoked market speculation China was among those unloading its holdings. The Treasury sell-off was among the factors that led Trump to announce a 90-day pause on his "reciprocal" tariff plan, with Bessent likely playing a key role.
