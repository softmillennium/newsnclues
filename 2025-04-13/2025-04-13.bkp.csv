            Blue Origin is taking a star-studded crew of six female passengers to the edge of space on Monday in one of the most closely watched suborbital space tourism missions in years.
    


            The flight will last about 10 minutes — carrying the group more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) into the sky and offering a few minutes of weightlessness before they descend.
    


            But at what point during the flight will singer Katy Perry, journalist Gayle King and their fellow passengers reach “space”?
    


            Is it when they look outside their window and the blue glow of the sky fades to black? Is it when they reach an altitude at which satellites can orbit? Or is it when the atmosphere grows so thin that it no longer plays a defining role in the flight physics?
    


            In the spaceflight community, there is no hard-and-fast definition.
    


            Space can be defined in several ways, and the usefulness of the criteria for determining where it starts can depend on the scenario. That's why various organizations around the world use different altitudes to mark that invisible threshold for recordkeeping purposes.
    


            And for suborbital space tourism, quibbling over definitions can take on a life of its own.
    


            Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, for example, have been known to spar publicly over the matter — mostly because of one, specific means of defining space: the Kármán line.
    


            Perhaps the most well-known and controversial demarcation of space, the Kármán line lies at 100 kilometers (62 miles) above sea level.
    


            Blue Origin's suborbital New Shepard flights travel just past that altitude.
    


            But the company's chief competitor, Virgin Galactic, does not. Its flights so far have reached up to about 88.5 kilometers (55 miles), which is still beyond the 81-kilometer (50-mile) mark that the US government has long used to define space.
    


            Still, Blue Origin has pointed to the Kármán line to assert its rides as a more legitimate path to earning “astronaut” status, saying in one 2021 social media post that “none of our astronauts have an asterisk next to their name” — a subtle dig at Virgin Galactic.
    


            Defining an astronaut, however, is almost a different matter entirely. In the early days of spaceflight, the US government established the 81-kilometer (50-mile) definition as a basis for awarding astronaut badges to military and NASA pilots.
    


            The Federal Aviation Administration has also given out commercial astronaut wings to private-sector adventurers who reached higher than 81 kilometers (50 miles). But the agency mostly did away with that program in 2021, opting to list participants on its website rather than award physical badges to private-sector fliers.
    


            SpaceX has also awarded its own set of silver wings to nongovernment passengers who fly on its orbital Crew Dragon capsule.
    


            So, in practice, deciding who is and isn't an astronaut is up to the recordkeeper.
    


            Former NASA astronaut Terry Virts told National Geographic in 2018 that he was not too concerned with gatekeeping the “astronaut” designation.
    


            “If you're strapping your butt to a rocket, I think that's worth something,” Virts told National Geographic in 2018 when asked about the issue. “When I was an F-16 pilot, I didn't feel jealous about Cessna pilots being called pilots. I think everybody's going to know if you paid to be a passenger on a five-minute suborbital flight or if you're the commander of an interplanetary space vehicle. Those are two different things.”
    


            In the public imagination, however, the idea of an astronaut often conjures images of a person floating in weightlessness, surrounded by the black cosmic expanse.
    


            But experiencing weightlessness has little to do with altitude — at least, not at the relatively low ones that Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic fly.
    


            Earth's gravitational pull will still be tugging on the Blue Origin capsule when it reaches weightlessness at apogee, the term in spaceflight for very top of a flight path.
    


            But the astronauts will be weightless because the energy the rocket and capsule drummed up after liftoff will be canceled out by Earth's gravity, giving them a minutes-long version of the sensation people experience when they reach the peak of a big roller-coaster hill.
    


            In contrast, astronauts on the International Space Station remain weightless for months at a time because they are in orbit around Earth — which requires far faster speeds than New Shepard's suborbital flights travel.
    


            Recordkeepers, however, have not stipulated that a person must travel to orbit to be deemed an astronaut.
    


            Civil and military pilots who commanded X-15 aircraft to altitudes above 81 kilometers (50 miles) during a test campaign in the 1960s, for example, were given astronaut wings.
    


            The US government uses the 81-kilometer (50-mile) mark to define space for many of the same reasons that other organizations use the Kármán line. The latter may just calculate the phenomenon differently.
    


            Theodore von Kármán, a Hungarian American engineer and physicist and cofounder of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was among the first to attempt to describe the altitude at which aeronautics becomes astronautics.
    


            But even Kármán's initial attempts in the 1950s were inexact.
    


            “The atmosphere is indeed dynamic and fluctuates in density which makes any delimitation imprecise,” according to one 2014 study on the definition of space. So, “the Kármán line fluctuates between” 84 kilometers (52 miles) and 100 kilometers (62 miles).
    


            Notably, 100 kilometers is how the Swiss-based Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, or the World Air Sports Federation, defines the Kármán line.
    


            “It's been that way since the ‘60s,” Scott Neumann, president of the federation's Astronautic Records Commission, ICARE, told CNN.
    


            The federation suggested in 2018 that it might lower its definitional altitude in response to new research about the Kármán line — but the organization ultimately didn't take such a step after crunching the numbers.
    


            “You have this nice maximum point, which we call the ‘maximum equilibrium velocity altitude,' and you can point to that on a graph and say, ‘This is where you're starting to become more like a spacecraft and less like an aircraft,'” Neumann said.
    


            The “maximum equilibrium velocity altitude” refers to the altitude at which the atmosphere becomes so thin that a vessel can no longer rely on the flight dynamics of airplanes.
    


            Instead, the vehicle will need the type of speed that rocket engines provide.
    


            While the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale decided to stick with its 100-kilometer definition, other researchers and institutions in the space industry don't share the same view.
    


            Spence Wise, senior vice president of space missions at aerospace manufacturing company Redwire Space, told CNN that he believes a more accurate altitude is closer to 88 kilometers (55 miles).
    


            Wise said that definition derives from the behavior of vehicles — mostly discarded rocket boosters — that have returned from space after being dragged out of orbit by atmospheric friction. For context, the “vacuum” of space isn't always a vacuum. Earth's atmosphere actually thins out over thousands of miles.
    


            “But what you can consistently see is that somewhere between 90 kilometers and 88 kilometers, these rocket bodies, as they're reentering (the atmosphere), stop acting like they're mostly drifting in space — being driven by Keplerian orbit kind of behavior,” Wise said, referring to the principles of planetary motion described by Johannes Kepler in the 17th century. “And they start just falling out of the sky.”
    


            Satellites and spacecraft can also briefly travel even closer to Earth during their orbits — as near as 80 to 90 kilometers high (50 to 56 miles) — without being immediately dragged down. In aerospace parlance, such low-flying spacecraft are referred to as Very-low Earth Orbit, or VLEO, satellites.
    


            Atmospheric drag grows more prominent at lower orbital altitudes, and that's a key consideration when designing a vehicle.
    


            “You can really drive orbits down, maybe down as far as 150 kilometers (93 miles) — but there's a cost you pay for that. … You're probably designing something that spends all of its time trying to stay in orbit,” Wise said.
    


            Put simply: When it comes to defining space, calculations and considerations change depending on the spaceborne object in question.
    


            “Some experts have noted that function and purpose might lead to more appropriate distinctions between aircraft and spacecraft than altitude,” the 2014 paper reads.
    


            And the distinctions can grow ever blurrier as technology evolves and new types of vehicles can achieve different types of flight.
    


            So, do these definitions really matter at all?
    


            “It's funny to think of it,” Wise said. “Is it still worthwhile to climb Everest? We need these agreed-to norms or definitions of this hard and epic thing to do. So particularly in the context of commercial travel to space, I think the Kármán line is a totally fine thing.”

Live Updates


            • Trade war: An exemption on tariffs for electronics has spurred optimism for US tech companies, but President Donald Trump's commerce secretary says the carve-out is not permanent, and a trade war with China is still brewing. Trump's whiplash trade policy has led to a dip in his economic approval ratings, according to a new CBS News poll.
    


            • Immigration crackdown: Legal battles continue surrounding the case of a mistakenly deported Maryland man, revoked visas for international students, and others swept up in the Trump administration's widespread immigration crackdown.
    


            • The week ahead: US and Iranian officials plan to meet again Saturday after a “constructive” first round of high-stakes nuclear talks yesterday. Elsewhere, GOP leaders will try to hold together divided members on the path toward funding Trump's agenda in Congress.
    


            Democrats ramped up their calls today for an investigation into whether President Donald Trump intentionally manipulated the market when he told Americans to invest right before announcing a 90-day pause on tariffs.
    


            “There's enough smoke here that should demand congressional hearings,” New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said on NBC's “Meet the Press” today.
    


                    “These are real, legitimate, justifiable questions, and not to have hearings, not to do any kind of oversight undermines the faith we have in our government.”
                





            Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, pressed by CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on whether she's seen evidence of insider trading after she called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the issue, said “that's what investigations are for.”
    


            “It's entirely appropriate to have an investigation to make sure that Donald Trump, Donald Trump's family, Donald Trump's inner circle, didn't get advanced information and trade on that information,” she said, pointing to her own bill banning trade on individual stocks for members of Congress, which she said has bipartisan support.
    


            National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett earlier this week pushed back against suggestions that Trump engaged in market manipulation, telling reporters at the White House Thursday, “I don't think that he ever had any other intent other than to get people to the table with serious policies.”
    


            That same day, Democratic Sens. Adam Schiff and Ruben Gallego sent a letter to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and US Office of Government Ethics Acting Director Jamieson Greer requesting “an urgent inquiry into whether President Trump, his family, or other members of the administration” engaged in any illegal transactions “informed by advanced knowledge of non-public information regarding his changes to tariff policy.”
    


            President Donald Trump brushed off concerns today about human rights abuses in the infamous prison where a mistakenly deported Maryland man is being held in El Salvador.
    


            Trump told reporters on Air Force One overnight that the prison holds “some of the worst people on earth.”
    


            Asked about his message for the Central American country's strongman President Nayib Bukele and if he's concerned about abuses in the prison, Trump said, “No, I think he's doing a fantastic job.” Trump is set to meet with Bukele on Monday at the White House.
    


            “He's taking care of a lot of problems that we have that we really wouldn't be able to take care of, from a cost standpoint,” Trump said of the Salvadoran leader.
    


             Pressed again on claims of human rights abuses, he responded, “I don't see it.”
    


Maryland man remains imprisoned there: Trump's comments come as outcry grows over the continued imprisonment of Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador's massive CECOT facility.
    


            Abrego Garcia was granted protected status by an immigration judge in 2019 that prohibited the federal government from sending him to El Salvador, which his attorneys say he fled due to gang violence more than a decade ago.
    


            The Trump administration said in a filing yesterday that Abrego Garcia is “alive and secure” at CECOT, but did not include an update on the administration's efforts to bring the man back to the US, as it has been ordered to do by a judge.
    


            Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois told “Fox News Sunday” farmers in his state will feel the effects of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs if other nations retaliate with their own levies on US exports.
    


            “We're the number one grower of soybeans. We sell about 60% of our soybeans to foreign buyers, but their response to those tariffs is going to hinder those sales,” Pritzker said.
    


            The governor said targeted tariffs can be “good trade policy” but that Trump's sweeping tariffs create “uncertainty that is causing, frankly, businesses across the board and especially farmers a lot of heartache.”
    


            “He's put massive tariffs across the board,” Pritzker said. “That's going to affect not only the cost for average working families going to the grocery store, but it's also going to affect the sales of crops that we grow in the state of Illinois and across the United States.”
    


            Pritzker recently visited farms in his state as part of his Standing Up for Illinois Tour, a tour that focuses on the “Trump Administration's extreme agenda” according to a news release.
    


Go deeper: Farmers are still struggling with the fallout from a trade war during Trump's first term. Now they're staring down another escalating economic feud with Beijing, which could once again turn away from the US as a key source of its agricultural imports.
    


            President Donald Trump's approval ratings for handling the economy and inflation have dropped, according to a new poll from CBS News, as a broad majority expects at least short-term price increases and economic harm from his tariff policies.
    


Here are a few key takeaways:



            • The economy and inflation: All told, 44% approve and 56% disapprove of Trump's handling of the economy, while only 40% approve and 60% disapprove on his handling of inflation. His approval numbers for both measures are down four points since late March.
    


            • Overall approval rating: This metric now stands at 47% in the CBS poll, down from 50% in March.
    


            • Who's responsible? A majority, 54% see Trump's policies as more responsible for the state of the economy than former President Joe Biden's policies, with 21% saying Biden is more responsible and 20% that both bear equal responsibility.
    


            • State of the economy: A little over half (53%) say the economy is currently getting worse, and most see its current state as poor (59%).
    


            • Impact on Americans: About half of respondents, 49%, said Trump's policies are making them financially worse off, more than double the 21% who say their finances are benefitting from his policies. The rest, 30%, say his policies are not impacting them financially.
    


            The CBS News poll was conducted online among 2,410 adults nationwide and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.
    


            Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says the tariff exemption on a wide range of electronics, including semiconductors and smartphones, will be temporary.
    


            Tariffs targeting specific business sectors will be imposed in the next couple months on certain products key to national security, which will be “not available for negotiation,” Lutnick said today on “ABC This Week.”
    


            “Those products are going to be part of the semiconductor sectoral tariffs, which are coming,” the commerce secretary said, referring to the electronics covered by the exemption.
    


                    “Semiconductors and pharmaceuticals will have a tariff model in order to encourage them to reshore,” he said. “We need our medicines, and we need semiconductors and our electronics to be built in America. We can't be beholden and rely upon foreign countries for fundamental things that we need.”
                





            Pressed why the administration made the move to exempt certain electronics from the reciprocal tariffs, Lutnick said the exemption will be temporary.
    


                    “These are included in the semiconductor tariffs that are coming, and the pharmaceuticals are coming. Those two areas are coming in the next month or two. So, this is not like a permanent sort of exemption,” Lutnick added. 
                





            Lutnick, who earlier this week said he had not been engaging with Chinese officials directly, said he believes Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping “will work this out” and Trump will secure a good result for the US.
    


            Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren says President Donald Trump's tariff strategy could have lasting and devastating impacts on Americans and urged her party to “tell the truth” about the economic pain inflicted by the president's policies.
    


            Though Warren called targeted tariffs an “important tool in the toolbox,” she told CNN's Jake Tapper that Trump's implementation of the policies has caused too much turmoil.
    


                    “You can't get an economy strong and moving forward when it's loaded with chaos and corruption. Investors will not invest in the United States when Donald Trump is playing red light-green light with tariffs,” she said on “State of the Union.”
                





            “Nobody can figure out what the rules will be five days from now, much less five years from now,” Warren said.
    


            The Massachusetts senator also characterized an exemption for electronics imported to the US as a “special deal” for Trump's tech CEO political donors.
    


Insider trading probe: Warren has called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether Trump intentionally manipulated the market in favor of his allies when he told Americans to invest right before announcing a 90-day pause on tariffs.
    


            Pressed on if she's seen any evidence of insider trading, Warren said people are looking into the stock purchases at that time and “that's what investigations are for.”
    


            National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has pushed back against suggestions that Trump engaged in market manipulation.
    


            President Donald Trump is “fully fit” to perform the duties of the presidency, the White House physician said in a memo released this morning following Trump's yearly physical.
    


            The note from Dr. Sean Barbabella, which included details of laboratory work, physical examinations and a cognitive test, concluded that Trump remains in “excellent health.”
    


            Trump weighs 224 pounds and is 75 inches tall, the note reports. His resting heart rate is 62 beats per minute, and his blood pressure is 128/74 mmHg.
    


            Trump scored 30 out of 30 on a Montreal Cognitive Assessment exam, the note said.
    


            Exams of Trump's various bodily systems came back normal, including of his eyes, head, ears, nose and throat. The physician noted scarring on Trump's right ear derived from the attempt on his life in Pennsylvania last year.
    


            Barbabella said a colonoscopy last summer revealed the president had diverticulitis, an inflammation caused when people develop small sacs in the walls of the colon. The sacs or pouches are called diverticuli. It's usually symptomless, but can cause discomfort and, sometimes, bleeding.
    


            “President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Health of State,” the memo concludes.
    


            The US special presidential envoy for Ukraine said Russia's deadliest attack on the country this year highlights “why President Trump is working hard to end this war.”
    


            Russian strikes hit the city of Sumy, in Ukraine's northeast, today as residents observed Palm Sunday. The attacks killed at least 32 people — including two children — and injured nearly 100, according to Ukraine's interior ministry.
    


                    “Today's Palm Sunday attack by Russian forces on civilian targets in Sumy crosses any line of decency,” Keith Kellogg wrote on X. “As a former military leader, I understand targeting and this is wrong. It is why President Trump is working hard to end this war,” he added.
                





Some background: In recent months, the relationship between the US and Ukraine has stood on wobbly footing as President Donald Trump has tried to broker a minerals deal and ceasefire agreement in the region.
    


            Trump temporarily withheld military aid and paused intelligence sharing after a spat with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in February over the minerals deal. But both were reinstated shortly after Ukraine agreed in principle to a US ceasefire proposal.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin did not accept that US-proposed ceasefire deal, however, and Trump on Friday urged Moscow to “get moving” on ending the war.
    


            “Too many people are DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war - A war that should have never happened, and wouldn't have happened, if I were President!!!” Trump wrote.
    


            China says the United States' decision to exempt smartphones and other electronic goods from President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs is a “small step” in correcting a misguided policy.
    


            A spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce told reporters in Beijing today that the exemption represents a “small step (by) the US to correct its unilateral ‘reciprocal tariff' erroneous practice.”
    


                    Since Trump announced his round of reciprocal tariffs on the US' trading partners on April 2, the spokesperson said, the policy “has not only failed to solve any problems of the US itself, but has seriously undermined the international economic and trade order,” going on to call for the US to ‘“completely cancel” the tariffs.
                





How we got here: On Wednesday, Trump announced he would pause the introduction of his reciprocal tariffs on all trading partners except China, which now has a 145% levy slapped on its goods. Beijing has retaliated by putting a 125% tariff on American imports into its market.
    


            But the Trump administration announced late Friday that some electronic goods imported into the country will be exempt from reciprocal tariffs, including from China. That would provide a huge relief to US tech giants like Apple.
    


            Smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts are among the exempted products.
    


If you missed news of the exemption yesterday, here's what to know.
    


            Coachella festivalgoers were in for a surprise act yesterday evening: Sen. Bernie Sanders.
    


            Rep. Maxwell Frost, the youngest member of Congress, introduced Sanders as the “opener” for musical artist Clairo.
    


            Sanders laid out the stakes of the political moment, telling the young crowd, “This country faces some very difficult challenges, and the future of what happens to America is dependent upon your generation.”
    


                    “Now you can turn away and you can ignore what goes on, but if you do that, you do it at your own peril. We need you to stand up to fight for justice,” he continued.
                





            The independent senator, who caucuses with Democrats and ran in the Democratic presidential primaries in 2016 and 2020, stuck to many common themes of his political speeches, including health care and climate change, calling President Donald Trump “dangerously wrong” on environmental issues.
    


            Sanders praised singer-songwriter Clairo not just for her music career, but for using her platform to stand up for women's reproductive rights and speak out against the war in Gaza.
    


            This comes as Sanders continues his nationwide “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The pair held a rally in Los Angeles featuring performances by Neil Young, Joan Baez and Maggie Rogers yesterday before Sanders' surprise trip to the desert.
    


            President Donald Trump took in multiple fights at UFC 314 in Miami last night, including a matchup between controversial athlete Bryce Mitchell and Jean Silva.
    


            In a long, rambling podcast in January, Mitchell — a 30-year-old UFC featherweight star —called Adolf Hitler a “good guy” and made a series of homophobic and antisemitic remarks explaining his beliefs that Hitler was actually fighting for Germany's people.
    


            UFC CEO Dana White, Mitchell's boss, unequivocally condemned his comments.
    


            “That's the problem with the internet and social media. You provide a platform for a lot of dumb and ignorant people,” White said at the time. “That's the beautiful thing about this business: For all of you that hate Bryce Mitchell, you get to see him hopefully get his a** whooped on global television.”
    


            That's what ultimately unfolded on Saturday. The president, seated ringside at The Octagon, congratulated Silva on his win.
    


More on Trump's trip: The president arrived to raucous applause from an expectedly friendly crowd at the Kaseya Center in Miami, participating in the “walkout” traditionally reserved for athletes as he became the first sitting president to attend a UFC event. He was joined by Elon Musk and top administration officials for the fights.
    


            Trump's attendance underscored the way his ties to combat sports and the surrounding “manosphere” helped him appeal to young men in the 2024 election.
    


            Welcome to today's live coverage of President Donald Trump's presidency.
    


            Trump's trade war is top of mind for US investors and consumers as we enter a new week, while we've also seen notable developments in the president's immigration crackdown, talks with Iran and other top policy priorities.

            • Trump's trade war could hurt farmers who voted for him: Farmers, many of whom live in states that went for Trump in the 2024 election, are still struggling with the fallout from a trade war during his first term. Now they're staring down another escalating economic feud with Beijing.
    


            • High-profile immigration cases: A judge has ruled that Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident, can be deported. But the legal battle against his detention and deportation is far from over. Meanwhile, a Maryland father who the Trump administration mistakenly deported, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, remains in an El Salvador mega-prison.
    


            • Funding Trump's agenda: Republican leaders have their work cut out for them in keeping unruly members unified on the plan to fund Trump's legislative agenda in Congress. 



            • Entering the “manosphere”: CNN correspondent Donie O'Sullivan spent the last few months in the so-called manosphere, observing a male-dominated culture surrounding UFC fights and podcast bros, to better understand a phenomenon that helped propel Trump into office. Subscribers can read the essay at the link above. Watch a portion of O'Sullivan's report here.



            • DOGE gets more Treasury access: A judge has relaxed the ban on Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency preventing it from accessing sensitive Treasury Department information related to millions of Americans.
    


            Delegations from Iran and the United States will meet again this week after wrapping up “constructive” nuclear talks yesterday that included the first direct contact between a Trump administration and Iranian official.
    


            The talks, held in the Gulf Arab nation of Oman, came with the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's fiery rhetoric toward Tehran and heightened fears that conflicts could deepen in the Middle East.
    


            Trump has threatened Iran with bombing if it does not agree to a new nuclear pact and has given Tehran a two-month deadline to accept a deal that would lead to it shrinking its nuclear footprint or eliminating its program altogether.
    


            So far, each side is publicly projecting optimism.
    


Here's where things stand after yesterday's talks: 



What the US said: The White House cast the talks as a step in the right direction, saying “direct communication” between Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who spoke primarily through Omani mediators, was “very positive and constructive.”
    


What Iran said: Araghchi similarly described the talks as “constructive,” telling state media, the first round of talks “got very close” to reaching a framework for negotiations.
    


            “The atmosphere in today's meeting was such that it ensured continuity and progress,” Araghchi told state broadcaster IRIB. He described a brief, parting interaction with Witkoff where the two spoke directly as a pleasant formality.
    


The two sides will meet again: Iranian and US officials said they plan to meet again Saturday to resume discussions. That meeting is likely to take place in Europe, a source familiar with the plans told CNN.
    


A bit of insight on the timeline: A source familiar with the meeting told CNN there is a belief the Trump administration wants to move fast, and Witkoff wants to make a political decision to green-light a deal without diving into highly technical details that could slow things down.

    Programming Note: Watch Donie O'Sullivan's reporting on “MisinfoNation: Extreme America” on The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper, tonight at 8 p.m. ET on CNN.



            How often do you think about the Roman Empire?
    


            Remember? The viral TikTok trend in 2023 where women asked the men in their lives how often they think about Ancient Rome, and it turned out they think about it a lot.
    


            That's been on my mind these last few months I've spent living in and reporting about the so-called “manosphere.”
    


            But first, we should clear up a few things about the manosphere.
    


            It was traditionally associated with the alt-right, with hate, and populated by overtly misogynist podcasters and influencers like Andrew Tate. Basically: the most toxic manifestations of masculinity.
    


            But the term became more prominent last year after Donald Trump was said to have successfully leveraged the male-oriented podcast space to help him win the election. “Manosphere” started to be used broadly to encapsulate more mainstream male-oriented podcasters like Joe Rogan.
    


            And lest we think all “bro” podcasters are the same, Joe Rogan (for all his flaws) is certainly not Andrew Tate. Indeed, painting them with the same broad brush only highlights part of the reason they are so popular in the first place.
    


            Many young men, rightly or wrongly, feel like they too are being painted with a broad brush. They feel that in the wider cultural zeitgeist any form of masculinity is inherently “toxic,” and that “all men are the same.”
    


            All men are not the same.
    


            But much of the appeal of male-oriented podcasters, whether they be meek or macho, is the same. They talk about physical fitness, they promote traditional (but not necessarily toxic) traits of masculinity and they often share a deep appreciation for mixed-martial arts (MMA), specifically the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC).
    


            And that can lead to the concern of many parents wondering how their Rogan-loving son might become a Tate-worshipping misogynist.
    


            Nowhere, other than perhaps Washington, DC, does the mainstream and the extreme coexist more prominently than at the UFC.
    


            The UFC is a useful parable in trying to understand the manosphere and wider male-oriented podcast space.
    


            Millions of American men love the UFC for all the traditional masculine reasons you'd expect: strength, brutality, heroism. It may not be for everyone, but it is a legitimate sport that people enjoy without embracing any undercurrents of hate.
    


            But the undercurrent is there — and just like how more mainstream male podcasters can be a gateway to toxic parts of the manosphere, the UFC doesn't disavow the toxicity as forcefully as it could.
    


            Take Bryce Mitchell, for instance,  a 30-year-old UFC featherweight star from Arkansas.
    


            Perhaps inspired by the success of other MMA world podcasters — in addition to his podcast, Joe Rogan is an MMA commentator — Mitchell started one of his own in January, naming it “ArkanSanity.”
    


            On its debut episode, Mitchell said Hitler was a “good guy.”
    


            “I really do think before Hitler got on meth, he was a guy I'd go fishing with,” Mitchell said.
    


            Now, there's no evidence Hitler took meth. And it's very possible that many of the sports stars we have idolized throughout history, not least the ones who get hit in the head for a living, also had very, very dumb takes like Mitchell's. They just didn't have podcasts.
    


            “That's the problem with the internet and social media. You provide a platform for a lot of dumb and ignorant people,” Mitchell's boss and UFC founder Dana White said in his unequivocal condemnation of the fighter's ignorant comments.
    


            Condemnation but not cancellation.
    


            “That's the beautiful thing about this business, for all of you that hate Bryce Mitchell, you get to see him hopefully get his ass whooped on global television,” White said.
    


            White invoked “free speech” in his decision to not punish Mitchell for his hate speech.
    


            Similarly, fighting against the perceived excesses of cancel culture and censorship is a huge part of the popularity of manosphere figures like Tate and more mainstream podcasters like Rogan.
    


            The sentiment that cancel culture and social media censorship went too far is something that is felt far beyond the manosphere. A belief exacerbated for some when they felt constrained by pandemic-era vaccine mandates, lockdowns, school closures and other restrictions.
    


            “I feel like we have to fight back with what we're told we're allowed to do,” Jake Shields, a former UFC star who also has a podcast, told me. “I just don't like to be told you're not allowed to talk to this person. Like, why can't I talk to them? I'm not saying I agree with (their) ideology,”
    


            Shields named his podcast “Fightback” — and while Rogan has welcomed “canceled” guests like Alex Jones, Shields has swallowed the forbidden fruit entirely.
    


            In the last few months, he's hosted David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, who Shields described as a “nice old man,” and Thomas Rousseau, the founder of Patriot Front, one of the most active white supremacist groups in the country.
    


            Shields isn't as extreme as some of his guests, but he still regularly traffics in antisemitism and homophobia.
    


            But what I found most interesting from listening to Shields' conversation with Rousseau was that a lot of it was relatable.
    


            They spoke about the need for men to have support systems for one another.
    


            “I think we need a community,” Shields said, “I was lucky, I was troubled when I was young. But then I found fighting and that gave me a community, a purpose, a brotherhood, something to come in(to). And men need this. We need this brotherhood.”
    


            Americans — men and women — are struggling. We are spending more and more time on our own. Things are so bad the previous surgeon general said loneliness had reached “epidemic” levels in the United States.
    


            Rousseau offers a chance at community — however, it's a fraternity based on white supremacy and hate.
    


            How misguided some men's searching for community became evident to Vera Papisova, a journalist who spent a year dating far-right men for a story for Cosmopolitan magazine, when one man brought her to what was ostensibly a gathering of neo-Nazis on a second date.
    


            “This was supposed to be a political group,” Papisova recalled, “but they were talking about relationship problems.”
    


            Some men who feel like they are falling behind are insecure and searching for answers and are finding them in the radical corners of the manosphere, Papisova says.
    


            And that's where we come back to the Roman Empire.
    


            Once again — just like the UFC — it's important to point out that a lot of guys like guy stuff. Ancient Rome is cool because of gladiators, Julius Caesar — and yes, the underlying lore of strength, bravery and epic feats of masculinity.
    


            If your son, brother or husband is into this stuff it is most likely he's just into it because he's into guy stuff.
    


            But it can get twisted.
    


            I was surprised during my time in the manosphere just how much they talk about history, religion and philosophy.
    


            But it makes sense.
    


            Men are turning to these podcasts for lots of different reasons. But some are coming because they are lonely and lacking purpose. They are seeking answers to really big questions — like why isn't their life working out the way they wanted it to? Why does it feel like they are falling behind?
    


            They are not finding sufficiently satisfactory answers to these questions in the present. Indeed, some of them are looking for someone to blame. They don't want to accept personal responsibility or engage with the inevitably complex socio-economic factors that have contributed to their station in life.
    


            And on some podcasts, they get the comforting answer of “it's not you, it's them.” They're being told to think “bigger picture” — it's not their fault their lives are terrible, it's “the Jews,” or “the gays” or “the immigrants” that are to blame. They're being told that Hitler wasn't a bad guy, and that Ancient Rome wasn't just great because of the gladiators — it was great because men were in charge. And whether they were looking or not, they've found the far right.
    


            For those men, Papisova says, “people need to be more open if you have the capacity.”
    


            “Because that one nice conversation you might have might change someone's day enough to not have to seek out help in an online support group, which is actually a bunch of white supremacists using political beliefs as an excuse for how they feel,” she explains.
    


            Her response to some of these men: “You don't need to be a neo-Nazi: you need therapy.”

            US President Donald Trump has imposed an additional 145% tariffs on all Chinese imports despite pausing his “reciprocal” levies on all other countries in a stunning reversal last week.
    


            But China is not backing down, saying it will “fight to the end” if Trump continues to escalate what is already becoming a full-blown trade war. On Friday, China also significantly ramped up its own duties on US imports into the country.
    


            To analyze which nation might blink first, CNN examined China's largest imports from the United States — soybeans — to see if and how that demand could be met elsewhere, what US farmers stand to lose and more.
    


            Both countries are deeply intertwined with each other on trade, though China sells about three times more to the US than it buys. The result is a significant trade deficit amounting to almost $300 billion in China's favor, a gap that Trump wants to close with tariffs.
    


            China buys mainly agricultural products from the US, including soybeans, oilseeds and grains. Soybean imports, mostly used for animal feed, already took a hit during Trump's first term when the two countries sparred in an earlier trade war.



            At the time, China sought to diversify the source of its imports and looked to other countries for agricultural products. It's set to do that again after imposing 125% tariff on all US imports – a move analysts expect could send China's imports of American agricultural commodities like soybeans close to zero.
    


            US soybean exports to China are now subject to a total tariff of 135%, resulting from 10% tariff imposed on certain agricultural products in March plus the 125% levy announced on Friday.
    


            During the first US-China trade war, Brazil — the world's leading soybean exporter — emerged as a winner, with China's imports of the legume surging over the years. Brazilian soybean exports to China have grown by more than 280% since 2010 while US exports have remained flat.
    


            Last November, Xi went on a state visit to Brazil, which was meant to strengthen ties between the two countries. In 2024, China was the main destination for Brazilian soybeans, accounting for more than 73% of the country's total soybean exports.
    


            With production expected to rise — the Brazilian soybean crop is projected to reach record levels this year — China could increase its imports from Brazil and other South American countries like Argentina, which is currently the world's third-largest soybean producer after Brazil and the US.
    


            The US agricultural sector lost around $27 billion during the 2018 trade war, with 71% of the losses being soybean-related, according to the American Soybean Association.
    


            And farmers, many of whom live in states that went for Trump in the 2024 election, are still struggling with the fallout. Only Illinois, the top soybean producer, and Minnesota, the third-largest soybean producing state, went for former Vice President Kamala Harris last November.
    


            China is looking for more allies beyond Brazil to counter US tariffs and expand trade cooperation. On Thursday, China announced that it was willing to work with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries to strengthen communication and coordination. Earlier this week China's Commerce Minister discussed with EU officials restarting talks on trade relief and negotiations on electric vehicles.

Follow:


            President Donald Trump traded the Oval Office for The Octagon on Saturday night.
    


            The president arrived to raucous applause at the Kaseya Center in Miami, participating in the “walkout” traditionally reserved for athletes as he became the first sitting president to attend a UFC event.
    


            Trump, who walked out ahead of the featherweight title bout between Australian Alexander Volkanovski and Diego Lopes of Brazil, was joined by close ally Elon Musk, along with top administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and FBI Director Kash Patel. Trump was spotted embracing UFC CEO Dana White, as well as podcast host Joe Rogan and basketball legend Shaquille O'Neal, on the arena floor.
    


            His attendance at the late-night fight underscores his reemergence in the American pop cultural mainstream as he deploys the trappings of office to attend some of the nation's premier sporting events. It also highlights his long and loyal ties to the UFC organization and its CEO, Dana White, and the alignment between the mixed martial arts brand and the young men who propelled Trump back to the White House.
    


            With the exception of nearly weekly trips to his Mar-a-Lago property in South Florida, the president's domestic travel has been rare during his second term. But since taking office, he has flown aboard Air Force One to attend the Super Bowl in New Orleans, the Daytona 500 in Daytona Beach, and the NCAA men's wrestling championships in Philadelphia.

            His warm reception at those events has emphasized his transformation from a pariah and punchline of American popular culture back to the status he enjoyed during his “Apprentice” days.
    


            “President Trump and the UFC are cultural icons. He is a fan of the sport and the elite competitive spirit of all the athletes who step into the Octagon,” White House communications director Steven Cheung told CNN.
    


            Cheung added, “He'll be sitting cage side, like he always does, and the crowd will erupt in applause as he makes his signature walkout.”
    


            Trump, who has long styled himself a “fighter,” successfully tapped into the male-oriented podcast sphere during his 2024 campaign, boosting his turnout among low-propensity voters as he and top surrogates leaned into interviews with Rogan, Barstool Sports' “Bussin' With The Boys,” and Andrew Schulz's “Flagrant,” among others – offering listeners long-form, unfiltered and un-fact-checked conversations.
    


            Many male-oriented podcasters discuss physical fitness, promote traditional traits of masculinity and often share a deep appreciation for mixed martial arts, specifically UFC.
    


            Founded in 1993, UFC has emerged as a mainstream, major sporting organization in recent years — in parallel, in some ways, to Trump's political ascendance. In 2019, the sport announced a deal with the Walt Disney Company to broadcast its “Fight Night” events on ESPN+, and UFC broadcasts now reach an estimated 975 million households across 170 countries, according to a recent press release.
    


            Trump has supported the brand for decades, most recently attending a UFC event shortly after his November election victory at New York City's Madison Square Garden, where he was cheered upon his arrival to a ringside seat, feted with a special video celebrating his win, and flanked by White, Kid Rock, House Speaker Mike Johnson, Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump Jr.
    


            Like with many of the president's closest allies, Trump's longtime friendship with the UFC CEO is one forged in loyalty.
    


            In White's early days with the organization, he was struggling to secure venues for his fights. Trump agreed to host the event at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City in 2001.
    


analysis
Trump's retribution sends a chilling message to dissenters



            “Nobody wanted to give him a ring because they said it's a rough sport, a little rough. And I helped him out a little bit and I went and they said, ‘This is the roughest sport I've ever seen.' But I began to like it and he loved it, and nobody's done a better job in sports,” Trump said during his 2024 victory speech in West Palm Beach as White joined the new president-elect's nearest and dearest onstage.
    


            White emerged as a key surrogate for Trump in 2024 as his campaign sought to bolster its appeal to young men. UFC has a plugged-in fan base on and offline — boasting tens of millions of followers on social media. One of its biggest stars, Conor McGregor, has 46.7 million Instagram followers.
    


            So when the time came for the then-former president to select someone to introduce him at the Republican National Convention in July 2024, Trump, who was introduced by daughter Ivanka in 2020 and wife Melania in 2016, went with White.
    


            “I'm in the tough guy business, and this man is the toughest, most resilient human being that I've ever met in my life,” White said in his remarks, calling Trump a “real American bada**.”

Follow:


            A sightseeing helicopter plunged into the Hudson River on Thursday, turning a family outing above Manhattan's misty skyline into a tragedy.
    


            The helicopter carried six people, including three children and their parents – who have both worked for Siemens, a German multinational technology conglomerate. It lifted off from a Manhattan heliport and followed a familiar route: circling the Statue of Liberty, gliding north along the Hudson toward the George Washington Bridge and then turning south. About 16 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft crashed into the water, according to analysis by CNN and FlightRadar24.
    


            Witnesses described the helicopter flipping and spiraling before crashing near the New Jersey shoreline upside down, scattering debris across the river.
    


            “The helicopter was a little bit like nose down, slightly, and I saw the propeller separating from the helicopter. It kept spinning in the air alone. Nothing was attached to it,” Sarah Jane Raymond Ryer, who saw the crash unfold, told CNN affiliate WCBS.
    


            A video obtained by CNN shows the rotor blades detached from the helicopter and flying through the air. “The videotape in this case is very dramatic and very important to the investigation,” former National Transportation Safety Board managing director Peter Goelz told CNN on Friday.
    


            Eyewitness Avi Rakesh told CNN's Jessica Dean that what was left of the helicopter appeared to be so out of control, he didn't feel safe in his own building.
    


            “Debris was flying everywhere. I was concerned that something might come and hit the window,” Rakesh said.
    


            The helicopter was not equipped with any flight data recorders, including video or camera recorders, and none of its avionics onboard recorded information that could be used for the investigation, the NTSB said Saturday. The helicopter's last major inspection was on March 1, and it had completed seven tour flights before the accident, according to the NTSB.
    


            Here's what we know about the crash that killed everyone on board:
    


            The victims include Agustín Escobar, 49, his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal, and their three children - two sons, ages 4 and 11, along with a daughter who was to turn 9 on Friday. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the family was visiting from Spain, and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said in a social media post that the family was in New York to celebrate Camprubí's 40th birthday.
    


            “I want to (say) that they left together,” Joan Camprubí, whose sister was killed in the crash, said at a news conference on Saturday. “They left without suffering, and they left with a smile on their faces. And that's important for us as a family. We want to remind and honor their happiness and their smiles forever.”
    


            “We want to move the bodies as soon as possible, home, back home … with all the family to rest in peace together in our place,” Camprubí added.
    


            Escobar served as CEO of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, the transportation solutions division of Siemens AG.
    


            “We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustin Escobar and his family lost their lives. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all their loved ones,” a Siemens Mobility spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, expressed his condolences, calling the incident “an unimaginable tragedy.”
    


            Mercè Camprubí Montal was the global commercialization manager for Siemens Energy, according to her LinkedIn page. Siemens Energy is an independent company that was spun off from Siemens AG in 2020.
    


            “We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of a colleague due to a tragic accident during vacation,” said a statement from Siemens Energy. “Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of the victims.”
    


            In addition to her international corporate career, Camprubí is known in Spain as a member of a prominent sports family. Camprubí's grandfather and great-grandfather both served as presidents of FC Barcelona, one of the most popular soccer clubs in the world.
    


            The pilot was identified as 36-year-old Seankese Johnson, according to city officials. He was certified to fly commercial helicopters since August 2023, according to FAA records, and the NTSB noted he had completed 788 hours in the air.
    


            A friend of Johnson, helicopter pilot Matt Klier, told CNN affiliate WABC he was “an amazing pilot.”
    


            “He was just a super good dude,” Klier said, holding back tears. “I'm a helicopter pilot, we started at the same time. The man was an amazing pilot.”
    


            Mayor Adams spoke about Johnson at the news conference on Saturday after dropping off flowers in the water in honor of those who were killed.
    


            “He was a Navy SEAL. He fought to defend this country,” Adams said, acknowledging Johnson's wife for her loss. “Our prayers are with all of the family members involved, and no words can fill the void, the loss,” he said.
    


            “Their sorrow is our sorrow,” Adams said. “New York City is a family, and we consider this (as) a loss of our family members with unexpected pain and suffering.”
    


            The cause of the crash remains unclear, but its sudden descent stunned witnesses as first responders raced to rescue the victims.
    


            The helicopter took off at 2:59 p.m. from Manhattan's downtown heliport following a popular sightseeing route, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. After circling the Statue of Liberty, it flew north along the Hudson River, reaching the George Washington Bridge by 3:08 p.m. It then turned south along the New Jersey shoreline, where it lost control shortly after, Tisch said.

            Visibility at the time was 10 miles, though the region was cloudy with winds of 10 to 15 mph and gusts up to 25 mph. A weather system was expected to bring light rain later in the afternoon.
    


            At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a crash near Pier A Park in Hoboken, New Jersey. Witnesses said the helicopter appeared to stop midair before pieces broke off, consistent with preliminary emergency reports, Tisch said.
    


            Ipsitaa Banigrhi, a Jersey City resident, said the crash sounded “like thunder,” she told WCBS.
    


            “Then I saw black particles flying. Again, I thought maybe it's just dust or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by. I think that's when it was like, ‘OK, what's happening,'” Banigrhi told WCBS.
    


            With the helicopter's catastrophic failure in midair, there was no way to guide the aircraft to safety, a former combat pilot told CNN's Kate Bolduan.
    


            “There's nothing that pilot could have done in that situation to recover the aircraft,” Brandt Anderson said.
    


            First responders from NYPD and New York City Fire Department teams pulled six people from the water. Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others succumbed to injuries shortly after, Tisch said. Two children were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where they were later pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X.
    


            The aircraft's main fuselage was retrieved from the river on Thursday evening, and dive operations continued Friday and Saturday, and will continue on Sunday, according to the NTSB. The recovered parts will be sent to NTSB labs in Washington D.C. for closer inspection, the agency said.
    


            The search continues for the main rotor, transmission, roof and tail of the aircraft, according to NTSB.
    


            The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities.
    


            In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there “may have been corrosion removed” from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter's component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be “considered unairworthy,” according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010.
    


            In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a “bang” that was followed by the “Engine Out warning horn.” The pilot inflated the helicopter's floats and got the passengers to safety on a boat.
    


            “The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,” Michael Roth, the CEO of the company operating the flight, told CNN of Thursday's crash. “I'm a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn't stopped crying since this afternoon.”
    


            When asked about the helicopter's maintenance, he said, “That's something my director of maintenance handles.” The director of maintenance declined to comment.
    


            Maintenance records are not publicly accessible, and the NTSB restricts what companies can disclose during an ongoing investigation.
    


            “(The pilot) called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn't arrive,” Roth told The Telegraph Thursday.
    


            Concern about the safety of low-altitude helicopter flights in the New York City area has a long history.
    


            “Helicopter operations in the Hudson River have been under criticism for many, many years,” former Department of Transportation inspector general Mary Schiavo told CNN.
    


            At least 32 people died in helicopter accidents in New York City from 1977 to 2019, according to the Associated Press. That included a 2018 crash that killed five passengers in a “doors-off” aerial tour, which subsequently became more tightly regulated by the FAA. The victims in that case drowned after being unable to free themselves from their safety harnesses after plunging into the water, an NTSB investigation found.
    


            “I am calling for a serious reevaluation of current policies and am urging the city to consider an immediate moratorium on non-essential helicopter flights from city-owned heliports while investigations are ongoing,” New York City Councilwoman Amanda Farías, chair of the council's Committee on Economic Development, said Friday.
    


            The Eastern Region Helicopter Council, a trade group that represents helicopter operators, says a ban would not be the right solution.
    


            “The helicopter community is in shock and mourning after the tragic and horrific events of yesterday,” chairman Jeff Smith said in a statement. “Unfortunately, some well-meaning but misguided leaders are using this tragedy to exploit and push their decades-old agenda to ban all helicopters. Before taking legislative action, we need to learn more from the investigation.”
    


            The helicopter, a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, was built in 2004 and held an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid through 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records.
    


            Maintenance records are not public, and during investigations, NTSB rules prohibit companies from releasing certain information relating to the accident.
    


            The investigation into the cause of the crash will pore over documentation on all the work that was done on the aircraft. That would include the company's compliance with two recent FAA-issued airworthiness directives.
    


            One directive from May 2023, required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure.
    


            The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters' main rotor blades because of “delamination.” That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail.
    


            It remains unclear whether any of these issues played a role in Thursday's crash.
    


            Both the FAA and the NTSB are investigating the crash. The NTSB has dispatched a “go-team” to the site to examine the wreckage and review maintenance records, it said on social media, and is asking the public to submit any additional video or photos they may have.
    


            The helicopter was flying within New York's Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where air traffic control support is limited, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a post on X. Duffy added that the helicopter had received air traffic assistance from LaGuardia Airport shortly before entering the uncontrolled zone.

Russian and Ukrainian representatives will hold direct talks in Ankara next week, CNN Turk has reported, citing sources in the Turkish Defense Ministry.

Delegations from the two countries will meet to discuss security in the Black Sea, the outlet said in an article on Sunday.

The meetings will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Turkish Naval Forces headquarters in Ankara, according to sources.

During talks between Russian and US experts in Riyadh in late March, it was agreed to move towards reviving the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which according to the Kremlin, should include the removal of Western restrictions against the Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial institutions involved in the international sale of food and fertilizers. A maritime ceasefire is seen by Moscow and Washington as a step towards the diplomatic settlement of the Ukraine conflict.

The Black Sea Grain Initiative, originally brokered in July 2022 by the UN and Türkiye, envisioned the safe passage of Ukrainian agricultural products in exchange for the US and EU lifting its restrictions on Russian grain and fertilizer exports. Moscow withdrew from the deal a year later, citing the West's failure to uphold its obligations.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky claimed earlier that Kiev rejected a maritime truce due to it representing “a weakening of positions and a weakening of sanctions” against Russia.

US President Donald Trump confirmed last month that his administration is considering lifting some curbs on Moscow in order to revive the Black Sea Grain Initiative, saying that “there are about five or six conditions. We are looking at all of them.”

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ruled out relaxing EU restrictions on Moscow, insisting they should “remain in effect until a just and lasting peace is established in Ukraine.”

According to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the maritime truce could take effect only when certain conditions set out by Russia are met. “Of course, this time justice must prevail, and we will continue our work with the Americans [on the Black Sea Initiative],” Peskov stressed.

Relief International medics among dead as paramilitaries step up violence against region's displaced people

Paramilitaries in Sudan have murdered more than 200 civilians in a wave of attacks in displacement camps and around the city of El Fasher, the last big city still in the hands of the Sudanese army in the Darfur region.

The deaths include at least 56 civilians killed by the Rapid Support Forces over two days of attacks in Um Kadadah, a town they seized on the road to El Fasher.

The violence is some of the worst in the Darfur region since the civil war between the army and the paramilitary forces began almost exactly two years ago.

The UN said killings were continuing at two large displacement camps, including of the entire medical staff of Relief International, which was operating the only remaining clinic inside Zamzam camp. RSF forces were said to be burning buildings throughout Zamzam on Sunday, claiming they were seeking Sudanese government fighters hiding in the camps.

The US has condemned both sides in the war, saying the RSF has committed genocide in Darfur and that the army has attacked civilians.

The conflict has essentially divided Sudan in two, with the army holding sway in the north and east while the RSF controls most of Darfur and parts of the south.

The war has killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million and created what the International Rescue Committee described as “the biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded”.

The deaths at the weekend put extra pressure on the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to deliver a decisive response on the issue of civilian protection when he convenes a ministerial conference on Sudan in London on Tuesday. The conference of 20 countries and organisations will inevitably shine a spotlight on the United Arab Emirates, past backers of the RSF, to issue an unambiguous statement of condemnation.

The attacks on Um Kadadah, about 180km (112 miles) east of El Fasher, came one day after RSF fighters said they had taken the town from army forces. The victims appeared to be targeted because of their ethnicity.

Lammy tweeted: “Shocking reports are emerging from El Fasher, Darfur, where indiscriminate RSF attacks have killed civilians, including aid workers. This gives added urgency to Tuesday's Sudan conference in London with international partners. All sides must commit to protection of civilians.”

The UN's resident and humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, said she was “appalled and gravely alarmed by reports emerging from Zamzam and Abu Shouk displacement camps as well as El Fasher town in North Darfur”. The two camps protect as many as 700,000 civilians displaced by previous violence and famine.

The Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab said it had observed that “arson attacks have burned multiple structures and significant areas of the Zamzam camp in the centre, south and south-east portions of the camp”.

The UN reported that the RSF had launched coordinated ground and air attacks on the camps and El Fasher from multiple directions on 11 April, triggering intense clashes and resulting in catastrophic consequences for civilians.

The UN said more than 100 people, including more than 20 children, were feared dead, including nine Relief International personnel. The Sudanese army said more than 70 people had been killed in El Fasher alone. The precise death toll was unverifiable due to deliberate internet shutdowns implemented by the RSF.

Last month the army recaptured the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, about 1,000km (600 miles) to the east.

Adam Regal, a spokesperson for the General Coordination for Refugees and Displaced in Darfur, said Zamzam and Abou Shouk remained under artillery shelling and an assault by RSF armed vehicles on Sunday.

Relief International said of the loss of its staff: “We understand this was a targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region to prevent access to healthcare for internally displaced people. We are horrified that one of our clinics was also part of this attack – along with other health facilities in El Fasher.”

Both the Biden and Trump administrations in the US have said the RSF has committed genocide in Darfur, and that the army has attacked civilians. The Sudanese government last week took the UAE to the international court of justice, the UN's top court, claiming the UAE was complicit in genocide.

Kate Ferguson, a co-director of Protection Approaches, said: “It appears that the RSF is attacking Zamzam, Abu Shouk and El Fasher simultaneously for the first time, including a ground assault on Zamzam. This is a significant escalation in violence against civilians in the North Darfur region and requires immediate diplomatic response.”

She said she feared such “a coordinated military effort by the RSF would represent the beginning of the assault we have all so long feared – including further acts of genocide and crimes against humanity – and should trigger all emergency diplomatic and other responses.”

She added: “In hosting the conference on Tuesday, Lammy holds the heavy responsibility of securing a collective response to the appalling atrocities committed yesterday and this weekend. It is a tough but rare opportunity to bring international commitment to protect civilians in Sudan from strong words to resolute action.

“This means sincerely confronting those backing and enabling atrocity crimes, and establishing a serious senior coalition willing to advance at pace the political and technical solutions necessary to halt genocide, crimes against humanity, war and famine.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Books detail president increasingly unfit to take on Trump, and party infighting that doomed Kamala Harris's chances

Joe Biden plans to write a book about his presidency which ended in his historic withdrawal from the 2024 election, pushed out by senior Democrats convinced he was too old and infirm and replaced by his vice-president, Kamala Harris.

Sources close to Biden told news outlets the book could be published next year, by which time Biden will be 83 and doubtless – like other US presidents' autobiographies – it will be a self-serving narrative lauding his time in office.

But readers have not needed to wait for an inside look at Biden's time in power, especially his final year, which ended in his withdrawal from his re-election bid. This month saw the publication of two books containing explosive reporting on Biden's downfall, and coming months will bring two more: so far the picture emerging is a damning one for Biden, his top aides and the Democratic party.

The books have detailed a president increasingly unfit for the task of taking on Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election and his top aides in denial about it, or actively seeking to cover it up, even as the administration warned about the existential threat Trump posed to American democracy.

Journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes were first out of the gate with Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House. Revelations included how Biden aides planned for his withdrawal in 2023, then when his disastrous June 2024 debate against Donald Trump supercharged calls for him to quit, “aggressively” argued that he should not, given Harris would be a “disaster”.

Then Chris Whipple, author of a book about Biden's 2020 win, released Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History. Whipple's book is slim, at just 204 double-spaced pages. But it hits hard. Ron Klain, a former White House chief of staff, describes debate preparations in which Biden seemed “out of it”, unable to “grasp … the back and forth”, and also says that after the debate disaster, Biden declined to do political work necessary to survive, preferring to enjoy the trappings of power.

Responding to Guardian reporting on Whipple's book, Klain said he “never doubted the president's mental acuity”, and had merely expressed concern that Biden made tactical errors, such as thinking “being a great foreign policy president was enough”.

In his interview with Whipple, Klain also describes his opposition to calls for Biden to drop out and anguish when he did so. Observers asked why Whipple did not challenge Klain on this, given his unsparing depiction of Biden's aged state.

Biden dropped out on 21 July. That gave Harris a near-impossible task, just 107 days to put together a campaign to beat Trump. Nonetheless, Allen, Parnes and Whipple report extensive shortcomings in the vice-president's own approach, including the flawed selection of the untested Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, as her running mate, as well as infighting between Harris staffers and Biden aides who maintained campaign control.

The result was a crushing defeat, and Trump's return to power.

Molly Jong-Fast, host of the Fast Politics podcast, said Parnes, Allen and Whipple had shown Biden's aides to be chiefly at fault: “Had Harris not had the Precision Strategies crew, think of what she could have done. I think that had she had a little more time and a little bit better advising, she could have won it.”

Reed Galen, a Republican strategist turned anti-Trump campaigner and host of The Home Front podcast, was more blunt: “Anyone who knew [about Biden's decline] and did nothing, or knew and went to work for Kamala Harris's campaign and didn't let her run her own race, should never be given a position of responsibility again.”

For Biden, worse could yet be to come. In May, Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios will release the starkly titled Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.

Announcing their book, the two reporters pointed to widespread reporting, including by Parnes, Allen and Whipple, that family members including Jill Biden and Hunter Biden, eventually pardoned by his father, persuaded Joe Biden to seek a second term.

“Biden, his family and his team let their self-interest and fear of another Trump term justify trying to put an at times addled old man in the Oval Office for four more years,” Tapper and Thompson said. “What was the extent of it? Was it a cover-up? Was it a conspiracy?”

According to Politico, Original Sin is the book “Biden allies fear most”, with aides “shocked to read the ‘cover-up' framing [which] wasn't used explicitly in some of the interviews facilitated by Biden handlers”.

A spokesperson said Tapper and Thompson “found people post-election much more willing to talk candidly” and “interviewed more than 200 people to figure out just what went behind the scenes of the Biden White House, conducting extensive reporting and factchecking, including with former president Biden's team”.

A fourth campaign book, 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, by Josh Dawsey (Wall Street Journal), Tyler Pager (New York Times) and Isaac Arnsdorf (Washington Post), was said to be the only one that “involved the Biden and Harris teams in a factchecking process”. It comes out in July.

If journalism is the first draft of history, books by journalists may just be the second. Nobody yet owns the narrative and debate will run on. Nonetheless, Jong-Fast said Allen, Parnes and Whipple had already shown Democrats were simply in “big denial” about Biden's decline until it was too late.

“I'm not convinced that it was a huge conspiracy,” Jong-Fast said. “What the right wants is a smoking gun, a moment where a cabal got together and was like, ‘Yes, we will do this [cover-up].' And from what I've read from all these books, there's not a smoking gun, it's just Biden got older and older, and people were in denial about it, which is a larger problem with the gerontocracy writ large.”

The former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, a key player in all accounts of Biden's downfall, sits in Congress at 85. Chuck Schumer, whose role in pushing Biden out is described in another recent book, Mad House by Annie Karni and Luke Broadwater of the Times, is 74 and shows no sign of quitting as Democratic leader in the Senate.

“This should be a call to action,” Jong-Fast said. “Democrats should read these books and go, ‘Oh my God, we need people to retire at normal ages and not stay on and on. You're not an airline pilot at 85. I don't have an 87-year-old doing eye surgery on me. That doesn't mean you're not worthy and wonderful and valuable. It just means that you probably shouldn't be serving.

“If Democrats are going to run on this idea that American democracy is in trouble under Trump, then they can't keep their friends in office for as long as they want. That's it. Period. Paragraph.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Former City minister accused of illegally receiving plot of land from her aunt, ousted PM Sheikh Hasina 

An arrest warrant for the former City minister Tulip Siddiq has been issued in Bangladesh with a new allegation accusing her of illegally receiving a plot of land from her aunt, the ousted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.

Bangladeshi media reported the warrant was issued by a judge for 53 people connected to Hasina, including Siddiq. There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Bangladesh.

Siddiq's representative said there was “no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means”.

The MP for Hampstead and Highgate has denied allegations of corruption linked to her aunt's collapsed regime and accused the Bangladeshi authorities of a “targeted and baseless” campaign against her.

Siddiq resigned in January as economic secretary to the Treasury, citing the risk of becoming a distraction and saying the government was being harmed by the furore over her use of properties given to herself and her family by allies of the regime of Hasina.

She was not deemed by Keir Starmer's ethics adviser to have broken any rules over her use of the homes and he found no evidence to suggest that any of Siddiq's assets were derived from anything other than legitimate means.

But Laurie Magnus did find a lack of records and said lapse of time meant he had “not been able to obtain comprehensive comfort in relation to all the UK property-related matters”.

A Conservative party spokesperson said: “If it is the case that Keir Starmer's choice for anti-corruption minister is the subject of an international arrest warrant for corruption, she should immediately stand down as Labour MP.

“It is shocking that Keir Starmer believes ‘the door remains open' for Ms Siddiq returning to a government position. Keir Starmer must put his close friendship and association with Ms Siddiq aside and take the action he should have months ago.”

Bangladesh's anti-corruption commission (ACC) has alleged that Siddiq, 42, received a 670 sq metre plot in the diplomatic zone of the capital, Dhaka, through ties to the former rulers, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

The allegation is that Siddiq persuaded her aunt to allocate three plots of land in the exclusive enclave for her family members, including her mother, Sheikh Rehana, her brother Radwan and her younger sister Azmina. The family are all based in Britain.

The ACC chair, Mohammad Abdul Momen, previously told the BBC the investigations in Bangladesh were “based on documentary evidence of corruption” and Siddiq should return to fight her case in Bangladesh.

In a statement made through her lawyers, Siddiq's representatives said: “The ACC has made various allegations against Ms Siddiq through the media in the last few months. The allegations are completely false and have been dealt with in writing by Ms Siddiq's lawyers.

“The ACC has not responded to Ms Siddiq or put any allegations to her directly or through her lawyers. Ms Siddiq knows nothing about a hearing in Dhaka relating to her and she has no knowledge of any arrest warrant that is said to have been issued.

“To be clear, there is no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means.

“She has never had a plot of land in Bangladesh and she has never influenced any allocation of plots of land to her family members or anyone else.

“No evidence has been provided by the ACC to support this or any other allegation made against Ms Siddiq and it is clear to us that the charges are politically motivated.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Since the first UK sighting in 2016 of Vespa velutina – the Asian or yellow-legged hornet – beekeepers and scientists have waged a vigorous campaign to minimise the damage this invasive species can do to Britain's biodiversity and bee colonies.

Last year, a wet spring and washout summer appeared to have hindered the insect's population growth as the number of nests spotted in the UK dropped from 72 in 2023 to 24 in 2024. But it was also the first year that the National Bee Unit received confirmation, via DNA, that the hornets had successfully bred and over-­wintered in the UK.

Now experts fear the dry, sunny start to spring this year and the rapid spread of the species in Europe will lead to a surge in this year's numbers.

“Unprecedented” early sightings of Asian hornets have been recorded in Jersey, leading experts to suspect that record numbers could try to establish nests in the UK this year.

“The first queens were more than two weeks early this year,” said John De Carteret, a founding member of the Jersey Asian Hornet Group, which has about 550 traps in place this year. “We're obviously concerned.”

There were 262 queen Asian hornets recorded on Jersey by 11 April, a year-on-year increase of 1,090%.

“When we reach 266 queens, we will equal the total from 2024 – and that figure wasn't reached until 25 June,” said De Carteret.

Ian Campbell, of the British Beekeepers Association, said: “There's a strong risk of this year's numbers being at least as high as in 2023 and the potential to be even higher. It would be a surprise if numbers were not above the 2024 level.”

The species is carnivorous, and a typical nest of between 2,000 and 3,000 Asian hornets can devour more than 11kg (about 24lb) of insects a season, according to Campbell – about the weight of 90,000 bees.

The public is being urged to “be vigilant everywhere” and learn how to identify and report Asian hornets, which have yellow legs and a distinctive orange band on the fourth segment of their abdomens – alongside entirely black velvety thoraxes, which distinguish them from the native European hornet.

Like bees, their stings can cause painful and potentially deadly allergic reactions. Any “sightings of concern” should be reported to the government's National Bee Unit via the Asian Hornet Watch app or online, using the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (UKCEH) reporting tool.

“Yellow-legged hornets cause significant damage to native pollinators, including our much-loved honeybees,” said Kate Wilson, head of the National Bee Unit. “Thanks to increasing reports to the app and online, it is not unexpected that sightings may occur earlier in the year. We encourage the public to remain vigilant and continue to report any potential sightings to us.”

Such sightings can help people working to combat the spread of Asian hornets to understand the national picture. “I collected one from a lady in her 80s after she captured it in a yogurt tub, while the youngest person who reported one was eight,” De Carteret said.

Ecology professor Helen Roy of UKCEH and Exeter University said the hornets pose “a major threat” to wildlife and biodiversity: “There isn't a natural enemy that we're aware of that could control the Asian hornet.”

It is thought that successive generations of the offspring of a single mated queen, which was accidentally introduced to France in a container of Chinese crockery in 2004, have now reached 15 European countries, including the UK. “In some countries like Spain and Belgium, we've seen numbers increase from a handful of nests to 10,000 nests in four years,” said Campbell.

France is believed to have more than a half a million nests, which researchers believe could be costing the French economy an estimated €30.8m a year in lost bee colonies and honey revenue, while the invaders have reduced honey production by 35% in Portugal and 50% in Liguria, Italy, in recent years.

In March, the first large-scale study of the Asian hornet's diet, run by researchers at Exeter University, found 1,400 different species in their guts. Of the top 50 invertebrate prey species identified, 43 were known to visit flowers. These included Europe's three main crop pollinators: the European honeybee, the buff-tailed bumblebee and the red-tailed bumblebee.

De Carteret, a retired police forensic officer, said hornets will typically “butcher” this prey by biting off their heads, wings, legs and abdomens so that their thoraxes – a source of protein – can be fed to the queen's larvae.

So far this year, there have been only two confirmed sightings of yellow-legged hornets in the UK, but “now is the time for people to be on the lookout”, Roy said.

If the government had not destroyed the nests the public has been reporting since 2016, modelling by Exeter University suggests that the hornets would already be established in large areas of England and Wales, and entering Scotland.

Campbell said it was important to try to take photos of suspected Asian hornets and their nests: last year, from more than 29,000 reports, only about 70 were deemed accurate enough to be confirmed sightings. “To be successful with eradication, the National Bee Unit needs to get every single nest,” he said.

New hornet queens are constantly buzzing into the UK from Europe to replace those that have been eradicated. “The Asian hornet can arrive in a lot of different ways. It can come in on fresh produce or within someone's car, across any Channel crossing,” Roy said. “Everyone needs to be vigilant, everywhere.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Senior Kyiv economist describes latest position of Trump administration in talks as ‘colonial-type' bullying

The US has demanded control of a crucial pipeline in Ukraine used to send Russian gas to Europe, according to reports, in a move described as a colonial shakedown.

US and Ukrainian officials met on Friday to discuss White House proposals for a minerals deal. Donald Trump wants Kyiv to hand over its natural resources as “payback” in return for weapons delivered by the previous Biden administration.

Talks have become increasingly acrimonious, Reuters said. The latest US draft is more “maximalist” than the original version from February, which proposed giving Washington $500bn worth of rare metals, as well as oil and gas.

Citing a source close to the talks, the news agency said the most recent document includes a demand that the US government's International Development Finance Corporation take control of the natural gas pipeline.

It runs from the town of Sudzha in western Russia to the Ukrainian city of Uzhhorod, about 750 miles (1,200km) away, on the border with the EU and Slovakia. Built in Soviet times, the pipeline is a key piece of national infrastructure and a major energy route.

On 1 January, Ukraine cut off the supply of gas when its five-year contract with the Russian state energy company Gazprom expired. Both countries had previously earned hundreds of millions of euros in transit fees, including during the first three years of full-scale war.

Volodymyr Landa, a senior economist with the Centre for Economic Strategy, a Kyiv thinktank, said the Americans were out for “all they can get”. Their bullying “colonial-type” demands had little chance of being accepted by Kyiv, he predicted.

Last autumn, Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed giving the US access to Ukraine's underdeveloped mineral sector. He envisaged a deal that would see the incoming Trump administration supply Ukraine with weapons, in return for future profits from joint investments.

Instead, Trump has refused to give security commitments or military support but wants the minerals anyway. Last week he complained Zelenskyy was trying to “back out of an agreement” and said Ukraine's president would have “big problems” if he failed to sign.

Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Zelenskyy said he was ready to do a deal to modernise his country but that Ukraine could only agree if there was “parity” between the two sides, with revenues split “50-50”.

“I am just defending what belongs to Ukraine. It should be beneficial for both the United States and Ukraine. This is the right thing to do,” Zelenskyy said. The US Treasury confirmed “technical” talks were ongoing.

Meanwhile, the US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said his remarks over a possible partition of Ukraine had been misinterpreted. In an interview with the Times, Kellogg said the country could be divided “almost like the Berlin after world war two” as part of a peace deal.

Writing on X, Kellogg said he was referring to “a post-cease fire resiliency force in support of Ukraine's sovereignty”. Under this plan, Russian troops would remain in territory already seized by Moscow, with British and French forces stationed in Kyiv and in other parts of the country.

On Friday, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg. Witkoff's reported solution to the conflict was to give Russia the four Ukrainian provinces it is demanding – including territory that Ukraine controls, and which is home to 1 million people.

Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Ukraine defence contact group on Friday, Kyiv's allies announced a record €21bn (£18.2bn) in additional military help. They accused Putin of dragging his feet over a 30-day ceasefire deal which Ukraine has accepted.

Early on Saturday, Russia carried out further air attacks against Ukrainian civilian targets. Three warehouses were destroyed in Kyiv, with two people injured. The Kremlin has fired 70 missiles and 2,200 drones at Ukraine since the 11 March US ceasefire proposal, Ukrainian officials said.

Zelenskyy paid tribute on Saturday to a 26-year-old pilot, captain Pavlo Ivanov, who was killed during an F-16 combat mission. Ukraine's small air force “heroically” defends the country from Russian missiles and drones, and supported ground operations, he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Critics of policy say residents should be ‘very angry' they will not be able to veto generators in their towns despite promise to consult them

There is a “growing backlash” to the Coalition's nuclear plan, with community groups furious at the lack of consultation and angered that the policy would not give local communities the power of veto and that nuclear plants would be built regardless of local opposition.

Opponents say the pro-nuclear lobby group Nuclear for Australia has been hosting information sessions but that it makes it overly difficult for people to attend and ask questions, and is not able to answer those questions that are posed.

Wendy Farmer, who has formed an alliance of the seven regions affected by the Coalition's pledge to build nuclear reactors on the site of coal-fired power stations, says Australians should be “very angry” that they will not be able to veto any planned nuclear generators in their towns despite the Coalition's promise to carry out a two-and-a-half-year consultation.

She refuses to call the policy a “plan” because of that lack of consultation. “They haven't even looked at these sites,” she said.

Dave Sweeney, the Australian Conservation Foundation's nuclear free campaigner, says it is “more con than consultation”. And he says in his many years in nuclear-free campaigns he has never seen so many sectors – including unions, state leaders, energy producers, businesses and protest groups – aligned against nuclear.

The Coalition has pinpointed Tarong and Callide in Queensland, Liddell and Mount Piper in New South Wales, Loy Yang in Victoria, and small modular reactors (SMRs) in Port Augusta in South Australia and Muja, near Collie in Western Australia.

It says the $331bn nuclear plan will make electricity cheaper, while critics have called its costings a “fantasy”.

The Liberal party did not respond to questions about the lack of consultation and lack of veto power.

The alliance said there “has been no consultation or free prior and informed consent from traditional custodians”.

“You never asked locals if they want nuclear reactors in their back yards, instead you threaten compulsory acquisition and federal overrides with no right to veto,” it said in a petition to the Coalition.

It said the plan was a “distraction” designed to “create false debate” when communities are already transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

Jayla Parkin, a Collie resident and community organiser for Climate Justice Union, said pro-nuclear information sessions had not provided any answers and had tried to stop First Nations people from entering.

Nuclear for Australia has held two information sessions with “expert speakers” in the town.

One elder was “devastated” after initially being refused entrance to a meeting last year, Parkin said. “She wanted to get the information,” Parkin said. “Not everyone is simply for nuclear or against. We are for being informed on what's going to happen.”

At a January meeting, elders were told they couldn't go in because of something wrong with their registrations, which Parkin then sorted out. Once inside, she said questions had to be submitted via an app.

“Not a single question could be answered … like ‘Where is the water coming from?', ‘How will this benefit Collie?', and ‘Where are you going to store the radioactive waste?'” she said.

Since then, the community had heard nothing, she said.

Nuclear for Australia, founded by Will Shackel and boasting the entrepreneur Dick Smith as a patron, describes itself as a grassroots organisation with no political affiliation.

Information sessions have featured Grace Stanke, a nuclear fuels engineer and former Miss America who says being called “Barbenheimer” is one of her favourite compliments.

Shackel told SBS that Nuclear for Australia Google people when they try to register for the sessions.

“If we believe that someone is a known protester … someone who could cause a physical threat to people in there, we will not allow them in,” he said.

Farmer, also the president of Voices of the Valley, said Nuclear for Australia was “silencing people” by only allowing questions through an app and filtering them.

Nuclear for Australia has also taken out ads in local newspapers claiming 77% of coal jobs are transferable to nuclear plants and that nuclear workers are paid 50% more than other power generation-related jobs.

The fine print shows those claims come from a US nuclear industry lobby organisation and refer to the situation in the US.

Farmer said that, “adding insult to injury”, the advertisements misspell Latrobe Valley as La Trobe Valley and, in one case, an ad aimed at Latrobe was put in an SA newspaper.

“Regional communities are desperate for jobs now,” Farmer said. “Nuclear is not the answer.”

Protesters heckled the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, for not meeting with the community when he visited Collie in October last year.

“Collie doesn't like it when people like that come to our town and hide,” Parkin said. “People have questions … at least openly answer them.”

In Perth last week Dutton was asked about criticism from Collie residents that he hadn't heard their concerns about nuclear power and whether he would commit to visiting the town during the election campaign.

“I've been to Collie before,” he said. “There are seven locations around the country, and I won't be able to get to all of them.”

Those communities knew the Coalition was offering them “the ability to transform”, he said.

Greg Bannon is from the Flinders Local Action Group, which was formed to oppose plans to build a nuclear waste dump in SA.

He said the community had not heard much apart from a February information session held by Nuclear for Australia. He said there were concerns about the safety of any power plant and the impact on the local environment. “Port Augusta … is probably the most stupid place to put a nuclear power station in the world,” he said, pointing to the unique nature of Spencer Gulf and its flat “dodge” tides.

“Any leakage … the water would end up in the top end of the gulf, with only one place to go, through Port Lincoln, the fish nurseries, the mangroves … only 50km further south is Point Lowly near Whyalla, where the annual migration of the southern giant cuttlefish occurs, which is a unique event in the world,” he said.

The other point, Bannon said, was that the region had already transitioned away from baseload power to renewables.

Guardian Australia has approached the Coalition and Nuclear for Australia for a response.

Tom Venning was preselected to replace retiring MP Rowan Ramsey in Grey, the federal electorate that Port Augusta sits within. He said he supported the policy as part of a “credible path to net zero” and that if the Coalition formed government there would be a two-and-a-half-year community consultation and an independent feasibility study.

“I'm committed to keeping my community fully informed and involved,” he said, adding that he would take any concerns seriously and would work with local leaders and the energy minister to address them.

Sweeney said the Coalition already appeared to be backing away from its commitment to nuclear and appeared reluctant to bring it up.

On Friday Dutton said people would flock to nuclear if they subsidised it but that they could “subsidise all sorts of energies”.

“I don't carry a candle for nuclear or any other technology,” he said.

Farmer said: “There is a growing backlash.

“We are keeping it as a hot topic – because the Coalition doesn't want to talk about nuclear, we will.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Jonathan Reynolds says allowing British Steel to collapse would have cost £1bn as public ownership looks increasingly likely

Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds is being questioned by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on her Sunday politics programme.

He said the intervention yesterday was “dramatic” but was needed to secure Britain's “economic security” . He said if nothing was done the blast furnaces and steel production in the UK “would have gone”. His officials are on site right now, the business secretary added.

Kuenssberg pressed the minister, asking him if he was sure if he would have the supplies he needed to keep the furnaces at the plant burning. Reynolds refused to be drawn on the commercial specifics.

“Without the decisive action by the government yesterday all was lost,” Reynolds insisted.

The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, declined to guarantee that British Steel will be able to secure enough raw materials in time to keep the Scunthorpe blast furnaces going.

Reynolds also declined to directly accuse the British Steel owner Jingye of sabotaging the plant but it is understood ministers do not expect the company to return to any negotiations.

It came a day after emergency legislation was passed that allows the government to instruct companies to keep loss-making steel operations in England open, or face criminal penalties for their executives.

Reynolds said the government had decided to take emergency action when it learned that Chinese steel making firm Jingye had not only stopped ordering more raw materials, but begun selling off the supplies it already had.

The company had also rejected an offer of support in the region of £500m, instead demanding more than twice that figure with few guarantees the blast furnaces would stay open.

Reynolds said the government expects to lose money running British Steel, but allowing it to collapse would have cost £1bn.

A government source confirmed to the PA agency that Reynolds had given directions to Jingye after the emergency sitting yesterday, but did not specify what those directions were.

There is broad consensus among the opposition parties in support of the government's actions, with the Conservatives backing full nationalisation of the plant.

There still has been no confirmation of plans to fully nationalise the plant in Scunthorpe but public ownership is looking increasingly likely.

Thanks for joining us. We are closing this blog now but you can find all our latest coverage of the British Steel negotiations here.

British Steel's financial difficulties have been made worse by 25% tariffs imposed by Donald Trump on steel and aluminium sales to the US (the UK was hit with 10 percent US tariffs across the board on 2 April, on top of the 25 percent duties on aluminum and steel).

Though Keir Starmer has expressed disappointment at the tariffs, he has not retaliated and is seeking to negotiate them away.

In 2024, the steel industry contributed £1.7bn to the UK economy in terms of gross value added (GVA), which is equivalent to 0.1% of total UK economic output and 0.8% of manufacturing output, according to research published by the House of Commons library.

There are 1,145 businesses in the UK steel industry, supporting 37,000 jobs, but it is under increasing pressure due to a global over-production of steel pushing steel prices down, while British manufacturers face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than many other countries.

The sector has been demanding help from the government on spiralling energy costs and wants the domestic market to be better protected from imported steel from countries with lower environmental production standards. The government said in September it would introduce a new steel strategy this spring, as it aims “to ramp up investment, strengthen our supply chains and create more well-paid jobs in the places where they're most needed”.

Britain's remaining steelmakers are under pressure to reduce carbon emissions amid the impacts of global warming. Most have shifted to electric arc furnaces that make steel from recycled material. That has left Scunthorpe as the only factory with blast furnaces capable of turning iron ore into virgin steel.

The UK's prime minister, Keir Starmer, said yesterday that his government had stepped into “save” British Steel through passing emergency legislation to prevent Jingye shutting down its two blast furnaces in Scunthorpe.

Here is a Starmer's full statement released by Downing Steet on Saturday:

Today, my government has stepped in to save British Steel. We are acting to protect the jobs of thousands of workers, and all options are on the table to secure the future of the industry. Delivering security and renewal for working people is at the heart of my plan for change.

This government is turning the page on a decade of decline, where our manufacturing heartlands were hollowed out by the previous government.

In recent weeks alone, we have announced the expansion of Heathrow airport and the building of the biggest theme park in Europe in Bedford. We are reforming our planning rules to build 1.5 million homes, and the infrastructure the nation desperately needs. New roads, railways, schools, hospitals, grids and reservoirs. British steel will be the backbone as we get Britain building once more.

This is a government of industry. That's why we've secured a better deal for the workers of Port Talbot. It's why we fought to secure the future of Harland & Wolff. It's why we've pledged £200 million to Grangemouth. Our industry is the pride of our history – and I want it to be our future too.

A secure future. A Britain rebuilt with British steel, in the national interest.

The GMB trade union general secretary, Gary Smith, confirmed workers had acted to stop officials from the Chinese company Jingye, which bought British Steel in 2019, from entering the site in Scunthorpe.

“We were worried about industrial vandalism and there was a worry about sabotage on the site, quite frankly,” he told the BBC earlier today. “And yesterday, workers did prevent executives from the Chinese owners from going on site.”

“I'm sure that people are still very worried about that, but these people performed heroics yesterday to ensure that we've got a fighting chance for the steel industry in this country... They were legitimately concerned about industrial sabotage at the plant,” Smith added.

Jasper Jolly, a financial reporter at the Guardian, has written some analysis on the multiple crises British Steel faces as the supplies needed to keep the blast furnaces operating at the Scunthorpe plant are running low. Here is an extract from his piece:

Union leaders representing steelworkers said they were relieved that the government appeared to be moving towards public ownership. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, a former Scunthorpe steelworker and national officer for the GMB union, said nationalisation was “the only way to save the UK steel industry”, and that the ability to direct the company's actions was “the first step in that process”.

Yet even nationalisation will not deliver Scunthorpe's workers from the bigger questions over its long-term future. Jingye had rejected a £500m offer of support to switch to electric arc furnaces – to match aid given to Tata Steel at Port Talbot, south Wales – but Scunthorpe will need to make the switch if it is to have a future in a world of net zero carbon emissions.

As we have been reporting, the Conservatives and Reform have voiced broad support for the government's move to take control of British Steel. But what have other opposition parties said?

The Green party says it supports nationalisation of the steel industry as it could prove to be a “key driver of a green industrial revolution”. The party's co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, told Sky News' Trevor Phillips this morning: “Steel is essential for the transition to a green economy. The Greens have been arguing for decades that we need to have the ability to produce more of the manufactured goods... within our country. And with what we're seeing now with the international political climate and the bullying behaviour of President Trump, it only underlines our point that we need to be able to produce these things more locally.”

Plaid Cymru has accused the UK government for acting to save the Scunthorpe plant but not taking the same action when the Tata Steel works in Port Talbot were threatened with closure. Tata ended primary steelmaking at Port Talbot last September with the closure of its last blast furnace, a decision that was projected to lead to 2,500 job losses. As part of a deal the government committed £500m to help the company move to greener forms of steelmaking. Addressing the Commons at the emergency session yesterday, Liz Saville-Roberts, Plaid's Westminster leader, said yesterday: “Scunthorpe gets security, Port Talbot gets a pittance.”

The Lib Dems' deputy leader Daisy Cooper said recalling parliament yesterday was “absolutely the right thing to do” but the party has also criticised the UK government for not intervening to protect the Port Talbot steelworks in the same way.

The SNP's Stephen Flynn questioned why the legislation only applies to England. He said yesterday: “Why is this not being extended to Scotland? Why is Grangemouth (refinery in Scotland) not being included? Why is the smelter up at Lochaber not being included? Why the DL steelworks not being included? The answer why they are not being included is because westminster is only interested in westminster.”

The shadow business secretary, Andrew Griffith, was the chief business secretary to the then prime minister Boris Johnson during the months in 2019 when British Steel went into administration.

He has defended the move to sell British Steel to Jingye, claiming it was “the only deal at the time”.

Griffith told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips on Sky News:

From my recollection, those conversations had been ongoing for some time. It was led by the secretary of state.

You have got to remember that Jingye was the only bidder at the time. It was a deal that was welcomed by the GMB union, by the community union, and by UK steel. ..

Many people, including the British Steel workers, the unions on the ground, local MPs, all wanted that deal to happen, and it did indeed go on and get investment into Scunthorpe and keep the business going so that there's clearly been a breakdown.

The Reform UK leader Nigel Farage backs the nationalisation of the plant. Here are some of the main takeaways of what he said to Laura Kuenssberg this morning:

He believes nationalisation of the Scunthorpe plant is the right move because he claims the plant's Chinese owner, Jingye, is a “bad actor”.

Farage accused the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of deliberately sabotaging British Steel, but provided no evidence for his claim. “This is a big strategic decision by the CCP,” he said. Asked for his evidence to support that claim, Farage said: “You can call it intuition if you like.”

Farage said, again without evidence, that he was “100% certain they bought British Steel to close British Steel”.

Farage says it is hard to estimate how much it would cost the taxpayer to nationalise British Steel “because we can't trust Jingye's figures” and that the company “artificially inflated” its losses and has not opened its accounts up to proper auditing.

Farage said we are living through an “industrial massacre” and a “complete rethink” about British industry is necessary to protect domestic production and interests.

Reynolds has also been speaking to Sky News' Sunday Morning programme with Trevor Phillips. He has been asked how much it may cost the taxpayer if the government takes ownership and control of British Steel.

Reynolds said the government expects to lose money running British Steel, but allowing it to collapse would have cost £1bn. There still has been no confirmation of plans to nationalise the plant in Scunthorpe but public ownership is looking increasingly likely.

Speaking to Sky News, Reynolds said:

The losses, the annual losses, net losses, in the last set of accounts were £233m. Actually, that can be improved upon, but I am accepting your point that we would expect to lose money on this.

I would ask the public to compare that to the option of spending a lot more money to reach a deal that would have seen a lot of job losses and Jingye remain as a partner.

Or the cost of the complete collapse of British Steel, easily over £1bn in terms of the need to respond from government, to remediate the land, to look after the workforce.

The business secretary said that, as money had already been set aside for the steel industry at the budget, the government would not need to borrow more as a result of the takeover.

He added: “To be absolutely frank, I think supporting British Steel at this time, in that way, is better than spending a greater deal of money on the complete loss of the business or in a transition deal.”

Jingye still owns the site in Scunthorpe, but the steel industry bill published on Saturday gives the government the power to instruct steel companies in England to keep facilities open, with criminal penalties for executives if they fail to comply.

Laura Kuenssberg asks Jonathan Reynolds why the government was so slow in passing the emergency laws to save British Steel (when weeks ago – on 25 March – British Steel said it might have to close the furnaces).

Q:“Why did you let it get to this Thursday when the coal is about to run out that you actually made this decision?”

A:

Because I don't think in any job, in any role in government, you take emergency powers of the scale that happened yesterday until you have that emergency situation.

We have been negotiating in good faith. We have been expecting, as I think is reasonable, an economically rational partner on the other side.

When that became evident that that was not possible that required the kind of significant, dramatic emergency action which was taken yesterday.

For some context: Reynolds has accused British Steel's Chinese owners, Jingye, of failing to negotiate “in good faith” after it decided to stop buying enough raw materials to keep the blast furnaces at Scunthorpe going.

Opening Saturday's debate, Reynolds said Labour had been engaged in negotiations with Jingye since the party came to power last July, and had offered “substantial” support.

The government recently said it offered to buy the necessary raw materials for the blast furnaces but this had been met with a counter-offer from Jingye demanding “an excessive amount” of support.

Reynolds said yesterday:

Over the last few days, it became clear that the intention of Jingye was to refuse to purchase sufficient raw material to keep the blast furnaces running – in fact, their intention was to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders.

The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel-making at British Steel.

Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds is being questioned by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on her Sunday politics programme.

He said the intervention yesterday was “dramatic” but was needed to secure Britain's “economic security” . He said if nothing was done the blast furnaces and steel production in the UK “would have gone”. His officials are on site right now, the business secretary added.

Kuenssberg pressed the minister, asking him if he was sure if he would have the supplies he needed to keep the furnaces at the plant burning. Reynolds refused to be drawn on the commercial specifics.

“Without the decisive action by the government yesterday all was lost,” Reynolds insisted.

My colleague Philip Inman has written a useful explainer on why British Steel – a major supplier to construction firms and Network Rail – needed to be rescued by the government and explores what the next steps may be, with nationalisation looking increasingly likely. Here is an extract from his piece:

Ministers wanted to develop an industrial strategy – that includes domestically produced steel – before allocating any cash to individual sectors. But the crisis at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant brought forward a decision about what kind of steel industry the UK needs.

The plant, which is the last remaining maker of mass-produced virgin steel in England and makes a range of products, from girders for the building sector to train tracks, needs raw materials within the next fortnight, including iron pellets and coking coal, or else it faces the prospect of the furnaces cooling to a point where it is neither easy nor cost-effective to bring them back.

The new legislation, approved by parliament on Saturday, will prevent mass redundancies and manage a transition from blast-furnace-produced steel to electric arc furnaces, which can run on renewable energy.

Good morning and welcome back to our rolling coverage of UK politics.

An emergency bill aimed at saving British Steel's Scunthorpe plant became law yesterday after MPs and peers were recalled from recess to participate in a Saturday sitting for the first time in decades.

They had approved the emergency legislation without opposition, giving the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, the power to require British Steel to keep the Scunthorpe plant going after talks with its Chinese owner, Jingye, broke down.

It has, for now, prevented the imminent collapse of the steelworks and the loss of thousands of jobs.

A government source confirmed to the PA agency that Reynolds had given directions to Jingye after the sitting yesterday, but did not specify what those directions were.

Jingye had said the plant was “no longer financially sustainable” and was losing about £700,000 a day.

While there is general cross party consensus over the government's move to take control of British Steel, the Conservatives said ministers should have acted sooner, with the shadow leader of the house Alex Burghart accusing the government of making “a total pig's breakfast of this whole arrangement”.

Saturday's legislation stopped short of fully nationalising British Steel, instead allowing Reynolds to instruct the company to maintain the blast furnaces, keep staff employed and continue to buy the raw materials needed to make steel, with criminal penalties for executives if they refuse.

Although ministers still hope to secure private sector investment to save the plant, there are no companies offering to take it on and the business secretary conceded to MPs that public ownership was “the likely option”.

The 10% US levy imposed on Australian imports remains but with whom are we to negotiate? Here are our potential interlocutors and those going in to bat for us

Australia, like countries all over the world, now faces the invidious task of negotiating a way around the US's new tariff wall, finding a way into the good graces of an administration that has proven itself capricious, especially with allies.

The 10% tariff rate imposed on all Australian imports has not been paused and Australia's negotiating position is complicated by a federal election: the government is in caretaker mode, and those seeking to “make a deal” may not have that responsibility next month.

But beyond Australia's own uncertainty, in dealing with the US there is the question of with whom to negotiate.

Trade officials and diplomats agree Australia needs to bring discipline and unity to negotiations with a US administration that is its opposite.
 Multiple sources on both sides of the Pacific say the president is most swayed by the “last voice in the room”, underscoring the imperative for Australia to present a consistent message to the key figures who might have the president's ear.

If it needed further demonstration, the week has showcased the unvarnished reality of an erratic global superpower. In an administration so unpredictable, where does the first phone call go and who has the final say?

President of the United States

The extraordinary “liberation day” announcement was just the beginning: a comprehensive global tariff regime (with some notable exceptions) triggered a stock market crash, followed by the announcement of a 90-day pause on (almost) all tariffs, which saw the stock market soaring and then sinking again, followed by an escalation with China.

China has been hit with an increased tariff of 145%, while other tariffs will be “paused” – reduced to the 10% “baseline” rate imposed on Australia, the UK and others.

Despite Australia having a free-trade agreement (ratified in 2005) and running a trade deficit with the US (a surplus from the American position), Trump's position is Australia deserves to be hit with tariffs because of trade barriers he regards as protectionist.

“Australia bans – and they're wonderful people and wonderful everything – but they ban American beef. And, you know, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing right now, starting at midnight tonight,” he said on 3 April.

Despite extraordinary financial tumult in the days since, Trump told a fundraising dinner this week the tariffs were working as a negotiating tool to bend other countries to his will. He said in the wake of the tariff announcement – but before they'd come into effect and crashed the stock market – that he'd been flooded with entreaties from foreign leaders.

“These countries are calling me up, kissing my ass, [saying] ‘Make a deal, please, please, sir, make a deal, I'll do anything, I'll do anything, sir.'”

US secretary of commerce

The famously combative Lutnick (the New Republic ran a piece this week headlined Everybody Hates Howard Lutnick), has been a key spear-carrier for Trump's tariff regime, though his own views on their effectiveness are said to be “more nuanced” than his regular television appearances would suggest.

Lutnick has singled out Australia for criticism over its trading relationship with the US.

“Our farmers are blocked from selling almost anywhere. Europe won't let us sell beef, Australia won't let us sell beef,” Lutnick told a television interview. He dismissed Australian arguments the beef restriction was made for biosecurity reasons.

“This is nonsense. This is all nonsense. What happens is they block our markets.”

Lutnick told Fox News he was in the room week when Trump offered an olive branch of potential “bespoke” negotiations – country by country – to dismantle the tariff walls.

“They started calling and making real offers, finally, finally really digging in and understanding how they treat the US unfairly and really offering us a clear path to where we could do really good deals with these countries.”

Trump has put a 90-day pause on the imposition of tariffs above 10%, except on China. Beijing's refusal to countenance negotiation, Lutnick said, meant it was treated with the opposite to a pause on tariffs: further tariff hikes – to 145% – a rate so high it is, in practice, effectively a trade embargo.

“Donald Trump is the best negotiator that there is.”

Director of the office of trade and manufacturing policy

The man who went to jail rather than give evidence to Congress about the January 6 insurrection is also a fierce advocate for the president's tariff regime and an equally vociferous critic of Australia.

He singled out aluminium imports from Australia as being exploitative.

“The era of unchecked imports undermining American industry is over,” he wrote in USA Today. “The United States will no longer be a dumping ground for heavily subsidised and unfairly traded aluminum.”

Navarro compared Australia to “strategic competitors” China and Russia.

“Nations considered US allies also have been a big part of the problem. Consider Australia. Its heavily subsidised smelters operate below cost, giving them an unfair dumping advantage, while Australia's close ties to China further distort global aluminum trade.”

Navarro has argued Trump's tariff regime would end the unfair exploitation of the US.

“Australia is just killing our aluminum market,” he told CNN. “President Trump says, ‘No, no we're not doing that any more.'”

He accused Australia of “flooding” the US market, “killing” it and leaving the American domestic industry “on its back”.

In 2024 Australian aluminium accounted for less than 2% of US aluminium imports.

Navarro has previously quoted a fictional character, Ron Vara – an anagram of his own surname – as a source of economic wisdom. Elon Musk this week said Navarro was “dumber than a sack of bricks”.

US trade representative

His office produces an annual barriers to trade report, which for 2025 singled out Australian biosecurity laws, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and social media regulation as unfair Australian trade practices.

Greer has been, along with Lutnick and Navarro, a spear-carrier for the tariff regime.

Under questioning before the Senate finance committee, Greer said that, despite a free-trade agreement, Australia harmed US through non-tariff trade barriers.

“We're addressing the $1.2tn deficit – the largest in human history – that President [Joe] Biden left us with. We should be running up the score against Australia.

“Despite the agreement, they ban our beef, they ban our pork. They're getting ready to impose measures on our digital companies.”

Greer also told the committee: “Australia has the lowest rate available under the new program.”

This is not correct.

Russia, Belarus, North Korea and Cuba were all exempted from the tariff regime.

Administration insistence that Russia was exempted because it does no “meaningful trade” with the US are also not correct.

According to statistics from Greer's own office, Russia did $3.5bn worth of trade in 2024.

Senator for Virginia

The Democratic senator was the man questioning Greer in the Senate finance committee.

“On Australia, we have a trade surplus with Australia, we have a free-trade agreement, they are an incredibly important national security partner – why were they whacked with a tariff?”

When Greer responded that Australia imposed biosecurity bans on some US meats and plans to regulate American tech giants, Warner was livid in riposte.

“Sir, you're a much smarter person than that answer: the idea that we are going to whack friend and foe alike, and particularly friends with this level, is both, I think, insulting the Australians, undermines our national security and, frankly, makes us not a good partner going forward.”

Co-chair of the Congressional Friends of Australia Caucus

A longtime advocate for Australia and its alliance with the US (rewarded with an Order of Australia for his services, no less), Courtney has described the tariffs imposed on Australia as an “insult”.

“Australia is a key strategic ally for our country. They are positioned in the Indo-Pacific at a place where, again, tensions are sky high,” Courtney said.

“Instead, what we're seeing is a completely needless, almost insult to the people of Australia by raising tariffs on Australian products coming into this country.”

Australian former golfer

The two-time major winner, who dined with Anthony Albanese on “liberation day” eve, has said he is willing to once again act as a diplomatic conduit between Australia and Trump personally. The US president, a lover of golf, has played regular rounds with the former world No 1.

In 2016 Norman reportedly passed on Trump's personal phone number to the then Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, after Trump unexpectedly won the US presidential election but couldn't be contacted by the Australian government.

“If I can give one tiny bit of help that can help going forward between our two nations, I would do it,” he said last month. “I've done it in the past; I would do it again.”

Norman said Trump was aware of the significance of the US-Australia relationship.

“He understands the extremely tight connection between Australia and the US, [which] I call big brother-little brother, that's how I worded it with him. And I said the importance of that has been decades and decades old, and it's not going to go anywhere.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Amid a series of sadistic expulsions, the White House says Trump has reflected kicking Americans out of the country

They're rounding people up, and you could be next. The Trump administration has largely dispensed with due process rights in deporting immigrants, who are now being targeted for their protected speech, having their visas or green cards summarily cancelled without process and sometimes without notice, and getting kidnapped off the streets and hustled into vans so that they can be shipped to “detention centers” too far away for their loved ones, or their lawyers, to visit them.

Some immigrants are being targeted for disappearance because they oppose Israel's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza, an opinion that it is now physically dangerous, instead of merely unpopular, to hold. But others the government seems to be seizing almost at random. More than 200 Venezuelan nationals have been seized and deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador, rendered outside of US jurisdiction in defiance of judges' orders demanding that their deportation flights be stopped. Of those Venezuelans, most had no criminal record. Other deportees, like the Maryland father and sheet metal worker Kilmar Abrego García, seem to have been deported by mistake; the Trump administration says that Abrego García, who they admit they did not mean to deport, will not be brought back to his family in the United States. Conveniently, the fact that they have deported him to a foreign prison is supposed, in the Trump administration's logic, to absolve them of responsibility for putting him there. “We suggest the judge contact [Salvadoran] President Bukele because we are unaware of the judge having jurisdiction or authority over the country of El Salvador,” the White House said, obnoxiously, after a judge ordered them to bring Abrego García back.

Meanwhile, the sadism of the deportations, and the cruelty of the Salvadoran prison where the men are being kept, seem to hold a kind of aesthetic appeal for the Trump camp. The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, recently flew to the El Salvador prison for a photoshoot with the captives there, where she stood in front of a crowd of men packed into a cell behind bars with her hair coiffed in long beachy waves.

Now, the Trump administration may be seeking to extend the lawlessness and cruelty of its deportation regime to the next logical target: American citizens. The White House spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed on Tuesday that the Trump administration is considering pathways to deport citizens as well. “The president has discussed this idea quite a few times publicly. He's also discussed it privately. You're referring to the president's idea for American citizens to potentially be deported,” she said. “The president has said, if it's legal, if there is a legal pathway to do that, he's not sure.”

This would be illegal. But so is so much of what the Trump administration is doing with its deportation policies. It is illegal to cancel visas and green cards without due process, as the Trump administration has done and continues to do as part of a widening dragnet in its anti-immigrant purges. It is illegal to target immigrants for their speech, as the Trump administration has done to pro-Palestinian and anti-genocide activists, from Rümeysa Öztürk to Mahmoud Khalil. It is illegal to deport people to a foreign prison where they have no recourse to enforce their rights and no path to pursue their freedom – it is illegal to do this, as the Trump administration has done, specifically to prevent its victims from seeking to enforce their own rights in American courts. And it is illegal to ignore the binding orders of federal judges to stop all of this conduct in order to ensure that the deportations can continue, punishing innocent people, silencing protected speech, and scaring whole populations out of work, travel, political participation or any of the other daily dignities that they are supposed to be entitled to in this country.

But the law, increasingly, is whatever the Trump administration decides it is. And there is no force that seems prepared to make them obey the law when their will does not incline them to do so.

That is because the supreme court has been no help, and if anything has acted, so far, as all but an accomplice to Trump's dismantling of the rule of law in his pursuit of anti-immigrant vengeance. Lower court judges have attempted to intervene on behalf of the disappeared immigrants, issuing orders commanding the Trump administration to stop deportations under a long-dormant 1798 wartime measure known as the Alien Enemies Act, and to return Abrego García to the US immediately. But the supreme court has stepped in to pause these orders, allowing the Trump administration's deportation agenda to continue. In the Abrego García case, the court weakened a district court order to “effectuate” the innocent man's freedom and return to a mere command that they “facilitate” it, and only in ways that don't interfere with the executive branch's foreign policy prerogatives – in practice, a weakening of the demand to bring Abrego García back home to a request that the Trump administration provide more plausible deniability when they refuse to do so. And while Brett Kavanaugh weighed in with a concurrence to make a pious declaration of the need for due process in deportation proceedings, the court's actions speak louder than its words: they are allowing the kidnapping and deportation of US residents to continue without due process.

The legal precedents being established in these immigration disappearance cases have no limiting principles: if visa holders, asylum seekers and legal permanent residents can be snatched and deported with effectively no practicable recourse to due process protections, then there is no reason why citizens can't be. It is in the interest of every American citizen to take an active stand in defense of our immigrant neighbors. Because once the Trump administration decides that they have no rights, then neither do we.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

            • Trump's tariffs: President Donald Trump's trade war with China is deepening, while the clock ticks on a 90-day pause to negotiate trade deals with dozens of other countries he's threatened with steep tariffs. A new exemption for imported electronics could provide major relief for US tech giants like Apple.
    


            • Iran talks: US and Iranian officials said high-stakes nuclear talks that began Saturday in Oman were “constructive.” The two sides have agreed to meet again next weekend.
    


            • Fight night: The president — along with his ally Elon Musk — attended UFC 314 in Miami, underscoring the way his ties to combat sports and the surrounding culture helped him appeal to young men in the 2024 election.
    


            • Immigration crackdown: Legal battles continue surrounding the case of a mistakenly deported Maryland man, revoked visas for international students, and others swept up in the Trump administration's widespread immigration crackdown.
    


Our live coverage of Donald Trump's presidency has moved here.



            President Donald Trump arrived to raucous applause at the Kaseya Center in Miami tonight, participating in the “walkout” traditionally reserved for athletes as he became the first sitting president to attend a UFC event.
    


            He was joined by close ally Elon Musk, along with top administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and FBI Director Kash Patel. Trump's granddaughter Kai Trump and grandsons Donald Trump III and Spencer Trump also accompanied the president.
    


            The president was spotted embracing UFC CEO Dana White, as well as podcast host Joe Rogan and basketball legend Shaquille O'Neal on the arena floor.
    


Some context: Trump's attendance at the late-night fight underscores his reemergence in the American pop cultural mainstream as he deploys the trappings of office to attend some of the nation's premier sporting events. It also highlights his loyal ties to the UFC organization and the alignment between the mixed martial arts brand and the young men who propelled Trump back to the White House.
    


            President Donald Trump on Saturday stopped short of endorsing a candidate in the Republican Senate primary in Texas, as state Attorney General Ken Paxton is set to challenge incumbent Sen. John Cornyn next year.
    


                    “They're both good friends of mine, and … we don't know who else is running. But these two, Ken, John, they're both friends of mine, so I'll make a determination at the right time,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he traveled to Miami for a UFC fight.
                





            CNN previously reported that Senate Republicans, who think a Trump endorsement can help clear the field, have personally asked the president to back Cornyn.
    


            Paxton, a hardline conservative and close Trump ally, announced his run Tuesday.
    


            Cornyn, who has announced he's running for a fifth term, told CNN last week that he is “prepared” for a primary fight.
    


            The GOP field could get larger as Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt has privately signaled that he is considering joining the race.
    


            CNN's Kaanita Iyer contributed to this post.
    


            President Donald Trump declined to weigh in substantively on high-stakes talks in Oman to reach a new nuclear deal with Iran, telling reporters aboard Air Force One that discussions are “going OK.”
    


                    “I think they're going OK,” Trump said Saturday while en route to a UFC fight in Miami. “Nothing matters until you get it done. So, I don't like talking about it. But it's going OK. The Iran situation is going pretty good, I think.”
                





            US special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff “conducted talks today in Muscat with Iranian Foreign Minister Dr. Abbas Araghchi, which were hosted by Omani Foreign Minister Said Badr,” the White House said in a statement earlier Saturday, describing the discussions as “direct communication” and “very positive and constructive.”
    


            Trump has warned that failure to reach a deal could lead to potential military strikes on Iran. Tehran, in turn, has warned that any attack on it would drag the US into a broader Middle Eastern conflict.
    


            Sources involved in the talks have told CNN that the Trump administration wants to move fast — and the two parties are expected to meet again for further discussion next Saturday, according to the White House.
    


            Trump also weighed in on ongoing talks with Russia and Ukraine, one day after Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin for more than four hours.
    


                    “I think Ukraine-Russia might be going OK. And you're going to be finding out pretty soon. You know, there's a point at which you have to either put up or shut up. We'll see what happens, but I think it's going fine,” he said.
                





            President Donald Trump said he is “looking forward” to his Monday meeting with El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele at the White House and praised the leader for housing “the most violent alien enemies of the world” in his nation's mega-prison.
    


                    “Looking forward to seeing President Bukele, of El Salvador, on Monday! Our Nations are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity. President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation's custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States. These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government. They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!” Trump posted on Truth Social.
                





            The president's post comes after the Supreme Court ruled this week that the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of the Maryland man and El Salvadoran national who was mistakenly deported to CECOT, the country's mega-prison. However, the high court stopped short of requiring his return to the United States.
    


            Earlier today, the Department of Justice said in a filing that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia “is alive and secure” at the mega-prison after days of saying it doesn't have information about his exact location.
    


            Trump did not mention Abrego Garcia in his post.
    


            The Trump administration said in a filing today that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland father who was mistakenly deported, is alive and remains in an El Salvador mega-prison.
    


                    “It is my understanding based on official reporting from our Embassy in San Salvador that Abrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador,” a senior State Department official wrote in the filing. “He is alive and secure in that facility.”
                





            Earlier this week, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States but stopped short of requiring it.
    


            On Friday, US District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Justice Department to provide daily updates on what the administration is doing to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, after a DOJ attorney could not provide details on exactly where he is.
    


            Saturday's filing did not include details on the administration's efforts to bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.
    


Correction: This post has been updated to reflect that a State Department official wrote the filing.



            President Donald Trump is set to attend UFC 314 in Miami, where Australian Alexander Volkanovski is set to take on Diego Lopes of Brazil in tonight's featherweight title bout.
    


            His attendance at the late-night fight underscores his reemergence in the American pop cultural mainstream as he deploys the trappings of office to attend some of the nation's premier sporting events.
    


            It also highlights his long and loyal ties to the UFC organization and its CEO, Dana White, and the alignment between the mixed martial arts brand and the young men who propelled Trump back to the White House.
    


            With the exception of nearly weekly trips to his Mar-a-Lago property in South Florida, the president's domestic travel has been rare during his second term. But since taking office, he has flown aboard Air Force One to attend the Super Bowl in New Orleans, the Daytona 500 in Daytona Beach, and the NCAA men's wrestling championships in Philadelphia.
    


            Trump, who has long styled himself a “fighter,” successfully tapped into the male-oriented podcast sphere during his 2024 campaign, boosting his turnout among low-propensity voters as he and top surrogates leaned into interviews with host Joe Rogan, Barstool Sports' “Bussin' With The Boys,” and Andrew Schulz's “Flagrant,” among others, offering listeners long-form, unfiltered and un-fact-checked conversations.
    


            Many male-oriented podcasters discuss physical fitness, promote traditional traits of masculinity and share an appreciation for mixed martial arts, specifically UFC.
    


            White emerged as a key surrogate for Trump in 2024 as his campaign sought to bolster its appeal to young men.
    


            Today's talks between US envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi took place in the home of Omani Foreign Minister Badr Al Busaidi, known as Bait Al Hail, according to a source familiar with the meeting.
    


            The residence is located less than 10 minutes from the Muscat airport and has been viewed as an attractive gathering place for senior level government officials from the West and the Middle East.
    


            The grandiose entryway at the home has reception rooms on each side. To the right is the Western-style reception room where Witkoff and his team were based during the indirect talks; to the left is the Oriental-style reception room where Araghchi and the Iranian team were located, the source explained.
    


            In total 13 people took part in the talks: 5 Americans, 5 Iranians and 3 Omanis, the source said. The Omanis shuttled messages in English between the two sides.
    


            After the talks ended, the two delegations spoke for just a few minutes in the marble hallway on the way out, the source said.
    


            Based on the readout from the White House sources involved in the talks, there is a belief the Trump administration wants to move fast and that Witkoff wants to make a political decision to green-light a deal without diving into highly technical details which could slow things down, the source said.
    


            The US-Iran meeting set for next week is likely to take place in Europe, the source said.
    


            The Trump administration is the target of a new federal lawsuit seeking to stop the revocation of visas issued to international students.
    


            The lawsuit, filed by Kuck Baxter, an Atlanta-based legal firm specializing in immigration, is seeking to stop federal officials from deporting the students.
    


            Attorney Dustin Baxter told CNN his firm filed the lawsuit on behalf of about 20 international students, but the case may grow to include around 200. The students currently included are mainly studying at Georgia colleges and universities.
    


            The lawsuit specifically names three Trump administration officials as defendants: US Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House and DHS for comment.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio has repeatedly said that some behavior, including participating in protests, will not be tolerated by students on visas. “They're here to go to class. They're not here to lead activist movements that are disruptive and undermine our universities. I think it's lunacy to continue to allow that,” Rubio said.
    


            But Baxter said the Trump administration is going well beyond targeting activists — who, he adds, also shouldn't be targeted unless they commit a crime, given the right for citizens and noncitizens to peacefully protest.
    


            The lawyer claims the Trump administration is going through logs of student visas and finding anyone with “any kind of encounter with a police officer.”
    


            “Even if there was no conviction, if there was just an arrest — and sometimes there wasn't even an arrest, there was just an encounter and maybe a ticket — they would revoke the student visa,” Baxter told CNN.
    


            The Trump administration this week imposed a minimum tariff rate of 145% on Chinese goods imported to the United States.
    


            Dan Mitchell, the founder of a Tennessee home building company who voted for Trump and said he supports the administration's ultimate goal, joined CNN's Jake Tapper to discuss how the tariffs might affect his business and the housing industry nationwide.

            The White House is characterizing today's nuclear talks between a top Trump adviser and Iran's foreign minister as a step in the right direction and has confirmed plans for follow-up talks next week.
    


            The “direct communication” between President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was “very positive and constructive,” the White House said in a statement.
    


            Witkoff “underscored to Dr. Araghchi that he had instructions from President Trump to resolve our two nations' differences through dialogue and diplomacy, if that is possible,” the statement said, calling the talks a “step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome.”
    


            The US statement thanked Oman for its mediating role in the talks, and noted that the US ambassador to Oman, Ana Escrogima, was also present.
    


            The White House said the two sides plan meet again next Saturday.
    


            In comments reported by Iranian media earlier today, Tehran similarly described the talks as “constructive” and shared the plans for more discussions next week.
    


Remember: The high-stakes talks come after Trump threatened military strikes against Iran if it did not agree to a new deal, which prompted a warning from Tehran that any attack would drag the US into a broader Middle Eastern conflict.
    


            Trump has given Tehran a two-month deadline to accept a deal that would lead to Iran shrinking its nuclear footprint or eliminating its program altogether.
    


            After exempting several high-tech products from steep new tariffs, the White House says President Donald Trump continues to urge firms to move production to the United States.
    


                    “President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops. That's why the President has secured trillions of dollars in U.S. investments from the largest tech companies in the world, including Apple, TSMC, and Nvidia. At the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.
                





            US Customs and Border Protection posted a notice last night saying smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts are among the exempted products. That could be huge news for US tech giants like Apple, which bases an estimated 90% of its iPhone production and assembly in China.
    


            “The President has stated that autos, steel, pharmaceuticals, chips and other specific materials will be included in specific tariffs to ensure tariffs are applied fairly and effectively,” a White House official said.
    


            The official said Trump would soon order up a study on the national security effects on semiconductor imports.
    


            The Department of Homeland Security has administered lie detector tests to about 50 staffers in recent weeks, including FEMA's acting administrator and roughly a dozen officials at the disaster relief agency, as part of an intensifying effort to root out what the department alleges are leaks of national security information.
    


            At least one FEMA official has been placed on administrative leave and was escorted out of the agency's office this week after being administered a polygraph test, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.
    


            “We are agnostic about your standing, tenure, political appointment, or status as a career civil servant — we will track down leakers and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an email to CNN.
    


            The investigations at DHS have raised concerns that the lie detector tests may be used on federal workers accused of leaking non-classified information to the media, particularly at FEMA, where sources say classified information is handled in very limited circumstances.
    


            Whistleblower support organizations tell CNN it would be unusual, alarming and potentially illegal for the tests to be used in such cases.

            The second round of nuclear talks between Iranian and American negotiators will be held next Saturday in Oman, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state media, adding that today's meeting “got very close” to reaching a framework for negotiations.
    


                    “The atmosphere in today's meeting was such that it ensured continuity and progress,” Araghchi told state broadcaster IRIB. “If we can finalize the basis (of talks) in the next session, I believe we will have made significant progress.”
                





            He added that both sides said they are seeking an agreement in the shortest time possible.
    


            Araghchi was asked about his brief meeting with US President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, which was the first direct contact between US and Iranian officials during Trump's second term.
    


            “When both parties were leaving, we spent a few minutes conversing,” the foreign minister said. “This is an accepted norm. We always adhere to diplomatic norms when dealing with US diplomats and this time we also exchanged the same level of pleasantries.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment.
    


            Richard Grenell, the controversial interim president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, says President Donald Trump will attend the opening of “Les Misérables” in June and host a fundraiser at the venue.
    


            Grenell is touting Trump's overhaul of the center, saying in an interview this morning that the president's purge of the cultural institution's board and targeting of programming the administration deems unsuitable is saving money.
    


            “We've done a hiring freeze, we've fired a lot of the bloat, and we've saved about $6.2 million in eight weeks already,” Grenell claimed during a “Fox & Friends” appearance. “Donald Trump is coming to the opening of ‘Les Mis' on June 11. He's doing a fundraiser for the Kennedy Center. We expect to raise millions for that. So, he personally is turning this around.”
    


            Grennell added that Trump has tasked him with going to Capitol Hill to speak with senators about how to “turn around” the Kennedy Center.
    


            “First of all, we got to get more donors. We got to get — everyone needs to be included. We don't need to be booing Republicans, like if the vice president shows up,” he said, referring to a recent visit from Vice President JD Vance and his wife Usha in which attendees could be heard booing them.



            Delegations from Iran and the United States will meet again next week after wrapping up “constructive” nuclear talks that included the first direct contact between Trump administration and Iranian officials, according to Iran's state news agency.
    


            The two sides shared their views on Iran's nuclear program and the potential lifting of sanctions against the Islamic Republic through Omani Foreign Minister Badr Al Busaidi, “in a constructive atmosphere based on mutual respect,” according to the report from state-run IRNA.
    


            “After more than two and a half hours of indirect negotiations, the heads of the Iranian and American delegations spoke for a few minutes in the presence of the Omani foreign minister as they left the talks,” IRNA added.
    


            CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment.
    


            Oman's foreign minister said on X that he was proud to facilitate the talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, which were aimed at reaching a “fair and binding” agreement.
    


Remember: Today's high-stakes talks are aimed at securing a potential new nuclear deal between the two countries and easing tensions in the region.
    


            The talks came in the wake of President Donald Trump's threat of military strikes if Iran fails to agree to a pact — and Tehran's warning that any attack would drag the US into a broader Middle Eastern conflict.
    


            Trump has given Tehran a two-month deadline to accept a deal that would lead to Iran shrinking its nuclear footprint or eliminating its program altogether.

            Electronics including phones and computers imported to the United States will be exempt from President Donald Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs, according to a US Customs and Border Protection notice posted yesterday.
    


            Smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts are among the exempted products. The exemption applies to products entering the US or removed from warehouses as early as April 5, according to the notice.
    


            The move comes after the Trump administration imposed a minimum tariff rate of 145% on Chinese goods. The tariffs would have a major impact on tech giants like Apple, which make iPhones and other products in China.
    


            Roughly 90% of Apple's iPhone production and assembly is based in China, according to Wedbush Securities' estimates.
    


            Trump had told reporters yesterday on Air Force One that there could be possible exclusions to his sweeping tariffs.
    


            The White House has not responded to a CNN request for comment.
    


This post has been updated with additional details on the exemptions.



            Several universities in Florida have signed agreements to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of an ongoing push by state leaders to aid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.
    


            The University of Florida confirmed yesterday it has signed an agreement that allows local law enforcement to act as immigration officers.
    


            The arrangements, known as 287(g) agreements, allow local officers to question those they suspect of being in the country illegally and to execute arrest warrants for immigration violations, according to a statement from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in February.
    


            The University of Central Florida and the University of South Florida have also signed the pacts with ICE, according to CNN affiliate WFTV.
    


            CNN reached out to Florida International University and Florida Atlantic University about news reports that their campus police have done the same.
    


            The prospect of increased immigration enforcement could cause additional friction on the University of Florida campus. On Wednesday, crowds gathered there to protest the deportation of a Colombian student, according to CNN affiliate WCJB.



The big picture: By CNN's count, more than 500 students, faculty and researchers across the US have had their visas revoked this year, including at least four University of Florida students.
    


            An increasing number of student deportation threats involve the revocation of visas based on relatively minor offenses like years-old misdemeanors.
    


            China warned yesterday that the United States' tariffs could spark a “humanitarian crisis,” as the world's two largest economies continue their tit-for-tat in US President Donald Trump's trade war.
    


                    “The United States' ‘reciprocal tariffs' will inflict great harm on developing countries, especially the least developed countries, and even trigger a humanitarian crisis,” Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said during a Friday video call with the director-general of the World Trade Organization.
                





            In a statement by the ministry today, Wang said Trump's tariffs have “brought great uncertainty and instability to the world.”
    


            The statement said Wang stressed to WTO members that they should stand firm against “unilateralism, protectionism and bullying.”
    


Another US rival weighs in on trade: Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said today that the WTO has been “paralyzed” by successive American administrations and that tariff deals must now be struck fairly.
    


            “The tariff war which we witness now is going to change many things. We hear that many countries would like to sit down with the United States and negotiate,” Lavrov said during an address at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkey.
    


            “We would only be happy if people reach some deals peacefully and to their mutual satisfaction,” he said.
    


            Welcome to today's live coverage of President Donald Trump's administration.
    


            We'll be tracking developments on the president's trade war and the high-stakes US-Iran talks taking place in Oman.

            Iran and the United States begin high-stakes talks to reach a new nuclear deal today.
    


            This comes in the wake of President Donald Trump's threat of military strikes if Iran fails to agree to a pact — and Tehran's warning that any attack would drag the US into a broader Middle Eastern conflict.
    


            The meeting, being held in the Gulf Arab nation of Oman, could be the first direct talks between Iranian and American officials in a decade, though Iran insists they will be indirect, with mediators acting as go-betweens for the two nations.
    


            Trump has given Tehran a two-month deadline to accept a deal that would lead to Iran shrinking its nuclear footprint or eliminating its program altogether.
    


            “I want them not to have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be a wonderful, great, happy country, but they can't have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said aboard Air Force One on his way to Florida last night.
    


What we've heard so far today: Iran is seeking an “initial understanding” with the US that could lead to a negotiations process, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation to the talks, said upon arriving in the Omani capital Muscat.
    


            It's “too early” to speak about a timetable for the discussions, which depends on “sufficient will on both sides,” he said.
    


            An Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said indirect talks are underway, with plans for the parties to be seated in separate rooms and convey their views to each other through the Omani foreign minister.
    


            The atmosphere in the talks is positive, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, citing a member of the negotiating team. It added that negotiations are unlikely to be extended into Sunday.
    


            CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment.
    


This post has been updated with additional comments from Iran.



            President Donald Trump and his advisers claim this was the plan all along: Announce astronomically high tariffs, get countries to come to the negotiating table, and — with the exception of China — then back off in order to work out new trade agreements.
    


            But Trump's 90-day pause on his “reciprocal” tariffs gives the administration just three months to strike enormously complex trade deals with dozens of countries.
    


            Financial markets aren't buying it. Stocks have whipsawed as volatility has spiked. And other markets are sending a clear message of deep skepticism that Trump will be able to pull this one off.
    


Where things left off Friday: Following another steep sell-off Thursday, stocks appeared calmer — for now — and posted strong gains Friday.
    


            The Dow ended the day higher by 619 points, or 1.56%. The S&P 500 rose 1.81% and the Nasdaq was 2.06% higher.
    


            But warning signs continued flashing from other markets, including oil, bonds and the dollar. And investors have been trading on a knife's edge, with any announcement from Trump liable to send stocks surging or tumbling.
    


What comes next: The Trump administration is voicing optimism, saying dozens of countries have reached out to strike a deal. The administration is providing few details on any ongoing talks, but has said it will favor allies like South Korea and Japan first.
    


            But trade deals are incredibly complex arrangements usually negotiated over the course of years, not months.
    


China looms: Even if Trump struck deals with all those countries over a short period, China — the world's biggest exporter — remains the elephant in the room.
    


            Beijing is locked in a tit-for-tat battle with Washington, with Trump not only excluding China from his tariff pause but also raising tariffs on the country to at least 145%.
    


            Chinese leader Xi Jinping said he is “not afraid” in his first public comments on the escalating trade war, and has raised tariffs on US goods to 125%.

When the first two rounds of 10% tariffs hit, Zou Guoqing, a Chinese exporter, groaned but didn't find the barriers insurmountable. He gave up some of his profits and offered his client, a snow-bike factory in Nebraska, price cuts ranging from 5% to 10%. It seemed to work: The factory agreed to a new order of molds and parts.

But when President Donald Trump announced an additional 34% universal tariff on Chinese goods on April 2, Zou, who has been exporting to the United States for more than a decade, was incredulous. 

“There's not a thread of feasibility,” said Zou, who does business in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo. “It looks like I would have no choice but give up trading with the U.S.”

Then came 50% more from Trump, followed by another increase that pushed the universal tariff on Chinese goods to 145%, and Zou said he now could only hope that Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping can communicate. “We are pausing the shipments,” he said, “until the leaders talk.”

That U.S. tariff and the retaliatory 125% tariff from China are putting businesses that trade between the U.S. and China on edge. They are fretting not only about their next orders but also their viability if there is no quick relief. Experts are worried the decades-long trade ties that have underpinned the relationship between the world's two largest economies could be unraveling.




If the high tariff is sustained for the next six months or longer, “that would actually lead to a real effective decoupling between the American and Chinese economies,” said Chen Zhiwu, professor of finance at Hong Kong University Business School.

Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, said the tariff, if kept in place, amounts to “almost a trade embargo,” making it impossible for China to export low-value items such as apparel to the U.S. It also would force U.S. businesses to source elsewhere, away from China, if there should be alternatives, he said. 

The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics such as smartphones and laptops from the reciprocal tariffs, which means they won't be subject to the 145% tariffs levied on China. The exemption seemed to reflect Trump's realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon.

In China, the central tariff office declared there was “no possibility for market acceptance” of U.S. goods exported to China at the current tariff level.

“Everyone's pretty worried,” said Hu Jianlong, founder of Brands Factory, a consultancy that works with Chinese companies trying to break into overseas markets. “At this point in time, there's no good way forward. This situation has not resolved ... there's no final number. And so everyone's still waiting to see how this will develop.”

The tariff war has come more than 20 years after China, with the help of the United States, joined the World Trade Organization and began to see its economy soar on luring foreign investments and exporting to the U.S. and other Western markets. By last year, China-U.S. trade was $582 billion, but tensions have flared over China's widening trade imbalance with the U.S. That led to the first tariff skirmish during the first Trump term.

The trade deficit has since narrowed but stayed stubbornly high, at a time when the U.S. and other Western markets have also grown concerned about another onslaught of Chinese products such as electric vehicles.

During his term, Democratic President Joe Biden stressed that the U.S. was not trying to decouple from China but to “de-risk.” He took the “small-yard, high-fence” approach, under which his administration put up barriers in targeted sectors such as advanced chips, artificial intelligence and quantum computing that have national security implications.

Now, Trump is declaring universal tariffs on Chinese goods but has said he's also willing to talk with Beijing. It remains unclear what the Republican president's goals might be.

“What are they looking for in those negotiations? How much is it possible to reduce these tariffs? What are the other demands apart from China removing its retaliatory tariffs that the United States wants to put forward. We don't know what that would be,” said Greta Peisch, who served as the general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in 2021-2024.

The message from China's leadership is loud and clear. It will talk only when the U.S. stops “maximum pressure and capricious and destructive behavior,” said Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson.

Li Cheng, professor of political science at the University of Hong Kong, said the Chinese leadership is upset over being singled out by Trump when the U.S. president paused reciprocal tariffs for 90 days for all other countries. Beijing wants to make sure that “Donald Trump not state one thing in the morning and say other things in the evening,” Li said, and that Trump's policies on China are not hijacked by his anti-China, hawkish advisers.

With no leadership-level negotiations in the immediate future, businesses are exploring their options.

Lisa Li, who works in sales for an athletic wear manufacturer in the northern Chinese province of Hebei, said her business was negotiating with clients over whether they could split the increased costs. It's too early to say if her company is to give up on the U.S. market, she said, but it will “definitely expand other avenues for sales,” such as in Australia or Europe.

In the eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou, a manufacturing hub, a holiday lights maker was less optimistic. Bo, who shared only his surname out of concern for retaliation, said he could “only give up” if the tariff hikes were here to stay because other markets might not work. 

“In the past few years, the European market has been in a slump,” Bo said. “So we had wanted to try and develop our business in the United States.”

In Hong Kong, Danny Lau, who runs an aluminum-coating factory in the nearby southern Chinese city of Dongguan, said one of his U.S clients would keep buying from him for an ongoing project but was unsure about the next project. Another client told Lau that the chances are slim to strike a deal when tariffs are so high. Lau has been exploring other markets, but he says it's not easy because some may find his high-quality products too expensive.

At a port in the Chinese city of Shanghai, ships heading to the U.S. had almost vanished by Thursday, the day after Trump's tariff on China took effect, according to a report by the financial news site Caixin. Major shipping lines were drastically cutting back on trans-Pacific routes, the report said.

For the longer term, the tariff war is likely to prompt Chinese businesses to diversify their supply chains and move part of their manufacturing capacity outside of China, and even to the United States, said Hu, the consultant.

Some might follow in the footsteps of the Tianjin steelmaking business, which gave up trading with the U.S. after both Trump and Biden raised tariffs on Chinese steel. “The best plan is to not come into contact,” said David Yu, who works in the company's foreign sales department.

However, not everyone is ready to give up on the U.S. market. Zou, the exporter in Ningbo, describes the U.S. market as “reliable and without finicky demands.”

“It's the best market on Earth,” he said. “I am waiting for the rainbow after the storm.”

MUSCAT, Oman (AP) — Iran and the United States will hold more negotiations next week over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, Iranian state television reported Saturday at the end of the first round of talks between the two countries since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.

Iran's state-run broadcaster revealed that U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi “briefly spoke” together — the first time the two nations have done that since the Obama administration. 

Tehran's declaration that the two sides spoke face-to-face — even if briefly — suggests the negotiations went well even to Iranian state TV, which long has been controlled by hard-liners. 

In a statement released Saturday afternoon, the White House described the discussions as “very positive and constructive,” while conceding the issues that need to be resolved “are very complicated.”

“Special Envoy Witkoff's direct communication today was a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial outcome,” the White House said.

Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday while flying to Miami for a UFC event that the talks are “going okay.”

“I can't tell you because nothing matters until you get it done so I don't like talking about it but it's going ok. The Iran situation is going pretty good, I think,” he said.

The next round of talks will take place Saturday, April 19, according to the Iranian and American statements.




This first round of talks began at around 3:30 p.m. local. The two sides spoke for over two hours at a location in the outskirts of Muscat, Oman's capital, ending the talks around 5:50 p.m. local time. The convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff returned to Muscat before disappearing into traffic around a neighborhood that is home to the U.S. Embassy.

The stakes of the negotiations couldn't be higher for the two nations closing in on half a century of enmity. Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.

Associated Press journalists saw a convoy believed to be carrying Witkoff leave the Omani Foreign Ministry on Saturday afternoon and then speed off into the outskirts of Muscat. The convoy went into a compound and a few minutes later, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote on the social platform X that the “indirect talks” had begun. 

Afterward, Araghchi described the meeting as constructive to Iranian state TV, with four rounds of messages exchanged during the indirect portion.

“Neither we nor the other side are interested in fruitless negotiations — so-called ‘talks for the sake of talks,' wasting time, or drawn-out, exhausting negotiations,” he said. “Both sides, including the Americans, have said that their goal is also to reach an agreement in the shortest possible time. However, that will certainly not be an easy task.”

That the two men spoke face-to-face satisfied a demand of the Americans. Trump and Witkoff both had described the talks as being “direct.” 

“I think our position begins with dismantlement of your program. That is our position today,” Witkoff told The Wall Street Journal before his trip. “That doesn't mean, by the way, that at the margin we're not going to find other ways to find compromise between the two countries.”

He added: “Where our red line will be, there can't be weaponization of your nuclear capability.”

Araghchi, however, sought to downplay the encounter as “a brief initial conversation, greetings and polite exchanges” — likely to avoid drawing the anger of hard-liners in Iran.

Badr al-Busaidi, Oman's foreign minister who shuttled between the two sides, said the countries have a “shared aim of concluding a fair and binding agreement.”

“I would like to thank my two colleagues for this engagement, which took place in a friendly atmosphere conducive to bridging viewpoints and ultimately achieving regional and global peace, security and stability,” al-Busaidi wrote on X. “We will continue to work together and put further efforts to assist in arriving at this goal.”

While the U.S. side can offer sanctions relief for Iran's beleaguered economy, it remains unclear just how much Iran will be willing to concede. Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran could only maintain a small stockpile of uranium enriched to 3.67%. Today, Tehran's stockpile could allow it to build multiple nuclear weapons if it so chooses and it has some material enriched up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Judging from negotiations since Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, Iran will likely ask to keep enriching uranium up to at least 20%.

One thing it won't do is give up its program entirely. That makes the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of a so-called Libyan solution — “you go in, blow up the facilities, dismantle all the equipment, under American supervision, American execution” — unworkable.

Iranians including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have held up what ultimately happened to the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed with his own gun by rebels in the country's 2011 Arab Spring uprising, as a warning about what can happen when you trust the United States.

Six people were killed when a sightseeing helicopter broke apart and crashed into the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey. Pieces of the aircraft could be seen floating in the river Friday as divers resumed searching for clues as to the cause of Thursday's crash.

NEW YORK (AP) — A New York City sightseeing helicopter broke apart and crashed into the Hudson River near the New Jersey shoreline, killing the pilot and a Spanish family of five who were on board.

Pieces of the aircraft could be seen floating in the river on Friday as divers searched for clues about what caused the Thursday crash. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. It's the latest in a series of recent aircraft crashes and close calls that have left some people worried about the safety of flying in the U.S.

Here's what we know so far:

Witnesses described seeing the helicopter's tail and main rotor breaking away and smoke pouring from the spinning chopper before it slammed into the water.

The helicopter took off from a downtown heliport at around 3 p.m. and flew north along the Manhattan skyline before heading south toward the Statue of Liberty. Less than 18 minutes into the flight, parts of the aircraft were seen tumbling into the water.

Rescue boats circled the submerged aircraft within minutes of impact, and recovery crews hoisted the mangled helicopter out of the water just after 8 p.m. using a floating crane.

The bodies were also recovered from the river, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said.




The victims included passengers Agustin Escobar, 49, his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal, 39, and their three children, Victor, 4, Mercedes, 8, and Agustin, 10. Mercedes would have turned 9 on Friday, officials said.

Escobar, an executive at Siemens, was in the New York area on business, and his family flew in to meet him for a few days, Steven Fulop, mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey, wrote in a post on X. Photos on the helicopter company's website show the couple and their children smiling just before taking off.

In a statement posted on the social platform X on Friday night by Joan Camprubí Montal, Montal's brother, family members said there were “no words to describe” what they are experiencing.

“These are very difficult times, but optimism and joy have always characterized our family. We want to keep the memory of a happy and united family, in the sweetest moment of their lives,” he said. “They have departed together, leaving an indelible mark among all their relatives, friends, and acquaintances.”

The pilot was Seankese Johnson, 36, a U.S. Navy veteran who received his commercial pilot's license in 2023. He had logged about 800 hours of flight time as of March, Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters Friday.

In the summer of 2023, Johnson announced on Facebook that he was flying a helicopter to fight fires for a Montana-based firm. In March this year, he changed his profile to an image of him piloting a helicopter with a view of One World Trade Center and the Manhattan skyline in the background. 

His father, Louis Johnson, told The New York Times his son had moved to New York this year for “a new chapter in his life.”

On Saturday the NTSB said divers were still working to recover wreckage and investigators were evaluating the aircraft's flight control system. 

Its main fuselage and other parts were recovered, but authorities were using sonar to try to identify the remaining pieces. 

The helicopter was not equipped with flight recorders, and no onboard video recorders had been recovered, NTSB said.

Hemendy said the NTSB would not speculate on the cause of the crash so early in the investigation.

The main and rear rotors of the helicopter, along with its transmission, roof and tail structures had still not been found as of Friday, she said.

“We are very factual, and we will provide that in due course,” she said.

Justin Green, an aviation lawyer and former Marine Corps helicopter pilot, said videos of the crash suggest that a “catastrophic mechanical failure” left the pilot with no chance to save the aircraft. It is possible the helicopter's main rotors struck the tail boom, breaking it apart and causing the cabin to free fall, Green said.

Michael Roth, who owns the helicopter company, New York Helicopter, told The New York Post that he doesn't know what went wrong with the aircraft.

“The only thing I know by watching a video of the helicopter falling down, that the main rotor blades weren't on the helicopter,” he said, noting that he had never seen such a thing happen in his 30 years in the business, but that, “These are machines, and they break.”

In the last eight years, the New York Helicopter has been through a bankruptcy and faces ongoing lawsuits over alleged debts. Phones rang unanswered at the company's offices Friday.

In 2013, one of the company's helicopters suddenly lost power in midair, and the pilot maneuvered it to a safe landing on pontoons in the Hudson. 

FAA data shows the helicopter that crashed Thursday was built in 2004. According to FAA records, the helicopter had a maintenance issue last September involving its transmission assembly. The helicopter had logged 12,728 total flight hours at the time, according to the records.

At least 38 people have died in helicopter crashes in New York City since 1977. A collision between a plane and a tourist helicopter over the Hudson in 2009 killed nine people, and five people died in 2018 when a charter helicopter offering “open door” flights went down into the East River.

Thursday's crash was the first for a helicopter in the city since one hit the roof of a skyscraper in 2019, killing the pilot.

Recently, seven people were killed when a medical transport plane plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood. The crash in January happened two days after an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter collided in midair in Washington in the deadliest U.S. air disaster in a generation. 

On Friday, three people were killed when a small plane crashed in South Florida near a major highway.

Democratic candidate for Oakland mayor laid out his plans to tackle homelessness, crime and the city's massive budget deficit in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital ahead of the special election against former California Rep. Barbara Lee.

EXCLUSIVE: Former Oakland City Council member Loren Taylor said former Rep. Barbara Lee's ties to the political establishment could help him to win over Oaklanders who are ""fed up"" with the status quo ahead of the April 15 special election.

A self-described political outsider who only served one term as a city council member after unseating a 16-year incumbent, Taylor shared his plans to bring change to the ""struggling"" Bay Area city in an interview with Fox News Digital. 

""I am running as a political outsider who has just enough experience inside of City Hall to understand what's going on, but not so much that I'm entrenched in the political establishment. That is what Oaklanders are looking for,"" Taylor said. 

While Lee – a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and 2024 Senate primary candidate – has name recognition and national experience, Taylor has made waves in Oakland's special election as campaign finance reports reveal he has outraised the career California politician.

Former Oakland City Council member Loren Taylor, left, and former Rep. Barbara Lee, right, will face off on April 15 for Oakland's special election. 

""We have raised more money than other candidates in this race from local residents,"" Taylor said. ""Over 80% of our contributions come directly from people who live right here in Oakland, compared to less than 50% for my primary component. That speaks volumes about who this campaign is. We are powered by Oaklanders, locals who are impacted by the decisions that are being made. The campaign is surging. Huge momentum these final days fueled by that overwhelming grassroots support.""

DEM MAYOR UNLEASHES TASK FORCE IN ATTEMPT TO RESCUE CRIME-RIDDEN CITY: 'RESTORE ORDER TO OUR STREETS'

Oakland's staggering $129.8 budget deficit for Fiscal Year 2024-25 forced some Oakland firehouses to close their doors earlier this year. The City Council passed a resolution to reopen those firehouses, preventing tragedy from financial mismanagement. 

The liberal-run city has had four different mayors in a four-month period after former Mayor Sheng Thao was recalled this November and subsequently indicted on eight counts of bribery. Oakland has been without a clear leader this year as the city continues to grapple with a homelessness crisis. 

Alameda County Health's January 2024 Point-in-Time (PIT) report found there were 5,490 homeless individuals in Oakland in 2024, a 9% increase since 2022. 

""Oaklanders are frustrated,"" Taylor explained. ""We are upset that we have not been getting what we deserve, what we should be getting from our local government. The status quo continues to fail us when we see crime rates rising out of control, we see homelessness still growing when it's shrinking in neighboring cities, we see our city facing the largest fiscal budget deficit in our history – a number of failures that show that what we have is not working.""

While the Oakland Police Department reported a decrease in violent crime in 2024, 2025 began with a crime surge plagued by five recorded homicides within a 48-hour period. By Jan. 3, The San Francisco Chronicle reported Oakland's third homicide of the year and seventh since Dec. 30, 2024. 

Taylor has called for equipping more police officers on the ground with technology to prevent violence and lawlessness. 

""We are struggling as a city, and that is what this campaign is speaking to. I am ready to make the hard and necessary decisions in order to fix the mismanagement, in order to address the corruption head on, restore trust in City Hall, make sure that we're delivering as Oaklanders want,"" he said.

Just across the Bay, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has hit the ground running since assuming office in January. He launched the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Hospitality Task Force and passed the Fentanyl State of Emergency Ordinance as he works to clean up San Francisco's streets and restore what he describes as commonsense policies to the city. 

""I'm absolutely watching what's going on in San Francisco right across the Bay and even in the South Bay, in San Jose, with Mayor Matt Mahan, whom I am proud to have his endorsement,"" Taylor said. ""I think both of those mayors are political outsiders, just like me. They didn't grow up within the ranks of government. They had careers, were making a significant impact outside and saw the gaps that existed with local government. I think that we share a bond in that in terms of bringing a data, results-driven approach to moving things forward.""

Lt. General John Caine faces questioning by Democratic senators during his confirmation hearing about the Signal war chat leak.

""Our standards will be high, uncompromising and clear."" --Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's Message to the Force, January 25, 2025

President Donald Trump's pick for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired Lt. Gen. Dan Caine (retired), possesses an extraordinary record of service—in Iraq, in special access programs and in the National Guard. There is no question of his capacity to lead, devotion to our country, character, courage or competence.

But those aren't the qualifications required by law to be the senior-most military officer in our Armed Forces. Federal law requires the chairman to be active duty and have served in any of three senior roles: vice chairman, service chief (except the Coast Guard) or commander of a combatant command. Caine fails to meet one of these. 

The president can waive most of the qualifications if he determines it is in our ""national interest."" But the only justification that President Trump has stated for waiving these legal standards in this instance is that he remembers Caine stating he ""loved"" Trump, would ""kill"" for Trump and that Caine proudly donned a MAGA hat which—as Trump gushed—would be a violation of federal law.

GENERAL WHO HELPED TRUMP DECIMATE ISIS TERRORISTS IN FIRST TERM CONFIRMED AS JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN

Strangely, Caine has categorically denied that he ever did any of those things, which means either Caine lied—under oath—or that he told the truth and Trump has no justification.

To President Trump, the ""national interest"" appears to mean personal loyalty.

The nomination of Caine is just the latest example in a dangerous pattern of President Trump purging—in multiple reckless and sudden bursts—the military of its highest-performing general officers from mission-critical roles. Why? Because they promised loyalty to the Constitution instead of to him? These firings have nothing to do with upholding high standards at all—they are about prioritizing fealty over qualifications and putting our national security at risk in the process.

The only reason this chairmanship vacancy exists in the first place is because President Trump unceremoniously fired, without cause, Gen. CQ Brown Jr., who was serving—and excelling—in the role.

Gen. Brown didn't just meet the legal qualifications to be chairman—he embodied them. He brought his 40 years of honorable service in the Air Force to overseeing U.S. military operations in at least six active war zones and advised the defense secretary on responses to three tense international crises. Prior to being chairman, Gen. Brown served as chief of staff of the Air Force, commanded Pacific Air Forces and flew more than 3,100 hours with over 130 in combat.

By firing such an exemplary officer and replacing him with someone who President Trump—rightly or wrongly—believes declared fealty to him, our commander-in-chief is sending a dangerous message to the force that loyalty, not expertise or even a commitment to upholding the law, will be rewarded.

The disgraceful treatment of Gen. Brown was not an isolated incident.

President Trump has fired at least 10 expert senior military officers, most of whom were women or people of color, and several of whom—unlike Caine—met the legal qualifications to be chairman.

These were warriors at the top of their game: Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the Navy's first woman to serve as chief of naval operations, who had more than two decades of experience that included commanding carrier strike groups and destroyers. Adm. Linda Fagan, the first female Coast Guard commandant, who led on all seven continents. Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short, a command pilot who completed more than 1,800 flight hours during her 30-year career. Lt. Gen. Telita Crosland, who was pushed out from the Defense Health Agency after her 32-year career, which included serving as the deputy for all medical operations.

And just this month, Trump fired Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, who had a storied 36-year career, including serving as the first female president of the Naval War College, as well as Gen. Tim Haugh, the high-performing commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency.

These were all extraordinarily qualified military leaders summarily fired, with Trump choosing to replace them by nominating deeply unqualified appointees—while at the same time shouting that he only hires the ""best, most qualified"" people.

Trump's hiring decisions make a mockery of meritocracy, disrespect our service members' sacrifices and do nothing to strengthen our force or our national security. Even five previous secretaries of defense agreed that ""none of this is about warfighting.""

Installing loyalists at the top of the military is the kind of thing autocrats do when they are trying to seize control of government. Trump is aiming to ingrain a culture of fear that makes it harder for our service members to speak truth to power and uphold their oath to support and defend the Constitution.

What we saw happen with the nomination of Caine is not an aberration. It is part of a deliberate purge of expertise from our military that is eroding the very institution the American people rely on to keep them safe. My Republican colleagues need to stop enabling Trump's dictatorial tendencies and start doing more to protect the service members who've sacrificed so much for the rest of us.

Your phone's GPS isn't just for directions

Every time you check the weather, tag your location on Instagram or ask Google Maps for the quickest route, you're sharing your whereabouts. That's thanks to Location Tracking, a feature built into most apps and devices that uses GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cell towers to pinpoint your location.

Here's the catch: Many apps track you even when you're not using them. Some use this data to serve local content or ads, while others collect and sell it to third parties.

How to protect yourself:

Knowing when and how you're being tracked is the first step to stopping it.

More: Top 20 apps tracking you every day

What your apps know about you (and maybe shouldn't)

Before you can use that new photo editor or budgeting tool, it probably asked for a few things — access to your camera, contacts, microphone, maybe even your calendar. These are called App Permissions, and they determine what parts of your phone an app can interact with.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

While some requests are necessary (e.g., a video app needs camera access), others can be excessive or even suspicious. For example, why does a flashlight app need your location or call logs?

Tips for staying in control:

Your data shouldn't be the price of convenience. Set boundaries.

TOP 20 APPS TRACKING YOU EVERY DAY

A second lock on your digital front door

Passwords aren't perfect. That's where two-factor authentication (2FA) comes in. It adds an extra layer of protection by requiring two forms of identification before granting access to your account, typically something you know (a password) and something you have (a text code or authentication app).

Many major apps and platforms now support 2FA, and enabling it can help block hackers, even if they steal your password.

Activate 2FA where you can. It's one of the simplest ways to level up your mobile security.

The invisible label that tracks your habits

Behind the scenes, your phone is assigned a unique string of numbers and letters called a mobile advertising identifier (Mobile Ad ID). It helps advertisers track your behavior across apps and websites to build a profile of your interests.

While it doesn't include your name, it can be linked to your device and used to serve targeted ads. Think of it as a digital name tag for marketing purposes.

10 SIMPLE STEPS TO IMPROVE YOUR SMARTPHONE'S SECURITY AND PRIVACY

Your personal privacy tunnel

A VPN is like a secret tunnel for your internet connection. It hides your online activities and helps keep your personal information safe when you're using the internet, especially on public Wi-Fi.

In addition to protecting your information from prying eyes, a VPN also hides your real location. It allows you to connect to the internet through a server in another part of the world, which makes it appear as though you're browsing from a different location. This is useful for security (protecting your privacy) and for accessing content that might be restricted in certain areas.

When you connect to public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport, your data can be exposed to hackers and snoops. That's where a VPN (virtual private network) comes in. It encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a secure server, hiding your IP address and protecting your activity.

Think of it as a private tunnel for your internet usage, shielding your data from prying eyes.

What VPNs are great for:

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on the Pentagon releasing details on UFO sightings on ‘Special Report.'

A declassified document posted to the CIA's website is raising eyebrows with claims of an alleged UFO attack on Soviet forces. 

The viral report summarizes an article published by Canadian Weekly World News and the Ukrainian paper Holos Ukrayiny and was initially released to the public in May 2000. 

The firsthand report describes a retaliatory alien attack after Soviet soldiers reportedly shot down a UFO flying over a military base. 

The aliens reportedly emerged from the wreckage, fusing together into one object and bursting into a bright light and turning all but two of the soldiers to stone.

""If the KGB file corresponds to reality, this is an extremely menacing case,"" an unnamed CIA representative was quoted as saying in the report. ""The aliens possess such weapons and technology that go beyond all our assumptions. They can stand up for themselves if attacked."" 

Canadian Weekly World News estimates the supposed incident occurred between 1989 and 1990 and was initially published in 1993. 

According to the document, information acquired by U.S. intelligence revealed reports of a ""low-flying spaceship in the shape of a saucer"" over a Soviet unit participating in training exercises.

Officials wrote that ""for unknown reasons"" the soldiers launched a surface-to-air missile at the unknown aircraft, causing it to crash near the military base. 

The report describes how ""five short humanoids with ‘large heads and large black eyes' emerged"" from the downed spaceship and fused together to create one ""single object"" while emitting a loud buzzing noise. 

The spherical object reportedly then burst into a blinding bright light. 

Eyewitness testimonials claim 23 soldiers suddenly ""turned into stone poles."" Two men reportedly survived the encounter because they were standing in a shaded area and were not completely exposed to the blast of light.

Officials wrote that the remains of the ""petrified soldiers"" and the spaceship were transported to a secret scientific research base near Moscow, where it was discovered the soldiers' molecular structure matched that of limestone. The document claims scientists believe the cause was a ""source of energy"" not yet known to humans. 

The CIA did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

While the initial context of the document remains unknown, it likely originated from a telegram or another form of open-source information.

However, former CIA agent Mike Baker is skeptical of the extraordinary claims detailed in the report. 

""If there was an incident, regardless of the nature of the incident, I suspect that the actual report doesn't look much like what has now come out from five or six or seven iterations of what originally was [written],"" Baker told Fox News Digital. 

In 2020, the Department of Defense announced the creation of an Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) with the goal to ""detect, analyze and catalog"" unknown objects that could pose a threat to national security.

The document, published on the CIA's website, details how Soviet soldiers shot down an alleged alien spacecraft. (iStock)

The creation of the program comes after years of government efforts to investigate questionable aircraft. While UFOs are typically associated with aliens, Baker insists officials are required to look into unidentified objects in the interest of national security. 

""The Pentagon was saying if aviators are flying, and they identify something that they can't readily say what this is, then [officials] should, as a matter of national security, make sure that they catalog it and figure out what it was,"" Baker told Fox News Digital. ""There's a reason why you have a method of investigating these things. It doesn't mean you're investigating alien spacecraft, but that's where people's minds go when they hear about these sorts of things."" 

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

UFO EXPERT SAYS TRUMP'S DECLASSIFICATION COULD EXPOSE POSSIBLE ‘COVER-UP' SPANNING DECADES

Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed an order to declassify decades-old government files pertaining to UFOs, possibly revealing federal secrets while pulling back the curtain on any potential ""cover-up."" 

""A lot of people believe that there is a smoking gun somewhere in the files,"" former U.K. Defense Ministry official and UFO expert Nick Pope told Fox News Digital. ""It is a very widely held belief that elements in the U.S. intelligence community know that some of this is extraterrestrial and have documents and files relating to this. And that, of course, is what everyone really wants to know. That's the $64,000 question.""

As for the extraordinary claims of a Soviet-era alien invasion and retaliatory attack, Baker does not buy it. 

""I'm sure there's something out there,"" Baker said. ""I just don't think that they landed decades ago, turned Soviet soldiers into limestone and we're just now hearing about it. I don't think that's the case.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","What baby boomers learned from weathering the Great Recession — and what they regret","https://www.businessinsider.com/baby-boomers-great-recession-retirement-investment-lessons-2025-4","Sun, 13 Apr 2025 08:49:00 GMT","

Lynn Benning, 67, said every financial downturn has hit her differently.

During the stagflation of 1980, she was in her 20s, single, and stressed out about affording rent on an entry-level income.

Amid the 2008 Great Recession, she was married and in her 40s. She and her husband rethought their assets and retirement prep. They'd just bought a house, couldn't afford furniture for it, and ended up selling it later at a loss.

In today's uncertain economy, she's forgoing major purchases and focusing on building savings. Having cash on hand and avoiding credit card debt helped her reestablish financial stability in the past, she said.

""Sometimes you're going to have bad luck,"" Benning said. ""We just sucked it up and started over again.""

It's some much-needed perspective after the stock market's hectic week driven by the twists and turns of President Donald Trump's trade war. Billionaires, CEOs, and Wall Street have signaled they're bracing for an economic downturn. Recession jitters have Americans of all ages saying they're holding off on big purchases, delaying family and job plans, and feeling the emotional weight of economic uncertainty.

With policy whiplash from the White House, BI spoke with three baby boomers about their experiences with past recessions, particularly the Great Recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis: how downturns shaped their finances, major life decisions, and how they approach setbacks. They told us what they learned — and what mistakes young people should avoid.

When the housing market crashed in 2008, Nancy Neff was in her mid-50s. She had most of her investments in her 401(k), and though she was losing money in the stock market, she didn't touch her retirement account.

Now, the 72-year-old Connecticut resident's investments have weathered two major economic downturns, but she still managed to retire comfortably with a nest egg of over $1 million after a long career in academia and software engineering. She said she receives a few thousand dollars in monthly Social Security but doesn't have to rely on it to pay bills.

""I put money in a diversified mutual fund and ignored it. I didn't play with it, and I didn't try to time the market,"" she said, adding, ""I'm in pretty good shape.""

For retirees — and hopeful retirees — the peaks and valleys of the stock market have caused financial anxiety. Some Americans told BI that they lost tens of thousands of dollars from their 401(k)s in recent months, and others said they are rethinking their plans to leave the workforce.

Still, older Americans BI spoke with cautioned against making rash investment decisions. In the long run, it's best to leave investments as is and ride out any market volatility, they said. BI has heard this advice from financial advisors, too. Per IG Wealth Management, it took the S&P 500 about six years to fully rebound from the 2008 crash, but other downturns have been resolved quicker.

If you can afford to leave your 401(k) alone, Neff said it's the wisest thing to do.

""Have six months at least of savings so that if something happens, you're not cashing in your 401(k),"" she said. ""Whether that's something happening to you personally or something happening to the larger economy, have a cushion.""

Beyond having a cool and calm stock strategy, boomers told BI it's important to have cash savings in case of a recession. Having an emergency fund can offer peace of mind in case of job losses, unexpected expenses, or high consumer prices.

It may be tough advice for people who feel like they're living paycheck to paycheck, but boomers said if there is ever a time in life to try to cut back and save, it's ahead of a possible recession.

Gail Lisenbard, 65, is doing her best to build savings. She's a philosophy lecturer at the University of Colorado Boulder but teaches remotely from Naples, Florida. The 65-year-old and her partner have paid off their mortgage, but they're trying to cut costs due to recession fears.

Lisenbard's mindful spending strategy began after she lost her job in the 2008 recession. Since then, she has struggled to find a job that offers a high 401(k) match and has learned how to save as much money as possible on her lecturer income.

She said she paid off her car, which used to cost her $200 a month, and has saved an additional $300 by cutting back on dining out and entertainment. Lisenbard also tries to save money by grooming her mini golden doodle, Abby, by herself.

""I'm saving by making some really serious decisions about what I can do, what I can't do,"" she said, adding that she hopes to retire this fall.

Some of the baby boomers BI spoke with expressed regrets about navigating past recessions. Benning said she wished she hadn't bought a house before the 2008 market crash, and Lisenbard wished she had built a bigger nest egg when she had a job with strong benefits.

At the same time, all said their takeaways from past recessions taught them how to better navigate the stock market, savings, and major life decisions in periods of uncertainty. They hope the wisdom they've gained over time will help them recover faster from future downturns.

A couple of months ago, as federal policy was beginning to change under Trump, Neff said she added more money to her emergency fund so that she could ride out economic changes. She's done the same in other times of unpredictability, and she said getting a bank account with compound interest allows her to build up her savings quicker.

She now spends her retirement traveling the world. A decade ago, just after she stopped work, she said she boarded a cruise to Europe and still chooses cheap lodging and transportation wherever she goes —because you never know what the future holds. When BI spoke with her this week, she was taking lace-making classes in Belgium.

""Live well within your means when times are good so that when times are bad, you still have a cushion,"" she said. ""And I have always had enough of a cushion.""

The giants of private equity have spent years trying to cozy up to Middle Eastern wealth funds to secure massive checks. US President Donald Trump's burgeoning trade war just made those efforts even more critical — and asset managers have been forced to get creative.

Carlyle Group Inc., for instance, is sending more than half a dozen of its top executives to Abu Dhabi this week to offer training to their counterparts at the emirate's many sovereign wealth funds. BlackRock Inc. is starting up a program to hire more young Saudis and is relocating a bevy of senior investment professionals to the kingdom to help with the effort. Others have been organizing dinners and events to honor Eid al-Fitr.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Ecuador's voters face a stark choice on Sunday as an ally of Donald Trump fights to stay in power against a socialist who wants to overhaul the nation's economic model.

In the February first round, fewer than 17,000 votes separated President Daniel Noboa from opposition leader Luisa González. Neck-and-neck polling ahead of the 10-day quiet period suggests another tight vote, potentially indicating a longer-than-usual wait before a winner is officially declared.

Apple Inc. assembled $22 billion worth of iPhones in India in the 12 months ended March, increasing production by nearly 60% over the previous year in a sign of continued diversification away from China.

The Cupertino, California-headquartered company now makes 20%, or one in five, of its prized iPhones in the South Asian country, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified as the information isn't public.

China's Commerce Ministry called the U.S. tariff exemptions a ""small step"" and urged U.S. President Donald Trump to ""completely abolish"" the reciprocal tariffs, which include a 145% duty on imports from China.

""We urge the U.S. to heed the rational voices of the international community and domestic parties, take a big stride in correcting its mistakes, completely abolish the wrongful action of 'reciprocal tariffs,' and return to the correct path of resolving differences through equal dialogue based on mutual respect,"" the ministry said in an online statement, according to a CNBC translation.

The ministry also said China is ""evaluating the relevant impact"" of the tariff exemptions on some tech products announced late Friday.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Sunday that ""right now,"" there are not any plans for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to speak.

""This issue is truly at the leaders level,"" he said on CBS News' Face the Nation.

The response in China to U.S. tariffs can be seen in both state media and social media. The recent exemptions are being presented domestically as Trump is backing down and further evidence that Chinese supply chains are not easily replaceable by U.S. companies.

""Public opinion widely views this as another retreat by the U.S. government on its tariff policies,"" the official Beijing Daily wrote.

On China's popular social media platform Weibo, the hashtag ""Trump administration retreats again"" ranked No. 2 on the hot search list.

The Trump administration late Friday exempted some widely used tech devices and components, including smartphones, computers, semiconductors, solar cells and flash drives, from reciprocal tariffs, according to guidance from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The move was viewed as a major win for tech giants, including Apple, which manufacture many products in China. But the long-lasting effects on the U.S. economy and small businesses from the China tariffs may be irreversible, CNBC previously reported.

A 20% tariff on all Chinese products still remains in effect, despite the tariff exemption announcement.

When the stock market is in the middle of a panic, investors flee to bonds. Last week, that fundamental ""flight to safety"" approach didn't work. A surge in U.S. treasury bond yields sparked questions about the fundamental role of bonds in a diversified portfolio, and even bigger questions about whether an unprecedented shift away from the U.S. treasuries market and U.S. dollar could be underway.  

Managing bond maturities had already become increasingly difficult for investors in a world of rapid interest rate swings and inflation as the Fed transitioned from an era of ultra-low interest rates to major rate hikes to fight inflation. Many have opted to only invest in ultrashort treasury bond funds to avoid the risk. But there's another concept used by financial advisors and wealth planning firms for decades that investing experts say can work for investors seeking shelter in the market storm that has hit both stocks and bonds as a result of President Trump's trade war: the bond ladder.

Experts say that in today's volatile atmosphere, this concept has the potential to offer exposure to treasury bonds without having to worry about massive short-term swings in prices and yields. The goal of a bond ladder is to invest in a wide range of treasury maturities, hold them all to maturity, and provide regular income, in the form of principal and interest, on a monthly basis. 

Many financial advisors and wealth management firms continue to offer this strategy on a custom basis, but it is a lot of work and often reserved for high net worth clients. 

The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) brings the same approach into an ETF at a reasonable cost (an expense ratio of 0.25%, or 25 basis points), investing in treasuries, from 30-day issues to 10-year bonds, and has a fixed monthly income distributing roughly 11% to investors, through 2035. In a sense, for investors familiar with the target-date fund approach that is timed to invest in a manner that meets the life needs of an investor as they age, and who also understand the concept of annuities, this bond ladder ETF brings similar approaches to fixed-income personal finance. It provides monthly income with a decades-long horizon.

""When you buy a bond you know exactly what you're going to get,"" Nate Conrad, head of the LifeX mutual fund franchise at Stone Ridge Asset Management, said on CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" last Wednesday. ""When you create a bond ladder, you don't care about these changes that we're seeing in bond prices because you're going to get what you're going to get,"" he said.

Independent ETF expert Dave Nadig says the bond ladder strategy is a safe bet in an agitated bond market because even as treasury prices and yields swing, it should not matter to the investor holding this kind of fund for regular income needs.

""You need to understand that when things happen like what's going on in the market right now where we have the bond market selloff, the net asset value of these is going to come down and that's going to be a shocker,"" Nadig said. ""That's completely normal and you should not care because the point of this is holding it to completion, holding it to maturity. ... They are, to be blunt, very boring in construction, and I'm a big fan of boring when it's delivering an actual pattern of returns that investors need.""

""When you create a ladder, you don't care about the prices,"" Conrad said. What you do care about, he said:  ""Peace of mind in a really tough time.""

Most investors have opted for another approach to dealing with the recent bond market stress, leaning on ultrashort fixed-income bond ETFs. Mike Akins, founding partner at ETF Action, says ultrashort ETFs have become akin to money market funds for some investors. 

""Ultrashort is far and away where you're getting most of the money,"" Akins said, with the recent data showing over 90% of bond ETF flows into the ultrashort category, which includes the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL).

But Nadig says the bond ladder can serve a broader goal. ""It's really about protecting the buying power here,"" he said. ""This is about immunization from liabilities,"" he added. For any investor worried about mortgages, second properties, and college payments, ""you take that cash flow and put it out of mind. It's a psychological tool. It's much easier to let it ride when you know how it will play out,"" he said.

Of course, no strategy is entirely without risk. In a world of hyper-inflation, there is no way to guarantee any investment can preserve buying power. And after a week during which investors seemed to question whether the U.S. bond market would continue to serve in its long-time role as the surest investment in the world, there is no ruling out the unthinkable, even if it does remain an unlikely outcome.

A U.S. treasury default is the only other reason to worry about a bond ladder strategy. 

""God willing, we're in that world where you're never going to see that,"" Nadig said.

Russia and Ukraine's top diplomats on Saturday used a high-level conference in Turkey to once again trade accusations of violating a tentative U.S.-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges of negotiating an end to the 3-year-old war.

The two foreign ministers spoke at separate events at the annual Antalya Diplomacy Forum, a day after U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss peace prospects. Ukraine's European allies on Friday promised billions of dollars to help Kyiv keep fighting Russia's invasion.

While Moscow and Kyiv both agreed in principle last month to implement a limited, 30-day ceasefire, they issued conflicting statements soon after their separate talks with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia. They differed on the start time of halting strikes, and alleged near-immediate breaches by the other side.

""The Ukrainians have been attacking us from the very beginning, every passing day, maybe with two or three exceptions,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, adding that Moscow would provide the U.S., Turkey and international bodies with a list of Kyiv's attacks during the past three weeks.

A representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry separately told state media Saturday that Moscow has been sharing intelligence with the U.S. regarding more than 60 supposed breaches of the deal by Kyiv.

Lavrov on Saturday insisted Russia had stuck to the terms of the deal.

His Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, fiercely contested that claim, saying Russia had launched ""almost 70 missiles, over 2,200 (exploding) drones, and over 6,000 guided aerial bombs at Ukraine, mostly at civilians,"" since agreeing to the limited pause on strikes.

""This clearly shows to the world who wants peace and who wants war,"" he said.

Russian forces hold the advantage in Ukraine, and Kyiv has warned Moscow is planning a fresh spring offensive to ramp up pressure on its foe and improve its negotiating position.

Ukraine has endorsed a broader U.S. ceasefire proposal, but Russia has effectively blocked it by imposing far-reaching conditions. European governments have accused Putin of dragging his feet.

""Russia has to get moving"" on the road to ending the war, U.S. President Donald Trump posted on social media Friday. He said the war is ""terrible and senseless.""

Lavrov on Saturday reiterated that a prospective U.S.-backed agreement, also discussed in Saudi Arabia, to ensure safe navigation for commercial vessels in the Black Sea could not be implemented until restrictions are lifted on Russian access to shipping insurance, docking ports and international payment systems.

Details of the prospective deal were not released, but it appeared to mark another attempt to ensure safe Black Sea shipping after a 2022 agreement that was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey but halted by Russia the following year.

Ukraine's air force said a second F-16 fighter jet supplied by Western allies has been lost and its pilot, 26-year-old Pavlo Ivanov, killed.

Ukraine's General Staff said the F-16 crashed while repelling a Russian missile strike. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday offered condolences to Ivanov's family, saying, ""We are proud of our soldiers. We will give a strong and apt response.""

Ukraine said the first F-16 was shot down last August, after it intercepted three Russian missiles and a drone.

Since last July, Ukraine has received multiple batches of the fighter jets from Denmark and the Netherlands, with U.S. approval. Their total number has not been disclosed.

Meanwhile, Russian drones killed at least two civilians in Ukraine's southern Kherson region on Saturday, according to local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin.

TOKYO, April 13 (Reuters) - Japan must strengthen the yen, such as by helping boost the country's industrial competitiveness, as the currency's weakness has pushed up households' living costs, the ruling party's policy chief said on Sunday.

Ahead of trade talks with the U.S., Itsunori Onodera, chair of the Liberal Democratic Party's Policy Research Council, also said Japan should not intentionally sell its U.S. Treasury holdings, the largest outside the United States, in retaliation against tariffs levied by President Donald Trump.

""As a U.S. ally, the government shouldn't think about intentionally using U.S. Treasury holdings,"" Onodera told a programme on public broadcaster NHK, rejecting an opposition lawmaker's suggestion that Tokyo use its huge holdings of U.S. government debt as a negotiating tool in bilateral trade talks.

By blaming the weak yen for accelerating inflation, Onodera could be signalling that Japanese policymakers consider the yen's downtrend, rather than its recent rebound, as the bigger problem for the economy.

""The weak yen has been among factors pushing up prices,"" Onodera said. ""To strengthen the yen, it's important to strengthen Japanese companies."" 

The bilateral trade negotiations this week will likely include the thorny topic of currency policy, with some officials privately bracing for Washington to call on Tokyo to prop up the yen.

The slow pace at which the Bank of Japan is raising interest rates from ultra-low levels could also come under fire, sources have told Reuters.

Tokyo's top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa, the minister for economic revitalisation, will meet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday, two people familiar with the negotiations told Reuters.

Japan has historically sought to prevent its currency from rising too much, as a strong yen would hurt its export-reliant economy. But in recent years as the BOJ continued its ultra-loose monetary policy while the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates, the yen slid to nearly three-decade lows.

Tokyo intervened to buy the yen in 2022 and again last year, when the dollar had risen to nearly 160 yen. The Japanese currency has recently rallied in a broad-based sell-off of the dollar, which fell on Friday as low as 142.895 yen, its lowest since September.

The 10 trading days since Trump hit automakers with tariffs were the most convulsive since the pandemic panic of 2020, as prices of stocks, bonds, oil, gold and the dollar swung wildly.

Selling in Treasuries - the linchpin safe asset in global markets - was the heaviest for decades. A massive wave of selling that hit U.S. government debt in Asia on Wednesday stoked market speculation China was among those unloading its holdings.

The Treasury sell-off was among the factors that led Trump to announce a 90-day pause on his ""reciprocal"" tariff plan, with Bessent likely playing a key role.

Japan held $1.079 trillion in Treasuries in January, followed by China with $760.8 billion, according to Treasury Department data.

Billie Jean King has had a prolific career as a No. 1 tennis player in the world and fierce advocate for women's representation and equality in sports and beyond.

So it makes sense that people often ask her for her best advice for doing meaningful work that makes a positive impact.

King says the best career advice she has to offer is something she and her mentor, the late businessman Edgar Woolard, came up with together — she had once asked him for guidance on what to say during a college commencement speech she was giving.

They wanted to balance advice that helps people achieve outward success, like money and recognition, with inner success and what keeps people happy, King told CNBC Make It at an event in partnership with e.l.f. to recognize King becoming the first female athlete to receive a Hollywood Walk of Fame star for sports entertainment.

King and Woolard came up with three key elements to success:

""Those are the three things that I hope will help anybody at any age, but particularly young people,"" King says.

To King's point of continual learning, the 81-year-old recently re-enrolled in college to earn the history degree she started more than 60 years ago; King left college in 1964 to pursue her tennis career, but now she's back to hitting the books as part of California State University L.A.'s Class of 2026.

King says she'd been thinking about finishing her degree for many years and figured now was the time to finally do it.

""I love history,"" she says. ""The more you know about history, and the more you know about yourself. It's amazing.""

History-making game-changers, after all, inspire her to greatness. King considers Althea Gibson, who in 1950 became the first Black tennis player to compete in the U.S. National Championships and had a storied career, an early inspiration.

King continues to be inspired by women athletes paving the future of women's sports today, she says: ""I look at all of them and realize how hard they must have worked just to get where they are.""

President Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested Sunday that the reciprocal tariff exemptions for some electronics may be short-lived, and said separate tariffs for these products are ""coming soon.""

""They're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,"" Lutnick said on ABC News' ""This Week.""

""So this is not like a permanent sort of exemption. [Trump's] just clarifying that these are not available to be negotiated away by countries,"" he said.

Lutnick added: ""These are things that are national security that we need to be made in America.""

Lutnick's comments throw cold water on hopes that popular tech products made in China, such as computers, laptops, smartphones, and flat-panel TVs, would be spared from Trump's 145% reciprocal tariffs — duties that raise prices for U.S. importers and are generally passed on to consumers.

They also add more confusion about Trump's tariff policy, which has changed repeatedly. Democratic lawmakers on Sunday said the changes are causing ""chaos"" and a ""crisis of credibility"" for Trump.

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection late Friday evening announced exemptions for smartphones, computers, and other tech devices and components from Trump's reciprocal tariffs. A 20% tariff on all Chinese goods remains in effect.

Lutnick on Sunday emphasized that the U.S. ""can't be beholden and rely upon foreign countries for fundamental things that we need.""

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, in an attempt to clarify why the exemptions were made, said Sunday that they are ""not really an exception,"" even though the executive order Trump signed concerning the exemptions is titled in part ""Clarification of Exceptions.""

""What happened is, this type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime,"" Greer said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation.""

The reciprocal tariff exemptions initially had brought a sigh of relief for major tech companies, including Apple, which manufactures most of its products in China.

But Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said the confusion sowed by the Trump administration's reversal late Friday on reciprocal tariffs on some electronics from China — and his sudden call on Wednesday for a 90-day pause in enforcing new tariffs on other countries — is harmful to the U.S.

""President Trump now has a crisis in credibility,"" he said in an interview Sunday on NBC News' ""Meet the Press."" ""We're hearing from around the world. People just don't know if they can trust him.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., warned that the trade turmoil will deter businesses from investing in the U.S. ""Right now what we've got is chaos,"" she said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""Investors will not invest in the United States when Donald Trump is playing red light, green light with tariffs.""

Bitcoin is now trading above the $85,000 mark following an impressive rally that began on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China. The announcement injected a wave of optimism across financial markets, helping to ease investor fears and ignite fresh momentum in the crypto space. Since then, BTC has surged more than 15%, marking one of its strongest short-term recoveries in recent weeks.

Market sentiment has shifted quickly as buyers step back in, and Bitcoin's strength above key technical levels suggests growing confidence among traders. However, beneath the surface, there are signs that caution is warranted. According to new insights from CryptoQuant, this rally appears to be driven in large part by leverage. Analysts warn that a leverage-driven pump is underway, not just in Bitcoin, but also across major altcoins, which could introduce heightened volatility in the coming sessions.

While the recent bounce has revived bullish hopes, the reliance on leveraged positions could leave the market vulnerable to sharp reversals. Whether this momentum can be sustained or leads to another round of liquidations remains the key question in the days ahead.

Bitcoin is now facing a critical test as bulls attempt to reclaim the $90,000 level, a key threshold that could confirm a recovery rally and signal the end of the recent downtrend. After weeks of relentless selling pressure and macroeconomic uncertainty, Bitcoin has bounced strongly from sub-$75K levels, now trading just above $85K. Yet despite this impressive rebound, the broader market remains on edge.

Global tensions, particularly those surrounding US trade policy and the risk of a broader economic slowdown, continue to inject volatility into financial markets. Bitcoin, often seen as a high-risk asset, remains 22% down from its all-time highs as it attempts to rebuild momentum. While bulls are showing signs of strength, concerns are mounting that the recent surge may not be entirely organic.

Top analyst Maartunn shared on X that this latest move appears to be a leverage-driven pump. His data shows a significant uptick in Bitcoin's Open Interest alongside the price surge — a signal that leveraged positions are fueling the rally. According to Maartun, this behavior is not isolated to Bitcoin. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are also showing similar leverage-driven characteristics.

This trend introduces the risk of sharp corrections if positions are unwound suddenly. With funding rates and open interest climbing across major assets, the next few days will be crucial. If bulls can push BTC above $90K and sustain momentum, the recovery may continue. But failure to break this resistance — combined with excessive leverage — could lead to another round of long liquidations and renewed selling pressure.

Bitcoin is currently trading at $84,900 as bulls test a major technical milestone: the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Just above lies the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) near $87,300, placing BTC less than 3% away from breaking through both critical resistance zones. These indicators often serve as long-term trend signals, and reclaiming them would strengthen the case for a full recovery rally.

If bulls manage to push the price above the recent local high at $88,800, it could confirm a short-term trend reversal and open the path toward $94K and beyond. Momentum is building following a 15% surge over the past few days, supported in part by macroeconomic relief, including a 90-day pause on US tariffs.

However, risks remain. Failing to hold the $82K support level would be a bearish signal, likely triggering increased selling pressure. A decisive move below $82K could drag BTC back under $80K, erasing recent gains and placing bulls on the defensive once again. With volatility still elevated and market sentiment mixed, the coming days will be crucial in determining whether BTC can sustain this upward momentum or face renewed downside.

Strategy may have resumed its Bitcoin purchases after a one-week break. Michael Saylor, the company's executive chairman, posted the Bitcoin tracker on X on Sunday, a move that typically hints at an upcoming purchase announcement.

No Tariffs on Orange Dots pic.twitter.com/Cg3bCVPMcM

— Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 13, 2025

Saylor's tweet comes after Strategy reported approximately $6 billion in unrealized losses on its Bitcoin holdings during Q1 2025.

The company acquired 80,715 BTC in the quarter at an average price of about $94,922 per coin, during which Bitcoin prices fell nearly 12% in its worst quarterly performance since 2018.

Strategy temporarily halted Bitcoin purchases in the week ending April 6 due to a lack of stock offering purchases for its MSTR and STRK securities.

The company has invested about $35 billion in Bitcoin at an average price of $67,485 per coin, resulting in roughly $8.6 billion in unrealized gains.

Its most recent purchase, announced on March 31, added 22,048 Bitcoin worth $1.9 billion, bringing its total holdings to 528,185 BTC – nearly 3% of Bitcoin's total supply. The holdings are currently valued at around $44 billion.

Bitcoin has experienced volatility this week, falling below $75,000 on Monday before recovering above $80,000 amid rising US-China trade tensions.

The digital asset trades at approximately $83,700 today, showing a slight decline over the past 24 hours, per TradingView.

 Lomond School becomes the first in the UK to accept Bitcoin for tuition and launch a curriculum in BTC and Austrian economics with Saifedean Ammous. 

Lomond School, a private institution in Scotland, will begin accepting Bitcoin for tuition payments and is collaborating with Bitcoin author Saifedean Ammous to introduce a new curriculum focused on Bitcoin and Austrian economics.  

Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, is developing an educational curriculum combining the principles of Bitcoin (BTC) and Austrian economics.

“I'm going to be working with Lomond School to develop a curriculum for bitcoin and Austrian economics,” Ammous wrote in an April 12 X post, sharing his excitement for “making the material widely available worldwide.”

Source: Saifedean Ammous

Lomond School Principal Claire Chisholm confirmed the collaboration on April 12, writing that she was “thrilled to be working with Dr. Ammous” and appreciative of the “positivity of the Bitcoin community.”

The news comes a day after Lomond School announced it would accept BTC for tuition payments starting from the autumn semester of 2025, becoming the first school in the United Kingdom to adopt BTC payments.

Ammous is best known for The Bitcoin Standard, which was first published in 2018. The book outlines the economic philosophy behind Bitcoin and contrasts it with fiat currency systems. It has sold more than one million copies and has been translated into 38 languages, according to Ammous.

Cointelegraph has contacted both Ammous and Lomond School for additional details regarding the upcoming curriculum.

Educational institutions around the world have increasingly embraced Bitcoin as both a subject of academic study and a financial tool.

Schools and universities have been launching Bitcoin-based courses since as early as 2013 when the University of Nicosia in Cyprus launched its Master's in Digital Currency program, which is accessible both in-person and online.

New York University's Stern School of Business launched “The Law and Business of Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies” course in 2014 — one of the first Bitcoin-specific courses in the US.

Stanford University also launched its “Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies” course in 2015, focused on the technological and economic aspects of the world's first cryptocurrency.

Widely followed crypto analyst Rekt Capital says that Bitcoin (BTC) is displaying textbook pre-rally behavior as technical indicators and price action flash green.

The pseudonymous analyst tells his 543,000 followers on the social media platform X that BTC is showing bullish divergence with the relative strength index (RSI).

A bullish divergence happens when a momentum-focused indicator like the RSI trends higher while price goes lower or sideways, suggesting a foreshadowing of price reversal.

Rekt Capital points out there were similar divergences in August of 2024, August of 2023 and November of 2022.

“Bitcoin is developing yet another Higher Low on the RSI while forming Lower Lows on the price.

Overall, throughout the cycle, Bitcoin has formed Bullish Divergences like this on a few occasions already.

Each Bull Div preceded reversals to the upside.”

Zooming in, the analyst says that BTC's downward trend is officially broken once a clean break of the lower high structure, currently at around $82,000, occurs.

“Bitcoin has successfully retested red as support and the Daily RSI Higher Low continues to maintain itself as well.

Growing signs of a maturing Bullish Divergence here, with price just below the key Price Downtrend (blue).

BTC needs to break this Downtrend to enable the Bull Div to play out.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $84,789, slightly above Rekt Capital's blue, downward trend line depicted in the chart, suggesting that the reversal may be underway.

Ethereum surprised the market with a powerful bounce on Wednesday, surging more than 21% from its recent low of $1,380. The move came shortly after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China, which now faces a 145% tariff. This development injected optimism into global markets, triggering a broad recovery across risk assets — with ETH among the top beneficiaries.

Despite the relief rally, Ethereum still trades below critical technical levels, and the broader price structure suggests ongoing consolidation rather than a confirmed reversal. Analysts remain cautious, as the asset's inability to reclaim the $1,800–$2,000 range keeps the long-term trend in question.

However, on-chain data from CryptoQuant adds an intriguing layer to the current outlook. Ethereum's price is still trading below its realized price — the average price at which all ETH in circulation last moved. Historically, this scenario has represented a high-probability accumulation zone, often appearing once per cycle.

According to some analysts, this could present a rare buying opportunity for contrarian investors willing to look beyond short-term volatility and macro uncertainty. As Ethereum continues to consolidate, all eyes are on whether bulls can build on this momentum.

Ethereum Faces Critical Test Amid Volatility And Trade Tensions

Ethereum is at a pivotal point after enduring weeks of relentless selling pressure and extreme volatility. The broader market has been shaken by macroeconomic uncertainty and escalating global trade tensions, with US tariffs under Trump's administration continuing to rattle investor confidence. The crypto market, particularly altcoins like Ethereum, has taken the brunt of this instability. ETH has lost over 60% of its value since late December, raising fears of a prolonged bear market.

However, a shift may be unfolding. Bulls are beginning to reappear, with Ethereum bouncing and setting a strong support above $1,400. This recovery follows aggressive price swings not only in crypto but also in global equities, which have seen significant rebounds following the announcement of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China.

Still, Ethereum remains below crucial resistance levels, especially the $2,000 mark — a level that represents more than just a psychological barrier. According to top analyst Quinten Francois, ETH is currently trading under its realized price, which averages the cost basis of all coins in circulation.

Historically, such conditions have presented rare buying opportunities. Francois suggests this might be a once-in-a-cycle — or even once-in-a-lifetime — chance for long-term investors to accumulate ETH at undervalued levels. The coming days will determine whether bulls can reclaim key resistance and shift sentiment toward a sustained recovery.

Price Action Details: Key Levels To Reclaim

Ethereum is currently trading at $1,650 after failing to break above the $1,700 level, a psychological and technical barrier that continues to cap bullish momentum. Despite a sharp rebound earlier in the week, ETH remains stuck in a consolidation range and is struggling to find direction amid broader market uncertainty.

For bulls to regain control and initiate a stronger recovery, Ethereum must push above the $1,850 mark — a level aligned with the 4-hour 200-day moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA). These indicators have acted as short-term resistance since ETH fell below the $2,000 mark in February and reclaiming them is critical for confirming a shift in trend.

However, if Ethereum fails to break above $1,750 in the coming days, downside risk increases significantly. A rejection at current levels could trigger another wave of selling, potentially sending the price below the $1,500 support zone. This would put further pressure on bulls and undermine recent gains.

With market sentiment still fragile and macroeconomic uncertainty weighing on investor confidence, Ethereum remains at a crucial juncture where a decisive move above resistance is needed to shift the outlook from bearish to neutral.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has named the notorious Solana-based meme coin factory Pump.fun as an example of a bad cryptocurrency application alongside failed projects like FTX and Terra/Luna.

Earlier, Buterin repeatedly criticized meme coin projects, urging the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector to prioritize ethical growth.

Last year, the Ethereum co-founder said that he wanted to see ""higher quality"" fun projects that would be able to contribute to the ecosystem in a positive way.

Meanwhile, Pump.fun has now seeped into the mainstream with a recent episode of dystopian TV series ""Black Mirror"" featuring what appears to be a parody of the infamous meme coin factory. ""Common People,"" the first episode of the show's seventh season, features a working-class man performing degrading acts live on a website called ""Dum Dummies"" in exchange for digital money to afford a more expensive subscription tier of the high-tech system that keeps his wife alive.

Some cryptocurrency users have noted the parallels after various meme coin creators went viral due to performing humiliating and dangerous stunts on Pump.fun to promote their meme coins.

After suspending the livestreaming feature due to heavy backlash, the meme coin platform recently brought it back for a limited number of users.

In his Warpcast post, Buterin stressed that it was ""crucially important"" to have good ideas for apps. This is where ""good social philosophy"" is needed most of all, according to the Ethereum co-founder.

""Apps are ~80% special purpose. What apps you build depends heavily on what ideas you have of what Ethereum apps (and Ethereum as a whole) are there to do for the world,"" he said.

New York may soon allow residents to use digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum to pay for services tied to the state.

A proposed piece of legislation, introduced by Assemblyman Clyde Vanel, aims to update existing laws so that various state departments can accept cryptocurrency as a valid form of payment.

Known as Assembly Bill A7788, the proposal outlines how New Yorkers could use select cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash—to settle government-related costs. These include taxes, penalties, fees, and even rent owed to public agencies.

To cover the technical costs associated with accepting digital currencies, the bill would let the state apply a small service charge. However, this fee cannot be more than the actual cost of processing the transaction, such as blockchain fees or third-party processor charges.

This isn't the only crypto-focused legislative effort in the state. Another bill, A06515, was introduced earlier to crack down on crypto-related fraud and deceptive schemes like rug pulls, signaling a broader effort by lawmakers to both regulate and embrace blockchain technologies.

National attention on the sector has also grown following the return of Donald Trump to the presidency. His campaign promised stronger support for crypto innovation, which has encouraged multiple states to explore integration strategies.

Assembly Bill A7788 is still in the early stages, currently awaiting review by the Assembly Committee. If it gains approval and clears the state Senate, New York could become a trailblazer by enabling crypto payments for government obligations.







Japan is preparing to reshape its crypto regulations with a fresh proposal that would divide digital assets into two distinct categories—one for business-backed tokens and another for decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Lomond School in Scotland is set to make history as the first educational institution in the United Kingdom to accept Bitcoin for tuition payments, marking a significant step in the broader adoption of digital assets in traditional sectors.

Concerns over the unchecked rise of cryptocurrencies have prompted New York Attorney General Letitia James to call on Congress for immediate intervention.

Bitcoin mining giants continued to thrive in early 2025, collectively generating close to $800 million in newly minted BTC as prices remained close to all-time highs.

In April 2025, the cryptocurrency market has been volatile due to macroeconomic factors and political developments. After crypto's black Monday dip, the market is now experiencing a surge in the prices of cryptocurrency after President Trump issued a 90-day pause on the tariffs. For example, Bitcoin, which traded at $74,500 before the pause on the tariffs, surged above $80,000 after Trump paused the tariffs.

With all that going on, crypto investors seem to have more confidence in the crypto market. Prices are likely to continue soaring, presenting a perfect opportunity to buy altcoins. For investors asking, “What are the best altcoins to buy now?” this surge could offer a prime opportunity to diversify your portfolios with crypto projects that combine innovation, utility, and growth potential. Among the best altcoins to buy now include Dawgz AI ($DAGZ), an Ethereum-based AI-powered meme coin that incorporates AI and blockchain technology into its ecosystem.



The recent trends in the cryptocurrency markets have shaped the growth of altcoins. Among the factors include:

When evaluating the best altcoins to buy now, established coins with proven track records offer stability. Here are three standout options:

Among the best altcoins to buy now, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) stands out due to its innovative blend of AI and community engagement. It is built on Ethereum and uses AI trading bots to analyze markets in real time, aiming to deliver consistent returns with minimal effort from holders. Unlike traditional altcoins, $DAGZ focuses on community engagement through meme contests and rewards, creating a fun and purposeful ecosystem.

The project's smart contract, audited by SolidProof, ensures transparency and security, thereby building trust among investors. With a total supply of 8,888,888,888 tokens, $DAGZ balances accessibility with long-term growth potential.

 

Currently priced at $0.004, it's positioned for those seeking entry into a project with both entertainment and utility. narrative.

Ethereum continues to dominate as the leading smart contract platform. Its recent upgrades have improved scalability and energy efficiency, making it a backbone of DeFi and Web3 applications. Priced around $1,557 at the time of writing per CoinMarketCap, ETH benefits from institutional adoption, with firms like BlackRock launching Ethereum-based ETFs. Its ecosystem supports thousands of decentralized apps and memecoins like $DAGZ, ensuring long-term relevance. For investors, Ethereum's balance of innovation and stability makes it a top pick.

Solana has cemented its reputation for speed and cost-efficiency, making it ideal for DeFi and NFT projects. Currently trading at approximately $118 according to CoinMarketCap, SOL has rebounded from 2024 lows, driven by developer activity and partnerships. Its ability to handle high-volume transactions without spiking fees positions it for growth as adoption scales. Solana's vibrant ecosystem also makes it one of the best altcoins to buy now for those eyeing scalability-focused projects.

Dogecoin, currently priced at $0.1583 on CoinMarketCap, is seeing a market surge because of its community-driven approach. Its unlimited supply and fast transaction speeds make it a go-to for microtransactions and tipping. Backed by a passionate community and occasional endorsements from high-profile figures, DOGE thrives on social momentum. Although it is volatile, its liquidity and brand recognition make it a compelling choice during market surges.



At a time when Trump's pause on tariffs is creating a surge in crypto prices, many investors are flocking to secure their spots on altcoins with technological advancement and real-world utility with a strong community backup.

Among the altcoins to consider is Dawgz AI. It is a project that allows you to invest and earn profits with minimal effort using its AI trading algorithm that analyzes the markets and executes trades. Other altcoins to consider buying now include Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana.

Dawgz AI is one of the best altcoins to invest in today. It has AI trading bots that can analyze the market, execute trades, and make profits with minimal effort. If you are an investor who doesn't have much time to analyze the market, Dawgz AI can assist you make the best out of your crypto. Other altcoins to consider investing in include Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Solana (SOL).

Altcoins with the highest potential are those that are incorporating AI technology, meme culture, and community hype. For example, altcoins like Dawgz AI and Dogecoin have great potential because they are AI-powered, and they also thrive on community hype through their social media following and the active participation of their fans. Other altcoins with potential include Solana and Cardano.

Altcoins with community-driven models are likely to pump. For example, $DAGZ has a lot of community engagement through contests and rewards. Besides, its AI utility aligns with the market trends in 2025. For example, Dogecoin saw a 25% spike during the first quarter as a result of community engagement.

Any coin that is contending to become the next Bitcoin must consider investors' interest and market supply. A coin like $DAGZ has potential because of its small total supply of 8,888,888,888,  which will increase the token price as demand increases. With 20% allocated for staking and 15% for community rewards, Dawgz AI will encourage long-term holding and engagement.

Crypto World News

April 13, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

What if the crypto portfolio you've been building is missing a few game-changers? In an industry fueled by constant innovation and fast-paced shifts, sticking with just the top names could mean missing out on massive upside potential. That's why professional crypto advisors and market analysts are increasingly leaning toward a broader diversification strategy. They're spotlighting lesser-discussed but high-utility assets that aren't just buzz-worthy—they're actually building the future of Web3, infrastructure, and real-world blockchain applications. For those looking to gain exposure beyond the standard set of tokens, it's time to explore the best altcoins to buy this week that can hold their ground through market fluctuations and even thrive during recovery phases.

One standout that's been drawing strong attention lately is Qubetics ($TICS). Unlike fleeting trends or meme tokens with no fundamentals, Qubetics is rolling out a highly structured presale paired with Web3 tech utility that's hard to ignore. As one of the best altcoins to buy this week, it's not just about a future promise—it's already executing. With more than $16 million raised so far and over 507 million tokens sold, Qubetics is solidifying its position in the blockchain ecosystem. And with the 29th stage of its presale now live, participants are watching this one closely. Whether you're new to diversification or seasoned in DeFi, Qubetics deserves a spot on your radar.

Qubetics isn't just a coin—it's the world's first Web3 aggregator that unites major blockchains into a single, cohesive ecosystem. What makes it more compelling is the suite of developer and business tools it introduces, including the powerful QubeQode IDE. This integrated development environment allows users—whether they're startups, freelance developers, or large corporations—to build dApps across multiple chains without ever leaving the platform. Imagine a fintech startup wanting to launch a cross-chain lending app but having to juggle Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana separately. With QubeQode IDE, that multi-chain integration becomes seamless, saving time, cost, and talent bandwidth.

What if the clock is literally ticking on the biggest crypto opportunity of the week? Qubetics isn't just another presale—it's quickly becoming one of the best altcoins to buy this week. The project is in its 29th stage, with the token priced at $0.1573, and the structure is tight: every presale stage lasts just 7 days, ending sharply at Sunday 12 AM with a guaranteed 10% price increase. So far, the Qubetics presale has already pulled in over $16 million, attracted more than 24,600 token holders, and sold a whopping 507 million $TICS tokens. And with the mainnet going live in Q2 2025, this isn't just early—it's perfect timing.

Here's what that could actually mean for your wallet. A $100 investment right now at the current price gets you 636 $TICS tokens. If Qubetics reaches $1, that's $636 back in your pocket—already a 535.65% ROI. But things get even better at higher projections: at $5, your $100 turns into $3,078.26, and at $6, you're sitting on $3,713.88. By the time it hits $10 after mainnet launch, that becomes $6,256.47, and at $15, it could reach $9,434.71. It's no wonder the Qubetics presale is being called the best crypto presale right now—and hands down one of the best altcoins to buy this week if you're serious about catching the next breakout before everyone else does.

Why This Coin Made it to This List: Qubetics is creating a unified Web3 development experience while rewarding its ecosystem participants with massive growth potential. Its presale structure, utility stack, and ROI projections make it a frontrunner among the best altcoins to buy this week right now.

Expect its influence to grow as Ethereum moves toward full sharding in future upgrades.

Why This Coin Made it to This List: Arbitrum's tech maturity, developer flexibility, and growing dominance in Layer-2 scaling solidify its position among the best altcoins to buy this week for scalable Ethereum exposure.

Toncoin was originally built by Telegram's developers and has since matured into a high-throughput blockchain with a focus on mass adoption through messaging and social media integration. The TON ecosystem is now thriving with fast transactions, low fees, and native wallet support directly inside the Telegram app. This creates an organic onramp for millions of users globally—something no other blockchain has achieved with such efficiency.

The recent push into NFTs, DeFi, and social tokens is drawing major attention, especially with Telegram planning more TON-based in-app tools and mini-programs. With scalable architecture and user-first design, Toncoin could become the first Web3-native chain to onboard non-crypto users en masse, starting from Telegram's 700M+ user base.

Why This Coin Made it to This List: Toncoin blends scalability with mass-user accessibility, and its direct integration with a globally dominant app makes it one of the best altcoins to buy this week for mainstream crypto onboarding.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins to Buy Now as Altcoins Surge on Policy News","https://moneycheck.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-now-as-altcoins-surge-on-policy-news/","Sun, 13 Apr 2025 13:38:42 GMT","

Altcoins are gaining traction as global policy discussions clear the path for broader crypto use. Investors are watching closely as regulations become more defined and access becomes easier.

This renewed interest is not just about short-term price action. It's about tokens that are building something useful and staying active while the market shifts. Developers and communities are responding to the policy momentum with real progress.

This article will explore what makes an altcoin worth watching now. We'll also look at a few gaining ground, including Dawgz AI, an Ethereum-based project that uniquely combines AI functionality with meme culture.



Table of Contents

Recent policy developments have brought a new level of clarity to the cryptocurrency sector. In the United States, initiatives like the repeal of SAB121 have enabled banks to offer crypto services more freely, opening avenues for broader adoption. The European Union has implemented the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), creating a comprehensive framework for crypto oversight. This new regulation offers legal clarity for both investors and service providers.​

This regulatory progress has instilled confidence among institutional investors, leading to increased allocations in digital assets. A survey conducted by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon revealed that 84% of institutional investors increased their crypto holdings in 2024, citing regulatory clarity as a primary driver.​

As a result, altcoins that demonstrate real-world utility and maintain transparent operations are gaining attention. Projects like Dawgz AI, which focus on practical applications and community engagement, are well-positioned to benefit from this shift in the investment market.​

Not every altcoin showing green candles is built for long-term value. The ones worth watching are usually backed by projects that keep building through market slowdowns and stay transparent with their goals.

A solid altcoin should serve a clear purpose. That might mean powering smart contracts, offering AI tools, or enabling user-focused apps. Fixed supply, audit completion, and public access to smart contracts are also key credibility markers.

Community strength matters. Projects like Dawgz AI that remain active during uncertain conditions gain attention when the market picks up. Their momentum is built on consistent updates and visible progress, not just price swings.

Dawgz AI is an Ethereum-based token that blends meme culture with functional AI tools. It doesn't depend on NFTs or empty hype. Instead, it introduces on-chain AI integrations designed to support real use. This includes AI-backed tools to give users better control their interactions with markets and blockchain-based applications. The token has a fixed supply of 8.888 billion, publicly verifiable through its smart contract.

As blockchain adoption increases, Dawgz AI continues to grow its user base and roll out updates. The project is audited and community-led. It hosts regular engagement campaigns such as meme contests and open development discussions. These signs point to a project focused on building rather than chasing attention.

Ethereum remains the most widely used innovative contract platform in crypto. According to Binance, as of April 11,  2025, it trades at around $1,556.20 with a market cap of $187.90 billion. While the current price is down from recent highs, Ethereum continues to support thousands of decentralized applications across sectors like finance, identity, and gaming.

Its switch to proof-of-stake has cut energy use and improved the protocol's ability to scale. Ethereum's Layer 2 networks have also gained adoption as developers look for cheaper ways to deploy on-chain logic. These factors give it staying power and support strong investor interest during downturns. Despite volatility, Ethereum remains a core holding for many who believe in the future of on-chain systems.

Cardano is a blockchain platform that emphasizes a research-driven approach to development. It utilizes a unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called Ouroboros, aiming for scalability and sustainability. According to Binance, as of April 11, 2025, ADA is currently priced at approximately $0.62, with a market capitalization of around $22.27 billion.​

The platform's focus on formal methods and peer-reviewed research sets it apart in crypto. With ongoing developments and a commitment to academic rigor, Cardano continues to attract attention from developers and investors seeking a strong and scientifically grounded blockchain solution.​

The shift toward practical blockchain use has opened the door for tokens that do more than follow trends. Investors pay closer attention to projects that continue building through slower periods and provide tools that people can use directly. These are often the projects that last longer than price cycles.

Dawgz AI stands out in this category. It runs on Ethereum and combines meme-focused community energy with functional on-chain AI systems. The project does not depend on NFTs or vague speculation. Instead, it focuses on automation tools and real-time decision features that aim to give users more value from their interaction with blockchain.

The token supply is fixed at 8.888 billion and can be verified on-chain. A full audit has been completed through SolidProof, which is helping build early trust. The project is in its presale phase and has already raised over $3 million of its $3.6 million goal, pointing to growing interest. With open development updates, meme contests, and active community participation, Dawgz AI is gaining traction by focusing on function, not just attention.

Smart entries often come when the noise fades, but progress continues. Instead of waiting for price spikes, watch for steady growth in development, wallet activity, and user engagement. These signs usually mean a project is moving forward regardless of market pressure.

A dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy can reduce the risk of mistiming the market. Track audit reports, presale progress, and how often the team communicates updates. If you're searching for the best altcoins to buy now, look at projects like Dawgz AI that remain consistent through the dip. These tokens often show stronger recovery when attention returns because they kept building when others paused.



Altcoins are gaining renewed attention as policy news provides more straightforward rules and substantial support. This cycle looks different. Projects are judged not just on speculation but on what they build and how they engage when attention is low.

The focus is shifting toward tokens that create value and remain active during quiet periods. Dawgz AI is one of those projects. It continues to grow its community while introducing AI tools that give users a reason to stay involved.

If you're looking for a token that blends utility with strong community traction, now is a good time to look closer. Visit Dawgz AI to explore what's happening behind the scenes.

An altcoin should offer real utility, transparent tokenomics, and consistent progress regardless of market conditions. Projects like Dawgz AI, which continue development during quieter periods, often hold long-term potential.

Clearer regulations often boost investor confidence and bring more attention to utility-driven tokens. This shift can benefit emerging projects like Dawgz AI, primarily when they operate with transparency and a clear use case.

Early-stage investments carry risk, but looking at audits, supply transparency, and active development can help reduce that risk. Dawgz AI offers public audit results and a fixed token supply, which adds an extra layer of accountability.

No prediction is specific, but tokens gaining traction through real progress tend to stand out. Dawgz AI has drawn attention for its on-chain AI tools and active presale phase.

This new technology marks a unique opportunity for crypto enthusiasts.

With great power comes great responsibility, and cryptocurrency is no exception. It usually takes a ton of energy to operate, but Algorand — a digital currency developed in 2017 — changed a key part of the technology, according to Blockchain Magazine.

It's OK if you're unfamiliar with the language around this stuff or how it all works. Without getting into the weeds too much, all you have to know is that creating crypto relies on a secure ledger called the blockchain to manage transactions and that the standard way of using the blockchain sucks a ton of electrical power from the grid. 

What Algorand did was simplify how users interact with the blockchain when buying or selling Algorand currency. The result is a crypto coin that requires drastically less energy to keep up and running, Blockchain Magazine reported.

Since much of the electric grid system still relies on burning dirty fuel sources to make energy, the Algorand solution is a win for keeping the planet cool and clean for us humans to live on. It also marks a unique opportunity for crypto enthusiasts, as more businesses are starting to lean on Algorand to power sustainable finance, the outlet explained.

Despite weathering volatility during economic shifts, crypto owners frequently celebrate many coins as forms of money that operate in some ways more securely — and often less hierarchically — than traditional financial accounts.

However, the world of cryptocurrency still has a long way to go to minimize its strain on the grid and environmental impact. 

Some critics also argue that Algorand's way of doing crypto is less secure and more centralized than the usual way things work. Others maintain that Algorand's system could change the whole crypto landscape and be a real competitor to other popular coins, such as Ethereum, which switched to a less energy-intensive ""proof of stake"" model in 2022. 

""[Algorand] … is a game-changer in the blockchain industry,"" fintech expert Dr. Lisa Benton said, per Blockchain Magazine. ""If the industry continues to prioritize sustainability, Algorand will be a benchmark for future blockchain networks.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","AI and Blockchain at the Paris Blockchain Week: between privacy, energy, and digital freedom","https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2025/04/13/ai-and-blockchain-at-the-paris-blockchain-week-between-privacy-energy-and-digital-freedom/","Sun, 13 Apr 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

We at Cryptonomist were present at the Paris Blockchain Week, where a high-level panel was held dedicated to the future of artificial intelligence in synergy with blockchain technology. A heated discussion, rich in technical and ethical insights, highlighted the opportunities and contradictions of this technological convergence. From the management of personal data to the energy cost of AI, up to the user sovereignty, the debate touched on the critical points of tomorrow's Web3.

Taking the stage were Amelia Daly, Kevin Riou, Claudio Bedino, Ethan Pierse, and Aymen Soufi, five industry experts who offered complementary and in-depth perspectives on how to tackle the mass adoption of blockchain thanks to artificial intelligence.

Summary

The panel opened with a surprising reflection: every interaction with ChatGPT or similar costs about 0.46 dollars. A figure that includes energy consumption, computing power, and the infrastructure necessary to generate real-time responses. This cost does not fall on the end user, especially if they use free versions. But then, who pays the bill?

The answer is as simple as it is unsettling: value is extracted from our data. The user, in exchange for free access, gives up valuable information that is processed, stored, and often monetized. A well-known dynamic, which makes a different, more ethical, and decentralized approach even more urgent.

Precisely in this context, the blockchain comes into play, seen as a tool for privacy protection and returning control to users. One of the speakers emphasized how, through tokenization and decentralized architectures, it is possible to break the monopoly of big tech, which today hold enormous amounts of personal data.

AI and blockchain together can create new models of information governance, in which the user decides how, when, and with whom to share their data. Not only in the financial sector, but also in sensitive areas such as health, education, and energy consumption.

A hot topic of the panel was the energy required for artificial intelligence, often compared to that of blockchain. While in past years Bitcoin and other Proof-of-Work projects have been targeted for high consumption, today AI uses even greater amounts of electricity, without facing the same wave of criticism.

“We spend years justifying the energy use of mining and now no one discusses the climate cost of memes generated by ChatGPT”, observed one of the speakers. A clear invitation to evaluate innovation with consistency and transparency, beyond the trends of the moment.

The central issue of the discussion focused on individual sovereignty. The blockchain was created as a disintermediation technology, where each user is responsible for their own keys and decisions. But what happens if we delegate these choices to an agentic AI, capable of signing transactions or managing wallets?

According to some experts, there is a risk of recreating the intermediary, precisely the one that the crypto ecosystem had tried to eliminate. The adoption of overly autonomous AI could erode the concept of personal custody and create new forms of technological dependency.

Despite these critical issues, all panel participants recognized the enormous potential of AI as a support tool. From energy consumption forecasts to optimized asset management, intelligenza artificiale can simplify users' lives and increase the accuracy of decisions.

“AI must help humans make decisions, not make them in their place”, stated one of the panelists, emphasizing that the correct approach is one of collaboration, not substitution.

Among the mentioned use cases, the following stand out:

However, it was also reiterated that the current AI agents are still primitive. Most are limited to speculative operations like trading, often ineffectively. The challenge is to develop more sophisticated, contextual, and controllable models.

The panel of the Paris Blockchain Week has shone a spotlight on one of the most crucial topics for the future of Web3. The combination of AI and blockchain offers extraordinary possibilities, but also requires attention, ethics, and conscious design.

The real issue at stake is not just technical, but cultural: who will control the data, models, and decisions of the future? We at Cryptonomist will continue to closely follow this evolution, to report with expertise and transparency on the challenges and opportunities of the new digital ecosystem.

Blockchain adoption is rising fast in 2025. Governments are exploring tokenized systems, major financial institutions are testing innovative contract platforms, and developers are launching tools that bring blockchain closer to everyday use. The shift from hype to real-world applications is becoming clear.

At the same time, crypto prices have pulled back across the board. For investors focused on long-term value, this creates rare opportunities. Lower prices don't always signal weakness. They often reflect a cooling-off period where serious projects build while noise fades.

One project gaining quiet traction during this reset is Dawgz AI. It runs on Ethereum and blends meme culture with on-chain AI features. While many tokens slow down, Dawgz AI continues to build tools and grow its user base. In this article, we'll explore what makes a crypto project worth investing in during a dip and why some assets, including Dawgz AI, stand out in price and purpose.



Table of Contents

Blockchain adoption is accelerating in 2025, with over 300 million people worldwide using blockchain technology, representing approximately 3.9% of the global population. According to Security.org, about 28% of adults, or roughly 65 million individuals, own cryptocurrencies in the United States alone.

This widespread adoption is not limited to individual users; institutions also embrace blockchain. The global blockchain market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 58.3%, reaching $306 billion by 2030. This growth is driven by increased demand for decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized real-world assets, and enterprise applications.​

As blockchain becomes more integrated into different sectors, investors seek projects offering real utility and long-term potential. This environment presents opportunities to identify and invest in undervalued assets and is positioned to benefit from blockchain technology's ongoing expansion.

Rising blockchain adoption has brought more visibility to promising projects, but not all tokens are built for long-term relevance. Investors should look for straightforward utility. A token should have a role beyond speculation, powering smart contracts, enabling on-chain tools, or supporting AI-based features; purpose matters.

Strong projects also maintain transparency. A fixed token supply, verified smart contracts, and third-party audits help build trust. Developer activity is another sign of health. You can track this through public GitHub repositories or network upgrades.

Community strength matters too. Active users and consistent engagement often point to more substantial recovery potential after a dip in a growing ecosystem. Dawgz AI, for example, continues to build and engage while adoption expands, making it a project worth watching.

Dawgz AI is an Ethereum-based token that blends meme culture with functional AI tools. It doesn't depend on NFTs or empty hype. Instead, it introduces on-chain AI integrations designed to support real use. This includes AI-backed tools to give users better control their interactions with markets and blockchain-based applications.

As blockchain adoption increases, Dawgz AI continues to grow its user base and roll out updates. The project is audited and community-led. It hosts regular engagement campaigns such as meme contests and open development discussions. Currently in its presale phase, it has raised over $3 million out of a $3.6 million goal, signaling clear early traction. These signs point to a project focused on building rather than chasing attention.

Ethereum remains the most widely used innovative contract platform in crypto. According to Binance, as of April 2025, it trades at around $1,553.78 with a market cap of $187.84 billion. While the current price is down from recent highs, Ethereum continues to support thousands of decentralized applications across sectors like finance, identity, and gaming.

Its switch to proof-of-stake has cut energy use and improved the protocol's ability to scale. Ethereum's Layer 2 networks have also gained adoption as developers look for cheaper ways to deploy on-chain logic. These factors give it staying power and support strong investor interest during downturns. Despite volatility, Ethereum remains a core holding for many who believe in the future of on-chain systems.

Chainlink connects smart contracts to off-chain data, giving blockchains access to real-time prices, weather feeds, and verified event data. According to Binance, as of April 11, 2025, LINK trades at around $12.52 and has a market cap of roughly $7.82 billion. Secure data delivery will become more critical as more institutions use tokenized systems.

The project has partnered with major financial firms and blockchain platforms. Its ability to connect blockchains to real-world information has made it essential for building reliable decentralized applications. Chainlink continues to launch new features and integrations. It remains one of the few utility tokens with enterprise backing and consistent developer traction.

The rise in blockchain adoption has created space for tokens that mix functionality with culture. Investors are starting to pay closer attention to projects that are built during downturns and offer something users can actually interact with. These projects tend to survive shifts in market cycles.

Dawgz AI is one of them. Built on Ethereum, it combines meme-driven community appeal with on-chain AI tools. Instead of focusing on NFTs or short-term attention, the project focuses on practical applications like AI-powered systems running directly on-chain. These tools are designed to support users with real-time decision-making and automation, not just token speculation.

The token has a fixed supply of 8.888 billion, and its smart contract is publicly available. A third-party audit from SolidProof was completed to help build early trust. With regular updates, meme contests, and community engagement, Dawgz AI is positioning itself as a project that doesn't just participate in hype but builds through it. For more insights, please check out this video:

Buying during a dip is less about finding the lowest price and more about identifying when real value aligns with strong fundamentals. One practical strategy is dollar-cost averaging (DCA), which spreads investment across multiple entries rather than guessing the bottom.

Pay attention to project activity. Teams that continue development, share updates, and engage during slow markets often signal a long-term focus. When researching newer tokens, also track wallet movement, presale metrics, and audit status.

If you're exploring the best crypto to buy in the dip, start with assets that still show purpose and transparency when others go quiet. These projects are usually still building for the cycle ahead, not just reacting to it.

Home » India's Assam Embraces AI and Blockchain to Revolutionize Tea Trade

India, recognized as the world's second-largest tea producer after China, is preparing to implement a blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled auction system aimed at increasing transparency and enhancing efficiency within its tea industry. The northeastern state of Assam, which leads the country in tea production, has taken the initiative to roll out this advanced platform in partnership with key stakeholders from the tea sector.

This upcoming digital system is expected to reshape the traditional auction model by facilitating secure transactions and promoting equitable pricing structures. According to official state communications, the AI-powered, blockchain-based platform will be the first of its kind in India. It is projected to enhance operational efficiencies across the supply chain while reinforcing Assam's prominence on the global tea map.

Assam contributes more than half of India's total tea output, making its role in this technological transformation particularly significant. The proposed digital auction platform is intended to provide a trustworthy environment for both buyers and sellers, while minimizing price manipulation and reducing the scope for fraudulent practices.

The plan was outlined in the state's fiscal budget for 2025-26, presented by Finance Minister Ajanta Neog in the Assam Assembly. The government asserted that the initiative would bring substantial improvements to the existing auction mechanisms and contribute to a more transparent, fair, and sustainable ecosystem for tea trade in the region.

Despite Assam's reputation for producing high-quality tea, the existing auction framework has faced criticism due to limited transparency and inefficiencies. By adopting blockchain technology, the state aims to create a decentralized and tamper-proof record of transactions, while the use of AI will help analyze market trends, optimize auction timings, and improve decision-making processes.

Authorities believe the platform will allow fair participation across the board, including small-scale farmers and large estates. By offering data-driven insights and secure interactions, the initiative is designed to provide equal access to market opportunities, thereby supporting inclusive growth within the tea sector. Additionally, the blockchain component is expected to bring greater visibility to the supply chain, benefiting both producers and consumers.

Assam's broader technology-driven development strategy also includes plans for India's first AI-based anti-deepfake and cyber surveillance laboratory. The state government intends to equip the Assam Police with advanced tools to combat emerging digital threats, enhance cybersecurity, and improve digital forensics capabilities.

In parallel, the Assam government is pushing for the modernization of land revenue systems. It is adopting the National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS) under the “One Nation, One Software” initiative. This transition involves the use of geospatial technology for accurate land valuation and the integration of blockchain into NGDRS to enable secure and faster property transactions.

India's tea sector has been under pressure due to recent climate-related disruptions. The Tea Board of India reported a 7.8% drop in tea output during 2024, with production totaling 1,284.78 million kilograms compared to 1,393.66 million kilograms in 2023. The decline, caused by heat waves and flooding during critical harvesting periods, contributed to a spike in prices. The average tea price in 2024 rose by nearly 18%, reaching ₹198.76 ($2.32) per kilogram.

Despite this shortfall, India's tea exports grew by around 10% in 2024, totaling 254.67 million kilograms, up from 231.69 million kilograms in the previous year. Increased demand from countries such as the UAE, Iraq, and Russia contributed to this growth. India primarily exports CTC (crush-tear-curl) teas to markets like Egypt and the United Kingdom, while the orthodox variety finds buyers in Iraq, Iran, and Russia.

By integrating AI and blockchain into its most vital industries, Assam is positioning itself as a leader in digital innovation. These advancements are not only expected to strengthen the state's economy but also serve as a blueprint for similar transformations across other Indian states and sectors.

 The trader sold 62 CryptoPunk NFTs in 2021, earning approximately $7.4 million in profit, followed by the sale of 35 more in 2022 for an additional $4.9 million. 

A non-fungible token (NFT) trader could face up to six years in prison after pleading guilty to underreporting nearly $13 million in profits from trading CryptoPunks, according to the US Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.

Waylon Wilcox, 45, admitted to filing false income tax returns for the 2021 and 2022 tax years. The former CryptoPunk investor pleaded guilty on April 9 to two counts of filing false individual income tax returns, federal prosecutors said in an April 11 press release.

Back in April 2022, Wilcox filed a false individual income tax return for the tax year 2021, which underreported his income tax by roughly $8.5 million and reduced his tax due by approximately $2.1 million.

In October 2023, Wilcox filed another false individual tax income return for the fiscal year of 2022, underreporting his income tax by an estimated $4.6 million and reducing his tax due by nearly $1.1 million.

“The total maximum penalty under federal law for these offenses is up to six years of imprisonment, a term of supervised release following imprisonment, and a fine,” according to the statement. However, the exact details and timing of his sentence remain unclear.

In 2021, Wilcox sold 62 CryptoPunk NFTs for a gain of about $7.4 million but reported significantly less on his taxes. In 2022, he sold 35 more CryptoPunks for $4.9 million. The Department of Justice said Wilcox intentionally selected “no” when asked if he had engaged in digital asset transactions on both filings.

“IRS Criminal Investigation is committed to unraveling complex financial schemes involving virtual currencies and NFT transactions designed to conceal taxable income,” Philadelphia Field Office Special Agent in charge Yury Kruty said, adding: 

The case was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Criminal Investigation Department.

Crypto tax laws attracted interest worldwide in June 2024 after the IRS issued a new crypto regulation making US crypto transactions subject to third-party tax reporting requirements for the first time.

Since January, centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) and other brokers have been required to report the sales and exchanges of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies.

On April 10, US President Donald Trump signed a joint congressional resolution to overturn a Biden administration-era legislation that would have required decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to also report transactions to the IRS.

Set to take effect in 2027, the so-called IRS DeFi broker rule would have expanded the tax authority's existing reporting requirements to include DeFi platforms, requiring them to disclose gross proceeds from crypto sales, including information regarding taxpayers involved in the transactions.

However, some crypto regulatory advisers believe that stablecoin and crypto banking legislation should be a priority above new tax legislation in the US.

A “tailored regulatory approach” for areas including securities laws and removing “obstacles in banking” is a priority for US lawmakers with “more upside” for the industry, Mattan Erder, general counsel at layer-3 decentralized blockchain network Orbs, told Cointelegraph.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","A podcast star helped red-pill Silicon Valley. Now he's Trump's tech czar.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/13/david-sacks-ai-crypto-trump/","Sun, 13 Apr 2025 17:23:43 GMT","

David Sacks led the tech elite's rightward shift. Now the investor and longtime Musk associate is helping Trump unchain the crypto industry.

Before President Donald Trump promised to make America the “crypto capital of the planet” — launching a meme coin, signing two executive orders promoting cryptocurrency and feting executives at the White House — he attended an intimate fundraising dinner at the San Francisco home of tech investor David Sacks.

At the $50,000-a-ticket event, a handful of crypto executives told the presidential candidate that they were being persecuted by the Biden administration, which they said had weaponized the law to thwart the burgeoning industry.

The appeals seemed to resonate with Trump, five guests told The Washington Post, helping lock in his support for crypto, a sector the president had previously called a “scam.”

The dinner was a turning point for both Trump and Sacks, cementing a political alliance that has lifted both men to power in Washington — and stands to transform the fortunes of the crypto industry. A longtime Silicon Valley power broker and associate of Elon Musk, Sacks rallied the tech elite to back Trump's return to the White House. In turn, Trump appointed Sacks to the new role of White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar, putting the investor — and the once-spurned crypto executives — in a position to drive policy on two of the most disruptive sectors in tech.

In an interview with The Post, Sacks described his new role as “being a bit of a bridge” between Silicon Valley and Washington. “My job is to advise on innovation policy based on decades of experience in tech,” Sacks said.

Sacks's influence was notable from Trump's first week in office, when the president unveiled a pair of executive orders on crypto and AI. “They're going to make a lot of money for the country,” Trump said after signing the orders, flanked by Sacks. “And so is David. You have to check him out. There's nobody like this guy.”

In response to the orders, the Justice Department disbanded a unit dedicated to investigating cryptocurrency crimes, directing prosecutors in a memo Monday to pull back on pursuing some cases against the industry.

Tech elites have pinned their hopes on Sacks, banking on him to encourage unfettered growth in AI and to carve out clear rules of the road for crypto. “You're going in to fix the two things that were [on] all of our agendas in Silicon Valley in terms of getting returns for the next four years,” said investor Jason Calacanis, Sacks's co-host on the popular “All-In” podcast, in a March episode.

In recent days, as global markets reacted to Trump's tariff plan and Musk traded barbs with administration advisers, Sacks initially remained focused on his purview, touting from his White House X account new rules to benefit stablecoins.

But as the stock markets recouped some of the historic losses on Tuesday, Sacks took a victory lap: “Black Monday Hoax is over,” he wrote on his personal account on X. The brief rally sputtered, and the S&P 500 closed down 1.5 percent that day — nearing a bear market. It ultimately ended the week up 8 percent, but below its value at the start of the year.

Sacks defended Trump's tariffs strategy on Friday's episode of “All-In.” After Larry Summers, treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, unfavorably compared the U.S. economy to that of Argentina, Sacks countered that Trump had given America “extraordinary leverage over virtually every country in the world.”

Amid economic uncertainty, critics fear that Sacks, who was heavily invested in crypto before divesting for his White House role, will usher in an industry-led free-for-all, leaving consumers vulnerable to scams and volatility. Customers lost more than $8 billion in deposits when the crypto exchange FTX imploded in 2022.

“There's no reason to think that he won't be bringing a view that is ‘corporations first' as opposed to America or Americans first,” said Rick Claypool, research director of Public Citizen, a money-in-politics watchdog group. “It's a tragedy for the American people who rely on the federal government to protect them.”

Crypto companies are surging, buoyed by the new administration. In Congress, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee) steered a bill to legitimize stablecoins — cryptocurrencies pegged to the dollar — through a committee that rejected the proposal under President Joe Biden. Agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have made it easier for banks to work with crypto companies by pledging to not focus on a bank's “reputational risk.”

Through executive order, Trump established a strategic reserve composed of the bitcoin that the federal government has seized through forfeitures, as well as a stockpile of other digital currencies taken by the government. Before Trump took office, cryptocurrency executives and investors pressed Trump to create a reserve to pay down the national debt.

And since Trump took office, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped or paused more than a dozen cases against crypto firms. “The SEC staff make their own decisions about enforcement actions,” a spokesperson for Sacks said.

“This is it — the moment we've been waiting for,” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse posted in March on X, announcing that the SEC would drop its court fight against the company.

Hosting crypto executives for a White House summit last month, Trump pledged to end Biden's “war on crypto” as Sacks marveled at the swift turnaround.

“Your administration is moving at tech speed. It's really amazing,” he said, turning to the president. “It's actually faster than any start-up that I've been part of.”

Sacks has long stood out in Silicon Valley for his conservative bent and his ties to self-proclaimed “PayPal Mafia” iconoclasts such as Peter Thiel and Musk. But the popularity of his podcast “All-In” transformed him into an influencer with the tech set — with some holding him responsible for shifting venture capitalist elites to the right.

Born in Cape Town, South Africa, Sacks came to the United States as a child in the late 1970s when his family immigrated to Tennessee.

He met Thiel as a student at Stanford University and with him co-wrote the 1995 book “The Diversity Myth,” a polemic against political correctness on college campuses that anticipated central concerns of conservative politics today.

“He's earned a lot of street cred for being a voice for this extremely libertarian ideology when it was not in vogue,” said Niki Christoff, a D.C.-based consultant who previously worked in public policy for Salesforce, Uber and Google.

Sacks reunited with Thiel at PayPal. After the company was acquired by eBay in 2002, early employees, including Musk, parlayed their fortunes into building powerful companies such as defense contractor Palantir.

Sacks turned to investing full time after selling work-messaging company Yammer to Microsoft for $1.2 billion in 2012. His firm Craft Ventures focused on business software but took stakes in Musk's companies, including SpaceX, and a handful of AI and crypto start-ups.

A lifelong contrarian, Sacks donated to Mitt Romney in 2012, Hillary Clinton in 2016 and stayed on the sidelines in 2020. After the coronavirus shuttered San Francisco, Sacks and his venture capitalist “besties” started “All-In,” talking for hours each week about business, investing and, increasingly, politics.

Sacks was initially a punchy conservative foil to his centrist co-hosts, who like many in tech had historically backed Democrats. He argued that the U.S. should not support Ukraine's fight against Russia and called for government protections for depositors after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. Over time, the besties — and the tech chattering class as a whole — began to agree more with Sacks.

“They were thinking out loud together, bringing ‘All-In' listeners along for the ride,” said a person close to the White House, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment. “Sacks was the tip of the spear.”

The “All-In” crew endorsed Musk's claims that liberal tech companies quashed free speech and cheered his mass firings at Twitter, where Sacks assisted Musk's takeover.

When the 2024 presidential race  began, Sacks helped launch Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's campaign, co-hosting him and Musk in a conversation streamed on Twitter. Meanwhile, “All-In” hosted independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Republican contender Vivek Ramaswamy — whom Sacks also held fundraisers for — as well as Democrat Dean Phillips. The candidates got access to millions of listeners, while the hosts of “All-In” elevated the priorities of the investor class.

When Trump joined the show in June, he sounded like one of the besties when he explained that the U.S. must double or triple the capacity of its electric grid to compete with China in AI, a realization Trump said he had “at David's house and talking to a lot of geniuses from Silicon Valley.”

Sacks officially endorsed Trump the day of his June fundraiser — more than a month before the attempted assassination of Trump in July, after which Musk and other tech titans embraced the GOP candidate.

“With respect to economic policy, foreign policy, border policy, and legal fairness, Trump performed better” than Biden, Sacks wrote on X, announcing his endorsement.

Sacks was influential in lobbying Trump to pick JD Vance, a protégé of Thiel, for vice president, The Post has reported. As Trump's tech czar, Sacks seized the opportunity to do more than just advise Trump.

Like Musk, Sacks is a “special government employee,” exempt from certain disclosure rules and only permitted to work for the federal government for 130 days a year. “Sacks is staying within that limit by alternating weeks working for the White House and working in the Bay Area,” a spokesperson said.

“He's Team America,” said entrepreneur Trevor Traina, who attended Sacks's fundraiser and was ambassador to Austria in Trump's first term. “An incredibly wealthy guy with a beautiful lifestyle and all that, who doesn't have to be running at full tilt but who chooses to do so.”

Three days before Trump's inauguration, the president-elect underscored that his interest in crypto was also personal.

While Sacks co-hosted the Crypto Ball, a jubilant black-tie affair in D.C., Trump promoted a crypto coin called $TRUMP, launched by companies with ties to his family.

Crypto insiders recognized it as a meme coin, designed to ride online hype. Some became concerned that the “crypto president” might be prioritizing his own portfolio. Trump seemed to be “acting almost as a crypto entrepreneur, which we don't need,” said Nic Carter, founding partner of the investment firm Castle Island Ventures.

Political watchdogs have also raised questions about Sacks's crypto holdings. Sacks pushed back, revealing in sharp X posts that he had voluntarily divested many of his crypto holdings and related investments months earlier.

“The supposed ‘watchdogs' were revealed to be making baseless accusations when the truth came out about David's divestments,” a Sacks spokesperson said.

A White House memo said Sacks and Craft Ventures sold over $200 million in digital assets or related ventures.

Trump's czar appeared to have smoothed over the controversy. “A lot of people think if they're coming to D.C. to do policy, but you're not, you're doing politics,” said one crypto lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation. Yet Sacks may still be asked to lend credibility “to whatever wacky plan a bunch of barbarians have come up with,” the person added.

Silicon Valley executives whom Sacks has called for advice on White House business say he is energized by the challenges of Washington bureaucracy.

Sacks came across more like a sober student of government than a DOGE disciple when he summed up his first few weeks in D.C. on an episode of “All-In.”

Sacks described a news conference where the chairs of four House and Senate committees pledged to pass crypto legislation by year's end.

“There were a lot of people on X who felt like this wasn't a mind-blowing announcement. They wanted something that they could trade on right away,” Sacks said. But such pro-crypto unity in Congress was new. “So that is pretty monumental,” he added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}","cryptocurrency"

Crypto no longer exists in a vacuum. It's now deeply tied to global policy and infrastructure strategy.

In April 2025, the Trump administration imposed sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports, but spared smartphones and computers, signaling that critical digital infrastructure is off-limits – even in trade wars.

In this shifting landscape, investors are flocking to Solaxy ($SOLX), the first Solana Layer 2 built to fix congestion, scale with demand, and bridge Ethereum's massive DeFi liquidity.

It's not just another altcoin – it's the kind of infrastructure today's digital economy is demanding.

UK finance minister Rachel Reeves has called for an “ambitious new relationship” with the EU, signaling efforts to strengthen economic ties with Britain's biggest trading partner. As US tariffs add pressure globally, the UK is clearly prioritizing long-term digital infrastructure.

Meanwhile, in the U.S, President Trump's administration has drawn a clear line between what's considered essential and what's expendable.

Despite tariffs reaching up to 125% on many Chinese goods, smartphones and computers were exempted – underscoring the importance of protecting core technology.

This shift affects crypto, too. As blockchain moves into the mainstream, clunky, isolated platforms are no longer enough. Investors and regulators alike are paying attention to networks that are scalable, reliable, and flexible across ecosystems.

Solaxy ($SOLX) is a new crypto project that fits this global model.

It's the first Layer 2 built on Solana, solving the chain's long-standing issues like congestion and failed transactions, while keeping its biggest strengths: speed and low fees.

As global priorities shift toward protecting and scaling digital infrastructure, Solaxy stands out – not as a niche tool for traders, but as a foundational layer for the future of crypto.

Solaxy ($SOLX) is the first-ever Layer 2 built on Solana – and it's doing what Solana alone couldn't. It eliminates congestion, failed transactions, and scalability limits, while enhancing the chain's key strengths: speed, low fees, and user efficiency.

The native token, $SOLX, is multichain and launching on both Ethereum and Solana.

That means it connects the largest DeFi and asset tokenization ecosystem on Ethereum with the high-speed trading playground of Solana. Traders no longer have to choose between liquidity and performance – they get both.



Solaxy also levels the meme coin battlefield. It gives everyday traders sniper-level speed and reliability without the usual tech barriers.

With most Layer 2 tokens now valued over $1B, Solaxy is emerging as the market leader in a space Solana never had until now.

$SOLX is built for accessibility and massive reach.

The presale accepts cards, $BNB, $ETH, and $SOL – making it easy for buyers across the three most active chains in the world to participate.



With nearly $30M already raised and a current presale price of just $0.001692, this could be the final opportunity to get in before the token hits the open market.

By bridging Ethereum's liquidity with Solana's speed, $SOLX doesn't just expand access – it exponentially increases its own buyer pool, positioning itself as a true gateway to multichain DeFi.

As governments and investors alike get serious about digital infrastructure, the crypto world needs solutions that are fast, scalable, and built for the multichain future.

Solaxy checks every box – and with $SOLX still in presale, smart investors are moving fast to grab their share of what could be the most important Layer 2 launch of the year.

The Trump administration's exemption on tariffs for electronics may be short-lived.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that the White House's decision to exempt items like smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics from steep tariffs earlier this month was only temporary.

A new set of duties focused on semiconductors is expected within “a month or two,” he said.

“All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,” Lutnick said during an interview on ABC's This Week.

The goal, he added, is to encourage chip and flat panel production in the U.S. and reduce dependence on Asian manufacturing. The clarification follows a bulletin from U.S. Customs and Border Protection released late Friday bringing a temporary exemption for a range of key electronics from the reciprocal tariffs President Donald Trump announced earlier this month.

However, Lutnick emphasized that those same items would soon be swept up under a more targeted policy aimed at “national security” industries like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.

“We need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels — we need to have these things made in America,” Lutnick said.

The price of bitcoin dropped roughly 1% on headlines reporting on Lutnick's words, before recovering back to the $84,000 mark. The wider crypto market, measured by the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, is down roughly 1.6% in the last 24-hour period.

A “tailored regulatory approach” for areas including securities laws and removing “obstacles in banking” is a priority for US lawmakers with “more upside” for the industry, Mattan Erder, general counsel at layer-3 decentralized blockchain network Orbs, told Cointelegraph.

 Lomond School becomes the first in the UK to accept Bitcoin for tuition and launch a curriculum in BTC and Austrian economics with Saifedean Ammous. 

Lomond School, a private institution in Scotland, will begin accepting Bitcoin for tuition payments and is collaborating with Bitcoin author Saifedean Ammous to introduce a new curriculum focused on Bitcoin and Austrian economics.  

Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, is developing an educational curriculum combining the principles of Bitcoin (BTC) and Austrian economics.

“I'm going to be working with Lomond School to develop a curriculum for bitcoin and Austrian economics,” Ammous wrote in an April 12 X post, sharing his excitement for “making the material widely available worldwide.”

Ammous is best known for The Bitcoin Standard, which was first published in 2018. The book outlines the economic philosophy behind Bitcoin and contrasts it with fiat currency systems. It has sold more than one million copies and has been translated into 38 languages, according to Ammous.

Cointelegraph has contacted both Ammous and Lomond School for additional details regarding the upcoming curriculum.

Educational institutions around the world have increasingly embraced Bitcoin as both a subject of academic study and a financial tool.

Schools and universities have been launching Bitcoin-based courses since as early as 2013 when the University of Nicosia in Cyprus launched its Master's in Digital Currency program, which is accessible both in-person and online.

New York University's Stern School of Business launched “The Law and Business of Bitcoin and Other Cryptocurrencies” course in 2014 — one of the first Bitcoin-specific courses in the US.

Stanford University also launched its “Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies” course in 2015, focused on the technological and economic aspects of the world's first cryptocurrency.

 Anthony Pompliano said Bitcoiners “figured out a way to financially capture upside if they were right.” 

Bitcoin (BTC) holders were the first to point out flaws in the United States economic data and position themselves for the potential upside, says crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano.

“Bitcoiners were the first large-scale group to recognize the economic data was wrong, and they figured out a way to financially capture upside if they were right,” Pompliano said in an April 12 X post.

“The unspoken secret as to why so many finance folks are wrong in their analysis of the tariffs is because the finance folks believe the government data,” he added.

Amid the widespread uncertainty and ongoing fear over US President Donald Trump's imposed tariffs, Pompliano questioned the accuracy of US inflation figures, job numbers, and GDP statistics. He added that “eventually everyone else will realize the data is inaccurate.” 

It comes after Pompliano pointed out in a March 20 LinkedIn post, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's appearance on the All-In podcast, where Bessent was asked directly if he trusted the data — and replied, “no.”

Concerns about the reliability of US economic data have been brewing for a while. A July 2024 report argued that new approaches are needed to “ensure government statistics remain dependable.”

It comes as ongoing concerns over Trump's imposed tariffs have led some crypto analysts to reinforce the idea that Bitcoin could outlast the US dollar in the long run.

Bitwise Invest head of alpha strategies Jeff Parks said on April 9 that there is a “higher chance Bitcoin survives over the dollar in our lifetime after today.” 

Over the past five days, the US dollar index (DXY) has dropped 3.19%, currently sitting at 99.783 at the time of publication, according to TradingView data.

Several Wall Street analysts were under the belief that Trump's imposed tariffs would bolster the US dollar, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. 

Pompliano said, “The mainstream finance conversation has become an intellectual boondoggle where most people regurgitate ill-informed takes based on bad data.”

Meanwhile, analysts recently pointed out that while the stock market was “tanking” on April 4 amid tariff uncertainty, Bitcoin didn't decline as much as expected. During periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, Bitcoin and crypto assets have historically been more volatile than the stock market.

On April 4, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin was steady above the $82,000 level, and as US equities markets collapsed, Bitcoin rallied to $84,720, reflecting price action, which is uncharacteristic of the norm.

Meanwhile, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes said Bitcoin may be entering what he calls “up only mode,” as a deepening crisis in the US bond market potentially drives investors away from traditional haven assets and toward alternative stores of value.

 DeFi and CeFi campaigns are far more effective at reaching existing crypto users than crypto gaming and gambling campaigns, recent data shows. 

Crypto gaming and gambling campaigns are the most expensive way to acquire users with existing crypto wallets, ranking highest in cost among all sectors of the crypto industry, recent data shows.

“Gaming and gambling campaigns are the most expensive, with a median CPW of $8.74 and a lower quartile of $3.40,” Web3 marketing firm Addressable co-founder Asaf Nadler said in a recent report posted on X. CPW, or cost per wallet, is deemed a higher “quality” metric because it tracks the cost of website visitors with a crypto wallet already installed in their browser.

Nadler previously told Cointelegraph that their analysis data showed that users with a wallet are more likely to convert to crypto products. 

CPW across different regions during the bull markets in Q1 an Q4 of 2024. Source: Asaf Nadler

Nadler said the high cost-to-return ratio of crypto gaming and gambling might be due to “higher churn, speculative behavior, and intense competition.” He added:

However, Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin said in an April 11 post on X that periods of high CPW are a good time to experiment.

“Create new games/product lines, consolidate our market share, and get ready for the next market expansion,” Zirlin said. “Know when it's a coiling phase. Know when it's time to explode,” he added.

Meanwhile, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Centralized Finance (CeFi) campaigns have it a lot easier with attracting new crypto users. “DeFi/CeFi campaigns are the most cost-efficient, with a median CPW of $2.79 and a lower quartile of just $0.10,” Nadler said.

The results are based on 200 programmatic campaigns run on Addressable by over 70 advertisers, claiming to target an estimated 9.5 million users globally.

It tracks how CPW varies across market cycles, regions, campaign strategies, and audience segments.

Nadler said that while premium markets experience low-cost conversions for existing crypto wallet holders during bull runs, attracting their attention becomes significantly more expensive during market downturns.

He highlighted that in 2024, the US and Western Europe saw CPW increase by four times and 27 times, respectively, between Q1 and Q3, as the markets continued to consolidate and interest from crypto wallet holders waned.

“While these markets provide scale and quality during bull runs, they become significantly more expensive when sentiment turns bearish, making them less sustainable during downturns,” Nadler said.

Meanwhile, emerging markets like Latin America and Eastern Europe “offer exceptionally low CPW in favorable conditions but can experience extreme cost volatility.”

 Web3 adoption struggles due to complex UIs and technical barriers. Emotional AI can redefine the user experience by providing personalized, empathetic support. 

Opinion by: Max Giammario, founder and CEO of Kindred

The interfaces and user experience in Web3 tools are terrible, even more so when compared to their Web2 counterparts. This lackluster experience for Web3 is losing the attention of as many users as desired, and with how fast the ecosystem moves, these shortcomings are rarely paid attention to.

AI agents can be an excellent tool to overcome these weaknesses. Their potential to improve development and user experience is remarkable, although it has yet to reach its real potential. Once combined with emotional AI, which will enable us to understand contexts beyond their programming, we will see a quantum leap from Web3 tools to ordinary users.

Consider your first interactions with a Web3 wallet — a scary, difficult experience. Many people fear that, at any moment, they could make a mistake, which could mean losing money. This situation can be less uncomfortable if we add agents with emotional AI that can guide new users and provide personalized support, keeping people at ease during their learning process.

If the first interaction with Web3 is seamless in this way, adoption could grow. A better user experience would be a win-win for the entire industry, which suffers from having few users. Reaching a level of adoption of a Web2 tool would be a win for the ecosystem.

With the potential that emotional AI agents have, they would facilitate the experience of new users, and they could serve as personal assistants to interact with the rest of the Web3 tools in a more autonomous, personalized way.

Emotional AI agents could act as motivational coaches, providing continuous, personalized and empathetic accompaniment that enables them to connect deeply with their users and guide them in the best practices to avoid significant losses in Web3.

These are just some of the most evaluated uses of Web3 today. The more applications it has in the future, the more potential is unlocked. Combining so much state-of-the-art technology, however, entails significant risks that must be considered in its development.

Integrating emotional AI within the Web3 ecosystem could be very beneficial. Still, it must be considered that it entails risks that any AI has, plus what the use of Web3 implies. One of the most significant risks would be using personal information because, as an emotional AI, it will require more information from its users, which increases the danger of data leakage.

This same personalization could generate an unhealthy dependence on its emotional AI partner, so safeguards against this would have to be implemented. Even being so personalized, it will generate biased information, which will close the scope of the AI agent.

Considering the risks mentioned above, while the technology is under development, by the time emotional AI agents launch, developers can forge the path to reduce these risks and implement all the benefits of this technology.

AI tools have become more widespread at a rate we have not seen since the launch of the internet. The speed of adoption is because AI tools have become straightforward tools to facilitate any task. The next step is emotional AI agents, which allow for closer AI companions who can provide better support.

As complicated as the Web3 industry is, if these emotional AI companions became the standard in the ecosystem, all these tools would be available to any user. The Web3 adoption it would facilitate would be enormous, and all this value would be worth the risks.

 Combine the reasoning power of GPTs with trading automation. Build an AI crypto bot that understands market trends and acts on your strategy. 

AI is transforming how people interact with financial markets, and cryptocurrency trading is no exception. With tools like OpenAI's Custom GPTs, it is now possible for beginners and enthusiasts to create intelligent trading bots capable of analyzing data, generating signals and even executing trades.

This guide analyzes the fundamentals of building a beginner-friendly AI crypto trading bot using Custom GPTs. It covers setup, strategy design, coding, testing and important considerations for safety and success.

A custom GPT (generative pretrained transformer) is a personalized version of OpenAI's ChatGPT. It can be trained to follow specific instructions, work with uploaded documents and assist with niche tasks, including crypto trading bot development.

These models can help automate tedious processes, generate and troubleshoot code, analyze technical indicators and even interpret crypto news or market sentiment, making them ideal companions for building algorithmic trading bots.

Before creating a trading bot, the following components are necessary:

OpenAI ChatGPT Plus subscription (for access to GPT-4 and Custom GPTs).

A crypto exchange account that offers API access (e.g., Coinbase, Binance, Kraken).

Basic knowledge of Python (or willingness to learn).

A paper trading environment to safely test strategies.

Optional: A VPS or cloud server to run the bot continuously.

Did you know? Python's creator, Guido van Rossum, named the language after Monty Python's Flying Circus, aiming for something fun and approachable.

Whether you're looking to generate trade signals, interpret news sentiment or automate strategy logic, the below step-by-step approach helps you learn the basics of combining AI with crypto trading. 

With sample Python scripts and output examples, you'll see how to connect a custom GPT to a trading system, generate trade signals and automate decisions using real-time market data.

Start by identifying a basic rule-based strategy that is easy to automate. Examples include:

Buy when Bitcoin's (BTC) daily price drops by more than 3%.

Sell when RSI (relative strength index) exceeds 70.

Enter a long position after a bullish moving average convergence divergence (MACD) crossover.

Trade based on sentiment from recent crypto headlines.

Clear, rule-based logic is essential for creating effective code and minimizing confusion for your Custom GPT.

To build a personalized GPT model:

Visit chat.openai.com

Navigate to Explore GPTs > Create

Name the model (e.g., “Crypto Trading Assistant”)

In the instructions section, define its role clearly. For example:

“You are a Python developer specialized in crypto trading bots.”

“You understand technical analysis and crypto APIs.”

“You help generate and debug trading bot code.”

Optional: Upload exchange API documentation or trading strategy PDFs for additional context.

Use the custom GPT to help generate a Python script. For example, type:

“Write a basic Python script that connects to Binance using ccxt and buys BTC when RSI drops below 30. I am a beginner and don't understand code much so I need a simple and short script please.”

The GPT can provide:

Code for connecting to the exchange via API.

Technical indicator calculations using libraries like ta or TA-lib.

Trading signal logic.

Sample buy/sell execution commands.

Python libraries commonly used for such tasks are:

ccxt for multi-exchange API support.

pandas for market data manipulation.

ta or TA-Lib for technical analysis.

schedule or apscheduler for running timed tasks.

To begin, the user must install two Python libraries: ccxt for accessing the Binance API, and ta (technical analysis) for calculating the RSI. This can be done by running the following command in a terminal:

pip install ccxt ta

Next, the user should replace the placeholder API key and secret with their actual Binance API credentials. These can be generated from a Binance account dashboard. The script uses a five-minute candlestick chart to determine short-term RSI conditions.

Below is the full script:

====================================================================

import ccxt

import pandas as pd

import ta

# Your Binance API keys (use your own)

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

api_secret = 'YOUR_API_SECRET'

# Connect to Binance

exchange = ccxt.binance({

    'apiKey': api_key,

    'secret': api_secret,

    'enableRateLimit': True,

})

# Get BTC/USDT 1h candles

bars = exchange.fetch_ohlcv('BTC/USDT', timeframe='1h', limit=100)

df = pd.DataFrame(bars, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume'])

# Calculate RSI

df['rsi'] = ta.momentum.RSIIndicator(df['close'], window=14).rsi()

# Check latest RSI value

latest_rsi = df['rsi'].iloc[-1]

print(f""Latest RSI: {latest_rsi}"")

# If RSI < 30, buy 0.001 BTC

if latest_rsi < 30:

    order = exchange.create_market_buy_order('BTC/USDT', 0.001)

    print(""Buy order placed:"", order)

else:

    print(""RSI not low enough to buy."")

====================================================================

Please note that the above script is intended for illustration purposes. It does not include risk management features, error handling or safeguards against rapid trading. Beginners should test this code in a simulated environment or on Binance's testnet before considering any use with real funds.

Also, the above code uses market orders, which execute immediately at the current price and only run once. For continuous trading, you'd put it in a loop or scheduler.

Images below show what the sample output would look like:

The sample output shows how the trading bot reacts to market conditions using the RSI indicator. When the RSI drops below 30, as seen with “Latest RSI: 27.46,” it indicates the market may be oversold, prompting the bot to place a market buy order. The order details confirm a successful trade with 0.001 BTC purchased. 

If the RSI is higher, such as “41.87,” the bot prints “RSI not low enough to buy,” meaning no trade is made. This logic helps automate entry decisions, but the script has limitations like no sell condition, no continuous monitoring and no real-time risk management features, as explained previously.

Risk control is a critical component of any automated trading strategy. Ensure your bot includes:

Stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms.

Position size limits to avoid overexposure.

Rate-limiting or cooldown periods between trades.

Capital allocation controls, such as only risking 1–2% of total capital per trade.

Prompt your GPT with instructions like:

“Add a stop-loss to the RSI trading bot at 5% below the entry price.”

Never deploy untested bots with real capital. Most exchanges offer testnets or sandbox environments where trades can be simulated safely.

Alternatives include:

Running simulations on historical data (backtesting).

Logging “paper trades” to a file instead of executing real trades.

Testing ensures that logic is sound, risk is controlled and the bot performs as expected under various conditions.

Once the bot has passed paper trading tests:

Replace test API keys: First, replace your test API keys with live API keys from your chosen exchange's account. These keys allow the bot to access your real trading account. To do this, log in to exchange, go to the API management section and create a new set of API keys. Copy the API key and secret into your script. It is crucial to handle these keys securely and avoid sharing them or including them in public code.

Set up secure API permissions (disable withdrawals): Adjust the security settings for your API keys. Make sure that only the permissions you need are enabled. For example, enable only “spot and margin trading” and disable permissions like “withdrawals” to reduce the risk of unauthorized fund transfers. Exchanges like Binance also allow you to limit API access to specific IP addresses, which adds another layer of protection.

Host the bot on a cloud server: If you want the bot to trade continuously without relying on your personal computer, you'll need to host it on a cloud server. This means running the script on a virtual machine that stays online 24/7. Services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), DigitalOcean or PythonAnywhere provide this functionality. Among these, PythonAnywhere is often the easiest to set up for beginners, as it supports running Python scripts directly in a web interface.

Still, always start small and monitor the bot regularly. Mistakes or market changes can result in losses, so careful setup and ongoing supervision are essential.

Did you know? Exposed API keys are a top cause of crypto theft. Always store them in environment variables — not inside your code.

The templates below are basic strategy ideas that beginners can easily understand. They show the core logic behind when a bot should buy, like “buy when RSI is below 30.” 

Even if you're new to coding, you can take these simple ideas and ask your Custom GPT to turn them into full, working Python scripts. GPT can help you write, explain and improve the code, so you don't need to be a developer to get started. 

In addition, here is a simple checklist for building and testing a crypto trading bot using the RSI strategy:

Just choose your trading strategy, describe what you want, and let GPT do the heavy lifting, including backtesting, live trading or multi-coin support.

RSI strategy bot (buy Low RSI)

Logic: Buy BTC when RSI drops below 30 (oversold).

if rsi < 30:

    place_buy_order()

Used for: Momentum reversal strategies.

Tools: ta library for RSI.

Logic: Buy when MACD line crosses above signal line.

if macd > signal and previous_macd < previous_signal:

    place_buy_order()

Used for: Trend-following and swing trading.

Tools: ta.trend.MACD or TA-Lib.

Logic: Use AI (Custom GPT) to scan headlines for bullish/bearish sentiment.

if “bullish” in sentiment_analysis(latest_headlines):

    place_buy_order()

Used for: Reacting to market-moving news or tweets.

Tools: News APIs + GPT sentiment classifier.

While trading bots can be powerful tools, they also come with serious risks:

Market volatility: Sudden price swings can lead to unexpected losses.

API errors or rate limits: Improper handling can cause the bot to miss trades or place incorrect orders.

Bugs in code: A single logic error can result in repeated losses or account liquidation.

Security vulnerabilities: Storing API keys insecurely can expose your funds.

Overfitting: Bots tuned to perform well in backtests may fail in live conditions.

Always start with small amounts, use strong risk management and continuously monitor bot behavior. While AI can offer powerful support, it's crucial to respect the risks involved. A successful trading bot combines intelligent strategy, responsible execution and ongoing learning.

The United States Department of Homeland Security sent an email this week informing people living in the US on a temporary legal status that their ""parole"" has been revoked and instructed them to leave the country ""immediately."" However, the email was also addressed to at least one US citizen, an immigration attorney from Massachusetts. And it remains unclear who must abide by the email's instructions—or why the apparent revocation of legal immigration status was delivered via email at all.

The email informs the recipient that “DHS is now exercising its discretion to terminate your parole,” which it says will go into effect “7 days from the date of this notice.” The email appears to be similar, if not identical, to messages received by users of CBP One, an app developed during the Biden administration that allows non-citizens from certain countries to schedule appointments at US points of entry in an effort to seek asylum. A spokesperson for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tells WIRED, however, that the email was sent more broadly.

“CBP has issued notices terminating parole for individuals who do not have lawful status to remain,” says CBP assistant commissioner for public affairs Hilton Beckham. “This process is not limited to CBP One users and does not currently apply to those paroled under programs such as U4U and OAW.”

U4U refers to Uniting for Ukraine, a program launched under the Biden administration to allow for expedited immigration to the US for Ukrainians fleeing Russia's war against its neighboring country. Former President Joe Biden began OAW, or Operation Allies Welcome, in 2021 following the US military's exit from Afghanistan to allow for the safe resettling of “vulnerable Afghans, including those who worked alongside us in Afghanistan for the past two decades,” according to DHS.

The email itself does not identify these or any other exemptions, nor does it make clear to whom it applies beyond the recipient. Beckham also confirmed that the email was sent to whatever email address the agency had associated with the intended target, leading to confusion for at least one immigration attorney.

“Some personal news: the Department of Homeland Security has given me, an immigration lawyer born in Newton, Massachusetts, seven days to leave the US,” wrote Nicole Micheroni, a partner at  Cameron Micheroni & Silvia LLC, in a post on Bluesky on Friday night. “Does anyone know if you can get Italian citizenship through great-grandparents?”

Micheroni tells WIRED that she first thought the email was intended for one of her clients, but she quickly noticed that it was only addressed to her.

“I don't feel like I'm actually going to be deported in seven days, but it's concerning that this is the level of care they're using to send these out,” Micheroni says. She adds that it's possible that the DHS email was “intended for one of my clients or somebody else,” as it's not uncommon for immigrants in the US to list their attorneys as the point of contact.

The Trump administration has sought to revoke the parole of some 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who entered the US under a Biden-era humanitarian parole program. While it moved to subject them to expedited deportation effective April 24, on Thursday a federal judge in Boston said she would issue a protective order blocking that attempt. The order may complicate the instructions in the email, which stipulates that it does not apply to people who “have otherwise obtained a lawful basis to remain” in the US.

CBP's Beckham did not immediately respond to WIRED's questions about whether the court order would impact any recipients of the email.

Attorney Lauren Regan, founder and executive director of the nonprofit Civil Liberties Defense Center, tells WIRED that the lack of clarity about whether the revocation of temporary parole applies to the recipient of the email is likely causing fear and confusion among many immigrants, especially those without access to adequate legal guidance.

“So many people don't have a lawyer, or their lawyer has 6,000 clients,” Regan says, which “completely overloads” the attorneys who often provide pro bono legal services to immigrants.

“A lot of people that are here on parole status don't know the nuances of immigration law, so they get this email and they don't know if it applies to them,” Micheroni says. “And most of them assume that it does because everything is really scary for people right now.”

It's also unclear whether the email is related to recent efforts by Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In an April 10 post on X, DOGE claimed that “CBP identified a subset of 6.3k individuals paroled into the United States since 2023 on the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center watchlist or with criminal records. These paroles have since been terminated with immediate effect.”

Beckham did not immediately respond to questions about whether the email was intended for these 6,300 individuals, nor did she answer WIRED's questions about how many people received the email.

Then there's the matter of the email being an email at all, Regan says, adding that “it is absolutely not common” for a change in legal immigration status to arrive via email, which typically happens in person or via certified mail. “People would think it's a phishing email or something not legitimate,” Regan says. Also, the fact that the email does not appear to have been first posted on a government website added to questions about its authenticity.

“Normally if the government is going to change a practice, they would first do it on their websites,” Regan says, adding, “but the fact that this was not on the website first and then sent out as a direct communication is very, very unusual.”

Regan also notes that many immigrants do not have email addresses, and therefore couldn't receive the communication in the first place.

Even for Micheroni, a US citizen and immigration attorney, the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement practices have made life less stable. The email only made matters worse.

“I have gotten some serious inquiries from my parents or other family members or friends being like, ‘what do I do if you stop answering me or if you disappear? Like, who do you want me to call?'” she says.

“And if people in my life are feeling this way, and this is what I do, I know a lot about it,” Micheroni adds. “I can't imagine what it's like for people that don't fully understand immigration law.”

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

Large language models work well because they're so large. The latest models from OpenAI, Meta, and DeepSeek use hundreds of billions of “parameters”—the adjustable knobs that determine connections among data and get tweaked during the training process. With more parameters, the models are better able to identify patterns and connections, which in turn makes them more powerful and accurate.

But this power comes at a cost. Training a model with hundreds of billions of parameters takes huge computational resources. To train its Gemini 1.0 Ultra model, for example, Google reportedly spent $191 million. Large language models (LLMs) also require considerable computational power each time they answer a request, which makes them notorious energy hogs. A single query to ChatGPT consumes about 10 times as much energy as a single Google search, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.

In response, some researchers are now thinking small. IBM, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI have all recently released small language models (SLMs) that use a few billion parameters—a fraction of their LLM counterparts.

Small models are not used as general-purpose tools like their larger cousins. But they can excel on specific, more narrowly defined tasks, such as summarizing conversations, answering patient questions as a health care chatbot, and gathering data in smart devices. “For a lot of tasks, an 8 billion–parameter model is actually pretty good,” said Zico Kolter, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. They can also run on a laptop or cell phone, instead of a huge data center. (There's no consensus on the exact definition of “small,” but the new models all max out around 10 billion parameters.)

To optimize the training process for these small models, researchers use a few tricks. Large models often scrape raw training data from the internet, and this data can be disorganized, messy, and hard to process. But these large models can then generate a high-quality data set that can be used to train a small model. The approach, called knowledge distillation, gets the larger model to effectively pass on its training, like a teacher giving lessons to a student. “The reason [SLMs] get so good with such small models and such little data is that they use high-quality data instead of the messy stuff,” Kolter said.

Researchers have also explored ways to create small models by starting with large ones and trimming them down. One method, known as pruning, entails removing unnecessary or inefficient parts of a neural network—the sprawling web of connected data points that underlies a large model.

Pruning was inspired by a real-life neural network, the human brain, which gains efficiency by snipping connections between synapses as a person ages. Today's pruning approaches trace back to a 1989 paper in which the computer scientist Yann LeCun, now at Meta, argued that up to 90 percent of the parameters in a trained neural network could be removed without sacrificing efficiency. He called the method “optimal brain damage.” Pruning can help researchers fine-tune a small language model for a particular task or environment.

For researchers interested in how language models do the things they do, smaller models offer an inexpensive way to test novel ideas. And because they have fewer parameters than large models, their reasoning might be more transparent. “If you want to make a new model, you need to try things,” said Leshem Choshen, a research scientist at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. “Small models allow researchers to experiment with lower stakes.”

The big, expensive models, with their ever-increasing parameters, will remain useful for applications like generalized chatbots, image generators, and drug discovery. But for many users, a small, targeted model will work just as well, while being easier for researchers to train and build. “These efficient models can save money, time, and compute,” Choshen said.

I will preface this review by saying that I love salads. I've been reviewing plant-based meal kits and vegan meal delivery services for the better part of this year, and I've learned that man (in this case, me) cannot live on reheated frozen foods alone. I ache for a fresh element—a crunch of a root vegetable, a ping of citrus. Enter Thistle: a gluten-free, single-serving vegan meal delivery service that focuses on fresh produce with varied cuisines using additive-free vegan ingredients.

Thistle offers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, and you can customize how many of each meal you want to be delivered per week, with two delivery days available. (You can change, pause, or cancel your subscription any time.) Meals are single servings, so this meal plan is best for those eating alone. Thistle's meal plans are only available in East and West Coast cities and Chicago right now (you can enter your ZIP code to see if your area is covered), and change depending on week and location, with certain jarred salads, soups, juices, and shots available every week. All of Thistle's standard meals are vegan, gluten- and additive-free, but there's an optional add-on for sustainable meats for certain dinners and lunches at an additional $3 per meal.

Meals mostly follow the same formula: preprepared with no cooking required. Those that do require prep just need a quick flash in a pan to get the flavors juicin' together. Breakfasts were simple: a gluten-free pastry or oatmeal with a fresh fruit element; once a stand-out granola-smoothie bowl. The salads were my favorite—they focused on various textures to really make the individual ingredients pop, and always had tasty, bright dressings. Thistle's more hearty dinner choices, like the chimichurri pasta bowl, only needed to be sautéed in a pan for a few minutes, but were better the next day when all the flavors had set together.

Thistle has a new, curated menu each week, but you can always make edits to suit your taste. Because I wanted to be a completely unbiased tester, I went with Thistle's premade menu, which was mostly a mix of gluten-free, fruit-focused breakfasts; inventive, fresh salads; and mostly preprepared bean- and pasta-forward veggie dinners. You can select your preferences during signup, but Thistle accommodates soy, tree nut, coconut, peanut, fish, shellfish, and pork allergies.

As previously mentioned, Thistle is great for those with dietary restrictions—all meals already don't contain dairy, eggs, gluten, refined white sugars, artificial sweeteners, artificial preservatives, additives, or dyes. See? It's a “crunchy” choice, while still being tasty enough that the average health-oriented person—vegan or not—will most likely find something they like. That is, emphasis on average: My Hamburger Helper-eating Missouri born-and-bred uncle may not have the same raves about these meals as I do.

Like most meal delivery kits and subscription services, especially those with special dietary requirements or anything slapped with a vegan label, the meal packages are pretty pricey. The meals in this kit are more than I ever spend on weekly groceries: breakfasts start at $13, with lunches and dinners at $16, but they go down in price as you order more meals. All snacks are $7.50. At the time of writing, Thistle is offering 40 percent off first orders, which made my order of three breakfasts, lunches, and dinners (with no snacks) go from $122 to $73, which is a pretty solid deal at around $8 per meal.

Unlike a true meal kit, Thistle doesn't come with ingredients and meal cards. Once the meals arrive, all you need to do is find space in the fridge—or grab a fork and pop open the container. The meals are delivered in a reusable, insulated bag with recyclable ice packs that you set out with each new delivery to reuse in future orders and cut down on waste. Each meal is already prepared in a simple plastic container, with nutrition facts and ingredients on the label. Many of the meals could be eaten chilled (as is) straight from the fridge, but if you opt to reheat, the directions were simply to heat “in a skillet for 2-3 minutes or until desired temperature.” In this regard, Thistle would be perfect for people who want to eat raw and plant-based but don't want to do any of the work.

The meals are pretty nutritionally balanced. Lunches and dinners are generally 400 to 550 calories, with 20 grams of protein or more and around 15 grams of fiber. Breakfasts are more like snacks and are 250 to 400 calories, with at least 10 grams of plant-based protein and around 10 grams of fiber. All of the lunch and dinner meals were surprisingly filling for being so vegetable-focused.

My favorite meals focused on multiple textures and various ingredients to make a truly dynamic salad-type dish. The Corn and Poblano Chile Salad With Adobo Pinto Beans was a solid, Mexican-inspired meal that was the perfect lunch to eat on the first warm spring day of the year. Roasted poblano peppers, sweet corn, cabbage, brown rice, and pinto beans worked well together with the mild spinach backdrop and a roasted jalapeno vegan ranch dressing that I could've drank straight from the ramekin.

I still dream of the Lemongrass Shirataki Bowl, a cold noodle salad dish that hit all the right elements of savory-spice and varied texture. The chilled rice noodles came with a lightly spicy marinated mince of sautéed vegetables and pea protein crumbles. The crisp cucumber, spinach, ginger, lemongrass, and peanuts added a crunchy texture, but the yummy salty, slightly tangy housemade vegan “fish” sauce truly brought this all together. This sauce used dynamic ingredients like coconut aminos, date syrup, rice vinegar, lime juice, tahini, mushrooms, and seaweed to get that same great super-umami flavor of fish sauce but without the suffering. Sigh, I wish I could eat it again.

I'm not a breakfast person, so Thistle's small, fruit-forward choices were perfect for me. A dense, dry polenta almond cake was saved by a bright, sweet raspberry chia jam. A smoothie bowl with blackberry and hibiscus topped with crunchy coconut granola was the perfect start to my day. The Super Seed & Berry Muesli overnight oat dish had good texture variety, and its bright-blue coconut and vanilla spirulina “mylk” was a fun addition, although I wish it had a little more fruit to add a fresh element.

The heated dinner meals were good but didn't feel as complex as the hearty salads. A chimichurri sauce was the stand-out on an otherwise one-note pasta dish with beans, artichoke, spinach, and sun-dried tomatoes. A Latin-inspired black bean, spinach, rice, and plantain dish needed more acid or spice to liven it up. Other snacks, like a charcuterie-type plate, fell a little flat with veggies that were beginning to dry out and a funky vegan cheese with a grainy texture. (Later that night though, I had Thistle's vegan take on cheesecake with a tahini tres leches mousse that was perhaps the best vegan dessert I've ever had, so all was—pretty much—forgiven.)

Besides the high price point—except for right now with 40 percent off (seriously, if you've been curious about this meal kit, I'd recommend you try while it's heavily discounted)—I don't have many gripes with Thistle.

When you sign up for a plan, you receive texts with updates on your delivery and they notify you when the delivery has been dropped off. I got the text notification that it was dropped off Sunday night, but when I checked nothing was delivered. The next day, I found out the delivery person ended up dropping it off at my neighbor's instead. I had to wait a whole week, until the next Sunday, to get another delivery. It was a bummer because I had to last-minute grocery shop for the week ahead on a busy Sunday night, which I hadn't budgeted for—time- or moneywise. In the future, I may opt to meet the delivery person face-to-face so I can guarantee I'll be fed that week.

All of the meals come in plastic containers, which can be very tricky with recycling. If you opt for this service, I'd make sure to check your local guidelines for which plastics are accepted and recycled. Where I live, they are much more lax with plastic recycling requirements, so I rinsed all of my containers and said a prayer to Mother Gaia that they would be recycled and not end up in a landfill for the rest of time. Most of the jars with twist lids were solid enough that they could be washed and reused.

I loved these tasty, low-to-no-prep healthy vegan meals, but I don't know if I could only eat them for weeks on end. I'm a natural-born cook. I would miss the ritual of chopping, adding spices, and sautéeing. But I most likely will be supplementing my regular meals with some of these dynamic, hearty salads for a quick, healthy lunch.

I love thinking about chicken. Specifically, I like thinking about how to cook chicken well. I can trace a line from my Mom's famous sour cream chicken with chives and paprika, to Cook's Illustrated's “easy roast chicken” in its original The Best Recipe, and on to Simon Hopkinson's Roast Chicken and Other Stories, with hundreds of other stops along the way.

At home, I love roasting a whole chicken, an art form where, if you do it right, you're rewarded with a dark, crispy skin, delicious leg quarters, and tender breast meat. It's a balancing act, though. Breasts need to hit an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, but legs and thighs are better when cooked to a higher temperature. It's not like you're cooking a perfectly round, fairly-homogenous, inch-thick hamburger, either. Chickens are … you know … chicken shaped, with different thicknesses, densities, and parts that poke out.

Roast a chicken breast and it will cook pretty quickly and be ready to pull out of the oven a bit under 165°F, which will allow it to coast to a finish without overcooking, something known as “carryover cooking.” Thighs, on the other hand, are much more forgiving and become fall-off-the-bone tender with a longer cooking time and if they're cooked to a higher internal temperature, which turns cooking the whole thing into a puzzle.

By tweaking variables, like the oven position, cooking time, and cooking temperature, you can set it on the right flight path for all the parts to glide into doneness at the same time.

Way back in 1999, Cook's Illustrated cooked 14 chickens at different temperatures (or temperature combinations) for that “easy roast chicken” recipe and came up with a pan-roasting method that starts at 375 degrees and finishes at 450. As a budding technique nerd, I was entranced.

Today, it's surprisingly hard to find a serious cookbook that cooks a whole bird in what you might call the traditional method. They now favor spatchcocking, where you cut out the backbone and lay the bird flat with the skin side up, which allows the leg quarters (drumsticks and thighs) to cook to a higher temperature while keeping the breasts from overcooking. Chef-author Hugh Acheson is a proponent of coating the bird with baking powder for deep and even browning.

Taking extra steps like these might sound fussy, but it can also be a lot of fun. Try it one way one day and another the next and see what you like. If you're following a tested recipe, dinner will likely turn out great. Over time, you'll develop favorites.

The PoulTree attaches to a pan so you can “levitate” a chicken over it.

If that tinkering vibe is your jam, I have a new unique new tool for you to play with, a stout metal rod called the PoulTree with a series of bends along its length allow you to attach it to the handle of a Lodge cast-iron skillet. This allows it to hold a chicken several inches over the surface of the pan.

(Side note: While the PoulTree is a solid, well thought-out item, website photos are almost universally, comically bad. They're a tiny operation, and at this point more of a labor of love than a full-grown business. Try to cut 'em some some slack.)

I bought a nice chicken, sprinkled it with salt inside and out, aka a “dry brine,” and let it air dry overnight in the fridge. These two steps help keep the bird moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.

The PoulTree team suggests cooking on a hot grill, so I started there, or at least as close as I could. I cranked my Weber grill, hung the bird on the rod over the pan, sprayed it with duck fat to get the party started, inserted a surprisingly fiddly ThermoWorks RFX cordless probe in the breast, then set the whole shebang on the grates and shut the lid.

One particularly fun part about this thing is that's pretty much all you need to do until it's done. Monitor the temperature and pull it out when it gets where you want it to go. I could not resist peeking once or twice, when I watched the drippings and Seattle raindrops vaporize on the pan surface.

Per the manufacturer's personal suggestion, I pulled it when the breast hit 148 degrees, put but it on a cutting board and let it coast right to 165 degrees, at which point the drumstick got up to 188 degrees. This was pretty ideal for both parts. I carved it and got out my notebook. The drumstick and breast meat approached perfection, with great texture and crispy skin. The breast even had a bit of that griller's grail know as “the jiggle.” The skin ranged between crisp (good!) and a little leathery (fine, not great). The thighs, perhaps, due to their position between the drumsticks and the body, were less perfect than the drumsticks, but still quite good.

I liked cooking with it! I wondered how I might change things the next round, and I kind of marveled at the simplicity of the thing and how it cooked with do-it-on-a-weeknight speed. Interestingly, it got me thinking about how heat and and technique affect cooking.

I also realized a safety item to keep in mind. Before it's time to take it off the heat, figure out how you're going to get the chicken from your grill to your kitchen and where you're going to set it down. You can't really remove the bird from the rod when it's over the grill, and you don't want to walk far at all holding a heavy and still screaming-hot skillet with a chicken attached to it either. I thought about what could've happened if it started burning my hand while I was walking down the stairs from my deck to my kitchen with nowhere to set it down. You also don't want to melt your countertop or scorch up your cutting board. I ended up transfering it on a sheet pan on my grill's (metal!) side table, then walked that down to the kitchen and set it on top of my stove.

A few days later, bird number two was not the smashing success that its predecessor was, mostly because I didn't account for the effects of the weather. On this cooler, wetter day, the grill simply didn't get as hot, meaning that pulling it at 148 degrees didn't carry over as much as I wanted it to by the end of the resting period. I carved the chicken and put the less-done parts in the oven to finish. Not a big deal, an easy-to-fix user error, and being a decently cooked chicken slathered with za'atar, it was still great. The $19 PoulTree offers a $60 ""roaster"" option, where you buy it with a Lodge pan with the idea that that's all you use the pan for, and considering how scuzzy the pans get during cooking, it's a pretty good idea.

A third bird, this one with no overnight brining or air-drying, simply coated in amba (see the cookbook Zahav Home for more on that goodness) and put on the grill was an unqualified weeknight success. Not a brined and marinated wonder, but still very good.

I was in Oaxaca City for the next round, where I bought a chicken from Pollos José (no relation) in the Merced market. For “not lugging a heavy skillet around in my baggage” purposes, I just brought a rod and a device PoulTree calls a “Double Coupe” that allows you to use the rod over a sheet pan. I cooked the chicken over potato wedges and while the sheet pan and spuds definitely did not help the chicken skin crisp up, the schmaltz-roasted spuds were well worth the trade-off.

If you cook the chicken over an empty pan—PoulTree's preferred method—in too hot an oven, it can really turn into a smoke show, so you've got some thinking to do. My chef-pal and regular review helper Hamid Salimian got the willies thinking about cooking it in a hot oven, suggesting brining, then air-drying it before cooking it in a (not-too-hot) 350-degree oven with some veggies underneath. He also suggested marinating it with chilies for caramelization and flavor and trying to cook it breast side up.

Chef Chris Young of Modernist Cuisine and Combustion—a better wireless thermometer than the RFX, IMO—fame also weighed in. He seemed to appreciate how the PoulTree lifts the bird away from the cooking surface, a category that along with rotisserie chickens he refers to as “levitating birds,” that allow the whole thing to get uniformly dark on the outside. Putting veggies in the pan, he posited, creates steam close to the underside of the chicken, and that part of the skin won't get as nice and crisp as the rest of the chicken.

For both chefs, I got the sense that they might be enjoying thinking about this new way to cook a classic, how they might approach it, and what the final outcome would be. (I hope they did, anyway. At the very least, I was having fun.)

This might've been my favorite thing about the PoulTree. It asks you to think about your desired end result and how to achieve it. It encourages tinkering, and, as a bonus, it cooks fast and easy. If you're into chicken and general kitchen nerdery, trying it out is a fun and inexpensive way to tinker. You can make a speedy weeknight chicken with satisfying results, or be rewarded for putting a little extra care into it. If you throw some veggies in the pan, it's worth the sacrifice.

“This will make things a bit steamier in the oven than a bare pan, but at least the smoke alarm won't be going off,” Young says. “Personally, I think you want something like potatoes, that benefit from the drippings … For me, nothing beats potatoes soaking up the drippings from a levitating bird.”

The tech industry may not be safe from new tariffs, according to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

The Trump administration announced Friday evening that consumer electronics such as laptops and smartphones would be exempt from the tariffs it unveiled earlier this month. (While Trump delayed many of those tariffs this week, he left a 10% baseline tariff in place, and also levied an additional 125% tariff on Chinese goods.)

Reports about the exemptions noted that tech products might still be affected by targeted tariffs to come, with semiconductors coming under particular scrutiny.

Lutnick made that more explicit on Sunday morning during an interview with the ABC show “This Week,” saying that Trump is making these products “exempt from the reciprocal tariffs” but including them in “the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.”

“All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,” Lutnick said. “We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels — we need to have these things made in America.”

Pressed on whether tariffs will mean higher prices for American consumers, Lutnick said, “I don't think so,” and again emphasized, “I think the idea is that we can manufacture in America.” (Others have said Lutnick's vision that “the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,” is a fantasy.)

Trump himself was asked about semiconductor tariffs this weekend, and he said, “I'll give you that answer Monday.”

In a quiet transformation from merchandising giant to (also) healthcare giant, Amazon may be positioning its sprawling logistics network and growing medical footprint to potentially save lives, starting with your front door.

According to Bloomberg, back in 2023, Amazon piloted a several months-long pilot program called Project Pulse, equipping delivery vans with defibrillators and training drivers in CPR. In cities like London, Amsterdam, and Bologna, more than 100 drivers participated, with several of them receiving alerts from citizen responder apps and arriving on site. (Rescue services were reportedly already treating the victims.) 

The company hasn't moved forward, but it is “evaluating the feedback and exploring additional opportunities for future programs,” an Amazon spokesperson tells Bloomberg.

It'd likely a public relations win for the company. It would also be a way to expand Amazon's healthcare ambitions beyond One Medical, the primary care provider for which it shelled out $3.9 billion in early 2023. 

With rivals like Walgreens and Walmart retreating from primary care — Walmart shuttered its primary healthcare business in April of last year, closing 51 locations, and Walgreens is being taken private again by Sycamore Partners for just $10 billion — Amazon could be feeling increasingly confident it can do what the others couldn't: reshape healthcare delivery and bring more than just packages to customers' doorsteps.

The Linux Foundation has become something of a misnomer through the years. It has extended far beyond its roots as the steward of the Linux kernel, emerging as a sprawling umbrella outfit for a thousand open source projects spanning cloud infrastructure, security, digital wallets, enterprise search, fintech, maps, and more.

Last month, the OpenInfra Foundation — best known for OpenStack — became the latest addition to its stable, further cementing the Linux Foundation's status as a “foundation of foundations.”

The Linux Foundation emerged in 2007 from the amalgamation of two Linux-focused not-for-profits: the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL) and the Free Standards Group (FSG). With founding members such as IBM, Intel, and Oracle, the Foundation's raison d'être was challenging the “closed” platforms of that time — which basically meant doubling down on Linux in response to Windows' domination.

“Computing is entering a world dominated by two platforms: Linux and Windows,” the Linux Foundation's executive director, Jim Zemlin (pictured above), said at the time. “While being managed under one roof has given Windows some consistency, Linux offers freedom of choice, customization and flexibility without forcing customers into vendor lock-in.”

Zemlin has led the charge at the Linux Foundation for some two decades, overseeing its transition through technological waves such as mobile, cloud, and — more recently — artificial intelligence. Its evolution from Linux-centricity to covering just about every technological nook is reflective of how technology itself doesn't stand still — it evolves and, more importantly, it intersects.

“Technology goes up and down — we're not using iPods or floppy disks anymore,” Zemlin explained to TechCrunch in an interview during KubeCon in London last week. “What I realized early on was that if the Linux Foundation were to become an enduring body for collective software development, we needed to be able to bet on many different forms of technology.”

This is what Zemlin refers to as a “portfolio approach,” similar to how a company diversifies so it's not dependent on the success of a single product. Combining multiple critical projects under a single organization enables the Foundation to benefit from vertical-specific expertise in networking or automotive-grade Linux, for example, while tapping broader expertise in copyright, patents, data privacy, cybersecurity, marketing, and event organization.

Being able to pool such resources across projects is more important than ever, as businesses contend with a growing array of regulations such as the EU AI Act and Cyber Resilience Act. Rather than each individual project having to fight the good fight alone, they have the support of a corporate-like foundation backed by some of the world's biggest companies. 

“At the Linux Foundation, we have specialists who work in vertical industry efforts, but they're not lawyers or copyright experts or patent experts. They're also not experts in running large-scale events, or in developer training,” Zemlin said. “And so that's why the collective investment is important. We can create technology in an agile way through technical leadership at the project level, but then across all the projects have a set of tools that create long-term sustainability for all of them collectively.”

The coming together of the Linux Foundation and OpenInfra Foundation last month underscored this very point. OpenStack, for the uninitiated, is an open source, open standards-based cloud computing platform that emerged from a joint project between Rackspace and NASA in 2010. It transitioned to an eponymous foundation in 2012, before rebranding as the OpenInfra Foundation after outgrowing its initial focus on OpenStack.

Zemlin had known Jonathan Bryce, OpenInfra Foundation CEO and one of the original OpenStack creators, for years. The two foundations had already collaborated on shared initiatives, such as the Open Infrastructure Blueprint whitepaper.

“We realized that together we could deal with some of the challenges that we're seeing now around regulatory compliance, cybersecurity risk, legal challenges around open source — because it [open source] has become so pervasive,” Zemlin said.

For the Linux Foundation, the merger also brought an experienced technical lead into the fold, someone who had worked in industry and built a product used by some of the world's biggest organizations.

“It is very hard to hire people to lead technical collaboration efforts, who have technical knowledge and understanding, who understand how to grow an ecosystem, who know how to run a business, and possess a level of humility that allows them to manage a super broad base of people without inserting their own ego in,” Zemlin said. “That ability to lead through influence — there's not a lot of people who have that skill.”

This portfolio approach extends beyond individual projects and foundations, and into a growing array of stand-alone regional entities. The most recent offshoot was LF India, which launched just a few months ago, but the Linux Foundation introduced a Japanese entity some years ago, while in 2022 it launched a European branch to support a growing regulatory and digital sovereignty agenda across the bloc.

The Linux Foundation Europe, which houses a handful of projects such as The Open Wallet Foundation, allows European members to collaborate with one another in isolation, while also gaining reciprocal membership for the broader Linux Foundation global outfit.

“There are times where, in the name of digital sovereignty, people want to collaborate with other EU organizations, or a government wants to sponsor or endow a particular effort, and you need to have only EU organizations participate in that,” Zemlin said. “This [Linux Foundation Europe] allows us to thread the needle on two things — they can work locally and have digital sovereignty, but they're not throwing out the global participation that makes open source so good.”

While AI is inarguably a major step-change both for the technology realm and society, it has also pushed the concept of “open source” into the mainstream arena in ways that traditional software hasn't — with controversy in hot pursuit. 

Meta, for instance, has positioned its Llama brand of AI models as open source, even though they decidedly are not by most estimations. This has also highlighted some of the challenges of creating a definition of open source AI that everyone is happy with, and we're now seeing AI models with a spectrum of “openness” in terms of access to code, datasets, and commercial restrictions.

The Linux Foundation, already home to the LF AI & Data Foundation, which houses some 75 projects, last year published the Model Openness Framework (MOF), designed to bring a more nuanced approach to the definition of open source AI. The Open Source Initiative (OSI), stewards of the “open source definition,” used this framework in its own open source AI definition.

“Most models lack the necessary components for full understanding, auditing, and reproducibility, and some model producers use restrictive licenses whilst claiming that their models are ‘open source,'” the MOF paper authors wrote at the time.

And so the MOF serves a three-tiered classification system that rates models on their “completeness and openness,” with regards to code, data, model parameters, and documentation.

It's basically a handy way to establish how “open” a model really is by assessing which components are public, and under what licenses. Just because a model isn't strictly “open source” by one definition doesn't mean that it isn't open enough to help develop safety tools that reduce hallucinations, for example — and Zemlin says it's important to address these distinctions.

“I talk to a lot of people in the AI community, and it's a much broader set of technology practitioners [compared to traditional software engineering],” Zemlin said. “What they tell me is that they understand the importance of open source meaning ‘something' and the importance of open source as a definition. Where they get frustrated is being a little too pedantic at every layer. What they want is predictability and transparency and understanding of what they're actually getting and using.”

Chinese AI darling DeepSeek has also played a big part in the open source AI conversation, emerging with performant, efficient open source models that upended how the incumbent proprietary players such as OpenAI plan to release their own models in the future. 

But all this, according to Zemlin, is just another “moment” for open source.

“I think it's good that people recognize just how valuable open source is in developing any modern technology,” he said. “But open source has these moments — Linux was a moment for open source, where the open source community could produce a better operating system for cloud computing and enterprise computing and telecommunications than the biggest proprietary software company in the world. AI is having that moment right now, and DeepSeek is a big part of that.”

A quick peek across the Linux Foundation's array of projects reveals two broad categories: those it has acquired, as with the OpenInfra Foundation, and those it has created from within, as it has done with the likes of the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF).

While acquiring an existing project or foundation might be easier, starting a new project from scratch is arguably more important, as it's striving to fulfill a need that is at least partially unmet. And this is where Zemlin says there is an “art and science” to succeeding.

“The science is that you have to create value for the developers in these communities that are creating the artifact, the open source code that everybody wants — that's where all the value comes from,” Zemlin said. “The art is trying to figure out where there's a new opportunity for open source to have a big impact on an industry.”

This is why Zemlin refers to what the Linux Foundation is doing as something akin to a “reverse venture capitalist” approach. A VC looks for product-market fit, and entrepreneurs they want to work with — all in the name of making money. 

“Instead, we look for ‘project-market' fit — is this technology going to have a big impact on a specific industry? Can we bring the right team of developers and leaders together to make it happen? Is that market big enough? Is the technology impactful?” Zemlin said. “But instead of making a ton of money like a VC, we give it all away.”

But however its vast array of projects came to fruition, there's no ignoring the elephant in the room: The Linux Foundation is no longer all about Linux, and it hasn't been for a long time. So should we ever expect a rebrand into something a little more prosaic, but encompassing — like the Open Technology Foundation?

Don't hold your breath. 

“When I wear Linux Foundation swag into a coffee shop, somebody will often say, ‘I love Linux' or ‘I used Linux in college,'” Zemlin said. “It's a powerful household brand, and it's pretty hard to move away from that. Linux itself is such a positive idea, it's so emblematic of truly impactful and successful ‘open source.'”

A planet that stretches and contracts in orbit also wobbles, which does something similar to its orbit. Loss of speed often results in lowered orbit, and thus more wobbling, in a feedback loop.

On Saturday, the Trump administration rolled out a big exception to its across-the-board tariffs on electronics, such as computers and smartphones. The move spares Apple from major price hikes on a wide majority of its products and is a little relief for consumers and tech companies.

In response, Amazon saw its chance to lower prices on the newly released 11th-generation iPad, which was released just a month ago in March. At $328 down from $349 for the 128GB Wi-Fi model, this is the best deals you'll find on Apple's latest tablet (it costs almost the same as the previous iPad 10 which is available for $319) which makes it a must-buy if you're looking for premium tech at a reasonable price point.

See at Amazon

The 11th-generation iPad is a major leap for Apple's tablet line. It provides instant performance with the latest A16 chip and it is capable of handling everything from gaming to multitasking effortlessly. This chip was previously reserved for Apple's high-end line and ensures the iPad performs effortlessly regardless of the app. From photo editing, video streaming, or multiple apps open simultaneously, the A16 chip provides unparalleled speed and efficiency. It is so much better than the A14 chip from the previous iPad 10.

The 11-inch Liquid Retina display of the iPad is another highlight, and this is why people also love Apple tactile tablets. With colors that pop and razor-sharp definition, it's ideal for watching movies, surfing the web or editing creative work. Basically, it can replace a laptop. The screen also features True Tone technology which changes the color temperature of the screen to match your environment for a more enjoyable viewing experience.

Storage is not an issue with this discounted model either as it has 128GB of internal storage (256GB and 512GB models are not on sale) and provides more than enough space for apps, photos, videos, and documents. For most users, the capacity of this much is well balanced between cost and usability. Additionally, the iPad is Wi-Fi 6 compatible for faster and more reliable internet access.

One of the most useful aspects of the new iPad is its all-day battery. Apple is guaranteeing as much as 10 hours of use on a single charge, which is ideal for long days at the office or on the road. The device also supports fast charging via USB-C so you can quickly top off your battery when you need to. It also supports accessories such as the Apple Pencil (2nd generation) and Magic Keyboard, turning it into an effective note-taking or productivity tool.

At a mere $319 (reduced from its initial price of $349), this is an 8% discount on one of Apple's new releases. The savings do not appear significant in contrast with the discounts applicable to earlier models or refurbished products, but this is a very new product being offered at this price level so shortly after release. Amazon's bold pricing approach ensures that this is an unbeatable deal, despite the tariffs hike.

The market is filled with literally hundreds of headphones available and it's difficult not to feel somewhat… overwhelmed. With top brands such as Beats, Bose, Sonos, Apple, or Sony often costing $200 or more, you can't help but ask yourself if it's truly worth spending that type of money. The good news? It's not.

This is where the JBL Tune 510BT comes in, a Bluetooth wireless headphone that provides unbelievable value at a price that's hard to believe. At less than 20$ down from $50 (60% off the original price), this is a bargain of a deal with features and sound that competing products 10 to 20 times its price can't compete with.

See at Amazon

Now reduced to its lowest price ever of $19.99, the JBL Tune 510BT is a limited-time offer available on Amazon that you really won't want to miss. Even last year, during the Black Friday deals, these headphones were selling for $25, so this offer is even tastier. With over 10,000 units sold just last month alone, the JBL Tune 510BT has earned itself a spot in the Top 5 best-sellers in Amazon's prestigious Electronics category.

The JBL Tune 510BT has the signature JBL Pure Bass sound which is featured in some of the world's most famous arenas. This enables you to hear rich, deep bass and clear audio which is perfect for losing yourself in your favorite podcasts or music. The headphones are (obviously) wireless and Bluetooth streams audio from your device seamlessly. They can even switch between two devices so that you don't miss a call.

One of the features we absolutely love about the JBL Tune 510BT is the extended battery life which gives you up to 40 hours of continuous playback (probably the industry record). This means that you can listen to your music all day long without needing to recharge. And when you do need to top up, the Speed Charge feature allows you to replenish the battery in only 2 hours with the convenient Type-C USB cable. What's more, a 5-minute quick charge gives you an additional 2 hours of music.

The headphones also feature a microphone on the ear cup which allows you to answer and manage calls hands-free with ease. The simple buttons on the ear cup allow you to manage your audio as well as manage your calls without needing to reach for your phone. Furthermore, with the multi-function button, you can access Siri or Google Assistant with a single press.

On the compatibility side, these headphones support both Android and iOS devices, meaning no matter what smartphone you carry, you can enjoy your music with ease. For $19.99, it's a deal you shouldn't miss. Make sure you get yours before it runs out of stock.

The robot vacuum market is saturated with options which vary in a wide range of prices from $300 to… $1,500, It is now more difficult than ever to find the right model. However, one device currently stands out (on Amazon) as the de facto choice if you're looking for high-end features without the premium tag: the Dreame L10s Ultra robot vacuum and mop combo.

What's truly amazing about this model is that it's now going for $299, which is an all-time low that even surpasses its Black Friday offer of $399. That's a huge 62% off its standard 2025 price of $789, which makes it an absolute bargain if you're looking for a great robot vacuum.

See at Amazon

The Dreame L10s Ultra is more than just a robot vacuum: It is a complete cleaning system with automation at its heart to simplify the cleaning of all your floors. The docking station with its multi-functionality is a game-changer and handles automatic dust collection, washing and drying of the mop, water refilling, and even the addition of cleaning solution. The dock empties the vacuum's dustbin cleanly into a 3-liter dust bag and allows for up to 60 days of hands-free cleaning. After every cleaning, the mops are immersed in water and high-speed spun against the grooves of the base station to get rid of dirt.

At the core of the Dreame L10s Ultra is its 5300Pa suction power that guarantees strong vacuuming on all surfaces. The machine detects carpets automatically and changes the suction power and adds more power as needed to pull out grounded dirt and debris. On hard floors, its double rotary mops spin at 180 RPM with high pressure and mops away grime and leaving your floors spotless. The mops are supported by a 2.5L water tank so that the machine can clean up to 2,152 square feet in one single cleaning session.

Obviously, this Dreame robot vacuum is also equipped with an RGB camera and 3D structured light so that it learns your home map in an instant and recognizes obstacles in real time. The vacuum then adjusts to create customized cleaning pathways based on the type of room, floor type, and potential obstacles like furniture or wires. The AI system ensures thorough coverage with fewer possibilities of getting stuck.

The device also offers extensive customization through its companion app: You can create multiple maps for multi-level homes, set virtual walls or no-go zones and schedule cleaning sessions according to your liking (when you're not at home for instance). Voice control integration with Alexa adds another layer of convenience by allowing you to start or stop cleaning with voice commands.

Battery life is also an area where the Dreame L10s Ultra excels: Its 5200mAh lithium-ion battery provides as much as three hours of running time in Quiet mode which is more than enough time to vacuum large homes without interruption. Even when switched to Turbo mode for tougher grime, it still does very well before needing to be recharged.

What's for sure is that the current Amazon deal is absolutely unbeatable value for a robot vacuum with this many features that it matches models triple its price. This all-time low price won't last long!

Buying cloud storage might seem like the modern solution for managing your files, but let's be honest—it comes with its own set of challenges. Subscription fees stack up over time, and you're often left wondering about the safety and privacy of your data.

For those who prefer a reliable, one-time investment, nothing beats a physical hard drive at home. As it is, the Seagate Portable 5TB external hard drive is available for just $112 on Amazon, down from $129 just ahead of the tariffs hike. The 4TB model is priced at $118 (down from $124) which makes it less relevant.

See 5TB at Amazon

The Seagate 5TB external HDD is a high-quality storage solution if you're dealing with large files, whether they're photos, videos, games or critical documents. With a massive 5TB of storage space, this drive can hold up to 700 five-minute 4K videos or over two million average files. It's perfect for backing up priceless family videos or for expanding your gaming library without worrying about running out of space.

Small and portable, the Seagate drive itself is only 4.54 inches in length and 3.15 inches in width which allows it to fit easily into a bag or even a pocket. Weighing in at only 0.56 lbs, it's built to be portable without sacrificing durability. Its slim black profile will make it fit easily into any environment, at home or on the road.

The drive features USB 3.0 connectivity for transfer speeds up to ten times faster than USB 2.0. This provides fast and effective transfer of large files—like high-definition movies or entire collections of games. For compatibility with older systems, the Seagate drive is also backward compatible with USB 2.0 ports at reduced speeds. Its plug-and-play nature simplifies setup: simply plug it in with the included USB cable, and your PC or Mac will recognize it immediately with no software to install.

It is pre-formatted as exFAT and works with Windows and macOS computers right out of the box. This compatibility is great if you work on both operating systems or need an OS-agnostic storage device. Mac users who would like to use Time Machine backups can also reformat the drive to their needs without any issues. Gamers will love this hard drive too as it plugs in flawlessly with Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Whether you're safeguarding memories or expanding your digital library, this is a great deal!

xLight aims to deliver a powerful alternative LPP source for ASML EUV tools by 2028.

Legendary Intel CTO and CEO Pat Gelsinger is now serving as executive chairman at xLight, a startup developing a free electron laser (FEL) technology as a light source for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems.

Using a particle accelerator to generate light for litho machines has been discussed previously, but xLight claims it can produce such a source by 2028 — while maintaining compatibility with existing tools.

""As part of my new role at Playground Global, I have joined xLight as executive chairman of the board,"" Gelsinger wrote in a LinkedIn post. ""I will be working closely with Nicholas Kelez and team to build the world's most powerful Free Electron Lasers (FEL) by leveraging particle accelerator technology.""



EUV lithography is an advanced technique used for semiconductor manufacturing to create extremely small — we are talking about an 8nm resolution for High-NA EUV and a ~13nm for Low-NA EUV — circuit patterns on silicon wafers that uses EUV light with a 13.5nm wavelength. At present, only ASML can build EUV litho systems and these use an intricate way of producing light with a 13.5nm wavelength.

There is more than one way to create a light with an extremely short wavelength to produce chips with an 8nm ~ 13.5nm resolution, however. One of them is to use a particle accelerator as a laser produced plasma (LPP) light source.

xLight has created an LPP source that delivers four times the power of the most advanced systems available today, according to the Gelsinger's post. ASML's Twinscan NXE:3600D has a 250W LPP source, whereas the NXE:3800E is equipped with a ~300W source.

While ASML has demonstrated EUV source powers above 500W in research settings, these higher power levels are not yet available in commercially deployed systems. Yet ASML continues to work towards increasing EUV source power, with plans to double output to 600W and a roadmap extending beyond 1,000W.

Apparently, xLight and Gelsinger claim that the company has an LPP source that is beyond 1,000W today and that will be ready for commercial applications by 2028.

Gelsinger claims that xLight's technology cuts per-wafer costs by around 50% and lowers both capital and operating expenses by threefold, which is a major leap in manufacturing efficiency. While we do know the approximate price of ASML's Twinscan NXE:3800E (around $240 - $250 million), we do cannot really guess the price of the light source alone.

Meanwhile, the claim that the new LPP source can lower capital expenses and operating costs by three times can potentially mean a substantial decrease of a FEL-based litho tool cost compared to today's machines from ASML.

Speaking of ASML, it is important to note that xLight does not aim to replace ASML's EUV litho tools, but produce an LPP source that ""will be connected to an ASML scanner and running wafers by 2028."" This may mean that xLight's LPP source will be compatible with existing ASML tools, but it is unclear whether it will be compatible with next-generation High-NA EUV tools (most probably yes, as they use the same LPP sources as existing Low-NA EUV tools). It also remains to be seen whether xLight's LPP source can be attached to TwinScan machines in fab environments.

Remember that fabs are built to accommodate specific tools and in case of Low-NA EUV systems it means that the light source is located below the machine itself, whereas in case of High-NA EUV tool its LPP source is located on the same level, so any 'third party' LPP source has to take these facts into account. For now, the particle accelerator looks rather big for existing fabs, so FEL is probably applicable for next generation of fabs if it is proved efficient.

It is noteworthy that while xLight believes that its FEL technology represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity in the long term, it also opens near-term revenue in other key areas. The company believes that its systems are well-suited for high-power metrology and inspection tools. Perhaps, even beyond semiconductors, as it can address challenges in national security and biotech: from point defense and space debris control to medical imaging and scientific research.

Obviously beyond repair, the components that survived the blaze were salvaged.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


One of the most horrifyingly burned graphics cards that we have seen has been featured in a components salvage video. Software developer and hobbyist graphics card repairer Patryk runs the DIY Repair Hour YouTube channel, where work on this seriously charred Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 was uploaded.

It is worth highlighting that this isn't a GPU from a house fire or other external 'act of God' style catastrophe. The card apparently set on fire in a working PC which suffered from a power connector issue. Patryk was told that the PSU in use was from a mining rig, and this PSU didn't have the luxury of overcurrent protection (OCP), so the combustion of the power connector and ensuing electrical mayhem didn't cut the power delivery. From the video comments, it seems to be that the RTX 4070 owner was alerted of the burning card by ""the horrible smell.""

Patryk's conclusion is that the burning ""certainly started at or near the 12V PCIE connector."" So Nvidia's compact, concentrated power connector isn't completely blameless here. However, using a PSU without basic safety features like OCP was an obvious issue, allowing this unfortunate event to go much further than it should have. In fact, we can't even see any remnants of the controversial power connector, as the combustion was so intense.

As this Palit RTX 4070 was so far gone, Patryk and the graphics card owner had no illusions about its repairability. From the start, the mission here was to simply salvage any good components that remained on the PCB.

Fast forwarding to the end of the video, you will learn that the biggest and most expensive component here, the GPU die, is claimed to be ""healthy."" The TechTuber verified this with a multitude of multimeter measurements. Sadly, we didn't see the GPU put onto a working PCB to confirm it was AOK, though.

Other components salvaged from this charred mess include a selection of memory chips, power stages, video BIOS, some ports, and other things. Patryk didn't verify all these bits were 100% good, but assumed they would be fine as they were further away from the fire zone than the GPU core.

If there's a lesson to be learned here, it is that yes-indeed pay attention to your tricky Nvidia GPU power connector - but don't neglect using an appropriate and high quality PSU.

The king of the castle is here.

Asus has finally unveiled the ROG Crosshair X870E Extreme motherboard, standing as their flagship offering for the AM5 platform. The motherboard was showcased by Tony Yu at an ROG event held in China yesterday, and is set to launch in late April, priced at 9,999 Chinese Yuan, or around $1,400.

Positioned at the top of Asus' motherboard stack, the X870E Extreme offers a dual-Ethernet setup with two USB4 40 Gbps ports, support for Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi 7, three PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots, alongside two PCIe 5.0 x16 expansion slots, just to name a few. ROG's top-tier motherboards are divided into two camps: Maximus for Intel and Crosshair for AMD. Under these designations exist several sub-brands like Apex, Hero, Formula, and Gene, followed by Extreme, which serves as Asus' most premium (and expensive) option for any given platform.

Following a sneak peek two weeks back, the X870E Extreme is now officially available on Asus' website with comprehensive details, and there's a lot to unpack today. Moving away from the colorful and anime-inspired theme of the previous model, the X870E Extreme adopts a more minimalistic and professional finish, with the E-ATX (Extended ATX) form factor. The power delivery is handled by a combination of 20 power stages at 110A, two additional 110A stages, and two 80A stages powered by dual 8-pin EPS connectors at the top.

In terms of memory support, the X870E Extreme is equipped with four DIMM slots, supporting up to 256GB of memory, with overclocking speeds exceeding 9,000 MT/s on Ryzen 9000 series processors. To the right, there's a small DIMM.2 slot if you need to attach additional M.2 SSDs. The motherboard carries two full-sized PCIe 5.0 x16 expansion slots, with support for Q-Release Slim, presumably with the updated design. The included full-color 5-inch LCD can slide to the right to avoid fan obstruction.

In total, the X870E Extreme provides five M.2 slots, with three supporting PCIe 5.0 x4 speeds and the other two at PCIe 4.0 x4 speeds through the DIMM.2 slot. The first M.2 slot beneath the CPU cooler is equipped with a 3D vapor chamber for heat dissipation. This is in addition to four SATA 6 Gb/s ports for your HDDs and SATA SSDs. The chipset and the remaining M.2 SSDs are guarded by a heatsink for cooling. The right side offers a Q-LED, START, and FLEXKEY buttons with several right-angled connectors.

Wireless connectivity is handled by Wi-Fi 7 (320 MHz) and Bluetooth 5.4, in tandem with a dual-Ethernet solution for wired networking, featuring a Realtek 5GbE port and a Marvell AQtion 10GbE port. Front-panel USB options include a 20 Gbps port (Type-C with 60W PD/QC4+/PPS), a USB 10 Gbps port (Type-C), four USB 5 Gbps ports, and four USB 2.0 ports (using two internal headers each). On the back side, you get two USB4 (40 Gbps) ports, 10x USB 10 Gbps ports (eight Type-A + two Type-C), a BIOS Flashback, and a Clear CMOS button, just to name a few.

According to Asus China, the X870E Extreme will hit shelves in late April, priced at 9,999 Chinese Yuan (~$1,400). We're guessing the pricing will extend to its global counterpart.

These bad keyboard combos will destroy your day. Here's how to reverse the damage.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Keyboard shortcuts are almost always incredibly helpful, allowing you to perform in one stroke a task that might otherwise require many clicks and menu selections. But there are times when hitting the wrong combination of shortcut keys by accident can break your user experience in ways you might not know how to fix.

You might be typing along one day, minding your business, and your computer just starts talking to you. This happened to me more than once! Or you're surfing the web and you suddenly end up with everything zoomed all the way in. Or maybe some of your letter keys mysteriously start to function as arrow keys, seemingly out of nowhere.

Believe it or not, all of these problems and more are possible, thanks to supposedly helpful features that can destroy your user experience if you enable them by mistake. These are the 12 horrifying self-destruct keys in Windows 11 (or 10) that you need to avoid.



The first and worst self-destruct keyboard combo is Windows Narrator, which you might accidentally invoke by hitting Windows key + CTRL + Enter. This feature is designed to help the visually impaired by reading most of the text on-screen through your speakers, with a robotic voice.

But imagine enabling Windows Narrator by accident when you're in an open office or a coffee shop, your computer blaring the subject line of your latest email message for everyone to hear. That's not only a violation of your privacy, but also a huge embarrassment.

The good news is that you can disable Narrator by hitting the same exact keyboard combination you used to accidentally enable it. The even better news is that you can disable the shortcut itself by navigating to Settings->Accessibility->Narrator and toggling “Keyboard shortcut for Narrator” to off. Then you won't even be able to turn it on by accident.





Like summoning Candyman, the Sticky Keys dialog box appears when you ask for it five times. You ask for it by hitting the Shift key five times in a row, something you might do one day out of boredom or frustration. Then up pops a dialog box asking if you want to turn on Sticky Keys.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

If you're smart, you'll just say “no” to the dialog box and all will be well. But if you mistakenly click “Yes,” Sticky Keys is enabled and your user experience will be worse than being pursued by a ghost with a hook for a hand.

Sticky Keys changes Windows so that you can hit the modifier keys (Shift, CTRL, ALT or the Windows key) one at a time and still form keyboard shortcuts with them. Imagine hitting CTRL by itself and then later you're typing and you hit the letter x. The system treats it as CTRL + X or cut. Or you hit the Windows key to launch your Start menu and then later you type E. It treats that as Win + E, which launches the File Explorer. Pandemonium ensues.

If you've accidentally enabled Sticky Keys, you can disable it the same way, by hitting Shift five times and then clicking No when presented with the dialog box. But why not just turn off the Sticky Keys keyboard shortcut in the first place by navigating to Settings -> Accessibility ->Keyboard->Sticky Keys and toggling “Keyboard shortcut for Sticky keys” to off?





You're surfing the web in your favorite browser – maybe it's Chrome or Edge – and you suddenly see a new pane on the right side of the screen filled with code. It could be showing you JavaScript errors or HTML, but if you're not a developer, this is a very unwelcome intrusion into your day.

If you've hit CTRL + Shift + I or F12 by accident, you've opened the Developer Tools menu in your browser. For those of us who code web pages for a living, this is a valuable utility that helps view the source of our pages or debug errors. But for most people, it's a confusing waste of space.

You can close the Developer Tools either by clicking the X button in its upper right corner or by hitting CTRL + Shift + I a second time.

The tab you're browsing just disappeared, gone as though some evil wizard teleported it off your screen. And you really were getting into that story you had clicked about the cast of Degrassi Junior High … what they look like now is jaw-dropping! Your jaw had fully dropped — and now the entire web page is gone.

You accidentally hit CTRL + W, which closes a tab in any modern browser. Even worse, you may have hit Alt + F4, which closes the entire window. If you just closed the tab, you can restore it by hitting CTRL + Shift + T.



You're in Excel, trying to move from one cell to another, but instead, the entire screen starts to move while the focus stays fixed on the cell you had focused on. This happens because you accidentally enabled Scroll Lock, an ancient feature that doesn't work in most programs but is still recognized in Excel.

Scroll Lock causes the entire screen to scroll and keeps your cursor in place. The way to turn it off is to hit the key again. On some keyboards, like my Cooler Master MK770, it's a key combination of Fn + another key.

You're reading an article, perhaps this one on Tom's Hardware, and all of a sudden it's zoomed way in, or the text is painfully small because it's zoomed way out. You were just trying to scroll down the web page but now everything is out of whack. How the heck did that happen?

It probably happened because you (or maybe your cat?) were holding down the CTRL key while you were moving your mouse's scroll wheel. This causes any browser – Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc – to zoom in or out. Moving the scroll wheel up zooms in and moving the scroll wheel down zooms out. You can fix this by using it to zoom in or out again to a comfortable level.



You're editing a document in any text editor and you realize that you used the American spelling of color when you're trying to appeal to a UK audience. You move the cursor over to the space between the O and the R and type the letter U so you can make the word “colour.” But instead of just adding the additional letter, it overwrites the R so you have “colou” as your word.

What happened? You hit the Insert key, which toggles the OS between Insert and Overwrite modes. By default, every computer uses Insert mode, which places new letters to the right of the cursor as you type. If you hit the Insert key, however, you turn on Overwrite mode, which causes you to replace whatever's next to your cursor.

Overwrite is the behavior users were used to in old DOS text editors such as WordPerfect 5.1; today we all expect new characters to be added to our document and, if we want to delete a letter, we hit the Del or Backspace key. Hit Insert again to change the mode back to Insert mode.

You're in your web browser editing something in Google Docs or reading. All of a sudden, the tabs are gone, the address bar is gone, and even the window widgets (X, minimize, and maximize) are all gone. Yikes!

You've hit F11, which turns the browser and many other programs into a full-screen program, with all the widgets from the window gone. Hit F11 again to restore the window to its former glory.

You've just found the answer you were looking for to a very particular tech problem. Perhaps a search engine led you to one of our articles or forum posts. Perhaps you were looking up hakarl recipes and landed on an Icelandic cooking website. Whatever you found, you've suddenly lost it: Your browser has gone back a page or two.

Fortunately, hitting the forward button in your browser solves this problem, but why did it happen in the first place? Chances are that you either hit Alt + Left arrow, which takes you back, or you hit the thumb button on your mouse, which in most cases defaults to browser back if you haven't set it to do something else.

You move your pointer over to a window, but suddenly the window starts being dragged around, even though your finger's not on the mouse button. You move the cursor around a document and, all of a sudden, the pointer starts highlighting text. Again, you're not holding down the mouse button, so what gives? Is there a ghost dragging and highlighting things on your PC?

Someone has probably enabled Click Lock, a feature that makes Windows act as if you are holding down the mouse button after you've just clicked one time. This is a useful accessibility feature for someone with a sore clicking finger, but is a nightmare for most people.

To disable Click Lock, navigate to the old Control Panel->Mouse. Then uncheck “Turn on Click Lock.”



Now, here's a nightmare feature that a few keyboards have and it's not widely advertised. You start typing and notice that when you hit W, A, S or D (the WASD keys), they act as arrows, not as letters. The arrow keys act as W, A, S and D.

On a few modern gaming keyboards, hitting Fn + W swaps the arrow and WASD keys. This is probably supposed to help left-handed gamers, but it just leads to nightmares. If this happens to you, hit Fn + W to bring the setting back to normal.

I depend on the bookmarks bar in Chrome, the set of bookmarks that appears below the address bar / toolbar. That's where I put shortcuts to very important tools such as my Gmail inbox, our CMS. or the Tom's Hardware editorial calendar. Sure, the bar takes up a few pixels of vertical real estate, but it's worth every single dot.

If you use the bookmarks bar in Chrome or another browser and one day it just disappears, be sure to hit CTRL + Shift + B to make it appear again.

The LaserPecker LP5 is a premium, portable machine that can engrave just about anything with dual 20W Diode and Fiber lasers, but it is seriously hampered by clunky software and a noticeable lack of interface.

The LaserPecker LP5 is a small laser cutter and engraver that works on nearly any material thanks to twin galvo lasers: a 20-watt diode and a 20-watt fiber. It can cut and engrave softer materials with the diode and also carve metal and stone with the laser fiber. The machine is advertised as portable, but like the LP4 before it, there's still a tiny gap in the protective shielding that requires safety glasses for anyone in the room. LaserPecker sent the custom enclosure for this review, which makes the laser safe around your family and pets.

The LP5 has a few improvements over the LP4 we reviewed in 2023, but it also has a puzzling lack of its best features. The very informative touch screen – with a time display – is sadly missing. Also, there doesn't seem to be an off button, but it can be powered off by holding down the pause button for a few seconds. This isn't explained in the manual, and I only discovered it after prowling internet forums. Before figuring this out, I thought you had to unplug it.

The lack of a countdown timer on the laser or an estimated burn time on the software is maddening. Maybe a timer isn't needed for etching wood when it only takes a minute or two, but the real showstopper is LaserPecker's ability to deeply etch a 3D bas-relief in stone or metal. This took hours. Twice, I started to etch a brass coin, only to pull the plug because I needed to leave the house or go to bed after 2 or 3 hours of burning. I finally got the sample coin to complete when I started it in the morning. It took over 4 hours to burn.

The software provided by LaserPecker is missing material presets, which requires you to run your own tests. This was a major let down and not something I would expect with a premium laser dubbed “smart” on its website.

Retailing at $3,299 and currently on sale for $2,899, the LaserPecker LP5 costs more than many larger lasers with similar features. While it's a powerful machine and fun to experiment with, sadly, it did not make our list of best laser cutters and engravers. The optional enclosure we tested costs $699 but is on sale currently for $559.

The LaserPecker LP5 comes with everything you need to assemble the laser: a pair of laser safety glasses and a shield. You also get a few samples of wood, slate, leather, and metal for testing. There was also a nice wooden keychain. However, I accidentally set it on fire due to lack of settings.

We also requested the optional enclosure, which included a built-in camera.



The LaserPecker LP5 is a compact, portable laser that looks a bit like a high-end kitchen mixer. It has a premium feel to it, with brushed metal surfaces and tangle-free cords wrapped in fabric. The fans needed to cool this beast down are pretty loud and always on. It comes with a pipe to vent the exhaust away – you can put it outside a window or door, but we ran it through an air filter from a different manufacturer. Metal dust is pretty thick, and we clogged up one filter during our testing.

Unlike large flatbed machines, the LaserPecker is a Galvo laser. This means the laser stays in one spot, and the beam is moved across the work surface rapidly with a set of mirrors. This is the same motion system seen in laser light shows. The nature of this motion restricts its burn area to a circle, so it can't reach into the far corners of its build plate. You get the best results from items placed dead center.

The LaserPecker LP5 has PC software and mobile apps that you can download for free. The mobile app duplicates all the functions of the PC software, so you don't need to be tethered to a laptop if you have the app installed.

One of the things I miss from the LaserPecker LP4 is the top-mounted touchscreen, which displays valuable information like burn time and percentage complete. The new LP5 has no screen at all, just a preview button, an Emergency Stop button, and a pause button (which doubles as an off button).



The flat baseplate has holes for screw mounted material holders – these holes go completely through the plate and so it should not be used for cutting. A grill with a solid bottom is provided for cutting, which offers much needed airflow for cleaner edges.

The laser module can tilt on the stand to engrave large objects placed next to it. It can also be completely removed from the stand and used freehand if you're feeling particularly brave.

The laser is hooded with a detachable cone for safety, but there's a slight gap at the bottom, so you'll still want to wear the safety goggles provided. The cone has been improved since the LP4 and now has a removable panel to allow access to the work pieces inside. You can purchase an optional enclosure, which allows you to use the machine around other people and your pets.



Focusing the laser is very easy. When you click “preview,” in the design software, you'll get two red dots from the laser. Position your material under the dots and raise or lower the laser until the red dots combine into one. There's also a “live preview” box that projects a blue rectangle that represents the artwork to help get everything in the right spot.

I requested the enclosure to test for this machine to be extra safe as I don't want to lock myself in a room away from my family and pets while testing the laser. The enclosure is valuable for professionals who need to use a laser in public spaces like stores, studios, and craft fairs. It replaces the stand, with the laser module screwed into the top of the box. A camera located inside the box helps frame your work.



I assembled the LaserPecker LP5 in about 15 minutes – it was just a matter of installing a few screws and plugging in USB cords.



The LaserPecker LP5 is a Class 4 laser that can damage your eyes and burn skin. Placing it inside the enclosure elevates it to a Class 1. It also produces smoke and fumes while engraving or cutting materials. You must take precautions to operate the machine safely. Use this and any other laser at your own risk.

The machine is equipped with a safety cone over the laser module that covers the working surface. An emergency panic button on the top of the machine will halt operation. You can set the machine to turn off when the cover is removed, but this is not on by default. Another sensor detects high temperatures and can shut off the laser to avoid fires. An exhaust fan removes smoke from the laser area to improve performance and the environment. A tilt detector will shut off the laser if it tilts during operation.

There is a slight gap between the shield and the material. Because of this gap, you must always wear safety glasses for extra protection. A pair is provided with the machine.

The optional enclosure is well worth the extra cost, as it completely seals the laser from view. It also helps control smoke emitted from the materials that you're burning.

Prevent pets and other people from observing the laser while in use. Since the laser is literally burning material, never allow it to operate unattended and have a fire extinguisher handy just in case.

This is a portable laser, which means you can use it freehand if you take appropriate care.

Some materials should not be burned with a laser due to their chemical makeup – they could melt, catch fire or produce toxic fumes. Dallas Maker Space has published a list of safe and hazardous materials to use with their laser. The list of no-nos includes plastics, fiberglass and certain foams.

The laser lens can get dirty from smoke and fumes. You will need to wipe it clean – while unplugged – before each laser session. If it's allowed to become dirty, the laser will lose some of its capability.



LaserPecker has its own software suite and a mobile app called LaserPecker Design Space. It's also compatible with premium LightBurn software, though lacking a current subscription, I didn't test LightBurn.

Design Space on either platform lacks good presets for materials, so you'll need to do a lot of testing. The program waffled between engravings that were too light and setting my materials on fire. This was a disappointing experience for a modern $3,000 machine.



The LP5 connects using Wi-Fi, USB cord, or USB stick. The connection wasn't very stable for my phone, and I struggled to get it working. The app should be a miniature version of the PC software, and it seems to have a lot of features, but it wasn't very intuitive to use.

There were no tutorials on the phone app for the LP5 at all, so hopefully, a future update will fix the problem.



The ability to cut or engrave materials is determined by the speed and power settings of the laser. The LaserPecker LP5 has a medium power, 20-watt diode laser that can cut through thin wood up to 15mm, and a 20-watt fiber laser that can slice thin metal sheets that are one millimeter thick.

This machine's best use for wood is for light engraving, as the lack of air assist causes a lot of flame and char. I was able to sand off light brown char on some of the wood I engraved, which makes the finished pieces much nicer. On the samples below, I made a QR Code to the Tom's Hardware website using a tool in LaserPecker's Design Space. The suggested preset was too light, but increasing power introduced smudges from the smoke. I tried using masking tape to protect the wood – which might work for simpler designs. In the end, sanding the piece gave me the best results.

Design Space lets you pick different resolution levels, from 1K to 8K. It also measures the speed with “depth”, but a 40% depth is not necessarily a 40% cut through your piece. The best result on these precut wooden tags was a 4k resolution, with a 40% depth and 40% power. This burn took a few minutes, and the software did not record the time nor give me an estimate.



I tested the LP5 with various metal pieces. This is one of the 0.007 inch painted aluminum business cards I picked up from x-Tool. The machine made quick work of this clip art flower, but without presets, I had to make a few guesses on the settings. I used the fiber laser at 100% depth and 100% power, and it cut it out in less than a minute with one pass.



Turning down the depth setting on the fiber laser allowed quick engraving of the painted aluminum. This was 50% depth and 20% power and only took a few seconds.



3D engraving metal coins is a real showstopper, but Design Studio doesn't tell you how long it will take. I had to try it a few times after I ran out of time and did not want to leave the laser unattended. The first coin is after 2 hours of burning, and the completed one is after about 4. This was a presliced demo on the USB stick, so I'm unsure of the settings. The coin also needs to be polished (I used a Dremel) to make it shiny once you're done.



The LaserPecker LP5 is a very fast and versatile Galvo laser that can engrave just about anything thanks to its dual Diode and Fiber lasers. Not having good presets leads to a lot of trial and toasted wood to get it right. The $2,899 retail price tag is a bit steep for what you're getting – a small, portable laser that still requires safety glasses and/or an additional enclosure to use.

It's got a lot of potential as an engraving machine, but the software makes it frustrating to use. Design Space has plenty of creative tools and the ability to import photos or clip art to transform them into lasered art. Not having a timer or estimate anywhere is super annoying, especially since you're not supposed to let a laser work unattended.

If you want a dual diode and IR laser that's truly safe and portable, check out the xTool F1, currently available for $1,399. If you want more room for lasering large items, then check out the 20W WeCreat Vision for $1,299.

A landmark study presented today at ESCMID Global 2025 has revealed that over 3 million children worldwide lost their lives in 2022 due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR)-related infections.

The study underscores the urgent need for both regional and global strategies to control paediatric AMR, particularly in high-burden areas such as South-East Asia and Africa. AMR poses a critical threat to children, who are highly vulnerable to infections. Access to new antibiotic formulations is often much more limited for children because of product development delays.

The study data found that in 2022 alone, more than 752,000 children in Southeast Asia and 659,000 children in Africa died of AMR-associated complications. Many of these deaths were linked to the use of Watch antibiotics (drugs with a high risk of resistance) and Reserve antibiotics (last-resort treatments for severe, multidrug-resistant infections).

Watch and Reserve antibiotics are not intended for first-line treatment and their use should be limited only for those who need them to preserve their effectiveness and reduce the development of resistance. In contrast, Access antibiotics are those that are more widely available and used to treat common infections due to their lower potential for increasing resistance.

Between 2019 and 2021, the use of Watch antibiotics increased by 160% in Southeast Asia and 126% in Africa. During the same period, the use of Reserve antibiotics rose by 45% in Southeast Asia and 125% in Africa.

Globally, of the more than 3 million children's deaths, 2 million were associated with the use of Watch and Reserve antibiotics.

While the rise in use of Watch and Reserve antibiotics may be necessary in response to the concurrent rise in drug-resistant infections, the sharp rise in use of these drugs presents several serious long-term risks. Their increased use, especially without careful oversight, elevates the risk of resistance and limits future treatment options. If bacteria develop resistance to these antibiotics, there will be few, if any, alternatives for treating multidrug-resistance infections."" 

Professor Joseph Harwell, study co-author

Several factors contribute to the severity of AMR in low- and middle-income countries, including overcrowded hospitals, poor sanitation, and weak infection prevention measures that facilitate the spread of resistant pathogens within healthcare settings and communities. Due to a lack of diagnostic tools and concerns over misdiagnosis, overuse and misuse of antibiotics are also widespread in these regions. Additionally, many low- and middle-income countries lack effective national surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship programmes, making it difficult to track resistance trends and establish effective treatment protocols.

""Rising resistance to Watch and Reserve antibiotics will ultimately lead to higher treatment failure,"" said Professor Harwell. ""Mortality rates, which are already alarmingly high, will continue to rise significantly, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where access to alternative treatments and advanced medical interventions may be limited.""

Professor Harwell furthered, ""Addressing this issue requires urgent and coordinated action at both the regional and global levels. Global and national surveillance on AMR must adopt a 'One Health' approach, with cost-effective systems that can inform treatment guidelines and measure the impact of control interventions.""

""On a regional level, we call on policymakers to mandate hospital-based antimicrobial stewardship programmes in all paediatric healthcare facilities. Improved age classifications in surveillance data will also enhance our understanding of important differences in resistance rates across the age categories, as well as pediatric-specific resistance mechanisms. Additionally, we urge the implementation of national guidelines to ensure routine surveillance informs antibiotic use,"" concluded Professor Harwell.

...

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that.

They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat.

They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes.

In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer.

All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday.

“Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later.

“We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added.

In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. We have to want to be here 100%. We have to fight.”

But on Sunday, they floundered. For most of the first half, they didn't take the risks nor show the “aggression” they said they would. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own.

Soon thereafter, Diego Luna tried to inject life into the USMNT, and into another snoozefest. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers.

""The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want,"" Pochettino said postgame.

At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. He poked a clever square ball to Patrick Agyemang, who equalized with a firm finish.

The two Major League Soccer attackers, two of five changes to the U.S. starting lineup, seemed to lift a lagging team back into the game.

Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. The USMNT was once against stagnant. Why?

""I think we need to have every single person buy into exactly what we're doing and what we're trying to do,"" Adams said postgame. ""It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us.""

Not long after halftime, they receded again. They nearly conceded two penalties. (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) Then, in the 59th minute, they conceded again. Jonathan David put Canada up 2-1.

And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players.

It ended with Pochettino ""disappointed,"" again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright.

""I want to send the message to the fans: Don't be pessimistic,"" Pochettino said.

But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: ""In football, anything can happen.""

And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt ""shame"" after the two losses, and promising, again, that ""next time"" would be different.

Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup.

""I'm never concerned, man. It's football,"" he said. ""You gotta show up in big moments, when the moments matter. We didn't show up in this window here. We've showed up in the past, in moments when we needed to.""","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Rasmus Hojlund's second season stats at Manchester United make for grim reading with the 22-year-old managing only three Premier League goals all season.

Only two of them have come under Ruben Amorim who has been far from impressed with the Dane, who endured another miserable night on Thursday against Olympique Lyonnais.

Apart from the lack of goals, the 22-year-old's overall gameplay has also left a lot to be desired with the former Atalanta ace always more eager to back into defenders that use his smarts to deal with pressure from defenders.

While the Denmark international is still young, the head coach does not have the luxury of time and he wants to move him on and replace him with a ruthless goalscorer in the summer.

However, INEOS are aware that not too many teams will pay the initial fee of £64 million the Red Devils had splurged on Hojlund in 2023 given his woeful form, and are hence open to the idea of a loan exit.

Juventus and Napoli are among the teams interested in the out-of-form striker with TuttoSport claiming that the Turin-based club are ready to move ahead with a loan offer.

The Bianconeri are eyeing a loan deal with an option to make the move permanent but the deal has to be done before the Club World Cup which begins in two months time.

“Rasmus Hojlund needs to be revitalized. But it would also be a low-cost deal for this reason, with Juve sniffing out the possibility of a loan, perhaps at a cost, with a view to purchasing in the future.

“Nothing has been agreed at the moment. However, there have been exploratory contacts from the Juventus management towards the player's entourage.

“The English club's idea for next season is to seriously restructure the forward department and they would prefer to say goodbye to the Dane, also for the prospect of a better deal.

“From Juventus' perspective the prospect of having him right away for the Club World Cup is quite tempting, since he would numerically replace Milik, destined for an early separation.”

The Peoples Person had written about the 20-time English league champions slapping a €60 million price tag on Hojlund's head and it will be intriguing to see how this saga unfolds.

Esperance de Tunis have a glittering history, but may find themselves outmatched by more traditional powers

One of four teams flying the flag for Africa in the Club World Dup, Esperance de Tunis have a wonderful history. They have 33 Tunisian top-flight titles, have won the Tunisian Cup 15 times, and have appeared in 14 straight CAF Champions Leagues. Success, then, is nothing new.

But it remains to be seen how well that might translate to a 32-team Club World Cup. While those 48 trophies are wonderful, they may find themselves challenged on the big stage. Still, there are plenty of reasons for excitement.

This is their fourth appearance at some iteration of the Club World Cup. They have yet to win a game at the competition but have held their own every time. For all of their disadvantages, they won't be pushovers. And perhaps being a tricky matchup, and representing a club with a wonderful pedigree might be enough.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will be played in 12 stadiums in 11 U.S. cities, from the opener on June 14 until the final on July 13. In the U.S., fans can stream or watch matches on DAZN or TNT. Leading up to kickoff, GOAL will provide scouting reports on each of the 32 participating teams in the expanded field.

FIFA, soccer's global governing body, on Thursday delivered fans a “first-of-its-kind offer” to the 2025 Club World Cup, which will debut in the United States this summer, with ticket packs that include “guaranteed” access to the 2026 men's World Cup — the grander international tournament that will also be held in the U.S. a year later.

Per the “Terms of Sale” document, here's how it works:

Buyers of a standard “pack,” which features tickets to two or three Club World Cup matches, “will be granted a guaranteed option to buy one ticket to a FIFA World Cup 26 match in the United States (excluding the final),” FIFA said in a Thursday release.

In clause 4.2 of the Terms of Sale, is that FIFA can determine which 2026 World Cup match(es), and what type of ticket(s), the fan will have access to. Clause 2.4 also says: ""Tickets available to be included within Ticket Packages shall be subject to availability and available for purchase on a first-come first-served basis. By way of these Terms of Sale, FIFA Ticketing makes no guarantees as to the availability of Tickets and any indication on the availability of Tickets by FIFA Ticketing is for guidance purposes.""

First, fans mustn't resell those tickets, and must actually use them — meaning they or a family member or friend must go to the game. They will then be offered the chance to buy a 2026 World Cup ticket — match and seat specifics to be revealed later.

The second offering is the “Super Ticket Pack.” This package “features one ticket per match to 20 FIFA Club World Cup 2025 matches,” and then “a guaranteed option to buy one ticket” to the 2026 World Cup final, the most prestigious event in all of sports.

The buyer of a “super ticket pack” must “use all [20] tickets to attend all [20] matches,” and the matches must be on 20 different days. (There are only 22 distinct Club World Cup matchdays.)

Alternatively, per the terms, they could share the pack with “guests” — someone with whom they're “capable of demonstrating a pre-existing relationship.” Those guests could attend some of the 20 matches in their place. Among the fans and their guests, they'd get the right to buy one 2026 World Cup ticket.

Ticket prices for 2026 have not yet been announced, and tickets won't go on sale until the fall. FIFA has closely guarded all details.

Ticket prices for the 2025 Club World Cup, meanwhile, are roughly the same as they were when first released in December, both on Ticketmaster and within this “ticket pack” promotion via FIFA. “Category 1” seats — those in lower levels — cost anywhere from $100 to upward of $200, before taxes and fees, in the group stage; they cost $2,600, plus taxes and fees, for the final.

“Category 2” seats — typically those in a stadium's upper deck along the sideline — range from roughly $60 to $140 before taxes and fees in the group stage. Some cheaper tickets have been sold to supporters of the participating clubs.

However, the prices are far higher than those charged by the biggest European soccer clubs and have caused some consternation among fans. Bailey Brown, president of the Independent Supporters Council, a group representing soccer fans across the U.S. and Canada, told Yahoo Sports in December that she was worried that “many of the most passionate fans will be priced out of enjoying the sport.”

With two months of the opener, between Inter Miami and Al Ahly at Hard Rock Stadium in South Florida, many seats remain available.

In an effort to sell them, FIFA president Gianni Infantino has been holding promotional events alongside soccer dignitaries and celebrities.

Last month, he leveraged his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump to bring the Club World Cup trophy into the Oval Office, and leave it there on display. He used a media session alongside Trump to pump up the tournament and place it on par with the big World Cup.

Infantino's Instagram account is with filled posts promoting the Club World Cup. FIFA and its partners, in messages to everyone from soccer fans to NFL season ticket holders, have been marketing the event as “the most prestigious club soccer tournament in history.” They have been telling stakeholders that it will be “as big as the last [men's] World Cup,” according to multiple people who've heard FIFA's pitch.

After attempting to drum up interest, FIFA and Infantino ultimately struck a global broadcast deal with DAZN, which soon thereafter announced an equivalent investment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.

And so, after years of uncertainty, the Club World Cup is happening. It will pay out $1 billion in appearance fees and prize money to the 32 participating clubs.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Home > News > Mokwena's Future At Wydad Uncertain Ahead of Club World Cup

South African coach Rulani Mokwena is expected to lead Wydad at the tournament. They will face Manchester City and Juventus in Philadelphia, then play Al Ain in Washington DC.

FIFA has highlighted Wydad Casablanca's wins under ex-coach Walid Regragui ahead of the new Club World Cup in the US next summer.

Regragui led Wydad to the 2021-22 league title with 63 points. It was their second in a row – the first time in 19 years – and their 22nd overall.

He also helped them win the CAF Champions League in 2022, earning a spot at the 2025 Club World Cup. Two months later, he took charge of Morocco and led them to a historic World Cup run to semi-finals – a first for both Africa and the Arab world – beating European football giants like Spain, Portugal, and Belgium. 

South African coach Rulani Mokwena is expected to lead Wydad at the tournament. They will face Manchester City and Juventus in Philadelphia, then play Al-Ain in Washington DC.

But Mokwena's job is at risk after a poor run, and his future at Wydad Casablanca remains uncertain.

Mokwena's agent, Steven Kabushnik, revealed details of a meeting with Wydad president Hicham Ait Menna amid growing speculation over the coach's position. Kabushnik confirmed that there is mutual support between Mokwena and the club's leadership.

“I told the president clearly – if you don't want Rulani, let us know, and we'll leave,” Kabushnik told Radio Mars, a sports radio outlet. “But if you want him, he will stay until the end of the season. We agreed that he will stay until then, and we'll part ways professionally.”

Kabushnik added that Mokwena would remain in charge for the final matches of the season.

“If you don't want to deal with some transportation issues, don't come to the game,"" Alex Lasry, CEO of the regional host committee for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, said Thursday during a panel at the Meadowlands Chamber of Commerce's annual tourism conference after explaining that his family takes no chances with traffic, joking that his father left the 1996 World Series Game 6 in the eighth inning to dodge the traffic.

Lasry also explained that there will be “probably none or close to no” parking at MetLife Stadium during the tournament.

“The World Cup is a massive security perimeter and a huge security risk so I would imagine there will be very limited parking if any at MetLife,” Lasry said at the chamber's Lyndhurst headquarters.

Instead, the host committee is setting up park and rides around New Jersey, “where people can park somewhere nearby” and then be shuttled to the stadium, he said.

Lasry said people should “price in the fact that transportation is going to be a lot” and that while the host committee is still waiting for final approval of its mobility plan from FIFA, it is hoping to make transportation to and from MetLife Stadium as “efficient and easy as possible.”

Lasry said when it comes to train crowds, the host committee wanted to make sure the event is not overly annoying to daily commuters, so that people can “get to work and do what they need to do” while others can “get to the games while not putting too much of a stress on the transit system.”

But the transit system will — almost certainly — be pushed to its limits.

Some 80,000 fans will be traversing to MetLife and more than 16,000 other people, like FIFA staff, volunteers and contractors, are estimated to work the eight games at the stadium.

If parking is limited, the vast majority of those people will likely rely on NJ Transit, which has designed a system of trains and buses to move 20,000 people an hour. That is double what it was 11 years ago when MetLife hosted the Super Bowl and experienced an unexpected onslaught of 35,000 riders after the game. But the World Cup is the biggest sports spectacle in the world and soccer fans — whether they're going to the game or not — will want to be near the excitement.

Figuring out how to transport those fans safely and efficiently to the matches and fan fests around the region is the job of the region's host committee and transportation partners, including NJ Transit, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Amtrak and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

As Lasry put it, FIFA is responsible for what happens inside the stadiums and the host committees handle everything else, meaning they are the boots-on-the-ground planners for organizing the World Cup, which will be played in 16 cities in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, with the final at MetLife.

With just about a year to go before the six-week tournament begins in June 2026, the New York-New Jersey host committee is waiting for final approval of its mobility plan from FIFA.

One major difference Lasry noted between the World Cup in 2026 and the 2014 Super Bowl debacle is that the final soccer match will likely be played in the afternoon to accommodate overseas viewership.

This, he said, should help spread out the crowds leaving the match instead of 80,000 people making a mad dash for trains, buses and shuttles.

“We will try to set up activations and things around the stadium to ensure that …. there's not just a massive rush of everyone trying to get on a train, everyone trying to get an Uber, everyone trying to get on a bus all at the same time,” Lasry said.

Ultimately, Lasry's message was this: Try not to “drive anywhere near the stadium on a match day because it's going to be a nightmare.”","{'href': 'https://www.northjersey.com', 'title': 'Bergen Record'}","soccer"

Les Reines du Foot went to lengths to fundraise for their trip to Tzaneen — from selling crepes at markets to posing nude for a calendar.

TZANEEN, SOUTH AFRICA — The stands of the soccer stadium buzzed with anticipation. Vuvuzelas honked like a chorus of drunk geese, and spectators chattered excitedly. The teams were about to take the pitch.

But first, match officials had some business to attend to. They hunched over a stack of passports, carefully checking the teams' credentials. ""We don't want to see underage players,"" one official explained gravely.

Welcome to the Grannies International Football Tournament, or GIFT, where you're never too old to play. But you may well be too young.


                Rossina Mathye, 84 (center), was one of the original Vakhegula Vakhegula players — the name for the team from Tzaneen means ""Grandmothers, Grandmothers."" ""Exercise is good for me,"" she says of her soccer career, which took her to the U.S. in 2010 to play in a special match for older women. Mathye, who has 10 grandchildren and is a great grandmother, no longer plays. ""My knees are sore, so I stopped,"" she says. ""Now I sit and watch. Now I'm one of their biggest supporters.""

Technically speaking, having grandchildren was optional, but the age requirement was strictly non-negotiable. Under 50? Go find your own stadium of adoring fans. This one was reserved for the nanas, the mamis, the vovos and the gogos.

And make no mistake: They came to compete.

Once the age checks were done, the opening bars to the FIFA anthem crackled through the stadium speakers, and the players filed onto the field, gripping the hands of the young local players escorting them. On one side stood Togo, dressed head to toe in highlighter yellow. On the other was the United States in white.

When the whistle blew, the Americans immediately surged forward. Within seconds, their left forward Pam Woodworth, 72, streaked past three Togolese defenders, white ponytail flopping. Before they could regroup, she fed the ball straight to the feet of her center forward, Sue ""Clip"" Clippinger, 78, who drove a hard, high shot into the left corner of the net. The crowd roared.


                Sue ""Clip"" Clippinger, 78 (in the white t-shirt), is the center forward for the New England Breakers. She's flanked by players from team Togo. ""We've got some of the best chemistry,"" Clippinger says of her team, adding ""I've gotten better at this than when I was 40.""

""Goooooooaaaalllll,"" screamed the commentator, a former South African professional player named Ishmael Maluleke. ""What a performance from Granny #4 of the USA. She's dangerous, I'm telling you, she is the USA's [Lionel] Messi.""

For most of the women playing in this tournament, this was a kind of adoration they never dreamed of achieving on the soccer field. Whether they came from rural Kenya or suburban France, many had grown up in worlds where soccer was for the boys. As adults, they had often swallowed their own ambitions to make space for the people who needed them: spouses and partners, children, grandchildren.


                ""Grannies"" were the stars of the field — and a big part of the crowd. The stadium was packed with gogos (the Zulu word for grandmothers, which is widely and affectionately used throughout southern Africa). Some brought their sewing along, some had a nap when needed, but all cheered loudly for their favorite teams.

Now, however, they were making up for lost time. For four days in early April, teams from seven countries converged on this small South African farming town.

""We are going to play ball,"" sang one South African team in Zulu as they entered the stadium on the tournament's opening day. ""The grannies are going to play soccer.""

Many of the teams who paraded into the stadium on that sticky, subtropical morning had traveled a great distance to be there. Two teams from Boston blinked back jetlag as they handed out mini American flags to the crowd. A French squad in blue tracksuits shuffled in behind a massive tricolore emblazoned with their team name: Les Reines du Foot. The queens of soccer.

But in many ways, few had come as far as the hometown team. In 2007, when a Tzaneen radio-host-turned-philanthropist named Beka Ntsanwisi, began organizing a soccer league for older women, the odds were stacked against her. 

Rossina Mathye, now 84, played on one of those early squads. In those days, she would put on her soccer shorts for practice and then, before leaving her house, tie an ankle-length wrap skirt around her waist. ""You see, in our culture … trousers are for men,"" she says. If the women wanted to play then ""they"" — the men — ""musn't see what's going on.""

As the gospel of granny soccer spread, its momentum became hard to contain. Teams sprouted in towns and villages across the region. In a nod to South Africa's beloved national teams, Bafana Bafana (Boys Boys) and Banyana Banyana (Girls Girls), the players called themselves Vakhegula Vakhegula — Grandmothers Grandmothers.

By the time South Africa hosted the World Cup in 2010, the Vakhegula were minor local celebrities. And their star was still rising. A few days after the final whistle, an all-star team of ""grannies"" boarded a flight for Boston. A group of American women had seen clips of them playing and invited them to compete in a tournament organized for older players.

Coming back from that trip, Ntsanwisi's head rattled with ideas. If Boston could host a championship like that, why not Tzaneen? Sure, it wasn't exactly an obvious choice — a scruffy farming town of about 15,000 people deep in pick-up truck country, boxed in on all sides by groves of orange and avocado trees, a 5 hour drive from the nearest major international airport in Johannesburg.

But then again, Ntsanwisi had built a soccer league from scratch, and now her players were traveling the world. Nothing felt impossible. So she made herself a promise. ""One day,"" she said, ""I'm going to host the World Cup."" For grannies, that is.

It took a decade, but in 2023, the inaugural GIFT kicked off at the soccer stadium down the road from Ntsanwisi's childhood home in the Tzaneen township of Nkowankowa, featuring teams from six countries.

The second edition of the Grannies International tourney in 2025 looked poised to be even bigger. Besides the Americans, the French, the Togolese and a dozen South African squads, teams from Kenya and Mozambique marched into Nkowankowa Stadium the first morning of the tournament. 

But one team was missing.


                After their bus broke down en route to the tournament, team Zambia hitchhiked to the stadium. Above: The team warms up after their delayed arrival.

As the opening ceremony began with a flurry of speeches, the bus carrying Team Zambia lurched to a stop by the side of the road in southern Zimbabwe, 200 miles away.

For more than 48 hours, captain Lillian Zungu had been trying to keep her squad's spirits high despite mounting obstacles. First, two days before the tournament, the bus organized by the Zambian government had set out several hours late. By the time they reached the border with Zimbabwe that night, it was closed.

With little other choice, the players slept in the bus. Another day passed driving through Zimbabwe, then another night. By the time they awoke on the third day — the first day of the tournament – ""we felt we are losing it, but we didn't want to give up,"" recalls Zungu, 54, and a chef by profession.

But now, less than an hour's drive from the South African border, it seemed their bus had done the giving up for them. It had broken down.

Zungu tried not to think of what could have been. In the months leading up to the tournament, her team had practiced together four times a week. The players were small and fast, with the quick footwork and breakaway speed to match. Watching them play together, Zungu swelled with pride. At times, she couldn't suppress a thought: Maybe they were good enough to win the whole thing.

But none of that mattered now. The tournament didn't care how hard they'd trained, and it certainly wasn't going to wait for them to find a mechanic in rural Zimbabwe. With stiff limbs, players descended from the bus.

One of the coaches stuck out his thumb.

Back in Nkowankowa, the matches got underway. After a nail biter 1-0 victory over Kenya, a team from South Africa threw their goalkeeper on their shoulders and carried her across the field, cheering. Maluleke, the former men's professional player, fired off commentary at the speed and cadence of an auctioneer. ""We're seeing the Maradona of France play today,"" he screamed during one match.

""We say, these women are getting old, they can no longer do certain things, let's leave them,"" says Honorine Kobara Adjoa, the captain of Femme Foot Togo. ""But here they are giving everything of themselves. Being here, it's so motivating.""

Here, for the first time, she was surrounded by soccer-playing women from all over the world. And all of them seemed to share the same wonder she felt, even if they often had few words in common to express it.

But there were other shared languages. After games, players pulled their opponents into sweaty hugs. In the stands, they scrunched together for selfies like teenagers. Every so often, one of the South African teams would spontaneously burst into song, dragging everyone in earshot into an impromptu dance party.

""Once one person starts dancing, everybody tries to follow the dance,"" says Deb Keohan, the captain of the New England Breakers, an offshoot of the American squad that had invited Vakhegula Vakhegula to Boston a decade before. ""And then we were all dancing together. We didn't speak any language in common other than dancing.""


                The Mutei Grannies from Kenya celebrate at the end of their game with the French team Le Reines du Foot — the first of the tournament's quarter finals. After the match, both teams embraced.

For many of the players, soccer had also been there at other moments when words failed them. After deaths and divorces, through illness and financial uncertainty, the game was something they could disappear into when the world felt like it was collapsing around them.

When Mathye, the player from the original Vakhegula Vakhegula squad, lost her oldest son in 2015, she sat at home tormented, unable to escape his memory. But when she stepped onto a soccer field, for a few minutes the game shoved her sorrow offstage. Playing demanded her full attention, body and mind.

""You see the ball,"" she said, ""not the trouble.""

In the grandstands in Nkowankowa, few people had to be told the importance of grandmothers.

On the third day of the tournament, I met Muhluri Mayimele, 17, and her friends. She told me she was a soccer player herself, and hoped to learn some new moves from the players. When I asked about Mayimele's own grandmother, the teenager explained that she lived with her, and ""she teaches me life.""

Mayimele is hardly an outlier. Approximately 40% of all South African children live with their grandparents according to government statistics from 2023, some 10 million in total.

Hidden inside those numbers is a long and painful history. For generations, Black South Africans lived under racist regimes that viewed them as little more than disposable cheap labor. Confined to impoverished villages and townships, many left home seeking jobs in ""white"" cities and towns.

Men frequently went to work in the country's booming gold mines. But women's work was typically domestic. They cleaned, cooked, and raised other people's children, while at home, their own mothers raised theirs.

Fikile Sithole, who was raised by her gogo from the age of 7, says there was no more important person in her childhood. Her granny was ""a mother, a father, [and] a grandmother at the same time."" And when Sithole wanted to join a boys' soccer team in her neighborhood in Soweto, near Johannesburg, her grandmother didn't tell her that wasn't what girls did. She supported her.

Sithole went on to be part of the first women's national team in a democratic South Africa in the 1990s, an accomplishment she credits to the woman who raised her. She is ""why I am where I am today,"" she explained. ""Why I am a strong woman.""

Now in her mid-50s, Sithole is still playing. In the Grannies International, her team, the Mbombela Gogos, stormed its way to the semi-finals with a style of dance-like footwork and short, quick passes known in South Africa as ""shoeshine and piano.""

""We play, we move, we travel,"" she said. ""It's going to take us a long time to get old.""

On the final afternoon of the tournament, a row of trophies stood at attention on a table at midfield.

One by one, an announcer began calling up the women whose play had marked the tournament — its top goal scorer, its most promising player. Then he came to the award for the top midfielder.


                Nomsa Mashego, a 58-year-old grandmother of 2, is a member of South Africa's Mbombela team. She won the ""most promising player of the tournament."" Mashego has been playing soccer for 10 years. In 2006 she was partially paralyzed after a stroke and she says that her arms and leg are now 100% ""because I play ball."" Thinking of her own mortality, she says, ""It's better to play ball than go to ground,"" she says.

""It's Lillian from Zambia!"" he exclaimed, and suddenly the entire Zambian squad was on its feet. There they were: the team that almost didn't make it at all, yelling their lungs out for the woman who had been their playmaker, on and off the field.

After hitching rides to the border in passing mini-bus taxis, the team had arrived in Tzaneen at 10 p.m. on the first day of play, long after their scheduled match. But the organizers agreed to squeeze the game in the following morning, and the show went on.

The Zambians played two hard-fought games and narrowly missed out on a quarterfinal berth.

...

FIFA, soccer's global governing body, on Thursday delivered fans a “first-of-its-kind offer” to the 2025 Club World Cup, which will debut in the United States this summer, with ticket packs that include “guaranteed” access to the 2026 men's World Cup — the grander international tournament that will also be held in the U.S. a year later.

Per the “Terms of Sale” document, here's how it works:

Buyers of a standard “pack,” which features tickets to two or three Club World Cup matches, “will be granted a guaranteed option to buy one ticket to a FIFA World Cup 26 match in the United States (excluding the final),” FIFA said in a Thursday release.

In clause 4.2 of the Terms of Sale, is that FIFA can determine which 2026 World Cup match(es), and what type of ticket(s), the fan will have access to. Clause 2.4 also says: ""Tickets available to be included within Ticket Packages shall be subject to availability and available for purchase on a first-come first-served basis. By way of these Terms of Sale, FIFA Ticketing makes no guarantees as to the availability of Tickets and any indication on the availability of Tickets by FIFA Ticketing is for guidance purposes.""

First, fans mustn't resell those tickets, and must actually use them — meaning they or a family member or friend must go to the game. They will then be offered the chance to buy a 2026 World Cup ticket — match and seat specifics to be revealed later.

The second offering is the “Super Ticket Pack.” This package “features one ticket per match to 20 FIFA Club World Cup 2025 matches,” and then “a guaranteed option to buy one ticket” to the 2026 World Cup final, the most prestigious event in all of sports.

The buyer of a “super ticket pack” must “use all [20] tickets to attend all [20] matches,” and the matches must be on 20 different days. (There are only 22 distinct Club World Cup matchdays.)

Alternatively, per the terms, they could share the pack with “guests” — someone with whom they're “capable of demonstrating a pre-existing relationship.” Those guests could attend some of the 20 matches in their place. Among the fans and their guests, they'd get the right to buy one 2026 World Cup ticket.

Ticket prices for 2026 have not yet been announced, and tickets won't go on sale until the fall. FIFA has closely guarded all details.

Ticket prices for the 2025 Club World Cup, meanwhile, are roughly the same as they were when first released in December, both on Ticketmaster and within this “ticket pack” promotion via FIFA. “Category 1” seats — those in lower levels — cost anywhere from $100 to upward of $200, before taxes and fees, in the group stage; they cost $2,600, plus taxes and fees, for the final.

“Category 2” seats — typically those in a stadium's upper deck along the sideline — range from roughly $60 to $140 before taxes and fees in the group stage. Some cheaper tickets have been sold to supporters of the participating clubs.

However, the prices are far higher than those charged by the biggest European soccer clubs and have caused some consternation among fans. Bailey Brown, president of the Independent Supporters Council, a group representing soccer fans across the U.S. and Canada, told Yahoo Sports in December that she was worried that “many of the most passionate fans will be priced out of enjoying the sport.”

With two months of the opener, between Inter Miami and Al Ahly at Hard Rock Stadium in South Florida, many seats remain available.

In an effort to sell them, FIFA president Gianni Infantino has been holding promotional events alongside soccer dignitaries and celebrities.

Last month, he leveraged his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump to bring the Club World Cup trophy into the Oval Office, and leave it there on display. He used a media session alongside Trump to pump up the tournament and place it on par with the big World Cup.

Infantino's Instagram account is with filled posts promoting the Club World Cup. FIFA and its partners, in messages to everyone from soccer fans to NFL season ticket holders, have been marketing the event as “the most prestigious club soccer tournament in history.” They have been telling stakeholders that it will be “as big as the last [men's] World Cup,” according to multiple people who've heard FIFA's pitch.

After attempting to drum up interest, FIFA and Infantino ultimately struck a global broadcast deal with DAZN, which soon thereafter announced an equivalent investment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.

And so, after years of uncertainty, the Club World Cup is happening. It will pay out $1 billion in appearance fees and prize money to the 32 participating clubs.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

The global soccer community has been abuzz in recent weeks over a bold proposal to expand the 2030 FIFA World Cup to 64 participating nations. While the idea has garnered interest from some federations, a strong voice from Asia has publicly criticized CONMEBOL President Alejandro Domínguez's suggestion to FIFA.

The 2030 World Cup will mark the tournament's centennial, a landmark edition set to be co-hosted by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, with Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay staging the opening matches to honor the competition's South American origins. During the 80th Ordinary Congress of CONMEBOL, Dominguez pitched the expansion as a one-time celebration of the tournament's global legacy.

“We are convinced that the celebration of the centenary will be something unique, because only once is 100 years old. And that is why we are proposing for the only time, to carry out this anniversary with 64 teams, on three simultaneous continents. So that all countries have the opportunity to live a world experience, and so that no one on this planet is left out of this party that, although it is played everywhere, is our party,” Domínguez explained in the opening speech of the session.

The idea hasn't been universally welcomed. Sheikh Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa, president of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), strongly opposed the expansion during a media appearance.

“If the issue (of the number of participating teams) remains open to changes, the door won't just be open to an increase to 64 teams—someone might come and ask for 132. Where would it end? It would be chaos,” Al Khalifa said to the media.

He added emphatically: “Personally, I do not agree. The participation of 48 teams has already been approved.” He then shut down any possibility of further discussion. “The matter is closed,” he concluded.

Al Khalifa's remarks align with those of UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin, who has also spoken out against the proposed expansion. “I think it's a bad idea,” Ceferin said. “It's not good for the World Cup itself, and it's not good for our qualification phase either.”

FIFA, for its part, has remained noncommittal, acknowledging that it is reviewing the proposal without confirming President Gianni Infantino's position on the matter.

MUNICH - The reception that greeted Alexander Zverev in Munich on Saturday was nothing short of rapturous. Hundreds of fans crammed into the seats, walkways and even the grassy hills surrounding the practice court to catch a first glimpse of the top seed at the BMW Open by Bitpanda.After practice was done, Zverev looked relaxed, signing countless tennis balls and posing for selfies.“Really nice,” he smiled when asked about his first impressions of the venue this week. The historic event in Munich is undergoing a transformation following its upgrade to ATP 500 status. A new temporary Center Court has been erected for the next few years, as a new permanent version with retractable roof is completed.“I think that the Center Court is now very, very beautiful,” Zverev said on Saturday. “I think the court with the retractable roof will make a huge difference for the tournament and for the future of the tournament. But it's great to see that Munich is constantly developing, the facilities and the tournament itself.”

Zverev, who won the BMW Open twice in 2017 and 2018, has fond memories of Munich. The return to his home soil is the perfect opportunity to stop his recent dip in form. Since his defeat to Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open final, he has only won six matches, and will be displaced by Carlos Alcaraz as world No. 2 on Monday.""Of course I haven't played particularly well. I lost to a lot of guys that I should have beaten,"" he admitted.""I still believe I can play well on the big stage. I mean, I played in the Australian Open final three months ago. That said, I haven't forgotten how to do it. But yes, the last few weeks have been a bit more difficult, but I'm still very confident that I will play well now and hopefully in the next few weeks.""

Zverev is not the only player struggling for consistency in 2025. His nearest rival, Alcaraz, as well as Novak Djokovic, are among the opponents who have also suffered shock defeats since Melbourne.""Alcaraz is now in the final of Monte Carlo. That's a step forward for him. At the beginning of the year, you know who your competitors are. We've lost a lot since Australia, all of us.

“I have said very often that tennis is like any other sport and business. I didn't make the decision to play in South America after the Australian Open; I made that decision six or seven months before, and it wasn't the smartest decision to play in South America a week after the Australian Open on a different surface. That's clear to me,” he reflected.

The Italian was increasingly hobbled in the deciding set after 17 sets of tennis throughout six matches in the week.ByTENNIS.comPublished Apr 13, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 13, 2025

Carlos Alcaraz captured his sixth career ATP Masters 1000 title at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters on Sunday as Lorenzo Musetti faded physically in a disappointing end to a 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 final match.Musetti came into the match having lost his last three meetings with Alcaraz, never winning more than three games in any of the seven sets within those matches. And when he was broken from 30-15 to start the match, and faced three chances on Alcaraz's serve to trail 2-0, the start for the Italian was inauspicious. But a five-deuce game gave Musetti the break back, and he soared to four straight games against an increasingly erratic Alcaraz, on his way to winning his first set against the Spaniard since beating him to win the ATP 500 in Hamburg in 2022.After a second-set blitz, as Alcaraz rounded into form, Musetti became increasingly hobbled early in the deciding set, notably grimacing off the back of a missed forehand groundstroke early on.He later received a medical timeout on his upper right leg after dropping serve to trail 3-0, but was heavily restricted in his movement. He ultimately chose to play out the match despite being unable to move faster than walking pace. Alcaraz won 12 of the last 14 points.”It is not the way I would have wanted to win a match,"" Alcaraz said afterwards. ""Thinking about Lorenzo, he has been through a tough week, played long matches. I feel sorry for him. It is one of his best results, ending up like this is not easy. Hopefully it is nothing serious and he will be 100% soon.”

Carlos Alcaraz came from a set down to beat Lorenzo Musetti and win the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time.

The four-time major champion produced some superb shots to overcome the Italian 3-6 6-1 6-0 on the clay.

It was a competitive match for a set and a half before Musetti, bidding for the biggest prize of his career, began to struggle with a leg injury.

The success was a sixth ATP Masters 1000 trophy for Alcaraz - his first since Indian Wells last year - and an 18th title overall.

It also gives the 21-year-old a confidence boost before he defends his French Open title in May.

""It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations,"" Alcaraz said.

""I'm really proud of my myself how I've dealt with everything. It's been a really difficult month for me on the court and outside.

""Coming here and seeing how the whole hard work has paid off, I'm really happy.""

Alcaraz, as he has done for most of the week, made a wayward start.

An early break lead was cancelled out by Musetti, who reeled off four games in a row as Alcaraz sprayed errors off his forehand. 

Musetti's accuracy won out over his opponent's pacy hitting, with the Italian clinching the set on an outrageous drop-shot winner from behind the baseline.

Alcaraz hit 14 unforced errors in the first set, 11 off the forehand alone, but settled quickly into the second.

A roar of ""vamos"" greeted a missed Musetti forehand that handed Alcaraz the break lead, with the Spaniard moving around the court with more conviction and asking the crowd for appreciation after hitting a superb backhand winner.

He won five games in a row but Musetti had a glimmer of a chance. He created five break-back points as Alcaraz served for the set, but the second seed saved them all, ultimately closing out an eight-minute game to force a deciding third set.

That was barely competitive, though, as Musetti was hindered by a right thigh injury, needing treatment after going 3-0 down, and could barely move.

Alcaraz promptly whizzed through the set, raising his arms in celebration before consoling Musetti.

The victory also means Alcaraz will replace Germany's Alexander Zverev as world number two when the rankings are updated on Monday.

Later, British pair Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool were beaten 1-6 7-6 (10-8) 10-8 in the men's doubles final by home favourite Romain Arneodo and France's Manuel Guinard.

Carlos Alcaraz and Lorenzo Musetti were on the cusp of huge rankings milestones ahead of their Monte Carlo final – and they weren't the only players impacted by action this week.

Here, we look at the rankings winners and losers from the first Masters 1000 of the clay swing.

1) Jannik Sinner, 10,330
2) Alexander Zverev, 7,645
3) Carlos Alcaraz, 6,720
4) Taylor Fritz, 5,290
5) Novak Djokovic, 4,510
6) Jack Draper, 3,780
7) Casper Ruud, 3,765
8) Stefanos Tsitsipas, 3,445
9) Andrey Rublev, 3,440
10) Alex de Minaur, 3,335

Despite not playing due to his three-month suspension, Sinner's lead heading into Monte Carlo was so significant he was ensured of staying at No 1 – despite dropping 400 semi-final points from 2024.

This event was a must-win for Zverev's hopes of replacing Sinner as No 1 ahead of the Italian's comeback, while the battle for No 2 was between the German and world No 3 Alcaraz.

With semi-final points to defend, world No 5 Djokovic needed a good result to boost his hopes of a return to the top four – with world No 4 Fritz out of the event due to injury.

Only 345 points separated world No 6 Draper and world No 10 de Minaur, meaning there was plenty of room for manoeuvre inside and around the top 10.

That was particularly so for world No 8 Tsitsipas and world No 7 Ruud, the champion and finalist from Monte Carlo a year ago.

1) Jannik Sinner, 9,930
2) Carlos Alcaraz, 7,720
3) Alexander Zverev, 7,595
4) Taylor Fritz, 5,280
5) Novak Djokovic, 4,120
6) Jack Draper, 3,780
7) Alex de Minaur, 3,535
8) Andrey Rublev, 3,490
9) Daniil Medvedev, 3,290
10) Casper Ruud, 3,215

Though he has dropped 400 points, Sinner still has a significant lead as the world No 1 thanks to Zverev's second-round exit to Matteo Berrettini.

But, following his run to the final, Alcaraz has boosted his points tally significantly – and has now usurped Zverev as the world No 2.

Djokovic's opening-match exit has seen him drop 390 points and fall over 1,000 points behind Fritz in the race for a top four seeding at Roland Garros.

However, the good news for the Serbian is that no one was able to take advantage of his early exit and push him down the ATP Rankings.

Most notably, Tsitsipas will fall out of the top 10 after his quarter-final exit to Musetti, while Ruud is also at risk of leaving the top 10 – having already fallen to world No 10 in the live rankings.

De Minaur's run to the semi-final sees him move back up to world No 7.

At the very top of the ATP Rankings, this has been a significant week for Alcaraz, who has boosted his points ahead of his French Open defence at the end of the clay swing – and has jumped up one place.

Inside the top 10, the biggest winner in terms of movement is de Minaur, who is projected to rise three spots to world No 7 on 3,535 points.

Meanwhile, runner-up Musetti is projected to rise five places to world No 11 after reaching his first Masters 1000 final.

Arthur Fils is set to rise one place to a new high of world No 14, while Grigor Dimitrov is set to move back up one place to world No 17.

Lower down the rankings, there is good news for beaten semi-finalist Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who is projected to rise 12 places to world No 30, while Daniel Altmaier is set to rise 16 spots to world No 68.

Once again, Zverev has failed to take significant advantage of Sinner's absence – and now will lose his world No 2 ranking if Alcaraz wins Sunday's final.

However, there can be no doubt that the biggest loser from a rankings perspective is defending Monte Carlo champion Tsitsipas.

Ranked eighth heading in, the Greek is projected to fall eight places to world No 16 thanks to his quarter-final exit, his lowest ranking since 2018.

2024 finalist Ruud is also set to drop three places to world No 10, though he has managed to stay inside the top 10 thanks to Musetti's defeat in the final.

Spanish star comes back from a set down to beat Musetti 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 as he gears up to defend his title at Roland Garros.

Carlos Alcaraz has overcome a slow start to beat an injury-stricken Lorenzo Musetti 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 in the Monte Carlo Masters final, clinching his first title at the prestigious clay-court event and gaining momentum going into next month's French Open.

The Spaniard dropped his opening two service games and struggled to find his range early on Sunday, particularly on his usually reliable forehand, as Musetti took full advantage to claim the first set.

But Alcaraz responded with a dominant display in the second, winning five straight games to take control of the match.

His physical power and improved shot selection proved too much for the Italian world number 16, who was seeking his first Masters 1000 title.

Alcaraz broke in the first and third games of the deciding set, maintaining his grip on the contest to seal victory in the first major European clay-court event of the season.

Musetti started showing signs of a right-leg injury in the third set and received treatment at 0-3. Playing in his first Masters 1000 final, the 23-year-old Italian had trouble moving and keeping up with Alcaraz towards the end of the match.

“This is not the way I want to win a match. I really feel sorry for him,” Alcaraz said.

“Just really happy to have won the Monte Carlo for the first time. It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations. I'm really proud of myself, how I dealt with everything.”

Alcaraz has struggled at times this year and was coming off an opening-round loss to David Goffin in Miami.

It was Alcaraz's third consecutive clay-court final after winning the French Open and finishing with a silver medal at the Paris Olympics last year.

Alcaraz was playing in his 23rd tour-level final and will move up a place in the rankings and displace Alexander Zverev at number two.

Some consolation for Musetti is a rise to 11th in the rankings and the promise of more to come on the clay as the season builds towards the French Open at Roland Garros.

“It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,” he said.

“I'm disappointed I couldn't finish the match in the best way for the crowd. You deserve it, so I will keep going and try and come back for revenge.”

Listen to Story

Carlos Alcaraz issued a warning to the rest of the men's singles circuit ahead of next month's French Open, clinching the Monte Carlo Masters title for the first time in his career on Sunday, 13 April. Alcaraz overcame Lorenzo Musetti in three sets, fighting back from a set down against the Italian, who struggled with injury in the final two sets in Monte Carlo.

The 21-year-old became the first Spaniard since Rafael Nadal in 2018 to win the prestigious clay-court Masters 1000 title. It marked Alcaraz's second title of 2025 and his first Masters 1000 crown in 13 months, as the youngster signalled a return to peak form.

After losing the opening set 3-6 to Musetti, Alcaraz roared back. Some of his trademark forehand winners were on display as he found his rhythm in the second set. In a dazzling display of shot-making, Alcaraz played a 'fake forehand slice' that completely wrong-footed Musetti. There were several jaw-dropping winners from the Spaniard, showcasing his flair and confidence on clay.So satisfying @carlosalcaraz with the forehand fake slice!#RolexMonteCarloMasters pic.twitter.com/IvJ0DltIbZ— Tennis TV (@TennisTV) April 13, 2025

Alcaraz won the first five games of the second set and went a double break up early in the decider, denying Musetti a dream finish in Monte Carlo.ALCARAZ BOUNCES BACK IN STYLE

""I am really happy to win Monte Carlo for the first time. It has been a really difficult week with a lot of tough moments,"" Alcaraz said.

""I'm proud of how I handled everything. It's been a challenging month for me, so coming here and seeing the hard work pay off makes me very happy,"" he added.

Alcaraz had a testing start to the season, bowing out in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open. He then suffered a shock second-round exit at the Miami Open, a Masters 1000 event on hard court. However, a return to clay appears to have revitalised his game.

With the win, Alcaraz will climb to No. 2 in the ATP men's singles rankings, due to be updated on Monday, 14 April. He will leapfrog Alexander Zverev, reaching a tally of 7,720 points. Jannik Sinner, currently serving a doping ban, remains in top spot.Published By: Akshay RameshPublished On: Apr 13, 2025

It will take some going for Carlos Alcaraz to match Rafael Nadal's record of 11 Monte Carlo Masters titles but his triumph on Sunday will surely be the first of several to come in the principality.

This is the first European clay-court swing for 21 years in which there is no discussion about Nadal's prospects. It took the retirement of the “King of Clay” last November for the narrative at this time of the season to finally focus on others.

Alcaraz will play a major part in that conversation over the coming years. With Jannik Sinner still serving a drugs ban and Novak Djokovic struggling for consistency by his lofty standards, the 21-year-old Spaniard took his chance for a first Monte Carlo trophy by defeating Italy's Lorenzo Musetti 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 in the final. He is the youngest player to win here since Nadal's fourth Monte Carlo title at the age of 21 in 2008.

There are still six weeks before the French Open gets under way but this result already has some ramifications for the second grand-slam tournament of the year. Alcaraz replaces Alexander Zverev as the world No2 and will almost certainly still be there when he arrives as the defending champion at Roland Garros in late May. This means that he can play Sinner, the world No1, no earlier than the final as they will be in opposite halves of the draw.

If the rankings were to be done subjectively based on clay alone, Alcaraz would probably top the list at present. He has reached the final of each of his past three tournaments on the red stuff, finishing runner-up to Djokovic at last year's Paris Olympics in between his French Open and Monte Carlo victories.

This Masters title also feels like a significant step forward for Alcaraz, who had not claimed a trophy at the series of tournaments below the four grand-slam events since the Indian Wells Open in March 2024. Intriguingly there was also a hint towards an undisclosed off-court issue in recent weeks.

“I am really happy to win Monte Carlo for the first time,” Alcaraz said. “It has been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations. I am proud with how I dealt with everything. It has been a difficult month for me on the court and outside, so coming here and seeing the hard work pay off makes me happy.”

Alcaraz was not at his best in Monte Carlo but he still had more than enough talent in his locker to come through five matches, three of which went to three sets. On Sunday he made a slow start against Musetti, with 11 of 14 unforced errors coming from the forehand side.

Musetti, the 23-year-old who had both a first Masters title and entry to the top ten at stake, had come back from a set down in four of his previous five matches en route to the final and these exertions had a noticeable impact in the final. After winning the first set against Alcaraz he suddenly ran out of steam and required treatment on his right thigh. The momentum quickly shifted, with Alcaraz winning 12 of the last 13 games.

“It is not the way I would have wanted to win a match,” Alcaraz said. “Thinking about Lorenzo, he has been through a tough week, played long matches. I feel sorry for him. It is one of his best results, ending up like this is not easy. Hopefully it is nothing serious and he will be 100 per cent soon.”

Alcaraz now heads back to Spain for this week's Barcelona Open, followed by the Madrid Open next week. The Italian Open in Rome from May 7 could then host a reunion with Sinner, who is scheduled to make a competitive return on home soil from his three-month ban.

Meanwhile, Great Britain's Billie Jean King Cup team will discover their opponents in September's finals when the draw is made on May 12. Anne Keothavong's team claimed back-to-back victories over Germany and the Netherlands in the qualifiers in the Hague on Friday and Saturday to seal a place in the eight-team showpiece event in Shenzhen, China, alongside the likes of Italy and Spain.

Martina Navratilova played many different opponents in her 23 appearances at the Wimbledon Championships.

Navratilova won 18 Grand Slam singles titles in her career, with half of those coming at the Wimbledon Championships.

Of her nine victories at SW19, five of them came in a final where Navratilova beat greatest rival Chris Evert.

Evert and Navratilova had many battles over the years, but there was another legendary player that she wishes should could have played on the Wimbledon grass.

Ahead of the 2018 Wimbledon women's singles final between Serena Williams and Angelique Kerber, which the latter won, Navratilova spoke about the one player that she wishes she could have played at The Championships.

Writing in her London Evening Standard Column, Navratilova declared that her dream match would be to play Williams at Wimbledon.

Navratilova even went onto explain what her tactics would have been to beat Williams, as she suggested that she would back herself to win.

“If I could pick to play any one single player from another generation it would be Serena Williams at Wimbledon, no question,” said Navratillova.

“It would have been the dream match for me to test my serve and volley against her power game, although it would never have been enough to just serve and volley as she loves a target.

“The only answer is to try to mix it up, but the power she possesses is something to contend with. For me, it would have been an interesting match-up and the competitor in me would have fancied my chances!”

There was one Wimbledon singles tournament that both Navratilova and Williams were part of in 2004, but both players would have had to reach the final to make it happen.

Williams did managed to do just that, while 47-year-old Navratilova lost in the second round to Gisela Dulko in her final ever singles match at Wimbledon.

While they never played each other on a singles court, Navratilova and Williams did go head-to-head at the Wimbledon doubles tournament in 2000.

In this quarter-final match, Serena partnered sister Venus Williams to beat Navratilova and Mariaan de Swardt, 4-6 6-2 6-1, en route to winning the title.

Navratilova has won more Wimbledon singles titles than any other player in history with nine, that includes winning six consecutive titles between 1982 and 1985.

The former number one won her final singles title 1990, eight years before Williams made her Wimbledon debut.

Williams lost in the third round of Wimbledon on her Wimbledon debut in 1998, before winning her first title in 2002. 

The last Wimbledon title of Williams' career came in 2016, but she appeared in two more finals after this point.

It was 2019 where she played her last Wimbledon final, with Williams losing to Simona Halep in just 56 minutes.

Williams made her final Wimbledon appearance in 2022, losing in the first round to Frenchwoman Harmony Tan.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

For Serena Williams, slowing down isn't in her vocabulary. With 23 Grand Slams and 73 career singles titles, she's a perpetual motion machine. You'd expect a legend like that to take a breather after retirement, right? Nope. Serena juggles multiple ventures even after bidding adieu to tennis. One minute she's a venture capitalist with Serena Ventures, the next, she's conquering the beauty and fashion world. Just when you think she's reached her peak, she drops Wyn Beauty, a makeup line tailored for women in constant motion. Though launched post Serena's retirement, it's fair to wonder if these ventures were years in the making.

On April 2, Serena marked a major milestone in her post-professional tennis career. The 23-time Grand Slam champion celebrates one year since her makeup label, WYN Beauty, was launched in April 2024. To commemorate this occasion, the brand hosted a two-day pop-up event in Los Angeles on April 11 and April 12!

Speaking to Shopify, Serena revealed how her idea for Wyn Beauty came about. She said, “The moment I knew I wanted to start WYN was when I was in the locker room at Wimbledon and I was putting sun cream in my hand and then I was putting foundation and I was mixing it together to make my own skin tint. And I thought, ‘I need to have something in my color. Also need to have this product. Is there a way I could use this while I'm playing or while I'm just using it all 24 hours throughout the day?”

Williams has a total of seven Wimbledon titles over two decades. But amidst her dominance on court, she was also planning her entrepreneurial ventures. She noted how she wanted to change the beauty game for people of color to be more included. “That's when I knew it didn't exist, and I needed to create something new. We've been doing this for over seven years. This is our one-year anniversary,” she added.

The pop-up events celebrating Wyn Beauty's anniversary featured a shade-matching station to provide every visitor with their perfect match from the 36 inclusive shades available. This journey began seven years ago, around 2017, when Serena was fresh off her Australian Open victory and celebrating the birth of her first child, Olympia. To think that ‘Wyn Beauty' was in the making even then.

The brand wasn't a snap decision. For over six years, Serena envisioned a beauty brand mirroring her own powerhouse spirit: strong, active, and resilient. This vision came to life through a partnership with The Good Glamm Group, bringing 91 shades across ten high-performance products to the US. But getting there was a marathon, not a sprint.

“Lots of dedication, lots of tears and lots of happiness. I think in sport, you know when you win you either are shaking your opponent's hand or you're pumping your fist or something. In business, I feel like you know you've won just by the fact that people really love and enjoy it, but also the impact that you're making in different people's lives,” Serena noted.

From Grand Slams to glam shades, is Serena Williams the ultimate role model for reinvention?

Debate

And it's not just the fans that love the product; many within the tennis community actively show their adoration for her brand!

Serena Williams lit up Miami Beach with an exclusive TikTok collaboration event celebrating her beauty brand, Wyn Beauty. Taking to Instagram, she shared the excitement through reposts and videos. Nicholas Monaco, Miami's stage manager, honored her as “the one and only Serena Williams.”

The women passionately cheered for the brand, while Serena introduced new Wyn Beauty products. Adding flair, she danced alongside digital creator The Achieng Agutu to Have You Seen My Wife, while showing off the latest launches. The energy was electric, from glamorous makeup rooms to Serena's grand stage entrance.

Carlos Alcaraz won his first Monte Carlo Masters title on Sunday with a 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 victory over the Italian Lorenzo Musetti.

It marks a sixth Masters title for the 21-year-old Spaniard, a four-time Grand Slam winner, and his most prestigious title since winning Wimbledon last year.




""I'm just really happy to have won Monte Carlo for the first time,"" said Alcaraz who lost in his first match on his only previous appearance at the tournament in 2022.

""It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations.




""I'm really proud of myself how I've dealt with everything. It's been a really difficult month for me on the court and outside.

""Coming here and seeing how the whole hard work has paid off, I'm really happy.""

Alcaraz, who will move up a place in the rankings and displace Alexander Zverev at No. 2, had to come from behind to beat the Italian, who had already taken down two Top 10 players, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur, on his way to his first Masters 1000 final.

Musetti dropped his opening service but then fought his way back into the first set as Alcaraz appeared at odds with his game.




The Spaniard bounced back, however, lifting his game as he galloped through the second set 6-1.

That trend continued as Musetti began to have problems with his right leg, receiving treatment when he was 0-3 in the decider.

He battled on but could not live with the intensity or physicality of Alcaraz's game.

""Lorenzo's been through a really tough week, long and intense matches,"" said Alcaraz.

""I feel sorry for him, one of the best results he has done, to end like this is not easy. Hopefully it's not serious and he's 100% soon.""

Some consolation for Musetti is a rise to No. 11 in the rankings and the promise of more to come on the clay as the season builds towards the French Open at Roland Garros next month.

""It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,"" he said.

""I'm disappointed I couldn't finish the match in the best way, for the crowd. You deserve it so I will keep going and try and come back for revenge.""","{'href': 'https://www.dailysabah.com', 'title': 'Daily Sabah'}","tennis"

In a daring development that shocked the tennis world, Stefanos Tsitsipas is going to name former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic as his next coach. After Roland Garros, the Greek star should technically kick off this significant collaboration, according to the Greek sports outlet Gazzetta.

Long under the direction of his father, Apostolos Tsitsipas, the Greek tennis star broke the headlines in August 2024 by demanding his father step out of the coaching box during the Canadian Open match. That controversy altered their longstanding working relationship, finally leading Apostolos to step down. Since then, Greece's Davis Cup captain, Dimitris Chatzinikolaou, has assumed the coaching responsibilities.

Stefanos Tsitsipas is clearly searching for a new direction after negotiating some difficult terrain on the ATP Tour recently. Including Grand Slam winner and seasoned coach Goran Ivanisevic, who played an important role in Novak Djokovic's strong run, the Greeks' desire to reset and recharge is illustrated. Ivanisevic's return to the ATP Tour via this new partnership provides an intriguing twist to the season, even if he had quit coaching after his split with Djokovic in 2024.

Tsitsipas has usually been in the top 10 of the ATP rankings, and his goal is to maintain that level at the minimum before striving for more. Although he did have a major win at the ATP 500 in Dubai earlier this year, the Greek athlete is under pressure to defend crucial points during the clay season. He lost to Lorenzo Musetti and lost his Monte Carlo crown but has more points to defend at the Barcelona Open.

Goran Ivanisevic has proven his coaching skills at the highest level and is a well-known name in tennis history. Over his almost five-year run with Ivanisevic, Djokovic won 12 Grand Slam championships under his mentorship. Tsitsipas' ability to emphasize the best of an already gifted player is what he may need to discover his top level of play.

Earlier in the year, Ivanisevic joined the camp of 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina. Their deal ended quite suddenly; however, off-court problems associated with Rybakina's former coach Stefanos Vukov's controversial return came up. Ivanisevic described the episode as pathetic and unusual. Only some weeks into their work, they had chosen to part ways. The former left-handed player refused to provide details about this dramatic episode.

This new coaching arrangement becomes especially compelling considering how it might affect Stefanos Tsitsipas' performances on the grass court. While he has been mostly successful on other courts, Wimbledon has remained a challenging ground for the Greek—he has never advanced beyond the fourth round. With a former Wimbledon winner like Ivanisevic by his side now, this might be Tsitsipas' best chance yet to rewrite his grass story.

The Greek's grass performance has been mediocre, though he captured a Mallorca grasscourt title in 2022. This could be a turning point since Ivanisevic knows a lot about strategic play and grasscourt nuances. The goal is clear: prepare Tsitsipas for a serious threat at the All England Club and for competitive play. It should be noted that Djokovic won four consecutive Wimbledon titles with Ivanisevic as coach.

Maybe Goran Ivanisevic's addition will motivate the Greek tennis star Stefanos Tsitsipas to resuscitate his career. By connecting himself with a coach familiar with the demands of Grand Slam tournaments and the nuances of grasscourt play, Tsitsipas is showing a drive to progress. For now, the focus is the clay court season, and the former Roland Garros runners-up has shown what it takes to excel on this surface.

Tennis fans were tizzy following the announcement that Daniil Medvedev will partner with teen sensation Mirra Andreeva in the mixed doubles for the 2025 US Open. This unexpected couple is a dramatic shift in the lead-up to the last Grand Slam of the year as both participants seek to put their act together following a disappointing show at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Andreeva, who last week won in Indian Wells and climbed to No. 7 in women's singles, told Sport-Express in an interview that she and Medvedev are determined to make their US Open adventure one to tell the tale about. The two had teamed up previously at the Olympics and the World Tennis League, although the result wasn't with them, and Andreeva was eager to use their chemistry and get the job done in New York.

Mirra Andreeva has also been causing ripples in singles and doubles circuits. She has had a great run with Diana Shnaider, and the duo is ranked second in the Race to the WTA Finals. Her doubles resume includes a WTA 500 title in Brisbane and the prized Miami Open victory, making her a force to be understood in both formats.

Conversely, more famous for his solitary court battles, Medvedev is less tested and seasoned in doubles competition. Although formerly a World No. 1 in singles and Grand Slam champion, he has never appeared in an ATP doubles final. However, teaming up with Andreeva indicates he will enter new territory and introduce another facet of his game.

The Russian duo first partnered at the 2024 Paris Olympics, where they were humiliated by a first-round defeat to Italy's Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori. The disappointment was immense, particularly given the hype with their maiden outing. However, instead of allowing the defeat to end their partnership, both players have decided to try it on the world's biggest stage.

Andreeva also sees the pairing as positive, mentioning that she believes they have the potential to be a fantastic team with enhanced coordination and planning. Daniil Medvedev has also talked about Andreeva's all-court style and believes their pairing could be one of the most interesting storylines in this year's US Open.

This year, the US Open sports a fresh face for its revamped mixed doubles, designed to maximize energy and viewer engagement. With more truncated sets—at four games per set and a tiebreaker at 3-3—the tournament risks being a high-drama showdown. With only 16 chosen teams competing, this adds a sheen of sophistication and increases the stakes.

This shift has attracted top players from both the ATP and WTA circuits. Daniil Medvedev and Mirra Andreeva were the initial ones to officially confirm their presence, with other high-profile names like Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa joining the fray. With a million dollars in prize money for the winning team, the competition is bound to be fierce.

With the 2025 US Open just around the corner, the Daniil Medvedev and Mirra Andreeva pairing will be one of the tournament's most compelling narratives. Merging experience and youth, power and finesse, their pairing is as astute a tactical move as it echoes modern tennis's evolving dynamics. Whether they take home the title, they'll give some historic performances in the mixed doubles event.

The sport's manufacturers brace for the impact of the new tariffs and their ripple effects on players and the broader market.ByJon LeveyPublished Apr 13, 2025 copy_link

There could be some pain.That's the unfortunate forecast for avid recreational tennis players. As with just about every commercial industry, the sport's equipment will be significantly impacted by the second Trump administration's tariff plan. With racquet, shoes, balls and strings virtually all made overseas, the costs to buy new gear and play the game are almost certain to rise.Even before the latest tariff hike announced on April 2 and amended on April 9, a few brands had already taken steps to address higher production costs facing the industry. Both Head and Wilson had raised the prices on their high-performance racquets by $10, so the $269 price tag for the new Head Gravity Tour that debuted in January, for example, is up to $279. But now that tariffs on imports from China—where all major brands other than Yonex make their racquets—currently stand at 125%, that may just be the first pass.“At the end of the day, my gut feeling is it will have a very negative impact,” says Jeff Bardsley, Head's vice president of racquet sports. “We're doing as much as we can to push it off, but when it starts to impact the bottom line, the next question then becomes what are you going to do to reduce that impact.”

Cushioning such a blow generally falls to price increases—which we're already seeing—or cost-cutting, which brands prefer to use as a last resort. Before the latest round of tariffs, Bardsley estimated that Head was looking at a potential $7 million hit to their 2025. That number could be optimistic.About half of that shortfall was attributed to their ball business. Head, which makes Penn balls, is the only major manufacturer that still produces balls in China. They have designs on getting a new factory up and running in the Philippines, but a full transition could take around two years. The company is willing to take the hit and keep their ball prices static in order to keep pace with the likes of Wilson and Dunlop who manufacture their balls in other Asian countries. But now that there's a minimum across-the-board tariff to all imports, ball prices could be fair game as well.

Part of the challenge is the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs themselves. Tennis equipment had already been subjected to tariffs, which are baked into the prices manufacturers set when gear is put on shelves. Experiencing major hikes in the middle of the year is disruptive. It's an open question whether current levels will remain in place, experience escalation in the near future, or get repealed altogether.It puts manufacturers in a precarious position. Several are opting for patience amidst the volatility.“From our standpoint, we're taking a wait-and-see approach,” says KT Kim, director of Solinco Sports. “We don't want to go through the trouble of changing all the prices and then the situation changes overnight. If something changes in China, it could come off. If it doesn't, we'll have to react as well.”

Another worry for manufacturers is if and when there is relief from the current tariff rates, will their products be included? The first Trump administration is when the industry experienced the first tariff increase on balls. When the Biden administration took control, it kept them in place and it became the new normal. Similarly, racquet bags were hit hard during this period and prices never recovered. The brands may absorb some of the burden, but much of it will have to be passed on to the consumer.But as much as manufacturers are concerned with the impact on their equipment sales, their just as fearful of the potential chilling effect the tariffs could have on participation. Buying new gear and playing tennis is something people want, but don't necessarily need. When consumer purchasing power is spread thinner for essentials, will it curb willingness to shell out for leisure activities? The potential could be detrimental to the long-term health of the sport.“This is going to be a real test,” Bardsley says. “When people are already paying more for the cost of gas, groceries and TVs, will they pay to play racquet sports?”

RACE START: Watch the getaway in Bahrain as Piastri holds the lead and Norris shoots up the order

GALLERY: Jackie Stewart drives 1973 title-winning Tyrrell in emotional demo run ahead of Bahrain GP

OFFICIAL GRID: Piastri heads mixed-up starting order as Russell and Antonelli drop places in Bahrain

AS IT HAPPENED: All the action from the 2025 Bahrain GP as Piastri takes victory

F2: Dunne dominates Sakhir Feature Race for maiden Formula 2 win

Oscar Piastri has become the first multiple race winner of the 2025 season by taking a sublime victory in the Bahrain Grand Prix, the Australian driver putting in a cool and collected drive to seal P1 on his 50th start in F1 as well as marking McLaren's first triumph in Sakhir.

After making a strong start from pole position – despite a close call from George Russell when the Mercedes driver locked up into Turn 1 – Piastri built a solid lead throughout the laps that followed.

While there was early trouble for team mate Lando Norris – who was hit with a five-second time penalty for being out of position in his grid box – the McLarens again looked impressive as the race played out, with the Briton working his way forwards.

And while Piastri's position potentially looked under threat when a Safety Car emerged, the 24-year-old made a clean getaway at the restart and went on to rebuild a gap in the laps that followed, eventually crossing the line with a 15-second lead.

Race results

Russell ultimately took second, holding off a thrilling late chase from Norris, though the Silver Arrows driver will be investigated after the Grand Prix for a potential DRS infringement. Norris was just 0.774s behind Russell at the finish, a good recovery from the McLaren racer after a difficult Qualifying on Saturday.

Charles Leclerc had to settle for fourth – despite putting up a good fight against Norris during a scrap for third in the latter stages – ahead of Ferrari team mate Lewis Hamilton in fifth, while Max Verstappen snatched sixth place in the final moments on what had been a tough evening for the Red Bull man, having experienced issues at both of his pit stops.

Pierre Gasly scored Alpine's first points of the campaign in seventh while Esteban Ocon followed in eighth, the Haas racer's strategy of an early pit stop seemingly paying off. Yuki Tsunoda took ninth for Red Bull, with Ollie Bearman adding to Haas' tally in 10th.

Norris overtook Leclerc in the latter stages before chasing after Russell

Kimi Antonelli just missed out in P11, the Mercedes rookie losing out after running in the points earlier in the event, while Alex Albon was the sole Williams to finish the race in P12. Nico Hulkenberg claimed P13 for Kick Sauber, ahead of Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar.

Jack Doohan ended the event in P15 as his search for his debut points of the season continues, with Fernando Alonso a disappointing P16 in the Aston Martin. Liam Lawson took P17, the Racing Bulls man having been hit with a 10-second penalty for causing a collision with Hulkenberg.

Lance Stroll and Gabriel Bortoleto were the final classified runners in 18th and 19th respectively, with Carlos Sainz the only retiree owing to damage sustained to his Williams after contact with Tsunoda.

Sainz was the only driver to retire from the race

One day on from an exciting Qualifying session – which saw Piastri storm to pole position for what will be his 50th race start in Formula 1 – the attentions of the paddock had turned to the 57-lap Bahrain Grand Prix.

Two changes to the starting order had been made in the hours after Saturday's session, with the Mercedes pair of Russell and Antonelli each receiving a one-place grid penalty for a rule breach during Qualifying.

Both cars were sent into the fast lane of the pit lane before a session restart time had been confirmed following a red flag period; as such, Russell dropped from P2 to P3 – promoting Leclerc up to the front row – while Antonelli moved from fourth to fifth, sending Gasly up to P4.

Following an emotional demo run by Sir Jackie Stewart on Sunday morning, with the 85-year-old taking to the track in his championship-winning Tyrrell 006, the drivers were greeted by warm temperatures in the range of 29 degrees Celsius as the cars started to assemble on the grid.

When the tyre blankets were removed, it was revealed that the majority of the pack would be starting on the soft compound. The exceptions to this were Leclerc, Hamilton, Alonso, Lawson and Bortoleto, all of whom had bolted on the medium rubber.

There was a close moment between Piastri and Russell as the Bahrain Grand Prix got underway

After the formation lap had been completed and the lights went out at 1800 local time, Piastri made a good launch off the line – but so did Russell, who leapt past Leclerc before locking up into Turn 1, coming perilously close to making contact with Piastri in the process.

Norris, meanwhile, enjoyed a spectacular start from P6, the Briton bouncing back from his Qualifying struggles to move up into third ahead of Leclerc. Gasly followed in fifth, while Norris' former team mate Sainz had also made gains, going from P8 to P6 in the Williams.

As Piastri stretched out a lead of more than one second from Russell up front, Antonelli was under increasing pressure from Verstappen in a scrap for seventh place. Elsewhere there was some concerning news for Norris, with the Briton noted by the stewards for a potential false start for being out of position on the grid.

Further back, Ocon and Albon had both gained two positions in P12 and P13 respectively, while Bearman looked in racy form after surging forward from last to P15. Bearman's former F2 team mate Antonelli, meanwhile, snatched sixth place from Sainz before Verstappen followed through to take seventh, the Dutchman being pushed slightly wide in the process while battling the Williams.

With the stewards investigating Norris' potential false start, replays highlighted that Verstappen reported that the McLaren was “way out of his grid box”. And just moments later, it was confirmed that a five-second time penalty had been issued to the Briton, who was continuing to run in third place.

“We will recover these positions,” Norris was told by his race engineer. Meanwhile, as Lap 9 ticked down, a thrilling duel was playing out between Sainz and Hamilton – the man who replaced him at Ferrari – over P8, the seven-time World Champion eventually muscling by before Tsunoda followed suit to push a struggling Sainz down to P10.

Norris headed into the pits on Lap 11 – where he also served his penalty, dropping him down to P14 after bolting on the medium tyres – while Gasly and Verstappen also made their stops for the medium and hard rubber respectively. Verstappen suffered a particularly slow stop, the World Champion emerging in P16.

Up at the front, Piastri remained in the lead by six seconds from Leclerc, with Hamilton, Sainz and Albon completing the top five, all of whom had yet to stop. Red Bull endured further pit problems with Tsunoda, with the squad's light system not working – meaning that the drivers were not seeing the green light to signal that they could go.

On Lap 15, race leader Piastri had better luck in the pits after making a smooth stop for the medium tyres, bringing him back out into third. This put the top 10 order as Leclerc, Hamilton, Piastri, Russell, Albon, Norris, Gasly, Alonso, Ocon and Verstappen, with Albon and Alonso not having stopped along with the Ferrari pair.

The Williams and Aston Martin both soon pitted for the hard and medium compound respectively – before Leclerc and Hamilton followed on Lap 18 to double stack for the mediums, despite Leclerc seemingly suggesting that he wanted to do a one-stop strategy. The Monegasque returned to the track in fourth, with Hamilton in 11th.

2025 Bahrain Grand Prix: Norris hit with penalty for being out of position on the grid

With everybody having made their stops, the order on Lap 20 had shaken out as Piastri, Russell, Norris, Leclerc, Gasly, Ocon – who benefitted from pitting early – Antonelli, Verstappen, Doohan and Hamilton.

There was quickly a change to this thanks to Antonelli, the young Italian sweeping ahead of Verstappen into Turn 4 to take seventh. “Everything is overheating,” an unhappy Verstappen reported, with the Red Bull soon being chased down by Doohan and Hamilton behind.

Hamilton – the fastest man on track with fresh rubber on the SF-25 – was in no mood to hang around, the Briton making an overtake down the inside of Doohan into Turn 1 on Lap 22. Next in his sights was Verstappen – and that move quickly came, dropping the Dutchman to ninth.

“I can't even brake anymore,” Verstappen told race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase. Another man to nearly lose a position was Norris, with Leclerc attempting to snatch P3 from the Briton before going wide into Turn 1 and allowing the McLaren back through.

But the Monegasque did not have to wait long to complete the move, having found a way past Norris into Turn 4. And in a double success for Ferrari, Hamilton surged ahead of Antonelli for seventh – before then taking sixth from Ocon, the Scuderia's cars seemingly flying as the race reached its halfway point.

The Ferraris looked to have good pace at the halfway point of the race

Another pit drama played out for Verstappen as the Dutchman made his second stop for medium tyres on Lap 27, with the front right proving stubborn to remove. This dropped the Red Bull down to the back of the order.

Others subsequently started to visit the pits for a second time, Antonelli seemingly going onto a three-stop strategy as the soft compound went on to his Mercedes. Gasly had also stopped for the hard tyres, while Verstappen had already moved up to P14 on his recovery drive.

By Lap 30, Piastri remained some six seconds clear of Russell up ahead, with Leclerc, Norris and Hamilton completing the top five. Behind them a feisty scrap was playing out between Sainz and Tsunoda for sixth, during which a slide from the Red Bull resulted in contact with the Williams, throwing up some pieces of debris along the way.

A Safety Car was then called – seemingly in perfect timing for Piastri and indeed the rest of the top five, who all dived into the pits before returning to the track in their same order. And while much of the field also pitted, Gasly, Ocon, Verstappen and Doohan all stayed out, putting them in sixth to ninth respectively.

Russell, unlike the rest of the top five, had bolted on the soft tyres, leading the Briton to suggest that running the compound until the end of the race was an “audacious” strategy. Piastri and Norris were using the medium, with Leclerc and Hamilton on the hard.

Russell had an eventful race in Bahrain

As the Safety Car peeled into the pits on Lap 35, Piastri – having lost the lead he had built up earlier on – was faced with the task of fending off his competitors. While the Australian and Russell behind him both got away cleanly, Norris tried to fight past Leclerc but ended up boxed in by the Ferraris, with Hamilton getting through in the process.

Norris then retook the position from Hamilton – but with the move having seemingly taken place off the track into Turn 4, the McLaren then allowed the Ferrari back through. Within another lap, though, Norris had again snatched fourth from Hamilton, this time sealing the move for good.

By Lap 40, Piastri led from Russell by 1.8s, with Leclerc in third followed by Norris, Hamilton, Gasly, Verstappen, Ocon, Doohan – searching for his first points of the season – and Tsunoda. Those last positions looked uncertain, though, with Tsunoda hot on the tail of Doohan in a fight for ninth.

Bearman and Antonelli, meanwhile, were also closing in on the battle in 11th and 12th, the rookies both looking to add to their points tallies. Another duel of note was taking place between Leclerc and Norris over P3, the McLaren running within a second of the Ferrari by Lap 44.

Elsewhere, Sainz had been handed a 10-second time penalty for forcing another driver off the track during an earlier fight with Antonelli at the Safety Car restart – adding to the Spaniard's woes as replays showed a hole in the sidepod of the Williams, seemingly the cause of the debris that had brought out that Safety Car.

Piastri managed to maintain his lead after the Safety Car period came to a close

While Sainz went on to retire the car to bring his difficult day to a close, Norris locked up as he continued to look for a way past Leclerc. Another close moment occurred as the Briton tried again on Lap 49, with the McLaren still unable to overtake his rival as he ran off track into Turn 1.

It was on Lap 52 that Norris finally snatched the position around the outside into Turn 4 – while Russell had been noted for a DRS infringement which would be investigated after the race, the Briton complaining about the gears on his W16.

While Norris was shown a black and white flag for track limits, the McLaren was rapidly closing in on Russell amid the Mercedes seemingly experiencing some issues. Another name in trouble was Lawson, the Racing Bulls driver having been handed a 10-second penalty for causing a collision with Hulkenberg.

As Piastri maintained an untroubled lead up front, Norris was all over the back of Russell as the race entered into is final laps, the papaya car looking for a way past into several corners. Could Norris make it a 1-2 result for McLaren?

Norris set about trying to catch Russell during the latter stages

It turned out to not be the case, as – while Piastri crossed the line to take victory with a whopping lead of 15 seconds – Norris had to settle for third behind Russell, the gap between those two ending up at just 0.774s.

Leclerc held onto fourth, with Hamilton following in fifth, while Verstappen pulled off a late overtake on Gasly to snatch sixth place after a challenging event for the World Champion. Seventh for Gasly still brought Alpine their much-needed debut points of the season, though, while his former team mate Ocon was a solid eighth for Haas.

Tsunoda scored his first points as a Red Bull driver in ninth, with Bearman taking the final point on offer in P10, marking a strong recovery after starting from the back of the grid. Fellow rookie Antonelli, however, missed out in 11th, while Albon's run of points finishes also came to an end in 12th.

Hulkenberg, Hadjar and Doohan followed from P13 to P15 respectively, with Alonso down in P16 ahead of Lawson in P17. Stroll and Bortoleto brought up the rear in 18th and 19th, while Sainz was the only driver not to make it to the finish.

Piastri and Norris secured a 1-3 result for McLaren in Bahrain

""Great to have this result out here,"" said Piastri. ""It's been an incredible weekend, starting off with Qualifying yesterday. To finish the job today in style was nice. I can't thank the team enough for the car they've given us – it's pretty handy out there.

""It's been a great weekend, and I'm very proud of what I've done this weekend as well. I'm very proud to do it here in Bahrain as well, it's obviously a very important race for us given our owners. It's never been a track that's been kind to us, so it's nice to finally have that first win for the team here.""

	Forget The White Lotus, it's now The White POTUS.


	Following the Mike White-created show‘s epic season three finale last Sunday, Saturday Night Live decided to spoof the hit HBO show, but with a President Donald Trump twist.




	The pre-taped sketch (below) begins with Chloe Fineman portraying Melania Trump, but with Victoria Ratliff's (Parker Posey's character on The White Lotus) iconic southern accent. “Hun? Donald, are you getting ready? Hello? Earth to Donald, it's your wife, Melania. Are you OK?” she asks her husband. However, James Austin Johnson's Trump, who is seemingly taking on the role of Jason Isaacs's Timothy Ratliff, clearly has his mind on something else.

	As for the rest of the memorable Ratliff — or should I say Trump — family, who are plagued by financial troubles throughout season three, Mikey Day portrays Donald Trump Jr. (Patrick Schwarzenegger's Saxon), former SNL castmember Alex Moffat makes a cameo as Eric Trump (Sam Nivola's Lochlan) and Scarlett Johansson makes a surprise appearance as Ivanka Trump (Sarah Catherine Hook's Piper).


	“We are so lucky that America will always be a rich and powerful nation. I mean, can you imagine how awful it would be if America lost all its money and no one in the world respected us anymore?” Fineman's Melania says at the dinner table, just as Austin's Trump gets a text with an article's headline that reads, “Trump Triggers Worldwide Recession.” 


	“You would never let our economy go to pieces. Right, hun?” Fineman's Melania adds.


Host Jon Hamm also portrays Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who took on the role of Rick (Walton Goggins), while Sarah Sherman plays Aimee Lou Wood's Chelsea and Lizzo plays Natasha Rothwell's Belinda. “These old white Trump dudes are trying to ruin my life,” the singer-rapper says. “Oh my gosh, there's $5 million in my bank account. It was $20 million last week.”


	Day's Don Jr. later ends up having a shocking sex scene similar to Saxon's in The White Lotus; however, instead of the season three incest storyline, he gets intimate with Kenan Thompson's Tiger Woods, who is currently dating Don Jr.'s real-life ex-wife.


SNL also couldn't forget several key figures in the current Trump administration. In the sketch, Heidi Gardner also plays Kristi Noem, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, while Ashley Padilla portrays U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Marcello Hernández plays U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Warner Bros.' 'A Minecraft Movie' has cleared the $550 million mark at the worldwide box office in less than two weeks.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	There's no slowing down A Minecraft Movie, which hurtled past the $550 million mark at the global box office on its way to likely becoming the first title of 2025 to join the $1 billion club.


	The Warner Bros. family event pic easily stayed No. 1 in its second weekend with a huge domestic haul of $80.6 million. It has now earned $281 million in North America and $296.6 million overseas for a worldwide total of $550.6 million. The foreign tally includes $20.5 million from China, one of the best showings in recent memory for a Hollywood title (Legendary East is handling the film there). However, Minecraft did tumble 68 percent in its second weekend after the Chinese government said it would further restrict film imports amid the ongoing tariff war with the Trump administration.

	Thanks in large measure to the astonishing performance of A Minecraft Movie, box office revenue in North America is once again on par with the same corridor in 2024 (not long ago, it was down 20 percent). Legendary, which has a 25 percent stake in the pic, produced the film for Warners alongside Vertigo.

	Playing in 4,289 theaters, Minecraft — which is making unintended headlines for rowdy behavior from audiences during certain scenes — lorded over a crowded pack of new films opening over the April 11-13 frame in advance of Easter, which falls on April 21 this year.


	Among the newbies, Angel Studios' animated faith-based pic The King of Kings fared the best after winning over Middle America — the top-grossing theater is in Spartanburg, South Carolina — and receiving a coveted A+ from ticket buyers. The movie, inspired by a Charles Dickens' tale of a boy and father who explore the life of Jesus, opened in second-place with a better-than-expected $19 million from 3,200 locations (in a successful marketing stunt, kids are being allowed in for free).


	That marks the best start for Angel Studios' behind its inaugural release and cultural sensation Sound of Freedom. Based in Utah, Angel says King of Kings boasts the biggest opening in history for a biblical animated feature.


	“This film is a testament to the power of storytelling that amplifies light and brings families together. Our Angel Guild and global community of supporters have once again shown that there's a massive audience eager for stories that inspire and uplift,” Angel global head of theatrical distribution and brand development Brandon Purdie said in a statement.

	











	Directed by Seong-Ho Jang, the film's all-star voice cast includes Kenneth Branagh, Uma Thurman, Pierce Brosnan, Mark Hamill, Roman Griffin Davis, Forest Whitaker, Ben Kingsley and Oscar Isaac, who plays Jesus.


	Coming in third was 20th Century and Disney's Rami Malek spy thriller The Amateur. The adult-skewing drama, earning a B+ CinemaScore and strong audience scores, opened to $15 million from 3,400 theaters. That's slightly ahead of expectations for the film, even if it has left some critics unimpressed. Rachel Brosnahan, Laurence Fishburne and Caitríona Balfe also star in James Hawes' adaptation of the Robert Littell novel about a man shattered by loss but galvanized by justice.


	A24's Warfare opened in fourth place with an estimated $8.3 million from 2,670 cinemas, including select Imax screens. The gritty Iraqi war drama has received notable media attention because of the unique perspective and experience of co-director Ray Mendoza, a former Navy SEAL. Sitting in the other director's seat is well-respected filmmaker Alex Garland (Civil War). The movie has drawn strong marks from reviewers and moviegoers alike, along with an A- CinemaScore (according to A24, this is the strongest reception of Garland's career, including a 94 percent critics score and 93 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes).


	The film's ensemble cast is led by Will Poulter, Cosmo Jarvis, Kit Connor, Michael Gandolfini, Charles Melton, D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai and Joseph Quinn. Warfare premiered at the American Legion Theater in L.A. and continued with a national tour focused on screenings for military families across the country. 

	











	Blumhouse and Universal's dating-gone-wrong horror pic Drop — starring White Lotus actress Meghann Fahy opposite Brandon Sklenar — came in fifth with $7.5 million. The pic has been relatively well-received by critics and audiences since making its debut at SXSW. Directed by Christopher Landon and playing in 3,085 theaters, the film follows a widowed mother who returns to the dating scene only to find herself caught in an awful game of cat and mouse.


	Some box office pundits note that some of the films opening this weekend should have been spaced out so as not to cannibalize each other (i.e., Amateur versus Warfare, or King of Kings versus Fathom's ongoing viewing of episodes from season five of The Chosen: The Last Supper).


	Distributed by Fathom, part three of The Chosen: The Last Supper generated $5.8 million in grosses from 2,296 cinemas to come in sixth for the weekend. Season five has earned a combined $34 million, making it the most successful theatrical outing for the popular ongoing series about the life of Jesus.


April 13, 7:45 a.m.: Updated with revised weekend numbers.

The actor returns to host the NBC sketch comedy show for the fourth time, with musical guest Lizzo.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Jon Hamm got a helping hand from none other than Kieran Culkin during his opening monologue on Saturday Night Live.


	He begins the monologue by commemorating his fourth time hosting the show, noting that he's made 14 cameos on the show aside from his hosting gigs. After a brief montage of his past appearances were shown, Hamm raves about how “important” a cameo can be to a show, “like when a sketch needs that little something extra to take it from a medium sketch to a marginally better than a medium sketch, or when a monologue is feeling aimless and like then it needs a jolt of energy,” to which Culkin enters the stage.

	“Hey, Jon,” Culkin says as the crowd erupts in applause. “I'm just making a cameo.” Hamm jokes about “doing really well all by myself” amid the monologue, to which Culkin replies, “I'm sorry, man, hey, I'll make it up to you.”


	“Okay, cool,” Hamm starts, “Just give me your Oscar!” Culkin is notably unwilling, to which he adds, “Well, don't you have enough, man? I've seen those photos of you in your gray sweatpants.”


	At the end of Culkin's brief cameo, Hamm threw a jab towards his way, saying, “Alright, whatever dude, you know, that Mad Men was better than Succession.” Culkin then parted ways before refuting Hamm's comments, saying, “I love you, bye.” 


	After the recent Oscar winner left the stage, Hamm showed his love for SNL: “Well, I guess what I'm trying to say is whether I'm hosting or just popping by, it's great to be on this show in any capacity. I mean, it's an American institution and there's literally nowhere I'd rather be than right here live on this stage saying, ‘We've got a great show for you tonight!'”


	Hamm, the star of Your Friends & Neighbors, returned to SNL to host for the fourth time alongside Lizzo as the night's musical guest. Saturday night marked Hamm's long-awaited return to the NBC sketch comedy series after his last hosting gig in 2010.


	At the start of the show, SNL once again riffed on President Donald Trump's new tariff plan that sent the country into a trade war — with a religious twist.


	The NBC sketch comedy show's cold open began with a voice narrating, “Easter, the celebration of the risen Christ. The Bible tells us that Jesus and his disciples traveled to the city of Jerusalem. While there, Jesus visited the temple and enraged upon seeing money changers transacting business within its sacred walls, expelled them all. In mere days, Jesus would be arrested and crucified, only to rise again on the 3rd day, but it began with the cleansing of the temple.”

	











	The camera then cuts to a parody of the cleansing of the temple, with Mikey Day playing Jesus. “This should be a house of prayer. These merchants and money changers have turned it into a den of thieves,” Day's Jesus says. “I will rid this place of all its money,” he says before James Austin Johnson's Trump enters the shot, saying, “Remind you of anyone?”


	“I also got rid of money last week, but instead of one temple, I did the whole country, maybe even the globe. The money's gone high,” Johnson's Trump says. “It's me, your favorite President Donald ‘Jesus' Trump, comparing myself to the Son of God once again, you know, many people are even calling me the Messiah for the mess I made out of the economy.”


	He continues, “All because of my beautiful tariffs. They're so beautiful, they were working so well that I had to stop them. The Prime Minister of Canada, big guy, tears in his eyes, he called me and he said, ‘Sir, if you do this, you will upend the global economy, take the stocks and bond markets and unite your allies against you.' And I said, ‘Let me cook!'”


	“So we had to stop, but now everything is back exactly how it was, minus a few trillion dollars. Oh well,” he continues, “It's true, the stock market did a Jesus — it died, then on the third day, it was risen. And then on the fourth day, it died again, possibly never to return, just like Jesus.”


	Later in the episode, Johnson's Trump returns for a sketch inspired by The White Lotus. Seemingly based on season three's finale, the cast resumes roles of the infamous Ratliff family who are plagued by financial troubles. Johnson's Trump was a clear parody of Jason Isaacs's Timothy Ratliff, while Chloe Fineman portrays Melanie Trump (Parker Posey's Victoria Ratliff), Mikey Day joins as Donald Trump Jr. (Patrick Schwarzenegger's Saxon), Alex Moffat joins as Eric Trump (Sam Nivola's Lochan) and a surprise appearance from Scarlett Johansson as Ivanka Trump (Sarah Catherine Hook's Piper).

	











	“We are so lucky that America will always be a rich and powerful nation. I mean, can you imagine how awful it would be if America lost all its money and no one in the world respected us anymore?” Fineman's Melania says to the Trump-Ratliff family as Austin's Trump gets a message with an article headline that says, “Trump Triggers Worldwide Recession.”


	“You would never let our economy go to pieces. Right, hun?” Fineman's Melania says.

Plus, highlights from Enhypen, Gustavo Dudamel with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, The Original Misfits and more.


	Coachella's second day, Saturday, April 12, was backloaded with one must-see set after another, with T-Pain's hits-filled performance leading into stellar sunset sets from both Charli xcx as well as Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic (featuring a handful of special guests).


	And even though day two was a bit overcast, allowing for a break from the intense heat of day one, Charli's set more than made up for the temperature drop; While her show was its own creation, existing separately from her joint Sweat tour with Troye Sivan, sweat is what many did. ‘Bratchella' turned up the heat as Charli writhed and strutted onstage, all the while welcoming a revolving door of guests including Sivan for “Talk Talk,” Lorde for “Girl, So Confusing” (during which Charli declared “Lorde Summer 2025”) and Billie Eilish for “Guess.”


	Enhypen and Green Day then ushered in the evening, and though the latter was billed as Saturday's headlining act, the rockers were followed by The Original Misfits and a near-midnight set from Travis Scott. (The rapper wrote on X on Friday, April 11: “YES IM HEADLINING COACHELLA ON SATURDAY. THEY THINK THEY GON PUT THE RAGE ON LATE F–K THAAT ALL THE FANS YOU KNOW WHATS UP LET EM KNOW WHILE U OUT THERE.”)


	Saturday also featured a heavy rotation of dance acts, including Darkside, horsegiirL, Barry Can't Swim and Above & Beyond all in succession of one another.


	Read below for all the highlights from Saturday, with Friday's recap also available and another daily roundup of highlights coming Sunday.


	“It took me 20 years to get to this stage,” T-Pain reflected to the sea of fans from Coachella's main stage. A sign of his longevity and hitmaking ability, the Florida native delivered one of the weekend's most fun sets, which kept the audience guessing at every turn. 


	Whether it was his dancing, cover of Journey's “Don't Stop Believing” or blending Travis Scott's “FE!N” with his “Kiss Kiss” anthem, there was something for everyone to enjoy during his happy hour set. With hits like “Buy U a Drank” to “I'm N Luv” or his memorable assists on Lil Wayne's “Got Money” and Ye's “Good Life,” T-Pain's set proved he is never going out of style. — MICHAEL SAPANORA


	The Vampires have landed in the desert. Enhyped made history with their Coachella debut as the faster K-pop act to go from its first release to a Coachella festival stage. Draped in denim fits, the boy band ran through hits like “Walk the Line,” “Paranormal,” “XO,” “No Doubt” and “Sweet Venom” while keeping the crowd engaged at every turn. The act's set brought fans on a journey as the stage set evolved from a burning city to the serenity of the clouds. The boys have come a long way from I-Land. — M.S


	A years-in-the-making booking brought famed conductor Gustavo Dudamel and the sprawling 75-ish person orchestra (the “travel sized” version of the Los Angeles Philharmonic) to the Outdoor Stage for golden hour. The question ahead of time was if the group would find any connective tissue with the rest of the lineup or feel more like an anomaly, and the answer was ultimately both, in the best way. The show began with Wagner's “Ride of the Valkyries,” and from there on more or less traded off between such classical bangers and more modern material co-performed with a host of guests. Laufey appeared to perform “From The Start” and her newest song “Silver Lining,” with the Phil then doing Vivaldi's “Spring 1” before Maren Morris and a gospel choir performed “My Church.” Subsequent guests included Becky G, Ca7riel and Paco Amoroso, (the latter two artists also from Dudamel's own native country of Venezuela), Zedd, the electronic producer who himself is classically trained and co-performed his 2012 smash “Clarity” and LL Cool J, who performed a medley of hits including “Mama Said Knock You Out,” “I Need Love” and “Murdergram.” All of it was sandwiched betwixt selections from John Williams, Beethoven and Bach, creating what was arguably the most weekend's most historically rich throwback set. — K.B.


	The long tail of Brat is visible to the naked eye at Coachella 2025, where this weekend a not insignificant portion of the crowd was dressed in the kind of asymmetrical ruffled skirts, wraparound sunglasses and black knee high boots that Charli XCX has popularized during her culture-shaking marathon run around the album, which came out two months after last year's Coachella. Given that we've all been living through the many seasons of Brat ever since, it felt fitting that Charli kept her Saturday night performance almost entirely album-centric, using the slot on the Coachella main stage — where she last appeared in 2023 — to spotlight the LP's music, collaborators, aesthetic and attitude. The show's special guests only helped Charli deliver another peak moment for the project. — K.B.


	After hosting a “Fighting Oligarchy” rally in Los Angeles — alongside Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Neil Young, Maggie Rogers and Joan Baez — Sanders' day didn't end there. The senator managed to get himself out to the desert in record time to bring his message to a new audience: Coachella. Sanders appeared not only to introduce Clairo, but to applaud her for her own efforts in making this world a better one. “I'm here because Clairo has used her prominence to fight for women's rights, to try to end the terrible, brutal war in Gaza, where thousands of women and children are being killed,” said Sanders. “So I want to thank Clairo, not only for being in a great band, but for the great work she is doing.” — LYNDSEY HAVENS


	“Coachella 2025, are you ready?!” asked Billie Joe Armstrong while ferociously playing the riff to “American Idiot,” which opened the band's headlining set. And the thing was, in the year 2025, the crowd had never been more ready for this moment. Because at a time like this, an act like Green Day is exactly what so many need. (Including Flava Flav and Cara Delevingne, who took selfies and danced together during the show.) Throughout its high-energy, hits-filled set, Green Day gave the crowd permission to be angry about the current state of affairs. In “American Idiot” the band continued its tradition of changing a particular lyric, choosing Coachella to declare: “I'm not part of the MAGA agenda” (the original line is: “I'm not a part of the redneck agenda). And later, toward the end of the nearly two-hour-long set, the band made another lyrical swap; on “Jesus of Suburbia,” Armstrong sang, “Runnin' away from pain, like the kids from Palestine (the original line is: “Runnin' away from pain when you've been victimized”). Otherwise, Armstrong didn't say much outside of the music – though he did repeat, “Coachella!” upwards of 20 times. And that's what Green Day's set was really all about – the fact that a punk-rock band formed in the late ‘80s was headlining Coachella nearly 40 years later with a catalog that felt just as, if not more relevant than ever before is an incredible feat. At one point, a small blimp reading “bad news” floated across the crowd – and while that may feel true of the world, tonight Green Day made sure to deliver something great. — L.H.


	The 2024 Brat ascendency didn't just ultimately result in Charli xcx's Saturday night slot on the mainstage, but her associates from the album getting choice Coachella billing in the wake of their own Brat-adjacent come-up. After A.G. Cook's Friday night set in the Gobi, fellow album producer The Dare played an 11 p.m. show in the Mojave. But while Cook overtly wove in the material from Brat along with his own productions, The Dare channeled the album more in attitude, bringing its same spirit of blasé cool to a performance that included music from across his 2024 album What's Wrong With New York, with the performance also serving as a reminder that indie sleaze (or indie sleaze 2.0, in this case) is often just better and more visceral in the live format. — K.B.


	Punk rock is foundational to the Coachella story, as the event's producer Goldenvoice was originally a punk promoter in L.A. and Orange County. And so it felt right not only that The Misfits got the extremely rare gift of getting its famous font on the festival lineup, but also a choice slot of a closing set on the Outdoor Stage. Dressed in spiked jackets and, in the case of guitarist Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein, white face paint, the band played classics including 1981's “Vampira,” 1979's “Where Eagles Dare” and 1986's “Hollywood Babylon.” The crowd included older fans, young kids watching from their parents shoulders, a frenetic mosh pit and Green Day's Tré Cool, fresh off headlining the main stage. — K.B.


	Travis Scott has always wanted to headline Coachella — he even rapped about the decorated festival on ASTROWORLD's “SKELETONS.” Scott earned his chance on Saturday as La Flame continued to push the envelope with his innovative world building in a performance that's simply unmatched in hip-hop at the moment. For his first surprise, Scott enlisted Florida A&M University and Jackson State's marching bands to bring a cinematic texture to songs songs old and new. Fireworks — musically and literally — were aplenty with Scott hopping from the main stage to his raised circular structure in the middle of the general admission raging crowd. After traveling the globe behind UTOPIA for a majority of 2023 and 2024, Scott launched a new musical era while previewing a pair of songs that are tentatively titled “She Goin Dumb” and “On Jacques.” It's unclear if they'll eventually land on his next solo effort or the JACKBOYS 2 label compilation. The Houston rager always brings some sort of theatrical element to his shows testing the limits of what's physically possible and tonight was no different with dancers floating through the sky during “Stargazing” or Scott rappelling down the stage stanchion while performing “Skyfall.” Being a branch on the Kanye West artistic family tree, having a model strut down the catwalk as the muse for “90210”  felt like something out of Ye's “Runaway” playbook. Scott threw a new coat of paint on classic bangers like “SICKO MODE” and multiple renditions of “FE!N” along with his “TELEKINESIS” closer thanks to the marching band's brass instrumentation mixing with his AutoTune-laced vocals. An altered version of the “Modern Jam” and Drake's “NOKIA” mash-up that went viral on X was even incorporated into the set.  While Scott has called arenas home for the majority of his past two U.S. treks, La Flame's creativity thrives when the stakes are highest and venues are biggest. — M.S.

Nathan is credited with getting acts like Barenaked Ladies and 3 Doors Down signed.


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



	Marc Nathan, the promotion and A&R executive who in his 55-year career helped Barenaked Ladies, 3 Doors Down and more get record deals, has died. He was 70.


	He passed away earlier this week at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, a representative says. A statement said Nathan had “been ill for some time and he finally succumbed to a variety of afflictions.”


	Nathan got his foot in the door in the music industry at just 15 years old, when the then-Queens, New York, kid wrote a letter to Todd Rundgren and received a reply from Ampex Records' Paul Fishkin, in regards to a track listing anomaly he found on Rundgren's Runt album. 

	











	“He just so happened to open a stack of Todd's fan mail that day. If he hadn't opened that stack of mail that day, you know … My life would have been altered forever,” Nathan said in an interview in 2019.


	Nathan soon landed his first industry job in radio promotion at Ampex, which led to him building a career with roles in promotion at labels including Bearsville, Casablanca, Playboy, Sire and Atlantic.


	“I lost my best friend of 55 years,” Fishkin noted following his death. “Marc Nathan walked like he talked as well as anyone I've ever known. His irascible, acquired taste persona was what I enjoyed the most, even though maddening at times. We had much in common chiding and deriding phonies and pretentious fools in sports, politics, but most importantly, the music business. We occasionally enjoyed busting each other as well. We delighted in having our own sometimes hilarious shorthand putting us on the floor at times with uncontrollable laughter. He was a great record man, and a baseball and hockey chronicler supreme, among his many talents and passions. And yes, I have stories! But most important was his loyalty and support for all the right people and issues. And he never let me down in all those 55 years.”


	Over the years — with stints in New York, Los Angeles and, most recently, Nashville — Nathan also worked in A&R, having a hand in Universal's acquisition of Cash Money Records, and in talent development for Universal, Capitol, Atlantic/ATCO and imprints. 


	Among the artists he got signed were the bands 3 Doors Down (at Universal) and Barenaked Ladies (at Sire). He later established a label, Flagship Records, to release solo work from Barenaked Ladies co-founder Steven Page.

	











	“Marc was a record person of the highest order,” Page wrote following his death. “He was absolutely and passionately obsessed with music and amassed an encyclopedic memory for songs, charts and artists. He played a huge role in my career and in my life — a role that arced across our entire shared timeline. Marc was a guy who loved big, emotional music and also too-smart-for-its-own-good pop and had a huge soft spot for silly novelty songs too. We kind of fit the bill perfectly for him and he got us. Marc took our demo tape to Seymour Stein at Sire records, and, thankfully, Seymour got it. While everyone else was calling us a throwaway, Seymour looked at Marc and said, ‘They're a Simon and Garfunkel for the ‘90s.' Marc was always especially proud of his involvement, and I'm eternally grateful to him for it.”


	Page added, “He was among the first and most persistent of my friends to lend me support, advice and solidarity. He could be a nudge, but that's only because he had a huge heart and he really, really cared. There were many, many people in his life that he would counsel and coach and cajole and mentor through their darkest hours — he'd been there and back several times himself — and I'm proud and grateful to be one of those friends. I'm lucky to have known him.”

					By Natalie Oganesyan 

Weekend Editor


Weekend Update was full of zingers about President Donald Trump‘s rapid about-face in the wake of the stock market crash his global tariffs spurred.


	Co-anchor Colin Jost kicked off the Saturday Night Live segment by quipping that POTUS “tried to rescue the economy from the disastrous policies of whoever was president last week.” 


	Addressing corporate CEOs' shock at the aggressive tariffs, the late-night show played a supercut of Trump's affinity for tariffs, something voiced often during his presidential campaign. “It's like listening to Bubba Gump talk about shrimp,” Jost remarked.

	











	Meanwhile, co-host Michael Che chimed in, calling into question Trump's claim that the economic downturn was like treating an ailment: “Yeah, but this feels like we took a whole bottle of medicine with a glass of vodka and laid in a warm bath.”

	Che also got the biggest reaction of the night, with his one-liner: “It was reported that Elon Musk personally appealed to President Trump to stop his tariff plan, and it worked! The stock market went up like this,” he said, enthusiastically, as a picture of Musk's Nazi-like salute flashed on screen, eliciting exclamations from the audience.


	Later on, Weekend Update featured a trio of guest appearances from Bowen Yang who resurrected his recurring Chinese trade minister Chen Biao, Emil Wakim and his notes on American patriotism and Sarah Sherman as Jost's fictitious accountant Dawn Altman.


	Some one-liner highlights from each:


	“So the next time you buy a pair of Tom's, they'll donate another pair to you, because you're the one in need, you poor bitch!” Yang exclaimed in reference to the dire state of the American economy.


	Wakim, who entered the Weekend Update desk with mini American flags in tow, began, “This was just to buy me some good will before the stuff I'm about to say, but it's a tough time to criticize America publicly, especially with eyebrows like this.” True to his stand-up roots, the SNL rookie's three-minute set launched into cracks about the “cruelty” of everyday interactions with Uber Eats drivers that borderline on “racist” after consumers order a “$40 burrito” as a treat following a “hard day sending emails for Hitler or whatever anyone's job is.”

	











	Sherman, in pitch perfect distress as Dawn Altman, ended her time on Weekend Update by putting her head through the back wall of the set, exclaiming that there were “so many” women tied up inside the wall, which prompted a set of bound hands to come out of the torn wallpaper.

	Although he admits to enjoying a “little bit of mischief,” Jason Isaacs is declaring he's no gossip.


	Following the White Lotus star's comments about the behind-the-scenes “drama” on Season 3, he recently 


	“Like anywhere you go for the summer, there's friendships, there's romances, there's arguments, there's cliques that form and break and reform and stuff like that. I'm careful,” said Isaacs on SiriusXM's The Happy Hour, adding: “I'm not stupid. I look at the Internet. I only read every single word written about The White Lotus and about everybody in it.”


	He called out the online hordes of “amateur Sherlock Holmes” who speculate about cast drama based on the actors' social media activity, noting that his previous comments were about crew members that the audience has “never met before.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“Nobody has the slightest clue what they're talking about,” he continued. “People who think they're onto something, and it then it gets magnified because of a thousand other people. Nobody has any clue.”


	Isaacs said, “First of all, it's none of your business. I'm just saying it wasn't a holiday, and partly I started saying that because people think we were on a seven-month holiday, and believe me, it felt like work a lot of the time. It was insanely hot and there's all the normal social tensions you get anywhere. But for all of you [that] think you've cracked it by something you think someone has posted or is in a photo or not, you're just so far from the truth, believe me.”


	The Golden Globe nominee's latest comments come after he told Vulture the set was like “a cross between summer camp and Lord of the Flies but in a gilded cage,” adding: “It wasn't a holiday.”


	“Some people got very close, there were friendships that were made and friendships that were lost,” said Isaacs. “All the things you would imagine with a group of people unanchored from their home lives on the other side of the world, in the intense pressure cooker of the working environment with eye-melting heat and insects and late nights. They say in the show, ‘What happens in Thailand stays in Thailand,' but there's an off-screen White Lotus as well, with fewer deaths but just as much drama. … I became very close to some people and less close to others, but we still all had that experience together and there's a certain level of discretion required.”

					By Armando Tinoco 

Staff Writer


Mickey Rourke was removed from the Celebrity Big Brother UK house after further usage of inappropriate language.


	The incident happened over the weekend, and the moment will air on Sunday's episode of the reality TV competition.


	During a pirate-themed task where the housemates had to work together, things got out of hand between Mickey and fellow housemate Chris Hughes.


	Mickey says to Chris, “You looking at me?” and then adds, “Don't eyeball me.”


	Chris responds, “Mickey it was a joke, f***ing…”


	Mickey says, “Don't f***ing eyeball me. You c***.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Although the housemates tried to diffuse the situation, things were already too heated. Big Brother chimed in and asked Mickey to go to the Diary Room.

	Following a conversation with Big Brother in the Diary Room about his behaviour, Mickey returns to the garden and apologises to Chris. Mickey then heads inside.


	Later on, Mickey went back to the Diary Room where Big Brother said, “Earlier today in a disagreement with Chris, your language and behaviour was threatening and aggressive. Big Brother does not tolerate threatening language or behaviour. In addition, you have used inappropriate sexual language to Ella.”


	“Oh, I'm not aware of that but okay,” Mickey responds.


	Big Brother continued, “This language has caused offence to your fellow housemates and could cause offence to the viewing public. This is not the first time Big Brother has had to speak to you about your offensive and inappropriate language.”

	Mickey admits to doing wrong and apologizes, saying, “I'm sorry. I can't take it back, you know, I stepped over the line. And I take responsibility for doing the wrong thing. ‘Cause I lost my temper, and I've been trying to work on it my whole life and I wish I would have had better self-control and I'm very sorry. I'm ashamed of myself for losing it for a few seconds there. Nobody got touched or hurt. Maybe some feelings got hurt or maybe others have feelings about others getting upset but, you know, I'm sorry about that.”

	











	However, because Mickey had repeatedly breached the Celebrity Big Brother rules, Big Brother removed him from the house.


	“Big Brother considers your language and behaviour today to be seriously unacceptable and as a result Big Brother has no option but to ask you to leave the Big Brother house,” Big Brother said.


	In his departing words from the house, Mickey said, “I blame myself, I know it was my bad. You know, I've got a short fuse and I know I upset a lot of people out there, you know. And I'm sorry for that. I'm actually ashamed of myself for getting that hot. I went over the line, you know, I did wrong. I guess, like they say, I'm a work in progress. I just wanna pack my bags and leave, you know. I wanted to leave yesterday actually but I wasn't chosen.”


	Rourke had been warned earlier this week about using inappropriate language after he used a homophobic slur toward fellow housemate JoJo Siwa.


	“I apologize. I don't have dishonorable intentions – I'm just talking smack you know. I wasn't taking it all so serious. I didn't mean it in any bad intentions and if I did, sorry,” Rourke told Big Brother in the Diary Room.


	After exiting the Diary Room, Rourke had a moment with Siwa, telling her, “I want to apologize. I've got a habit of having a short fuse. And I don't mean nothing by it. I do mean it [sorry]. If I didn't, I wouldn't say it to you.”

	Siwa nominated Rourke with a killer nomination, putting him on the block and at risk of leaving the house. The actor escaped eviction following the public vote, which opted to evict the controversial conservative politician Michael Fabricant instead.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM WRITETHRU: Refresh for updates… It's the 15th weekend of the box office year, and only the fourth to exceed $100M+ for all titles. The industry needs to cherish this.


	True, Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie is delivering 52% of the $153M frame, still an $80.6M second weekend, but we can't imagine that any exhibitor is complaining about the diversity or the amount of product in the marketplace. With an $80M second weekend, that's the 16th best second weekend ever for a movie, and the second best second weekend for a videogame movie after Super Mario Bros' ($92.3M). Some rivals believe the domestic endgame for Minecraft Movie is close to a half billion; Super Mario Bros got to $574.9M. Global running cume is $550.6M. 












	A funny note about cinemas getting trashed: None of the three top circuits would issue statements that such chaos was going on. At the same time I hear that social media is just amplifying the trend more than it is. In short, it's not like every other showtime at the Century City AMC is getting flooded in popcorn. Nonetheless, Regal is encouraging melee on Easter Sunday. 




			Watch on Deadline		






A post shared by Regal Cinemas (@regalmovies)


	Without A Minecraft Movie, we'd have Angel Studios' animated Charles Dickens-Jesus movie The King of Kings leading with $19.05M; which technically as the faith-based distributed predicted, is the best opening for an animated Biblical movie, overpowering the opening of DreamWorks Animation's Prince of Egypt ($14.5M) 27 years ago. King of Kings gets an A+ CinemaScore, 94% Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak positive and 83% definite recommend among regular audiences. 59% female leaning due to moms. Middle of the country success with the Regal Pinnacle in Knoxville now the movie's top grossing location with $28K-plus.   


	“The Angel Guild picks winners. Angel's model is simple – listen to what our Angel Guild wants,” said Brandon Purdie, Global Head of Theatrical Distribution & Brand Development at Angel in a statement. “The CinemaScore for The King of Kings says it all. The film is  one of only 128 films to achieve an A+ CinemaScore, and only the 5th animated film to hold that title that isn't a Pixar/Disney production. Families want quality films to see together in theaters. This weekend simply reflects what audiences are craving.”

	











	All of this bodes well for the domestic box office heading into Easter weekend (with 72% K-12 schools off, 28% colleges on break on Good Friday) where Warner Bros will rule with a one-two punch of A Minecraft Movie and Ryan Coogler's Sinners (even if it falls short of No. 1 — we'll assess that if needed). Point is, we're finally getting some momentum at the B.O. as we head into summer. Even if Disney/Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* comes in at $70M (some distribution sources believe it's bad luck for summer if it doesn't kick off with a $100M+ opening); Memorial Day weekend is the surefire backup plan for the industry with Disney's Lilo & Stitch and Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning looking to at least deliver a combined $160M+ over 3 days.


	With five wide releases this weekend, others think there's too much product, particularly movies which are going after the same demo, i.e. 20th Century Studios' The Amateur (pulling in 57% guys, 47% men over 25) and A24's Warfare (72% men, 53% over 25). I get that argument, however, let's face it — given both movies' respective openings of $15M and $8.3M, even in a less competitive marketplace, their openings would be about the same given the P&A spend that both distributors are laying out.


	Given all the pom poms for Warfare as Alex Garland's best reviewed movie, 90% positive PostTrak and 67% definite recommend, A- CinemaScore (which is higher than his Civil War at B-), if this military red state grab was ever going to be American Sniper and touch an electric rod, then it would. Given Warfare‘s $20M production cost (vs. Civil War‘s $50M), the movie was never expected to perform like the latter (which wound up as A24's biggest opening ever at $25.5M) given its P&A to production cost spend. Similar to how we've dinged Warners for underspending on the P&A for the audience pleaser Companion ($9.3M), A24 may have left potential box office on the table with Warfare. In the same breath, for the indie distributor, Warfare is their 6th highest opening at the box office just after Robert Egger's The Witch ($8.8M). Warfare‘s amount of cash is bigger than any wide break by Everything Everywhere All at Once ($6.1M in weekend 4), but this is a red state play for the hipster studio; the former Oscar winner had a big boost from its partnership with Gold House screenings. In regard to Warfare‘s social media reach across TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, X, and Facebook, RelishMix counts 81.7M followers, which is 22% below genre war norms and trailing Civil War‘s 101M followers, and Warner Bros' Chris Hemsworth-Michael Shannon post-9/11 Afghanistan movie 12 Strong, which had 105.4M followers before opening in 2018 for an opening of $15.8M.


The Amateur is playing as expected on the coasts while Warfare has invaded South Central and West. Social media reach across TikTok, X, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube stood at 98M before opening for Amateur, which is ahead of The Beekeeper (63.8M), which the movie's opening isn't far from at $16.5M. Perhaps Rami Malek has a new career in meat and potato action movies ala Jason Statham and Liam Neeson. Upside for playability and exhibition: Amateur is a professional at the box office with at least a 60-day window to PVOD, Disney being the guardian of such length. Worldwide debut for the $60M net production of Amateur is $32.2M. 


Amateur‘s diversity demos are 49% Caucasian, 21% Latino and Hispanic, 16% Black, 8% Asian & 7% NatAm/Other with the AMC Lincoln Square in NYC the pic's top grossing theater through Saturday at $37,4K. The James Hawes-directed movie received a B+ CinemaScore with PostTrak audiences giving it a 77% positive and 57% definite recommend.

	











	AMC Lincoln Square is also the top venue for Warfare with a running total of $46,5K. Diversity make-up was 47% Caucasian, 29% Latino and Hispanic, 10% Black, 9% Asian & 5% NatAm/Other. 


	Blumhouse/Universal's Drop which pulled in (to use that word lightly) 53% female, is looking at a $7.5M opening in another lackluster opening for the horror label after Wolf Man‘s $10.8M and Woman in the Yard‘s $9.3M. CinemaScore is a B, which is high praise for a genre suspense film. Rotten Tomatoes audience score is 80%. RelishMix says that the social media universe for the Christopher Landon directed movie at 191M was ahead of The Monkey (148.5M) and Longlegs (130.5M). Audience exits are better than Woman in the Yard‘s C- and RT audience rating of 46%, as well as Wolf Man‘s C- and RT audience 56%. Why isn't this doing a little more? For one, it's more My Dinner With Freaky Andre in a high-end Chicago restaurant than slasher. Biggest demo was 25-34 year olds at 35% with a diversity make-up of 52% White, 21% Latino, 12% Black, 8% Asian & 6% NatAm/Other. Drop is playing in the East, South Central and West with AMC's The Grove now the movie's best grossing multiplex with $23K-plus so far. The final magic domestic number for Blumhouse's thrifty fare this year seems to be $20M+. M3GAN 2.0 can't arrive soon enough (she gets here on June 27).


	Fathom's The Chosen: The Last Supper – Part 3 is seeing a $5.8M opening after $2.5M Friday at 2,296 locations. So far, not counting Sunday, The Chosen: The Last Supper in its trinity of parts currently counts $34M at the domestic box office. Last Supper Part 3 is playing in the middle of the country with Cinemark 12 American Fork UT the top grossing location with just under $7k as of Friday.


	The Ajith Kumar-Trisha Krishnan mob movie Good Bad Ugly posted an estimated $812K 3-day at 599 theaters. Ok tickets sales we understand from Toronto, Dallas, Austin, San Francisco, Atlanta and Seattle. Blurb: A fearless don tries to change his ruthless ways and violent past to live peacefully with his family. However, his dark past continues to haunt him. He faces it head-on and overcomes it. RT Audiences give it a 74%. Here's the trailer below:


	Indie shoutout: Michael Angarano has made a sweet, '70s comedy throwback in the bromance movie Sacramento in which he stars alongside Michael Cera, Kristen Stewart and wife Maya Erskine. It made $314K at 241 sites this past weekend from Vertical. LA, NYC and of course Sacramento ticket sales were great led by the Tower Theatre and also the Cinemark Century Arden. Angarano's character convinces his button-down long-time friend who has a baby on the way (Cera) to go on an impromptu road trip from Los Angeles to Sacramento. It's the type of movie they don't make anymore, and that's what is great about it. RT critic score is 89% certified fresh. There were also sellouts in the Nitehawk Prospect Park in Brooklyn, AMC Lincoln Square in Manhattan and the TIFF Lightbox in Toronto.

	As we told you last night, Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie crossed $200M after a $7.1M Thursday. It took Minecraft one week to hit that mark versus Illumination/Nintendo/Universal's The Super Mario Bros Movie, which did that figure in five days in 2023 — again because it was a Wednesday release leading into Easter weekend. The anticipation is that Minecraft eases by 60% this weekend to about $65M and another No. 1 showing.


	Angel Studios is calling $2M for its animated biblical movie The King of Kings. That's pure preview money from showtimes starting at 11 a.m. Thursday. There's some high excitement that the movie could have the edge over 20th Century Studios' $60M Rami Malek PG-13 spy movie The Amateur, after $14.6M in presales. We'll see soon if all that cash is for this weekend.

The Amateur did $2M in previews, but that includes early screenings as well as 2 p.m. showtimes yesterday. That's in the range of the previews for Amazon MGM Studios/Miramax's The Beekeeper ($2.4M previews with early screenings, $16.6M 3-day last year) and 20th's own The Creator ($1.6M previews and early screenings, $14M opening in 2023). The pic is launching today in 3,400 theaters, including 400 Imax auditoriums, 300 Premium Large Format screens and 100 D-Box/Motion screens. The 3-day is expected to be north of $12M.

	Universal/Blumhouse's date thriller Drop, starring Meghann Fahy and Brandon Sklenar, posted $730K in previews from 2,600 theaters that began screenings at 1:50 p.m. When you include Monday and Wednesday previews, that rises to $1.4M. Its 3-day is around $6M-$7M. The PG-13 feature is after women 17-34. Drop was made for $11M net before P&A after a robust tax credit from Ireland.


	A24's play for the middle of the country, Warfare, counts $1.16M previews from both early-access and Thursday showtimes that began at 4 p.m. at 2,670 sites. From directors Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza, the R-rated Navy SEAL POV movie is expected to come in between $7M-$9M. Warfare cost $20M before P&A.

Jessica Simpson is serving up sunshine and smiles with her latest Walmart collection—and she brought her mini-me, Birdie Mae, along for the ride. In a heartwarming Instagram post, the mother-daughter duo twinned in cheerful yellow swimsuits, radiating confidence and charm. ​

Jessica, 44, and her 6-year-old daughter Birdie showcased their close bond and impeccable style in matching swimwear from the new Jessica Simpson Collection at Walmart. Jessica's suit featured a plunging neckline paired with red cowboy boots and layered necklaces, while Birdie sported a kid-friendly cutout one-piece complemented by pink rain boots. The duo's coordinated look was both playful and stylish, embodying the collection's boho-chic aesthetic. ​

In the caption of her Instagram post, Jessica described the experience saying, “There's just something magical about seeing my kids in front of the camera.  It's beautiful to witness the confidence and playfulness my kids give in the moment. We had so much fun together.” 

“My kiddos make everything so real and authentic, which is exactly how I want my brand to be, so having them as part of it feels natural to me,” she also noted. “As for matching—it happens pretty often by accident, honestly. We seem to coordinate without even trying!  I also love a good mommy-and-me look, and it's so cute when we can make it happen.” It seems as though Jessica really cherishes the opportunity to share these special experiences with her daughter. ​

According to Fashion United, the new Walmart-exclusive Jessica Simpson Collection offers over 100 pieces, including apparel, swimwear, and jewelry, all designed to celebrate women of all body types. With sizes ranging from XS to 4X and prices mostly under $30, the collection combines California-inspired boho styles with Jessica's Texas roots. From floral patterns and crochet details to denim staples and vibrant swimwear, the line aims to make every woman feel confident and stylish. ​

“Walmart is an incredible one-stop shop and allows us to further expand our mission to help every woman feel her absolute best and most confident in fashion and accessories that are on-trend, while still being classic and affordable,” Jessica expressing her excitement about the collaboration (per Good Morning America).

If you needed a sign to refresh your summer wardrobe or just wanted something that makes you smile: Jessica and Birdie just delivered. The collection is incredibly cute, the prices don't hurt the wallet, and the energy? Straight-up sunshine.

HGTV star Tarek El Moussa is sharing how is dynamic with his ex-wife Christina Haack has improved. 

While speaking to Us Weekly in April 2025, Tarek El Moussa, who shares his older children Brayden, 9,  and Taylor, 14, with Haack, said filming the series, “The Flip Off,” alongside his ex-wife bettered their relationship. The HGTV series, which premiered in January 2025, featured Tarek El Moussa and his wife, Heather Rae El Moussa, competing against Haack to see who could make a better profit when flipping a house. Haack's estranged husband, Josh Hall, was originally her partner until he left the series following their July 2024 split. 

Tarek El Moussa said filming the series “was more fun than [he] thought it was going to be.” 

“It was better for our family. It was better for our relationship. It brought everybody closer and, in the end, it did such amazing things for our family. I wouldn't change a thing,” said Tarek El Moussa to the publication. 

He also said that he and Haack were able to positively communicate with each other during the production of the show. 

“The show gave me and Christina an opportunity to apologize for things we did to each other. It gave Christina and Heather an opportunity to bond even closer. I mean, we're going to dinners now. So, honestly, it's just about working together, spending time together and creating some really fun TV together,” said Tarek El Moussa during the interview. 

A post shared by Tarek El Moussa (@therealtarekelmoussa)

Tarek El Moussa spoke about filming with Haack for “The Flip Off” during a January 2025 Us Weekly interview, alongside his wife. He said he was not worried about working with his ex-wife again because they have “been in a really good place” for “the last couple of years.” 

“It took us almost 10 years to get there, so going back into shooting together, it's a lot more of an intimate relationship. There were some reservations. But as the show has gone on, we've realized it's just business,” said Tarek El Moussa during the interview. 

He also said that he and Haack did argue while filming the HGTV series. According to Tarek El Moussa, he took issue with Haack “because she always wants to get her way.” 

“She doesn't want to have rules,” said Tarek El Moussa to Us Weekly.

Heather Rae El Moussa also shared that he and Haack's dynamic is similar to how siblings fight.

A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa)

During a November 2024 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Haack said Hall took issue with her dynamic with Tarek El Moussa while filming “The Flip Off.” 

According to Haack, Hall viewed her relationship with her ex-husband as flirty. She said, however, that she views Tarek El Moussa like a sibling.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Katy Perry is Going to Space (So Can You)","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/katy-perry-goes-to-space/","Sun, 13 Apr 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Singer Katy Perry is counting the minutes til she blasts off into space.

Monday, April 14, Perry will be aboard the Blue Origin rocket ship “New Shepherd-31,” alongside an an all-female crew that includes talk show host Gayle King, and Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos' fiancée Lauren Sánchez. Former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen and film producer Kerianne Flynn round out the six woman crew.

But if you think you have to be a pop star or a talk show host to climb aboard a rocketship, think again!

Blue Origin's New Shepherd is taking reservations for future flights and promising passengers their very own window seat.

A post shared by Blue Origin (@blueorigin)

A post shared by Blue Origin (@blueorigin)

According to the Blue Origin website, the New Shepherd flies itself. Which means all six women will be flying purely as passengers when the rocket lifts off some time after the launch window opens Monday morning at 8:30a.m. CT/9:30a.m. ET. 

The rocket will travel at more than three times the speed of sound, passing the Kármán line, which is the internationally recognized boundary of space 62 miles above the earth. Once they reach space, the six women will achieve weightlessness and can unbuckle and float around the rocket, looking out windows at the earth below.

They'll have about four minutes to take it all in before coming back down to earth under parachutes.

Past passengers aboard the New Shepherd have described it as “eye-opening” and “enlightening,” with Karsen Kitchen of the NS-26 flight last year saying she's “forever changed” by the experience.

Katy Perry, Gayle King and Lauren Sánchez are far from the first celebrities to fly to space in a Blue Origin rocket. Star Trek legend William Shatner became the oldest person to go to space at age 90 when he was a passenger on New Shepherd-18 in October 2021. Writing about it for Variety, Shatner said, “I discovered that the beauty isn't out there, it's down here, with all of us. Leaving that behind made my connection to our tiny planet even more profound.”

“Good Morning America” host Michael Strahan also breached the Kármán line in 2021, calling it “unreal” and better than he expected.

A post shared by Blue Origin (@blueorigin)

Blue Origin advertises the chance for anyone to book a seat on the New Shepherd on its website, with the slogan “join a new generation of astronauts” and a button underneath to “purchase your seat.”

Clicking that button takes you to a form to fill out with name, address and even a section titled “Tell Us About You.”

At the very bottom of that form with a box to check when you apply, it says, “I acknowledge Blue Origin will collect a $150,000 USD fully refundable deposit to begin the order process.” Note the word “deposit.” Blue Origin doesn't publicly state the price of a ticket aboard New Shepherd, negotiating privately with each passenger, according to The New York Times.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Hallmark Star Posts Video of Her Dog's Wild Night After Finding Bag of Edibles: ‘Stoned Out'","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/genevieve-angelson-dog-took-sleep-edibles/","Sun, 13 Apr 2025 15:11:00 GMT","

No dogs were harmed in the making of a hilarious Instagram video that Hallmark star Genevieve Angelson shared on April 9, 2025. In the reel, “The Chicken Sisters” actress held her “stoned out” dog, Jack, in her lap as they sat in a 24-hour veterinary hospital. 

In the midst of filming the second season of “The Chicken Sisters” in Vancouver, Angelson had to rush Jack to get seen after realizing he'd “literally opened a drawer and ate through a bag, adding every kind of dimensional meaning to the term Snoop Dogg,” she wrote in her caption. 

Angelson was able to laugh about the situation knowing that her pup wasn't harmed — just dazed and confused. Despite him looking bleary-eyed and barely able to hold his head up, Angelson assured fans that “JACK IS 100% OKAY.”

A post shared by Genevieve (@genevieveangelson)

Angelson, who appeared on multiple series including “The Handsmaid's Tale” and “New Amsterdam” before landing her role as Mae on “The Chicken Sisters” in 2024, took the video to send to a friend while at the emergency vet with Jack, but decided it was “too cinematic to keep to myself.” 

Noting that it was 10:15 p.m. in Vancouver, she said, “I am about to leave the 24-hour emergency veterinary hospital,” and panned the camera to show Jack in her lap, with his head leaning way back, clearly out of it. 

Trying to stifle her laughter, she said, “Jack ate 20 milligrams of THC that he pulled out of a drawer, in a Ziploc bag, where I had three-and-a-half five-milligram sleep edibles. And now he's being hospitalized, where he's going to be hydrated, given charcoal, 35 bags of Doritos and he will be fine.”

Showing Jack's lifeless body again, with him wrapped in a towel and staring into space, Angelson giggled, “But if I have to look at this — the most stoned thing that I have ever (seen). I have been sobbing for so long.” 

When Jack suddenly popped his head up momentarily, Angelson joked, “Oh! Listening to Pink Floyd in there, bro?”  

In her caption, Angelson quipped, “We will be spending the day eating takis and watching Bojack Horseman” and then, on a serious note, thanked the vet staff for taking such good care of Jack. 

“A million thanks to the extraordinary team at  @burrardanimalhospitalemergency and @vincenza007 for coming to the rescue.”

This is not Jack's first big medical adventure. In 2023, Angelson chronicled a confusing and gruesome turn of events when her pup, named after actor Jack Lemmon, developed huge sores on his foot that turned out to be caused by a foxtail lodged inside his ankle. This situation, however, proved to be much funnier. 

A post shared by Genevieve (@genevieveangelson)

Angelson's latest post about Jack's unexpected “trip” drew a flood of responses from fans, friends, and multiple members of “The Chicken Sisters” cast. 

Rukiya Bernard, who plays Sabrina on the show, wrote, “Oh my god. I'm dying!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂”

When Angelson replied to her, “NOT A GREAT NIGHT,” Bernard quipped, “Maybe for you. Pup looks happy as Snoop”

Ektor Rivera, who plays Sergio on the series, chimed in, “What a rookie move by Jack! Hope he feels better soon 🙂 Cute dog, but ain't no Snoop Dogg 🐶💤”

Angelson joked to him, “total lightweight”

Other commenters sympathized with Jack (“been there”) and with Angelson for having to go through the experience. But many left funny responses, including one who said Jack looked “comfortably numb,” another who wrote “at least he can take a break from thinkin' about the state of the world ;o)” and someone else who joked, “That same thing happened to me except I ate Fritos”

Jack's relieved mom can currently be seen in the first season of “The Chicken Sisters,” which premiered on Hallmark+ in the fall but is now airing for the first time on Hallmark Channel every Sunday night at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","HGTV Fans Thrilled About Star's Just-Announced Return","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/scott-mcgillivray-vacation-house-rules-2025/","Sun, 13 Apr 2025 04:11:36 GMT","

HGTV has packed its April 2025 schedule with new shows, from kicking off the sixth season of “Rock the Block” to debuting the new series “Castle Impossible.” 

On April 4, the network added one more surprise to the schedule: a new season of “Vacation House Rules” with real estate investor and contractor Scott McGillivray and his designer, Debra Salmoni — music to the ears of fans in the U.S. who have wondered whether the Canadian-based show would air again on HGTV. 

Season 6 of “Vacation House Rules” is already scheduled to premiere on Canada's new Home Network on April 7. For U.S. fans, HGTV now says it will debut on April 26. 

A post shared by HGTV (@hgtv)

Fans were thrilled to see the news of Scott McGillivray's return on HGTV's social media accounts, given that there hadn't been any status updates on the shows since it last aired in the spring of 2024. Thousands liked and commented on the post. 

“I absolutely love Scott's show & any show he is on or hosts,” one person wrote on Facebook. “He so knowledgeable & so genuine. He's a wonderful host, am so happy he's back!!!!! ❤️❤️”

Another wrote, “I enjoy Scott and Debra so much! They have a great chemistry. Glad to see them back!”

On Instagram, one fan gushed, “😊😊This is GREAT news! LOVE, LOVE his show!” while numerous others called it “the best show ever 😍.”

A post shared by Scott McGillivray (@scott_mcgillivray)

In “Vacation House Rules,” McGillivray renovates vacation homes alongside designer and friend Debra Salmoni. Together, the duo transform spaces in ways that will help their clients create new revenue streams by renting out the getaways. Filmed in Ontario, the series typically premieres in Canada weeks before making its way to U.S. airwaves.

McGillivray, who is married with two daughters, first appeared on HGTV Canada on “Income Property” in 2009. He's also helmed the Canadian series “Moving the McGillivrays,” “Buyers Bootcamp,” and “Renovation Resort Showdown” with his longtime friend and fellow HGTV star Bryan Baeumler. In 2024, he pitched in on HGTV's “100 Day Hotel Challenge” with Brian and Mika Kleinschmidt. 

On April 3, McGillivray told CTV that he's grateful for every chance he gets to keep doing what he loves.

“I like fixing things, that's what I love to do,” he told the outlet. “So, fortunately for me, I get to get up every day find something wrong and try to fix it, whether it's a real estate challenge or a renovation challenge or a design challenge. You know, I've been kind of blessed to be able to share that with everybody throughout the shows for so many years.”

With Wall Street in a tailspin over President Trump's global tariff war, it's no wonder that a few blocks north, at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the writers and producers of “Saturday Night Live” might be feeling that same shock. And while one of the show's jobs is to satirize current events, there are times when “SNL” is hindered by its need to serve as reflection of current events more than an escape from them — providing laughs on one of the few nights of the week people are supposed to be kicking back and having fun. Unfortunately, such was the case for Jon Hamm‘s fourth round hosting at Studio 8H, though, as his monologue laid out, he has appeared for multiple cameos in the 15 years since his last time as headliner, including during the “SNL 50 Anniversary Special.”
 








Related Stories Brandon Sklenar Is Open to Return for Next Installment of ‘Yellowstone' Prequel Series: ‘I'll Gravel the Voice Up a Bit' ‘Yellowjackets' Unveils Its Antler Queen Once and for All — and the Answer Was Always in Front of Us 

Moving past the monologue, which featured a surprise cameo from Oscar-winner Kieran Culkin — currently performing in “Glengarry Glen Ross” on Broadway — Hamm's first sketch of the evening was a TV news set-up anchored around business programming for people who live “Check to Check.” Obviously, the set-up was inspired by the current economic woes facing many who barely have the funds for groceries, let alone playing around within the market. Though funny initially, when you take a second to process it, the sketch feels like it's laughing at those who are suffering rather than those who are causing it. At the same time, there is something very real about smiling through the train wreck that we've all been forced to experience.

As someone who watches a fair amount of TV with commercials, the pre-taped “Medication Ad” from last night's “SNL” was right on the money. Not only does it perfectly capture the standard formula that's been applied to nearly every medication advertisement over the last 10-15 years, but by having Hamm deliver the pitch, we might just have gotten a taste of the kind of work Don Draper would be doing in present day. 

Two Trump bits in one evening? Yea, we were none too pleased either. After the cold open served as yet another opportunity for James Austin Johnson to do his weekly check-in on all of Trump's latest escapades, viewers were treated to yet another bit centered around our ignoramus-in-chief. Pre-taped this time and featuring appearances by past cast members Beck Bennett as Vladimir Putin and Alex Moffat as Eric Trump, as well as a brief cameo by Scarlett Johansson as Ivanka Trump, “The White Potus” is (quite obviously) a play on the recently wrapped Season 3 of the hit HBO series. A cultural clash that blends well in concept, but not in execution, the best part of this bit is how it strips the world's current power players down-to-size and gives a ton of cast members a moment to shine. Hamm's combination of Health and Human Services Secretary RFK, Jr. and Walton Goggins' Rick from “The White Lotus” was particularly amusing, as was Sarah Sherman's take on Aimee Lou Woods' Chelsea.

 










For the first time this season, Colin Jost and Michael Che's performance at the Weekend Update desk didn't always land, however, appearances by Bowen Yang as China's Trade Ambassador Chen Biao and Emil Wakim lamenting the current state of America really helped pep things up toward the back half of the episode. Yang's Biao has appeared multiple times before and never fails to disappoint, but with our current 145 percent tariff on China, the character was really in top form and put into focus the notion that this economic strategy is going to hurt America most. Meanwhile, Wakim's moment in the spotlight proved why the featured player is worth keeping around, as his humor was not only biting, but incisive in a way that hearkened back to Update anchor Norm MacDonald.

“What About Bob?” starring Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss remains one of the comedies from the 1990s that continues to delight fans and newcomers alike, but getting the film made wasn't exactly a pile of laughs. Between Murray throwing a glass that shattered near Dreyfuss to needing to shoot multiple endings, production experienced many obstacles on the way to the big screen. Speaking for a recent oral history conducted by Rolling Stone Magazine, the film's director, Frank Oz, shared how much of these rumors, in his opinion, have been conflated, but at the same time, everyone has their own experience under the circumstances they faced.

“Look, every set has a culture and a dynamic of its own, and there I have had difficulties,” he said. “Those bad situations are cracking me up because they show our frailty as human beings and our imperfections […] the egos and the fears, the insecurities when you get in a crucible that's so pressurized. Making a movie like this, we're talking about millions and millions and millions of dollars. We're talking about stars believing that it better work, because the next paycheck won't be good if it doesn't. Richard Dreyfuss was not trying to be bad. Everybody believes they're doing the best thing for the movie and they're trying their very best. That doesn't mean that what they're doing is the best for the movie, but they honestly believe it.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






Dreyfuss also spoke to Rolling Stone for the piece and still seemed bitter over how “What About Bob?” was made, particularly in relation to Oz's quality as a director and the mistreatment of the film's late producer, Laura Ziskin. During one particularly tense exchange, Murray apparently broke Zisken's glasses over her inability to secure a day off for the crew on a holiday. While Dreyfuss considered Murray's actions “pretty wacky,” Oz views it as just him being in strong defense of his co-workers.

“I thought at the time he crushed her glasses for personal reasons, but it makes sense to hear it was for the crew,” said Oz. “He really cared about the crew.”

For a long time, Dreyfuss accused Murray of throwing a glass at him on set. Recently, Murray decried these rumors, saying he threw it near the “Jaws” actor. Oz cleared up the narrative, as he was present at the time and has it “etched” into his memory.

 










“I got in a room with Bill and Richard to try and solve a script problem,” Oz said to Rolling Stone. “We had several drafts that various people liked. Bill left the room and came back about 20 minutes later. Bill said something, I'm not sure what it was, but he was obviously in a dark mood. And Richard said, ‘Is that Bill talking or is that Bob Wiley talking?' And I remember Bill grabbing a glass and saying, ‘This is Bill talking.' And he heaved the glass about 10 feet up in the air against a huge high fireplace and glass scattered all over the room. And I remember Richard going, ‘Whoa,' and standing up and leaving.”

Not many would consider this behavior acceptable, but having been in the industry a long time in many different roles, Oz thought it was just part of the process.

“We all have imperfections,” he said. “And they come out when we're in this heightened crucible of making a movie. But when you think of the world outside, we're so lucky that we get to do what we do. We're so lucky, so fortunate. And within this crucible, all this nonsense happens. Looking back, it's just so funny to me.”

Green Day was one of last night's (Saturday, April 12) headliners at the 2025 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, alongside Travis Scott. The set marked the punk trio's debut performance at the Indio, California festival, despite frontman Billie Joe Armstrong joining the Replacements on stage in 2014. Scroll down to check out clips of their performance, and rewind the livestream below to watch it in full.

During their 18-song set, Green Day played hits and fan-favorites spanning 1994's Dookie through their latest album, 2024's Saviors. Armstrong, drummer Tré Cool, and bassist Mike Dirnt kicked things off with a trio of songs from their 2004 record American Idiot, changing one of the title track's lyrics to “I'm not part of the MAGA agenda.” This was one of several politically charged moments throughout the evening, including a rendition of “Jesus of Suburbia” that featured the reworked line “Running away from pain like the kids from Palestine.”

Armstrong & co. also worked a few classic rock references into their set, including a bunny-suited hype man who ran around onstage to Ramones' “Blitzkreig Bop” to herald the band's arrival. Later on, “Hitchin' a Ride” teased the riff to Black Sabbath's “Iron Man,” and “Wake Me Up When September Ends” opened with a few bars from Tom Petty's “Free Fallin'.” Continuing a long-standing tradition, the band invited one fan onstage to help sing “Know Your Enemy,” and another to play acoustic guitar on closing number “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).”

Green Day announced Saviors back in the fall of 2023, releasing their zombie-filled black-and-white video for “The American Dream Is Killing Me” that same day. They also shared the singles “Look Ma, No Brains!” and “Dilemma” during the rollout. The LP follows the band's 2020 full-length Father of All…

Clairo had an unexpected guest for fans on Saturday night at Coachella: Just before her set began, Bernie Sanders came out for a moment of political activism in the desert. The Vermont Senator, who was in California for an anti-oligarchy rally earlier in the day, encouraged the crowd to fight for the country, warning of the dire consequences the country faces if people remain apathetic.


	Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost came onstage first to introduce Sanders. “We're living in some crazy times, and because of that, I'm here to introduce someone very special,” he said before welcoming Sanders. Sanders thanked him, saying, “The youngest member [of Congress] — and in my view — one of the best members,” as the two lifted their hands up together.


	Then, Sanders dove into a serious political speech, lambasting the Trump administration, Elon Musk, and the current state of the nation. “This country faces some very difficult challenges,” he said. “The future of what happens to America is dependent upon your generation. Now, you can turn away and ignore what goes on but if you do that, you do it on your own peril. We need you to stand up and fight for justice, to fight for economic justice, racial justice and social justice.”

	











	He spoke forcefully against the current administration's agenda and decisions. “Now, we've got a president of the United States…” Sanders started to say, and was quickly met with boos as people recognized that he was talking about Trump. “I agree,” he told the crowd, the continued: “He thinks that climate change is a hoax. He is dangerously wrong, and you and I are going to hav to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and tell them to stop destroying this planet.”

	After encouraging fans to demand better healthcare and economic opportunities, he introduced Clairo and shouted out her own social justice work. “I'm here because Clairo has used her prominence to fight for women's rights, to try to end the terrible, brutal war in Gaza, where thousands of women and children are being killed,” he said. “So I want to thank Clairo not only for being in a great band, but for the great work she is doing.”

	Clairo has long supported Bernie, sharing that he chose him in the Democratic primaries back in 2020. She's also been vocal about Trump. On the day of Trump's inauguration, Clairo made headlines after she tweeted, “Witchcraft on Trump ASAP!” after expressing her distaste for the politician many times before. After he won the election, she shared her anger about the changes that would come to the country.

	““I'm full of so much sadness and rage today… I'm so fucing tired of people talking about fucing bodies,” she said at the time. “You're a fucking weirdo if you want to make a decision about my fucking body. It's really heavy on my heart today.”

Mickey Rourke has “agreed to leave” the U.K.'s Celebrity Big Brother following an incident with a house mate that was separate from his “homophobic” remarks to JoJo Siwa.


	On Saturday, a spokesperson for the ITV, which airs the show, said in a statement, “Mickey Rourke has agreed to leave the Celebrity Big Brother House this evening following a discussion with Big Brother regarding further use of inappropriate language and instances of unacceptable behavior.”


	According to the Independent, Rourke had an encounter with a fellow house mate — Love Island's Chris Hughes — that “was considered to be threatening and aggressive.” However, “no physical altercation took place”; the confrontation between Rourke and Hughes has not yet aired on the show. 


	That incident was the latest in a series of Rourke-related issues in the Celebrity Big Brother house, with the actor also accused of ogling the show's co-host AJ Odudu and offending another house mate (actress Donna Preston) with comments about her weight.

	However, Rourke's exploits in the U.K. reached an international audience with his remarks aimed at Siwa, who is openly gay. Rourke's interactions with Siwa were laced with “offensive and unacceptable” language, and producers ultimately stepped in with a warning that “further language or behavior of this nature could lead to you being removed from the Big Brother house.”


	In one interaction, Rourke asked Siwa if she was interested in boys or girls, to which Siwa responded, “Girls. My partner is non-binary.” Rourke then told Siwa, “If I stay longer than four days, you won't be gay anymore,” to which she replied, “I can guarantee I'll still be gay and I'll still be in a very happy relationship.”


	On another occasion, Rourke said en route to the Big Brother smoking section that “I need a fag” — British slang for a cigarette — but then pointed to Siwa and said, “I'm not talking to you.” Rourke also openly strategized on the reality competition that he was “going to vote the lesbian out real quick.”

	Following the producers' warning, Rourke was apologetic. “I apologize. I don't have dishonorable intentions. I'm just talking smack, you know. I wasn't taking it all so serious. I didn't mean any bad intentions and if I did, sorry,” he told producers. The actor also apologized to Siwa, saying, “I've got a habit of having a short fuse. And I don't mean nothing by it. I do mean it [sorry]. If I didn't, I wouldn't say it to you.” Siwa replied, “I appreciate your apology.”

	











	However, Rourke's smack-talking continued to bristle his other house mates, leading to his departure from the Celebrity Big Brother house Saturday.

Donald Trump's administration has engaged in persistent mass firings over the past three months — affecting various critical agencies and putting their future in question. One agency that has been significantly impacted is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Within NOAA, the National Weather Service has been thrown into turmoil, and experts argue this could threaten the reliability of America's weather forecasting system.


	The weather app you use? It almost certainly relies on the observational data that NOAA collects from dozens of doppler radars across the U.S., geostationary satellites, its weather balloon network, surface stations, buoys out in the ocean and more. If NOAA can't operate at its usual levels, the forecasts you get from that app could become a lot less accurate.


	These weather forecasts are critical for the transportation industry and many other industries. It's also important to be able to accurately predict the weather when severe weather events threaten communities across the nation.

	











	“You're talking about threats to life and property. This is a place where you don't want to make mistakes,” says David Stensrud, a professor of meteorology and atmospheric science at Penn State. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	NOAA and the National Weather Service have been disrupted by the Trump administration in various ways, and things may continue to get worse as firings and budget cuts continue. Weather balloon launches are being reduced across the country, some technology updates are on hold, there are concerns about maintaining the tornado and hurricane warning systems, and more. Recently, the administration released a budget that would massively cut weather and climate research. 


	“Weather balloons are not being launched at all of these sites due to staffing cuts,” Stensrud says. “Those go into our operational weather prediction models, and they're important contributors to those models. The loss of [weather balloons] is going to decrease forecast skill. Over time, the fear is that forecasts will not be as good as they were before.”

	Richard Rood, a professor emeritus of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan, says the balloon measurements are “surprisingly important.”

	











	“They can look at the [balloon measurements] and see if the model has missed some extreme local event,” Rood says. “We've lost data that often helps us understand a system that the global model is not able to resolve.”


	One significant problem is the loss of human forecasters, Rood says, because they're able to look at these models and use their expertise to interpret what may be coming in the near future. If there are fewer of them working in the federal government, things could get missed.


	“The potential for missing a low-probability, high-risk event is increasing, and you're increasing the fragmentation of an already fragmented organization, which I think will have consequences,” Rood says.


	Stensrud says that NOAA and other agencies could certainly be more effective, but the way that Trump and Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency is going about its staffing and budget cuts doesn't appear to be well thought-out. Recent polling indicates that many Americans believe Trump and DOGE are rushing this process. 


	“Every agency can become more efficient, but that's usually something that takes time to think through,” says Stensrud. “It's not something that happens, wisely, in a matter of days.”

	Thanks to the effects of climate change, severe weather events are becoming more common every year. Hurricanes, flooding, heat waves, wildfires, and more pose an increasingly severe threat to human life, and people need to be warned about them as early as possible. 


	“When severe weather happens, offices will bring in a lot of staff to manage all that has to happen to get warnings out to the public,” Stensrud says. “When staff is at minimum levels, you're putting a lot of stress on those people.”


	Furthermore, it's not clear that the work DOGE is doing will in any way reduce government spending — one of its stated goals. The entire National Weather Service has a budget of around $1.5 billion, and the work the agency does saves the country tens of billions of dollars. 


	“The U.S. spends about a dollar out of every $100 investing in non-defense science. Some of that's NOAA,” Stensrud says. “Some of that's the National Science Foundation. Some of that's the [National Institutes of Health]. It's not a very big investment.”

	It appears the weather forecasting models will continue to operate relatively effectively for now, but Rood says they could begin to degrade before the year is over. If things continue to get worse for these agencies, the risks increase. 

	











	Next time you get unexpectedly caught in the rain, you can thank DOGE.

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update took on Donald Trump‘s whiplash actions on tariffs, Elon Musk‘s attempt to get the president to back down, and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.‘s crusade against fluoride in public drinking water, among his other anti-science actions.


	Co-anchor Colin Jost joked about one social media post Trump had made this week trying to soothe nerves as markets were falling.


	“Just hours before Trump paused the tariffs, he tried to calm investors by posting, ‘Be cool, everything is going to work out well,'” Jost recalled. “Be cool? This is the global economy. It's not like we got too high and we're trying to get through dinner with our parents.”


Michael Che riffed on a similar Trump comment.


	“Trump responded to the fallout from his tariffs saying sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” he said. “Yeah, but this feels like we took a whole bottle of medicine with a glass of vodka and laid in a warm bath.”

	











	Che then noted how Musk last weekend made a personal appeal to Trump to back off on the tariffs.

	“It worked. The stock market went up like this,” Che joked, imitating Musk's infamous salute from a few months ago, which many likened to a Nazi Sieg Heil.


	As for Kennedy Jr., who reportedly intends on instructing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to call for an end to cavity-preventing fluoride in public drinking water, Jost joked that the vaccine skeptic has an alternative: that the health agency “start recommending veneers for kids.”

	The energy at Coachella had started to shift even before Green Day's long-awaited headlining set on Saturday night. About an hour earlier, Charli XCX had sent the crowd into an all-out frenzy with a set that included surprise appearances from Lorde, Billie Eilish, and Troye Sivan. Then, before Clairo started playing at the Outdoor Theatre, Bernie Sanders came out and made a passionate political speech, urging festival-goers to fight for the country and avoid apathy. 


	All of that meant that by the time the California rockers took the stage, the crowd was completely fired up and ready to lose it. After a quick countdown, they dove headfirst into a high-voltage rendition of “American Idiot,” all while fans screamed along to every word. Led by frontman Billie Joe Armstrong, the rock outfit continued its tradition of changing the lyrics of the line “I'm not a part of a redneck agenda,” making it “I'm not part of the MAGA agenda,” adding a political undertone to the performance.

	











	Save for a couple of moments, there were no political overtures or lengthy speeches. The band's messages are embedded into the music already, and their main goal for the night seemed to be to get the audience rocking out as hard as humanly possible, especially because it was their first time at the festival (Armstrong had performed with the Replacements in 2014, and played with The Go-Gos on Friday.) They largely succeeded. When they launched into “Know Your Enemy,” Armstrong looked into the mass of screaming fans jumping up and down to the music. “I need a special guest right now,” he said, pointing to someone in the crowd. “I'm coming down right now.” Within seconds, he found a fan who knew the words and brought her onstage, where she sang along with him, a little stunned and teary. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The whole setlist unfolded like a career-spanning, best-of montage, packed with hits that crisscrossed the decades. There was “Brain Stew” and “Boulevard of Broken Dreams,” but one of the peaks of the performance came when Green Day kicked off a thrashing version of “Minority,” followed by “Basket Case” and “When I Come Around.” It was a back-to-back wallop that served as a reminder of the band's longevity and staying power through the years.

	They briefly slowed things down by covering a few bars of Tom Petty's “Free Fallin'” as a mini-precursor to the weepy rock ballad “Wake Me Up When September Ends” from 2004. To make sure the energy didn't dip too much, Armstrong leaped into “Jesus of Suburbia”n right after, eliciting a sing-a-long from the crowd. Armstrong added more political commentary into the set by tweaking a line from the track and singing “runnin' away from pain like the kids from Palestine,” earning cheers from the audience. 


	During “Bobby Sox,” from the band's most recent album Saviors, confetti rained down on the audience and Armstrong thanked the crowd repeatedly. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” he shouted. “What an unbelievable night.” It seemed like the show would end there, but they had one more trick left: Armstrong called up a random dude from the audience who swore he could play guitar and had him play  the classic “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).” The guy delivered and played while Armstrong sang, closing the set on a poignant note. The band said goodbye and ended their debut with fireworks and pyrotechnics – all while the crowd kept cheering their name over and over.

Saturday Night Live host Jon Hamm and Ego Nwodim, co-hosts of CTCBC (Check-to-Check Business News Channel), gave tips on how such consumers can adjust their buying practices in light of Donald Trump's tariffs raising prices. 


	Hamm, introducing himself as Kenneth, offered a relevant fact about himself: “And this suit is from Kohl's.”


	“Markets are in turmoil,” he said. “Let's check on the S&P 500, which is down 2.38 percent. The NASDAQ composite is down 265 points. And Dow Industrials are down 2.88 percent. Okay. Does that mean anything to anyone?”


	“I'm sure it means something to someone, but sounds like a bunch of gibberish to me,” co-host Tasia replied, pointing to something more appropriate for their channel: “Take a look at boxed mac and cheese, which is up 4.5 percent to $1.59.”


	“Also,” she added, “big-ass box of Bisquick is up from $2.39 to too damn much. And candy bars are up from ‘sure, baby' to ‘put that back!'”

	











	After Kenneth noted that Americans are spending $0 on doctor visits, his colleague noted one investment: “health care alternatives such as ‘Just go lay down,' ‘Take an Advil,' and ‘Pray it goes away.'”


	The two then turned to correspondent David Hayes (Kenan Thompson) for advice on alternatives to imported goods.


	“You can work around them if you're smart. For example, I occasionally like Perrier water from France. Instead, I drink this American version: Uncle Bubbles,” he said. “Even domestic products will experience some fluctuations. I used to eat Cap'n Crunch cereal. Today I buy this: Sergeant Munch. Lower rank, lower price, flavor bad.”


	A substitute for DiGiorno's, he added, was pizza made by his cousin: “DeVonte.”


	Back behind the anchor's desk, Hayes' colleagues said sarcastically that the money they saved would go towards their student loan debt.

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) disclosed a chilling dossier that detailed a purported massacre by five aliens from a crashed UFO who transformed a whole military regiment into stone.

The new report claims that Soviet soldiers shot down an alien craft that was circling over the Soviet military unit in Siberia.

Witnesses claimed that five aliens stepped out of their destroyed craft, united into a single entity, erupted in a burst of incredible energy, and transformed 23 troops into solid rock. The document summarized a 250-page confidential file obtained by the US intelligence officers.

One CIA source described the startling clash as “a picture that makes one's blood freeze, a horrific picture of revenge on the part of extraterrestrial creatures,” Daily Mail reported.

The agency went on to say that the “extremely menacing case” demonstrated that the alien visitors had technology and weapons much beyond what the US government had assumed, implying that they knew about the aliens' presence beforehand.

Josh Hooper, host of the AI or Evil podcast, recently discussed the exposed document, which was released in 2000. He disclosed that two of the combatants at the UFO crash site truly experienced the ordeal.

However, there was no way to rescue the 23 “petrified soldiers.” According to reports, their remains were transferred to a covert research facility close to Moscow, along with the spacecraft's debris.

The detailed description of the alleged aliens engaged in this horrific act, is an even more alarming aspect of the CIA file.

“Paper reports alleged evidence on mishap involving UFO,” reads the document's subject line.

On March 27, 1993, the Ukrainian publication Holos Ukrayiny released this stunning story.

A Canadian publication claimed that the incident occurred between 1989 and 1990, and then CIA discovered it only after the collapse of Soviet Union.

The two surviving troops claim that the five aliens released themselves from the rubble and gathered near the wreck when the soldiers got closer to the craft.

The aliens, according to the soldiers, then “merged into a single object that acquired a spherical shape”, which seemed like a gigantic ball, as per Daily Mail.

Under the relentless Louisiana sun, a spectacle unfolds - part rodeo, part reckoning. 

Beneath a sky heavy with humidity, prisoners grip the reins of wild horses, their bodies jolted and thrown as they face down charging bulls. 

Crowds from across the nation are preparing to gather again this month to witness a raw, gladiator-style spectacle - the last prison rodeo in America. 

Although outlawed across the country, this event endures in Louisiana, the state with the world's highest incarceration rate. 

Branded as the 'South's wildest clash' and marketed as a rehabilitation gem, it unfolds on the sprawling grounds of Angola, Louisiana's state penitentiary, a site stitched together from former slave plantations. 

Black people, roughly a third of Louisiana's population, account for 80 percent of Angola's inmates - a place named for the African nation tied to its enslaved past. 

At this maximum-security prison, where most serve life sentences, new laws under Governor Jeff Landry have ended parole and cut early release, trapping them within its 18,000 acres.

The rodeo, that usually runs in April and October, brings in $450,000 each weekend it runs, yet for prisoners, the real draw is simpler: a fleeting connection to the outside world, a sliver of cash, and a rare moment to see their loved ones beyond the bars. The next event is on April 26 and 27.

Founded in 1965, just months after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the Angola Prison Rodeo has become a deeply rooted tradition in southern Louisiana, obscuring the harsher realities of life behind bars.

Initially conceived as a joint effort between incarcerated individuals, prison staff, and Angola's civilian residents, the first two rodeos in 1965 and 1966 were closed to the public. 

By 1967, limited tickets were made available, with proceeds benefiting the Inmate Welfare Fund, which supports recreational and educational programs for prisoners.

Early spectators watched from pickup trucks or brought their own seating to view the small event. 

But as its popularity surged, the penitentiary constructed a 4,500-seat arena in 1969. Today, the rodeo draws such massive crowds that a newer arena now holds more than 10,000 attendees.

The Angola Museum website stresses that 'inmate participation is entirely voluntary', and that 'many offenders see the rodeo as a rare opportunity to feel a part of society outside of the gates and take pride in showcasing their talents'.  

Still, several petitions are found across the internet calling for the state to abolish the event, but none have made it to the prison warden or state legislators. 

In recent decades, Oklahoma, Texas, and Mississippi have all ended their prison rodeos for profit's sake - though Oklahoma's GOP lawmakers recently voted to revive them.

The prison itself is plagued with a dark past. Once dubbed America's bloodiest prison, it claimed lives yearly - 100 are reportedly buried in levees they were helping to build along the Mississippi River.

After slavery was abolished, plantations shifted to convict leasing, forcing black people jailed for minor offenses - like straying onto the wrong road - into labor. 

By the late 1800s, Louisiana bought the Angola plantation, converting it into a prison.

On a typical day at Angola, a former plantation turned prison behemoth, inmates grind through brutal labor - clearing land, farming crops for global brands - earning next to nothing.

Herman Wallace, one of the Angola 3 - Black Panther Party members who faced over 40 years in solitary - labeled the prison not just a jail, but 'an institution crafted to crush men'. 

Numerous inmates, their identities shielded by Capital B News due to prison rules, described toiling in scorching heat without adequate care or breaks, leading to about 50 early deaths each year. 

Today, the prison churns out millions in crops - soy, corn, cotton - found in Frosted Flakes and Coke, powered by forced labor, unique to Louisiana's laws. 

The rodeo fuses classic events - bull riding, bronco busting, barrel racing, and steer wrestling - with perilous twists unique to Angola. 

For instance, in Convict Poker, four 'rodeo workers', the prisoners volunteering in the show, sit at a table as a raging bull storms toward them; the last one seated claims the win.

Prisoner Pinball pits participants inside hula hoops against an erratic bull, the prize awarded to whoever stays rooted in their circle. 

The climax, Guts and Glory, sends inmates scrambling to grab a poker chip lashed to a towering longhorn's head, courting danger for a cash reward.

Angola acknowledges the raw, hazardous nature of these contests but insists they're overseen by veteran handlers. 

Rodeo clowns, skilled at redirecting bulls, leap into action, while inmates don protective gear and medics wait in the wings, per the prison's website.

Still, the safeguards don't erase the reality: fractured bones and crushed spines fuel the chaos, sustaining this divisive tradition's dark allure.

Though the prison rodeo harks back to a dark American era, inmates call it 'one of the better days'. 

Beyond the arena, dozens sell handmade art, leather, and woodwork - some behind guarded fences, most in the open, sharing hugs and laughs with family. 

In those fleeting moments, they shed the labels of 'convicts' or mere objects, emerging as creators and contributors, carving out their humanity and identity within a system bent on stripping both away. 

Earnings can reach $2,000 yearly for competitors, minus the prison's 22 percent take. 

Troy Grimes, attending the rodeo as a free man nine months after his release, told Capital B he remains torn, returning to see friends still inside. 

'The prison and this prison rodeo is one of the most powerful political tools that is used to stereotype [black people] and normalize our negative environments,' he said.

He spoke yearly with inmates about the rodeo's backwardness, but its role as the only event offering free outside connection and extra money kept them in. 

'Here you see how politics and money defines how we're seen and what we accept,' Grimes said.

He understands its draw for inmates: cash and contact. 

'I came back to support the guys, kick it with them, and to spend a little money with them, because a lot of these guys, I'm gonna say 90 percent of these guys, don't have any income coming in, don't have family supporting them,' he said. 

Still, he marveled, 'But, I'm like, wow. My people - black people inside here and out - are supporting this?' 

He said he doubts the $2million yearly take from the events benefits inmates, despite state claims it supports education, trades, and hospice. 

'When I was in here, it was a different ball game, but now when I look at it, I'm like how are we giving these politicians and the state all this money? Why is anybody outside of these fences supporting this?'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

These are the best movies from the production company that rules the modern horror landscape


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Over the past 15 years or so, the name Blumhouse has become synonymous with successful, crowd-pleasing horror movies.

The company run by producer Jason Blum is behind some of the biggest horror hits of recent years and is known for reaching massive audiences with relatively cost-efficient productions. That has allowed Blumhouse to give acclaimed filmmakers like Jordan Peele, Mike Flanagan and Scott Derrickson substantial creative freedom on their projects, while still turning a profit.

The company has expanded into streaming-exclusive films, thanks to its long-term deal with Amazon, and has taken over iconic franchises like “Halloween” and “The Exorcist.” Blumhouse has even occasionally branched out beyond horror, with movies like the Oscar-winning dramas “Whiplash” and “BlacKkKlansman.”

With the latest Blumhouse thriller ""Drop"" newly released in theaters this week, here's a rundown of the best genre movies the company has produced thus far.

When the trailer for this campy horror-comedy about a killer robot was first released, it seemed like it might be trying too hard to create viral online moments. While “M3GAN” successfully inspired numerous memes, it also succeeds as a movie, with an effective balance of self-aware humor and genuine suspense.

The title character is an artificially intelligent android doll created by toy designer Gemma (Allison Williams), who tests it on her niece Cady (Violet McGraw) after Cady loses her parents. M3GAN takes protecting Cady a little too seriously, leading to a murderous rampage against anyone she perceives as threatening the young girl's well-being.

M3GAN slays both literally and figuratively, and director Gerard Johnstone knows just when to turn up the violence — and when to turn up the pop songs for a killer dance routine.

Watch on Starz

Blumhouse was instrumental in the comeback of filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan following a pair of big-budget flops, producing three of his movies, including this stealth expansion of the “Unbreakable” universe.

Shyamalan mostly keeps things streamlined for the story of three teenage girls held hostage by a deranged criminal with multiple personalities.

James McAvoy is mesmerizing as Kevin Wendell Crumb, whose “alters” are often at war with each other, divided over the potential emergence of a dangerous persona known as The Beast. McAvoy switches seamlessly among the various alters as Kevin faces off against the three girls, led by the determined Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy).

Shyamalan delivers his trademark twists while building on the superhero deconstruction he began with “Unbreakable,” and would continue in his next film for Blumhouse, “Glass.”

Watch on Tubi

The film that launched Blumhouse as a major force in horror is still one of the company's best, providing a perfect example of making the most of limited resources.

Writer-director Oren Peli's film may have spawned a long-running franchise, but this initial installment is straightforward and concise, following a young couple as they document the potential haunting of their new house.

Micah Sloat and Katie Featherston play the couple who've just moved in together, and the demonic presence functions as a reflection of their fraught relationship dynamic. Micah is excited to try out his new video equipment, but he's often condescending and dismissive about his girlfriend's fears and concerns.

Blum had the smart instinct to pick up Peli's micro-budget film, which famously terrified audiences from its earliest screenings, and the subsequent huge hit made both Blumhouse and “Paranormal Activity” into horror legends.

Watch on Paramount Plus 

Director Christopher Landon, a Blumhouse regular, offers a clever spin on the time-loop genre with this horror-comedy about a college student being stalked by a killer on her birthday.

Every time she's killed, Tree Gelbman (Jessica Rothe) wakes up and has to live the same day all over again, and she can't escape the loop until she solves her own murder.

Rothe is charming as the initially spoiled Tree, who re-evaluates her priorities over the course of the endlessly repeating day, making positive changes in her life at the same time she tracks down her killer.

Landon plays with expectations for both slasher movies and time-loop movies, with stylish death scenes and amusingly memorable supporting characters. He takes a seemingly worn-out premise and makes it feel fresh and fun.

Thanks to Blumhouse's longstanding relationship with Universal, the company has gotten the opportunity to reimagine some of the classic Universal monsters, starting with this take on H.G. Wells's renowned novel from writer-director Leigh Whannell.

Whannell updates the story to the modern day, making the title character into a wealthy, abusive tech mogul who uses his invisibility technology to terrorize his ex-girlfriend Cecilia (Elisabeth Moss). “The Invisible Man” becomes a story about the way that victims of domestic violence are frequently dismissed and disbelieved, as Cecilia fails to convince anyone that the apparently dead Adrian is still tormenting her.

Moss brings emotional intensity to what could have been a silly story, and Whannell matches her by treating the material with care while still offering plenty of shocks and scares. It's an intelligent, well-crafted reinvention of a familiar story.

Watch on Peacock

The Screenlife brand now seems somewhat commonplace, but when “Unfriended” premiered in 2014, the idea of presenting an entire movie via one character's computer screen was daring and even revolutionary.

“Unfriended” remains both the best and the purest representation of the Screenlife approach, rigorously sticking to the video chats and other programs on the laptop of high school student Blaire Lily (Shelley Hennig).

As Blaire chats with her friends online, they become aware of a supernatural presence among them, seeking revenge for a cruel prank perpetrated on another classmate. Tying the ghostly threat to the chat itself elegantly allows “Unfriended” to justify its format, as the characters must stay online in order to defeat their foe.

“Unfriended” is a terrifying horror movie as well as a masterful depiction of the way people interact online, making connections that can easily turn sinister.

Watch on AMC Plus

Jordan Peele's Oscar-winning debut as a writer-director represents Blumhouse at its best, delivering a major box-office hit that combines sophisticated social commentary, wry comedy and intense scares. Peele has gone on to a high-profile auteur career, and his first film showcases his unique talent already fully formed.

Daniel Kaluuya plays Black photographer Chris Washington, who travels to an upscale suburb to meet the family of his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). The visit turns into a nightmare when Chris is drugged and kidnapped, discovering that Rose's outwardly progressive family is part of a diabolical conspiracy.

Peele expertly builds tension while playing on audience expectations, and Kaluuya and Williams capture the characters' shifting perspectives as the truth comes to light. Peele makes incisive points about race and class without ever losing sight of the horror and humor.

Latest News As It Happens Across Torbay

The horse figure on the church roof denoting sanctuary for Royalists 

Reporter: 

The Storyteller


								13 Apr 2025 6:00 PM
							
						

David Hammond and I always have a most interesting time together whenever we head off on one of our trips to make recordings for our South Devon Folklore segment, on his Thursday morning radio show on Riviera FM and the other week's jaunt was no exception.

On this occasion we started off by making a return trip to one of my favourite Dartmoor towns, one that can lay claim to having not one, but two of the more famous ghosts that  local folklore has to offer. 

It's therefore no surprise that it makes a perfect location for one of my Ghost Walks. That's what our recent segments have been about, updating the listeners on some of the research, and stories that have been shared with me over the past year since launching this new branch of my Moors and More Tours business.

Last time we went around Okehampton, following the route I took my guests on, this time it was Chagford.

Whenever I visit, I always make a point of popping in the church and inspecting the memorial stone to Mary Whiddon, the tragic bride who was brutally stabbed to death by a jealous, spurned lover as she exited on the arm of her newlywed husband. 

Over the years, other brides have been encouraged to leave a flower from their bouquets as a tribute to the young girl and I like to see if the tradition is still being upheld. 

Over the past year, there have been some when I've looked, but not on this occasion. Similarly on recent visits, Jay's Grave hasn't had many displays of flowers present either. Maybe it depends on the time of year?

One of the new things that I was able to show David, something that I only discovered recently myself, is perched high up on the apex of the church roof. 

It looks like the figure of a horse, sadly minus its head, and possibly a rider, which put me in mind of the figures that the writer, Stephanie Austin, pointed out to me during our walk around Ashburton, ahead of our joint venture at Halloween last year. They date from the time of the English Civil War and allegedly announced the fact that the building upon which it stood was a safe haven for any supporters of the Royalist cause, fighting for their king. 

This makes sense, for it was to Chagford that the comrades of Sydney Godolphin, brought him after he was badly wounded during a skirmish at nearby Blackstone Brook. sadly, he never made it to the sanctuary of the church, dying from his wounds in the porch of The Three Crowns, instead. A place he is still said to haunt to this day.

Exiting the churchyard, where, one evening we were met by a herd of ponies grazing around the tombstones, we entered a little alleyway between shops and houses that is said to be the haunt of the Chagford Strangler. 

Once, a young girl's body was found at this spot, having been strangled to death. Ever since then, certain sensitive people have picked up on the sensations of hands around their throat, and a tightness in their chests, as though they are reliving the victim's last moments. As my guests pass through this spot, I ask them if they can sense anything, and on occasions some of them do.

As we approach the public toilets at The Pepperpot in The Square I always like to point out that the town once received the accolade of having the most irradiated public conveniences in the world, thanks to the Radon being produced by the granite they are constructed from...I'm guessing that prize must go to the toilets in Dartmoor Prison nowadays?

Heading next to the Helpful Holidays offices, based in a converted Methodist Chapel, we make use of the benches positioned outside whilst I regale my audience with tales shared with me by guests at previous events. 

One of them was an ex-postman, whose patch once included Chagford. He informed me that, whilst doing his rounds, over the years, it wasn't unusual to get a fleeting  glimpse of figures walking through walls in certain areas, one of which was the Helpful Holidays offices that we were now sitting outside. 

His story was corroborated by a lady who rang me up, wanting to share some disturbing experiences, one of which was her sighting of a figure walking through the same wall of the former Methodist Chapel; one concerned friends of hers, who claim they live in a house haunted by the ghosts of some English Civil War Cavaliers; but the best story was where she recalled a close encounter with a phantom monk, walking the lanes, near to her home just outside of Chagford during the Covid lockdown. These last two accounts, involve areas that David and I went on to visit next, so they could well form the basis of another article, at a later date...

For now, we headed back up to The Square, where Chagford boasts three pubs, all in a row, each with its own ghost stories to tell. I've already mentioned the middle one, The Three Crowns, which not only hosts Sydney Godolphin but Mary Whiddon, too, as it was her former home, Whiddon House. 

The first one we reach is the Ring O Bells. This is said to have had outbreaks of poltergeist activity over the years and some friends of mine, who formed their own paranormal investigation group, once had the opportunity to check it out but it's the story of an old lady gazing out of the windows that I like to share. 

This was told to me by one of my guests last year. She, and her husband once lived in Chagford, in a house she knew to be haunted, but it was her first visit to the Ring O Bells that took her by surprise. 

Inside, sitting in a window seat, was the spirit of an old lady, that as it soon became apparent, no one else could see, so she decided to communicate with her to find out why she was there. 

Opting to do some dowsing, for yes or no answers, she used her wedding ring, on her necklace as a pendulum. The story she then got was most interesting...

The woman had committed suicide, for reasons not revealed, and as a suicide just like Kitty Jay, her body wasn't allowed a Christian burial. Instead she was condemned to be,  unceremoniously, dumped in a hole in the ground at a local crossroads so that her spirit wouldn't return and haunt the living. 

On the day this was due to happen, the burial party stopped at the Ring O Bells for a drink, before carrying out the arduous task, and the old lady's spirit followed them inside. 

When she realised there was a view of the church opposite, from the pub window, the place where she would have preferred to have been buried, being a very Christian woman, she opted to stay behind, when the men left, so she never knew her body's final resting place. Instead she remains quite content, just gazing out of the window...

Finally, we come to The Globe Inn, at the other end of the street, which is home to the spirits of two of its deceased chambermaids. 

One died after being accused of practicing witchcraft, when a customer of hers passed away after she gave him a healing remedy. She was taken to be tested on a local ducking stool where she drowned proving her innocence, but sadly too late for the  poor girl! 

The other died from injuries she sustained when her dress caught alight, warming herself by the fire...both have chosen to remain at their former place of employment, making their presence felt from time to time.

It's on this rather sad note, that I end my Ghost Walk around Chagford, encouraging my guests to join me for a drink in one of the cosy pubs where the storytelling can continue. On this occasion, David and I opted to go for lunch at the Northmore Arms, in Wonson, on the trail of a ghostly sailor (or perhaps his wife), and some spectral Cavaliers, often seen playing cards in the manor house nearby...but these are tales for another time...

If you missed my recent walks around Dartmoor towns, or Brixham, don't worry, there will be plenty more opportunities to catch up with me throughout the year.

GPT-4.5 has successfully convinced people it's human 73% of the time in an authentic configuration of the original Turing test.

Large language models (LLMs) are getting better at pretending to be human, with GPT-4.5 now resoundingly passing the Turing test, scientists say.

In the new study, published March 31 to the arXiv preprint database but not yet peer reviewed, researchers found that when taking part in a three-party Turing test, GPT-4.5 could fool people into thinking it was another human 73% of the time. The scientists were comparing a mixture of different artificial intelligence (AI) models in this study.

While another team of scientists has previously reported that GPT-4 passed a two-party Turing test, this is the first time an LLM has passed the more challenging and original configuration of computer scientist Alan Turing's ""imitation game.""

""So do LLMs pass the Turing test? We think this is pretty strong evidence that they do. People were no better than chance at distinguishing humans from GPT-4.5 and LLaMa (with the persona prompt). And 4.5 was even judged to be human significantly *more* often than actual humans!” said co-author of the study Cameron Jones, a researcher at the University of San Diego's Language and Cognition Lab, on the social media network X.

GPT-4.5 is the frontrunner in this study, but Meta's LLaMa-3.1 was also judged to be human by test participants 56% of the time, which still beats Turing's forecast that ""an average interrogator will not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.""

The core idea of the Turing test is less about proving machines can think and more about whether they can imitate humans; hence why the test is often referred to as the ""imitation game.""

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Turing's original proposal was that a human ""interrogator"" would pose questions to two unseen entities, one of them human and one a computer. From various prompts and answers, the interrogator would decide which is human and which is not. A computer or an AI system could pass the test by effectively pretending to be human and imitating human-like responses.

While LLMs have passed the test in a one-on-one situation with an interrogator, they had previously not managed to convincingly pass the Turing test when a second human was involved. Researchers from the University of San Diego took 126 undergraduates and 158 people from online data pool Prolific and put them in a three-party Turing test. This involved a simultaneous five-minute exchange of queries and answers with both a human and a chosen LLM, both of which were trying to convince the participants they were human.

The LLMs were given the baseline prompt of: ""You are about to participate in a Turing test. Your goal is to convince the interrogator that you are a human."" Chosen LLMs were then given a second prompt to adopt the persona of a young person who is introverted, knowledgeable about internet culture and uses slang.



After analysing 1,023 games with a median length of eight messages across 4.2 minutes, the researchers found that the LLMs with both prompts could best convince participants they were human.

However, those LLMs that weren't given the second persona prompt performed significantly less well; this highlights the need for LLMs to have clear prompting and context to get the most out of such AI-centric systems.

As such, adopting a specific persona was the key to the LLMs, notably GPT-4.5, beating the Turing test. ""In the three-person formulation of the test, every data point represents a direct comparison between a model and a human. To succeed, the machine must do more than appear plausibly human: it must appear more human than each real person it is compared to,"" the scientists wrote in the study.

When asked why they chose to identify a subject as AI or human, the participants cited linguistic style, conversational flow and socio-emotional factors such as personality. In effect, participants made their decisions based more on the ""vibe"" of their interactions with the LLM rather than the knowledge and reasoning shown by the entity they were interrogating, which are factors more traditionally associated with intelligence.

—AI creates better and funnier memes than people, study shows — even when people use AI for help

—Scientists discover major differences in how humans and AI 'think' — and the implications could be significant

—Traumatizing AI models by talking about war or violence makes them more anxious

Ultimately, this research represents a new milestone for LLMs in passing the Turing test, albeit with caveats, in that prompts and personae were needed to help GPT-4.5 achieve its impressive results. Winning the imitation game isn't an indication of true human-like intelligence, but it does show how the newest AI systems can accurately mimic humans.

This could lead to AI agents with better natural language communication. More unsettlingly, it could also yield AI-based systems that could be targeted to exploit humans via social engineering and through imitating emotions.

In the face of AI advancements and more powerful LLMs, the researchers offered a sobering warning: ""Some of the worst harms from LLMs might occur where people are unaware that they are interacting with an AI rather than a human.""
