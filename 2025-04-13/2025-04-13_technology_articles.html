The tech industry may not be safe from new tariffs, according to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

The Trump administration announced Friday evening that consumer electronics such as laptops and smartphones would be exempt from the tariffs it unveiled earlier this month. (While Trump delayed many of those tariffs this week, he left a 10% baseline tariff in place, and also levied an additional 125% tariff on Chinese goods.)

Reports about the exemptions noted that tech products might still be affected by targeted tariffs to come, with semiconductors coming under particular scrutiny.

Lutnick made that more explicit on Sunday morning during an interview with the ABC show “This Week,” saying that Trump is making these products “exempt from the reciprocal tariffs” but including them in “the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.”

“All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,” Lutnick said. “We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels — we need to have these things made in America.”

Pressed on whether tariffs will mean higher prices for American consumers, Lutnick said, “I don't think so,” and again emphasized, “I think the idea is that we can manufacture in America.” (Others have said Lutnick's vision that “the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,” is a fantasy.)

Trump himself was asked about semiconductor tariffs this weekend, and he said, “I'll give you that answer Monday.”

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Palo Alto Online reports that folks pressing crosswalk wait buttons in Redwood City, Menlo Park, and Palo Alto areas heard messages featuring Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg sound-a-likes. It isn't just the voices that have been changed - instead of the possibly useful warnings about traffic, vocal caricatures of these famous tech leaders deliver messages laced with satire. A spokesperson for the City of Palo Alto indicated that the crosswalk button hacking was limited to 12 locations downtown, and probably occurred sometime on Friday. Meanwhile, officials from Redwood City and Menlo Park (the two other areas known to be affected by the hacking) confirmed they were aware of and were working on fixing these voice hacks. So, what were the satirical messages installed at crosswalks to ape Musk and Zuck? The Zuckerberg parody messages included one where he stated, “it's normal to feel uncomfortable or even violated as we forcefully insert AI into every facet of your conscious experience. And I just want to assure you, you don't need to worry because there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop it.” Other Zuckerberg flavored messages feature jokes about “undermining democracy” and delivering “AI slop.” An example of a Musk sound-a-like message shared by Palo Alto Online was: “You know, people keep saying cancer is bad, but have you tried being a cancer? We aren't surprised that neither Meta nor Tesla spokespersons wished to comment on the crosswalk hacks. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It has extended far beyond its roots as the steward of the Linux kernel, emerging as a sprawling umbrella outfit for a thousand open source projects spanning cloud infrastructure, security, digital wallets, enterprise search, fintech, maps, and more. With founding members such as IBM, Intel, and Oracle, the Foundation's raison d'être was challenging the “closed” platforms of that time — which basically meant doubling down on Linux in response to Windows' domination. “Computing is entering a world dominated by two platforms: Linux and Windows,” the Linux Foundation's executive director, Jim Zemlin (pictured above), said at the time. “While being managed under one roof has given Windows some consistency, Linux offers freedom of choice, customization and flexibility without forcing customers into vendor lock-in.” Zemlin has led the charge at the Linux Foundation for some two decades, overseeing its transition through technological waves such as mobile, cloud, and — more recently — artificial intelligence. Its evolution from Linux-centricity to covering just about every technological nook is reflective of how technology itself doesn't stand still — it evolves and, more importantly, it intersects. “Technology goes up and down — we're not using iPods or floppy disks anymore,” Zemlin explained to TechCrunch in an interview during KubeCon in London last week. Combining multiple critical projects under a single organization enables the Foundation to benefit from vertical-specific expertise in networking or automotive-grade Linux, for example, while tapping broader expertise in copyright, patents, data privacy, cybersecurity, marketing, and event organization. Being able to pool such resources across projects is more important than ever, as businesses contend with a growing array of regulations such as the EU AI Act and Cyber Resilience Act. “At the Linux Foundation, we have specialists who work in vertical industry efforts, but they're not lawyers or copyright experts or patent experts. We can create technology in an agile way through technical leadership at the project level, but then across all the projects have a set of tools that create long-term sustainability for all of them collectively.” OpenStack, for the uninitiated, is an open source, open standards-based cloud computing platform that emerged from a joint project between Rackspace and NASA in 2010. Zemlin had known Jonathan Bryce, OpenInfra Foundation CEO and one of the original OpenStack creators, for years. “We realized that together we could deal with some of the challenges that we're seeing now around regulatory compliance, cybersecurity risk, legal challenges around open source — because it [open source] has become so pervasive,” Zemlin said. The Linux Foundation Europe, which houses a handful of projects such as The Open Wallet Foundation, allows European members to collaborate with one another in isolation, while also gaining reciprocal membership for the broader Linux Foundation global outfit. “There are times where, in the name of digital sovereignty, people want to collaborate with other EU organizations, or a government wants to sponsor or endow a particular effort, and you need to have only EU organizations participate in that,” Zemlin said. “This [Linux Foundation Europe] allows us to thread the needle on two things — they can work locally and have digital sovereignty, but they're not throwing out the global participation that makes open source so good.” While AI is inarguably a major step-change both for the technology realm and society, it has also pushed the concept of “open source” into the mainstream arena in ways that traditional software hasn't — with controversy in hot pursuit. Meta, for instance, has positioned its Llama brand of AI models as open source, even though they decidedly are not by most estimations. It's basically a handy way to establish how “open” a model really is by assessing which components are public, and under what licenses. Just because a model isn't strictly “open source” by one definition doesn't mean that it isn't open enough to help develop safety tools that reduce hallucinations, for example — and Zemlin says it's important to address these distinctions. “I talk to a lot of people in the AI community, and it's a much broader set of technology practitioners [compared to traditional software engineering],” Zemlin said. “What they tell me is that they understand the importance of open source meaning ‘something' and the importance of open source as a definition. Where they get frustrated is being a little too pedantic at every layer. Chinese AI darling DeepSeek has also played a big part in the open source AI conversation, emerging with performant, efficient open source models that upended how the incumbent proprietary players such as OpenAI plan to release their own models in the future. But all this, according to Zemlin, is just another “moment” for open source. “I think it's good that people recognize just how valuable open source is in developing any modern technology,” he said. “But open source has these moments — Linux was a moment for open source, where the open source community could produce a better operating system for cloud computing and enterprise computing and telecommunications than the biggest proprietary software company in the world. While acquiring an existing project or foundation might be easier, starting a new project from scratch is arguably more important, as it's striving to fulfill a need that is at least partially unmet. “The art is trying to figure out where there's a new opportunity for open source to have a big impact on an industry.” A VC looks for product-market fit, and entrepreneurs they want to work with — all in the name of making money. Can we bring the right team of developers and leaders together to make it happen? Linux itself is such a positive idea, it's so emblematic of truly impactful and successful ‘open source.

Asus has finally unveiled the ROG Crosshair X870E Extreme motherboard, standing as their flagship offering for the AM5 platform. The motherboard was showcased by Tony Yu at an ROG event held in China yesterday, and is set to launch in late April, priced at 9,999 Chinese Yuan, or around $1,400. Positioned at the top of Asus' motherboard stack, the X870E Extreme offers a dual-Ethernet setup with two USB4 40 Gbps ports, support for Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi 7, three PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots, alongside two PCIe 5.0 x16 expansion slots, just to name a few. Under these designations exist several sub-brands like Apex, Hero, Formula, and Gene, followed by Extreme, which serves as Asus' most premium (and expensive) option for any given platform. Following a sneak peek two weeks back, the X870E Extreme is now officially available on Asus' website with comprehensive details, and there's a lot to unpack today. The power delivery is handled by a combination of 20 power stages at 110A, two additional 110A stages, and two 80A stages powered by dual 8-pin EPS connectors at the top. In terms of memory support, the X870E Extreme is equipped with four DIMM slots, supporting up to 256GB of memory, with overclocking speeds exceeding 9,000 MT/s on Ryzen 9000 series processors. The motherboard carries two full-sized PCIe 5.0 x16 expansion slots, with support for Q-Release Slim, presumably with the updated design. The right side offers a Q-LED, START, and FLEXKEY buttons with several right-angled connectors. Wireless connectivity is handled by Wi-Fi 7 (320 MHz) and Bluetooth 5.4, in tandem with a dual-Ethernet solution for wired networking, featuring a Realtek 5GbE port and a Marvell AQtion 10GbE port. On the back side, you get two USB4 (40 Gbps) ports, 10x USB 10 Gbps ports (eight Type-A + two Type-C), a BIOS Flashback, and a Clear CMOS button, just to name a few. According to Asus China, the X870E Extreme will hit shelves in late April, priced at 9,999 Chinese Yuan (~$1,400). We're guessing the pricing will extend to its global counterpart.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. I've been reviewing plant-based meal kits and vegan meal delivery services for the better part of this year, and I've learned that man (in this case, me) cannot live on reheated frozen foods alone. Enter Thistle: a gluten-free, single-serving vegan meal delivery service that focuses on fresh produce with varied cuisines using additive-free vegan ingredients. Thistle offers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, and you can customize how many of each meal you want to be delivered per week, with two delivery days available. (You can change, pause, or cancel your subscription any time.) Meals are single servings, so this meal plan is best for those eating alone. All of Thistle's standard meals are vegan, gluten- and additive-free, but there's an optional add-on for sustainable meats for certain dinners and lunches at an additional $3 per meal. Meals mostly follow the same formula: preprepared with no cooking required. Thistle's more hearty dinner choices, like the chimichurri pasta bowl, only needed to be sautéed in a pan for a few minutes, but were better the next day when all the flavors had set together. Thistle has a new, curated menu each week, but you can always make edits to suit your taste. Because I wanted to be a completely unbiased tester, I went with Thistle's premade menu, which was mostly a mix of gluten-free, fruit-focused breakfasts; inventive, fresh salads; and mostly preprepared bean- and pasta-forward veggie dinners. You can select your preferences during signup, but Thistle accommodates soy, tree nut, coconut, peanut, fish, shellfish, and pork allergies. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. As previously mentioned, Thistle is great for those with dietary restrictions—all meals already don't contain dairy, eggs, gluten, refined white sugars, artificial sweeteners, artificial preservatives, additives, or dyes. It's a “crunchy” choice, while still being tasty enough that the average health-oriented person—vegan or not—will most likely find something they like. That is, emphasis on average: My Hamburger Helper-eating Missouri born-and-bred uncle may not have the same raves about these meals as I do. Like most meal delivery kits and subscription services, especially those with special dietary requirements or anything slapped with a vegan label, the meal packages are pretty pricey. The meals in this kit are more than I ever spend on weekly groceries: breakfasts start at $13, with lunches and dinners at $16, but they go down in price as you order more meals. At the time of writing, Thistle is offering 40 percent off first orders, which made my order of three breakfasts, lunches, and dinners (with no snacks) go from $122 to $73, which is a pretty solid deal at around $8 per meal. The meals are delivered in a reusable, insulated bag with recyclable ice packs that you set out with each new delivery to reuse in future orders and cut down on waste. Each meal is already prepared in a simple plastic container, with nutrition facts and ingredients on the label. Many of the meals could be eaten chilled (as is) straight from the fridge, but if you opt to reheat, the directions were simply to heat “in a skillet for 2-3 minutes or until desired temperature.” In this regard, Thistle would be perfect for people who want to eat raw and plant-based but don't want to do any of the work. Breakfasts are more like snacks and are 250 to 400 calories, with at least 10 grams of plant-based protein and around 10 grams of fiber. All of the lunch and dinner meals were surprisingly filling for being so vegetable-focused. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. My favorite meals focused on multiple textures and various ingredients to make a truly dynamic salad-type dish. Roasted poblano peppers, sweet corn, cabbage, brown rice, and pinto beans worked well together with the mild spinach backdrop and a roasted jalapeno vegan ranch dressing that I could've drank straight from the ramekin. I still dream of the Lemongrass Shirataki Bowl, a cold noodle salad dish that hit all the right elements of savory-spice and varied texture. The chilled rice noodles came with a lightly spicy marinated mince of sautéed vegetables and pea protein crumbles. The crisp cucumber, spinach, ginger, lemongrass, and peanuts added a crunchy texture, but the yummy salty, slightly tangy housemade vegan “fish” sauce truly brought this all together. This sauce used dynamic ingredients like coconut aminos, date syrup, rice vinegar, lime juice, tahini, mushrooms, and seaweed to get that same great super-umami flavor of fish sauce but without the suffering. I'm not a breakfast person, so Thistle's small, fruit-forward choices were perfect for me. The Super Seed & Berry Muesli overnight oat dish had good texture variety, and its bright-blue coconut and vanilla spirulina “mylk” was a fun addition, although I wish it had a little more fruit to add a fresh element. A chimichurri sauce was the stand-out on an otherwise one-note pasta dish with beans, artichoke, spinach, and sun-dried tomatoes. A Latin-inspired black bean, spinach, rice, and plantain dish needed more acid or spice to liven it up. (Later that night though, I had Thistle's vegan take on cheesecake with a tahini tres leches mousse that was perhaps the best vegan dessert I've ever had, so all was—pretty much—forgiven.) Besides the high price point—except for right now with 40 percent off (seriously, if you've been curious about this meal kit, I'd recommend you try while it's heavily discounted)—I don't have many gripes with Thistle. It was a bummer because I had to last-minute grocery shop for the week ahead on a busy Sunday night, which I hadn't budgeted for—time- or moneywise. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. All of the meals come in plastic containers, which can be very tricky with recycling. If you opt for this service, I'd make sure to check your local guidelines for which plastics are accepted and recycled. Where I live, they are much more lax with plastic recycling requirements, so I rinsed all of my containers and said a prayer to Mother Gaia that they would be recycled and not end up in a landfill for the rest of time. Most of the jars with twist lids were solid enough that they could be washed and reused. I would miss the ritual of chopping, adding spices, and sautéeing. But I most likely will be supplementing my regular meals with some of these dynamic, hearty salads for a quick, healthy lunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The LaserPecker LP5 is a premium, portable machine that can engrave just about anything with dual 20W Diode and Fiber lasers, but it is seriously hampered by clunky software and a noticeable lack of interface. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. The LP5 has a few improvements over the LP4 we reviewed in 2023, but it also has a puzzling lack of its best features. The very informative touch screen – with a time display – is sadly missing. Also, there doesn't seem to be an off button, but it can be powered off by holding down the pause button for a few seconds. This isn't explained in the manual, and I only discovered it after prowling internet forums. Before figuring this out, I thought you had to unplug it. Maybe a timer isn't needed for etching wood when it only takes a minute or two, but the real showstopper is LaserPecker's ability to deeply etch a 3D bas-relief in stone or metal. The software provided by LaserPecker is missing material presets, which requires you to run your own tests. This was a major let down and not something I would expect with a premium laser dubbed “smart” on its website. Retailing at $3,299 and currently on sale for $2,899, the LaserPecker LP5 costs more than many larger lasers with similar features. While it's a powerful machine and fun to experiment with, sadly, it did not make our list of best laser cutters and engravers. The optional enclosure we tested costs $699 but is on sale currently for $559. Buttons (must be connected to PC or Mobile) The LaserPecker LP5 comes with everything you need to assemble the laser: a pair of laser safety glasses and a shield. You also get a few samples of wood, slate, leather, and metal for testing. However, I accidentally set it on fire due to lack of settings. We also requested the optional enclosure, which included a built-in camera. The fans needed to cool this beast down are pretty loud and always on. It comes with a pipe to vent the exhaust away – you can put it outside a window or door, but we ran it through an air filter from a different manufacturer. Metal dust is pretty thick, and we clogged up one filter during our testing. Unlike large flatbed machines, the LaserPecker is a Galvo laser. This is the same motion system seen in laser light shows. The nature of this motion restricts its burn area to a circle, so it can't reach into the far corners of its build plate. You get the best results from items placed dead center. The LaserPecker LP5 has PC software and mobile apps that you can download for free. The flat baseplate has holes for screw mounted material holders – these holes go completely through the plate and so it should not be used for cutting. A grill with a solid bottom is provided for cutting, which offers much needed airflow for cleaner edges. It can also be completely removed from the stand and used freehand if you're feeling particularly brave. You can purchase an optional enclosure, which allows you to use the machine around other people and your pets. There's also a “live preview” box that projects a blue rectangle that represents the artwork to help get everything in the right spot. I requested the enclosure to test for this machine to be extra safe as I don't want to lock myself in a room away from my family and pets while testing the laser. The enclosure is valuable for professionals who need to use a laser in public spaces like stores, studios, and craft fairs. A camera located inside the box helps frame your work. I assembled the LaserPecker LP5 in about 15 minutes – it was just a matter of installing a few screws and plugging in USB cords. The LaserPecker LP5 is a Class 4 laser that can damage your eyes and burn skin. It also produces smoke and fumes while engraving or cutting materials. You must take precautions to operate the machine safely. Use this and any other laser at your own risk. You can set the machine to turn off when the cover is removed, but this is not on by default. Another sensor detects high temperatures and can shut off the laser to avoid fires. A tilt detector will shut off the laser if it tilts during operation. Because of this gap, you must always wear safety glasses for extra protection. It also helps control smoke emitted from the materials that you're burning. Prevent pets and other people from observing the laser while in use. Since the laser is literally burning material, never allow it to operate unattended and have a fire extinguisher handy just in case. Some materials should not be burned with a laser due to their chemical makeup – they could melt, catch fire or produce toxic fumes. Dallas Maker Space has published a list of safe and hazardous materials to use with their laser. The list of no-nos includes plastics, fiberglass and certain foams. The laser lens can get dirty from smoke and fumes. You will need to wipe it clean – while unplugged – before each laser session. If it's allowed to become dirty, the laser will lose some of its capability. Design Space on either platform lacks good presets for materials, so you'll need to do a lot of testing. The program waffled between engravings that were too light and setting my materials on fire. The connection wasn't very stable for my phone, and I struggled to get it working. The app should be a miniature version of the PC software, and it seems to have a lot of features, but it wasn't very intuitive to use. The LaserPecker LP5 has a medium power, 20-watt diode laser that can cut through thin wood up to 15mm, and a 20-watt fiber laser that can slice thin metal sheets that are one millimeter thick. This machine's best use for wood is for light engraving, as the lack of air assist causes a lot of flame and char. I was able to sand off light brown char on some of the wood I engraved, which makes the finished pieces much nicer. On the samples below, I made a QR Code to the Tom's Hardware website using a tool in LaserPecker's Design Space. I tried using masking tape to protect the wood – which might work for simpler designs. Design Space lets you pick different resolution levels, from 1K to 8K. It also measures the speed with “depth”, but a 40% depth is not necessarily a 40% cut through your piece. This burn took a few minutes, and the software did not record the time nor give me an estimate. This is one of the 0.007 inch painted aluminum business cards I picked up from x-Tool. The machine made quick work of this clip art flower, but without presets, I had to make a few guesses on the settings. I used the fiber laser at 100% depth and 100% power, and it cut it out in less than a minute with one pass. 3D engraving metal coins is a real showstopper, but Design Studio doesn't tell you how long it will take. I had to try it a few times after I ran out of time and did not want to leave the laser unattended. The LaserPecker LP5 is a very fast and versatile Galvo laser that can engrave just about anything thanks to its dual Diode and Fiber lasers. The $2,899 retail price tag is a bit steep for what you're getting – a small, portable laser that still requires safety glasses and/or an additional enclosure to use. Design Space has plenty of creative tools and the ability to import photos or clip art to transform them into lasered art. Not having a timer or estimate anywhere is super annoying, especially since you're not supposed to let a laser work unattended. If you want a dual diode and IR laser that's truly safe and portable, check out the xTool F1, currently available for $1,399.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>xLight aims to deliver a powerful alternative LPP source for ASML EUV tools by 2028. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Legendary Intel CTO and CEO Pat Gelsinger is now serving as executive chairman at xLight, a startup developing a free electron laser (FEL) technology as a light source for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems. Using a particle accelerator to generate light for litho machines has been discussed previously, but xLight claims it can produce such a source by 2028 — while maintaining compatibility with existing tools. "As part of my new role at Playground Global, I have joined xLight as executive chairman of the board," Gelsinger wrote in a LinkedIn post. "I will be working closely with Nicholas Kelez and team to build the world's most powerful Free Electron Lasers (FEL) by leveraging particle accelerator technology." At present, only ASML can build EUV litho systems and these use an intricate way of producing light with a 13.5nm wavelength. There is more than one way to create a light with an extremely short wavelength to produce chips with an 8nm ~ 13.5nm resolution, however. While ASML has demonstrated EUV source powers above 500W in research settings, these higher power levels are not yet available in commercially deployed systems. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Gelsinger claims that xLight's technology cuts per-wafer costs by around 50% and lowers both capital and operating expenses by threefold, which is a major leap in manufacturing efficiency. Meanwhile, the claim that the new LPP source can lower capital expenses and operating costs by three times can potentially mean a substantial decrease of a FEL-based litho tool cost compared to today's machines from ASML. Speaking of ASML, it is important to note that xLight does not aim to replace ASML's EUV litho tools, but produce an LPP source that "will be connected to an ASML scanner and running wafers by 2028." This may mean that xLight's LPP source will be compatible with existing ASML tools, but it is unclear whether it will be compatible with next-generation High-NA EUV tools (most probably yes, as they use the same LPP sources as existing Low-NA EUV tools). Remember that fabs are built to accommodate specific tools and in case of Low-NA EUV systems it means that the light source is located below the machine itself, whereas in case of High-NA EUV tool its LPP source is located on the same level, so any 'third party' LPP source has to take these facts into account. It is noteworthy that while xLight believes that its FEL technology represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity in the long term, it also opens near-term revenue in other key areas. The company believes that its systems are well-suited for high-power metrology and inspection tools. Anton Shilov is a contributing writer at Tom's Hardware.

On Saturday, the Trump administration rolled out a big exception to its across-the-board tariffs on electronics, such as computers and smartphones. The move spares Apple from major price hikes on a wide majority of its products and is a little relief for consumers and tech companies. In response, Amazon saw its chance to lower prices on the newly released 11th-generation iPad, which was released just a month ago in March. At $328 down from $349 for the 128GB Wi-Fi model, this is the best deals you'll find on Apple's latest tablet (it costs almost the same as the previous iPad 10 which is available for $319) which makes it a must-buy if you're looking for premium tech at a reasonable price point. The 11th-generation iPad is a major leap for Apple's tablet line. From photo editing, video streaming, or multiple apps open simultaneously, the A16 chip provides unparalleled speed and efficiency. The 11-inch Liquid Retina display of the iPad is another highlight, and this is why people also love Apple tactile tablets. With colors that pop and razor-sharp definition, it's ideal for watching movies, surfing the web or editing creative work. Storage is not an issue with this discounted model either as it has 128GB of internal storage (256GB and 512GB models are not on sale) and provides more than enough space for apps, photos, videos, and documents. For most users, the capacity of this much is well balanced between cost and usability. Additionally, the iPad is Wi-Fi 6 compatible for faster and more reliable internet access. Apple is guaranteeing as much as 10 hours of use on a single charge, which is ideal for long days at the office or on the road. It also supports accessories such as the Apple Pencil (2nd generation) and Magic Keyboard, turning it into an effective note-taking or productivity tool. The savings do not appear significant in contrast with the discounts applicable to earlier models or refurbished products, but this is a very new product being offered at this price level so shortly after release. Amazon's bold pricing approach ensures that this is an unbeatable deal, despite the tariffs hike. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. Specifically, I like thinking about how to cook chicken well. I can trace a line from my Mom's famous sour cream chicken with chives and paprika, to Cook's Illustrated's “easy roast chicken” in its original The Best Recipe, and on to Simon Hopkinson's Roast Chicken and Other Stories, with hundreds of other stops along the way. At home, I love roasting a whole chicken, an art form where, if you do it right, you're rewarded with a dark, crispy skin, delicious leg quarters, and tender breast meat. Breasts need to hit an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, but legs and thighs are better when cooked to a higher temperature. It's not like you're cooking a perfectly round, fairly-homogenous, inch-thick hamburger, either. Chickens are … you know … chicken shaped, with different thicknesses, densities, and parts that poke out. Roast a chicken breast and it will cook pretty quickly and be ready to pull out of the oven a bit under 165°F, which will allow it to coast to a finish without overcooking, something known as “carryover cooking.” Thighs, on the other hand, are much more forgiving and become fall-off-the-bone tender with a longer cooking time and if they're cooked to a higher internal temperature, which turns cooking the whole thing into a puzzle. Way back in 1999, Cook's Illustrated cooked 14 chickens at different temperatures (or temperature combinations) for that “easy roast chicken” recipe and came up with a pan-roasting method that starts at 375 degrees and finishes at 450. As a budding technique nerd, I was entranced. Today, it's surprisingly hard to find a serious cookbook that cooks a whole bird in what you might call the traditional method. Chef-author Hugh Acheson is a proponent of coating the bird with baking powder for deep and even browning. Taking extra steps like these might sound fussy, but it can also be a lot of fun. If you're following a tested recipe, dinner will likely turn out great. If that tinkering vibe is your jam, I have a new unique new tool for you to play with, a stout metal rod called the PoulTree with a series of bends along its length allow you to attach it to the handle of a Lodge cast-iron skillet. (Side note: While the PoulTree is a solid, well thought-out item, website photos are almost universally, comically bad. I bought a nice chicken, sprinkled it with salt inside and out, aka a “dry brine,” and let it air dry overnight in the fridge. The PoulTree team suggests cooking on a hot grill, so I started there, or at least as close as I could. One particularly fun part about this thing is that's pretty much all you need to do until it's done. I could not resist peeking once or twice, when I watched the drippings and Seattle raindrops vaporize on the pan surface. Per the manufacturer's personal suggestion, I pulled it when the breast hit 148 degrees, put but it on a cutting board and let it coast right to 165 degrees, at which point the drumstick got up to 188 degrees. I carved it and got out my notebook. I wondered how I might change things the next round, and I kind of marveled at the simplicity of the thing and how it cooked with do-it-on-a-weeknight speed. I also realized a safety item to keep in mind. You can't really remove the bird from the rod when it's over the grill, and you don't want to walk far at all holding a heavy and still screaming-hot skillet with a chicken attached to it either. I thought about what could've happened if it started burning my hand while I was walking down the stairs from my deck to my kitchen with nowhere to set it down. side table, then walked that down to the kitchen and set it on top of my stove. On this cooler, wetter day, the grill simply didn't get as hot, meaning that pulling it at 148 degrees didn't carry over as much as I wanted it to by the end of the resting period. Not a big deal, an easy-to-fix user error, and being a decently cooked chicken slathered with za'atar, it was still great. The $19 PoulTree offers a $60 "roaster" option, where you buy it with a Lodge pan with the idea that that's all you use the pan for, and considering how scuzzy the pans get during cooking, it's a pretty good idea. A third bird, this one with no overnight brining or air-drying, simply coated in amba (see the cookbook Zahav Home for more on that goodness) and put on the grill was an unqualified weeknight success. Not a brined and marinated wonder, but still very good. I was in Oaxaca City for the next round, where I bought a chicken from Pollos José (no relation) in the Merced market. If you cook the chicken over an empty pan—PoulTree's preferred method—in too hot an oven, it can really turn into a smoke show, so you've got some thinking to do. My chef-pal and regular review helper Hamid Salimian got the willies thinking about cooking it in a hot oven, suggesting brining, then air-drying it before cooking it in a (not-too-hot) 350-degree oven with some veggies underneath. He also suggested marinating it with chilies for caramelization and flavor and trying to cook it breast side up. Chef Chris Young of Modernist Cuisine and Combustion—a better wireless thermometer than the RFX, IMO—fame also weighed in. For both chefs, I got the sense that they might be enjoying thinking about this new way to cook a classic, how they might approach it, and what the final outcome would be. At the very least, I was having fun.) This might've been my favorite thing about the PoulTree. If you're into chicken and general kitchen nerdery, trying it out is a fun and inexpensive way to tinker. You can make a speedy weeknight chicken with satisfying results, or be rewarded for putting a little extra care into it. “This will make things a bit steamier in the oven than a bare pan, but at least the smoke alarm won't be going off,” Young says. “Personally, I think you want something like potatoes, that benefit from the drippings … For me, nothing beats potatoes soaking up the drippings from a levitating bird.” The Big Story: Inside Elon Musk's ‘digital coup' ‘Airport theory' will make you miss your flight Exclusive: Up To 50% Off 6 Boxes With Factor Promo Code WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, the email was also addressed to at least one US citizen, an immigration attorney from Massachusetts. And it remains unclear who must abide by the email's instructions—or why the apparent revocation of legal immigration status was delivered via email at all. The email informs the recipient that “DHS is now exercising its discretion to terminate your parole,” which it says will go into effect “7 days from the date of this notice.” The email appears to be similar, if not identical, to messages received by users of CBP One, an app developed during the Biden administration that allows non-citizens from certain countries to schedule appointments at US points of entry in an effort to seek asylum. A spokesperson for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tells WIRED, however, that the email was sent more broadly. “CBP has issued notices terminating parole for individuals who do not have lawful status to remain,” says CBP assistant commissioner for public affairs Hilton Beckham. Former President Joe Biden began OAW, or Operation Allies Welcome, in 2021 following the US military's exit from Afghanistan to allow for the safe resettling of “vulnerable Afghans, including those who worked alongside us in Afghanistan for the past two decades,” according to DHS. The email itself does not identify these or any other exemptions, nor does it make clear to whom it applies beyond the recipient. “Some personal news: the Department of Homeland Security has given me, an immigration lawyer born in Newton, Massachusetts, seven days to leave the US,” wrote Nicole Micheroni, a partner at  Cameron Micheroni & Silvia LLC, in a post on Bluesky on Friday night. “Does anyone know if you can get Italian citizenship through great-grandparents?” Micheroni tells WIRED that she first thought the email was intended for one of her clients, but she quickly noticed that it was only addressed to her. “I don't feel like I'm actually going to be deported in seven days, but it's concerning that this is the level of care they're using to send these out,” Micheroni says. While it moved to subject them to expedited deportation effective April 24, on Thursday a federal judge in Boston said she would issue a protective order blocking that attempt. “So many people don't have a lawyer, or their lawyer has 6,000 clients,” Regan says, which “completely overloads” the attorneys who often provide pro bono legal services to immigrants. “A lot of people that are here on parole status don't know the nuances of immigration law, so they get this email and they don't know if it applies to them,” Micheroni says. “And most of them assume that it does because everything is really scary for people right now.” It's also unclear whether the email is related to recent efforts by Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In an April 10 post on X, DOGE claimed that “CBP identified a subset of 6.3k individuals paroled into the United States since 2023 on the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center watchlist or with criminal records. Beckham did not immediately respond to questions about whether the email was intended for these 6,300 individuals, nor did she answer WIRED's questions about how many people received the email. Then there's the matter of the email being an email at all, Regan says, adding that “it is absolutely not common” for a change in legal immigration status to arrive via email, which typically happens in person or via certified mail. “People would think it's a phishing email or something not legitimate,” Regan says. Also, the fact that the email does not appear to have been first posted on a government website added to questions about its authenticity. “Normally if the government is going to change a practice, they would first do it on their websites,” Regan says, adding, “but the fact that this was not on the website first and then sent out as a direct communication is very, very unusual.” “And if people in my life are feeling this way, and this is what I do, I know a lot about it,” Micheroni adds.</p>
