                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have developed an innovative new nanopore sequencing assay to identify carriers of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading cause of monogenic autism spectrum disorder and inherited intellectual disabilities. The study in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, published by Elsevier, addresses the urgent need for a screening tool to identify carriers of FXS in a more comprehensive, faster, efficient, and cost-effective way compared to current methods, for better informed genetic counseling. Lead investigator Qiwei Guo, PhD, Department of Central Laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fujian Key Clinical Specialty of Laboratory Medicine, Women and Children's Hospital, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, says, "Although FXS carrier prevalence is high, with all major ethnic groups and races being susceptible to FXS, widespread FXS carrier screening for the general population has remained debatable. However, an accurate, fast, affordable, and effective carrier screening assay that can examine a large number of female samples was still lacking. In this study, we developed a reliable and user-friendly software to analyze sequencing data and report results." The gene responsible for FXS is fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein1 (FMR1), an X-linked dominant gene with full penetrance in all males and many females. It plays a crucial role in synapse formation and normal dendrite development. Co-investigator Yulin Zhou, PhD, Department of Central Laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fujian Key Clinical Specialty of Laboratory Medicine, Women and Children's Hospital, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, explains, "We demonstrated that the nanopore sequencing assay can accurately identify the full range of premutation FMR1 alleles, which account for the majority of FXS carriers, and the nanopore sequencing assay was able to reliably quantify CGG repeats and AGG interruptions, two specific DNA sequence variations that are critical for determining the risk of full mutation expansion in carriers, thus facilitating genetic counseling for carrier screening." By utilizing identifier sequences, the researchers were able to test multiple samples in a single assay, dramatically increasing test capacity and reducing costs. The nanopore sequencing assay can be accomplished within a short turnaround time (approximately two days for an assay testing 100 simultaneously) by a technician in a standard molecular diagnostics laboratory. Compared to other commonly used techniques, the equipment for nanopore sequencing assays is more accessible and portable, and thus could be more readily and widely adapted, particularly in underdeveloped regions of the world. Dr. Guo concludes, "We focus on controlling human genetic diseases and reducing birth defects. Given the significant morbidity associated with FXS and the lack of effective treatments, prenatal diagnosis and intervention are warranted. Our findings demonstrate that this novel nanopore sequencing assay overcomes key limitations of existing methods for FXS carrier screening, ultimately paving the way for enhanced genetic counseling and broader implementation worldwide."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cuts to Medicaid and other federal health programs proposed in President Donald Trump's budget plan would rapidly push more than 300 financially struggling rural hospitals toward a fiscal cliff, according to researchers who track the facilities' finances. The hospitals would be at a disproportionate risk of closure, service reductions, or ending inpatient care, according to a report authored by experts from the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research following a request from Senate Democrats, who released the findings publicly Thursday. Many of those hospitals are in Kentucky, Louisiana, California, and Oklahoma, according to the analysis. Trump's budget plan, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” contains nearly $700 billion in Medicaid cuts, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. House Republicans passed the bill in late May, and it now awaits Senate consideration. The proposed cuts to Medicaid raise the stakes for rural hospitals nationwide, many of which already operate on razor-thin, if not negative, margins. Diminished reimbursements from the state-federal health insurance program for those with low incomes or disabilities would further erode hospitals' ability to stay open and maintain services for their communities — populations with more severe health needs than their urban counterparts. "It's very clear that Medicaid cuts will result in rural hospital closures," said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit advocacy and research organization. The Senate Democrats sent a letter to Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and House Speaker Mike Johnson asking them to reconsider the Medicaid cuts. "No life or job is worth a yes vote on this big billionaire bill." Hospitals that do stay afloat likely will do so by cutting services that are particularly dependent on Medicaid reimbursements, such as labor and delivery units, mental health care, and emergency rooms. Obstetric services are among the most expensive and are being eliminated by a growing number of rural hospitals, expanding the areas that lack nearby maternity or labor and delivery care. That vulnerability stems at least partly from rural Americans' being more likely to depend on Medicaid than the general population. But Medicaid covers only about half of what private insurance reimburses for childbirth-related services. Rural health systems have been struggling to meet the needs of their communities without the cuts to Medicaid, which brings in $12.2 billion, or nearly 10% of rural hospital net revenue, according to a Chartis report from May. Hospitals in rural areas would collectively lose more than $1.8 billion with a 15% cut to Medicaid. That loss in revenue is roughly equivalent to 21,000 full-time hospital employees' salaries. Ten years ago, about one-third of rural hospitals were operating in the red. Facilities will lose $509 million this year due to a 2% Medicare reimbursement cut — what's known as sequestration — and $159 million in reimbursement for bad debt and charity care combined. Some rural hospitals have responded to the increasing financial pressures in recent years by joining larger networks, such as Intermountain Health or Sanford, which are connected to facilities in the Mountain West and Midwest. But about half of rural hospitals are still independent, Topchik said, and struggle with a perennial collision of low patient volume and high fixed costs. "We can't Henry Ford our way out of this by increasing volumes to dilute costs and reduce prices," he said. "It's expensive, and that's the reason the federal government, for a long time, has reimbursed rural hospitals in a variety of manners to help keep them whole." They provide health care to Americans who are older, sicker, and poorer and have less access overall to providers compared with people who live in urban areas. In many cases, a local rural hospital is the largest employer in a community and can trigger substantial local economic declines if it closes. "When you close a hospital, oftentimes, the community follows," Morgan said. Kentucky, Texas, New York, North Carolina, California, and Michigan have the largest estimated populations of rural Medicaid enrollees. And while Utah is not a state identified as especially vulnerable, health leaders there are concerned about rural hospital closures if Medicaid funding is cut, said Matt McCullough, the rural hospital improvement director for the Utah Hospital Association. Facilities in rural parts of Utah are often governed by a board made up of community members — farmers, ranchers, and business owners who care about keeping their hospitals open, McCullough said, because they were born there and their kids were born there.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CRISPR-Cas13, a powerful RNA-targeting technology is gaining increasing attention as a next-generation gene therapy platform due to its precision and reduced side effects. Utilizing this system, researchers at KAIST have now developed the world's first technology capable of selectively acetylating (chemically modifying) specific RNA molecules among countless transcripts within living cells. This breakthrough enables precise, programmable control of RNA function and is expected to open new avenues in RNA-based therapeutic development. KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced that a research team led by Professor Won Do Heo in the Department of Biological Sciences has recently developed a groundbreaking technology capable of selectively acetylating specific RNA molecules within the human body using the CRISPR-Cas13 system—an RNA-targeting platform gaining increasing attention in the fields of gene regulation and RNA-based therapeutics. RNA molecules can undergo chemical modifications—the addition of specific chemical groups—which alter their function and behavior without changing the underlying nucleotide sequence. Among them, N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) has been particularly enigmatic, with ongoing debate about its existence and function in human messenger RNA (mRNA), the RNA that encodes proteins. To address this gap, the KAIST research team developed a targeted RNA acetylation system, named dCas13-eNAT10. This platform combines a catalytically inactive Cas13 enzyme (dCas13) that guides the system to specific RNA targets, with a hyperactive variant of the NAT10 enzyme (eNAT10), which performs RNA acetylation. To validate its therapeutic potential, the team successfully delivered the targeted RNA acetylation system into the livers of live mice using adeno-associated virus (AAV), a commonly used gene therapy vector. This marks the first demonstration of in vivo RNA modification, extending the applicability of RNA chemical modification tools from cell culture models to living organisms. Professor Won Do Heo, who previously developed COVID-19 treatment technology using RNA gene scissors and technology to activate RNA gene scissors with light, stated, "Existing RNA chemical modification research faced difficulties in controlling specificity, temporality, and spatiality. However, this new technology allows selective acetylation of desired RNA, opening the door for accurate and detailed research into the functions of RNA acetylation." He added, "The RNA chemical modification technology developed in this study can be widely used as an RNA-based therapeutic agent and a tool for regulating RNA functions in living organisms in the future."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hyponatremia, or low blood sodium concentration, is typically viewed as a symptomless condition-until recently. Their findings, published online in the journal Molecular Neurobiology on May 14, 2025, reveal that CHN alters monoaminergic signaling in the amygdala, a brain region critical for processing fear and emotion. "While CHN has been associated with cognitive impairments, our study is among the first to provide evidence that it also leads to innate anxiety-like behaviors through changes in brain chemistry," explains Dr. Fujisawa. Hyponatremia is usually caused by conditions like liver cirrhosis, heart failure, or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). In chronic cases, the brain adapts to the low-sodium environment by adjusting its cellular content through a compensatory mechanism known as volume regulatory decrease (VRD). But this adaptation, while protective, comes at a physiological cost. This compensation process involves the loss of organic osmolytes and neurotransmitter precursors that help stabilize brain cell volume under low-sodium conditions. Over time, this may lead to disruption in the production, release, or recycling of key mood-regulating chemicals. They found that the mice exhibited significantly lower serum sodium levels, which were maintained over a prolonged period, consistent with chronic hyponatremia (CHN) and exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviors in both the light/dark transition and open field tests-standard behavioral assays in neuroscience. Further biochemical analyzes revealed that levels of serotonin and dopamine, two key neurotransmitters that regulate mood, were significantly reduced in the amygdala of mice with CHN. These changes were accompanied by a drop in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation-a molecular signal for emotional regulation. "Our data suggest that CHN disrupts the balance of monoamines in the amygdala, especially serotonin and dopamine, which in turn modulates innate anxiety," says Prof. Sugimura. To test whether these effects were reversible, the researchers corrected the mice's sodium levels by stopping desmopressin infusion and reverting them to a solid diet. Serotonin, dopamine, and ERK phosphorylation levels in the amygdala also returned to normal. "This shows not only that CHN causes anxiety-like symptoms but also that these symptoms can be alleviated with proper correction of sodium imbalance," says Dr. Fujisawa. CHN is fairly common among elderly patients and those with chronic illnesses. Identifying and treating its neurological manifestations can improve their quality of life. "Our findings add to the growing evidence that chronic hyponatremia is not just a metabolic abnormality, but a condition with real neurological and psychological consequences," Prof. Sugimura concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pancreatic cancer is a severe illness and major challenge in cancer medicine since it is difficult to diagnose, while potential therapies are scarce. A new international cooperation study indicates that in the future pancreatic cancer may be detected at an early stage from gut microbes. Gut microbes may also offer solutions for therapy development. Researchers from HUS, the University of Helsinki, the University of Jyväskylä, Finland, and from Iran have jointly made new observations about gut microbes associated with pancreatic cancer. The researchers analyzed microbes living in the guts of Finnish and Iranian pancreatic cancer patients and their healthy peers. The same gut microbes associated with pancreatic cancer were found in the patients irrespective of geographic location and ethnic background. Pancreatic cancer patients' intestinal flora included significantly more facultative pathogens and significantly less beneficial bacteria than in the healthy peer group. In particular, beneficial bacteria belonging to the class of Clostridia, such as butyric acid-producing Lachnospiraceae, Butyricicoccaceae and Ruminococcaceae, had decreased. Pancreatic cancer pathogens include, for example, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae and Fusobacteriaceae. The levels of these in pancreatic cancer patients' intestinal flora were high. "The findings on beneficial Clostridia are interesting because it has been shown earlier that ordinary Clostridiales populations effectively mediate anti-canceric immune reactions against solid tumors." The researchers accordingly point out that future research projects should investigate whether these could serve as a new generation of probiotics, that is, living microbic products, which could be combined with traditional chemotherapy medicines. The researchers also developed a statistical model based on the microbiome, by means of which it could be possible to predict pancreatic cancer. It is a good first step to enable early recognition of pancreatic cancer in the future. Sammallahti, H., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A rich and varied mix of microbes in the mouth, particularly bacteria, is not only important for our oral health, but may hold clues for other conditions. A new study led by researchers at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing finds that a lower diversity of microbes in the mouth is associated with depression. The mouth is home to between 500 billion and 1 trillion bacteria-the second-largest community of microorganisms in our bodies, after the gut. Using data from more than 15,000 US adults ages 18 and older collected between 2009 and 2012, the researchers compared questionnaires measuring symptoms of depression with saliva samples. The researchers found that people with less diversity in their oral microbiomes were more likely to have symptoms of depression. These findings suggest that, with more research, the oral microbiome could potentially be used to diagnose or treat depression. However, based on this study, it's not clear whether the diversity of microbes in the mouth influences depression or if depression leads to changes in the oral microbiome-or if there's a bidirectional relationship between the two. It's possible that the oral microbiome influences depressive symptoms through inflammation or changes to the immune system. Conversely, depression can drive changes including dietary intake, poor oral hygiene, increased smoking and drinking, or the use of medications-all of which have the potential to alter the oral microbiome. We need more research to understand the direction and underlying pathways of this relationship." Bei Wu, vice dean for research at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing "This work is part of a broader effort to understand how the oral microbiome influences not only mental health, but also cognitive decline and the onset of dementia," she added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leg amputation rates caused by arterial disease are four times as high in the most disadvantaged areas in England. Whilst socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a higher risk of amputation, this new study highlights the worrying scale of the disparities. Peripheral arterial disease is a debilitating condition caused by a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries to the legs which restricts blood supply. Major amputation of the lower limb is a last resort when other treatment options do not exist or have failed. The main reasons for amputation include severe infection of the leg and gangrene caused by restricted arterial blood supply. The new study, funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), examined associations between socioeconomic deprivation and ethnicity and major leg amputation in England. The researchers analysed hospital admissions and census area data over a 12-year period from 2006 to 2018. During the study period there were a total of 47,249 major lower limb amputations due to peripheral arterial disease. Above knee amputation was around four times as high in the most disadvantaged compared with the least disadvantaged areas, while below knee amputation was around three times as high. Being told you need to have a leg amputated can be a devastating and frightening experience for patients. Greater efforts are needed in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas in order to prevent and manage peripheral arterial disease, reduce amputation rates and improve survival following amputation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using advanced single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and a widely used preclinical model for Alzheimer's disease, researchers from Mass General Brigham and collaborators at SUNY Upstate Medical University have identified specific brain cell types that responded most to exercise. These findings, which were validated in samples from people, shed light on the connection between exercise and brain health and point to future drug targets. "While we've long known that exercise helps protect the brain, we didn't fully understand which cells were responsible or how it worked at a molecular level," said senior author Christiane D. Wrann, DVM, PhD, a neuroscientist and leader of the Program in Neuroprotection in Exercise at the Mass General Brigham Heart and Vascular Institute and the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital. "Now, we have a detailed map of how exercise impacts each major cell type in the memory center of the brain in Alzheimer's disease." The study focused on a part of the hippocampus-a critical region for memory and learning that is damaged early in Alzheimer's disease. The research team leveraged single-nuclei RNA sequencing, a relatively new technologies that allow researchers to look at activity at the molecular level in single cells for an in-depth understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's. They then analyzed gene activity across thousands of individual brain cells, finding that exercise changed activity both in microglia, a disease-associated population of brain cells, and in a specific type of neurovascular-associated astrocyte (NVA), newly discovered by the team, which are cells associated with blood vessels in the brain. "That we were able to modulate newborn neurons using our new target genes set underscores the promise our study," said lead author Joana Da Rocha, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow working in Dr. Wrann's lab. To ensure the findings were relevant to humans, the team validated their discoveries in a large dataset of human Alzheimer's brain tissue, finding striking similarities. This work not only sheds light on how exercise benefits the brain but also uncovers potential cell-specific targets for future Alzheimer's therapies. Our study offers a valuable resource for the scientific community investigating Alzheimer's prevention and treatment."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>My name is Oksana Sirenko, and I am a Senior Scientist at Molecular Devices. Our company specializes in developing instruments and reagents for biological research. Our mission is to empower scientists by providing tools that support innovative scientific discoveries and ultimately enhance the quality of life. In my role, I focus on high-content imaging, automation, and advanced cell-based assays, with a particular emphasis on 3D biology and drug discovery applications. This is largely due to the limitations of 2D cell cultures and animal models, which often do not accurately replicate the complexity of human tissues. They provide better biological relevance by replicating the structural complexity, organization, and functionality of human tissues. Their higher predictive accuracy bridges the gap between simple cell-based assays and whole-organ systems, making them more valuable for drug discovery. Organoids are also more cost-effective than animal models, offering faster and higher-throughput screening. Additionally, patient-derived organoids enable personalized medicine by allowing scientists to test drug responses on models derived from individual patients. Despite their potential, organoids face several barriers to broader adoption. Technical complexity is another hurdle, as processes like seeding, feeding, passaging, and monitoring demand high precision. Reproducibility remains a challenge, with difficulty in standardizing organoid formation across multiple wells or plates. However, advances in automation, high-content imaging, and machine learning-based analysis are helping to overcome these challenges. Automation plays a crucial role in overcoming the challenges associated with organoid research by simplifying workflows and improving reproducibility, scalability, and overall efficiency. New technologies now enable automated cell seeding, feeding, and passaging, which reduce the need for manual labor. Automated media exchange maintains consistency while preserving organoid integrity. High-throughput imaging and real-time analysis provide valuable insights into organoid development. Additionally, machine learning-driven decision-making allows software to guide experimental timing based on image analysis. These capabilities are making 3D biology more accessible for large-scale research and drug discovery. The CellXpress.ai system is an automated platform designed to streamline and scale organoid workflows. This comprehensive setup enables full automation of complex processes such as cell seeding, feeding, passaging, imaging, and data analysis. This level of automation enhances reproducibility, improves efficiency, and enables researchers to run multiple protocols simultaneously, making it a powerful solution for high-throughput drug discovery. Techniques like confocal imaging allow researchers to penetrate organoid structures and visualize internal features. This enables the generation of 3D image stacks for volumetric analysis and allows for characterization of organoid shape, size, and density over time. Researchers can also analyze individual cell populations within an organoid to monitor viability, proliferation, and phenotypic changes. Functional assays allow researchers to observe physiological responses in real time, offering insights that go beyond structural or viability assessments. Calcium flux analysis is especially valuable in specific organoid models. In neurospheroid assays, calcium flux can detect neuronal oscillations, offering insights into the effects of neuroactive drugs. Additionally, irregular calcium signaling can serve as an early indicator of cytotoxicity. These kinetic measurements provide a more comprehensive view of drug effects than static endpoint imaging. Automated organoid workflows have significantly advanced research in several key areas. In the area of cardiotoxicity screening, high-throughput assays using cardiac organoids are improving the evaluation of drug safety for conditions like heart failure and arrhythmia. Liver organoids are also gaining traction as alternative models for pharmaceutical toxicology, reducing reliance on animal testing. Automation enables the scalability of these applications, accelerating discoveries while reducing cost and variability. The future of 3D biology lies in the integration of fully automated, AI-powered platforms that combine automated culture and screening workflows with advanced imaging and machine learning-based analysis. These systems will also incorporate functional assays to provide deeper insights into cellular behavior. Personalized medicine will benefit significantly as patient-derived organoids become a routine part of drug testing. By moving away from outdated 2D and animal models toward human-relevant, high-throughput systems, we can accelerate the pace of drug discovery, improve translational success, and ultimately deliver better outcomes for patients. Over 160,000 of our innovative solutions are incorporated into laboratories worldwide, enabling scientists to improve productivity and effectiveness – ultimately accelerating research and the development of new therapeutics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taking the progestogen-only contraceptive pill desogestrel continuously for more than five years is associated with a small increased risk of developing a type of brain tumor called an intracranial meningioma, finds a study from France published by The BMJ today. However, the researchers stress that the risk is low compared with some other progestogens (for every 67,000 women taking desogestrel, one might need surgery for meningioma) and disappeared one year after stopping treatment. Intracranial meningiomas are typically non-cancerous brain tumors that occasionally require surgery. They are more common in older women, but many studies lack information on the specific type of progestogen used, and risk has not been measured for continuous, current, and long term use. To address this knowledge gap, researchers set out to assess the real-life risk of intracranial meningioma associated with short-term (less than 1 year) and prolonged (1-7 or more years) use of oral contraceptives containing desogestrel 75µg, levonorgestrel 30µg, or levonorgestrel 50-150 µg combined with estrogen. Their findings are based on data from the French national health data system (SNDS) for 8,391 women (average age 60; 75% older than 45) who had undergone surgery for intracranial meningioma in 2020-2023. The results show a small increased risk associated with use of desogestrel for more than five continuous years. An increased risk was not found for shorter durations or when desogestrel had been discontinued for more than one year, but it was if other progestogens of known associated increased risk of meningioma had been used in the six years before desogestrel. This excess risk was greater in women older than 45 years, those with a meningioma located in the front or middle of the skull, and after prolonged use of one of the known high risk progestogens before desogestrel. This is an observational study so can't establish cause and effect, and the authors acknowledge that some information may be missing from the SNDS database. Nor were they able to account for genetic predisposition and exposure to high dose radiation - factors that may have affected the results. However, by using comprehensive, real-life data, including history of using other known high risk progestogens, they were able to improve reliability and minimise bias. As such, they suggest that desogestrel should be discontinued if an intracranial meningioma is identified and patients monitored rather than undergoing immediate surgery. Although direct evidence is still lacking, stopping treatment when desogestrel related meningioma is diagnosed may preclude the need for surgery, says neurosurgeon Gilles Reuter in a linked editorial. "It is already common knowledge that stopping cyproterone, nomegestrol, chlormadinone, promegestone, medroxyprogesterone, or medrogestone precludes the need for surgery," he explains. "Now we know that stopping desogestrel may also avoid unnecessary potentially harmful treatments."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new method improving the accuracy of interpreting blood pressure measurements taken at the ankle could be crucial for people who cannot have their arm blood pressure measured. New research from the University of Exeter Medical School, published in BMJ Open and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), analysed data from over 33,000 people to create a personalized predictive model for more accurately estimating arm blood pressure from ankle readings - when compared to previously available methods. The team has developed an online calculator for healthcare professionals and patients to interpret these readings effectively. High blood pressure affects over one billion people globally, increasing the risk of serious health issues like heart, brain, and kidney diseases. While blood pressure is typically measured on the arm, sometimes this is not possible due to disability, missing limbs, or problems caused by conditions such as stroke. Blood pressure can be measured at the ankle instead, but these readings are generally higher than arm values. Standard guidelines for treating blood pressure are based on arm readings only, which creates complications in making accurate estimations based on ankle measurements, potentially leading to misdiagnoses. Professor Chris Clark from the University of Exeter Medical School led the study and said: "Our new method will give a more accurate blood pressure reading for around two percent more people. This doesn't sound a big number but remember, around a third of adults have high blood pressure and once you get into your 60s it's more than half of the adults. The NHS Health Check Programme diagnoses 38,000 new cases annually in England alone, so two percent equates to 750 fewer potential misdiagnoses per year in England, and tens of thousands globally." Researchers used statistical modelling on arm and ankle blood pressure readings from 33,710 people (mean age 58 years, 45 per cent female) across the world to help describe the relationship between arm and ankle blood pressures, predict arm blood pressure using ankle blood pressure readings, and predict important health outcomes (such as risk of heart attacks) from ankle blood pressure readings. This research could help address a health inequality by providing accurate and personalised blood pressure measurements for people who previously could not have their blood pressure measured accurately from their arm. It's estimated there are up to 10,000 adults currently living in the UK with upper limb loss, while 75 per cent of the country's 1.3 million stroke survivors have upper limb dysfunction, sometimes making it difficult to measure blood pressure from their arm. Someone in the UK has a stroke every five minutes, with high blood pressure accounting for around half of those. Around two-thirds of stroke survivors will leave hospital with some form of disability, including paralysis in an arm, which can prevent getting accurate blood pressure readings from the affected limb. Professor Kevin Munro, Director of NIHR's Research for Patient Benefit Programme, said: "This research has identified an ingenious solution to an important problem - finding a way to measure blood pressure for people who cannot have it monitored via the upper arm. Keeping track of blood pressure is a vital tool to help keep people healthy and this NIHR-funded research will help to spot high blood pressure and treat it even more widely." An individual participant data meta-analysis from the INTERPRESS-IPD Collaboration' is published in BMJ Open. TV presenter Sue Kent, 62 from Swansea, has an upper limb disability caused by the drug Thalidomide, which was prescribed to her mother during pregnancy. She has eight-inch arms which aren't big enough for blood pressure to be taken. Whether it was accurate or not nobody worried, but I didn't seem to have blood pressure problems. She said: "I was worried I was going to have a stroke because Meniere's can be an indicator the blood flow isn't going to the brain. Prodding about in the dark and guessing isn't really a safe thing to do. You need the right information about your blood pressure." Sue hopes this new method could potentially help her and thousands of others like her have something most of us take for granted – an accurate blood pressure reading. "When you're disabled, you're more likely to die younger for a variety of reasons, so this resource tips the scales a bit more in our favour. This could put us on a level playing field with everybody else when it comes to blood pressure. It means reassurance and maybe an early diagnosis if something is wrong."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stroke and dementia as well as late-life depression are more common in people who have a biomarker of aging called short leukocyte telomere length, according to a study published on June 11, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The good news is that this relationship was not found in people with healthy lifestyle habits, such as eating healthy and maintaining low cholesterol and blood pressure. The study does not prove that shorter telomeres cause these brain diseases; it only shows an association. Our findings support the potential benefits of working to improve your risk factors such as maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol and getting enough sleep and exercise in reducing the risk of age-related brain disease even in people who are already showing signs of damaging biological aging." Telomeres are protective caps at the end of chromosomes. They shorten each time cells divide, making them key biomarkers of biological aging, reflecting the cumulative biological stresses a person has experienced. This study looked at the length of telomeres in white blood cells, called leukocytes. For the study, researchers analyzed records of 356,173 people in the United Kingdom with an average age of 56 who had information on the length of their leukocyte telomeres and about their risk factors such as diet and smoking. The participants were divided into three groups based on how long their telomeres were: short, medium or long. The researchers also looked at a modified Brain Care Score that evaluates risk factors associated with stroke, dementia and late-life depression. On a 19-point scale, people with scores of 15 points or higher were considered to have good brain care and people with scores of 10 or lower were considered to have poor brain care. During that time, 25,964 people developed at least one age-related brain disease. When researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect the risk of brain diseases, such as age, high blood pressure and smoking, they found that people with short telomeres were 11% more likely to develop at least one of the three brain diseases than people with long telomeres. But when researchers looked at the Brain Care Scores, they found that people with short telomeres who had high Brain Care Scores did not have a higher risk of developing the brain diseases. "These results suggest that healthy lifestyle behaviors could delay the aging of our cells and reduce the frequency of these diseases, especially in people who are greater risk," Anderson said. A limitation of the study was that only people of European ancestry were included, so the results may not apply to other groups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After decades of stalled national progress in reducing the rate of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID), a category of infant mortality that includes sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), researchers at Rutgers Health have proposed an unexpected solution: Caffeine might protect babies by preventing dangerous drops in oxygen that may trigger deaths. Despite an initial decline in the 1990s with the introduction of widespread education campaigns promoting back to sleep and other safe infant sleep recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics, SIDS, even on its own, remains the leading cause of death in infants between 1 and 12 months old. "We've been concerned about why the rates haven't changed," said Thomas Hegyi, a neonatologist at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School who led the research. "So, we wanted to explore new ways of approaching the challenge." They are all associated with intermittent hypoxia, brief episodes where oxygen levels drop below 80%. Thomas Hegyi, neonatologist, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Neonatologists already use caffeine to treat apnea in premature infants, where it works as a respiratory stimulant. The drug has an excellent safety profile in babies, with minimal side effects even at high doses. What makes caffeine particularly intriguing as a proposed preventive measure is how differently infants process it. Caffeine remains in an infant's system for weeks, not hours. This unique metabolism might explain a long-standing puzzle: why SIDS peaks between two and four months of age. As infants mature, they begin metabolizing caffeine more quickly. The researchers suggest caffeine consumed during pregnancy or passed through breast milk might provide early protection that wanes as metabolism speeds up. The theory also could explain why breastfeeding appears to protect against SIDS. "We hypothesize that the protection afforded by breast milk is, in part, due to caffeine," wrote the researchers, noting caffeine readily passes from mothers to infants through breast milk. "The idea isn't that caffeine will replace risk-reduction behaviors," Ostfeld said. The researchers plan to test their hypothesis by comparing caffeine levels in infants who died of SIDS with those who died from other causes, such as trauma or disease. The research represents a fundamental shift in approaching SIDS prevention. While current strategies focus on eliminating environmental risks, this would be the first potential pharmaceutical intervention. "For over 30 years, we've been educating New Jersey's parents about adopting safe infant sleep practices. Still, for various reasons, these proven recommendations are not universally adopted," Ostfeld said. "This new hypothesis offers a way not just to address important risk factors but potentially intervene." Crucially, the researchers said this is hypothesis-generating research meant to inspire further study, not a recommendation for parents to give their babies caffeine. Any intervention would require extensive testing for safety and efficacy. As Hegyi put it, the goal is "to stimulate new thinking about a problem that has remained unchanged for 25 years."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new analysis shows that targeting high-risk regions with the IXCHIQ vaccine could dramatically curb the global impact of chikungunya, offering hope against this rapidly spreading mosquito-borne virus. Importantly, IXCHIQ was licensed based on immunological correlates of protection rather than classical phase 3 efficacy data, due to the unpredictable nature of chikungunya outbreaks. Study findings reveal that of the 180 countries analyzed, 104 experienced CHIKV transmission, corresponding to 2.8 billion exposed individuals, 35.3 million (95% CI: 20.9–56.5 million) annual CHIKV infections, and epidemic outbreaks every ~6.2 years. Vaccination models assumed 70% vaccine efficacy, 40% infection protection, and 50% coverage (individuals ≥12 yrs). These models reveal that targeted vaccination programs could prevent 4,400 (95% CI: 3,800–4,800) infections, 0.35 (0.30–0.37) deaths, and 17 (15–19) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 100,000 doses, highlighting the potential of strategic vaccination programs in significantly reducing CHIKV's disease burden and human suffering. However, these outcomes are based on modelled scenarios and remain sensitive to key assumptions regarding vaccine characteristics, coverage, duration of protection, and speed of outbreak detection and response. Endemic: CHIKV circulates persistently in the territory, with infections occurring every year. Epidemic: CHIKV circulates sporadically in the territory, with outbreaks being followed by years without detected circulation. No transmission: CHIKV does not circulate in the territory. Insufficient evidence: Epidemiological, serological, and entomological data do not provide robust evidence to support the given likely classification. Primarily transmitted by bites from infected Aedes mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus), the disease is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, joint pain (arthralgia), and rashes, with approximately 50% of detected acute cases developing chronic joint pain that may persist for several months. Despite decades of research, few clinical interventions and limited epidemiological data exist for CHIKV. Unfortunately, since CHIKV's global burden remains poorly quantified, the potential public health impact of IXCHIQ and other vaccines remains unclear. Understanding the disease's global reach is imperative before effective immunization strategies can be developed and deployed. The present review addresses these knowledge gaps by integrating multidisciplinary data sources (seroprevalence data, surveillance systems data, and geographic mosquito distribution patterns) to estimate CHIKV's global burden and model the potential benefits of vaccination campaigns. Study data was obtained via a literature review of Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, GIDEON, WHO/PAHO, and ProMED digital scientific repositories. Studies investigating countries and territories with population sizes of 200,000 or more (n = 180) were included in subsequent analyses. Where available, age-stratified seroprevalence data (n = 49), surveillance systems data (from National Ministry of Health websites), and mosquito vector maps (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) were extracted. Associations between mosquito vector data and CHIKV prevalence, 2. CHIKV transmission dynamics (using a custom Markov chain Monte Carlo [MCMC]-leveraging serocatalytic model). The results from these models were subsequently used to inform: 1. Outcomes were presented as ‘per 100,000 doses', providing both burden quantification and a vaccine-impact forecast to inform public health decision-making. The authors emphasize that their projections are sensitive to assumptions regarding vaccine efficacy, protection duration, rollout logistics, and the accuracy of disease surveillance. Review analyses revealed that ~2.8 billion individuals across 104 countries and territories are exposed to CHIKV transmission, with 2.4% and 1.6% of them contracting the infection in endemic and epidemic regions, respectively. Additionally, epidemic outbreaks were predicted to occur every ~6.2 years, each of which resulted in 8.4% of the susceptible population being infected with CHIKV. Together, these findings predict ~35.3 million (20.9–56.5 million) global infections annually, with the majority of cases concentrated in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Americas. Vaccination simulations suggest that every 100,000 IXCHIQ doses administered could avert 4,400 (3,800–4,800) CHIKV infections, prevent 0.35 (0.30–0.37) deaths, and save 17 (15–19) DALYs. Vaccination projections further suggest that IXCHIQ can provide substantial protective benefits at the population level, underscoring the benefits of deploying vaccines where and when outbreaks are imminent. The authors note that mixed or locally adapted immunization strategies may be required within countries. The paper also compares chikungunya's burden to that of dengue virus, noting that while CHIKV causes fewer symptomatic cases overall, both diseases disproportionately affect the same regions, and the patterns of endemic and epidemic transmission differ. The authors highlight that a significant proportion of CHIKV infections may be subclinical, meaning true infection numbers are likely higher than reported case data. Vaccine safety considerations are addressed, with clinical trial data showing that severe adverse events occurred in approximately 2% of recipients and mild-to-moderate arthralgia in up to 18%, although these were not included in the DALY calculations. Ongoing and future phase 4 studies are expected to further clarify the real-world effectiveness and safety profile of these vaccines. Together, these findings provide a quantified rationale for prioritizing high-risk regions and inform public health agencies of the ideal immunization strategies to reduce CHIKV-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. This review presents the first comprehensive estimate of CHIKV's global burden, demonstrating the potential of CEPI's novel IXCHIQ (modeled) and VIMKUNYA (approved but not modeled) vaccines in mitigating disease outcomes, thereby preventing thousands of infections, dozens of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), and CHIKV-associated mortality per 100,000 doses in outbreak settings. It highlights high-risk regions (countries or territories), their endemic or epidemic status, and the strategic importance of timely CHIKV vaccinations. Overall, this review informs IXCHIQ deployment policy by utilizing evidence-based transmission and risk data, thereby optimizing vaccine use to significantly reduce disease and suffering. However, the authors caution that the modelled benefits depend on rapid outbreak detection, efficient stockpile deployment, and the ability to adapt vaccination strategies to local epidemiology and healthcare infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new pilot project led by McGill University researchers is showing early success in helping cancer survivors return to work, addressing an aspect of recovery they say is often overlooked. iCanWork is an online support program being developed by Christine Maheu, Associate Professor at McGill's Ingram School of Nursing, in collaboration with BC Cancer. Work isn't considered a key health indicator in cancer care, even though it's a major concern from the moment someone is diagnosed and is associated with better quality of life in survivors." Christine Maheu, Associate Professor at McGill's Ingram School of Nursing Lingering side effects of cancer treatment like fatigue, "chemo brain" and anxiety can make it hard to focus, stay organized and manage stress, making the return to work feel overwhelming, she explained. In a randomized trial involving 24 cancer survivors, Maheu and her colleagues evaluated the effectiveness of iCanWork. In the 10-step program, survivors met virtually with return-to-work counsellors and therapists who helped manage the hurdles to reintegration and referred them to additional specialists when needed. "One participant said without the sessions, she would have quit. Another had considered early retirement but changed her plans," said Maheu. The first-of-its-kind program aims to fill a gap in Canadian cancer care. Only four per cent of employers have cancer-specific return-to-work policies, which the authors say are more common in some European countries. Maheu said previous research shows that, on average, cancer patients face over $2,500 a month in lost wages and out-of-pocket expenses like medication and home care. "Having proper support in place benefits both sides," said Maheu. The team is preparing a larger trial and looking for partners to help scale iCanWork across Canada. The structured program tested in the study is still in development, but survivors can already access tools and resources through the Cancer and Work website, launched in 2016 and recognized with the 2020 CIHR Inclusive Research Excellence Prize for its accessible and inclusive design.
