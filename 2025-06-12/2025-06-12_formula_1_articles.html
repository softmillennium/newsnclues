IT'S RACE WEEK: 5 storylines we're excited about ahead of the 2025 Canadian Grand Prix You need a good front-end to get your car turned into the chicanes, which are pretty much everywhere. GALLERY: Check out Haas' special livery for their 200th Grand Prix in Canada If not there, maybe you'll have a little sniff of something into Turn 1. Turns 1 and 2 are pretty tricky because you're approaching Turn 1 very, very fast, arcing to the right as you're braking, and then hurling speed to the left. And tyre warm-up sometimes isn't ideal here, particularly on chillier days in Montreal. ONBOARD: George Russell's 2024 Pirelli Pole Position Award lap at the Canadian Grand Prix Verstappen and Russell set the exact same time in Qualifying for the 2024 Canadian Grand Prix, but it was Verstappen who won on race day Graining, especially during free practice on Friday, could put in an appearance, but as the track gradually rubbers-in it shouldn't be a factor. Lap times come down really quickly, not just from one day to the next, but also during each session. This has boosted his points tally to a total of 186. McLaren team mate Lando Norris, meanwhile, only sits 10 points behind in second place. READ MORE: Stella gives his take on Piastri's 'cheeky' comment and how McLaren will manage intra-team fight going forward The Dutchman lost ground in Barcelona after being handed a 10-second time penalty following a collision with George Russell, dropping him from an original result of P5 down to P10. While he still sits third in the championship, Verstappen is now 49 points adrift of Piastri, and his punishment in Spain has also resulted in the Red Bull driver being just one penalty point away from an automatic race suspension. The squad will be hoping that the conditions favour them as they look to get ahead in an intriguing fight between themselves, Red Bull and Ferrari. Elsewhere, Williams will be keen to reaffirm their status as the leaders of the midfield following a difficult outing in Barcelona, while things remain very much all to play for behind them as Racing Bulls try to fend off their rivals in the scrap for P6.
