The judge said that Khalil must be released on Friday, giving the government time to appeal.

A federal judge has ruled that the government can no longer hold pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil under Secretary of State Marco Rubio's claims that he poses a threat to national security. 

U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz blocked the government from deporting Khalil and ordered him to be released on Friday, but gave the government time to appeal his release.

In his decision, Farbiarz wrote that Khalil will continue to suffer irreparable harm if he continues to be detained, having already lost a job offer from Oxfam International and been blocked from witnessing the birth of his firstborn child. 

The judge found no basis for continuing to hold Khalil based on Rubio's determination that Khalil's presence in the U.S. compromises foreign policy interests, which Farbiarz said was the government's main argument for seeking to detain and deport Khalil.

Khalil's legal team celebrated the decision as a major win, demanding that Khalil now be released. This is the first time a federal court has ruled that Khalil and others hit with similar charges cannot be deported on the foreign policy argument under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the ACLU and the Center for Constitutional Rights, which are representing Khalil, said in a press release.

“This vindicates what Mahmoud has maintained since day one — that the government cannot detain or deport him based on Rubio's say-so,” said Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer for Khalil, in a statement. “ICE should now do the right thing and release Mahmoud immediately so he can return to his wife, Noor, and their newborn baby boy, Deen.”

Kassem has warned, however, that they “aren't out of the woods” until Khalil is out of immigration detention.

Noor Abdalla, Khalil's wife, expressed hope that Khalil could be released in time for Father's Day on Sunday. 

“This is the news we've been waiting over three months for,” said Abdalla. “True justice would mean Mahmoud was never taken away from us in the first place, that no Palestinian father, from New York to Gaza, would have to endure the painful separation of prison walls like Mahmoud has. I will not rest until Mahmoud is free, and hope that he can be with us to experience his first Father's Day at home in New York with Deen in his arms.”

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said that it intends to appeal the ruling. 

“Today's ruling delays justice and seeks to undermine the President's constitutionally vested powers under Article II,” said DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.

Farbiarz wrote that the government could still make an argument that Khalil failed to fill out his green card application correctly — even though the government itself seems to have overstepped numerous statutory authorities in order to arrest and detain Khalil. Farbiarz further noted that the government does not seem to be detaining him for reasons related to his application, and that that is an extremely rare reason for someone to be detained.

A unique Le Birkin handbag, the only one of its kind made for the British-born singer and actor Jane Birkin, is to go on sale in Paris.

The prototype model of the iconic Hermès bag, which Birkin used for nine years, is expected to fetch a six-figure sum at auction next month.

Well-used and still bearing traces of the stickers Birkin irreverently stuck on the smooth black leather, the bag comes complete with the nail clippers she attached inside.

The head of handbags and fashion at Sotheby's, Aurélie Vassy, said it was unique.

“It was the first bag given to Jane Birkin and it's obvious that she made remarks and suggestions about the prototype. It's not Le Birkin we all know and love, which was a kind of collaboration between her and Hermès,” she said. “The prototype is a one-off. There is no other bag like it in the world.”

The creation of Le Birkin is a fashion legend that came about after Birkin's chance encounter with the head of the French luxury goods company, Jean-Louis Dumas, on a commercial flight from Paris to London in 1984.

In a 2018 interview with CBS, Birkin, who died in July 2023, said: “I found myself next door to a very polite gentleman and I had my agenda as usual banged full of bits of paper and everything and the whole thing fell to the ground.

“So I picked it up and he said: ‘You should have pockets in that agenda'. And I said: ‘What can you do? Hermès don't make it with pockets', and he said: ‘I am Hermès'.

“I said: ‘Why don't you make a handbag that's a bit bigger than the Kelly and not as big as my suitcase, which weighs a ton … there was the sort of vomit bag and I did a wee sketch and he took it with him, and a month later I got a call from Hermès saying would I come and have a look at this bag.”

Birkin auctioned the prototype handbag in 1994 for the benefit of a French Aids charity. It was auctioned again in 2000 and bought by the current owner, a collector of luxury goods, who has declined to say how much she paid for it.

Birkin's subsequent relationship with the exclusive bag that now sells for thousands new and hundreds of thousands secondhand, was mixed. Hermès gave her four more, but in a 2012 interview she described it as the “bloody Birkin bag”, complaining they were heavy and “snobbish”. Three years later, she asked Hermès to rename a crocodile-skin version because of concerns about the treatment of the animals used to produce it.

The original bag has been exhibited at MoMa in New York and the V&A Museum in London. The prototype is a different size to later models, has a shoulder strap and brass hardware, later replaced with gold-plate rings, clasps and “feet”.

“People love it because of its origin and its history. It's like a celebrated work of art, it has an energy and soul of its own,” Vassy said. “This bag was the very beginning of Le Birkin and we know Jane was proud to have it.”

The bag will be sold on 10 July at the beginning of haute couture week in Paris.

            • Deadly crash: At least 290 people are dead after a passenger plane crashed on departure at an airport in Ahmedabad, India, authorities told Reuters. The plane hit a hostel for doctors when it crashed, and images show the tail of the plane protruding from the building. The death toll includes people on the plane and others on the ground, police said.
    


            • At least one survivor: There were 242 people aboard the Air India flight, which was en route to London, the airline said. At least one passenger survived the crash, local police said.
    


            • Boeing's response: The plane was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, according to Flightradar24. It's the first major incident involving the aircraft, and Boeing said it is ready to support Air India.
    


            • Safety record: Air India has seen a few rare but high-profile plane crashes through the years. Previous accidents have spurred Indian authorities to improve its safety and infrastructure, but challenges remain.
    


            US President Donald Trump expressed concern about the fatal plane crash in India on Thursday and said he has pledged US support if needed in its aftermath.
    


            A Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plane en route to London crashed on departure at an airport in India's western city of Ahmedabad, with more than 200 people feared dead.
    


                    “The plane crash was terrible. I've already told them, anything we can do — it's a big country, a strong country, they'll handle it — I'm sure. But I let them know that anything we can do, we'll be over there immediately. But it was a horrific crash,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
                





            Trump said he “gave them a couple of pointers” but declined to share what pointers he offered.
    


            At least 290 people have died after an Air India plane crashed shortly after take off from Ahmedabad airport in India on Thursday, Reuters reported, citing local officials.
    


            Among those killed include passengers on the flight, and people who were inside the BJ Medical College and Hospital hostel when the plane crashed into it.
    


            “Approximately 294 have died. This includes some students as the plane crashed on the building where they were staying,” Vidhi Chaudhary, a top state police officer, told Reuters.
    


            Earlier Thursday, Swapnil Bhalodia of the Indian Medical Association Medical Students Network said at least three medical students had died in the crash and another 30 others were injured.
    


            The plane was headed for London's Gatwick airport and was carrying Indian, British, Canadian and Portuguese nationals.
    


            At least one passenger on board Air India Flight 171 to London Gatwick survived, local police said.
    


            According to Reuters, senior police officer Vidhi Chaudhary said the man had been in seat 11A and added that there may be a few more survivors in the hospital.
    


            The Hindustan Times named the survivor as a British national, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, and said he was receiving treatment. What appears to be a copy of the flight manifest, shared by news agency IANS, lists Vishwash Kumar Ramesh as having been assigned seat 11A and boarded.
    


            The Hindustan Times said it spoke to Ramesh in a local hospital, and quoted him as saying: “Thirty seconds after takeoff, there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed. It all happened so quickly.”
    


            Ramesh  told the Hindustan Times that he had been visiting family and was returning to the UK with his brother, who had been sitting in a different row. He didn't know if his brother had survived, he said.
    


            An Air India flight en route to London carrying 242 passengers and crew crashed shortly after taking off from the western city of Ahmedabad in India's Guajarat state earlier today.
    


Here's what we know so far about the crash: 



Timeline: According to aviation tracker Flightradar24, Air India Flight 171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, departed from Ahmedabad International airport at 1:38 p.m. local time (4:08 a.m. ET) with a destination of London Gatwick Airport. The aircraft's signal was lost less than a minute later, at an altitude of 625 feet.

Casualties: Air India's CEO Campbell Wilson said in a social media video message today that injured passengers were taken to a local hospitals and a “special team of caregivers from Air India is on their way to Ahmedabad to provide additional support.” More than 200 people are feared dead, but the number of casualties is not immediately clear. Ahmedabad's police commissioner told The Associated Press earlier that it appeared there are no survivors.
    


In the surrounding area: The Federation of All India Medical Association said between 50 and 60 students have been admitted to local hospitals after the flight crashed into the hostel at the BJ Medical College and Hospital. Some residents and their relatives are said to be missing, while one resident's wife has been found dead, according to a statement from the group.
    


Who was onboard? Wilson said that 230 passengers boarded the flight that was manned by 12 crew members. He confirmed 169 Indian nationals, 53 British nationals, seven Portuguese nationals and one Canadian national were on board.
    


Investigation: India's civil aviation authorities would be expected to take the lead, according to CNN's Richard Quest, but “parties to the investigation” would also likely include the US, where the aircraft is manufactured, and the UK, the destination country. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it will be leading a team that is heading to India to assist local authorities' probe into the crash. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has also formally offered its assistance to India's authorities following the crash.
    


Boeing's response: Boeing said it is in contact with the airline. “Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected,” it added in an X post. This is the latest in a string of incidents for the plane manufacturer over the past few years.
    


Support for victims: Tata Group, the owner of Air India and one of India's largest conglomerates, has said it will provide ₹1 crore ($116,868) to the families of each person who has lost their life, the company announced in a post on X.
    


            Tata Group, the owner of Air India and one of India's largest conglomerates, has said it will provide ₹1 crore ($116,868) to the families of each person who has lost their life in the Ahmedabad plane crash, the company announced in a post on X.
    


            “We will also cover the medical expenses of those injured and ensure that they receive all necessary care and support,” it added. “Additionally we will provide support in the building up of the B J Medical's hostel.”
    


Some background: Air India was bought by Indian multinational conglomerate Tata Group in 2022, and was widely regarded as a historic homecoming. Originally founded by J.R.D. Tata in 1932 before being nationalized in 1953, the deal marked the return of Air India to its original owners after nearly 70 years of government control.
    


CNN's Rhea Mogul contributed reporting.



            The Federation of All India Medical Association said between 50 and 60 students have been admitted to local hospitals after an Air India flight crashed into the hostel at the BJ Medical College and Hospital.
    


            The statement said four or five students are missing and another two or three others are in intensive care.
    


            Separately, three to four relatives of resident doctors are missing, and one resident's wife has been found dead.
    


            The association called for blood donations from those who are able following the crash.
    


            Injured passengers found at the crash site were taken to local hospitals in Ahemdabad, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said in a social media video message.
    


                    “Injured passengers have been taken by local authorities to the nearest hospitals. We are actively working with authorities on all emergency response efforts,” Wilson said.  “A special team of caregivers from Air India is on their way to Ahmedabad to provide additional support,” he added. 
                





            Earlier, the Ahmedabad city police commissioner told The Associated Press that there appeared to be no survivors from the crashed plane.
    


            The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has formally offered its assistance to India's authorities following the crash of Air India Flight AI171.
    


            The AAIB is “deploying a multidisciplinary investigation team to India to support the Indian led investigation,” it said in a statement to CNN. “This is in accordance with ICAO [International Civil Aviation Organization] Annex 13 because UK citizens were on board the aircraft.”
    


            “Our thoughts are with all those affected by this tragic accident,” the agency added.
    


            Annex 13 outlines how accident investigation participation is determined.
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it will be leading a team of US investigators who are heading to India to assist local authorities' probe into the crash of a Boeing passenger plane, according to a NTSB statement posted on X.



            The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) allows for US agencies, like the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration, to other countries into crash investigations. ICAO references 19 technical annexes to maintain uniformity in international civil aviation, and annex 13 outlines how accident investigation participation is determined.
    


            Due to international protocols under the ICAO's Annex 13, all information from the investigation will be provided by the Government of India. The regulation requires the issuance of an accident investigation preliminary report within 30 days of the event and a final report as soon as possible or within a year of the event.
    


            The same protocol was followed after last year's deadly Jeju Air flight 2216 crash in South Korea.
    


            In a post on X, acting Federal Aviation Administration  Administrator Chris Rocheleau said the agency is “deeply saddened” by the crash and “is actively working with the NTSB and stands ready to support our international partners during this difficult time.”
    


            Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he's “devastated” to learn about the Air India crash in Ahmedabad.
    


            One Canadian national was on the flight, Carney said.
    


            “Canada's transportation officials are in close contact with counterparts and I am receiving regular updates as the response to this tragedy unfolds,” he said in a post on X.
    


            Video shared to social media video shows flames and thick smoke billowing into the air as the Air India passenger plane crashed shortly after takeoff.
    


            The plane had departed Ahmedabad's airport and was bound for London's Gatwick Airport.
    


            Today's crash of an Air India flight on a Boeing 787-8 airplane is the latest in a string of safety incidents over the years for plane manufacturer Boeing Co.
    


            Over the last several years, the plane maker has dealt with a nightmare of incidents with fatal crashes and quality issues placing Boeing in the spotlight. Last year, a door plug blew out near the rear of a plane, leaving a gaping hole in the fuselage during the Alaska Airlines flight. Investigators are set to have a meeting later this month on the incident.
    


            And at the tailend of 2024, Boeing saw another devastating incident. In South Korea, a crash on a Jeju Air flight killed 179 people on December 29 in what was in the year's worst aviation disaster. The cause of the crash of the 15-year-old Boeing jet is still under investigation.
    


            Boeing's 787-8 Dreamliner — the type of plane involved in today's crash, according to data from Flightradar24 — hasn't seen crashes at this magnitude in its history, however, there have been other incidents. This year, four passengers and two crew members were injured on a United Airlines flight that made a sudden jolt in the air.
    


            The company has experienced one misstep to the next over the last six years, starting with the 20-month grounding of its best selling plane, the 737 Max, following two fatal crashes in late 2018 and early 2019, which killed 346 people.
    


            Boeing has also felt the financial burden of its many problems. At the start of 2025, the company had lost $39.3 billion since early 2019 and reported losses in virtually every quarter since then.
    


            The United Kingdom's King Charles said he and Queen Camilla are “desperately shocked” by the “terrible events” in Ahmedabad.
    


            “Our special prayers and deepest possible sympathy are with the families and friends of all those affected by this appallingly tragic incident across so many nations, as they await news of their loved ones,” the King said in a message posted to the Royal Family's official X account.
    


            He also paid tribute to the “heroic efforts” of the emergency services and all those “providing help and support at this most heartbreaking and traumatic time.”
    


            This video, obtained by CNN, shows parts of Air India Flight 171 on top of a building in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad.
    


            The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says it is in contact with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) regarding Air India flight AI171.
    


            “When an international incident occurs, that government leads the investigation,” the FAA said in a statement. “In the event assistance is requested, the NTSB is the official U.S. representative and the FAA provides technical support.”
    


            It added: “We stand ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB.”
    


            Boeing has issued a new statement about the Air India crash, saying it is in contact with the airline and stands “ready to support them.”
    


            “Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected,” it added in an X post.
    


            There were 242 people on the AI171 flight, and the Ahmedabad city police commissioner told The Associated Press that there appears to be no survivors from the crashed plane.
    


            A reception center for relatives of passengers on board the Air India Flight 171 has been established at London's Gatwick Airport.
    


            The center will provide information and support to relatives of victims.
    


            “British nationals who require consular assistance or have concerns about friends or family should call 020 7008 5000,” the airport shared on social media.
    


            There were 53 British nationals on the flight.
    


Some context: The UK and India have strong cultural and historic ties and a complicated history dating back to Britain's colonial era. The UK has a large Indian diaspora. According to data from the British government, in 2021, 1.9 million people — or 3.1% of the country's population — identified as having Indian ethnicity.
    


            The Ahmedabad city police commissioner told The Associated Press that there appears to be no survivors from the crashed plane.
    


            “It appears there are no survivors in the plane crash,” Commissioner G.S. Malik told the AP.
    


            He added that with the plane crashing in a residential area with offices, “some locals would have also died.”
    


            “Exact figures on casualties are being ascertained,” he said.
    


            Video shared on social media from the scene shows witnesses rushing to an enormous black plume of smoke as it rises up above the sky.
    


            Ahmedabad Airport has resumed operations with limited flights, it said in a post on X.
    


            It added that passengers are advised to contact their respective airlines for the latest flight schedule.

Governor condemns federal deployment of troops in Los Angeles as ‘theater' in interview with the Daily podcast

LA protests – live updates

Gavin Newsom, California's governor, has called Donald Trump a “stone cold liar”, condemned the federal deployment of troops in Los Angeles as “theater” and “madness” and even questioned the president's mental fitness, as protests over immigration raids in the city continue.

Trump federalized 2,000 of California's national guard on Saturday, with a US president acting over the objections of a state governor in this way for the first time in more than half a century. It followed the outbreak of protests over a series of sweeping immigration raids in the LA area, with Newsom criticizing Trump's actions as illegal overreach, unconstitutional and “provocation”.

Now US marines are being added to this force to back up arrests by the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency, in tactics Newsom said have been used to “disappear” people unlawfully in these raids rather than confront the protesters who have destroyed property around an Ice facility in downtown Los Angeles.

Newsom, a Democrat, said that Trump never raised with him the federalizing of the national guard before it occurred, when the two spoke by phone last Friday, despite the president's claims to the contrary. “He lied, stone cold liar,” the governor told the New York Times podcast the Daily on Thursday morning in an interview.

Of the subsequent rare commanding of the national guard troops by the president, rather than the governor, Newsom told the Daily: “It came completely out of left field.”

The federalized national guard have been taken from their duties on the border and working in California's forests to clear undergrowth to prevent wildfires and have had to be protected by police as protesters were specifically angry at them being deployed by the president, Newsom said.

“That is how ridiculous this whole thing is,” he said. “This is theater, it's madness, it's unconstitutional, it's immoral. It puts people's lives at risk, these people are being used as pawns.”

Newsom said that “looting is unacceptable” but that more than 1,600 police were dealing with the situation and his greater concern was the “thuggish behavior” of the Trump administration in ordering the military on to the streets of a US city. Several members of the federalized national guard have told friends and family they are deeply unhappy about the deployment.

“This sends fear and chills up the spines of law-abiding citizens,” said Newsom, who has warned that other states and US democracy itself is under threat from the presidential overreach. “That is a red line crossed, it is a serious and profound moment in American history.”

Newsom told local media that Trump's age seemed to be affecting him.

He claimed to the Times that the president can't recall the phone conversation they had on Friday and that “he's not all there”, echoing comments first made by the governor on Monday that Trump, who turns 79 on Saturday, is “incapable of even a train of thought” and that he has “lost it”.

Trump has said that he wants to “liberate” Los Angeles from protesters and has escalated a feud with Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2028, by even suggesting the governor himself could be arrested. Los Angeles was calmer on Wednesday evening than at the weekend and the city's mayor, Karen Bass, has emphasized in local appearances how small an area has been affected by any trouble, with a limited area under curfew and no looting experienced there overnight into Thursday.

However, as protests continue, several hundred further arrests were made late on Wednesday.

Newsom also said in the interview broadcast, published on Thursday, that his 15-year-old daughter came home from school crying at the prospect of him being arrested. “I said that doesn't matter, what matters is the military on the streets,” he said. “I will handle that, I will be fine. I am worried about you, I'm worried about this country, I'm worried about everything we've taken for granted and fought so hard for disappearing overnight.”

The protests have spread to other cities including New York, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Seattle and Spokane in Washington state, Austin and San Antonio in Texas. Meanwhile immigration “enforcement activity” has extended to California's agricultural heartland, where many farm workers are undocumented people.

Los Angeles area mayors on Wednesday called on the Trump administration with withdraw troops and stop the raids that have caused widespread fear in immigrant communities.

“I'm asking you, please listen to me, stop terrorizing our residents,” said Jessica Ancona, the mayor of El Monte, who said she was struck by rubber bullets during a recent raid in the city.

On Wednesday, Trump was both booed and cheered while attending a performance of Les Misérables in Washington at the Kennedy Center in the capital, which he took over after returning to the White House. And Trump said that the actions in Los Angeles were necessary. “If I didn't act quickly on that, Los Angeles would be burning to the ground right now,” Trump said.

Governments at all levels from both parties have paved the way to an authoritarian response to dissent.

Governments at all levels from both parties have paved the way to an authoritarian response to dissent.

When did the act of public protest — a right protected by the First Amendment — become an act of “rebellion” eliciting a military response? What began as a fairly small protest against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at an apparel manufacturer in the Fashion District in downtown Los Angeles on June 6, led to an immediate response by federal agents in riot gear using pepper spray and “nonlethal bullets” to clear a path for vans to leave with detainees. This response in turn led to a larger mobilization that evening at the Los Angeles Federal Building downtown, demanding an end to all ICE raids in the city. By Saturday, June 7, as protests continued to grow, the LAPD declared all assembly in downtown Los Angeles illegal, and President Donald Trump, against the wishes of the California government, called in the National Guard, leading to violence, tear gas, and arrests.

This coordinated repression did not come from nowhere. In 2024, The New York Times reported that the Trump transition team was already planning to use emergency powers, such as the one Trump invoked on June 7, to confront political opponents who protest the administration. While the Trump administration planned this move for about a year, the deployment of troops in Los Angeles is the brutal culmination of a yearslong campaign to systematically erode and circumscribe public assembly rights, enabled by both Democrats and Republicans at all levels of government. Political scientists call this “democratic backsliding”: the gradual erosion of basic rights, civil liberties, and other political institutions that allow the public to hold the government to account. This war on dissent is the most visible sign of democratic backsliding in the U.S. By using the National Guard to silence dissent in Los Angeles, the Trump administration is eroding a core pillar of democracy: the right to assemble in public to express opinions contrary to government action and to advocate for change.

The recent developments in Los Angeles suggest new trends in the logic of protest policing. During the civil rights movement, in which police faced strong backlash when they clashed violently with activists, U.S. police forces developed a new approach to public order policing called “negotiated management” in the 1980 and 1990s. Under negotiated management, police tried to respect the right of public assembly during large-scale public demonstrations to minimize clashes between protesters and police. However, in response to the anti-globalization protests at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, during which organizers refused to meet with police, police shifted to a new set of tactics called “strategic incapacitation” that would provide them with more control. This harsher and more repressive model aims to prevent protesters from engaging in serious public disruption (such as stopping traffic) by carefully containing protests — and in some cases, using aggressive tactics, such as penning protesters, mass arrests, and dispersal of protests through “nonlethal” chemical agents and rubber bullets to prevent large-scale protests from even taking place.

Strategic incapacitation was presented as a combination of technologically advanced and “humane” tactics, given police use of “nonlethal” tools. But in fact, Anna Feigenbaum at University of Glasgow and author of Tear Gas, told Truthout: “Tear gas is promoted as a ‘nonlethal' form of crowd control, but in fact often causes harm, including serious injuries and even deaths. The use of these weapons by police and National Guard to suppress protests is often indiscriminate and dangerous.” 

In the post-9/11 security state, the police also found themselves with more resources and political power. As a result, police combine these new tactics with advances in technology to disrupt protests through surveillance and even pre-emptive arrests.

However, the events in Los Angeles appear to be moving beyond the control, surveillance, and use of technology that makes up strategic incapacitation. Instead, Trump's federal overreach suggests the beginnings of a newer, even more sinister form of public order policing.

Reflecting on the current situation, Daniel Edler, research associate at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, told Truthout: “For me, what's happening in LA is nothing like that. Maybe the LAPD tried to apply strategic incapacitation, but if so, it clearly failed. I'd characterize the use of the National Guard and Marines as a return to ‘escalated force,' similar to the violent scenes in the 1950s and 1960s in Selma.”

This trend toward a newer and more repressive form of public order policing is not solely a Trump innovation. Democratic Party presidencies deployed these tactics against major protest movements, such as Occupy Wall Street, the climate change movement, and the campus protests against the War in Gaza. And the Trump administration in its first term supported similar tactics to crack down on the Black Lives Matter uprising in 2020 — the largest nonviolent mass protest movement in U.S. history. 

In addition to this shift in police tactics, successive governments at all levels in the U.S. have developed a legal and rhetorical toolkit to justify authoritarian response to dissent. The right-wing lobbying group ALEC has spent the last decade encouraging state legislatures to rewrite anti-riot laws so that common nonviolent protest tactics, such as blocking roads and locking oneself onto fixed objects, are classified as acts of rioting, and can lead to felony charges.

Trump administration has been testing the legal and political limits of its capacity to use the state to crush political opposition. With that precedent in place, the administration is now escalating this repression.

Rhetorically, politicians try to equate traditional nonviolent protest tactics with actions by lawless mobs. During the campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza in the spring of 2024, President Joe Biden condemned student protesters and justified their repression by arguing that they were not “peaceful” — despite minimal accounts of physical violence by protesters, and negligible accounts of property damage.

While classic proponents of nonviolent civil disobedience, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Mohandas Gandhi, have preached the need for nonviolent direct action, they also understood that protest required activists to disturb the peace, to stage a confrontation, in order to make an injustice manifest, and pressure authorities to change course. By blurring the distinction between disruptive nonviolent actions and violence, Biden paved the way for the authoritarian oppression by the Trump administration that we are witnessing today.

Since returning to office in January, the Trump administration has progressively ramped up its tools for silencing dissent. One of its very first targets were international students on U.S. college campuses who had participated in protests against the war in Gaza. ICE arrested these protesters, often without due process, as a means to both target universities that the Trump administration perceived as political enemies, and with an eye toward removing potential leaders of an opposition movement from the U.S. Again, this repeats the pattern of “strategic incapacitation,” whereby police target leaders of protest movements to prevent future demonstrations from taking place. By weaponizing the bureaucratic power of the Office of Homeland Security to revoke visas of political opponents, the Trump administration has been testing the legal and political limits of its capacity to use the state to crush political opposition. With that precedent in place, the administration is now escalating this repression. The tactics used against foreign students are now being directed towards another vulnerable group: undocumented migrants, and their political supporters.

By beginning with vulnerable groups who have less legal standing and social capital to resist repression, the Trump administration is making a strategic choice, hoping to provoke less public outcry and then use these precedents of repression later against a broader population. This is a textbook example of democratic backsliding, similar to what we have witnessed in countries, such as Poland and Hungary, in recent years. The government targets marginalized groups and unpopular causes to establish the precedent of undermining public assembly rights. Once the practice is normalized, it is then deployed against broader segments of the public.

The Trump administration has shifted from bureaucratic threats to armed suppression of political opponents.

Over time, the government chips away at the right to public assembly. This is dangerous for three reasons: First, the right to protest is not a favor granted by the state; it is a basic right to check the state's power. When government represses expressions of dissent via the National Guard, the government is signaling that it is no longer accountable to the people, and that it is willing to counter dissent with force. Second, these moves use fear to demobilize opposition. The image of the National Guard being deployed against protesters signals to citizens that the cost of speaking out has risen significantly. Democracy is eroded not through a violent explosion, but through the quiet (and often rational) decision by millions of citizens to stay home. Third, repressing dissent in this way breaks a basic democratic feedback loop. Protest is essential to a democracy. It is a real-time barometer of public discontent that holds governments to account between infrequent elections. To crush dissent in this way, the Trump administration (already historically unpopular in public opinion polling) is signaling that it has no interest in listening to dissenting opinions, but only to stamp dissent out.

The soldiers on the street of Los Angeles have laid the stakes bare. We are witnessing a crisis in U.S. democracy. The Trump administration has shifted from bureaucratic threats to armed suppression of political opponents. We must choose what we find more dangerous: the inconvenience of a blocked street and a noisy protest, or the convenience of a silent street and a docile public. The former is the messy and uncomfortable sound of a thriving democracy. The latter is the quiet, orderly silence of an authoritarian state. This is no time to stay at home. We must take to the streets and demand that elected officials at every level of government condemn the use of military and police force against protesters.

Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about solidarity, organizing, and the work of making change. I'm your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. This week, we're talking about immigration raids, rising authoritarianism, mass protest, innocence narratives, and what it means to organize effectively in this moment. In the first week of June, ICE agents carried out raids and made immigration arrests in multiple sanctuary cities, sparking protest and resistance. As we make sense of these events — and potentially step into the fray ourselves — it's crucial to understand the threats we face, how we got here, and how our language and framing can either strengthen or sabotage our efforts. Today, we'll hear from author and organizer Silky Shah, who is the executive director of Detention Watch Network — a national coalition working to abolish immigration detention in the United States. Silky is also a Truthout contributor and the author of Unbuild Walls: Why Immigrant Justice Needs Abolition. I hope you find her insights as grounding and clarifying as I have.

KH: Silky Shah, welcome to “Movement Memos.”

SS: Thanks for having me. It's good to be here with you.

KH: I know this is an incredibly difficult time, and that folks who are organizing in defense of immigrants are under tremendous pressure right now. So I just want to start by asking, how are you doing? And how's your team holding up?

SS: It's a hard question to answer. I think there is a real sense of grief and fear and concern for all the people that we work with and our families and our communities and our members, just given the escalation that we're seeing right now. And at the same time, people are paying attention, people are fighting back, people are in the streets, and I think that gives us a lot of places to do the work, to say, “Okay, these are the ways that we fight back. How can we be strategic in this moment? How can we see the opportunity in people paying attention?”

So it's confusing because I think in a lot of ways, under the Biden administration, people weren't paying attention. People thought things were fine, and actually so much of what happened during those years set us up for where we are now. And so I think these are the moments when organizations like Detention Watch Network, and people who have been focused on immigration enforcement, have a lot of work to do and a lot of ways to bring people in. But at the same time, the fight is that much more immense and it's tough and devastating to see what's happening.

KH: Well, I deeply appreciate the work you're doing, and I am so grateful that you were able to make the time to talk about what's been happening, so that we all might be better equipped to face the situation and do our part. 

SS: I think the thing I've been saying for the last few months is, this is the time for political education. This is the time for really understanding these systems. It feels hard because our levers of power are different and we have to adapt and adjust. I started doing this work back after 9/11 and, for years and years, we just lost campaigns or didn't win, and we would just be like, “Okay, we're going to just keep trying and keep trying.” And then at some point we had some openings. And so I think that's the way to think about this moment is, this is the time to be building up. This is the time for political education and to bring people in so that we're ready whenever those opportunities do arise.

KH: I couldn't agree more. I also think having a strong analysis is important in moments when people feel particularly frightened, disoriented, or fired up by what's going on around them. And I am seeing a lot of those energies at work on social media right now.

In the past week, we've seen immigration-related raids and arrests in a number of sanctuary cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and Minneapolis. These actions have included deceptive check-ins, militarized raids, and what some are calling “public spectacles” of enforcement. How do you interpret this escalation, and what do you think it signals about the administration's strategy and goals on the immigration front?

SS: For many, many years, the way that we were able to stop deportations, to push back against the rounding up of community members was through things like sanctuary policy or stopping the expansion of the detention system and also strategies for affirmative relief like deferred action for childhood arrivals, DACA or temporary protected status. So there were all these ways that the system was still rounding people up and so many people were being deported, especially in the Bush and Obama eras and going into the first Trump administration. But we adapted our strategy and said, “No.” The way that this often happened was through the criminal legal system, and because these sanctuary policies had grown, actually it was harder for ICE to round up people. And so in many ways, I think this is a response to all of those wins, and that's what happens over time. Whenever you have wins, of course, the state is going to figure out ways to go around that.

And so what we're seeing now, I think, is serving a few different purposes. We knew that work-site raids were going to be a major thing under this administration. It was true for Trump's first term. It was true for the Bush years where there would be these huge operations in places like Mississippi or Iowa where so many people would be rounded up – hundreds of people – and they were really disruptive. But they also took a lot of work planning those, and I think what we're seeing now is, especially because of this “operation at large” that Stephen Miller has really pushed this sense of, “They have to meet these numbers.” They made all these campaign promises about the millions of people who are going to be deported. And so they're trying to meet those numbers because our strategies of making sure people know their rights, making sure that sanctuary policies are in place have actually prevented the thing that they want to do.

And so they're escalating, and they're escalating by bringing in the National Guard. They're escalating by going after sanctuary cities, like you said, and trying to really scare people. And I think it's both serving the purpose of trying to meet those numbers and also instill fear in communities where there's this forced attrition and people are leaving on their own because they're scared of ending up in detention or ending up disappeared or trafficked to another country in the world (which we can talk about more). That's our understanding of what's happening, and they're evolving their strategies to both instill fear and, not just for immigrants, but also for those people who are trying to support immigrant communities.

And this is not a new playbook. I think watching the coverage of what's happening in Los Angeles, for instance, right now as we're speaking and the tear-gassing of protesters, it feels like over a decade ago when we saw the Ferguson uprising during the Black Lives Matter movement and the response and how police are responding. I think the hard part is that, in that moment, it was the militarization of police that put a lot of emphasis on how that ended up playing out. And Obama was in office there, so there was this strategy of saying, “Okay, how can we intervene here and push the Obama administration to intervene?” And right now, I think what's so scary and what's so hard, and to your question of how we're doing, we're only five months into this and this is what we're seeing. I think trying to really understand how much more this escalates and how we can make sure we're protecting our communities and we're in this for the long haul and seeing how that operates.

I think already we're seeing these questions of how is LAPD going to respond? How are these local actors? But really what we've seen time and time again is ICE doesn't operate on its own. It operates with support of law enforcement at all levels of government often. And so, I think that is going to be a real question as we see this escalation and what we can do to try to squash it and make sure that immigrant communities are protected and also those people who are taking action in support of immigrant communities.

KH: In April, you wrote that “immigrant incarceration has become a clear testing ground for this administration's authoritarianism.” Can you talk about how immigration detention is being used as a testing ground and what patterns or shifts you think people should be paying closer attention to right now?

SS: So, this administration is essentially weaponizing detention to expand its authoritarian strategies. This includes, for instance, shipping people, trafficking, or essentially state-sponsored trafficking of people to places like El Salvador or South Sudan or beyond. It includes the detention of students that are being targeted for their protest and support of Palestinian solidarity. And that I think is where we're seeing it used in a way to kind of, as many people have said, deny due process and move in this direction of people being targeted for thought crimes or people being deported or removed from the country or imprisoned indefinitely without any reason. And I think that that is a lot of what we're seeing, and part of the reason we're seeing that is because there's been many years of this system growing and growing and growing and extending to more and more people. And so, now that extension includes people like Mahmoud Khalil, like Kilmar Abrego García, who both have received a lot of attention.

But I think the thing to pay attention to right now is, I think there's a lot of focus on these particular cases, which makes a lot of sense, but also the infrastructure of detention is really changing, and it's something that I think what it portends is really a real paradigm shift in the system. The last time I think we saw significant paradigm shift was after 9/11, with the creation of DHS, and also the creation of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the expansion of more border militarization, more money going to the system, and currently there is a budget bill proposal that the House just passed that has $45 billion for detention, which is 13 times actually what the current detention budget is. And so, the fear is that more and more people will be caught up in the system as the system grows more and more. And detention, like the easiest way for this administration to deport people is by having more detention capacity.

Detention is the strategy by which… it's a facilitator of deportations. And so, right now there's roughly 50,000 people in the detention system, it's the highest it's been since 2019 under Trump's first term, and it's evolving in a lot of different ways. One is the thing that's getting the attention is of course people being shipped to the CECOT [“Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo,” which translates to “Terrorism Confinement Center” in English] prison in El Salvador, or to other locations across the world, including these terribly dystopian stories about those individuals who are sent to South Sudan and then getting moved to Djibouti where they're being held in shipping containers, in really, really deplorable conditions and life-threatening conditions. And that's really a particular escalation. I think the one thing to name about that is the US has the largest detention system because the US has the largest prison system in the world. And so, for so long, the way that we've done detention is in the US and with large capacity to detain people.

But other countries across the world, including Australia, and the UK, and Denmark, and Israel, have had these sort of schemes of detaining people offshore. And that I think is, it's not unprecedented in the global context; I think in the US context, this is a real big shift, and something we should be concerned about because I think there's also the slippery slope of what Trump has named of potentially sending citizens to CECOT who are in the federal prison system. And so, that's this constant expansion. So, I think that's one thing to be worried about, of course, there's also this expansion in use of military bases and even federal prisons here are now holding people in immigrant detention, and in addition, we're hearing a lot more stories about people being held in field offices, so essentially office buildings, where they're not set up for people to be staying there overnight or for several days or for several weeks, and these stories out of places like Massachusetts and elsewhere and Baltimore, the conditions are just getting worse and worse.

The other thing… And the thing that I really worry about though in the context of all this happening is the normalization of traditional detention, which is growing that much more, and if this budget bill passed, could grow even more and more. When you look at the detention system, a lot of it is concentrated in private prisons, which people talk about a lot, and also county jails, county jails across the country are expanding and expanding the use of immigrant detention, being used for immigrant detention. And of course, private prisons are expanding, but one of the things that has been revealed recently is that, in Florida, for instance, the Krome Detention Center, which is actually kind of in the modern era of immigrant detention, one of the first facilities that was opened up in South Florida near Miami, it was a facility that was open to detain specifically Haitian migrants in the early 80s who were fleeing a U.S.-backed dictatorship, but we're deemed economic migrants not worthy of asylum.

So, this facility has been around for a long time, and it's had terrible conditions for a really long time. But what we're hearing for instance, is because Krome is one of the five ICE-owned and operated facilities, it's required to take people regardless of the capacity. And so, you have just more and more people being sent even though they don't have the capacity. Whereas, at a private prison, they might be able to say, no, we can't take more people. And in the context when it's a government-run facility, if it's an ICE field office, if it's something else, because Stephen Miller says, because this administration is saying we need to detain more people, these places are being inundated. And I think it reveals to us that there is so much emphasis on privatization or this being a corporate strategy, and Trump's cronyism… Which is absolutely true, I'm not denying that.

But really what is happening at Krome reveals that it's the system itself that's the problem, having these ICE-owned and operated facilities – it's not like the conditions are better. And in fact, right now you could argue they were so much worse. And so, I think that it's necessary that we pay attention to that. And I feel that the infrastructure is shifting right now, and so I think for us, a lot of the questions are how do we stop the offshoring, and make sure that it doesn't become the norm while also fighting the existing detention system in the way it's expanding and evolving currently.

KH: I really share your concerns about offshoring and the importance of resisting that carceral strategy, which will undoubtedly expand in scope if it persists. Right now, I think we're seeing an effort to recreate the climate of terror we saw during Trump's first term with family separation — but this time, they're exploiting the culture of forgetting around criminalization. The goal is to make the threat of being sent to CECOT a constant source of fear and dread for immigrants, while keeping the situation forgettable for everyone else — unless someone we're absolutely certain isn't “a criminal” gets caught up in it. By labeling people as gang members, and using words like “alien enemies,” they're trying to manufacture forgettable people, as far as the broader public is concerned. And that mechanism, of rendering people forgettable, will also apply to the rest of us when we're the ones being offshored, because we've already been conditioned, in this society, to forget what happens to criminalized people when they're disappeared into the system.

Now, you've mentioned Trump's efforts to deport international students with ties to the Palestine solidarity movement. Of course, the Palestine solidarity movement has already been stigmatized, criminalized and positioned as inherently punishable, which we also saw under Biden. But this move to deport international students who have any affiliation with the movement really sits at the intersection of Trump's war on immigrants, the repression of Palestine advocacy, and Trump's broader attack on higher education.

It's obvious that reducing the number of non-white immigrants and terrorizing non-white immigrant communities is one of the core priorities of this administration. Support for Israel's genocide, and for Netanyahu, whose impunity is aspirational for Trump, is also embedded here. I also think it's important to observe how the stigmatization of student protesters, by both parties, is being exploited to treat solidarity with Palestinians as a political affiliation that is inherently worthy of deportation and criminalization — because we're going to see more of that, as protesters are increasingly characterized as “insurrectionists.” And then, there's this element of policing thought, and attacking institutions where ideas about liberation and oppression might be shared. 

As you've alluded to, some of the things that people are reacting to as being particularly shocking right now are things that have been happening for a while, but this policing of thought, the severity of that, and these attacks on cities and institutions where the administration feels their white supremacist values aren't being sufficiently upheld, this feels like a significant escalation. It feels like an effort to remake society, and the attacks on immigrants that we're seeing seem like an early stage of that larger project.

SS: I couldn't agree more. I really do think that the targeting of student activists is in this sort of Venn diagram of what this administration is trying to do. Like you say, this convergence, it's like immigrants are a target, Palestinians are of course a target, and people who support Palestine are a target, and these are the “enemy populations” of this administration, and then universities, because like you said, it's taking away the institutional basis for free thinking. It's an easy front to show that there isn't any room for dissent. And so, these particular institutions, universities become a site to do that. And the way they do that is by punishing people. So, whether it's through disappearing people, deportations, having all these institutions waste money on legal battles, taking away their money, taking away their possibility for research and other capacities, I think all of those things are strategies to go after universities, and then use this low-hanging fruit of Palestinians who fall into that Venn diagram are people who are international students who have supported Palestinian protests or protests in support of Palestine, this is… They're an easy target.

And I think in so many ways it's because they see it as an easy target, they sort of went after Mahmoud Khalil, and Rümeysa Öztürk, and all these other individuals. And Mahmoud Khalil is still being detained, because again, he's this sort of testing subject, how far can we go with this? And even now with how we're seeing some of these things evolve, like we were talking about detention as a testing ground or the offshoring… Like Kilmar Abrego García is finally coming back, but they're saying he is going to be charged with potentially harboring immigrants or facing criminal charges. And so, all of those things, they're taking these steps, and then how do they justify these steps and how do they hold onto them, and how far can they go, I think is the question. And how institutions are going to respond.

And so, from my perspective, I think one of the big challenges is how much people are really fearful of talking about Palestine, and at least I can say, obviously this has played out at particular universities, Columbia obviously. So, when you're looking at the nonprofit system, for instance, so many of our organizations depend on funding from foundations, and foundations are also a potential institution that will be targeted, [501C3] infrastructures are a potential institution that will be targeted. So, I think there's so much fear, and again, because there isn't a lot of political education sometimes about what's happening in Palestine, or the understanding of these conditions, or this has become this sort of tool by which to go after institutions, people are that much more scared. And so, I think in terms of how we respond and what I strongly believe is that it's so important that we see these struggles as interconnected. And I think on immigration and migrant justice and Palestine solidarity in particular, I think there's just this bigger question of the U.S. role in what's happening in Gaza, and the West Bank right now, and how we understand it, and us as people who are living in the U.S. and want to respond to that. But also Gaza has been a laboratory for a lot of the tactics and militarization that's being utilized at the U.S.-Mexico border. And also the reality is that the U.S. system of immigration, and the response to that is in large part because of U.S. foreign policy and the role that U.S. foreign policy has played in so many other parts of the world to lead to these levels of migration. It's not only U.S. foreign policy, but it plays such a significant role, of course, which we've seen over time because of U.S.-backed wars and efforts in Central America. But even now, this sort of villainization of Palestinians, you also see this villainization of Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio last year, we saw that and also of Venezuelans.

And I think there's this thing where it's like these are the “enemy populations” and is this the sort of evolution. Whereas before the focus was on the “rule of law” and it was sort of masquerading as the way to go after people. Now it's really evolved into what you're naming, which is essentially belief systems. Mahmoud Khalil was essentially targeted for a thought crime, and that is a major, major escalation. So it's important to understand that there's a huge system that's been built up over time that is being utilized and weaponized in all these different ways. But this escalation around Palestinian solidarity and targeting immigrants in particular around that, is such an important piece of why we need to be in solidarity, like migrant justice movements and Palestine solidarity movements need to be in solidarity with each other because these things are being utilized to go after our communities.

And yeah, I guess the thing I would say in terms of a response is that it's so important for us to make sure that in whatever way that we are working against the escalations right now, or how these things are moving is to have that sort of deeper political education and not fall into these innocence frames or other frames around this that might suggest that some of what ICE is doing is okay, or some of what this administration is doing is okay for certain people. And that instead we need to just be really clear that the way these institutions have been built up and the way that authoritarianism and rising fascism works is through law enforcement. And we have to make sure that we are fighting the system as a whole and not accept that some people are deserving or undeserving because of their interactions with the criminal legal system and whatnot.

And then also I think it's so important as the migrant justice movement to really have a political education about what is happening in Palestine right now, the history of that, the history of the U.S. involvement and those sort of broader connections and really understanding our movement as an internationalist movement, which I think is something that's really been lost over time. I think there have been moments when the migrant justice struggle, the immigrant rights struggle in the U.S. has really been much more internationalist like in the 1980s, for instance, during the Sanctuary movement and really understanding what was happening in Central America.

But I think in the last few decades that has really been lost. And I think this is the time to really fully embrace that, both because of the role that U.S. foreign policy plays broadly, why it's so important for us to call out what the U.S. is doing in terms of the destruction of Gaza and Palestine, but also as we're seeing the offshoring of detention and how different places are being … The fact that the Trump administration is trying to send people to South Sudan or to Ukraine, there's so much there I think about us needing to have a broader internationalist lens to the work we do to support migrant justice efforts.

KH: I really appreciate what you were saying about innocence narratives because we're seeing a lot of people lean into that approach right now — highlighting, for example, those with no criminal record or those who had legal status but were still harmed by the administration. And I know this can be tricky, because I do think it's important to correct false narratives and to tell the truth about people's stories, particularly in the face of fascist lies. But when we zoom in on particular people, and exceptionalize their cases, that's often done at the expense of other people, who are more or less written out of the story at that point. Winning becomes a matter of helping the most perfect victims, rather than stopping fascist and carceral violence. How do you think we should address these concerns and push for a more expansive vision of justice?

SS: Yeah, I mean, I think when Mahmoud Khalil was taken or when Kilmar Abrego García, when those sort of stories sort of blew up, I think it is absolutely justified and terrible and things that I don't think should be happening. And again, like I said, Khalil's being targeted for what is essentially a thought crime, and Kilmar Abrego García was just sort of swept up into this and those things are not okay. But I think the thing that people really, really leaned on is this idea of them being denied due process. It was a hard thing to hear as somebody who's been doing this work for a very long time.

I mean, Detention Watch Network was founded in 1997, which was the year after the passage of two really harsh draconian laws, which we sort of referred to as the 1996 immigration laws that actually expanded the scope of who would be denied due process, including green card holders and people who had visas and people who had … It wasn't just undocumented people, but it was like any non-citizen could be denied due process if they had had certain types of interactions with the criminal legal system or people who are newly arriving could be denied due process. And so those things expanded significantly then. And that was 30 years ago. It was a really long time ago.

And I think the thing that abolition and a deeper understanding of the prison-industrial complex teaches us is that when you accept that some people are deserving of incarceration or detention or deportation, the scope of who is eligible, the scope of who is deserving just keeps expanding. And so that's what we started to see. And so when it comes to the question around innocence frameworks and who's deserving and who's not deserving, I think again, there's this sort of thing where for so many years, their strategies of targeting people, and especially under the Obama years, they really perfected this was sort of masquerading as like, “Well, we're using the rule of law and the rule of law is the way that we go after people through the criminal legal system.” And it just ballooned the system. And there was no real perspective or understanding of the many, many years of the growth of the prison system in this country to more than 2 million people in prison by 2000 when in 1970 we had 300,000 people in prison.

And so I think that sort of historical understanding and political education about why we have the largest prison system in the world is often missing in this conversation and how that's expanded over time and really how Black, Indigenous, Brown people and working class and poor people are really the people who are caught up in the system. And so I think all those things are really an important part of this conversation. But when it comes to immigration specifically, I think there is a lie that's constantly being told to us that immigration is a public safety issue. And so people just accept that and people have completely accepted that as a frame. And so then the response is, “Well, this person isn't deserving because of this, or this person is relatively innocent in these ways.”

And what it does is it keeps reinforcing this idea that some people aren't deserving, that keeps reinforcing the idea of the good immigrant versus the bad immigrant. And what's happened is that this emphasis on the good immigrant versus bad immigrant, which under the Biden years was really the old immigrant versus the new immigrant, those things have been so embedded and reinforced that it gave the Trump administration and the right wing to basically take on this idea that all immigrants were bad. And similarly, they implemented what is known as the “Muslim ban” or the Muslim African ban, but even expanded beyond that, travel ban. And again, it's this idea that national security, which is again another lie that's always told to us, that immigration is about national security and public safety, they are now expanding that even more and more.

And it's when we accept these ideas about immigration as a public safety question, or immigration as a national security question that they have more fodder, they have more ability to use those narratives to go after more people. And so we have to disrupt that and say no. I mean, immigration is about family relationships, it's about seeking refuge, but it's about labor. And we have to have a bigger conversation about the political economy and the role of immigration in that. And like I was saying earlier about the sort of role of U.S. foreign policy. And so I think in terms of how do we navigate these concerns and push for a more expansive vision, I've said this, there was many, many years where under the Obama years where you saw the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and this sort of questioning of policing and mass incarceration and how those things have evolved.

And in many ways, I think the immigrant justice movement benefited so greatly from that period of time because it gave us the sort of understanding of the criminal legal system and the sort of connections to make and the work to actually expand sanctuary policy, which isn't perfect by any means. But it did actually help reduce deportations. And so that bigger racial reckoning and all these bigger questions actually gave us room to push back against the criminal legal system and its role in immigration. I think now we are seeing the use of the criminal legal system, the use of different levels of law enforcement, the FBI, et cetera, to go after immigrants. And I think it's a time where we need to make sure that our fight for immigrant justice is doing that deeper work to say, this is only possible because fascism and authoritarianism are deployed through law enforcement. And this is only possible because we have one of the largest prison systems in the world and this really robust system of policing that's been increasingly militarized.

So we need to make sure that we both … Yes, I absolutely believe that ICE should be abolished, but if we stop at ICE, we're sort of missing the bigger picture and we don't actually kind of get to the core of the problem with the system as a whole. And so from my perspective, I worry that if we lean into these due process narratives or these innocence frameworks, that it just lends itself to actually a lot of what happened during Trump's first term, which is it didn't actually do the deeper work that we need to do. And so I hope that we learn some lessons this time and try to really do the work to not … This heightened focus on immigration and immigration enforcement right now is an opportunity to sort of go deeper and do that political education so that once we have the opportunity, we can push back against the whole system.

KH: What you're naming about law enforcement as a mechanism of authoritarian control really resonates. It's something we have to keep lifting up, especially with so many people fetishizing “the rule of law” as a knee jerk response to Trumpism. 

I also want to emphasize, while we're on the subject of innocence frameworks, that this applies to protest as well. When protesters are accused of “violence”… as I said, we need to correct misinformation, where it exists. If people are accused of things they did not do, the truth should be told. And at the same time, the good protester/bad protester divide has got to go. We cannot deploy logics that position people resisting fascism as being responsible for fascist violence —  logics that deem protesters disposable because something got broken or spray-painted, or because someone defended themselves or their community.

I've seen people on social media saying that if protesters don't remain peaceful — which is an elastic term that police, politicians and the media can strip away no matter what you do — Trump will escalate. As some of us who have attended a lot of protests know, they will call us violent whenever it suits them to do so. Governments have described rescuing migrants at sea as “trafficking,” for fuck's sake. They've called poetry “violence.” I can't tell you how many times I've been at a protest where a cop brutalized a person, and then charged them with assault to lend themselves cover. That story will be manufactured if they want to manufacture it. They will lie, and they will use infiltrators, if need be, and they will craft their narrative. I need everyone to be serious. We cannot control how they characterize us.What is within our control is whether or not we do their work for them by casting blame on the same people they scapegoat. We can choose not to depict people engaged in civil resistance to fascism as being responsible for fascist violence, just as we can refuse to suggest or accept that any immigrant who has been sent to CECOT deserves to be there, with or without a criminal record. When we are talking about fascist violence, we blame fascists. And we should seek to interrupt that violence. Criminalization — which includes the criminalization of immigrants — is the primary mechanism of violence at their disposal. So to play into carceral narratives of innocence and guilt, and who is worthy or disposable, among people resisting, and among people who are trying to survive is wholly unacceptable. 

Above all, let's not do their work for them. Let's not be so psychologically captured that we join them in blaming or disposing of their scapegoats.

SS: I think that's really well said. And I think, like I said, there is this way that the broader obsession with public safety, and the rule of law, and national security, and all these things just lend itself to more and more people being put into a category of, what they did was wrong and they are deserving of this, versus the person who is not deserving. And it actually doesn't help any of us.

KH: I would love to pivot to what can and does help us. So, if folks are listening, and they're angry, frightened, or upset about what's happening right now, what kind of organizing should they engage with in this moment? 

SS: I think it's a hard question right now, how to prioritize. I'll be really honest. I do think that there are so many fronts. I have been so incredibly inspired by the communities that have been coming out in support of immigrants locally across the country. And I think, again, and we learned this during the first Trump administration, this is a moment to really go local. What is happening in your community? What can you do to support immigrants in your community or people who are being targeted for whatever reason in your community? And making sure that there's infrastructure and support set up. There's a lot of tools and resources out there, from Siembra, for instance, in North Carolina, which I know you interviewed them, Kelly. They have a Defend and Recruit resource that I think is really helpful to local communities who are trying to fight back and figure out what they can do to prevent people being put into ICE custody.

I also think that the big piece for Detention Watch Network and our work is really stopping this infrastructure from being built up. It's so much easier to build up these systems than to take them down. And so I think it's really, really important right now for us to think about the ways that we can block expansion. Across the country we're seeing not just new facilities or new contracts happening, but also existing facilities being expanded, potential use of military bases, them using different types of facilities. So I think it's a time of getting as much information as we can about the expansion that's happening and paying attention to that and demanding of elected leaders at every level of government. So whether it's your city council or your county commissioner that do have actually a lot of say of what happens in their community, if ICE is going to be using a county jail, or potentially putting in a new facility, or using a nearby military base. All of those things are so important and it's so important that we're doing the work to make sure people are educated.

I also think, I know it feels sometimes really disheartening to try to influence what's happening with the federal budget, but I really do believe if this budget bill passes, it could mean over the next four years, $45 billion going to expanding the system. And, again, we're going to do everything we can to stop that, but it's so important that members of Congress know what is happening, what this will mean, how much damage this could do. Again, detention is one of the drivers and key facilitators of deportation. So doing everything we can to stop the system, both because they're horrendous conditions, it's incredibly dehumanizing, and more and more people are dying in detention and there's really scary things happening. We don't want people to go into the detention system, but also if they have more detention capacity, they're going to be able to deport more people.

And so I think those pieces, from my perspective, finding in your local community what's happening, how are people fighting back against ICE raids? How are people doing work to understanding how detention is working in their community? We have a lot of political education we've been doing on the use of federal prisons, for instance, or the use of military bases, and trying to understand that history. And this is like a long-haul fight. I do think that it's going to be hard. And I know it can be very disheartening to feel like, “Oh, we tried to stop this, but it didn't work.” But I said this earlier, working on this issue for so many years, there were many years where we led campaigns and lost. And the question is, how do you lose in a way that you get to a win eventually?

And so this is the time to bring people in, do that political education, make sure we're going deeper on these questions around these carceral systems, around these sort of narratives around public safety and national security, and not buying into that, and doing the work to educate people and making sure we move beyond that so that we can be prepared when there are openings, be prepared to fight back and offer a different path, a different vision. I think that is what we need to be doing right now. And I've just been so blown away and encouraged by how much we're already seeing that with the protests in LA, for instance, or across the country. And yeah, I think people say this a lot, there's opportunity in crisis, and I think in this moment there's a real opportunity for us to dig deeper on the problems with immigration enforcement and the prison-industrial complex and the way that it's built up in existence over decades now has led us to this point.

KH: I deeply appreciate those insights. And I also just want to encourage folks to be sure that we're not framing our efforts as an attempt to return to the status quo. As you've been alluding to throughout this conversation, Democrats played a big role in paving the path to this moment. And as much as we talk about the right fantasizing about a return to a sort of mythologized past, we need to make sure that our side isn't mythologizing the past either. When we emphasize the nightmarish nature of this moment, we cannot erase the role the Clinton, Obama or Biden administrations played in delivering us to this moment. 

SS: Well, a lot of people say they are grateful to have my book, Unbuild Walls, as a resource right now. And so much of what I write about in Unbuild Walls is how the Democrats helped us get here and how much the Democrats… I think these particular narratives around the good immigrant versus the bad immigrant, the old immigrant versus the new immigrant, the leaning into criminalization, especially by the Obama administration and giving fodder to the Republicans during that period of time, opened up space for this. And I think similarly with the Biden administration and then Kamala Harris's campaign last year, I mean, she was running as more hardline than Trump, and just opening up space for… I do really strongly believe that a lot of the way that campaign was run and a lot of the moves that they were making in the last couple years gave much more… I think those moves actually really created the conditions to get us to this place.

And one of the things that happened even before Trump came in office just… And the first bill that Trump signed [during his current term] was the Laken Riley Act, which was, again, this tale as old as time when it comes to the criminal system in the U.S., where you have a sort of moral panic, a crime panic around one very specific tragedy to exploit. And then what they ended up doing was expanding mandatory detention significantly, the most it's been expanded in 30 years, where they denied due process to even more immigrants. And the Democrats supported that. Many Democrats supported that. And so I think it's really important that we… I think, like you're saying, there is this perception of, “Oh, it was so great a year ago.” No, it wasn't so great. In fact, a lot of the moves that Biden was making around the border, and capitulating to Republicans and accepting their frame, set us up for this moment, because it did the work to dehumanize immigrants.

There's always this perception in immigrant rights work where… And this goes back to the push for comprehensive immigration reform, which tried to get legalization for large numbers of immigrants, some 11 million immigrants, and so trying to get legalization. But the whole strategy is, “We're going to get legalization, but actually we're going to have more criminal bars, more border militarization.” And what those things did was dehumanize immigrants more. So they're trying to pass affirmative relief for large categories of immigrants while at the same time dehumanizing immigrants. And it doesn't really work that way, because then it made it that much harder for them to do the good things for immigrants.

And so this is what we've seen time and time again with the Democrats. And many years of this have turned into the Trump administration and the right just saying all immigrants are a problem. And that is why it's so, so essential that we don't fall back into these innocence narratives and these carceral framings around immigration or this lie about public safety and national security. We really, really have to break from that, because that's the only way we're going to get to a place where we will have immigrant justice, where we will have migrant justice and racial justice.

KH: Absolutely. Well, I want to thank you so much for all of your insights, Silky. This has been such a valuable conversation, and I always learned so much from you. So, thank you for making the time, amid everything that's happening, to have this conversation today. I'm sure our listeners appreciate it.

SS: Thank you so much for having me. I'm just so grateful for the offerings that you've had, that Truthout has had, that in this moment. I think we so desperately need to be clear about the conditions that we're in and how we're responding so that we can strategize better. And I feel that “Movement Memos” and a lot of what you're sharing has been really essential to that.

KH: Thank you, that means so much, especially coming from you. I look forward to talking again soon.

SS: Yeah, me too. Thank you.

[musical interlude]

KH: I am so grateful for Silky's work and wisdom. Before we close out this episode, I also want to take a moment to extend some love and solidarity to a group of organizers in my own community. Organized Communities Against Deportations is a beloved and essential force in the city of Chicago. Last week, when ICE seized 10 people in Chicago's South Loop, one of those taken was Gladis Yolanda Chavez Pineda — a longtime OCAD organizer. Gladis was arrested after showing up for an immigration check-in. In a petition for Gladis' release, OCAD stated:

Gladis has been living in the U.S. for over 10 years while actively pursuing asylum … [She] is a devoted mother and grandmother who works in construction and spends her time supporting others through her leadership in Organized Communities Against Deportations (OCAD). She has mentored countless members and continues to be a source of strength and care. Detaining Gladis is unnecessary, harmful, and inhumane.

If you would like to join OCAD and the Chicago organizing community in demanding the immediate release of our friend and co-struggler, you can find OCAD's petition linked in the show notes of this episode. 

I know these are upsetting, disorienting, and discouraging times. I want to say that what we have is each other, but honestly, that's a decision we have to make. We have to decide whether to support each other, whether to reach for each other, and whether or not we will reject the stigmas and scapegoating that would divide us. We can rage against the culture of forgetting that this administration is expanding. We can refuse to forget our stolen neighbors, and reject our own potential erasure. If we make the right choice, we will still face a great deal of tumult and loss, but we will also find comfort in solidarity and reciprocal care. For now, I want to send my love to everyone who is organizing community defense, protesting, and doing the work of collective survival. Your efforts are the stuff that hope's made of, so please, keep reaching out, keep building, and never give up on each other.

I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today. And remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I'll see you in the streets.

The 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops ordered to Los Angeles by President Donald Trump in response to protests over immigration enforcement operations lack the authority to arrest protesters but may temporarily detain them if necessary, an Army general said on Wednesday.

Telus offices in Ottawa. The company is proposing to buy back its affiliate, Telus Digital.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press

Telus Inc. T-T is proposing a more than US$400-million deal to take back control of its affiliate, Telus Digital TIXT-T, which has seen its share price plummet since it went public, locking in major losses as the company considers future spinout plans.

Telus has signed a non-binding indication of interest to acquire all outstanding shares of Telus Digital, which offers technology outsourcing, for US$3.40 for multiple and subordinate shares, the company said in a release Thursday morning. 

Shares of Telus Digital on the New York Stock Exchange were up 26 per cent in morning trading, to US$3.73. The parent company's shares rose 0.7 per cent.

Telus Digital's share price debuted at US$25 following its initial public offer in 2021, but has since declined by more than 90 per cent following industry-wide pressures on customer service businesses and the loss of major clients such as Meta Inc.

The stock was trading at US$2.96 on the New York Stock Exchange before markets opened. The offer represents a 15-per-cent premium to the share price before markets Thursday, and a 23-per-cent premium over the company's 30-day volume-weighted average trading price. 

The proposed acquisition represents a new cost for Telus, as it aims to pay down its nearly $25-billion in long-term debt, and looks to capitalize on its other business lines. Telus is proposing to pay cash, shares or a combination of both for the multiple and subordinate shares.

The company said that reacquiring its former spinout would allow it to accelerate its artificial intelligence and software capabilities across all its business lines.

In a note to investors, Bank of Nova Scotia analyst Maher Yaghi called Telus's bid “the logical thing to do.”

“We believe Telus is serious about this offer. It is possible a sweetener could be required to get this over the finish line, but we also have many investors in TIXT that would likely be happy to move on and see positively, the immediate benefit of a quick liquidity event,” Mr. Yaghi said. 

Mr. Yagi said the price offered, if accepted, will require Telus to disburse around $550-million to acquire minority shareholders. However, Telus Digital still owes its parent company cash, meaning that Telus's net disbursements could be half of that amount after netting out the debt.

The company said that any financing that it undertakes in the near term will be designed to be neutral to its balance sheet net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, as it maintains focus on deleveraging.

Richard Tse, analyst for the National Bank of Canada, said the deal values Telus Digital at about US$2.3-billion, calling that a reasonable valuation when compared to peers.

Tyler Tebbs, head of research company Tebbs Capital, said that the proposal likely leaves Telus ahead financially, given that it raised over a billion dollars during the 2021 IPO, offloaded some financial risk and is now buying back the company at a steep discount. 

While it leaves Telus's reputation among investors with “a little bit of a black eye,” he said, the onus should be on shareholders who bought in at high prices to understand the risks inherent to the customer experience sector.

“It was no secret that the space was facing all sorts of disruption,” he said.

The public listing of Telus Digital was celebrated as the first step in chief executive officer Darren Entwistle's ambitions to spin off two other business lines, Telus Health and Telus Agriculture and Consumer Goods. 

Some analysts have previously said that Telus Digital's poor stock performance could have a dampening effect on investor appetite for the possible monetization of those assets, which Telus has said could come in the form of either the addition of a strategic partner or a public listing.

Mr. Tebbs said that while investors will assess these other divisions on their own merits, investors would likely “do more homework.”

Meanwhile, Mr. Yaghi saw the proposal as a positive step ahead of any such monetization.

“While it is too early to know if this deal will go through or not, putting this whole issue with TIXT behind it would be a good thing for TELUS as it gears towards a possible liquidity event for its Healthcare business possibly in 2026-2027,” he said.

Telus currently holds about 57 per cent of Telus Digital shares, and has asked Telus Digital's board to form a committee of independent directors to evaluate the proposal. 

Barclays is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Telus, and Stikeman Elliott LLP and A&O Shearman are acting as legal advisors.

More than 20 technology companies went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange during the pandemic in an IPO boom, including Telus Digital. But of those, half have since been taken private again, often at below-IPO prices, and many of the other half have considered doing so.

More than 290 people were killed when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed minutes after taking off from the western city of Ahmedabad on Thursday, authorities said, in the world's worst aviation disaster in a decade.

The dead included people on the ground as the aircraft – headed for Gatwick Airport, south of the British capital – crashed on to a medical college hostel during lunch hour.

At least one passenger is known to have survived, police said, and the man told Indian media how he had heard a loud noise shortly after take-off.

“Approximately 294 have died. This includes some students as the plane crashed on the building where they were staying,” Vidhi Chaudhary, a top state police officer, told Reuters.

She said police found one survivor who was in seat 11A, next to an emergency exit, adding that there could be more survivors in hospital.

“Thirty seconds after take-off, there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed,” 40-year-old Ramesh Viswashkumar told the Hindustan Times, which showed a boarding pass for seat 11A in that name online.

“It all happened so quickly,” he told the paper from his hospital bed.

“When I got up, there were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me,” he said. “Someone grabbed hold of me and put me in an ambulance and brought me to the hospital.”

He said that his brother Ajay was seated in a different row on the plane. “He was travelling with me and I can't find him any more. Please help me find him,” he said.

An Air India passenger plane with over 240 people onboard has crashed Thursday in India's northwestern city of Ahmedabad, according to the airline and local media.

Ahmedabad police chief G.S. Malik said the bodies recovered could include both passengers and people killed on the ground. The dead included Vijay Rupani, the former chief minister of Gujarat state, of which Ahmedabad is the main city.

Relatives had been asked to give DNA samples to identify the dead, state health secretary Dhananjay Dwivedi told reporters.

Parts of the plane's body were scattered around the building into which it crashed, photographs and videos from the area showed. The tail of the plane was stuck on top of the building.

The passengers included 217 adults, 11 children and two infants a source told Reuters. Of them, 169 were Indian nationals, 53 were Britons, seven Portuguese, and one Canadian, Air India said.

Aviation tracking site Flightradar24 said the plane was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, one of the most modern passenger aircraft in service.

It was the first crash for the Dreamliner, which began flying commercially in 2011, according to the Aviation Safety Network database. The plane that crashed on Thursday flew for the first time in 2013 and was delivered to Air India in January, 2014, Flightradar24 said.

Thursday's crash occurred just after the plane took off. TV channels showed the plane taking off over a residential area and then disappearing from the screen before a huge fireball could be seen rising into the sky from beyond the houses.

“My sister-in-law was going to London. Within an hour, I got news that the plane had crashed,” Poonam Patel, a relative of one of the passengers, told news agency ANI at the government hospital in Ahmedabad.

The crash of an Air India plane in Ahmedabad on Thursday set buildings on fire and left its tail section wedged into a structure. More than 200 people were killed when the plane heading to London crashed after taking off.

The Globe and Mail

Ramila, the mother of a student at the medical college, told ANI her son had gone to the hostel for his lunch break when the plane crashed. “My son is safe, and I have spoken to him. He jumped from the second floor, so he suffered some injuries,” she said.

According to air traffic control at Ahmedabad Airport, the aircraft departed at 1:39 p.m. (3:39 a.m. ET) from Runway 23. It gave a “Mayday” call, signalling an emergency, but thereafter there was no response from the aircraft.

U.S. aerospace safety consultant Anthony Brickhouse said one problematic sign from videos of the aircraft was that the landing gear was down at a phase of flight when it would typically be up.

“If you didn't know what was happening, you would think that plane was on approach to a runway,” Brickhouse said.

Boeing said it was in contact with Air India and working to gather more information. Boeing shares fell 5 per cent as the crash posed a major setback for the planemaker as its new CEO looks to rebuild trust following a series of safety and production challenges.

Aircraft engine-maker GE Aerospace said that it would put a team together to go to India and analyze cockpit data, India's CNBC TV18 reported.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it would lead a team of U.S. investigators travelling to India to help in the investigation.

Britain was working with Indian authorities to urgently establish the facts around the crash and to provide support to those involved, the country's foreign office said.

“The tragedy in Ahmedabad has stunned and saddened us,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X. “It is heartbreaking beyond words.”

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said images emerging of the crash were “devastating,” and that he was being kept informed as the situation developed. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said King Charles was also being kept updated.

Ahmedabad Airport, which suspended all flight operations after the crash, said it was operational again but with limited flights. The airport is operated by India's Adani Group conglomerate.

The last fatal plane crash in India, the world's third largest aviation market and its fastest growing, was in 2020 and involved Air India Express, the airline's low-cost arm.

The airline's Boeing-737 overshot a “table-top” runway in southern India, skidded and plunged into a valley, crashing nose-first into the ground and killing 21 people.

			Karen Bass is accused of ‘creating chaos' in her handling of the LA riots

A few months ago, Karen Bass was accused of standing by as Los Angeles burned.

Now, the city's mayor has been accused of “fanning the flames” – but this time of the rioting, violence and looting that has consumed its downtown area.

Critics say Ms Bass has provoked clashes between law enforcement and protesters, who have been demonstrating against raids by immigration authorities since Friday, and is in denial about the scale of the crisis that has gripped the City of Angels.

A constant presence on Left-leaning CNN and MSNBC this week, she has routinely downplayed the violent scenes even as cars have been torched and journalists have been injured by non-lethal rounds.

When immigration officials raided workplaces in downtown Los Angeles on Friday, Ms Bass declared herself “deeply angered” and hit out at what she claimed was an attempt to “sow terror in our communities”.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, later claimed the mayor had “embarked on one of the most outrageous campaigns of lies this country has ever seen from an elected official, blaming President Trump and brave law enforcement officers for the violence”.

Critics say Ms Bass's words inflamed the tensions between immigration officials and demonstrators, provoking riots that have lasted for days.

“Karen Bass whipped all of this up,” Ric Grenell, Donald Trump's presidential envoy for special missions, wrote on social media.

“She attacked the rule of law. She undermined democracy. The mayor of LA is creating chaos in LA.”

This week, she issued a statement downplaying the scale of the violence, even as several journalists caught up in the ensuing melee were shot by police using non-lethal rounds, including The Telegraph's Jon Putman.

Mr Putman, who was struck in the ear, narrowly avoided serious injury, but said a clean shot would have put him “out of commission”.

Nick Stern, a British news photographer, was shot in the leg with a non-lethal round on Saturday, and when a paramedic cut off his clothes found a “five centimetre hole with muscle hanging out of it”.

If Ms Bass is an effective rabble rouser as her critics claim, then the evidence shows she is less adept at cooling tensions.

Over the weekend, she called on rioters to stop looting businesses in downtown Los Angeles, but the dozens of masked figures who raided the CVS, Adidas and T-Mobile shops among others seem to have been unmoved.

Finally, with crime spiralling out of control, Ms Bass decided to act on Monday.

“We reached a tipping point,” she said at a news conference, announcing a curfew between 8pm and 6am local time after more than two dozen businesses were vandalised. Others might have reached the same conclusion days ago.

At that point, she conceded the “vandalism and violence” had been “significant”, long after images of burned-out cars and masked protesters had made their way around the world.

Moses Castillo, a former LAPD detective who responded to the Rodney King riots that gripped Los Angeles in the early 1990s, criticised Ms Bass for being too slow and indecisive.

“I think she's trying to play catch up,” he told Fox News.

“I think if she had been very forceful in the beginning that we're not going to tolerate these crimes and allow police officers to do their job and arrest people on sight, I think it would have been different.

“She's now saying that these crimes will not be tolerated, looting will not be tolerated, but it's a little bit too late.”

To Ms Bass's political enemies – and there are many, including within her own party – these are familiar themes from the Los Angeles mayor's playbook.

When the city found itself in the grip of devastating wildfires back in January, she fumbled her public statements, rowed with officials, and belatedly tried to get a grip on the crisis.

Ms Bass wasn't in Los Angeles when the fires broke out. She wasn't even in California, or the US.

She was in Ghana to attend the inauguration of its president, and hours after the Pacific Palisades blaze started she was posing for photographs at a reception organised by the US ambassador.

The trip was a “mistake”, she later conceded, adding: “I hated the fact that I was out of the city when the city needed me the most.”

When she did return, Kristin Crowley, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) chief blamed her for slashing their budget, leaving her colleagues defenceless when the fires broke out.

By the time the smoke cleared, the wildfires had consumed some 16,000 buildings, forced 200,000 people to evacuate, and killed 30.

But for some ill-judged comments about Cuba's Communist regime, it's possible that Los Angeles could have been spared the worst of these crises.

Joe Biden, the former US president, briefly considered Ms Bass as a potential running mate for the 2020 election, before she won the mayoral election two years later.

But it subsequently emerged that Ms Bass had visited Communist Cuba several times as a young woman in the 1970s, and when Fidel Castro died in 2016 after ruling the country for decades, she lamented “a great loss to the people of Cuba”.

That was enough to end the prospect of any role in the Biden campaign. Ms Bass's loss, as it turned out, was Los Angeles' loss too.

Beach Boys members Al Jardine and Mike Love give lengthy tributes to late songwriter, with Jardine calling him a ‘humble musical giant'

 Brian Wilson: a life in pictures

 Twelve of Brian Wilson's greatest songs

Following his death aged 82, Brian Wilson's Beach Boys bandmates have been among those paying tribute to one of the great figures in American popular music.

Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Al Jardine described Wilson as “a real gentleman, a real musical intellect, who taught the world how to smile.”

Jardine added: “He was a humble musical giant … he didn't want attention, was only interested in making the best possible music.”

He described the band's early days, saying that he along with the Wilson brothers and their cousin Mike Love “became one big happy family. We started in a very humble way, singing about domestic things like surfing and cars and girls. The more successful we became, he grew exponentially with each album. He learned to write creatively, and taught us with that same energy how to interpret it. He knew how to get the best out of us. He was a good teacher, a great mentor, and arranger, producer – he was the whole package.”

Mike Love wrote his own tribute, saying: “Today, the world lost a genius, and I lost a cousin by blood and my partner in music. Brian Wilson wasn't just the heart of the Beach Boys – he was the soul of our sound. From the first time we sang together as kids in my living room, I knew there was something otherworldly in him. His musical gifts were unmatched. The melodies he dreamed up, the emotions he poured into every note – Brian changed the course of music for ever.”

He acknowledged the “ups and downs” in their relationship – he sued Wilson numerous times, and won an out of court settlement after claiming Wilson defamed him in his 1991 memoir. But, he added, “we never stopped loving each other, and I never stopped being in awe of what he could do when he sat at a piano, or his spontaneity in the studio.”

Wilson's daughter Carnie wrote: “My father was every fibre of my body. He will be remembered by millions and millions until the world ends. I am lucky to have been his daughter and had a soul connection with him that will live on always. I've never felt this kind of pain before, but I know he's resting up there in heaven.”

Bob Dylan said he had “thought about all the years I've been listening to him and admiring his genius”, Carole King heralded a “friend and brother in songwriting”, while Mick Fleetwood, bandleader with Fleetwood Mac, wrote: “Anyone with a musical bone in their body must be grateful for Brian Wilson's genius magical touch!! And greatly saddened of this major worldly loss!!” Musician and film-maker Questlove said that “if there was a human being who made art out of inexpressible sadness … damn it was Brian Wilson”.

Elton John remembered the collaborations he made with Wilson, who provided vocal harmonies on John's 2010 album with Leon Russell, The Union. “I grew to love him as a person, and for me, he was the biggest influence on my songwriting ever,” John wrote. “He was a musical genius and revolutionary. He changed the goalposts when it came to writing songs and shaped music for ever. A true giant.”

The tributes follow one made on the official Beach Boys social media channels, which read in part: “The melodies he dreamed up and the emotions he poured into every note changed the course of music for ever.”

NEW YORK/GENEVA — The United Nations is considering reorganizing more than 40 agencies, organizations andcutting about 7,000 jobs, including U.N. Secretariat positions, it has been learned.

The U.N. was forced to make an unprecedented large-scale reorganization as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration turning its back on international cooperation and cutting funding for the international body.

The U.N. will eliminate some operations that overlap and reorganize regional offices, particularly in such areas as peacekeeping and development assistance, according to internal documents obtained by The Yomiuri Shimbun and other sources.

After Trump's inauguration in January, there has been pressure to accelerate the process of reviewing organizations and cutting budgets, according to U.N. sources.

According to the documents, there is a proposal to merge the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration and other agencies into a single new agency dealing with humanitarian responses and protections. Another is to merge the U.N. Women and the U.N. Population Fund to create an agency responsible for women and health.

The documents also propose to abolish the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and have it be absorbed into the World Health Organization.

Regarding staff, the documents state that the U.N. is considering cutting about 20% of the about 39,000 jobs, including Secretariat employees at the U.N. headquarters who assist with policy and handle administrative tasks. The cuts will be gradually carried out by not filling posts and by not renewing contracts for short-term staff.

The U.N. also plans to relocate staff from cities with higher costs, such as New York and Geneva to Kenya and other countries, according to the documents.

The U.N. expects to cut costs by about $740 million (about ¥110 billion) through these changes, which need to be approved by member states.

The WHO, which took the lead in streamlining operations, has been forced to close medical facilities and suspend emergency medical services in some areas. There are fears that humanitarian assistance operations will be stalled in other agencies as well.

As the elimination of senior positions will impact interests of individual countries, it will likely lead to backlash from some member states. Twists and turns are anticipated before the reforms are realized.

The U.N. regular budget for the year is about $3.7 billion. The United States, which is the largest contributor, has so far contributed about $740 million per year.

However, the United States has not provided about $1.5 billion, including this year's funding, worsening the U.N.'s financial situation.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius arrived in Kyiv on June 12 to meet Ukrainian leaders and discuss future defense support for Ukraine, DPA news agency reported.

"We are doing everything we can to support Ukraine so that it can defend itself and get into a position where Russia is prepared to enter into serious negotiations," Pistorius said ahead of the departure, according to Reuters.

The visit marks Pistorius's first official trip to Ukraine as a minister in Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new German government. 

During former Chancellor Olaf Scholz's tenure, Defense Minister Pistorius made several visits to the war-torn country and played a key role in establishing Germany as Ukraine's top European military donor.

Amid President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to Berlin on May 28, Pistorius and his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, signed an agreement allocating 5 billion euros ($5.76 billion) in military support to Ukraine.

Under the deal, Berlin agreed to help fund the production of long-range drones in Ukraine, tapping into the country's existing industrial capacities and technical expertise.

Berlin also reaffirmed its commitment to supply Ukraine with critical ammunition and weapons. The arms heading Kyiv's way include air defense systems, artillery, land weapons systems, and handguns.

Taurus cruise missiles, a much-coveted long-range weapon capable of striking targets 500 kilometers (300 miles) away, were not announced as part of the package.

Merz has pledged to maintain Germany's steadfast support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. Berlin's role is even more crucial now as the U.S. Trump administration signaled its intent to cut down military assistance for Kyiv.

Since the outbreak of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Germany has provided Ukraine with almost 44 billion euros (around $50 billion) in various forms of support, the German government said.


          We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.

When Israel began to normalize relations with some of its neighbors in 2020, as part of the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, many analysts began to wonder whether the Palestinian cause still mattered to the Arab world. Doubts about the salience of the issue for Arabs grew in late 2023, when it appeared that Saudi Arabia might also join the accords, normalizing relations with Israel without demanding, in exchange, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

The Israeli military campaign in Gaza that followed Hamas's attack against Israel on October 7, 2023, provoked international outrage at the scale of violence used against Palestinian civilians and Israel's blockade of humanitarian assistance to Gaza. Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, and Israel have long endured violence and deprivation, but Arab opposition to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories has rarely been a decisive factor in the conflict. Considering the unprecedented level of devastation this round of fighting has wreaked, many observers anticipated that anger among ordinary citizens in Arab states might lead to significant shifts in their governments' rhetoric and policy.

Instead, some scholars have argued that the October 7 attacks and the events that followed have in fact weakened the Palestinian cause, noting that the issue has largely fallen off the international agenda. Some cite, for example, the fact that none of the Arab countries that signed peace treaties with Israel have broken those relations. Similarly, during U.S. President Donald Trump's recent trip to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, the issue took a back seat, at least publicly, overshadowed by the parties' economic interests. To some observers, popular outrage in the Arab world over the war seemed like a proverbial “dog that did not bark.”

This view, however, misses a crucial reality. As our opinion polling in the region demonstrates, Arab public opinion has indeed shifted—and in ways that have influenced the conduct of regimes in Arab countries. Although their core interests have not meaningfully changed as a result of the conflict in Gaza, their foreign policies have been constrained by their citizens' intensifying anger about Israeli offensives. After Israel began its campaign in Gaza, Arab-Israeli normalization was brought to a halt. And during Trump's recent visit to Saudi Arabia, the expansion of the Abraham Accords was not on the agenda. Despite October 7 and the Gaza war, some Arab governments still hoped for closer ties with Israel, believing such relations would serve their strategic interests. But they have not been able to move forward because of public opposition. The lack of progress on that agenda is the true “dog that did not bark.”

Today, unlike in the days before October 7, regional leaders cannot simply ignore their populations' support for the Palestinian cause. If Israel is to make meaningful progress on its integration into the region, some path to Palestinian statehood will have to be on the table.

Ordinary citizens in the Middle East and North Africa have long supported Palestinian statehood. And in the nine months that followed the beginning of the Israeli campaign, that commitment deepened. During that period, our organization, Arab Barometer, conducted nationally representative surveys across the region. We found that from Morocco to Kuwait, a clear majority of survey respondents described Israel's assault on Gaza using the terms “genocide,” “massacre,” or “ethnic cleansing.” Still, most respondents recognized Israel's right to exist: even after Israel responded with military force to the October 7 attacks, a majority in nearly all the countries surveyed favored a two-state solution for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But hostility toward Israel remained prevalent: just three percent of Tunisians, for example, reported holding a “very favorable” or “somewhat favorable” opinion of Israel. Support for normalization with Israel also fell, including in countries that had already signed the Abraham Accords. In Morocco, which normalized relations with Israel through the accords in 2020, just 13 percent of respondents favored the normalization of relations between Arab states and Israel in the months after October 7, compared with 31 percent in 2022.



Arab citizens' opinions of international actors have also shifted as a result of the war in Gaza. In most countries surveyed across the region, people reported substantially lower favorability toward the United States in the surveys conducted after October 7, compared with those conducted from 2021 to 2022, including declines of 23 percentage points in Jordan, 19 points in Mauritania, 15 points in Lebanon, and seven points in Iraq. Similar drops have occurred with respect to other Israeli allies, such as France and the United Kingdom. Favorability toward France dropped 20 percentage points in Lebanon, 17 points in Mauritania, and ten points in Morocco. The same was true of positive views toward the United Kingdom, which declined by 38 percentage points in Morocco, 11 points in Jordan, and five points in Iraq. Meanwhile, during the same period, views of China improved dramatically, reversing a years-long decline. China's favorability increased by 16 percentage points in Jordan, 15 points in Morocco, ten points in Iraq, and six points in Lebanon.

These dramatic changes in public opinion have not been accompanied by upheavals of the kind the region witnessed, for example, during the Arab Spring revolts of 2010–11. But protests have been relatively common across the Arab region over the past year and a half. In Arab Barometer surveys conducted from 2023 to 2024, at least ten percent of adult respondents in every country surveyed reported having taken part in a demonstration in the past year—a proportion comparable to that of adult Americans who took part in protests against police brutality during the spring and summer of 2020, according to polls conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Civis Analytics. As recently as April and May of this year, local protests related to Gaza have taken place in Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen. In Morocco, there were 110 demonstrations across 66 cities and towns in just a single day in April. And this week, a large grassroots convoy known as the Somoud and made up of Tunisians, Libyans, and individuals from a variety of other countries reached Libya, from its starting point in Tunis, on a mission to deliver aid to those in Gaza. The convoy expects to gain participants as it continues on toward Gaza. These events, however, have received relatively little attention from international media outlets.

Demonstrations would likely have been larger and involved broader segments of Arab societies—and more visible to outside observers—if not for the repressive practices of the governments in the region. Protests are not officially banned in most Arab countries, but most citizens understand that in practice, they do not have a guaranteed right to participate in demonstrations that express opposition to their governments' policies. Across 11 countries surveyed by Arab Barometer between 2021 and 2022, only 36 percent of respondents on average agreed that freedom to participate in peaceful protests and demonstrations is guaranteed to a “great or medium extent.” Tunisia was the only country where a clear majority of respondents—61 percent—agreed; only 25 percent of respondents in Jordan and 12 percent in Egypt answered the same. In the years since those polls were conducted, governments in the region have given people little reason to think they have become more open to dissent.



In Jordan, which has a peace treaty with Israel, protests against the Israeli campaign in Gaza began taking place nearly every day after October 7, with large-scale demonstrations following Friday prayers every week. After similar protests broke out around the Israeli embassy in Amman, Israel evacuated its ambassador, and it has not since replaced its diplomatic mission in Jordan. In November 2023, the Jordanian government recalled its own ambassador to Israel in response to public pressure. Jordan has, in some cases, continued its engagement with Israel. In response to Iran's missile and drone attack on Israel in April 2024, for example, Jordan quietly assisted the U.S.-led defense of Israel. This support led to large public protests in Jordan, and in April of this year, the Jordanian government began to enforce a ban on the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group with a long history of organizing demonstrations against Israel and in support of the Palestinian cause—and disbanded the organization. As a result of the crackdown, during the past two months, regular protests in support of Gaza have become far less common.

In Morocco, too, the regime has been wary of those who criticize the country's ties with Israel, which were formalized in 2020 as part of the Abraham Accords. The government has routinely jailed protesters demanding that Morocco break the agreement. But the protest movement has not ended. Instead, demonstrators have changed their tactics, including moving from urban centers to the country's ports. Over the past few months, protesters have been targeting ships docked in Morocco that are on their way to Israel to support the Israeli war effort. In April 2025, Morocco's largest labor union called for the government to ban such ships from Moroccan waters and facilitated a round of protests in support of Gaza.

Meanwhile, in Kuwait, the government has sought to prevent pro-Palestinian demonstrations in by banning such public protests. Kuwaitis have nevertheless found ways to show their support for the people of Gaza. The results of an Arab Barometer survey conducted in March 2024 indicated that 84 percent of respondents had boycotted companies that support Israel, 62 percent had made donations to support Gazans, 40 percent had shared pro-Palestinian messages on social media, and 22 percent had participated in public activities in solidarity with Gazans.

Although Arab governments have criticized Israel's conduct in Gaza, they have refrained from taking any steps that would make it harder for Israel to continue its military operations there. But this is not because citizens have moved on or because leaders can simply ignore such currents of opinion. Protests are happening every day across the region, and even if they are not driving sharp policy reversals by autocratic governments, they are constraining those governments' policy options. Before October 7, Saudi Arabia appeared to be close to normalizing ties with Israel, even without any path toward Palestinian independence in sight. In February 2025, by contrast, the Saudi Foreign Ministry released a statement of “firm and unwavering” support for establishing a Palestinian state, a position it described as “non-negotiable and not subject to compromises,” and stated that an independent Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital is a precondition for diplomatic relations with Israel. In March, Egypt released a proposal to rebuild Gaza that was based on an Arab-led reconstruction of and establishment of future security oversight for Gaza. The plan was unanimously approved by the Arab League and offered a stark contrast with Israeli and American visions of depopulating and seizing Gaza. It was intended in part to shore up public support for Arab governments, in response to their populations' demands that they take action. And despite Trump's goal of extending the Abraham Accords to other Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, that initiative seems unlikely to bear fruit any time soon.

Arab leaders may be unwilling to challenge Israel directly, but they are also unwilling to confront the public backlash that would result from closer cooperation. Moves by Arab governments, such as Morocco's cancellation of a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that had been planned for 2024, fall short of a dramatic split. But they have stunted Israel's integration into the region—a key goal of the Abraham Accords. Not only are Arab citizens turning out in support of the people of Gaza; their efforts are also changing regional dynamics in ways that challenge U.S. and Israeli interests. As long as Arab populations perceive U.S. and Western policies toward Israel to be based on double standards and impunity, this standoff will likely continue. And if Israel's Gaza campaign drags on and efforts to displace Gazans by force persist, it will most likely escalate.

WASHINGTON, June 12. /TASS/. US officials have been told that Israel is fully ready to launch an operation into Iran, CBS News reported, citing "multiple sources."

"The US anticipates Iran could retaliate on certain American sites in neighboring Iraq. This is part of the reason the U.S. advised some Americans to leave the region," the TV channel said on its website.

US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program in the coming days, according to the publication.

A representative of US military circles told TASS earlier that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth had authorized "the voluntary departure" of US military dependents from the Middle East due to security issues. In turn, the Department of State has ordered the departure of non-emergency US government personnel from Iraq due to heightened regional tensions. Commenting on those steps, US President Donald Trump said that Americans were advised to leave the region "because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens." He also noted that the US did not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. "We're not going to allow that," Trump stressed.

In recent weeks, the Washington administration has been concerned that Israel is preparing a strike on Iran despite ongoing negotiations on Tehran's nuclear program. Axios reported earlier, citing sources, that US President Donald Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a telephone conversation on June 9 to refrain from any action that could hinder the negotiations.

Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that Moscow possesses the world's most advanced nuclear systems but must significantly strengthen its ground forces, Russian state media reported on June 11.

As Russia continues its war against Ukraine, Moscow has increased investment in its military. Russian defense spending has reached its highest level since the Cold War at 6.3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Putin claimed that Russia's nuclear triad has the highest share of new equipment among nuclear powers.

"Currently, the share of modern weapons and equipment in the strategic nuclear forces is already 95%. This is a good indicator, in fact, it is the highest of all nuclear powers in the world," Russian state media reported Putin saying.

Putin then called for Russia's ground forces to be improved as quickly as possible.

"The dominant force in conducting modern military operations of any scale and intensity remains the ground forces. And it is important to increase their combat capabilities in the shortest possible time," he said.

Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia first began its armed aggression against Ukraine in 2014, when its proxies occupied territory in eastern Ukraine and Russia annexed Crimea.

Russia regularly strikes civilian infrastructure in its ongoing war against Ukraine. On June 11, a Russian drone attack on Kharkiv killed at least three people and injured 64 others.

Ukraine's stunning drone attack against Russian nuclear bombers has underscored the United States' own vulnerability to drone attacks.

On June 1, Ukraine carried out Spiderweb, an audacious attack on air bases deep inside Russian territory. The operation concealed drones in wooden sheds loaded onto trucks that were delivered by unsuspecting drivers to the perimeter of the bases. The roof panels of the sheds were then remotely lifted off, allowing the drones to fly out and begin their attack.

Riot police use a water cannon to disperse protestors gathered for a thrid night of anti-immigration demonstrations in Ballymena, Northern Ireland on June 11.PAUL FAITH/AFP/Getty Images

Violence erupted in different parts of Northern Ireland for the third successive night on Wednesday, with masked youths starting a fire in a leisure centre but unrest in the primary flashpoint of Ballymena was notably smaller in scale.

Hundreds of masked rioters attacked police and set homes and cars on fire in Ballymena, a town of 30,000 people located 45 kilometres (28 miles) from Belfast, on Tuesday night in what police condemned as “racist thuggery.”

The violence flared on Monday after two 14-year-old boys were arrested and appeared in court earlier that day, accused of a serious sexual assault on a teenage girl in the town.

The charges were read via a Romanian interpreter to the boys, whose lawyer told the court that they denied the charge, the BBC reported. Police are investigating the damaging of properties on Monday and Tuesday in Ballymena, which has a relatively large migrant population, as racially-motivated hate crimes.

Two Filipino families told Reuters they fled their home in Ballymena on Tuesday night after fearing for their safety when their car was set on fire outside the house.

A few dozen masked youths threw some rocks, fireworks and petrol bombs at police after officers in riot gear and armoured vans blocked roads in the town on Wednesday evening.

Police deployed water cannon against the crowd for the second successive night but the clashes were nothing like the previous night that left 17 officers injured and led to five arrests.

Much of the crowd had left the streets before midnight.

A small number of riot police were also in the town of Larne 30 kilometres west where masked youths smashed the windows of a leisure centre before starting fires in the lobby, BBC footage showed.

Swimming classes were taking place when bricks were thrown through the windows and staff had to barricade themselves in before running out the back door, a local Alliance Party lawmaker, Danny Donnelly, told the BBC.

Northern Ireland's Communities Minister Gordon Lyons had earlier posted on Facebook that a number of people had been temporarily moved to the leisure centre following the disturbances in Ballymena, before then being moved out of Larne.

The comments drew sharp criticism from other political parties for identifying a location used to shelter families seeking refuge from anti-immigrant violence. Lyons condemned the attacks on the centre.

Police said youths also set fires at a roundabout in the town of Newtownabbey, a flashpoint for sectarian violence that sporadically flares up in the British-run region 27 years after a peace deal largely ended three decades of bloodshed.

Debris was also set alight at a barricade in Coleraine, the Belfast Telegraph reported.

The British and Irish governments as well as local politicians have condemned the violence.

North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein speaks to reporters after a Council of State meeting at the state Department of Transportation building in Raleigh, N.C., Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025 (AP Photo/Gary D. Robertson,File)

GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.

The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro's airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.

The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing — also known as all-wing or blended-wing — Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.

JetZero has said it's already received about $300 million in investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.

United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production. 

Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina's robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.




“North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said. “North Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.”

The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project earlier Thursday to a state committee that awards economic incentives. 

State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.3 billion by the 2060s if investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met. 

A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee — more than $1 billion over 37 years — is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers' paychecks. The incentives also include up to $784 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and $450 million from the General Assembly to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures. 

A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.

JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.

“We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,” CEO Tom O'Leary said. “So this is more than just a factory. It's a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.”

While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.

The 5-year-old company says the plane's shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.

JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared. 

“It's going to deliver a better passenger experience than you've ever had before on any other plane,” O'Leary said. 

The state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets. 

The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County. 

North Carolina's previous largest economic development project, measured by employment, was revealed in 2022, when Vietnamese automaker VinFast announced plans to build an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Chatham County, promising 7,500 jobs.

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) was forcibly removed from a press conference with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles on Thursday. 

“I'm Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary. … Hands off me,” Padilla said as law enforcement pushed him out of the room. 

Padilla was then handcuffed by police officers in the hallway.

Responding to a question from a reporter about Padilla, Noem claimed that “he did not request a meeting with me, or just speak with me. So when I leave here, I'll have a conversation with him and visit and find out really what his concerns were.”

“I think everybody in America would agree that that wasn't appropriate, that if you wanted to have a civil discussion, especially as a leader, a public official, that you would reach out and try to have a conversation,” she said, adding, “I'll visit with the senator and find out what his concerns are.”

Padilla's office said in a press release sent out shortly after the incident that the senator is not currently detained, and that they are working on getting more information.

“Senator Padilla is currently in Los Angeles exercising his duty to perform Congressional oversight of the federal government's operations in Los Angeles and across California,” a statement from the senator's office read. “He was in the federal building to receive a briefing with General Guillot and was listening to Secretary Noem's press conference. He tried to ask the Secretary a question, and was forcibly removed by federal agents, forced to the ground and handcuffed.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement regarding Padilla's removal that the Democrat chose “disrespectful political theatre,” and interrupted the press conference “without identifying himself or having his Senate security pin on as he lunged toward Secretary Noem.”

The Department continued, “Mr. Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers' repeated commands. @SecretService thought he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately. Secretary Noem met with Senator Padilla after and held a 15 minute meeting.”

In response to Padilla's removal, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) called the senator “one of the most decent people I know.”

“This is outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control,” the governor said. “This must end now.”

Padilla was present and voting in the Senate this week until Thursday.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said Padilla's removal is “what Russia looks like, this is what China looks like.”

Padilla's Senate colleagues, who had just wrapped a series of votes in Washington as the first videos and images of the event began to surface, offered mixed reactions. Democrats were widely furious and vehemently condemned the encounter. Some Republicans also expressed dismay, but others suggested Padilla sought a made-for-TV moment and chastised him for missing Senate votes.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) called on Senate Republicans to condemn the incident, calling it “absolutely terrifying.”

“And if Republicans in the Senate don't condemn this loudly, we are losing our democracy,” Murphy told the Washington Examiner. “I mean, this is the end. We're watching the end of democracy. And you guys have a job to do. Everybody has a job to do right now.”Murphy declined to entertain questions on other subjects.He continued, “The only thing that matters right now is that there's a United States senator in handcuffs because he was doing his job.”

Multiple senators are trying to contact Padilla, including Murphy, who said, “It's hard to be on the phone when you're in handcuffs.”

Meanwhile, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) called the moment “sick.”

“To see how he was handled out of that room is wrong. It's sick,” she told reporters on Capitol Hill. 

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said he is looking to get “facts and find out exactly what happened,” and noted that “obviously, we will have a response.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) implied that Padilla was seeking a viral moment, telling reporters that he “got what he wanted. He's on video.”

Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY), in reaction to the video, said, “He's in California today, when we're voting in the United States Senate on important legislation for the country. He's not here. Is that right?”

When asked if he had seen the video, Barrasso deflected and asked reporters if they had seen the video of golfer Rory McIlroy's drive earlier Thursday morning at the U.S. Open.

“Somebody said this video has been out like, what, 30 minutes?, Barrasso remarked, “Do you think most senators have seen it? I'm sure the Democrats have.”

Noem was in Los Angeles addressing protests over a series of sweeps executed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The majority of the demonstrations have been peaceful, but some became chaotic over the weekend.

President Donald Trump deployed roughly 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to the city. Newsom filed a lawsuit to stop troops from coming to California.

On Tuesday, an overnight curfew was imposed in a square-mile radius of the protest area. Protests have reduced in size since.

            Chipmaker Nvidia will exclude the Chinese market from its revenue and profit forecasts following the imposition of tough US restrictions on chip sales to China, its CEO said Thursday.
    


            Asked whether the US will lift export controls after trade talks with China in London this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNN's Anna Stewart in Paris: “I'm not counting on it but, if it happens, then it will be a great bonus. I've told all of our investors and shareholders that, going forward, our forecasts will not include the China market.”
    


            In recent years, Washington has stepped up efforts to restrict China's access to American chip-related technologies, aiming to prevent Beijing from using US innovations to bolster its military and artificial intelligence capabilities.
    


            Huang's comments underscore the impact of Washington's chip curbs on Nvidia, a company once best known for its video game graphics processors, that has profited tremendously from growing demand for AI chips and infrastructure. The company blew past Wall Street's revenue expectations in its first quarter of 2025, posting a 69% increase from the same period last year.

            But Nvidia missed out on an additional $2.5 billion in revenue because export restrictions prevented it from shipping its H20 AI chips to China. The company developed that chip specifically to accommodate US export controls but was told in April that it would need a special license to do so. Nvidia took a smaller hit than expected from the excess inventory, however: a $4.5 billion charge compared to the $5.5 billion it had expected.
    


            Kevin Hassett, director of the US National Economic Council, told CNBC Monday that the Trump administration might be open to loosening restrictions on exports of some microchips that China views as critical to its manufacturing sector. But the United States will maintain curbs on “very, very high-end Nvidia” chips that are capable of powering AI systems, he added.
    


            On Thursday, Nvidia's Huang again criticized US chip export controls.
    


            “The goals of the export controls are not being achieved,” he told CNN. “Whatever those goals are that were being discussed initially, (they) are apparently not working. And so I think, with all export controls, the goals have to be well-articulated and tested over time.”
    


            Last month, Huang said at a news conference in Taiwan that the US curbs on chip exports were a “failure” and warned that the restrictions were doing more damage to American business than to China.
    


            Nvidia's position as a critical supplier of AI chips has put it in the middle of the tech race between the US and China, which escalated earlier this year with the arrival of Chinese tech startup DeepSeek's supposedly cheap yet sophisticated AI model. The Trump administration has been eager to position the US as a leader in AI, with Vice President JD Vance saying that “excessive regulation of the AI sector” could “kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off” during remarks at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris earlier this year.
    


            Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said easing export controls could be necessary to prevent China from gaining an edge in AI.
    


            “With the AI Revolution hitting its next gear of growth it is important for China tech players they get access to Nvidia chips with the current H20 ban essentially handing a good portion of Nvidia's business directly to Huawei on a silver platter,” he wrote in a June 11 industry note.
    


            In the meantime, Nvidia continues to expand – aiming to cement its place as a major AI player globally. Huang announced on Thursday that his company will build the world's first cloud computing platform for industrial artificial intelligence applications in Europe. It also said its Blackwell architecture will power new AI infrastructure projects in Europe.

LOS ANGELES – A driver who went viral for allegedly dropping off "bionic shield" face masks to Los Angeles rioters on Tuesday was arrested by the FBI in a sting at his home Thursday morning.

Alejandro Theodoro Orellana was taken into custody on suspicion of conspiracy to commit civil disorders.

After the arrest, U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli spoke with Fox News.

"We have made it a huge priority to try to identify, locate and arrest those who are involved in organizing, supporting, funding or facilitating these riots," he said.

"It appears they're well-orchestrated, and coordinated and well-funded, so we want to understand who these people are and where this organization's coming from and today was one of those first arrests, the key arrests that we did."

A federal court hearing is scheduled for Thursday challenging President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard and Marines to support immigration raids in Los Angeles.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom warns that the military intervention is the onset of a much broader effort by Trump to overturn norms at the heart of America's political system. Testifying Thursday before Congress, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called it "an assault on our American values."

The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday ordered federal prosecutors to prioritize criminal prosecution of protesters who destroy property or assault law enforcement, and to make sure every case they bring gets publicized, according to an internal email seen by Reuters.

The email, which was sent to all 93 U.S. attorneys, comes a week after a wave of protests that started in Los Angeles and have spread to other major cities against Trump's immigration crackdown. Trump has dispatched some 700 U.S. Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, saying they are needed to back up immigration raids.

"There should be no bottleneck of referrals for complaints and legal process," wrote Associate Deputy Attorney General Aakash Singh.

SURPRISE — THOSE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF TRUMP ‘CRASHING' THE ECONOMY WERE WRONG. Six weeks ago, the Democratic talking point was that President Donald Trump was “crashing” the economy with his tariff policy. You heard it over and over, both from party leaders and their allies in the media.

Fast forward to today, and the Washington Post headline is “Trump economy shows surprising resilience despite tariff impacts.” Taking note of a number of encouraging indicators, the paper said that Trump's various trade wars may have rattled corporate boardrooms — they could have mentioned media commentators, too — but “the U.S. economy so far has kept humming along.”

“The latest encouraging sign came Wednesday, when the Labor Department reported that inflation remained mild in May, rising at an annual pace of 2.4% — less than economists had anticipated,” the Washington Post reported. And this: “The labor market continues to chug as well, adding a healthy 139,000 jobs last month, which also beat expectations.” All in all, it was a “wave of good news” that “surprised” analysts who had widely predicted “higher inflation and weaker hiring” in the Trump economy.

“For four months, many economists have predicted that U.S. inflation would reignite, in large part due to President Donald Trump's trade war and the knock-on effects his tariffs would have on the economy,” Bloomberg added. “But for the fourth month in a row, data released by the Trump administration's Bureau of Labor Statistics came in lower than expected.”

So what happened with the dire outlook for Trump's tariffs? There has been evidence of some effects, but not a lot. “With respect to the tariffs, there was upward pressure present in appliance prices — exactly the kind of imported durable goods one would expect to be affected — that one might attribute to tariffs,” writes Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “But auto prices declined during the month; not exactly what analysts expected. Looking forward, it appears that the tariff impacts will phase in slowly over the summer instead of showing a sharp uptick.”

Six weeks ago, even some Trump supporters predicted that inflation would kick in quickly with the president's tariffs. “I've got to confess, I've been wrong on the inflation numbers over the last three or four months,” economist Stephen Moore said recently. “I did think that tariffs would raise prices. They did a little bit but not much, and that was offset by the fact that the economy is doing really well. We're producing more goods and services, and this is just basic supply-side economics. If you produce more eggs and you produce more oil, guess what? The prices of these things go down.”

Readers should appreciate Moore's candor. The fact is that a lot of predictions about the economy, not to mention Democratic/media talking points, have been wrong. Some of them, the Democrats', were in bad faith and politically motivated. Others were the result of groupthink. Others were sincere differences of opinion. But the fact is, they were wrong.

That does not mean they will always be wrong. As this newsletter noted six weeks ago, “We should always note that we don't know what will happen in the future. The economy might indeed crash, or it might boom.” But be skeptical when anyone, and especially a partisan, seems a little too eager to declare the economy a disaster.

Former federal prosecutor Jonathan Fahey discusses President Donald Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants and more on ‘Fox News Live.'

A U.S. appeals court agreed to pause a lower court order requiring the Trump administration to provide due process to hundreds of Venezuelan migrants deported from the U.S. to El Salvador under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act in a near-term victory for the Trump administration. 

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted the Justice Department's request for an administrative stay, putting on hold a lower court order handed down last week by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg.

Last Wednesday, Boasberg ruled that the migrants deported solely on the basis of the Alien Enemies Act immigration law did not have prior notice of their removals or the ability to challenge their removals in court, in a violation of due process.

He ordered the Trump administration to provide migrants deported under the law the opportunity to seek habeas relief, and the opportunity to challenge their alleged gang member status that the administration had pointed to as the basis for their removal.

WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?

Boasberg had given the Trump administration through Wednesday to submit to the court plans for how it would go about providing habeas relief to the plaintiffs in CECOT, the maximum security prison in El Salvador. 

This week, lawyers for the Trump administration filed an emergency motion to stay the ruling in both the U.S. District Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on Tuesday, one day before that plan was due, seeking additional time to respond to the underlying merits of Boasberg's ruling.

Justice Department officials argued that Boasberg did not have jurisdiction in the case, as the migrants are detained in El Salvador, and said his order interfered "with the president's removal of dangerous criminal aliens from the United States."

Boasberg's final order last week did not attempt to determine who had jurisdiction. Instead, he set the matter aside, and said the individuals could remain in custody at CECOT, so long as the government submitted plans to the court for how they would be provided a chance to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act.

The Trump administration still took umbrage with that ruling, which it blasted earlier this week in their appeal as "unprecedented, baseless and constitutionally offensive."

SUPREME COURT GRANTS TRUMP REQUEST TO LIFT STAY HALTING VENEZUELAN DEPORTATIONS

"The district court's increasingly fantastical injunctions continue to threaten serious harm to the government's national-security and foreign-affairs interests," they told the circuit court. 

The court "correctly ruled that the United States lacks constructive custody over the aliens held at CECOT and therefore that this Court lacks jurisdiction over their habeas claims," attorneys for the Justice Department said in their motion. "That should have been the end of this case."

That order sparked fierce backlash from senior Trump officials, who have blasted Bosaberg and other federal judges who have ruled in ways unfavorable to them as "activist judges."

Boasberg, however, was the first federal judge to try to block Trump's attempt to use the law to summarily deport certain migrants to El Salvador earlier this year, putting him squarely in the crosshairs of the Trump administration.

On March 15, he granted a temporary restraining order attempting to block the first wave of deportation flights to El Salvador, and ordered the administration to "immediately" return to the U.S. all planes that had already departed.

That did not happen, however, and the planes landed hours later in El Salvador.

In the months since, Boasberg attempted to hold various fact-finding hearings to determine who knew what, and when, about the flights. 

He later found probable cause to hold the administration in contempt of the court, citing the government's "willful disregard" for his March 15 emergency order, though those proceedings were later halted by a federal appeals court.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday he has ordered the deployment of more than 5,000 Texas National Guard troops, along with more than 2,000 state police, to help local law enforcement manage protests against President Donald Trump and the ongoing federal immigration raids.

Abbott's announcement did not detail where the troops were sent, but some were seen at a protest Wednesday night in downtown San Antonio near the Alamo. That protest drew hundreds of demonstrators but did not erupt into violence.

More protests are planned on Saturday in San Antonio and across Texas in cities such as Houston, Austin and Dallas as part of the national “No Kings” movement.

Protests earlier this week in Austin and Dallas led to brief clashes with police who used chemical irritants to disperse the crowds. About a dozen were arrested.

“Peaceful protests are part of the fabric of our nation, but Texas will not tolerate the lawlessness we have seen in Los Angeles in response to President Donald Trump's enforcement of immigration law,” Abbott said. “Anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property will be arrested and held accountable to the full extent of the law.”

The Republican Texas governor's move stands in sharp contrast to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who has publicly clashed with Trump over his decision to deploy National Guard and Marine personnel in Los Angeles. 




Mayors in San Antonio and Austin have said they did not ask for Abbott to mobilize the National Guard to their cities.

Abbott, who has been governor since 2014, has been aggressive in deploying the Guard in the past, particularly for immigration enforcement on the border. 

Since 2021, the Texas Guard has played a prominent role in Abbott's Operation Lone Star, and thousands of troops have been deployed to help clamp down on border crossings. An agreement with the Trump administration in February gave Texas National Guard soldiers the authority to arrest and detain people for entering the U.S. illegally from Mexico.

Texas also has established a permanent border base for Guard troops, an 80-acre (30-hectare) installation that will house up to 1,800 troops when completed.

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his take on President Donald Trump taking action against the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles as he continues to advocate law and order. 

FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.., is introducing legislation that creates new penalties for rioters who burn the American flag Thursday, Fox News Digital has learned.

Hawley says he discussed the flag burnings in Los Angeles with President Donald Trump and the pair agreed that desecrating the American flag should come with additional penalties. If passed, the bill would add one year in prison for flag burners on top of any rioting conviction.

Hawley referenced images and video coming out of Los Angeles showing dozens of protesters and rioters burning American flags, with many waving foreign flags instead.

"I would hope that every Republican would vote for it. Even my Democratic colleagues," Hawley told Fox in an interview. "This is the symbol of our nation."

While courts have deemed flag burning in certain contexts to be protected expression, Hawley argues that protection falls away when a flag is burned "in furtherance of committing a federal crime," such as rioting.

"No one loves or cares for our beautiful flag more than President Trump, and no one has been stronger than President Trump on supporting law enforcement against violent rioters and malcontents," White House spokesman Kush Desai said in response Thursday.

Trump himself lashed out at flag-burners in Los Angeles during a Tuesday speech at Fort Bragg commemorating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.

"These are animals, but they proudly carry the flags of other countries. They don't carry the American flag. They only burn it. Did you see a lot of the flags being burned?" Trump asked the crowd of service members, veterans, and their families.

"They weren't being burned by people from our country, or from people that love our country. People that burn the American flag should go to jail for one year," Trump continued.

"We'll see if we can get that done. We're going to try and get that done. We're working with some of your senators," he added. "Senator Josh Hawley is very much involved."

Trump reiterated his stance about potential jail time for those who burn American flags during an interview on a podcast hosted by New York Post columnist Miranda Devine on Monday.

"I happen to think if you burn an American flag — because they were burning a lot of flags in Los Angeles — I think you go to jail for one year. Just automatic," once again referencing the details of the bill.

In addition to potential criminal penalties for rioters, Trump has suggested he may try to go after Gov. Gavin Newsom for interfering with ICE operations in Los Angeles.

During the president's comments at Fort Bragg, Trump also noted that his administration is looking into who may be "financing" the protests, saying "we're going to find out through Pam Bondi and Department of Justice who it is."

Hawley has also launched a congressional investigation into alleged financial support for the rioters.

As the anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement riots in Los Angeles rage on, more protests are being planned for this weekend in the name of the “No Kings” movement.

The movement, explicitly anti-Trump and anti-authoritarianism, is encouraging cities all over the country to organize and demonstrate on Saturday.

Here's everything you need to know about the “No Kings” movement:

“No Kings” was created by the 50501 Movement. The number represents “50 protests in 50 states on one day,” according to the group's website. The group's first protests, which date back to February, voiced opposition to President Donald Trump‘s “anti-democratic and illegal actions.”

The phrase “No Kings” refers to the group's desire to see Trump “dethroned,” as it believes his leadership resembles that of a king more than an elected president, according to the Associated Press.

The group identifies as a “grassroots movement,” saying independent volunteers organize all its local events. It also expects participants in its protests to practice nonviolence, according to its website.

“No Kings” is asking citizens all over the country to rise up and protest on Saturday, June 14, also known as Flag Day, according to its website.

LEFT-WING GROUPS PLAN EVENTS TO COUNTER ARMY'S 250TH DC BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION

The full list of cities, which includes Chicago and Atlanta, participating in the “No Kings” protests on Saturday is extensive. However, while Virginia's Alexandria, Arlington, and Culpeper counties, as well as Maryland, have protests planned, the “No Kings” movement will not be in Washington, D.C., according to WTOP News.

The protests are an attempt to overshadow the military parade to honor the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army and Trump's birthday, as well as oppose Trump's “authoritarianism.”

“No Kings is a nationwide day of defiance,” the group's website says. “From city blocks to small towns, from courthouse steps to community parks, we're taking action to reject authoritarianism — and show the world what democracy really looks like.”

At the various protests across the country, demonstrators will march, hear speeches, and carry signs and American flags, organizers told the outlet. On its website, the group asks demonstrators to refrain from bringing weapons to events.

SENIOR REPUBLICANS WON'T STICK AROUND FOR TRUMP'S BIG-BUDGET MILITARY PARADE

Millions of people are expected to participate in the protests, which would make Saturday the largest collective demonstration since Trump resumed office, organizers told the outlet.

“No Kings” protests date back to February, when notable demonstrations took place nationwide on Presidents Day. Protesting the actions of Trump and Elon Musk and their Department of Government Efficiency, participants marched and raised signs that said, “No Kings on Presidents Day.” Several other protests affiliated with the movement have occurred since then, according to Newsweek.

Although the movement advocates nonviolence and peaceful demonstration at all its events, that didn't stop some participants at the President's Day protests in Arizona and Washington, D.C., from causing chaos. A group of protesters reportedly tried to enter the state Capitol in Arizona, and another protester in D.C. allegedly sprayed paint in the face of a Trump supporter, according to the outlet.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — President Donald Trump's use of troops to help carry out intensified immigration raids faces its biggest challenge yet on Thursday, when a federal judge is set to weigh a request from California Gov. Gavin Newsom to put an emergency stop to the practice.

Newsom has warned that the military intervention is part of a broader effort by Trump to overturn norms at the heart of the nation's democracy. He also said that sending National Guard troops on the raids has further inflamed tensions in Los Angeles, where large and sometimes volatile protests have broken out since the crackdown began nearly a week ago.

The Trump administration on Wednesday called the lawsuit a “crass political stunt endangering American lives.” A hearing is set for Thursday afternoon in San Francisco.

Demonstrations have picked up across the U.S., with protests emerging in more than a dozen major cities. On Wednesday, police in Seattle used pepper spray to clear out protesters, and officers in Denver used smoke and pepper balls to control a crowd.

Police in riot gear — many on horseback — charged at a group of protesters Wednesday night in LA just before the start of the second night of the city's downtown curfew. The officers struck some demonstrators with wooden rods and later fired crowd-control projectiles. After the curfew went into effect, a handful of arrests were made before the area cleared out.

The Trump administration has rapidly expanded military to deployments to Los Angeles over the past week and has said it is willing to send troops to other cities to assist with immigration enforcement and controlling disturbances — in line with what Trump promised during last year's campaign.

Some 2,000 Guard soldiers are in the nation's second-largest city and are soon to be joined by 2,000 more, along with about 700 Marines, said Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, who's in charge of the operation.

About 500 of the Guard troops deployed to the Los Angeles protests have been trained to accompany agents on immigration operations, the commander said Wednesday. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers, but any arrests must be made by law enforcement.

While some troops have already gone on such missions, he said it's too early to say if that will continue even after the protests die down.

“We are expecting a ramp-up,” Sherman said, noting that protests across the nation were being discussed. “I'm focused right here in LA, what's going on right here. But you know, I think we're, we're very concerned.”

With more demonstrations expected over the weekend, and the possibility that Trump could send troops to other states for immigration enforcement, governors are weighing what to do.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has put 5,000 National Guard members on standby in cities where demonstrations are planned. In other Republican-controlled states, governors have not said when or how they're planning to deploy troops for protests.

A group of Democratic governors earlier this week signed a statement calling Trump's deployments “an alarming abuse of power.”

“Illinois follows the law. But let me be clear: We expect the federal government to follow the law too,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Thursday during a Capitol Hill hearing on state immigration policies. “We will not participate in abuses of power.”

Dozens of mayors from across the Los Angeles region banded together Wednesday to demand that the Trump administration end the stepped-up immigration raids and stop using military troops alongside agents.

“I'm asking you, please listen to me, stop terrorizing our residents,” said Brenda Olmos, vice mayor of Paramount, who said she was hit by rubber bullets over the weekend. “You need to stop these raids.”

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the raids spread fear at the behest of the White House and that the city's nightly curfew would remain in effect as long as necessary. It covers a section of downtown where the protests have been concentrated in the sprawling city.

“If there are raids that continue, if there are soldiers marching up and down our streets, I would imagine that the curfew will continue,” Bass said.

Those who have been caught up in the nationwide raids at car washes and home improvement stores include asylum seekers, people who overstayed their visas and migrants awaiting their day in immigration court. 

Los Angeles police have made about 470 arrests and detentions since Saturday, the vast majority of which were for failing to leave the area at the request of law enforcement, according to the police department.

There have been a handful of more serious charges, including for assault against police officers and for possession of a Molotov cocktail and a gun. Nine police officers have been hurt, mostly with minor injures. Some were transported to a hospital and released.

Fox News contributor Brett Velicovich joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the use of predator drones to monitor violence amid the LA riots and the importance of President Donald Trump investing in drone advancements. 

FIRST ON FOX: Los Angeles rioters, who are ravaging the streets in protest of deporting illegal migrants, forced three Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) facilities in the LA area to shut down due to safety concerns, delaying nearly 300 legal migrants from receiving their hard-fought American citizenship. 

"Anti-ICE rioters are creating havoc and destroying the very communities they are purportedly advocating for," USCIS Spokesperson Matthew Tragesser told Fox News Digital. 

USCIS data obtained by Fox News Digital shows that 790 aliens had green card appointments canceled, 1,000 aliens had naturalization interviews canceled, and nearly 300 aliens who were scheduled were not able to attend their long-awaited naturalization ceremony.

The naturalization ceremony is the final step in achieving what for many is a hard-fought journey to successfully immigrating legally into the U.S. For Green Card holders, there is typically a 5-year lawful permanent resident period required to achieve naturalization. 

Sources at USCIS tell Fox that legal migrants whose appointments and naturalization ceremonies will be delayed for roughly 30–45 days.

Rioters, who set cars ablaze, looted retailers, and covered police stations and streets with explicit graffiti have been protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) removal of illegal immigrants since June 6.

NEWSOM SAYS LOS ANGELES RIOTERS WILL BE PROSECUTED, SLAMS TRUMP FOR 'TRAUMATIZING OUR COMMUNITIES'

President Donald Trump authorized roughly 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 US Marines over the weekend in an effort to stifle the riots. The deployment of federal troops was rebuked by Gavin Newsom, who filed a federal court motion to grant the state a temporary restraining order to restrict the deployment of military personnel.

Rep. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., questions Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during House Armed Services Committee hearing.

A California Democrat told Pete Hegseth on Thursday that he is an "embarrassment" to the United States and should "get the hell out" of the Department of Defense after the Secretary chided the lawmaker for a "silly question" he asked during a house hearing.

The outburst from Rep. Salud Carbajal was immediately followed by a call for decorum as lawmakers from the House Armed Services Committee were questioning Hegseth about the Department of Defense's Fiscal Year 2026 budget request.

Tensions started escalating on Capitol Hill as Carbajal asked Hegseth a series of yes or no questions, beginning with the deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines in Los Angeles to quell the unrest generated by anti-ICE protests. 

"Let's call it for what it is. It's political theater. Hegseth, are the Marines in Los Angeles ordered to protect property by any means necessary?" Carbajal asked him.

"Sir, I would say the ICE officers and police officers being attacked is not political theater," he responded, before Carbajal cut him off and said "just yes or no?"

"The National Guard and Marines have the full authority to protect federal ICE agents," Hegseth continued.

"Yes or no? Can you just say yes or no? This isn't Fox anymore. Just yes or no," Carbajal said.

At one point, Carbajal told Hegseth that "Kindergartners can give me a yes or no" and asked him "Do you think political allegiance to Trump is a requirement for serving our nation, either in uniform or a civilian in the department?"

"Congressman, you know what a silly question that is," Hegseth responded.

"You know what? I'm not going to waste my time anymore. You're not worthy of my attention or my questions. You're an embarrassment to this country. You're unfit to lead. And there's been bipartisan members of Congress that have called for your resignation. You should just get the hell out and let somebody competently lead this department," Carbajal concluded.

In his opening statement, Hegseth said "Under President Trump's leadership, this budget puts America first and gives our warriors what they need. The $961 billion budget request -- more than 1 trillion in total for national security -- ends four years of chronic underinvestment in our military."

"We are restoring the warrior ethos. President Trump charged me to focus relentlessly on war fighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards and readiness. And that is exactly what we've done since day one. We are refocusing on what is truly important, which is war fighting and our warriors, sweeping away distractions and bureaucracy. We are setting standards that are high, equal and unwavering," Hegseth continued.

"DEI is dead. We replaced it with a colorblind, gender-neutral, merit-based approach. Our forces are responding incredibly to these changes. Because of President Trump and his America First priorities, recruitment and retention under this administration are higher than they've been in decades. Historic numbers of young Americans are putting on the uniform and raising their right hand because they believe in the leadership they see," he added.

Hegseth also told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that "we applaud allies who are stepping up, but others need to do more, and they need to do it quickly and at the NATO heads of state meeting later this month, we expect our NATO allies to commit to 5% of GDP on defense and defense related investments, something that was almost inconceivable before President Trump led the charge in his first administration and continues in this one."

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday he has ordered the deployment of more than 5,000 Texas National Guard troops, along with more than 2,000 state police, to help local law enforcement manage protests against President Donald Trump and the ongoing federal immigration raids.

Abbott's announcement did not detail where the troops were sent, but some were seen at a protest Wednesday night in downtown San Antonio near the Alamo. That protest drew hundreds of demonstrators but did not erupt into violence.

More protests are planned on Saturday in San Antonio and across Texas in cities such as Houston, Austin and Dallas as part of the national “No Kings” movement.

Protests earlier this week in Austin and Dallas led to brief clashes with police who used chemical irritants to disperse the crowds. About a dozen were arrested.

“Peaceful protests are part of the fabric of our nation, but Texas will not tolerate the lawlessness we have seen in Los Angeles in response to President Donald Trump's enforcement of immigration law,” Abbott said. “Anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property will be arrested and held accountable to the full extent of the law.”

The Republican Texas governor's move stands in sharp contrast to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who has publicly clashed with Trump over his decision to deploy National Guard and Marine personnel in Los Angeles. 




Mayors in San Antonio and Austin have said they did not ask for Abbott to mobilize the National Guard to their cities.

Abbott, who has been governor since 2014, has been aggressive in deploying the Guard in the past, particularly for immigration enforcement on the border. 

Since 2021, the Texas Guard has played a prominent role in Abbott's Operation Lone Star, and thousands of troops have been deployed to help clamp down on border crossings. An agreement with the Trump administration in February gave Texas National Guard soldiers the authority to arrest and detain people for entering the U.S. illegally from Mexico.

Texas also has established a permanent border base for Guard troops, an 80-acre (30-hectare) installation that will house up to 1,800 troops when completed.

Former CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield discusses the ‘Make America Healthy Again' movement and pesticides in food on ‘Fox News Live.'

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday that he has selected eight new people to join the national vaccine panel after firing all 17 of its members. 

In an X post, Kennedy revealed that he "took a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines" on Monday by reconstituting the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP). 

"I retired the 17 current members of the committee. I'm now repopulating ACIP with the eight new members who will attend ACIP's scheduled June 25 meeting," Kennedy wrote on Wednesday. "The slate includes highly credentialed scientists, leading public-health experts, and some of America's most accomplished physicians. All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense." 

The new members are: Joseph R. Hibbeln, MD; Martin Kulldorff, MD, PhD; Retsef Levi, PhD; Robert W. Malone, MD; Cody Meissner, MD; James Pagano, MD; Vicky Pebsworth, OP, PhD, RN; and Michael A. Ross, MD. 

The secretary said all eight people "have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations." He said the committee will review safety and efficacy data for the current schedule."

 RFK JR TO REQUIRE ALL NEW VACCINES TO UNDERGO PLACEBO TESTING

Notably, Kulldorff was one of the co-authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, which was written alongside Dr. Sunetra Gupta of Oxford University and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University. 

The declaration, published in October 2020, promoted lifting lockdown orders sooner and allowing COVID-19 to spread among young, healthy people to more quickly reach herd immunity. The strategy also included precautions to shield those most vulnerable to severe illness, and the authors said the approach would help mitigate the long-term societal and economic harms of prolonged lockdown orders. 

It was condemned harshly at the time by the World Health Organization and Dr. Anthony Fauci, then-Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

On Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said, "We're going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel – not anti-vaxxers – bringing people on who are credentialed scientists."

Kennedy on Monday ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria. 

ACIP members typically serve staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one "consumer representative" who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs. The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Kennedy provided a brief biography of each of his new picks. 

Hibbeln is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist with a career in clinical research, public health policy and federal service. 

"As former Acting Chief of the Section on Nutritional Neurosciences at the National Institutes of Health, he led research on immune regulation, neurodevelopment, and mental health," Kennedy wrote. "His work has informed U.S. public health guidelines, particularly in maternal and child health. With more than 120 peer-reviewed publications and extensive experience in federal advisory roles, Dr. Hibbeln brings expertise in immune-related outcomes, psychiatric conditions, and evidence-based public health strategies."

Kulldorff is a biostatistician and epidemiologist formerly at Harvard Medical School and a leading expert in vaccine safety and infectious disease surveillance. 

"He has served on the Food and Drug Administration's Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee and the CDC's Vaccine Safety Subgroup of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, where he contributed to national vaccine safety monitoring systems," Kennedy wrote, adding that he developed tools used "for detecting disease outbreaks and vaccine adverse events.," and has expertise that "includes statistical methods for public health surveillance, immunization safety, and infectious disease epidemiology."

Levi is the Professor of Operations Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a leading expert in healthcare analytics, risk management, and vaccine safety. 

"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks. His research has contributed to discussions on vaccine manufacturing processes, safety surveillance, and public health policy," Kennedy wrote, adding that Levi "has also served on advisory committees and engaged in policy discussions concerning vaccine safety and efficacy," and that his "work continues to inform national and international debates on immunization safety and health system resilience." 

Malone is a physician-scientist and biochemist known for his early contributions to mRNA vaccine technology, specifically "foundational research in the late 1980s on lipid-mediated mRNA delivery, which laid the groundwork for later developments in mRNA-based therapeutics," Kennedy wrote, adding that Malone's "expertise spans molecular biology, immunology, and vaccine development."

Meissner is a Professor of Pediatrics at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth and a nationally recognized expert in pediatric infectious diseases and vaccine policy. 

"He has served as Section Chief of Pediatric Infectious Disease at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and has held advisory roles with both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)," Kennedy wrote, adding that Meissner was a voting member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, through which "he has contributed to national immunization guidelines and regulatory decisions."

"His expertise spans vaccine development, immunization safety, and pediatric infectious disease epidemiology. Dr. Meissner has also been a contributing author to American Academy of Pediatrics policy statements and immunization schedules, helping shape national standards for pediatric care." 

Pagano is a board-certified Emergency Medicine physician with over 40 years of clinical experience following his residency at UCLA. 

"He has worked in diverse emergency settings, from Level 1 trauma centers to small community hospitals, caring for patients across all age groups, including infants, pregnant women, and the elderly," Kennedy wrote, adding that he has also served on various committees and medical executive boards. "He is [a] strong advocate for evidence-based medicine."

Pebsworth earned a doctorate in public health and nursing from the University of Michigan. 

"She has worked in the healthcare field for more than 45 years, serving in various capacities, including critical care nurse, healthcare administrator, health policy analyst, and research scientist with a focus on public health policy, bioethics, and vaccine safety," Kennedy wrote, pointing to her current leadership role with the National Association of Catholic Nurses, and previous positions with the FDA's Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee's 2009 H1N1 Vaccine Safety Risk Assessment Working Group and Vaccine Safety Working Group.

Ross is a Clinical Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, with a career spanning clinical medicine, research, and public health policy.

"He has served on the CDC's Advisory Committee for the Prevention of Breast and Cervical Cancer, where he contributed to national strategies for cancer prevention and early detection, including those involving HPV immunization," Kennedy wrote, pointing to his experience with "clinical investigations with immunologic relevance," advising organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and advocacy efforts related to women's health. 

"His continued service on biotech and healthcare boards reflects his commitment to advancing innovation in immunology, reproductive medicine, and public health," Kennedy added.

Troops marching in lockstep. Patriotic tunes filling the air. The commander in chief looking on at it all. 

The military parade commemorating the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary and coinciding with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday will be a new spectacle for many Americans.

This will not be the first U.S. military parade. However, it is unusual outside of wartime, and Trump's approach stands out compared to his predecessors.

The Army had long planned a celebration for its semi-quincentennial on June 14. Trump has wanted to preside over a grand military parade since his first presidency from 2017 to 2021. When he took office a second time, he found the ideal convergence and ratcheted the Pentagon's plans into a full-scale military parade on his birthday. 

The president, who is expected to speak in Washington as part of the affair, pitches the occasion as a way to celebrate U.S. power and service members' sacrifice. But there are bipartisan concerns about the cost as well as concerns about whether Trump is blurring traditional understandings of what it means to be a civilian commander in chief.

Ceremonial reviews — troops looking their best and conducting drills for top commanders — trace back through medieval kingdoms to ancient empires of Rome, Persia and China. The pageantry continued in the young U.S. republic: Early presidents held military reviews as part of Fourth of July independence celebrations. That ended with James K. Polk, who was president from 1845 to 1849.

President Andrew Johnson resurrected the tradition in 1865, holding a two-day “Grand Review of the Armies” five weeks after Abraham Lincoln's assassination. It came after Johnson declared the Civil War over, a show of force meant to salve a war-weary nation — though more fighting and casualties would occur. Infantry, cavalry and artillery units — 145,000 soldiers, and even cattle — traversed Pennsylvania Avenue. Johnson, his Cabinet and top Army officers, including Ulysses S. Grant, Lincoln's last commanding general and the future 18th president, watched from a White House viewing stand.

The Spanish-American War was the first major international conflict for a reunited nation since the Civil War. It ended in a U.S. victory that established an American empire: Spain ceded Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Guam, and the U.S. purchased the Philippines for $20 million. Puerto Rico and Guam remain U.S. territories.

New York City hosted multiple celebrations of a new global power. In August 1898, a fleet of warships, including the Brooklyn, the Texas, and the Oregon, sailed up the North River, more commonly known today as the Hudson River. American inventor Thomas Edison filmed the floating parade. The following September, New York hosted a naval and street parade to welcome home Rear Adm. George Dewey, who joined President William McKinley in a viewing stand. 

Many U.S. cities held World War I victory parades a few decades later. But neither Washington nor President Woodrow Wilson was the focal point. In Boston, a million civilians celebrated 20,000 troops in 1919. New York honored 25,000 troops marching in full uniform and combat gear.

On June 13, 1942, as U.S. involvement in World War II accelerated, about 30,000 people formed a mobilization parade in New York City. Participants included Army and Navy personnel, American Women's Voluntary Services members, Boy Scouts and military school cadets. Scores of floats rolled, too. One carried a massive bust of President Franklin Roosevelt, who did not attend.

Less than four years later, the 82nd Airborne Division and Sherman tanks led a victory parade down Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, the Allied commander during World War II, rode in a victory parade in Washington. In 1952, Eisenhower would join Grant and George Washington as top wartime commanders elevated to the presidency following their military achievements. Other World War II generals were honored in other homecoming parades.

The U.S. did not hold national or major city parades after wars in Korea and Vietnam. Both ended without clear victory; Vietnam, especially, sparked bitter societal division, enough so that President Gerald Ford opted against a strong military presence in 1976 bicentennial celebrations, held a year after the fall of Saigon.

Washington finally hosted a victory parade in 1991 after the first Persian Gulf War. The Constitution Avenue lineup included 8,000 troops, tanks, Patriot missiles and representatives of the international coalition, led by the U.S., that quickly drove an invading Iraq out of Kuwait. The commander in chief, George H.W. Bush, is the last U.S. president to have held an active-duty military post. He had been a World War II combat pilot who survived his plane being shot down over the Pacific Ocean.

Veterans of the second Iraq and Afghanistan wars that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks have not been honored in national parades. 

Inaugural parades include and sometimes feature military elements. 

Eisenhower's 1953 inaugural parade, at the outset of the Cold War, included 22,000 service members and an atomic cannon. Eight years later, President John F. Kennedy, a World War II Naval officer, watched armored tanks, Army and Navy personnel, dozens of missiles and Navy boats pass in front of his reviewing stand.

More recent inaugurations have included honor guards, academy cadets, military bands and other personnel but not large combat assets. Notably, U.S. presidents, even when leading or attending military events, wear civilian attire rather than military garb, a standard set by Washington, who also eschewed being called “General Washington” in favor of “Mr. President.”

Perhaps the lone exception came in 2003, when President George W. Bush, who had been a National Guard pilot, wore a flight suit when he landed on the USS Abraham Lincoln and declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq, which U.S. forces had invaded six weeks earlier. The aircraft carrier was not a parade venue but the president emerged to raucous cheers from uniformed service members. He put on a business suit to deliver a nationally televised speech in front a “Mission Accomplished” banner. 

As the war dragged on to a less decisive outcome, that scene and its enduring images would become a political liability for the president.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition have faced the most serious challenge to their power since Oct. 7 after a bill to dissolve parliament and call for early elections failed. 

This is more than a momentary victory: under Israeli law, the bill's failure means that no other proposal to dissolve the Knesset (parliament) can be introduced for six months, buying Netanyahu and his coalition some time.

NETANYAHU COALITION THREATENED BY CONSCRIPTION STANDOFF WITH RELIGIOUS PARTIES

Ultra-Orthodox lawmakers had threatened to dissolve the government amid a deadlock over exemptions to military service. According to the Associated Press, most of the ultra-Orthodox members of the Knesset agreed to vote against the bill after reaching a compromise with MK Yuli Edelstein, who leads the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Discussions about the new draft law will reportedly continue over the coming week.

Edelstein has been a vocal opponent of any bill that would enshrine the ultra-Orthodox military service exemption into Israeli law, according to the Times of Israel.

NETANYAHU ACCUSES ISRAELI POLICE OF TRYING TO 'TOPPLE' HIS GOVERNMENT

While Israel requires citizens to enlist in the military at age 18, several groups are exempt—including the ultra-Orthodox community, also known as Haredim—which makes up roughly 13% of Israeli society, according to the Associated Press.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have Haredi units, which allow soldiers to follow religious traditions more strictly than other parts of the army. However, many Haredim choose to study Torah instead.

Opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yair Lapid said the government "spat in the faces" of Israeli soldiers and "sold out our troops" with the compromise, the Times of Israel reported. The outlet added that Edelstein stated that the only way to get an "effective bill like this leading to an expansion of the IDF's conscription base" would be through his committee.

The issue of religious exemption has been a debate among Israelis for decades, but it has become especially heated since Hamas' Oct. 7 massacre.

Israel is currently fighting the longest war in its history as the country marks 20 months of its ground operation in Gaza. Israelis from all walks of life have been called up to the reserves throughout the war, fueling frustration with the Haredi community's exemption.

Republican Governor of Indiana Mike Braun touches on his Freedom and Opportunity agenda including leading in school choice and bringing the 'MAHA' movement to his state, and his wife Maureen Braun shares her experience of becoming an IMS Princess.

President Donald Trump and Republicans in the House and Senate on Thursday finally ended California's outsized authority to dictate national emissions standards for new cars, trucks, RVs and engines. 

This win is another step toward rebuilding American manufacturing strength. 

The EPA, under President Joe Biden, granted California exemption waivers to the Clean Air Act, handing California the keys to set their own extreme emissions regulations – including the requirement that nearly all vehicles sold in the state must be electric by 2035.

Knowing that the people's representatives in Congress would reject their most extreme policies, the Biden administration had to rely on these workarounds to push their Green New Scam agenda. 

CALIFORNIA'S GREEN NEW SCAM COULD COST YOU $20,000

Biden's Clean Air Act waiver allowed other states to follow California's lead, creating a patchwork of misguided rules. More than a dozen states and D.C. follow California's standards, drastically changing the dynamics of America's critical auto and RV manufacturing industry without Congress having a say. 

In practice, this means California effectively set the standards for the automotive industry, and most Americans have been forced to live under a regulatory framework that none of our representatives ever voted on. 

This ends now. Rep. Yakym, R-Ind., along with House Republicans, took action to end this power grab, passing three disapproval resolutions under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal the EPA waivers. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., shepherded these three measures through the Senate, which today earned President Trump's signature.

Republicans across the country knew there was no time to waste. Beginning this year, California's Advanced Clean Trucks regulations would have started requiring new heavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks and RVs, to be zero-emission. This regulation threatened the RV supply chain by limiting the availability of chassis for motor homes.

THE PREDICTABLE OUTCOME OF CALIFORNIA'S GREEN ENERGY POLICIES HAS ARRIVED AND IT'S A DISASTER

Eleven states and D.C. adopted this mandate, which impacts 25% of the heavy-duty vehicle market in the United States, essentially making it the new national standard. 

The stakes couldn't be higher for the Hoosier State, especially Indiana's Second District, home to Rep. Yakym and the RV Capital of the World, where nearly 90% of America's RVs are built. This industry directly supports more than 60,000 Hoosier jobs, pays over $4.3 billion in wages, and generates a total economic output of $22 billion across the state. 

RV production is also critical to many other states which is why 13 Democrats joined Republicans in the bipartisan, commonsense vote against the Biden EPA's RV waiver. 

Reversing California's emissions power grab is essential to RV, automotive and engine manufacturing industries in the state of Indiana and across America.

The Clean Air Act was never intended to effectively give one state the power to dictate emissions standards for entire industries across the country. Congress prohibited states from establishing separate vehicle and engine regulations except under "compelling and extraordinary conditions" that apply specifically to that state. 

We've seen this before. As a U.S. senator, Gov. Braun used the Congressional Review Act to stop Biden's vaccine mandate for private businesses, a fight that ended with the Supreme Court striking it down. The CRA exists for moments like this, an expedited option to rein in the executive branch, reverse unnecessary red tape and prohibit substantially similar EPA actions in the future.

Hardworking Hoosiers shouldn't have to bear the weight of federal overreach. National rules should be set by the people's elected representatives, not by unelected regulators or one state's agenda.

Ending this EPA-California backroom deal will protect American jobs, unlock our full manufacturing potential, and ensure the shift to electric vehicles is driven by innovation and consumer choice, not bureaucrats in Washington or Los Angeles.

We applaud Republicans in the House and Senate and President Trump for taking a strong stand against the previous administration's Green New Deal overreach. The result will be stronger American manufacturing of cars, trucks, RVs and engines.

Mayor Lisa Brown declared a state of emergency after protesters failed to cooperate with a curfew. (KAYU-TV)

Spokane, Washington, has now declared a state of emergency after protesters failed to cooperate with Mayor Lisa Brown's curfew that began at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday until 5 a.m.

Brown issued the curfew amid ICE protests downtown from Boone Avenue to Spokane Falls Boulevard and Howard Street to Division Street, as well as Riverfront Park.

The protests began after former Spokane City Councilman Ben Stuckart issued a call to action asking for support for the detainment of a Venezuelan man seeking asylum.

"ACTION ALERT: Three weeks ago I became the legal guardian to a young man from Venezuela seeking asylum. He has turned in all paperwork and has a future court hearing. I went with him to ICE check in today. They detained him and are shipping him to Tacoma," his post read. "I am asking that if you care at all about these illegal detainers you meet me at 411 West Cataldo by 2pm. I am going to sit in front of the bus. Feel free to join me…….The Latino community needs the rest of our community now. Not tonight, not Saturday but right now!!!!"

Stuckart became the legal guardian of the 21-year-old Venezuelan man three weeks ago. 

Spokane Police Department and the county sheriff's office are currently on the scene and are also calling the gathering unlawful. 

Spokane County Commissioner Josh Kerns issued a statement referencing the two active riots in the City of Spokane.

"The unrest we have seen in the City of Spokane is unacceptable," said Kerns. "I stand with the dedicated men and women of law enforcement who put themselves in harm's way to protect lives, businesses and public safety." He continued, "Thank you to our police officers, deputies and their families tonight. We support you and have your back".

Kerns also stated, "I strongly support every American's First Amendment right to speak freely and protest peacefully – but that right does not include violence, obstruction of law enforcement, destruction of property or putting others at risk. We must uphold both our freedoms and our responsibility to exercise them lawfully."

DOZENS OF ANTI-ICE RIOTERS ARRESTED IN LA AS TRUMP SENDS IN NATIONAL GUARD TO QUELL VIOLENCE

Brown also released a statement on the gathering.

"I am aware of the situation unfolding outside of the Federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Spokane. The City of Spokane respects and upholds everyone's First Amendment rights and right to be on public property.  

Crowds disperse as police deploy tear gas.  (KAYU-TV)

"I encourage everyone to remain peaceful and safe, and my heart goes out to families being separated. Our unity is stronger than any attempt to divide us."  

Several protesters have been taken into custody on "failure to disperse" charge and SPD has deployed tear gas on the crowd.

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — Days before his arrest outside his daughter's house in the outskirts of San Salvador, constitutional lawyer Enrique Anaya called Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele a “dictator” and a “despot” on live TV.

This week, lawyer Jaime Quintanilla stood outside a detention facility in El Salvador's capital with a box of food and clothes for his client, unsure if Anaya would ever be released.

The Saturday arrest of Anaya, a fierce critic of Bukele, marks the latest move in what watchdogs describe as a wave of crackdown on dissent by the Central American leader. They say Bukele is emboldened by his alliance with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has not only praised him but avoided criticizing actions human rights defenders, international authorities and legal experts deem authoritarian.

Authorities in El Salvador have targeted outspoken lawyers like Anaya, journalists investigating Bukele's alleged deals with gangs and human rights defenders calling for the end of a three-year state of emergency, which has suspended fundamental civil rights. Some say they have been forced to flee the country.

“They're trying to silence anyone who voices an opinion — professionals, ideologues, anyone who is critical — now they're jailed.” Quintanilla said. “It's a vendetta.”

Bukele's office did not respond to a request for comment.




Observers see a worrisome escalation by the popular president, who enjoys extremely high approval ratings due to his crackdown on the country's gangs. By suspending fundamental rights, Bukele has severely weakened gangs but also locked up 87,000 people for alleged gang ties, often with little evidence or due process. A number of those detained were also critics.

Bukele and his New Ideas party have taken control of all three branches of government, stacking the country's Supreme Court with loyalists. Last year, in a move considered unconstitutional, he ran for reelection, securing a resounding victory.

“I don't care if you call me a dictator,” Bukele said earlier this month in a speech. “Better that than seeing Salvadorans killed on the streets.”

In recent weeks, those who have long acted as a thorn in Bukele's side say looming threats have reached an inflection point. The crackdown comes as Bukele has garnered global attention for keeping some 200 Venezuelan deportees detained in a mega-prison built for gangs as part of an agreement with the Trump administration.

Anaya was detained by authorities on unproven accusations of money laundering. Prosecutors said he would be sent to “relevant courts” in the coming days. Quintanilla, his lawyer, rejects the allegations, saying his arrest stems from years of vocally questioning Bukele.

Quintanilla, a longtime colleague of Anaya, said he decided to represent his friend in part because many other lawyers in the country were now too afraid to show their faces. On Tuesday, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed “deep concern” over Anaya's arrest.

Anaya, 61, is a respected lawyer and commentator in El Salvador with a doctorate in constitutional law. He has criticized Bukele's crackdown on the gangs and Bukele stacking of El Salvador's high court. Last year, he was among those who unsuccessfully petitioned the country's top electoral authority to reject Bukele's re-election bid, saying it violated the constitution.

Days before his arrest, Anaya railed on television against the detention of human rights lawyer Ruth López, who last week shouted, “They're not going to silence me, I want a public trial,” as police escorted her shackled to court.

“Of course I'm scared,” Anaya told the broadcast anchor. “I think that anyone here who dares to speak out, speaks in fear.”

While some of Bukele's most vocal critics, like Anaya and López, have been publicly detained, other human rights defenders have quietly slipped out of the country, hoping to seek asylum elsewhere in the region. They declined to comment or be identified out of fear that they would be targeted even outside El Salvador.

Last month, a protest outside of Bukele's house was violently quashed by police and some of the protesters arrested. He also ordered the arrest of the heads of local bus companies for defying his order to offer free transport while a major highway was blocked.

In late May, El Salvador's Congress passed a “foreign agents” law, championed by the populist president. It resembles legislation implemented by governments in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Russia, Belarus and China to silence and criminalize dissent by exerting pressure on organizations that rely on overseas funding.

Verónica Reyna, a human rights coordinator for the Salvadoran nonprofit Servicio Social Pasionista, said police cars now regularly wait outside her group's offices as a lingering threat.

“It's been little-by-little,” Reyna said. “Since Trump came to power, we've seen (Bukele) feel like there's no government that's going to strongly criticize him or try to stop him.”

Trump's influence extends beyond his vocal backing of Bukele, with his administration pushing legal boundaries to push his agenda, Reyna, other human rights defenders and journalists said.

The U.S. Embassy in El Salvador, which once regularly denounced the government's actions, has remained silent throughout the arrests and lingering threats. It did not respond to a request for comment. In its final year, the Biden administration, too, dialed back its criticism of the Bukele government as El Salvador's government helped slow migration north in the lead up to the 2024 election.

On Tuesday, Quintanilla visited Anaya in detention for the first time since his arrest while being watched by police officers.

Despite the detention, neither Anaya nor Quintanilla have been officially informed of the charges. Quintanilla worries that authorities will use wide ranging powers granted to Bukele by the “state of emergency” to keep him imprisoned indefinitely.

Óscar Martínez, editor-in-chief of news site El Faro, and four other journalists have left the country and are unable to return safely, as they face the prospect of arrest stemming from their reporting.

At a time when many other reporters have fallen silent out of fear, Martínez's news site has investigated Bukele more rigorously than perhaps any other, exposing hidden corruption and human rights abuses under his crackdown on gangs.

In May, El Faro published a three-part interview with a former gang leader who claimed he negotiated with Bukele's administration. Soon after, Martínez said the organization received news that authorities were preparing an arrest order for a half-dozen of their journalists. This has kept at least five El Faro journalists, including Martínez, stranded outside their country for over a month.

On Saturday, when the reporters tried to return home on a flight, a diplomatic source and a government official informed them that police had been sent to the airport to wait for them and likely arrest them.

The journalists later discovered that their names, along with other civil society leaders, appeared on a list of “priority objectives” held by airport authorities. Martínez said Anaya's name was also on the list.

Now in a nearby Central American nation, Martínez said he doesn't know when he will be able to board another flight home. And if he does, he doesn't know what will happen when he steps off.

“We fear that, if we return — because some of us surely will try — we'll be imprisoned,” he said. “I am positive that if El Faro journalists are thrown in prison, we'll be tortured and, possibly, even killed.”

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A federal court hearing is scheduled for Thursday on whether the Trump administration can use the National Guard and Marines to assist with immigration raids in Los Angeles.

California Gov. Newsom has depicted the federal military intervention in the nation's second largest city as the onset of a much broader effort by Trump to overturn political and cultural norms at the heart of the nation's democracy. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has echoed that, saying the deployment of troops was unnecessary and meant to undermine local jurisdictions and intimidate the city's large immigrant population. 

Newsom filed an emergency motion requesting the court's intervention after President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of roughly 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles following protests over his stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws.

The Trump administration called the lawsuit a “crass political stunt endangering American lives” in its official response on Wednesday.

The Democratic governor argued the troops were originally deployed to protect federal buildings and said sending troops to help support immigration raids would only promote civil unrest. 

The protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles intensified after Trump called up the National Guard and have since spread to other cities, including Boston, Chicago and Seattle. 




Federal immigration agents have been arresting people at Home Depot parking lots and other businesses, sparking fear in immigrant communities, after the Trump administration said it wanted to dramatically increase arrests under its immigration crackdown.




Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.

Most demonstrations have been peaceful but this weekend some turned raucous with protesters setting cars on fire in downtown Los Angeles. The city has imposed a nightly curfew covering a 1-square-mile (2.5-square-kilometer) section where protests have occurred in the sprawling metropolis of 4 million people. 

The Marines have not yet been spotted in Los Angeles and Guard troops have had limited engagement with protesters. 

Newsom filed the motion Tuesday, the same day the military announced some members of the National Guard were now standing in protection around federal agents. The change moves troops closer to engaging in law enforcement actions like deportations as Trump has promised as part of his administration's immigration crackdown. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers but any arrests ultimately would be made by law enforcement.

Senior U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer chose not to rule immediately but set the hearing for Thursday in federal court in San Francisco.

Dozens of mayors from across the Los Angeles region banded together Wednesday to demand the raids stop and the troops leave.

Former ABC News journalist Terry Moran has announced his transition to independent journalism by launching a Substack newsletter, following his recent departure from the network. Moran's move aligns him with a growing trend of former legacy media personalities seeking a new stream of revenue.

In a video shared on social media, Moran addressed his audience.

“Hello everyone, I'm Terry Moran, and for almost 28 years I was a reporter and anchor for ABC News,” he said in the video. “And as you may have heard, I'm not there anymore. I'm here with you on Substack, this amazing space, and I can't wait to get at it, to get at the important work that we all have to do in this time of such trouble for our country.”

Moran's departure from ABC News came after he posted a controversial comment on social media, referring to President Donald Trump and his adviser Stephen Miller as “world-class haters.”

“Trump is a world-class hater,” he posted on his X account. “But his hatred only a means to an end, and that end his his own glorification. That's his spiritual nourishment.”

ABC News cited a violation of its policies on objectivity and professionalism as the reason for his dismissal.

“We are at the end of our agreement with Terry Moran and based on his recent post — which was a clear violation of ABC News policies — we have made the decision to not renew,” an ABC spokesperson said.

Moran's transition to Substack places him among several high-profile journalists who have recently left legacy media outlets to pursue independent platforms. Notable figures in this shift include former CNN anchor Jim Acosta and former MSNBC host Joy Reid.

Rep. August Pfluger (R-TX) stepped up for the Republicans when they needed it in Wednesday night's Congressional Baseball Game against the Democrats at Nationals Park.

In the top of the first inning, with Democrats loading the bases and threatening to gain the upper hand early, Pfluger spotted a rocket down the third base line and acted. The 47-year-old congressman stretched out his glove to snag the ball, stood up, and dove for third base with a Democratic runner inbound.

Pfluger got the final out, fist pumping as he stranded several Democrats on base with the Republicans riding the momentum to a 13-2 win over the opposing party. The win is the GOP's fifth straight in the rivalry.

The Congressional Baseball Game is a long-running annual tradition between the parties. It has been played since 1909, and the Republicans hold the all-time record.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said before the game that they sold over 30,000 tickets and raised around $2.79 million for charity.

Rep. Roger Williams (R-TX), a former player in the Atlanta Braves minor league system, coached the Republicans, while Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-CA) led the Democrats. Before the game, Williams sardonically emphasized scoring more runs than the other team, while Sanchez believed their freshman newcomers could make a difference.

After Pfluger's camera-snapping catch, the Republicans took advantage. They grabbed five runs in the first two innings as pitcher Rep. Chris DeLuzio (D-PA) lost control of his command in the second.

While the Democrats knocked in a pair of runs in the third inning to keep it competitive at 5-2, the GOP piled on another eight runs in the fifth and sixth innings to seal the game at 13-2.

Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL), who said he threw seven strikeouts in the game, said after that he wished they would have hit the ball better but acknowledged they turned it up in the fifth and sixth innings. He added that Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN), who played right field and caught a ball near the end of the game, was the most valuable player.

Steube knows what he will do after the game, which saw both teams' mostly middle-aged participants dart around the diamond for seven innings.

“I am going to take an ice bath tomorrow,” he said.

            David Hogg will not seek reelection to his Democratic National Committee leadership position after the party announced Wednesday that members had voted to redo the vice chair contests he and Malcolm Kenyatta won in February.
    


            “Ultimately, I have decided to not run in this upcoming election so the party can focus on what really matters,” Hogg said in a statement.
    


            Hogg's decision not to run again ends a monthslong intraparty fight between the young gun control advocate and much of the national committee that has distracted from the party's efforts to rebuild after devastating 2024 election losses.
    


            The outgoing vice chair has accused party leaders of attempting to oust him from his position over frustration with his plan to primary “ineffective” Democratic incumbents in safe seats through his PAC Leaders We Deserve.
    


            DNC members have argued that Hogg has mischaracterized the vote. The initial challenge to how the committee handled the February 1 vote for two vice chair positions was made in late February, months before Hogg announced his primary initiative.
    


            Still, members' feelings toward Hogg and his ongoing, public dispute with party leaders loomed large over the vote. The proposal to hold a new election passed 75% to 25% with 89% of DNC members participating.
    


            DNC chairman Ken Martin praised Hogg for his work on the committee.
    


            “I commend David for his years of activism, organizing, and fighting for his generation, and while I continue to believe he is a powerful voice for this party, I respect his decision to step back from his post as Vice Chair,” Martin said in a statement. “I have no doubt that he will remain an important advocate for Democrats across the map.”
    


            Had Hogg run again, he would have faced Kenyatta in an election for a position which, under the DNC's gender parity rules, must go to a man.
    


            “I'm grateful to the overwhelming support I've received in this reelection from DNC members and I look forward to getting back to work electing Democrats up and down the ballot,” Kenyatta said in a statement. “I wish David the best.”
    


            Voting for the other vice chair seat will run from Sunday morning through Tuesday afternoon. Three female candidates who were in the running in February will be eligible: Kalyn Free, an Oklahoma Democratic activist who filed the challenge, as well as Kansas state party chair Jeanna Repass and Washington state party chair Shasti Conrad.
    


            Separately, the DNC is also weighing a new proposal put forth by Martin that would officially require elected party leaders to stay neutral in primaries. The DNC is expected to vote on that measure at an August meeting.

Police handcuffed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., and pushed him to the ground Thursday after forcibly removing him from a press conference Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was holding in Los Angeles.

Padilla had entered the room and interrupted Noem as she was speaking about her department's plans to continue deportation efforts in California, even as the Trump administration's recent immigration enforcement operations have stirred a wave of protests.

The senator said after the incident that he was not arrested or detained. DHS blamed Padilla for the altercation, but said he and Noem later held a 15-minute meeting.

Video shared with NBC News' Jacob Soboroff by Padilla's staff shows two officers pulling the senator by the arms after he enters the room.

"I am Senator Alex Padilla," he says as the officers push him toward an exit and he pushes back with his body, the video shows.

"I have questions for the secretary, because the fact of the matter is, a half a dozen violent criminals that you're rotating on your, on your," Padilla says before being overwhelmed by multiple officers and shoved out of the room.

The video shows Padilla is then moved to a hallway where three officers put him on his knees, push him onto his stomach and order him to put his hands behind his back before handcuffing him.

A voice is then heard on the video saying that no recording is allowed in the hallway.

Padilla, speaking to reporters later Thursday, vowed to hold the Trump administration accountable.

"If this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they're doing to farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers throughout the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country," he said.

Padilla's office said in a statement that the seantor was in LA to exercise "his duty to perform Congressional oversight of the federal government's operations in Los Angeles and across California."

"He was in the federal building to receive a briefing with General Guillot and was listening to Secretary Noem's press conference," the statement said. "He tried to ask the Secretary a question, and was forcibly removed by federal agents, forced to the ground and handcuffed."

DHS defended the officers' actions and accused Padilla of engaging in "disrespectful political theatre."

The senator "interrupted a live press conference without identifying himself or having his Senate security pin on as he lunged toward Secretary Noem," the department said in a statement on X.

The video shows Padilla did verbally identify himself as a senator prior to his removal.

DHS added that Padilla "did not comply with officers' repeated commands" to back away. 

It also claimed that U.S. Secret Service agents "thought he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately."

Nevertheless, "Secretary Noem met with Senator Padilla after and held a 15 minute meeting," DHS said.

The video instantly sparked outrage from Democrats.

"I just saw something that sickened my stomach: The manhandling of a United States senator," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the floor of his chamber. 

"We need immediate answers to what the hell went on," Schumer said.

"What just happened to @SenAlexPadilla is absolutely abhorrent and outrageous," Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass wrote on X.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has clashed with President Donald Trump over his administration's immigration operations in LA, wrote, "If they can handcuff a U.S. Senator for asking a question, imagine what they will do to you."

Trump's Immigration Policy:

US ICE agents detain a suspect during a multi-agency targeted enforcement operation in Lyons, Illinois, on Jan. 26.

President Donald Trump conceded that his immigration crackdown was hurting US businesses and said policy changes covering farmworkers and the hotel industry will be made to address worker shortages. 

“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “Changes are coming.”

The Senate on Thursday confirmed Billy Long as the next IRS Commissioner, which could mark a shift for taxpayers amid sweeping agency cuts.

Picked by President Donald Trump, the former Missouri Congressman's nomination received mixed support from Washington and the tax community. But Senate Republicans confirmed Long via a party-line vote.

During the confirmation process, Long faced Democratic scrutiny over Trump loyalties and ties to dubious tax credits, among other questions, which he addressed during a May Senate Finance Committee hearing and written testimony.

When asked about Trump's power over the agency during the May Senate hearing, Long said: "The IRS will not, should not be politicized on my watch."

In written testimony, Long said he would "follow the law" when asked for specifics about how he would respond to political favor requests from Trump.

"The confirmation process was pretty controversial," said Carl Tobias, law professor at University of Richmond's School of Law.

But it's currently unclear what Long as IRS Commissioner will mean for taxpayers, he said.

Long's confirmation comes amid widespread IRS cuts from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.

The hiring freeze, deferred resignation programs and reductions in force "will have significant impacts" on IRS operations, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, or TIGTA, said in a June 6 report.

A separate TIGTA report from May found the agency had lost nearly one-third of its so-called revenue agents, who conduct audits, as of March 2025.

The "tax gap" — federal levies incurred but not paid voluntarily on time — was estimated at $696 billion for tax year 2022, according to the latest IRS data.

When asked about the tax gap, Long answered in written testimony: "My goal is to modernize and streamline the IRS, so we are collecting the maximum amount owed each year."

Meanwhile, Trump's fiscal 2026 budget request calls for a 37% reduction in IRS spending, including staffing and technology cuts. These reductions could impact revenue collections, according to a Budget Lab at Yale analysis.

In a May House Appropriations subcommittee hearing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said "collections" were among his IRS priorities. He said "smarter IT" and the "AI boom" could help meet revenue goals.

In 2022, Congress approved nearly $80 billion in IRS funding, with more than half earmarked for enforcement of corporate and high-net-worth tax dodgers. That funding has since been targeted by Republicans.

As the agency faces cuts, it could also soon see more administrative work once Republicans enact sweeping tax changes via Trump's big beautiful spending bill.

For example, one provision would require precertification of each qualifying child for filers claiming the earned income tax credit. This could be challenging amid staffing cuts, experts say.

Tune in to CNBC all week for ongoing coverage of this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list.

In this article

Chime opened at $43 in its Nasdaq debut on Thursday after selling shares at $27 each in an IPO that valued the online banking company at $11.6 billion.

Late Wednesday, Chime raised about $700 million in its offering, and existing investors sold an additional $165 million worth of shares. The stock is trading under the ticker symbol CHYM.

Chime's initial public offering, from a valuation perspective, represents a big step down from where venture investors like Sequoia Capital valued the company in its last fundraising round in 2021, when private tech markets were raging. The valuation at the time was $25 billion.

Still, Chime's offering is the latest sign that the fintech IPO market is opening up after a multi-year freeze brought on by rising interest rates and valuation resets. Recent debuts from eToro and crypto company Circle have rekindled optimism in the sector, with both stocks seeing strong initial pops.

Chime reported $518.7 million in revenue for the most recent quarter, a 32% increase from a year earlier. Net income narrowed slightly to $12.9 million, down from $15.9 million in the same period last year.

CEO Chris Britt said Chime has built a loyal user base by serving Americans earning $100,000 a year or less, a group often overlooked by traditional banks.

"Two-thirds of our customer base use us as their direct deposit account and primary account relationship," Britt told CNBC's David Faber. "We help our members avoid fees, get access to short-term liquidity, build their credit and build their savings — and it's that combination of services that really resonates and matters most to the everyday consumer."

Britt said the company reached $25 million in adjusted profitability in the first quarter and has improved its adjusted profit margin by 40 points over the past two years.

The company's top institutional shareholders are DST Global and Crosslink Capital. Iconiq was one of the firms that invested six years ago, when Chime raised money at a $1.5 billion valuation.

"We first invested in Chime in 2019 and continued to invest through subsequent rounds because of their singular, unwavering focus on serving everyday Americans — and the trust they've built with that core customer base," Yoonkee Sull, general partner at Iconiq, said in an interview.

The average Chime customer completes more than 55 transactions per month using the Chime card and interacts with the app four to five times a day. Active member growth rose 23% in the first quarter from a year earlier, Britt said, with 8.6 million monthly active users and an increasing number turning to Chime to serve as their primary banking relationship.

Customer acquisition doesn't come cheap. Chime disclosed in its prospectus that it spent $1.4 billion on marketing between 2022 and 2024. Britt said the retention rate is above 90% once users set up direct deposit.

"Sometimes for people, it takes a change in life — a change in their career, a job change — to be the point in time when they actually make the switch and use us as a primary bank account," he said.

The company's core revenue comes from interchange fees, the charges merchants pay when consumers swipe Chime-issued debit or credit cards. Britt said 72% of Chime's revenue is payments driven, versus traditional banks that rely heavily on fees from overdrafts and minimum balances.

"It's pretty simplistic," said Dan Dolev, an analyst at Mizuho. "I'm actually surprised by how unsophisticated that business model is."

Chime's performance in the public markets may set the tone for what comes next. Several other fintech players, including Klarna, Gemini and Bullish, have already filed for IPOs publicly or confidentially.

"If it goes well — and you'll know that in the next two to three months — I think you'll see much more receptivity" from other companies in the pipeline, said David Golden, partner at Revolution Ventures and former head of tech investment banking at JPMorgan Chase.

"If it doesn't go well," Golden added, "I think they'll continue just to sit on their hands and wait it out."

Chime is a five-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company, having made the annual list from 2020-2024.

Air India Crash:

The crash site of Air India Ltd. Flight 171 in Ahmedabad, India, on June 12.

US President Donald Trump expressed his condolences after the deadly crash of a Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner operated by Air India that left hundreds dead, saying he had offered “pointers” on possible causes as well as an offer of assistance to Indian authorities.

“I gave them a couple of pointers. I said, ‘Maybe you look at this,' you know, we saw the plane, it looked like it was flying pretty well, it didn't look like there was an explosion, just looked like the engines maybe lost power,” Trump said at an event Thursday at the White House.

Oracle shares soared 15% on Thursday and headed for a record close and their best day since 2021, after the database software vendor issued robust earnings and a strong forecast, fueled by growth in cloud.

Revenue climbed 11% year over year during the fiscal fourth quarter to $15.9 billion, topping the $15.59 billion average estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 exceeded the average analyst estimate of $1.64.

"All told, ORCL has entered an entirely new wave of enterprise popularity that it has not seen since the Internet era in the late 90s," Piper Sandler analysts wrote in a note to clients. The firm was one of several to lift its price target on the stock, raising its prediction to $190 from $130.

Oracle has been making headway in the cloud infrastructure market to challenge Amazon, Google and Microsoft. It's still small by comparison, with $3 billion in cloud revenue during the May quarter, compared with over $12 billion for Google, which counts productivity software subscriptions and cloud infrastructure sales when reporting cloud metrics. But Oracle's business is growing faster.

Future expansion can also come from sales of Oracle's database on clouds other than its own.

"The growth rate in multi-cloud is astonishing," Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said on Wednesday's conference call with analysts. "In other words, our database is now moving very rapidly to the cloud, I think because – a few reasons, because the database has now all these AI capabilities, but also, quite frankly, now people can get it in whatever cloud they want."

Remaining performance obligations, a measurement of money that's expected to be recognized as revenue in the future, sat at $138 billion, up 41% from a year earlier. Oracle CEO Safra Catz said RPO will likely more than double in the 2026 fiscal year, which ends in May 2026. Revenue for the new fiscal year should come in above $67 billion, she said. That's higher than LSEG's $65.18 billion consensus.

Gains from OpenAI's Stargate artificial intelligence data center project, targeting $500 billion in investments over four years, are not yet included in forecasts.

"If Stargate turns out to be, everything is advertised, then we've understated our RPO growth," Ellison said.

For fiscal 2029, revenue should be above the $104 billion target the company set in September, Catz said.

Still, the company faces the challenge of meeting client demand in cloud. 

"Demand continues to dramatically outstrip supply," Catz said, though she added that the company isn't having trouble sourcing Nvidia graphics processing units.

Analysts at RBC, who recommend holding the stock, raised their price target to $195 to $145. But they noted that, "with the backdrop of continued capacity constraints, we struggle to see a path to meaningful acceleration in the near term."

A Tesla Inc. Optimus robot at the Paris Motor Show in Paris, on Oct. 15.

Tesla Inc. sued a former engineer with the company's highly secretive Optimus program, accusing him of stealing confidential information about the humanoid robot and setting up a rival startup in Silicon Valley. 

Zhongjie “Jay” Li worked at Tesla between August 2022 and September 2024, according to a complaint filed in a San Francisco Federal Court late Wednesday. Li worked on “advanced robotic hand sensors—and was entrusted with some of the most sensitive technical data in the program,” Tesla's lawyers said in the complaint.

President Donald Trump ripped Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as a "numbskull" on Thursday as he turned up the heat on the central bank chief to lower interest rates.

Trump claimed at the White House that lowering rates by 2 percentage points would save the U.S. $600 billion per year, "but we can't get this guy to do it."

"We're going to spend $600 billion a year, $600 billion because of one numbskull that sits here [and says] 'I don't see enough reason to cut the rates now,'" Trump said.

Trump added that he was OK with the Fed raising rates if inflation was going up.

"But it's down," he said, "and I may have to force something."

Trump's insult came hours after the Labor Department reported that U.S. producer prices rose less in May than some economists anticipated.

That and other recent economic readings have calmed some fears about a sudden tariff-induced inflation spike — and galvanized Trump and his allies to ramp up pressure on the Fed.

Trump's latest attack on Powell was the third time in two days that a member of his administration has targeted the central bank leader.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Wednesday night, "It's unbelievable how much we would save if [Powell] did his job and he cut interest rates."

"The economy is ready for it. It's easy. Inflation is low," Lutnick said on Fox News. "Come on. He's got to do his job soon."

Earlier Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance wrote in a social media post, "the refusal by the Fed to cut rates is monetary malpractice."

Markets were mostly unmoved by Trump's remarks, which continued his recent efforts to brand Powell with the nickname "Too Late."

Traders have priced in virtually no chance that the Fed will cut rates following its meeting next week, and little chance of a move at its July gathering.

Traders did assign a stronger chance of a cut in September, with odds running at about 76% on Thursday, compared with 69% a day ago, according to CME Group data.

Investors were spooked in April when Trump appeared to be considering an attempt to fire Powell before his term expires next year. The president backed off following a bout of market volatility, and has not threatened to fire Powell since then.

Trump in Thursday's remarks repeated that he is "not going to fire" Powell, but added, "I don't know why it would be so bad."

Powell has said that the law does not permit the president to fire him, and the Supreme Court suggested in May that Fed governors have more protection against termination than other federal agency heads.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

The US stock market is back on track and within spitting distance of February's all-time highs. Yet corporate executives are dumping shares at the fastest clip since November.

A gauge of insider sentiment, which tracks the numbers of buyers versus sellers, shows that 200 insiders bought shares this month through June 11, while 778 sold shares, according to data compiled by the Washington Service. That puts the buy to sell ratio at around 0.26, the lowest since November when Trump's reelection triggered a months-long rally.

President Donald Trump on Thursday is signing three congressional resolutions that target California's statewide efforts to adopt electric vehicles and phase out diesel engines and the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035.

California's plan had been adopted by 11 other states.

"It's been a disaster for this country," Trump said at the White House.

"We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California's electric vehicle mandate," Trump said.

"And they're never coming back."

General Motors and Toyota had lobbied against California's rules.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, during the Biden administration, in December granted California a waiver allowing a mandate that most automotive sales in the state be electric vehicles.

"Under the previous administration, the federal government gave left-wing radicals in California dictatorial powers to control the future of the entire car industry, all over the country, all over the world, actually," Trump said. "Because they have to build a car, they can't build 19 different cars called the same thing."

California Gov. Gavin Newsom in May blasted the resolutions undoing the plan.

"Big polluters and the right-wing propaganda machine have succeeded in buying off the Republican Party," Newsom said.

Britain's government is planning to ramp up public spending — but market watchers warn the proposals risk sending jitters through the bond market further inflating the country's $143 billion-a-year interest payments.

U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves on Wednesday announced the government would inject billions of pounds into defense, healthcare, infrastructure, and other areas of the economy, in the coming years. A day later, however, official data showed the U.K. economy shrank by a greater-than-expected 0.3% in April.

Funding public spending in the absence of a growing economy, leaves the government with two options: raise money through taxation, or take on more debt.

One way it can borrow is to issue bonds, known as gilts in the U.K., into the public market. By purchasing gilts, investors are essentially lending money to the government, with the yield on the bond representing the return the investor can expect to receive.

Gilt yields and prices move in opposite directions — so rising prices move yields lower, and vice versa. This year, gilt yields have seen volatile moves, with investors sensitive to geopolitical and macroeconomic instability.

The U.K. government's long-term borrowing costs spiked to multi-decade highs in January, and the yield on 20- and 30-year gilts continues to hover firmly above 5%.



Official estimates show the government is expected to spend more than £105 billion ($142.9 billion) paying interest on its national debt in the 2025 fiscal year — £9.4 billion higher than at the the time of the Autumn budget last year — and £111 billion in annual interest in 2026.

The government did not say on Wednesday how its newly unveiled spending hikes will be funded, and did not respond to CNBC's request for comment about where the money will come from. However, in her Autumn Budget last year, Reeves outlined plans to hike both taxes and borrowing. Following the budget, the finance minister pledged not to raise taxes again during the current Labour government's term in office, saying that the government "won't have to do a budget like this ever again."

Andrew Goodwin, chief U.K. economist at Oxford Economics, said Britain's government may be forced to go even further with its spending plans, with NATO poised to hike its defense spending target for member states to 5% of GDP, and once a U-turn on winter fuel payments for the elderly and other possible welfare reforms are factored in.

Additionally, Goodwin said, the U.K.'s Office for Budget Responsibility is likely to make "unfavorable revisions" to its economic forecasts in July, which would lead to lower tax receipts and higher borrowing.

"If recent movements in financial market pricing hold, debt servicing costs will be around £2.5bn ($3.4 billion) higher than they were at the time of the Spring Statement," Goodwin warned in a note on Wednesday.

Mel Stride, who serves as the shadow Chancellor in the U.K.'s opposition government, told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Thursday that the Spending Review raised questions about whether "a huge amount of borrowing" will be involved in funding the government's fiscal strategies.

"[Government] borrowing is having consequences in terms of higher inflation in the U.K. … and therefore interest rates [are] higher for longer," he said. "It's adding to the debt mountain, the servicing costs upon which are running at 100 billion [pounds] a year, that's twice what we spend on defense."

"I'm afraid the overall economy is in a very weak position to withstand the kind of spending and borrowing that this government is announcing," Stride added.

Stride argued that Reeves will "almost certainly" have to raise taxes again in her next budget announcement due in the autumn.

"We've ended up in a very fragile situation, particularly when you've got the tariffs around the world," he said.

Rufaro Chiriseri, head of fixed income for the British Isles at RBC Wealth Management, told CNBC that rising borrowing costs were putting Reeves' "already small fiscal headroom at risk."

"This reduced headroom could create a snowball effect, as investors could potentially become nervous to hold UK debt, which could lead to a further selloff until fiscal stability is restored," he said.

Iain Barnes, Chief Investment Officer at Netwealth, also told CNBC on Thursday that the U.K. was in "a state of fiscal fragility, so room for manoeuvre is limited."

"The market knows that if growth disappoints, then this year's Budget may have to deliver higher taxes and increased borrowing to fund spending plans," Barnes said.

However, April LaRusse, head of investment specialists at Insight Investment, argued there were ways for debt servicing burdens to be kept under control.

The U.K.'s Debt Management Office, which issues gilts, has scope to reshape issuance patters — the maturity and type of gilts issued — to help the government get its borrowing costs under control, she said.

"With the average yield on the 1-10 year gilts at c4% and the yield on the 15 year + gilts at 5.2% yield, there is scope to make the debt financing costs more affordable," she explained.

However, LaRusse noted that debt interest payments for the U.K. government were estimated to reach the equivalent of around 3.5% of GDP this fiscal year, and that overspending could worsen the burden.

"This increase is driven not only by higher interest rates, which gradually translate into higher coupon payments, but also by elevated levels of government spending, compounding the fiscal burden," she said.

Not every problem is fixable. You can't change a loved one's diagnosis or control the economy. But you can choose how you respond to life's challenges.

As a therapist who's studied mental strength for over 20 years, I've seen how people's problem-solving abilities shape their outcomes. Those who are convinced they're trapped stay helpless and hopeless. But those who believe there's a way forward, no matter how small, make progress.

You're never powerless in the face of problems. As I shared on a recent episode of my "Mentally Stronger" podcast, the way forward isn't always about getting more information or advice. It's about asking yourself the right questions. 

Here are five powerful questions mentally strong people use to tackle any problem:

Ask yourself, "On a scale of zero to 10, with 10 being my best, where am I right now? What can I do to move up one step?"

It's easy to think in extremes: This is awful. There's nothing I can do. But scaling the situation reframes your thinking and helps you see that things may not be as dismal as you imagine. It also shifts your focus toward small, actionable steps.

For example: You wake up feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. You rate your mood as a three. To boost it up to a four, you take a quick walk around the block and text a friend to schedule a coffee date. Those little actions help you feel a little better right away.

Reflect on moments when things weren't as overwhelming. What did you do differently? Drawing from past success shows you that progress is possible and gives you a blueprint to repeat.

For example: You feel stuck in another repetitive argument with your partner, this time over household responsibilities. But you recall how you had a healthy conversation a few months ago that helped you both feel more aligned. That memory sparks hope and a plan to have another open conversation.

This question reminds you that you've survived tough times, so you can do it again by relying on your inner strength. By focusing on your resilience and past successes — and identifying the specific tools and resources you used — you build confidence that you'll overcome current struggles, too.

For example: You're anxious about your financial situation after getting laid off. But reflecting on how you managed during a previous layoff reminds you of your adaptability. Picking up temporary work while planning your long-term next step worked then, and it can work now.

Sometimes, loved ones see your progress before you do. Think about what strengths a good friend would see in you, or how they might point out the progress you've made.

Imagining their perspective helps you identify your growth and encourage self-compassion. It's like borrowing optimism when you need it most.

For example: Your child is misbehaving again. You have to meet with the principal and miss even more work, which you can't afford to do. Just as you're feeling super stressed, you pause and think, "What would my best friend say?"

She'd applaud your mental strength and say, "You have the ability to stay calm during stressful times. I know you can take a breath, tell your boss what you need, speak to the principal, and figure out next steps with your kid."

When you feel powerless, it's easy to become passive and do nothing — or make things even worse. Remind yourself that at the very least, you have the power to take small steps now to ensure things don't get worse later. 

For example: You're in the middle of a painful breakup and feel tempted to text your ex. But you remember that reaching out would make things worse. That helps you stick to your commitment to prioritize things like exercise and journaling to manage your emotions.

GameStop shares slid Thursday after the video game retailer announced plans for a $1.75 billion convertible notes offering to potentially fund its new bitcoin purchase strategy. The company also said it would turn its focus toward the trading card market.

The retailer said it intends to use the net proceeds from the note offering for general corporate purposes, "including making investments in a manner consistent with GameStop's Investment Policy and potential acquisitions."

Part of the investment policy is to add cryptocurrencies to its balance sheet. Last month, GameStop bought 4,710 bitcoins, worth more than half a billion dollars.

The stock tanked more than 23% in afternoon trading.

GameStop is following in the footsteps of software company MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy, which bought billions of dollars worth of bitcoin in recent years to become the largest corporate holder of the flagship cryptocurrency. That decision prompted a rapid, albeit volatile, rise for Strategy's stock.

Strategy has issued various forms of securities including convertible debt to fund its bitcoin purchases.

CEO Ryan Cohen recently said GameStop's decision to buy bitcoin is driven by macro concerns as the digital coin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, could serve as protection against certain risks.

The brick-and-mortar retailer reported a decline in fiscal first-quarter revenue on Tuesday as demand for online gaming rose. Its revenue dropped 17% year over year to $732.4 million. 

The shares fell 5% on Wednesday after those results. Wall Street appears uncertain the video game retailer can mimic the success of MicroStrategy.

Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter reiterated his underperform rating on GameStop on Wednesday, saying the meme stock has consistently capitalized on "greater fools" willing to pay more than twice its asset value for its shares. The Wedbush analyst believes the bitcoin buying strategy makes little sense as the company, already trading at 2.4 times cash, isn't likely to drive an even greater premium by converting more cash to crypto.

Separately, Cohen said on Thursday at the company's annual meeting that GameStop is focusing on trading cards as "a natural extension" of its existing business, according to a transcript on FactSet. He said that this market is embedded in physical retail and has "high margin potential."

GameStop's collectibles revenue in the first quarter surged 54% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growing demand for trading cards – in particular, the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the company said.

Data tracker Circana said its March Omnibus survey revealed that 19% of adults have purchased Pokémon trading cards for themselves in the past six months. 

The majority are collecting the cards as a hobby or for decoration, Circana said. The firm added that adults have been helping to boost toy sales, with the demographic accounting for the highest spending among all age groups in the first quarter.

GameStop shares slid Thursday after the video game retailer announced plans for a $1.75 billion convertible notes offering to potentially fund its new bitcoin purchase strategy. The company also said it would turn its focus toward the trading card market.

The retailer said it intends to use the net proceeds from the note offering for general corporate purposes, "including making investments in a manner consistent with GameStop's Investment Policy and potential acquisitions."

Part of the investment policy is to add cryptocurrencies to its balance sheet. Last month, GameStop bought 4,710 bitcoins, worth more than half a billion dollars.

The stock tanked more than 23% in afternoon trading.

GameStop is following in the footsteps of software company MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy, which bought billions of dollars worth of bitcoin in recent years to become the largest corporate holder of the flagship cryptocurrency. That decision prompted a rapid, albeit volatile, rise for Strategy's stock.

Strategy has issued various forms of securities including convertible debt to fund its bitcoin purchases.

CEO Ryan Cohen recently said GameStop's decision to buy bitcoin is driven by macro concerns as the digital coin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, could serve as protection against certain risks.

The brick-and-mortar retailer reported a decline in fiscal first-quarter revenue on Tuesday as demand for online gaming rose. Its revenue dropped 17% year over year to $732.4 million.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Oil prices spiked overnight on geopolitical concerns, as U.S. President Donald Trump struck a sharply more negative tone over the progress of nuclear talks with Iran and announced the withdrawal of some American personnel from the Middle East. 

The developments mark a stark shift after several rounds of mostly indirect U.S.-Iran talks that were previously described as "positive" and "respectful."

Both the Trump administration and Iran have expressed their desire to strike a deal. For Trump, it would deliver a political and diplomatic win that the previous Biden administration failed to achieve. For Iran, it would mean desperately needed relief from sanctions that have crippled its economy.

It now looks increasingly unlikely.

"They [U.S. military personnel] are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place and we will see what happens. ... We have given notice to move out," Trump told reporters on Wednesday. The Pentagon ordered the withdrawal of troops and nonessential staff from embassies in Baghdad, Kuwait and Bahrain.

Speaking on a podcast with the New York Post, Trump on Wednesday accused Tehran of "delaying," saying "I'm less confident now than I would have been a couple of months ago."

Tehran, meanwhile, has accused Washington of not being serious in its engagement and not respecting Iran's right to enrich uranium for what it insists are peaceful purposes.

Trump has previously warned that the U.S. or Israel could carry out airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities if negotiations failed. In response, Iran's defense minister expressed hope for the talks, but also warned of military retaliation if things were to go south. 

"In that case, America will have to leave the region, because all of its bases are within our reach. We have access to them, and without hesitation, we will target all of them in the host countries," the minister told Iranian press.

On Thursday, meanwhile, the IAEA Board of Governors — the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog — passed a resolution declaring Iran in noncompliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations for the first time in nearly 20 years.

As it stands, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is set to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Oman on Sunday for further discussions.

Despite the ongoing talks, Israel is considering military action against Iran in the coming days, according to sources cited by NBC News.

The potential impact of a military conflict between Israel and Iran — a country of 93 million people that is nearly four times the size of Iraq — cannot be understated, both for the nations involved, and for global markets, political analysts and economists say.

However, multiple analysts speaking to CNBC say a military confrontation is still likely to be averted — for now. Some suggested that the recent partial evacuation orders are part of the choreography of pressure ahead of the upcoming U.S.-Iran nuclear talks. 

The No. 1 holdup to a deal? Domestic uranium enrichment in Iran, which can be used to generate nuclear energy for peaceful purposes — or build a bomb.

After initially showing flexibility on Iran being able to enrich uranium at lower levels for nuclear power generation, Trump has changed his tune, saying anything beyond zero enrichment in the country is unacceptable. 

That's a hard deal-breaker for Tehran, which demands its right to a civilian nuclear energy program. Iran maintains that right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, which it joined in 1970, and which allows nonnuclear weapon states to build peaceful nuclear energy programs.

But concerns abound over Iran's actual intentions. Under the 2015 Obama-era Iranian nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, Iran committed to capping levels of 3.67% enriched uranium at 300 kilograms — enough to sustain a civilian nuclear power program. 

But Iran's uranium enrichment has reached 60% purity, according to the IAEA — a dramatically higher level that is a short technical step from the weapons-grade purity level of 90%. "A country enriching at 60% is a very serious thing. Only countries making bombs are reaching this level," IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said in 2021. 

Despite Trump publicly saying any Iranian domestic enrichment at all represents a red line, a number of options have been floated that would provide a sort of "compromise" for Tehran. 

Those include the U.S. proposal that Iran join a regional nuclear consortium that would allow it to continue enriching uranium at low levels while committing to zero enrichment at some point in the future, and that would see it mothball — but not dismantle — its nuclear facilities.

But the U.S. proposal "is more a series of ideas than a concrete plan, and for the moment looks unworkable," Gregory Brew, senior Iran and energy analyst at Eurasia Group, wrote in a note this week. 

"Even if Iran is allowed to enrich on an interim basis, it will not accept an arrangement that does not safeguard this right in perpetuity."

In addition, the Iranians "are also quite irritated that the U.S. has not engaged substantively with the issue of sanctions relief," Brew said. "They are asking for clarification on that issue; the Iranians of course are chiefly interested in a deal that brings sanctions relief for their economy." 

The fact that Iran has openly threatened to directly strike U.S. assets in the region if attacked is tremendously significant, according to Trita Parsi, executive vice president at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. 

That's in large part because the missiles Iran deployed to strike Israel last October "actually were quite efficient," Parsi told CNBC's "Access Middle East" on Thursday. 

"If there is a confrontation, and if the Iranians make true on their threats to target American bases, this is going to end up becoming a very, very devastating confrontation," Parsi said. 

"And supporters of Trump from his own base are very worried that he will be jeopardizing his entire presidency over this issue, when in reality, there is a diplomatic deal in reach."

Crude oil futures fell slightly on Thursday, after spiking sharply in the previous session on fears that Israel and Iran are on the brink of war.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate fell 11 cents, or 0.16%, to close at $68.04 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent lost 41 cents, or 0.59%, to settle at $69.36 per barrel.Oil prices jumped more than 4% on Wednesday as fears of a conflict that would disrupt crude supplies suddenly swept the market.

Israel is considering taking military action against Iran without U.S. support in the coming days, five people with knowledge of the situation told NBC News. President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that an attack could happen, though he would not call it imminent.

"I don't want to say it's imminent but it looks like something that could very well happen," Trump said during an event at the White House. "Look, it's very simple, not complicated. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon."

The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, has ordered the departure of nonessential personnel from Iraq. The Pentagon authorized the voluntary departure of military members' families from the Middle East.

The departures come after Iran's defense minister warned that the Islamic Republic would strike U.S. bases across the region if a conflict breaks out.

Oil prices could spike to $120 per barrel or more if Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz in response to an Israeli strike, said Natasha Kaneva, head of global commodities research at JPMorgan.

Some 30% of the world's seaborne oil trade moves through the strait, according to JPMorgan. But the risk of an Iranian blockade is low, Kaneva told clients in a Thursday note.

"Crucially, for all of recorded history, despite many threats, the Strait of Hormuz has never been closed off. Crude oil continued to flow," she said.

NASA's car-sized Perseverance rover has been roaming the surface of Mars for four years, drilling into the alien soil to collect dirt it places in tubes and leaves on the ground.

Engineers designed Perseverance to be the first step in the agency's exploration of the Red Planet. In the future, more robotic spacecraft would arrive to sweep up the capsules and rocket them back to Earth, where scientists could look for signs that Mars once was, or is, a world with life.

Tune in to CNBC all week for ongoing coverage of this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list.

Gecko Robotics announced on Thursday that it raised $125 million in a Series D funding round, raising the AI and robotics company's valuation to $1.25 billion.

The new round of funding means the Pittsburgh-based company has reached unicorn status, roughly twelve years after it was founded by Jake Loosararian. The company's previous round of funding, a $173 million Series C in December 2023, valued it at $633 million.

To date, the company has raised $347 million from investors including USIT, XN, Founders Fund and Y Combinator. Its latest round was led by new investor Cox Enterprises.

Gecko Robotics, the two-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company, ranked No. 30 on the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list. It uses a variety of robots that can climb, fly and swim around critical infrastructure, gaining valuable insights and data on the structures that is then parsed via Gecko's AI-powered operating platform, Cantilever. That information is then used by organizations to optimize, maintain and monitor the infrastructure.

The company works across a variety of physical assets and industries, ranging from L3Harris Technologies and the U.S. Navy for critical military aircraft and ships; energy companies like NAES, the U.S.'s largest independent power operator, to modernize and optimize power plants, and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, where Gecko's robots inspect gas facilities, tanks and other infrastructure.

"Gecko was built out of my college dorm room, to what it is today — the company ensuring the safety of public infrastructure, the optimization of energy and manufacturing facilities, and the modernization of militaries to deter global conflict," Loosararian said in a statement announcing the latest round.

The company said it will use the additional funding to accelerate its growth, and its continued push into sectors like defense, energy and manufacturing. Gecko said that its Cantilever operating platform provides insights that can do everything from modernizing C-130 aircraft to recommending how a power plant can operate at up to 5% greater efficiency.

"While much of the tech industry is focused on consumer AI applications, Gecko Robotics is using AI to address an important, underappreciated challenge – the building and maintenance of critical infrastructure," stated Trae Stephens, partner at Founders Fund, and also co-founder and executive chairman of defense tech company Anduril, the 2025 No. 1 Disruptor, in the deal statement. "Gecko's business continues to grow as organizations across a wide variety of sectors realize this work is more safely and thoroughly performed by sensors and robots than humans," he added.

If the U.S. continues to impose AI semiconductor restrictions on China, then chipmaker Huawei will take advantage of its position in the world's second-largest economy, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC Thursday.

"Our technology is a generation ahead of theirs," Huang told CNBC at the sidelines of the Viva Technology conference in Paris.

However, he warned that: "If the United States doesn't want to partake, participate in China, Huawei has got China covered, and Huawei has got everybody else covered."

In the face of U.S. export curbs that restrict Chinese firms from buying advanced semiconductors used in the development of AI, Beijing has focused on nurturing domestic firms such as Huawei in a bid to build its own AI chip ecosystem.

Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei this week told the People's Daily Newspaper of the governing Communist party that Huawei's single chip is still behind the U.S. by a generation.

"The United States has exaggerated Huawei's achievements. Huawei is not that great. We have to work hard to reach their evaluation," Ren said in comments reported by Reuters.

Huang said it was crucial that AI developers around the world build on the American technology stack — or layers of technology — not that of China's.

"If we want the American technology stack to win around the world, then giving up 50% of the world's AI researchers is not sensible … So long as all the AI developers are in China, you know, I think [the] China stack is going to win. And so we just have to be mindful of near-term actions on long-term, unintended consequences," he said.

Export curbs have proved something of a sore spot as trade tensions escalated between the U.S. and China. Last month, the White House said it would "aggressively revoke visas of Chinese students," including those studying in critical fields. China also accused the U.S. of undermining trade talks after the U.S. issued an industry warning against using Chinese chips that singled out Huawei.

Huang said it's his job to inform President Donald Trump's administration on the nature of Nvidia's tech and the dynamics of the industry. Trump, "knows what he's doing. He has a game plan. I trust him, and we'll support him the best we can," he said.

The Nvidia CEO has been making waves in Europe this week, starting in London on Monday when he heaped praise on the U.K.

He told an audience that the country has "one of the richest AI communities anywhere on the planet" as he pledged investment commitments from his firm into the country. 

On Thursday, Huang talked up Europe's potential, saying France in particular has the potential to "export AI" alongside its energy exports.

"I think all the pieces of the puzzle are here. You got to take advantage of it," he told CNBC, adding that Europe is a market all by itself, independent of China and "anything else."

Members of the European bloc are looking to improve their position when it comes to AI developments and are reassessing their reliance on foreign technology firms for critical technology and infrastructure.

"Intelligence is the foundational layer of every industry. And so it stands to reason that long-term intelligence will be the size of the GDP of each region, and therefore, in total, the EU is going to be a very large market for AI," Huang added.

UAE oil giant ADNOC has joined the fray of firms said to be circling some of BP's highly prized assets, as takeover speculation for the embattled energy major kicks into overdrive.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Company is thought to be weighing up a move for some of the London-listed firm's assets, should the oil major break up or seek to divest more units, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

ADNOC is reportedly most interested in BP's liquefied natural gas (LNG) assets, although it is also said to have considered a full takeover of the company. It is understood by Bloomberg that any prospective deal would likely take place via ADNOC's international unit, XRG.

Spokespeople at BP, ADNOC and XRG declined to comment on the speculation when contacted by CNBC.

A protracted period of underperformance relative to its industry peers has thrust BP into the spotlight as a prime takeover candidate. British rival Shell, as well as U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron, are among some of the names that have been touted as possible suitors.

Any potential deal between ADNOC and BP is seen as far from a foregone conclusion, but analysts point out that the two companies share a long-standing relationship across hydrocarbons and renewables over a range of geographies, most notably in Abu Dhabi and most recently in Egypt.

Former BP CEO Bernard Looney, who left the company after less than four years in the job in September 2023, sits on the XRG board alongside ADNOC CEO Sultan al-Jaber.

Maurizio Carulli, global energy and materials analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said ADNOC's purported interest in some of BP's assets is a "significant" development — albeit one that is somewhat expected, given ADNOC is a growing, cash-rich business looking to expand further into gas.

"That said, it seems unlikely that Adnoc would consider a full bid for BP as a whole given the company would not be strategically interested in BP's oil assets. A few other listed oil majors might, though," Carulli told CNBC by email.

"BP's discrete assets, both upstream and downstream, will no doubt capture large interest from a number of both energy and private equity players," he added.

Last month, BP reportedly attracted interest from a number of possible buyers for its Castrol lubricants business, a unit thought to be one of the "crown jewels" of its portfolio.

Energy companies including India's Reliance Industries and Saudi Arabia's oil behemoth Aramco, as well as private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Lone Star Funds, were all previously touted as suitors for BP's Castrol unit, Bloomberg reported on May 28, citing people familiar with the matter.

Apollo Global Management and Lone Star declined to comment on the report. CNBC has also contacted Reliance Industries and Aramco.

BP is seeking to fend off a prospective takeover by restoring investor confidence. The company launched a fundamental strategic reset earlier in the year and, despite posting weaker-than-expected first-quarter profit, CEO Murray Auchincloss told CNBC in late April that the firm was "off to a great start" in delivering on its new direction.

Shares of BP have stabilized in recent weeks, following a sharp fall in early April, as trade war volatility rocked financial markets. The stock price is down more than 4% in the year to date.

Allen Good, director of equity research at Morningstar, said it is unlikely BP will be prepared to split with significant pieces of its upstream portfolio, given the firm's recent green strategy U-turn to double down on hydrocarbons.

As part of BP's strategic reset, the company announced plans to increase annual oil and gas spending to investment to $10 billion through 2027, while slashing spending on renewables. It is also targeting $20 billion in divestments over the coming years.

"Activist pressure has been more on further cost and capital reductions, not necessarily core divestitures. Breaking up the company is unlikely to be the solution shareholders are looking for," Allen told CNBC by email.

For XRG, which ADNOC launched last year, reports of interest in some of BP's assets come as the investment company seeks deals on gas and chemicals assets to help it reach an enterprise value of $80 billion.

"We are committed to delivering long-term value for our stakeholders and reinforcing Abu Dhabi and the UAE's role as a global energy and chemicals leader," ADNOC's al-Jaber said at the time.

Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said any potential transactions between ADNOC and BP were likely to be hard-driven, with each party striving to defend its own interests.

"BP is under pressure to deliver on its goal to reduce debt, through improved organic cash flow and asset disposals," Mould told CNBC.

"ADNOC will be well aware of this, and how the clock may be ticking so far as BP management is concerned, and it will therefore look to drive a hard bargain in the process, should it indeed be interested in some of BP's assets, as reports suggest," he added.

Coinbase teams up with American Express to offer its first credit card, giving up to 4% back in Bitcoin—exclusively for Coinbase One subscribers. 

Coinbase is launching its first-ever branded credit card in partnership with American Express, set to roll out this fall. Called the Coinbase One Card, it will be available only to U.S. members of Coinbase One, the platform's monthly subscription service. The card will offer 2% to 4% back in Bitcoin on everyday purchases, along with access to American Express perks.

This is a first-of-its-kind product for Coinbase, which previously only offered a prepaid debit card with Visa in 2020. 

“We see real potential in the combination of Coinbase and crypto with the powerful backing of American Express, and what the card offers is an excellent mix of what customers are looking for right now,” said Will Stredwick, head of American Express global network services, during the Coinbase State of Crypto Summit in New York.

The card is part of a larger push by Coinbase to expand its subscription-based services. Coinbase One costs $29.99/month and includes zero trading fees, higher staking rewards, and customer support perks. The company also announced a cheaper version—Coinbase Basic—for $4.99/month or $49.99/year, which includes fewer features.

Coinbase's subscription business is growing fast. It brought in $698.1 million in Q1 2025, compared to $1.26 billion in trading revenue. According to William Blair analyst Andrew Jeffrey, this kind of recurring revenue is a big reason why long-term investors are sticking with the stock.

Launched in 2023, Coinbase One now has over a million members. The company has been steadily growing its ecosystem with products like its Base developer platform and a self-custody wallet. 

The company has long positioned Bitcoin at the center of its strategy—offering BTC custody services to institutions, supporting Bitcoin ETFs, integrating Bitcoin rewards into its products, and actively advocating for Bitcoin-friendly regulation in Washington. Coinbase also supports Bitcoin development directly through funding grants and engineering support. As the largest publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S., Coinbase continues to frame Bitcoin not just as an asset, but as the foundation of its long-term vision.

The concept already has four research tracks already under review, which are connected to existing efforts in the Ethereum ecosystem.

Ethereum builders outlined a “Lean Ethereum” roadmap that aims to trim layer-1 complexity while hardening security, according to researcher Thomas Coratger on June 12 via X. 

Co-founder Vitalik Buterin and researcher Justin Drake discussed the concept in a breakout session at the Forschungsingenieurtagung conference in Berlin. It proposes three guiding targets: security, simplicity, and optimality.

Coratger wrote that the roadmap calls for post-quantum-ready signatures and reworked data availability to guard the ledger against future cryptographic threats. 

He added that simplicity would come from slimming consensus, execution, and data layers so new contributors can audit code without steep learning curves. Optimality aims to achieve lower latency and overhead, keeping Ethereum competitive while maintaining its decentralization.

Buterin illustrated the effort with four research tracks already under review. The first is a three-step-finality (3SF) protocol that delivers rapid block finality in a compact codebase, while the second is aggregated post-quantum signatures.

A third research track focuses on zero-knowledge virtual machines that enable verifiable execution, with a data-layer refactor that merges blobs through erasure coding, rounding up the tracks. 

Drake connected those tracks to existing strategy items, including user-experience upgrades, scalability work, and full-chain sampling.

Furthermore, Drake laid out several near-term proposals under the “lean” banner, including lean staking, which would strip validator duties to the essentials.

Lean verifiability would let low-power devices confirm blocks with modest bandwidth. A lean crypto approach would reduce the protocol's reliance on multiple primitives, favoring a single hash function and post-quantum schemes wherever possible. 

He also promoted “lean specs,” breaking logic into small modules, and “lean formal verification,” starting with zk-VMs and signature aggregation.

Coratger noted the alignment between these ideas and active engineering work, such as Fork-Choice enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL), zkEVM pilots, and beam roadmap prototypes. 

He reported that session participants acknowledged the difficulty of achieving optimality but viewed the payoff as worthwhile, especially as rollups and centralized sequencers reshape Layer 2 processing. 

Ethereum Foundation co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak described Drake's presentation as a forward-looking synthesis of current projects and longer-range research.

Stanczak wrote that many ideas will proceed to testing while others will evolve, calling the roadmap an “unifying theory” rather than an immediate directive. He added that the talk motivated contributors by tying today's milestones to a broader technical horizon.

Yet, Lean Ethereum remains a research framework without a scheduled hard fork proposal. Core teams plan to refine design documents, prototype features such as mini-3SF, and evaluate trade-offs in working group calls.

Ethereum token platform Zora has sued Deloitte to stop it from using the “Zora AI” name for its digital workforce AI platform, claiming trademark infringement.

The company also filed a restraining order, which has yet to be granted, that would bar Deloitte from using “Zora,” “Zora AI,” or the Zora.ai domain until the conclusion of the lawsuit.

The token launchpad is seeking actual and punitive damages, and for Deloitte to cover its attorney fees. It also wants Deloitte to transfer the Zora.ai domain.

Zora gained steam during the NFT bull run of 2021-22, raising $50 million in funding in 2022 that valued the firm at $600 million.

More recently, it has functioned as a social media platform that automatically turns every post into a token on Coinbase's Ethereum layer-2 network, Base. It sparked a flurry of hype after the creator of Base, Coinbase's Jesse Pollak, went on a “content coin” campaign.

When it launched in April, the ZORA token briefly climbed as high as $0.03438 on its opening day, but has since slumped to $0.009324—down 73% from peak. The token has seen $21.7 million worth of trading volume in the past day and currently has a market cap of $29 million.

A letter sent to Deloitte claims its new AI product “wrongly capitalizes on Zora's goodwill and reputation,” and “creates a false association between Deloitte and Zora and the ZORA Marks.”  Deloitte's infringements of Zora's rights must immediately stop, it demands.

Deloitte first started marketing its new AI platform in March, promoting it as a suite of “ready-to-deploy” agents that can augment clients' workforces. In its press release, the company said Hewlett Packard is already using the tech to analyze its financial statements.

The token launchpad caught wind of the company's plans and sent a letter asking it to reconsider the name of the product a month before Deloitte started promoting it.

“As you must be aware, Zora is one of the most prominent marketplace platforms in which users can mint, buy, offer for sale, sell, and curate NFTs. Zora provides an innovative AI-driven method, including for consumers to use in creating NFTs and undertaking NFT-related transactions,” the company's lawyers wrote in a Feb. 14 letter to Deloitte.

The company included a copy of its trademarks, the earliest of which was filed in May 2020. The most recent trademark was granted in March 2025. The trademarks protect the company's use of “Zora” in relation to downloadable mobile apps or software, cryptocurrency exchange services, and non-downloadable web applications.

Stephen Barrese, a trademark attorney at Dilworth & Barrese, told Decrypt that if Deloitte's attorneys did a search, they would have seen pending applications for two of Zora's most recent trademarks.

"Both were filed as 'intent to use,' which means that they get a 'constructive use date' at the time of filing," he said, hypothesizing that someone at Deloitte might have missed that detail.

"This explains why Deloitte's argument is that there's no way that people would confuse the NFT platform with their digital workforce platform," Barrese added. "They cannot say that they were unaware of the prior filed applications."

Sure enough, that's exactly how Deloitte responded to Zora's letter a few weeks later.

“We do not believe that you or your client should have any cause for concern,” Deloitte wrote in response. “Our use of ‘Zora AI' is for different goods and services than those offered by your client, as well as intended for a different audience than your client, such that there would not be any likelihood of consumer confusion.”

A response from Zora in March goes even further, pointing out that Zora has been a client of Deloitte since 2022, and blasts the firm's “blatant disregard of its clients' basic intellectual rights.”

The complaint includes an email that notes the token launchpad was being advised by Rob Massey, who's a tax leader in Deloitte's blockchain and digital assets practice.

“Rob asked that Zora give him the opportunity to discuss internally and thus hold off on escalating this matter to a court,” Zora attorney Merri Moken wrote in an email last week ahead of the June 9 deadline she'd given Deloitte to respond.

The lawsuit was filed on June 11 in the Southern District of New York and has been assigned to Judge Arun Subramanian.

"Zora takes great care in developing and protecting its intellectual property, including the ZORA trademark, which was established well before Deloitte Consulting's use of the same mark," Zora attorney Merri Moken told Decrypt. "Zora is a client of Deloitte Tax, and was disappointed to see Deloitte Consulting adopt Zora's mark without permission. After making multiple attempts to resolve this matter amicably, Zora was ultimately left with no choice but to seek a restraining order to prevent further infringement and harm. We are confident the Court will restrain Deloitte and find Deloitte liable."

Deloitte did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

Ethereum reclaimed a significant technical level in the latest 24-hour trading session, with its price crossing above the $2,800 mark and briefly touching $2,870. This interesting cross makes it the first time since February 2025 that Ethereum has traded above the $2,800 threshold. The move comes amid rising bullish momentum flowing out from Bitcoin, and according to recent analysis from a crypto expert, this could be just the beginning of a much larger rally for Ethereum.

Technical Pattern Says Ethereum Could Be Close To $20,000

An interesting technical formation on Ethereum has now caught the attention of some traders: a classic inverse Head and Shoulders bottom. According to crypto expert Gert van Lagen, who shared his analysis on the social media platform X, this inverse head and shoulders is setting up on a long-term timeframe. 

Specifically, Ethereum's two-week candlestick chart, shared by the analyst, reveals a fully formed structure with a left shoulder in mid-2021, a pronounced head that took shape during the bear market in late 2022 to early 2023, and a right shoulder forming throughout the 2024 correction into early 2025. 

The left shoulder emerged in mid-2021, when Ethereum's price peaked around $4,870, then retraced into the year-end. The head was formed at the lows around $1,350 in 2022 and 2023. The right shoulder is currently in formation after the Ethereum price rebounded from roughly $1,600 in 2025. Finally, this pattern is also highlighted by a symmetry around the neckline drawn near the $4,200 price region. 

Keeping this in mind, the neckline of the pattern, which is anchored just below the $4,200 resistance level, is now the most important level to break above. A confirmed breakout above this zone could activate the full bullish target projected by the technical formation.

ETH Price Close To $20,000

According to Gert van Lagen, the two-week head-and-shoulders pattern suggests Ethereum may be “closer to $20K than most anticipate.” His price target calculation follows a classic technical methodology. By measuring the vertical distance from the head's lowest point to the neckline resistance and then projecting that same distance upward from the neckline, he arrives at a target of approximately $19,500, which is more than a 600% gain from today's price levels. 

In the same analysis, van Lagen also highlighted a descending broadening wedge pattern that has been forming since mid-2023. This secondary structure reinforces the notion that Ethereum may embark on a significantly larger breakout once $4,200 is cleared.

However, this projection of $19,500 is based on the technical symmetry of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, rather than fundamental shifts in Ethereum. Additionally, there is no clear timeline for this target; however, based on the multi-year nature of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, the price target may also take up to four years to materialize.

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,772, having retraced slightly from $2,870.

A more upbeat macroeconomic backdrop, growing corporate appetite for digital assets, and increased regulatory clarity will fuel a constructive outlook for crypto markets in the second half of 2025, according to a report by Coinbase Research.

After a bumpy first quarter marked by a brief contraction in U.S. GDP and trade disruptions, data now point to stronger growth. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker has jumped to 3.8% QoQ as of early June, a sharp upgrade from earlier in the year. This shift, alongside expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and a less aggressive trade policy, has eased recession fears and strengthened investor sentiment.

Declining dollar dominance and inflation protection use-cases may also boost bitcoin's BTC$106,822.53 appeal, even if long-dated U.S. Treasury yields remain elevated, the report said. Altcoins may lag unless they benefit from specific catalysts, such as ETF approvals or protocol developments.

Meanwhile, public companies are increasingly adding crypto to their balance sheets, aided by a 2024 rule change allowing "mark-to-market" accounting for digital assets. While this trend is expanding demand, it's also introducing new systemic risks. Firms that fund crypto buys with convertible debt may be forced to sell if refinancing options dry up or prices fall sharply.

Regulatory developments are also expected to reshape the market, the report said. 

The Senate recently passed the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan stablecoin bill now heading to the House. A broader market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, aims to define the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing digital assets. If passed, it could clarify rules for both issuers and investors.

Separately, the SEC is considering more than 80 crypto ETF applications, including multi-asset funds and proposals involving staking and altcoins. Some rulings could be made as early as July, and the rest are likely to be finalized by October.

Overall, bitcoin appears poised to benefit from both macro and structural tailwinds in the second half of the year, while the outlook for altcoins will depend on navigating a more complex and still-evolving regulatory and liquidity environment, according to the report.

Hong Kong's initiative against illicit crypto activities sets the stage for potential regional adoption of similar systems.

Hong Kong is stepping up its fight against crypto-related money laundering by working with the University of Hong Kong (HKU) on technology-driven solutions, including improved tracking of virtual asset flows.

The new effort was revealed in a government statement on June 12, following a four-day workshop focused on enhancing anti-money laundering (AML) strategies.

Under the project, engineers and researchers from HKU will collaborate with Hong Kong Customs to design tools capable of mapping and monitoring the movement of digital assets across blockchain networks.

The tool aims to help law enforcement identify suspicious patterns tied to money laundering and other illicit financial activities.

Assistant Commissioner Wong Ho-yin of Hong Kong Customs stressed that crypto-related crimes are rising. He noted that because these crimes often span multiple jurisdictions, no single agency can address the issue alone.

Considering this, Ho-yin highlighted the need to expand partnerships across the financial, academic, and law enforcement sectors to address these cross-border money laundering risks.

Professor David Srolovitz, HKU's Dean of Engineering, echoed this and highlighted the importance of combining technical innovation with regulatory enforcement. He said that by bringing together experts from different fields, Hong Kong can better address the complex challenges of financial crime in the digital era.

Hong Kong's push to strengthen crypto oversight comes amid broader global concerns. The borderless nature of digital assets makes them an attractive tool for criminals seeking to move funds discreetly.

According to a recent report by TRM Labs, some Chinese underground banks, operating through informal channels known as fei qian, have become key facilitators of crypto-based money laundering.

These groups have established close links with global organised crime syndicates, including Mexican drug cartels. Their services allow wealthy Chinese individuals to bypass domestic capital controls and enable foreign criminals to move or repatriate illicit funds.

While jurisdictions such as the United States already use advanced tools to monitor crypto-related crime, Hong Kong's upcoming system could encourage other countries in the region to adopt similar approaches.

As regulators catch up to crypto, Berkon says trust and transparency are becoming competitive advantages.

Irina Berkon, CFO of Metallicus, took the stage at Consensus 2025 in Toronto last month to deliver a message many financial executives have grown wary of: crypto and blockchain still matter.

While AI dominates headlines and CFO inboxes alike, Berkon argued real progress is finally happening in crypto infrastructure and finance leaders should take note. Speaking from experience inside a company that builds blockchain solutions and uses them in day-to-day treasury management, she made a case for why this long-hyped technology is beginning to earn its place in the finance function.

In a recent interview, Berkon explains how Metallicus uses blockchain for multi-layered control, how she approaches forecasting in a market still taking shape and why the post-hype era of crypto could offer more substance and security than ever before. She also shares her unique but telling journey into the industry and her thoughts on the future of accounting talent.

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

IRINA BERKON: As a crypto company, we not only offer this type of service, but we use it ourselves. Just a few minutes before this call, we had a real example of how we use blockchain technology for treasury management and fund control.

We manage various crypto wallets that hold our assets. One of them uses a blockchain wallet with a multi-signature feature. I had just asked someone to initiate a transaction requiring an M SIG to move funds from one wallet to another. That request was then routed to the designated signatories. Until it is fully approved, the funds remain locked — neither the initiator nor any single signer can move them alone. The transfer only happens once the required group signs off, as per our defined rules.

For me, the biggest benefit is the assurance that no single person can move assets independently. This not only enhances security but also prevents reconciliation issues. Ultimately, it's all about strong treasury and cash management.

This will sound familiar to anyone who's dealt with layered approvals in traditional banking. When managing crypto in your treasury, the same level of oversight is essential. You need full visibility into where assets are going and who's authorized each transaction — whether it's the CFO or another member of the finance team.

We talk and listen closely to our customers, who are primarily financial institutions — credit unions, community banks and similar organizations. From a revenue standpoint, our business model is very much like that of a typical B2B software company. I focus on what we're selling, how we're pricing it and how that translates into revenue. The main difference is that the technology we're offering happens to be blockchain-based and crypto-adjacent.

"The biggest benefit is the assurance that no single person can move assets independently. This not only enhances security but also prevents reconciliation issues."

Irina Berkon

CFO, Metallicus 

When it comes to the volatility of crypto, whether prices go up or down, we view it the same way any company would treat volatile assets on their balance sheet. We happen to hold more crypto than cash, largely because we are a crypto company. We believe in the technology, we understand it deeply and we're well-positioned to manage that exposure, perhaps more so than companies that don't actively manage crypto in their treasury.

We monitor the market very closely. Still, our forecasting and financial planning remain driven primarily by our customers. All investment decisions regarding cryptocurrency allocations are made jointly by our CEO Marshall Hayner and me, with guidance from our board.

I don't think it was legitimate in the past. There was a lot of talk, a lot of hype, but not much real belief or action. We've been at this for a long time, having conversations with banks and regulators, trying to lay the groundwork. And only now are we seeing credit unions and small community banks come forward and say, “We're ready. We want to implement this.”

The opposite of what most people assume is true. Interest is growing now, and the response we're getting is stronger than ever. Back then, no one was integrating crypto or blockchain into their financial institutions in a meaningful way. There was speculation, and a handful of companies tried to do it, but they didn't stick. There just wasn't a strong use case or a clear path forward.

Today, it's different. There are a few reasons for that. The regulatory landscape has started to mature, and the tone from the top, especially from regulators and policymakers, feels more supportive. That's giving financial institutions more confidence to explore this space seriously.

And frankly, there's also been a shakeout. A lot of the companies that weren't serious or couldn't actually deliver are gone. What's left are the real builders — the companies that have stuck with it, developed the technology and are ready to support implementation. So now, not only do banks and credit unions feel safer from a compliance standpoint, but they also have solid, credible partners they can work with.

My story is very San Francisco. I was walking down the Embarcadero when a group of young entrepreneurs rode by on electric scooters. One of them stopped and said, ‘Hey, I think I've met you before.' I said, ‘Yeah, maybe.' Then he asked, ‘Aren't you in finance?' I said, ‘Yes.' And then, right there on the sidewalk, he said, ‘Do you want to be CFO of our company? We're doing an initial coin offering.'

I said, ‘Cool, what's an ICO?'

He explained it. We'd [previously] met briefly at a friend's house, and he remembered I had a finance background. He and his co-founder already had a license and a plan to write a white paper, attend conferences and launch their product. This was around August 2018.

I had to take off my auditor and public accounting hat and step into more of a business development and marketing role. They didn't need a traditional CFO; they needed someone who could help build from the ground up. So I joined the team, traveled the world and pitched the product at conferences from Singapore to London.

"There's a real compliance layer now. It's not just about cool tech or internet culture anymore."

Irina Berkon

CFO, Metallicus

In 2019, I spoke at Consensus in New York. After my talk, an auditor from BPM approached me and said they had a client in San Francisco — Metallicus — that needed a CFO to complete its audit. I met with [Marshall Hayner], and I asked, ‘Why do you need an audit?' He said, ‘Because I want to get money transmitter licenses in all 50 states. I want to be a legit crypto company.'

He started walking me through the compliance framework he was building, and I thought, ‘This is perfect.' After seeing so much chaos in the space, I wanted to work with someone serious about doing things the right way. That was January 2020, and I've been with Metallicus ever since.

What's kept me here — and in this industry — is that it's finally moved beyond the hype. There's a real compliance layer now. It's not just about cool tech or internet culture anymore. There are real products being built, and major financial institutions are starting to implement them. This is infrastructure. 

That said, we still have fun. Marshall is on the board of the Dogecoin Foundation, so we're close to the meme world. But we're also doing serious work, and the space now demands serious skill sets. These are people with backgrounds in public accounting, regulation and financial operations.

I talk to my audit team about this all the time, especially the younger folks. I think there's this expectation now that big opportunities will just fall into your lap. And in crypto, I've seen it firsthand, so many people with CFO titles who didn't actually know finance. They got the title, but then what?

Firms absolutely should pay people well so they don't burn out or leave public accounting too early. But we also need to be clear: you're not going to land a serious CFO role — or any high-level finance job — without putting in the work.

"More people are going to want to work in blockchain and AI, which is only going to deepen the talent shortage in traditional industries."

Irina Berkon

CFO, Metallicus 

That means learning the fundamentals, building relationships and showing up consistently. Sometimes it's a grind. Sometimes the hours are long. But that experience matters. That foundation is what prepares you for the next step. If you skip it, you're just not going to be ready when the opportunity comes.

Public accounting gave me the discipline, the ability to work under pressure and the confidence to take on something new. When I was at Grant Thornton, we used to host industry conferences for restaurant clients. I remember being a fourth-year associate, sitting in a room with the CEO of Whole Foods and thinking, ‘How cool is this?' That kind of access sticks with you.

Firms need to do more of that, give people a sense of where this career can take them. Yes, you have to put in your hours. But look at the payoff. No serious company is going to hire a CFO with no experience. More people are going to want to work in blockchain and AI, which is only going to deepen the talent shortage in traditional industries. So if firms want to retain their best people, they need to inspire them early.

              Highlights            



                        Bitcoin has evolved from a niche asset to a mainstream institutional-grade investment, with Fortune 500 companies, like Strategy and GameStop among others, allocating billions to bitcoin holdings, transforming corporate treasuries into crypto-forward financial operations.                      


                        Companies are leveraging complex financial instruments (e.g., convertible notes, structured products, bitcoin-backed loans) to gain crypto exposure, potentially blurring the line between financial innovation and speculative risk.                      


                        The role of corporate treasurers is expanding beyond traditional finance to include crypto expertise, risk governance, and digital asset strategy, prompting a critical reevaluation of bitcoin's place on balance sheets — as a hedge, speculative asset, or branding signal — based on a company's unique financial profile.                      

In the early days of bitcoin, it was hard to imagine Fortune 500 treasury teams doing anything more than monitoring its unpredictable price swings out of casual interest.

But 15 years and several bull-bear cycles later, the cryptocurrency is no longer just the domain of technologists and retail investors. It's evolving into an institutional-grade asset. Not just in theory, but in practice.

Fortune 500 blockchain adoption has allegedly now hit 60% with institutions injecting as much as $50 billion into crypto funds in Q1. Leading the pack is the one-time software company Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has compiled a war chest of 580,000 bitcoin, worth about $63 billion, since the middle of 2020, with its latest purchase coming within the past two weeks.

Strategy has transformed itself into a bitcoin treasury company and is now primarily in the business of selling securities to raise money to buy the cryptocurrency. Far from being viewed as a black sheep, the company's “bitcoin treasury” approach has spurred a wave of publicly traded copycats.

GameStop, for example, on Wednesday (June 11) announced it was issuing $1.75 billion in convertible notes to buy bitcoin. This followed an earlier Q1 acquisition of 4,710 BTC (about $513 million), which made GameStop the 13th‑largest corporate holder.

Elsewhere, The Blockchain Group, which describes itself as Europe's first bitcoin treasury company, on Monday (June 9) announced a $300 million issuance for, you guessed it, the purposes of purchasing more bitcoin.

From structured notes and hedging instruments to yield-bearing custodial accounts and even Bitcoin-backed loans, the ecosystem is diversifying at a pace few anticipated. But beneath the innovation lies a familiar tension: are these truly risk-managed tools for corporate finance, or cleverly packaged speculative bets in disguise?

Milestones like the launch of CME Bitcoin futures (2017), the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. (2024), and the entrance of traditional financial institutions like Fidelity, BlackRock, and JPMorgan into the crypto arena have provided a sense of legitimacy.

With regulatory clarity slowly improving, especially around custody and reporting standards, corporate finance professionals are being offered a potential new value proposition: the cryptocurrency not as a gamble, but as a balance sheet diversification strategy.

As PYMNTS covered, even the Ivy-league institution Brown University has recently disclosed a $4.9 million investment in BlackRock's bitcoin ETF, signaling a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in diversified portfolios.

After all, the CLARITY Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets and crypto markets in the U.S., is set to be considered by the full U.S. House of Representatives after being advanced by two House committees Tuesday (June 10). At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants to ease restrictions governing decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

The treasurer's role in this environment? It's no longer merely about cash, FX, or interest rate swaps — but increasingly about whether the CFO team has the infrastructure, expertise, risk governance, and capital strategies to harness any crypto strategy judiciously.

Bitcoin is maturing into a multi-dimensional treasury instrument: a defensive store-of-value, a potential yield generator and a signal of corporate innovation. But behind the headlines and bold plays lies a complex ecosystem rich with financing engineering, volatility exposure, regulatory uncertainty, and governance pitfalls.

After all, for all the innovation, there's a critical issue at the heart of this trend: are these financial tools being used to serve prudent corporate strategy, or are they a new flavor of speculative risk?

Some critics argue that bitcoin-linked treasury products may be less about strategic diversification and more about corporate speculation dressed in financial engineering. Today's suite of corporate crypto offerings are designed to mitigate some of the risks. But in doing so, they can sometimes introduce new forms of complexity — particularly around counterparty risk, liquidity constraints and regulatory uncertainty.

The accounting treatment of crypto assets remains a thorny issue. In the U.S., bitcoin is still classified as an intangible asset, meaning unrealized losses must be recognized, but gains can't be booked unless the asset is sold. This creates a lopsided risk profile for public companies.

Perhaps the central question for corporate treasurers is this: What is bitcoin in the context of the corporate balance sheet?

Is it a modern hedge against fiat inflation, akin to gold? A speculative instrument that can juice short-term returns but introduces material downside? Or a strategic signaling tool — part financial asset, part branding exercise?

The answer may depend on the type of business and its risk profile. For a tech-forward firm with high margins and a long investment horizon, limited bitcoin exposure may offer a form of asymmetric upside. For a capital-intensive industrial company with tight liquidity, it may be an unjustifiable risk.

MANHATTAN — U.S. President Donald Trump again touted his crypto bona fides at a conference Thursday, telling an audience it was an "honor" to be considered a crypto president.

Speaking in a 90-second recorded video at Coinbase's (COIN) State of Crypto Summit (no relation to the CoinDesk newsletter with the same name), Trump reiterated comments he's made at other events about ending his predecessor's so-called war on crypto and forming a working group to examine digital assets.

Trump also referenced legislation working its way through Congress.

"My administration is working with governors to pass the GENIUS Act supporting the creation of dollar-backed stablecoins, and we also will be working to create clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and bitcoin," he told a filled room to scattered applause.

The Senate's GENIUS Act will go through a procedural vote on Thursday, following a successful effort on Wednesday. Meanwhile, two key House committees advanced a market structure bill on Tuesday.

Trump also noted his executive order on establishing a national bitcoin BTC$107,398.10 reserve, saying, "we created the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the United States Digital Asset stockpile," though neither has actually been created yet.

Coinbase donated a million dollars to Trump's inaugural fund, and was a major backer of the Fairshake super PAC in the 2024 election. It's already committed tens of millions of dollars to Fairshake for the 2026 election.

Following his remarks, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Circle (CRCL) CEO Jeremy Allaire reflected on crypto and their respective company's evolutions, arguing that crypto could become a bigger part of the global financial system.

Allaire, whose company went public on the New York Stock Exchange last week, said it was difficult for Circle to meet with backers or other entities a decade ago.

"It was amazing to me that, like, I'd literally walk in a room with an insurance company, [and] they were literally, like, we were not sure we're allowed to have this meeting," Allaire said.

 AI is reshaping gaming, but blockchain is the missing link for next-gen, AI-powered social gaming experiences. Centralized systems limit progress, ownership and creativity. 

Opinion by: Kin Wai Lau, CEO of ZKcandy

Many people still don't see the point of using blockchain in games. It's a powerful tool that drives ownership and trading but is not vital for most gameplay types. 

The rise of AI shifts the equation. Blockchain isn't just a bonus feature for games enhanced with artificial intelligence — it's critical for building consistent gameplay. Fast processors and cloud servers are not enough anymore. AI agents and players need blockchain to enable a truly social gaming experience, where achievements can be recorded and carried across different titles, turning games into connected social ecosystems. Without decentralized infrastructure, agentic gameplay risks becoming a centralized walled garden where progress is temporary, creations are locked in, and experience is limited. 

Today's AI can build a personalized game flow as it learns and adapts in real time. But when AI runs within a centralized entity, its creations remain disposable, owned and monetized by corporations. 

Player interactions are stored privately on corporate servers. Memories and evolving character relationships die if the server shuts down. Game progress, AI agent evolution and generated content are tied to the lifecycle of a game session, account or corporate policy. If a player restarts the game or a publisher pulls the plug, all creations and achievements risk going in vain. When AI agents forget what they did yesterday, emerging storylines can't unfold consistently, and NPCs don't get smarter.

If the user owned at least part of the generated content, this could solve the problem, but the centralized nature of games doesn't permit this either. 

Here's another important thing: When AI adapts to the player, they become co-creators of the game. They build new characters, stories and items, but gamers can't benefit from their own creations. Creativity gets exploited when players can't capitalize on their contributions.

Blockchain is a natural fit to extend AI's memory and grant users ownership of their creations.

A distributed ledger can record game contents onchain, including player actions and achievements. Most AI agents today operate within a single session: They don't remember past interactions once the session ends. If the game progress records are on the blockchain, nothing gets lost. Agents can learn and evolve from session to session. This opens the way to consistent narratives and character arcs. 

When AI's progress is recorded onchain, it is stored in users' wallets, so players own and control their history — it's not lost or locked away. Besides the memory benefits for agentic AI, ownership opens broad opportunities for managing in-game assets.

The problem with traditional games is that gamers rent, not own, things — everything remains under the game publisher's control. If a player spends years shaping an AI companion or a unique item, that asset dies inside that game. It cannot be transferred to other games or platforms. It's trapped.

When AI is backed by blockchain, any generated item can be minted as an NFT and stay in the player's wallet forever. No one will ever delete it or restrict user access to it: NFTs are stored in a decentralized manner. And this is for their safekeeping and utility, not speculation. 

Users can transfer their assets beyond a single title across virtual worlds. When blockchain preserves memory and traits, items and even NPCs carry a consistent identity wherever they go. 

Games become a unified social ecosystem. Players can compare what they've built, show off their achievements with AI, and appreciate others' journeys. Social dynamics evolve around provable creativity, history and shared experiences, not simply leaderboards or loot boxes. That keeps players coming back — not just playing, but connecting.

Is it cost-efficient to store so much data onchain, though? Layer-2 and Layer-3 platforms have dramatically advanced over the past few years. They've become fast and cheap enough to handle thousands of transactions per second at a nearly invisible cost. Robust infrastructure has made it possible to store large amounts of data. Today's blockchains can easily handle AI data accumulation for as many users as needed.

Finally, asset ownership opens monetization opportunities. When crafted carefully, they enhance the gameplay, not replace it, like in early play-to-earn products. 

AI agents will forge unique items and mint them as NFTs, giving rise to in-game marketplaces woven directly into gameplay. Agents will seek the best trades and autonomously execute them. Players will enjoy playing, skipping most of the technical friction. They will invest their time, creativity and skill in how they shape assets, characters or storylines together with AI. And when they can license, rent or sell them on open marketplaces, they gain a real sense of agency and reward, turning their contributions into lasting value.

While players monetize what they create, game developers profit, too. They can earn a share of every marketplace transaction, charge fees for minting or customization, and offer premium AI tools to creators. This approach goes beyond one-and-done sales: Devs earn as players create, trade and grow.

Embracing public ledgers is a broad trend: Large enterprises and banks increasingly rely on decentralized infrastructure. Blockchain has played a role in gaming for years, but it isn't just a nice add-on anymore. It is critical to support agentic AI-driven entertainment through memory, ownership and monetization to make it a true social experience. Without Web3, next-gen games risk staying just a demo version of what they really can be.

Before Jack Butcher became a household name in the NFT ecosystem — before Checks, before Opepen, before his landmark 74 ETH ($123,500) sale in 2021 — he was just a designer chasing clarity. Not hype. Not headlines. Just clarity.

Butcher's journey didn't start in the meme coin trenches. It began in the agencies of London and New York where he cut his teeth as a commercial designer. 

“I bounced around the agency scene for about 10 years. I basically worked in every commercial application of design you can think of,” Butcher says. 

His agency grind eventually led him to build his own business, Visualize Value, known for its minimalist brand turned art studio that would go on to reshape how the internet thinks about ideas. Many of his visuals were even included in the The Almanack of Naval Ravikant book. 

Butcher's first interaction with crypto dates back to 2017 when he created blockchain explainer decks for clients at Visualize Value. But it wasn't until March 2021 that he minted his first NFT on Foundation, a moment he still recalls vividly. 

“I always refer to it as that 56k modem moment. Minting your first piece and seeing it arrive there underneath your name. It just felt like a moment in internet history.” 

Six months prior to minting Chisel, the UK born Butcher recalls being somewhat dismissive at the NFT space. His perspective shifted when an NFT collector, already a fan of Visualize Value, reached out wanting to own a digital version of his work. 

“I was sent a link to OpenSea six or so months before and was like, what is this? It did not capture my attention at all. There was nothing on there that was interesting to me. I just had no idea what I was looking at and clicked out of it quickly,” he says. 

But the collector persisted. “He messaged me and said, ‘I would love to collect your work.' I replied, ‘Sorry, man, I can't print white ink on black paper. I've tried, it's a nightmare.'”

Butcher credits the team at Foundation for also assisting in helping him change his mind about selling digital art with its beautifully presented UX at the time. 

His early works, particularly many of his 1-of-1 NFTs, showed him grappling with ideas around digital ownership. 

“A lot of my early pieces are trying to describe the mechanics that make it possible for people to own and trade digital property. As an artist, being able to make the artwork the product, rather than a marketing system for some other product or service was a game changer,” Butcher says. 

That change crystallized with NFTs, Explained, a 1-of-1 that sold for 74 ETH in March 2021. It encapsulated the design philosophy he'd been refining for years. “A lot of the genesis of the stuff I'm doing now is kind of in that piece,” Butcher says.

One of the most pivotal influences on Jack Butcher's creative evolution wasn't another designer, it was tech philosopher and investor Naval Ravikant. “That was a series of massive unlocks in my mind,” Butcher recalls of initially stumbling upon Naval's now iconic tweet thread How to Get Rich (without getting lucky). 

At the time, Butcher was running his own agency but feeling boxed in by the limitations of traditional client work. But Naval's mental models had a profound effect. They offered a lens for seeing the internet as leverage, where code, content, and capital worked around the clock. 

Inspired, Butcher began visualizing ideas from the thread in his signature minimalist style. 

“That was a huge inflection point in my story when I was trying to build these independent agency businesses. I had no real exposure or experience to the world of software and media. Just straight up agency experience. Naval's wisdom really helped with how I'd been thinking the world works versus how it actually works. I dove into that and visualized some of those ideas from the thread.” 

Things came full circle when Butcher's graphics were included in Eric Jorgenson's The Almanack of Naval Ravikant, a curated collection of Naval's wisdom that became a cult favorite in tech and crypto circles. 

“It massively changed my life. I'm still grateful that I stumbled upon those ideas and credit those frameworks for a lot of the massive inflection points in my personal journey and how I thought about putting work out into the world.” 

Butcher didn't just create two of the most iconic NFT projects of the last few years, he used them as onchain experiments in internet culture. 

Launched on January 3, 2023, Checks began as a 24 hour open edition mint priced at $8, a nod to Twitter's then new verification cost. Butcher's tweet at the time became a catch cry for the experiment, “This artwork may or may not be notable.”

The visual was simple: 80 multicolored checkmarks arranged in a grid. But beneath the surface, it was a statement on digital identity and decentralization. 

Checks introduced a burn mechanism where holders could merge pieces to create scarcer editions, with the ultimate rare edition being a singular black check. In 24 hours, Checks saw 16,031 mints occur with the project taking over the crypto twitter timeline for attention. 

Just five days later, Opepen launched as a free mint. 16,000 editions inspired by internet and popular crypto meme, ‘Pepe' and generative minimalism. Butcher introduced an opt-in model, where holders could actively participate in the reveal process of future “sets.” 

“There's thousands of hours and thousands of tweets that sort of contribute to the evolution of this thing. From the outside, all you see is the image. But the real artwork is the network effect, the conversation, the collective authorship,” says Butcher on Opepen. 

At the heart of Checks is the idea that cultural legitimacy is no longer handed down from institutions, it's earned, memed, and minted from the ground up. “The intention is for it to reference this sort of inversion of authority on the internet,” he says. 

Both projects act as decentralized commentaries on how the internet now works and how it could evolve. 

“People building consensus from the ground up, making a name for themselves, having a commercially viable art practice independently on the internet without needing a gallery or representation. I hope in a hundred years, that's a thousand times more true than it is today.”

To date, Opepen has surpassed 87,000 ETH ($240M at current prices) in trading volume and remains one of the most active onchain experiments in NFT history.

In the traditional art world, artists spend months or years in isolation, hoping their work resonates after the fact. But in the NFT space, Butcher values immediacy. 

“You really understand someone's appetite for your thing if you let them buy. The internet as a medium uniquely affords that ability at zero cost to reach every person that is subscribed to your work and beyond, over and over and over again. It completely changes the art practice,” Butcher says.  

It's not just about the sale, it's about the signal. With projects like Checks and Opepen, Butcher built in public, unveiling micro decisions as they happened. 

“All of these little updates, you're kind of reading and interpreting how things will be responded to. Even people explaining what you're doing back to you in a better way than you ever could,” he says. 

Butcher acknowledges the internet can be a brutal environment to compete in for attention and to receive feedback but has learned that transparency breeds resilience. 

“Open sourcing the process gives you so much more surface area to talk about what you're doing. What's the alternative? Disappear into a basement for 12 months, come out, and nobody pays attention?”

Butcher also highlighted another point he's been pondering with digital art. 

“I think the other thing that's generally underappreciated about digital art is people selling $1 worth, $10 worth, $100 worth. Most people who ever make art, ever put it out into the world, sell nothing. Zero.”

“I don't have the exact statistics on this but I would be very confident that the amount of people that have gotten paid for artwork or making these digital objects on the internet far surpasses anybody practicing art in the quote unquote atomic world.”

Royalties are always a controversial topic amongst the NFT world. Butcher has a contrarian take. 

“I have a controversial perspective on this. The idea of generating a royalty is like… you have to lose a customer to make money. You're getting paid on churn,” he says. 

For Butcher, the expectation of passive income through royalties can distort the creative process, encouraging artists to focus on trading volume instead of making new work. He describes the royalty boom of 2021 as a culture that rewarded frequency over originality. 

“A lot of people ended up in these golden handcuffs, where the focus switches to how do I get the artwork that's already out there to change hands without making new artwork.”

The result? The artists who needed royalties the most rarely saw them. 

“Expect to get paid for the work you make, price reasonably, and keep building. The people who don't need royalties get them. The people who need them don't. It's just a power law,” he says.

When did you mint your first NFT?

March 2021. 

When did you buy your first crypto? 

Bitcoin in 2017.

If you could only keep 3 NFTs forever, which ones would they be?

1. Piv: My favorite independent practicing crypto artist is a guy called Piv. He's Belgian. I own his Genesis 1 of 1 which is called Six Marilyns which is this Warholian composition of six female crypto punks and colored appropriately. 

2. I'd have to keep a single Check for sure. 

3. For the third, it'd be a toss up between a CryptoPunk or a Squiggle. 

Do you have a favorite collection or project when you put your collector hat on? 

I think I would probably go Squiggles by Snowfro. There's something about that collection that really demonstrates the beauty of the medium in a way that is not maybe not obvious at first, but as a designer, there's something like the fact that it has turned into this fine art collection that is massively inspiring. I think Erick is one of the best we have in terms of advocates for what we're doing here and has done a lot for the space in general. 

What's your favorite 1 of 1 art piece that you own?

My Piv piece – Six Marilyns 

If you had to name three favorite artists of yours, who would they be? 

1. diewiththemostlikes: He's great. Also an Opepen set contributor

2. Joe Peace: He's amazing 

3. Piv: Piv is in all of my answers so I would put him up there too

What's been your biggest NFT sale?

NFTs, explained. 74 ETH ($123,500 on date of sale). March 2021. 

Do you have a favorite Naval quote? 

“Be the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.”

What would be your advice to any other aspiring digital artists that want to dip their toe in the water with NFTs?

I think it's such a good time now that the euphoric bubble has blown over. It's totally changed my life on so many different trajectories. Even if it had not played out the way it did the last few years, it gives you a really good understanding of how the internet works. I think just even participating in this ecosystem. My hunch is that the internet will look way more like what we're doing now in the future than less.

Cointelegraph Magazine is a new publication that goes beyond the daily news and delves much more deeply into the stories, trends, and personalities that inspire cryptocurrency and blockchain conversations around the world.

We are people-centric, delving into *why* the true believers of blockchain feel they can change the world (and why they think it needs to be changed).

Through long-form features, thoughtful analysis, and a little humor and satire, we illustrate how the implementation of this technology is affecting the lives of countless people — today, right now, not at some distant point in the future.

Cross-border transactions are costing companies over $120 billion per year in transaction fees, a report by Oliver Wyman and J.P. Morgan found. In spite of great fintech advances, conventional payment systems are still inefficient.

Although originally designed as a platform to support decentralized cryptocurrencies, blockchain is emerging as a dynamic tool that can be used to greatly improve B2B cross-border payments. 

It can significantly reduce transaction costs and dependency on intermediary banks, as well as increase speed and security by promoting direct peer-to-peer transactions on a protected distributed ledger.

Within B2B cross-border payments, blockchain can act as a decentralized payment rail. With automated compliance checks through the use of smart contracts and custom transaction tracking, it can enable businesses to perform transfers directly across borders in minutes.

As blockchain-based payment systems become adopted by fintech companies, the industry is currently at a turning point. Will regulation complexities and slower integration stand in the way of blockchain truly reshaping the future of B2B payments?

Global B2B payments are still processed through an older, dated infrastructure despite improvements within fintech. Some significant problems hindering this include:

Most companies are researching B2B payment solutions to streamline costs and speed up transactions. International remittance complexities typically affect many intermediary banks, each charging its own processing fees. 

Foreign exchange (FX) markups by banks and financial institutions also add additional fees to transactions.

Key cost factors include:

Cross-border B2B payments are settled for an average of two to five business days, usually due to time zones, bank holidays, and manual authentication procedures. The SWIFT network, utilized by over 11,000 institutions, has several steps, each with failure points and delays.

This inefficiency creates cash flow issues and increases counterparty risks for international companies. The rising cost of cross-border transactions has generated a need for alternative payment methods, such as stablecoins and blockchain settlements.Lack of Transparency

Many standard B2B payments are based on unseen banking processes without real-time tracking. Consumer payments benefit from innovations like real-time payment networks, but cross-border business transactions still rely on traditional systems. Consequently, after initiating the payment, businesses hardly have any idea where the funds are at any point in time. The lack of transparency can lead to:

Compliance Barriers

The limitations of anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), as well as counter-terrorist financing (CTF) can be quite restricting for cross-border B2B transactions. Regulations differ in each jurisdiction, and companies must go through a complex web of compliance requirements.

Sanctions violations must be screened through transactions by financial institutions, which is time-consuming. The ever-changing nature of the regulations means that companies must continually update compliance systems, and this naturally adds to the expense of administrative costs and operating expenses.

Blockchain technology can combat these challenges within B2B payments by offering decentralized, transparent, and efficient payment systems. The biggest advantages of making use of blockchain-based B2B payments are:

Lowering Costs

Blockchain eliminates the presence of intermediaries like correspondent banks, minimizing the cost of transactions in conventional payment systems. In contrast to SWIFT-based transfers where both parties are served a portion of the transaction fee, blockchain transactions take place over a P2P (peer-to-peer) network that minimizes cost significantly.

Faster Settlement Times

Blockchain payment technologies decrease cross-border payment delays from multiple days to just minutes, which unlike the multi-step payment processes of traditional payment systems, revolutionizes fintech cross-border innovation. 

This is how cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like USDC (USD Coin) and USDT (Tether) facilitate faster payments between companies. Ethereum and Solana networks have been shown to be able to sustain high-speed, large-scale transactions without bank authorization, making them perfect for B2B settlements.

Transparency & Security

Blockchain employs a distributed ledger technology (DLT) to store all the transactions in an open, fixed ledger. This degree of transparency thus enables businesses to see transactions in real-time, minimizing the scope for fraud and inefficiency in reconciliations. Compared to traditional banking infrastructure, where transaction histories might have been hidden due to banking regulations, blockchain provides an unerasable history of transactions.

Smart Contracts

Blockchain payment solutions can also facilitate compliance automation via smart contracts, self-executing contracts with coded instructions to execute based on regulatory requirements. 

The contracts can automate AML and KYC checks prior to a transaction, enhancing the regulatory compliance of blockchain payments. Some blockchain networks have incorporated compliance-friendly frameworks to make regulatory adoption easier.

AI-Powered Fraud Detection

Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly used in blockchain payments to provide greater anti-fraud capability and regulatory reporting. AI-powered systems can analyze transaction behavior in real time, detect suspicious behavior, and stop fraudulent payments from being sent.

AI improves payment automation through cash management optimization, predicting delays, and automating transactional flows reconciliation. AI and blockchain together offer greater security levels and business operational efficiency improvement in B2B payments.

The Rise of Stablecoins in B2B Transactions

Stablecoins, digital currencies pledged against money, are emerging as a solution of choice for effortless B2B payments. The world's biggest banks and fintech giants, such as Bank of America, Standard Chartered, PayPal, Revolut, and Stripe, are moving into a space long dominated by Tether and Circle. 

With increasing regulatory support, stablecoins provide a quicker, cheaper alternative to traditional banking systems. Regulators now tackle concerns about stablecoin adoption, clearing the way for its inclusion in the global financial system.

Institutional Adoption

Financial institutions are realizing the potential of how blockchain technology can improve payment systems. The advances align with a trend of mainstream financial institutions embracing blockchain technology in business with the objective of improving efficiency, security, and transparency for B2B payments.

Notable institutional blockchain initiatives include:

CBDCs and the Future of Government-Issued Digital Currencies

World central banks are looking into the implementation of digital forms of their domestic currencies, or Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The digital currency will be a safe, low-cost, and efficient payment medium that can replace cash and upgrade the payment system. CBDCs could bypass intermediaries in payments to reduce expenses and enhance speed.

Blockchain must be able to seamlessly integrate with standard financial systems for it to be applied successfully in mass within B2B payments. Projects like mBridge are a central bank initiative that aims to enable instant, peer-to-peer cross-border payments in the form of CBDCs.

Meanwhile, solutions for seamless payments across different platforms are being designed by companies like Visa. For instance, cross-chain interoperability solutions which allows CBDCs to work with Real-Time Payments (RTP) systems. All these developments are leading us to wider blockchain adoption in traditional finance.

As B2B payments shift more toward blockchain, regulators are syncing the compliance frameworks. Whereas AML/KYC and CBDC regulations remain divided, efforts such as the Atlantic Council's digital asset policy roadmap are working towards creating international standards.

Policymakers are also seeking frameworks to bring CBDCs, stablecoins, and blockchain payments under a common legal framework. Regulatory sandboxes are empowering fintech companies to test blockchain solutions in pilot environments before implementing them on a full scale.

Santander, one of the biggest banking groups in Europe, is using RippleNet to enable cross-border payments via its One Pay FX service. The blockchain technology enables Santander to settle payments in seconds, whereas the usual 3–5 business days for SWIFT-based payments are required.

IBM's World Wire: A Cross-Border Payment Solution for Banks

IBM's World Wire uses the Stellar blockchain to enable cross-border payments between banks. The platform makes it possible for companies to pay in various digital assets, including stablecoins, offering a safe and regulatory-compliant payment method outside the traditional payment networks. 

World Wire has gone global, promoting financial inclusion and reducing global payment flows. Blockchain is revolutionizing B2B payments by offering reduced costs, quicker settlements, and improved transparency.

Senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal are demanding answers from Meta about potential plans to re-enter stablecoins — as a new bill heads for Senate vote that could give Meta political cover to launch a digital currency.

Two of the Senate's fiercest tech watchdogs are demanding answers from Mark Zuckerberg — again. But this time, it's not about privacy breaches or content moderation. It's about power. Specifically, the power to mint money.





As the Senate races toward a vote on the GENIUS Act, which would regulate payment stablecoins in the U.S., Senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal are pressing Meta (META) over concerns the company could exploit a political loophole to quietly re-enter the digital currency game.

In a direct letter to Zuckerberg, Warren and Blumenthal asked if Meta had consulted with lawmakers or lobbyists while the stablecoin bill was being drafted. They also want to know if Meta has plans to issue its own token — a move that would mark a resurrection of its long-abandoned Diem project.

They made the stakes clear: “It is more critical than ever that Congress and the public fully understand the extent of Meta's plans.”

The underlying fear? That the GENIUS Act, even before being signed into law, could be shaped in ways favorable to Big Tech. Especially if Trump's expected waivers give Meta a greenlight other stablecoin issuers won't get.

Meta has said “no Meta stablecoin” — that was the message from spokesperson Andy Stone in May. But that's not enough to silence lawmakers, especially given the company's track record.

“Facebook's Diem project didn't die on technical grounds,” one Hill insider noted. “It was smothered politically because nobody wanted Zuckerberg in control of a global payments rail.”

Warren and Blumenthal echoed that fear. They warned that if Meta controls a stablecoin again, the data it collects from billions of users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger could be weaponized into surveillance capitalism — turbocharged.

At the heart of the concern is a Trump-linked clause in the GENIUS Act. If passed, the bill would allow the President to grant certain waivers to stablecoin issuers — waivers that could exempt platforms like Meta from regulatory constraints.

Warren's office said: “This sets a dangerous precedent where political influence, not public interest, dictates who gets to issue digital money.”

This comes as Trump is reportedly backing World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform with ties to his inner circle. The potential for favoritism has sparked outrage among Democrats, who fear the stablecoin bill could become a Trojan horse for political favors.

Even if Meta doesn't launch its own stablecoin, its potential entrance into payments would upend the sector. Billions of users, integrated messaging apps, and massive financial reach make Meta a top contender to dominate retail stablecoin usage overnight — if allowed.

If Meta leans on existing tokens like USDC or USDT, that could accelerate stablecoin adoption but concentrate power in unsettling ways. If it issues its own coin under a Trump-era waiver, expect a regulatory firestorm and market disruption.

Wall Street analysts hold a powerful “Strong Buy” consensus rating for Meta Platforms (META). This overwhelming optimism stems from 46 analyst ratings collected over the past three months. A commanding 42 analysts recommend a Buy, while just 3 advise a Hold, and a mere 1 suggests a Sell.

The average price target for Meta stock sits at $698.07. This implies a modest 0.6% upside from its last trading price of $694.14.

Oops, something went wrong

GameStop (GME) stock plummeted nearly 25% Thursday after the video game seller announced that it intends to sell $1.75 billion worth of convertible bonds.

In other words, GameStop is raising cash from investors by issuing debt in the form of convertible senior notes. Investors will convert the notes into GameStop equity before or when they mature in 2032, diluting shares and potentially weighing on the stock's value.

GameStop said it would use the proceeds of the latest convertible bond sale for investments and potential acquisitions. In May, the company announced a $500 million purchase of bitcoin.

Thursday's announcement follows another big debt offering, with the company selling $1.3 billion of convertible bonds in March.

GameStop is a meme stock known for its unprecedented rally in 2021, driven by retail traders in the Reddit group r/wallstreetbets. In March, the company updated its investment policy to add bitcoin as a "treasury reserve asset," holding the cryptocurrency on its balance sheet as part of its corporate treasury.

Smaller, low-growth companies such as GameStop have been following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor's software firm, Strategy (MSTR), using a combination of debt and equity to add bitcoin to their balance sheet in the hopes of replicating its stock price success.

But investors are wary of such bets because bitcoin can be volatile.

"The main risk in running a leveraged 'bitcoin treasury' strategy is that a rapid drop in the price of bitcoin would lead to a possibility of bankruptcy," NYU Stern School of Business professor David Yermack told Yahoo Finance earlier this month.

Indeed, GameStop's announcement of its bitcoin investment in May sent shares down 10% in one day.

GameStop's revenue has fallen every year since 2023 as video gamers opt for digital game purchases rather than visiting its stores. On Tuesday, the company reported first quarter revenue falling 6% from the prior year to $748 million, sending the stock down 5% the following day.

	The Senate is set to pass the GENIUS Act early next week, a controversial piece of cryptocurrency legislation that critics say will hand an undue amount of financial power to the tech industry. On its face the bill, which has advanced with bipartisan support, purports to offer a regulatory framework for the expansion of “stablecoins,” a form of crypto pegged to an existing, recognized asset — in many cases the U.S. dollar. In reality, it could enable corruption, screw over taxpayers, and potentially destabilize the economy.


	The GENIUS Act would allow banks and private companies to issue stablecoins, essentially their own currencies, with light oversight from regulators. It mandates that issuers of stablecoins hold a reserve of the stable asset backing their cryptocurrency at all times, and that firms abide by certain anti-money laundering laws, as well as U.S. sanctions against foreign entities. 


	It sounds like a step in the right direction, but this piece of legislation is working its way through Congress as sitting President Donald Trump and his family build a cryptocurrency empire that steamrolls anti-corruption laws and ethical norms — one they hope will flourish under the industry-friendly policies and laws created by the administration of the Trump patriarch. 

	











	One of Trump's priorities has been the normalization of these so-called stablecoins — a type of asset that his family is now hawking. Despite the moniker, stablecoins can be extremely unstable. A 2023 study published by the Bank for International Settlements found that of 60 stablecoins analyzed in their review, all of them had become de-pegged from their underlying asset at least once. The 2022 crypto crash was triggered by the failure of Terraform Lab's Terra/Luna “algorithmic” stablecoin — the collapse of which saw $45 billion erased in the span of a week.

	The stablecoin bill comes as the government reorients its approach to crypto. Under the Biden administration, crypto kingpins began to feel the sting of consequences for schemes gone wrong. FTX crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison after carrying out one of the largest financial scams since Enron. Tether, the largest stablecoin in crypto, settled a lawsuit brought against it by New York Attorney General Letitia James in 2021. Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the global crypto exchange Binance, pleaded guilty to money laundering in 2023.

	Trump pledged a new, friendlier regulatory environment in Washington — and the crypto industry poured many millions into Super PACs to elect allies throughout Congress. Now, the industry has its moment to push through a public smokescreen of barely-there regulation, while continuing to rake in the cash. 


	No one has been more outspoken on the failings of the GENIUS Act than Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who told Rolling Stone ahead of key votes that the bill would “create a superhighway for Donald Trump's corruption.” 


	The Trump family's cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial — which is currently being operated by his sons and Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff — recently launched its own stablecoin, designated USD1, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by treasury bonds. The GENIUS Act would allow major tech companies, banks, and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, and many are poised to buy Treasury bonds so they can back the digital currency with real assets, as is required. 


	According to a report issued last week by ARK Invest, the stablecoin market may become one of the largest holders of U.S. debt in the coming years — potentially tying large swaths of U.S. debt to a dubiously regulated and often unstable asset. (For example, if Tether — the largest stablecoins in the market — was a country, it would be the 18th-largest holder of U.S. debt in the world.)

	The lines grow even murkier when considering Trump's habit of using his position in the White House to enrich himself, as well as to tip market scales. World Liberty Financial already landed a $2 billion transaction deal to help an Abu Dhabi-state backed company purchase a stake in the Binance crypto exchange using the USD1 stablecoin. 


	“As soon as the players understand that Trump's intervention is a real possibility, then the stablecoin market is no longer about a careful review of whether there are adequate dollars to back up a particular stablecoin, or whether the stable coin issuer has an AAA rating,” Warren says. “Instead, the whole game becomes one of trying to engage the president to weigh the end and make one set of coins more valuable, and therefore another set of coins less valuable. It's corruption, but it's also a market manipulation that ultimately drains away any development. … It undermines all the markets at that point.” 

	











	Warren compares the development of the GENIUS Act to efforts to regulate derivatives and the feverish rise of money market mutual funds in the early 2000s, both of which were major factors in the 2008 financial crisis: “The derivatives industry came to the Congress and said, ‘Regulate us,' and they wrote a sample. They wrote the regulation, and Congress — not knowing much about that world — passed it.”


	The consequence was, in Warren's view, that lay people believed the industry to be effectively regulated, when in reality investors essentially tailored legislation to their own priorities. “The risk kept building in the system until in 2008 it blew up the entire economy and required a $700 billion bailout from taxpayers,” Warren says. “So think about why an industry comes to Congress and says, ‘Regulate us.' They want the imprimatur, they want the gold seal of the United States government. … They don't actually want the government to oversee the activities of the industry.” 


	Warren is not alone in her concerns, and has found an unexpected ally in Republican Sen. John Hawley of Missouri. Last week, Hawley described the GENIUS Act as a “huge giveaway to Big Tech” that would effectively allow private tech companies to create their own currencies that compete with the dollar. 


	“The U.S. dollar is the reserve currency,” Warren says. “The United States does not gain from creating a competing electronic currency. Getting more people to hold stable coins rather than dollars during their investment transactions, does not serve us interests, but it injects risk into the U.S.” 


	“Anyone who thinks that when a financial crash hits [the value of stablecoins] will translate one to one into dollars is fooling themselves,” she adds.


	The ripple effects can be catastrophic when a stablecoin collapses. Existing stablecoins are already buying up billions in Treasury bonds, and in the event of a run on a coin, or any type of collapse within stablecoin, the issuer would sell off their own holdings — in this case Treasury bonds — to pay back their customers. Economists warn that such a scenario could destabilize the underlying treasury securities market that serves as the foundation of the U.S. economy. 


	As Warren and Hawley point out, the risks of economic destabilization increase significantly if legislation like the GENIUS Act passes. PayPal has already launched its own cryptocurrency, and Apple, Facebook, X, and Airbnb have all explored releasing their own stablecoins for customers to conduct on-platform transactions in crypto. 

	











	If, for example, Elon Musk “is controlling a significant portion of cash-light money moving through our economy and X gets in trouble, the federal government will face the possibility of bailing out not just the coin, but the underlying business, because they're so deeply intertwined,” Warren explains. 


	“There's a reason why there has always been a wall between banking and commerce,” Warren says. “This GENIUS Act, for the first time, destroys that wall.” 


	Nothing is too big to fail. Seemingly secure, lucrative schemes have left the U.S. and global economy in ruins. 


	In a way, the GENIUS Act has already built in a bailout fund for crypto traders should the bubble pop: your deposits.

	A provision in the bill mandates that financial institutions issuing the coins prioritize reimbursing stablecoin holders over other checking and savings depositors in the event that the bank or financial institution becomes insolvent. Essentially, as Georgetown Law professor Adam Levitin wrote last month, “Congress is about to put the claims of stablecoin investors ahead of ma and pa's bank deposits.”


	Because most standard bank deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the result is that depositors' checking and savings would be used to pay off lost crypto holdings and everyone else can file for an insurance claim. “Which means,” Warren warns, “the U.S. taxpayer is right in the crosshairs.”

Bitcoin (BTC) failed to hold above $110,000 following the sentiment-fuelled rally earlier this week, which broadly lifted cryptocurrency prices. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has continued to lose strength over the last two days, currently trading at around $107,399 at the time of writing on Thursday.

Major altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), which had previously offered bullish signals alongside BTC, are now starting to show weakness amid swelling bearish biases. Key attributes for this lackluster price action have primarily been the lack of risk appetite, as sentiment remains strikingly cautious, as per the K33 Research “Ahead of the Curve” report released on Tuesday.

Data spotlight: BTC and ETH spot ETF inflows charge as prices falter

Sentiment in the institutional arena has remained relatively high following the announcement of the recently concluded trade talks between the United States (US) and China. This has positively influenced spot Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs) inflows despite waning retail interest.

According to SoSoValue, BTC spot ETFs saw approximately $165 million daily total net inflows on Wednesday, significantly below Tuesday's volume of $431 million. BlackRock's IBIT led the other ETF products with $131 million streaming in, followed by VanEck's HODL at a distant $15 million.

Institutional interest in Ethereum has steadied since mid-May, with ETH spot ETFs posting 17 consecutive days of inflows. On Wednesday, inflows into the regulated products, allowing investors to seek exposure via stock exchanges without owning the digital token, surged to $240 million, surpassing the $125 million recorded on Tuesday. The persistent increase in ETF inflows suggests that investors see immense potential in the Ethereum price.

Bitcoin hovered near all-time highs of $111,980 earlier this week, but market sentiment remained alarmingly cautious, possibly due to uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. 

“Funding rates and leverage indicators across platforms point to sustained defensiveness, with Binance's BTC/USDT perpetuals averaging negative daily funding on Friday and Sunday,” a K33 Research analyst said in the report. “Over the past week, average funding rates sat at just 1.3% annualized, levels only seen near local bottoms over the last 2.5 years,” the analysts added.

At the same time, the Bitcoin futures contracts' Open Interest (OI) has remained relatively subdued over the last few weeks, or since BTC hit all-time highs. CoinGlass data, as shown in the chart below, indicates that the OI is near $74 billion, down from approximately $80 billion as of May 23.

OI refers to the number of outstanding futures and options contracts that have yet to be settled or closed. A low or declining OI indicates that interest among traders is decreasing, and if coupled with softer trading volumes, it could hinder the price from edging higher.

The path of least resistance is gradually shifting downward, especially with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) falling to the 50 midline from its recent peak of 64 on the daily chart. Traders would look for a confirmation of a sell signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator to ascertain the bearish momentum. This signal manifests when the blue MACD line crosses below the red signal line.

BTC/USDT daily chart 

Crypto investor and analyst Michaël van de Poppe said via an X post that since Bitcoin's price failed to gain strength above $110,000, a correction is expected. He added that as long as BTC holds above the $106,000 support level, investors don't need to worry. 



Still, it would be prudent to cautiously prepare for a sweep through the next key support at the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $102,472, which is 4.6% below the current price level.

The largest smart contacts token by market capitalization, Ethereum, trades at $2,747 at the time of writing, down nearly 1% on the day and 4.6% from its recent high of $2,881 reached on Wednesday.

Based on the MACD indicator, the pullback could continue, especially if traders follow the sell signal confirmed on Thursday to reduce exposure to ETH. Although the RSI holds sideways at 56, it has retreated from overbought levels, signaling that bulls may give up.

Key levels of interest to traders include the 4-hour 50-period EMA at approximately $2,646, the 100-period EMA at $2,597, and the 200-period EMA at $2,488, which are poised to act as support levels if the decline accelerates.

ETH/USDT & XRP/USDT 4-hour charts

On the other hand, the price of XRP remains below the 4-hour 50-period EMA, which converges with the 100-period EMA at around $2.25 to form a confluence of resistance. A break above this level would encounter the 200-period EMA resistance at $2.26.

The MACD sell signal, as shown on the chart above, hints at an extended downtrend. With the red histogram bars expanding below the mean line (0.00), declines could gain traction in upcoming sessions. 

Areas such as $2.19, 2% below the current price, and $2.07, which holds 7% under the prevailing market level, stand out as key downside targets for XRP. The cross-border money remittance token upside remains strongly limited despite surging institutional interest and adoption.

Higher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market. This is considered the equivalent of increase in efficiency and the ongoing trend continues. When Open Interest decreases, it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market, investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors.

Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike. A consistently negative funding rate for an asset implies a bearish sentiment, indicating that traders expect the cryptocurrency's price to fall and a bearish trend reversal is likely to occur.

 Outgoing FSB Chair Klaas Knot says stablecoins and ETFs are accelerating crypto's integration into traditional finance, raising systemic risk concerns. 

The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is sounding the alarm on growing risks from the crypto sector, warning that interlinkages with traditional finance are nearing a critical threshold.

Speaking in Madrid on Thursday, outgoing FSB Chair Klaas Knot said that while crypto does not yet pose a systemic risk to traditional finance, that status may not last much longer. “We may be approaching a tipping point here,” he said.

Knot noted that entry barriers for retail investors have “dropped significantly,” particularly with the introduction of crypto exchange-traded funds. Crypto ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to digital assets without managing private keys, using crypto wallets or navigating exchanges.

Knot added that another area of concern is the stablecoin market. He noted that issuers now hold large amounts of US Treasurys, which increases interlinkages between crypto and traditional finance. “That's a segment that we clearly must monitor closely,” he added.

Stablecoins — digital assets pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar — are becoming increasingly embedded into financial systems. According to data from DefiLlama, the total market cap of stablecoins is more than $251 billion.

A recent research paper by the Bank for International Settlements analyzed the growing impact of stablecoins on traditional finance, focusing on their influence on short-term US Treasury yields.

By using daily data from 2021 to 2025 and an instrumental variable method, the paper found that stablecoin inflows lower three-month Treasury yields by 2–2.5 basis points within 10 days, while outflows raise yields by 6–8 basis points.

These effects are concentrated in short-term maturities, with minimal impact on longer-term bonds. Among issuers, USDt (USDT) has the largest effect, followed by Circle's USDC (USDC), confirming the influence of stablecoins in Treasury markets.

Knot, who also serves as president of the Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank, will step down from both roles on June 30. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey is set to succeed him at the FSB, while the Netherlands has yet to appoint a replacement.

On Wednesday, the US Senate voted 68–30 to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, a key stablecoin bill aimed at establishing regulatory clarity for dollar-backed digital assets. The vote paves the way for floor debate and a final vote before the bill moves to the House of Representatives.

If passed, the bill would create a national framework for stablecoin issuance, boosting the US digital asset industry's global competitiveness.

An increasing number of blockchains is actively seeking to integrate AI capabilities, but this “AI on blockchain” growth is accompanied by significant challenges, most notably the issue of "chain silos", which fragment the sector and can hold back the full realization and utility of Decentralized AI (DeAI) potential. Afterall, if there's no widely available use case scenario, how do we continue the narrative and innovation of the currently already-overhyped DeAI sector?

Take blockchain-native autonomous AI agents as an example, while a precise census of AI agents on the blockchain is elusive, the available data strongly suggests a rapidly growing and dynamic landscape. The number is likely in the hundreds to potentially thousands when considering individual deployed agents across various platforms and projects. All these AI agents reside in a scattered landscape of chains. It's like when computers could not communicate with other computers before the World Wide Web was invented, as a result, the full potential of computers could not be unleashed.

While centralized AI suffers from data silos controlled by corporations, DeAI risks creating new silos at the blockchain level if interoperability is not prioritized, blocking DeAI's full potential.

This fragmentation is not merely about data residing on different ledgers. It extends to the unique protocols, smart contract languages, virtual machine environments, consensus mechanisms, and overall operational logic of each distinct blockchain.

For example, a DeAI application built to leverage the specific features of Ethereum and its EVM may not be able to natively interact with or utilize AI models deployed on a non-EVM chain like Solana without resorting to complex and potentially insecure bridging solutions. Similarly, AI agents trained within one chain's environment may find it difficult to operate effectively elsewhere. This leads to scenarios where separate databases or non-communicating tools on different chains effectively become isolated islands of DeAI activity.

Fragmentation issues, similar to those seen in decentralized identity systems or healthcare electronic health records due to platform incompatibilities, can limit the scalability and impact of DeAI solutions.

The DeAI community's vision extends beyond isolated applications on single blockchains. Building "Super AI Applications" is becoming a key mission for many.

Imagine it as an all-encompassing platform or a network of integrated services that accommodates diverse AI functionalities – such as sophisticated data analysis, distributed model training, autonomous agent deployment, and complex decision making – across different, often varied and disparate blockchain environments. Such an application would not be confined to the resources or limitations of a single chain.

On one hand, specialized Layer 1 blockchains like Bittensor, and Gensyn are being engineered from the ground up with DeAI specific requirements in mind. These platforms aim to provide optimized environments for tasks like high-volume data processing, intensive computation, or unique AI model incentive mechanisms, based on the premise that general-purpose L1s may not be ideally suited for the distinct demands of DeAI.

On the other hand, many prominent DeAI Apps and protocols, such as Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET, initially launched on established, general-purpose L1s like Ethereum and are now pursuing multichain strategies.

Then a key debate arose: Commit to a specialized L1 for potentially superior tailored performance but a smaller initial ecosystem, or build on/across established L1s/L2s to tap into broader reach but with possible limitations in AI specific optimizations?

Inevitably, successful DeAI platforms will increasingly rely on reliable and functional cross-chain capabilities to access wider markets, liquidity, and data sources, regardless of their foundational architecture, thereby avoiding the very “silo-zation” they aim to overcome.

Realizing the Super AI APP vision is charged with significant challenges though.

Despite these challenges, industry players are proactively exploring solutions and standardization for DeAI Super Applications to cross chain, including leaders like BSC and Solana, although this is still at an infant stage. In the meantime, innovations in protocols, platforms, and conceptual frameworks are also taking shape to construct a more interconnected DeAI ecosystem which can potentially become real utility for even novice internet users. This trend is inevitable, driven by the enormous potential underneath AI and blockchain's synergistic benefits. The inherent characteristics of blockchain can address some of AI's most pressing challenges, while AI can unlock new functionalities and efficiencies for decentralized systems, such as network optimization and intelligent resource allocation, or automated security auditing, and more. For the benefits and advantages of AI on blockchain over centralized AI, I've discussed in my previous articles:

Ether( ETH) ETH$2,766.10 struggled to maintain Tuesday's momentum, falling 0.15% to $2,758 amid selling pressure that emerged during U.S. afternoon trading on June 11. 

The pullback followed a brief rally to $2,872.42, which proved unsustainable as price action reversed sharply between 15:00 and 17:00 UTC, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. 

The late-session sell-off intensified in early Asia hours, punctuated by a 1.29% dip from $2,772 to $2,736 on heavy volume, before ether rebounded slightly toward $2,758 at press time.

Despite the downturn, key metrics suggest rising conviction among bulls. 

Glassnode reported that options skew flipped sharply negative over the past 48 hours—one-week skew dropping from –2.4% to –7.0% — indicating increased demand for short-dated calls. Put-call ratios remain heavily tilted toward upside exposure, with open interest and volume ratios holding near multi-week lows.

On-chain flows also reinforced the bullish bias. 

Analytics firm Sentora (formerly, IntoTheBlock) flagged that over 140,000 ETH, worth approximately $393 million, was withdrawn from exchanges on June 11 — the largest single-day outflow in more than a month. 

Simultaneously, ETH-based ETFs extended their inflow streak with another $240.3 million added Wednesday, surpassing the day's Bitcoin ETF totals. Analyst Anthony Sassano noted that Ethereum has avoided a single net outflow day since mid-May, calling the trend “accelerating” and arguing that the asset remains structurally undervalued.

While price action shows short-term weakness, market positioning and capital flows suggest traders may be buying the dip in anticipation of another upside attempt.

Helping Shape the European Financial Services Industry Since 2002

Privy, established just over three years ago, offers a single API solution that enables developers to create products utilising cryptocurrency technology.

Payments firm Stripe has reached an agreement to acquire the crypto wallet infrastructure startup Privy, marking a significant step in its renewed focus on cryptocurrency following a six-year break.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

This acquisition follows Stripe's recent $1.1bn purchase of stablecoin platform Bridge, furthering its strategic expansion into the digital currency sector.

Privy, founded slightly over three years ago, has developed a single API solution that facilitates developers in creating products using crypto technology. This infrastructure allows clients to establish wallets, conduct transactions, and integrate any on-chain systems seamlessly, thereby eliminating the need for external wallets.

The company claims to support over 75 million accounts across more than 1,000 developer teams, handling billions in transactions for clients such as trading platform Hyperliquid and restaurant app Blackbird.

Upon completion of the acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions expected to conclude in upcoming weeks, Privy will continue to function independently under the Stripe umbrella.

Privy founders Henri Stern and Asta Li said: “Joining Stripe will accelerate our work to shape this future and provide powerful new capabilities to Stripe and Privy customers alike. Together, we can change how value moves through the Internet.”

The acquisition is seen as a boost for both companies. It is anticipated that Privy's technology will be leveraged by Stripe to integrate new capabilities for its customers, enhancing user experience and potentially driving further adoption of digital assets.

In April 2025, Bridge entered into a partnership with Visa to launch a new card-issuing product linked to stablecoins. Through this partnership with Lead Bank as a financial institution partner, fintech developers can offer stablecoin-linked Visa cards globally through a single API integration.

              Highlights            



                        Project Agora, led by the BIS and seven central banks, aims to create a unified, programmable financial ledger combining tokenized commercial bank deposits with wholesale central bank money — challenging the role of stablecoins in regulated finance.                      


                        The initiative provides a credible, regulated alternative to private stablecoins for cross-border and institutional payments, potentially redefining how programmable money is used without relying on crypto-native infrastructure.                      


                        While stablecoins offer speed and global reach, their lack of regulation and transparency invites scrutiny, and Project Agora raises the bar by embedding compliance and trust into digital money systems, pressuring stablecoins to evolve or risk obsolescence in institutional finance.                      

In the digital age, banks and other traditional financial incumbents face the core challenge of building or being built upon.

This challenge is coming to a head in the stablecoins sector, but legacy players may have a trick hidden up their sleeves. While cryptocurrency has tried for over a decade to integrate within the traditional, U.S.-driven financial system, banks themselves have been innovating in the meantime.

It was just over a year ago that the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and seven global central banks announced Project Agora, Greek for “marketplace,” a collaborative initiative to build a multicurrency unified ledger that merges tokenized commercial bank deposits with wholesale central bank money, all on a programmable platform featuring smart contracts.

The interplay between Project Agora's outcomes and the potentially broader integration of stablecoins across the U.S. market could represent a potential inflection point in the evolution of digital money.

While stablecoins — especially fiat-backed tokens like USDC, USDT and others — have long been heralded as the future of seamless, global, programmable value transfer, Project Agora's goal challenges their relevance, particularly in the institutional, cross-border and regulated financial sphere.

Project Agora is a bank consortium blockchain pilot grounded in a two-tier monetary system. Central banks will continue to issue wholesale central bank money, while commercial banks maintain their role as deposit issuers. The innovation lies in tokenizing these liabilities and integrating them on a shared blockchain ledger where smart contracts can automate compliance steps, payments and settlement sequencing.

The project incorporates central banks, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Bank of England, Bank of France, Bank of Japan, Bank of Korea, Bank of Mexico and the Swiss National Bank. These banks will engage with private sector banks like Citi, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, Lloyds Bank and global infrastructure providers such as SWIFT, Euroclear, SDX, Visa and Mastercard — all brought together by the Institute of International Finance (IIF).

“We will not just test the technology, we will test it within the specific operational, regulatory and legal conditions of the participating currencies, together with financial companies operating in them,” BIS Innovation Hub Head Cecilia Skingsley said in a statement when Project Agora was announced April 3, 2024.

BIS Economic Adviser and Head of Research Hyun Song Shin said at the time: “These functionalities will come without sacrificing the safeguards on the integrity and governance of the monetary system.”

Therein crystallizes the crucial question of the project: Can programmable fiat act as a middle ground — combining the control and trust of regulated money with the innovation engine of blockchain-powered money? Project Agora reflects banks retaking the narrative that programmable, efficient money doesn't require crypto-native infrastructure.

If yes, it could redefine how global value moves and render stablecoins, the original disruptors, either regulated, repurposed or irrelevant across many institutional payment contexts. That's a big if, in more ways than one. But it's one that Rohit Chopra, who was the third director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and previous member of the Federal Trade Commission, pointed to at a May stablecoin conference where he advocated for tokenized bank deposits of U.S. fiat to form the backing of a U.S. stablecoin.

In recent years, private stablecoins have upped their threats to bypass slower traditional rails by offering near-instant settlements, broad global reach and user-friendly programmability. These digital currencies have underlined gaps in cross-border systems and pushed incumbents to adapt.

Yet stablecoins also raise systemic risks, such as reserve opacity, regulatory arbitrage and concentration of private power. These private stablecoins are largely unregulated and now settle billions of dollars in daily transactions across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and exchanges, and increasingly mainstream commerce occasions.

Such concerns have prompted central banks to accelerate work on digital versions of their own currencies.

Project Agora is seeking to address the wholesale heart of cross-border systems. By offering tokenized central bank money alongside commercial tokens on a shared digital infrastructure, banks may be able to crowd out private stablecoins for interbank and institutional transfers, without ceding oversight or public trust.

Agora doesn't kill stablecoins. But by offering a credible, supervised alternative, it raises the bar, forcing private issuance to compete on compliance, resilience and institutional usability rather than just speed.

While the work remains experimental, it is designed to produce real, testable code and real-world flows.

Ethereum (ETH) briefly moved above $2,850 on Wednesday following its futures open interest (OI) rising to an all-time high of 15.21 million ETH. The OI rise is accompanied by major inflows into accumulation addresses in the past week.

Ethereum has seen a 12% gain over the past three days, following a surge in its futures open interest, which jumped by 1.57 million ETH to an all-time high of 15.21 million ETH. Coupled with the OI growth, funding rates have also seen a slight uptick, indicating a rising appetite for risk among ETH investors.

Notably, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) accounted for the majority of the ETH OI growth among top exchanges, with the Volatility Shares 2x leveraged ETH ETF (ETHU) as the primary source of the increase. This shows that institutional investors are driving the demand for leverage.

Between April 8 and June 9, the ETH equivalent exposure of ETHU increased by 305,100 ETH, while the CME's ETH OI rose by 295,250 ETH, according to a K33 Research report on Tuesday.

"In other words, without VolatilityShares, CME's ETH OI would have declined by 9,850 ETH over the past two months. It is concerning to see one single entity cornering such a massive share of the market on CME, and it originates from a bunch of traders thirsting for leveraged long exposure in ETH," the report states.

Buying pressure in US spot Ethereum ETFs has also been consistent, recording net inflows of $124.93 million on Tuesday and extending their positive streak to 17 consecutive days, according to SoSoValue data.

A similar bullish structure is evident in ETH accumulation addresses, recording large inflows above 400K ETH in five out of the last seven days. Accumulation addresses are addresses that have never sold/distributed any token — with newly created addresses forming a majority of them.

Meanwhile, ETH could see increased volatility with prices rising above $2,800 as it has the second-highest volume and third-largest OI by strike price in the options market, per Laevitas.ch data. An option contract is in the money or in profit if the underlying asset moves above its strike price, increasing the chances of profit-taking.

Ethereum sustained $111.56 million in futures liquidations, with long and short liquidations reaching $64.26 million and $47.29 million, respectively, in the past 24 hours, according to Coinglass data.

After flipping the upper boundary of a key channel, Ethereum briefly moved above the $2,850 key resistance on Wednesday  — the first time since February 4.

The top altcoin has also risen above the cost basis of about 2.1 million ETH purchased around $2,700 - $2,760, per Glassnode data. On the upside, ETH faces no critical resistance until it approaches the $3,400 level. This also aligns with its cost basis being evenly distributed until it approaches $3,417.

"If the $2.70K–$2.76K support range holds, the path to $3.42K remains technically open - but the response from holders in the $2.8K–$3.3K range will define how quickly $ETH can climb," noted Glassnode in a Wednesday's X post.

In the short term, ETH could see a resistance near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $3,078 if it recovers the $2,850 level. The upward momentum is strengthened by ETH rising above its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a move that often precedes a strong uptrend for the top altcoin.

On the downside, ETH could find support at the 200-day SMA, if it maintains the rejection at $2,850. A decline below this level could send ETH toward $2,500.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is testing its overbought region line. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is attempting a crossover above its moving average line after its histogram flipped positive. A crossover will strengthen the bullish momentum.

Physicist Werner Heisenberg is said to have made his breakthrough in quantum mechanics while visiting the island of Heligoland in 1925. Credit: Günter Gräfenhain/mauritius images via Alamy

As the ferry pulled into the dock at the North Sea island of Heligoland, I wondered: did German wunderkind Werner Heisenberg — who famously formulated the mathematics behind quantum physics here in 1925 — also arrive wanting to throw up?

The choppy four-hour journey from Hamburg was unpleasant, but perhaps a small price to pay for an invite to the physics event of the year. I am one of some 300 people, including at least four Nobel laureates, who have descended on the remote island (population 1,253) for a conference dubbed by one of its organisers as the birthday party of quantum mechanics.

How quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago

How quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago

Legend has it that 100 years ago this week, 23-year-old Heisenberg came to the island to escape his debilitating hay fever (some sources say the island hosted just one tree – I can report that I have seen at least four). Unable to sleep, he is said to have sketched out his ideas late into the night before reaching an epiphany. He then roamed the island, shaken, before watching the sunrise from the top of a rock. 

Heisenberg's insight was that electrons around an atom — whose orbits had puzzled physicists with conflicting predictions and measurements — should be defined by only observables; their leaps and transitions, instead of trajectories. This required developing a specific kind of mathematics called matrix mechanics that helped to shepherd in a new, quantum, era in physics.

The young physicist's revelation on this remote island is a beautiful and somewhat mythical image. As highlighted by science writer Philip Ball at the conference dinner, Heisenberg himself was unsure of the magnitude of what he had done, writing to his father on his return that “my own work is not going at the moment especially well”. It was only once built upon by his collaborators Max Born and Pascual Jordan, that Heisenberg's work became a complete formulation of mechanics.

But people who want a birthday party need to pick a date. And now that I am here I can see that Heligoland's stark red cliffs and stiff breeze makes it a perfect place to roam, contemplate and hope that some of Heisenberg's genius rubs off.

Down every street and in every café sit physicists, their conference lanyards swinging, huddled in conversation. My server asks me what we're all doing here. “Quantum physics!” I say with glee. A local man who studies wildlife at the Biological Institute Heligoland told me he could spot fellow scientists among the islanders.

To encourage conversation and revelation, the conference schedule is bizarre. After the morning session talks adjourn until til 7pm, to give ample time to explore the tiny island. Heligoland's fame goes well beyond quantum mechanics. Over the centuries the island has swapped between British, Danish and German rule, and it is a haven for seals and rare seabirds. In 1947 it was half obliterated by the largest non-nuclear explosion in history, when the British Royal Navy blew it up to prevent it being used as a German military base.

Astronomers have surveyed massive, dense star factories, unlike any found in the Milky Way, in a large number of galaxies across the local universe. The findings provide a rare glimpse into processes shaping galaxies in the very early universe and possibly the Milky Way a few billion years from now.

Known as luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, or LIRGs and ULIRGs, these galaxies are relatively rare in the local universe, with only 202 known within 400 megaparsecs (1.3 billion light-years) from Earth, according to Sean Linden, a research associate at the University of Arizona Steward Observatory, who presented the findings during a press briefing at the 246th meeting of the American Astronomical Society on June 11.

LIRGs and ULIRGs differ from spiral galaxies like the Milky Way in that they are in the process of merging with other galaxies. Most exhibit features such as two galactic nuclei instead of one or extended "tails" as gravity stretches and deforms the two objects. And unlike "modern" galaxies, they contain "clumps" - dense regions brimming with newborn stars, much more massive than anything found in "typical," evolved galaxies that are not undergoing mergers.

"These galaxies are very clumpy, very different from the beautiful spiral galaxies that we see now, such as the Milky Way," Linden said. "And we know from cosmological simulations that these clumps were the building blocks of galaxies in the early universe."

Astronomers are interested in LIRGs and ULIRGs because they serve as windows into a distant past when the universe was much younger and galaxies were much less evolved and crashed into each other much more frequently than today.

This is where the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey comes in, or GOALS for short. It combines imaging and spectroscopic data from NASA's Spitzer, Hubble, Chandra and GALEX spaceborne observatories in a comprehensive study of more than 200 of the most luminous infrared-selected galaxies in the local universe. Now, infrared observations with NASA's James Webb Space Telescope have provided the most complete census of these galaxies. Running from October 2023 until September 2024, the survey is the only of its kind. The team plans to publish the results in a forthcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal.

"You can imagine a million suns forming in one small, compact region, and within one of those galaxies, there are hundreds of thousands of such clumps," Linden said.

For comparison, the most massive young clumps in the Milky Way have masses of about 1,000 suns and, on average, one star is born each year.

When two galaxies collide and merge, star formation rates increase dramatically, Linden explained, resulting in the massive clumps that are not seen in other galaxies that are not undergoing mergers.

"These clumpy structures build up over time until they become incredibly massive, and if we want to understand them and how they actually contribute to galaxies evolving throughout cosmic time, we need to study them in detail," Linden said.

Although star-forming clumps had already been observed with the Hubble Space Telescope, only the infrared capabilities of JWST allowed astronomers to pull aside the veils of thick dust that had prevented them from obtaining a more detailed look at these features.

The survey results also confirm predictions of galaxy evolution based on simulations done by supercomputers, which predicted that "typical," disk-like galaxies contain fewer clumps of star formation, and most of the star formation happens in small clumps, as seen in the Milky Way today. Mergers produce bigger clumps, and more of them, and more of the star formation takes place in the massive clumps.

"We're now finding these massive clumps in the local universe," Linden said. "We are beginning to complete the picture by comparing for the first time observations of massive clumps from both the nearby and the distant universe."

Being able to discern previously hidden details in these unusually massive star-forming clumps helps researchers better understand how these features and their host galaxies evolved over time, essentially providing a natural laboratory for a type of galaxy that for the most part no longer exists in the universe except for its most distant, outer regions.

"In a sense, you look at the local universe, and it gives you information about what would have happened 10 billion years ago," said Linden, whose work focused on imaging the clumps and the star clusters, and who led the data acquisition, reduction and analysis.

The early universe was much denser, he explained, and mergers between galaxies happened much more frequently, producing massive star-forming clumps. As the universe evolved and space expanded, the galaxies became more and more like the Milky Way and the mature spiral galaxies we see today.

"The universe used to be much more violent and extreme in the past, and it's now settling down," Linden said. "That's why these rare examples of extreme galaxies no longer exist in the local universe, because, by and large, most galaxies have settled down as well."

In addition to providing windows into the past, the surveyed galaxies also hint at the future, Linden said. At some point, the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are going to collide, over the course of several billions of years, and when that happens, the merger could ignite another round of massive star formation in both galaxies.

"As Andromeda gets closer and the pressure in the interstellar medium goes up, all of a sudden, the clumps that you will find that the Milky Way is forming will be more and more massive."

That's a lot of lost loot.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Exploration of the San Jose shipwreck and the precious metal coins it scattered about 1,970 feet below the ocean's surface off the coast of Colombia confirmed it really was the richest shipwreck in the world. 

Considered the Holy Grail of all shipwrecks, the Spanish galleon San Jose blew up and sank in 1708 at the hands of British cannons, and it took with it what experts have estimated to be $17 billion in modern-day wealth, largely in the form of coins from 10 years of taxes saved up from the Americas. The shipwreck was first located in 2015.

A new study published in the journal Antiquity showed how using remotely operated vehicles allowed researchers to get close to the underwater coins and confirm that the wreck found in 2015—which launched a custody battle between Colombia and Spain—really is the long-sought San Jose with an untold number of coins still on the seafloor. 

“Among the key finds are hand-struck, irregularly shaped coins—known as cobs in English and macuquinas in Spanish—that served as the primary currency in the Americas for more than two centuries,” the study's lead author, Daniela Vargas Ariza, wrote about the coins often cut from gold or silver ingots. Ariza is a maritime archaeologist at Colombia's Almirante Padilla Naval Cadet School in Cartagena and the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History in Bogota.

The exact number of coins visible is difficult to determine due to the nature of the underwater site, but the cobs identified in high-resolution photos taken by the ROV show they have an average diameter of 1.3 inches and weigh 27 grams. At an estimated 200 tons of gold, silver, and uncut gemstones, that's a lot of wealth in the water. 

The photographs did help add some detail to what's known about the shipwreck's treasure. One side of the coins featured a Jerusalem Cross—a large cross with four smaller crosses—along with a shield featuring a castle and lions within a dotted border. On the flip side, the central design features the Pillars of Hercules above waves of the sea. The researchers said the design of the waves offers an identifying element for coins coming from the Lima Mint. Coins also feature marks of an assayer—an expert who tests metal purity—hammered on the edges. 

The researchers believe the evidence gleaned from the cobs help substantiate the long-held hypothesis that this wreck truly is the San Jose. “This case study highlights the value of coins as key chronological markers in the identification of shipwrecks, particularly those from the Tierra Firme Fleet,” Ariza wrote. 

The sinking of the ship at this site must have occurred after 1707, the year the coins were minted. This, along with the presence of Chinese porcelain from the Kangzi period of 1662-1722 A.D. and the inscriptions on the cannon dating to 1665, suggest the ship sank in the early 18th century.

The features on the coins also helped determine the route taken by the sunken vessel, including how the cobs were likely sourced from Peruvian mines (minting of gold coins began at the Lima Mint in 1696). 

There's also historical context important in identifying the wreck. In 1706, the Viceroy Marques de Castelldosrius arrived in Peru to reactivate the Portobello fair and send accumulated taxes of a decade to the Iberian Peninsula. In late 1707, Peruvian merchants and officials traveled to Puerto Perico on the Pacific coast of Panama, according to the study. 

There, they met the Tierra Firme Fleet, commanded by the galleon San Jose, which held the monopoly on transporting royal treasures between South America and the Iberian Peninsula. After the Portobello fair, the San Jose departed for Cartagena carrying goods and metals, including the cobs.

“The San Jose Galleon,” the authors wrote, “is the only ship that matches these characteristics.”

Cobs were the primary way the Spanish transported large volumes of wealth from the Americas to Europe, so these coin hoards likely formed part of the royal treasure dispatched from Peru by Castelldosrius. But when the fleet of 18 ships left Cartagena bound for Spain on June 8, 1708, it was attacked by five British warships during the War of the Spanish Succession. The cannon battle resulted in the exploding of San Jose's gunpowder stores, sinking the 150-foot-long ship.

“The new coin straddles two eras, the Pagan and the Christian.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A gold shilling located by a metal detectorist near Norwich may be no larger than a fingernail, but it wields quite a bit of history—and some distinct designs. The small gold coin discovered in the fall has led coin expert Adrian Marsden of the Norfolk Historic Environment Service to research the unique emblems marking the coin. 

He published his view on the find in The Searcher, highlighting that the coin is the first of its kind ever found. “It's of a wholly new type, undoubtedly English—and East Anglian,” he wrote, adding that it's likely from the seventh century A.D., likely between 640 and 660 A.D., when Pagan beliefs were giving way to Christianity in Britain. 

Located in an area that has yielded other seventh-century coins, the decorated schilling is connected to a series of shillings Marsden has seen before. But this one is still in a class on its own, thanks in part to the design that packs plenty in a small space. “The obverse of this one has a man, with a rather oversized head, performing what appears to be a jig with his legs crossed whilst placing a cross, held out in his left hand, over an odd design composed of three interlocked triangles,” Marsden wrote. 

He said the Christian elements with the cross are obvious, inspired by the standard depiction of Christian emperors of the late Roman empire. The interlinked triangles are better known as a valknut, he said, a pagan design that has an uncertain meaning. They could be associated with the Scandinavian god Odin, who helped bring the dead to the afterlife, but the expert calls that “speculation,” since nobody is quite sure what the valknut—the word is a modern compound meaning knot of those fallen in battle—symbol really stands for. 

The other side includes a cross-like design enclosed by a border of small pellets. The questions surrounding the symbolism point to a time where both Pagan and Christian images were used, Marsden says. The unique design could be a form of a cross or even a swastika, which at the time was likely a good luck symbol. The coin also had a poor attempt at a Latin-style inscription that Marsden said really didn't amount to any language.

The coin was tested for purity, and all results rendered it with a gold content of over 56 percent to over 60 percent, in line with a modern-day wedding ring, giving the coin a pure look that would have likely been uncommon in the seventh century. 

Under the nation's updated Treasure Act, the coin will likely be displayed at a museum, possibly the Norwich Castle Museum. 

“I think that this shilling does stand at the head of an East Anglian Royal coinage that quickly—as the kingdom became Christian—got rid of the valknut and retained the cross,” Marsden surmised about the provenance. “The new coin straddles two eras, the Pagan and the Christian.”

Brain Implant Lets Man with ALS Speak and Sing with His ‘Real Voice'

A new brain-computer interface turns thoughts into singing and expressive speech in real time

A man with a severe speech disability is able to speak expressively and sing using a brain implant that translates his neural activity into words almost instantly. The device conveys changes of tone when he asks questions, emphasizes the words of his choice and allows him to hum a string of notes in three pitches.

The system — known as a brain–computer interface (BCI) — used artificial intelligence (AI) to decode the participant's electrical brain activity as he attempted to speak. The device is the first to reproduce not only a person's intended words but also features of natural speech such as tone, pitch and emphasis, which help to express meaning and emotion.

In a study, a synthetic voice that mimicked the participant's own spoke his words within 10 milliseconds of the neural activity that signalled his intention to speak. The system, described today in Nature, marks a significant improvement over earlier BCI models, which streamed speech within three seconds or produced it only after users finished miming an entire sentence.

“This is the holy grail in speech BCIs,” says Christian Herff, a computational neuroscientist at Maastricht University, the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study. “This is now real, spontaneous, continuous speech.”

The study participant, a 45-year-old man, lost his ability to speak clearly after developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a form of motor neuron disease, which damages the nerves that control muscle movements, including those needed for speech. Although he could still make sounds and mouth words, his speech was slow and unclear.

Five years after his symptoms began, the participant underwent surgery to insert 256 silicon electrodes, each 1.5-mm long, in a brain region that controls movement. Study co-author Maitreyee Wairagkar, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Davis, and her colleagues trained deep-learning algorithms to capture the signals in his brain every 10 milliseconds. Their system decodes, in real time, the sounds the man attempts to produce rather than his intended words or the constituent phonemes — the subunits of speech that form spoken words.

“We don't always use words to communicate what we want. We have interjections. We have other expressive vocalizations that are not in the vocabulary,” explains Wairagkar. “In order to do that, we have adopted this approach, which is completely unrestricted.”

The team also personalized the synthetic voice to sound like the man's own, by training AI algorithms on recordings of interviews he had done before the onset of his disease.

The team asked the participant to attempt to make interjections such as ‘aah', ‘ooh' and ‘hmm' and say made-up words. The BCI successfully produced these sounds, showing that it could generate speech without needing a fixed vocabulary.

Using the device, the participant spelt out words, responded to open-ended questions and said whatever he wanted, using some words that were not part of the decoder's training data. He told the researchers that listening to the synthetic voice produce his speech made him “feel happy” and that it felt like his “real voice”.

In other experiments, the BCI identified whether the participant was attempting to say a sentence as a question or as a statement. The system could also determine when he stressed different words in the same sentence and adjust the tone of his synthetic voice accordingly. “We are bringing in all these different elements of human speech which are really important,” says Wairagkar. Previous BCIs could produce only flat, monotone speech.

“This is a bit of a paradigm shift in the sense that it can really lead to a real-life tool,” says Silvia Marchesotti, a neuroengineer at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. The system's features “would be crucial for adoption for daily use for the patients in the future.”

The imported mini-trucks are cute, but they're also quite serviceable—if you can use them on public roads.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story.

Oregon is one of many states vying to allow the limited use of Japanese Kei trucks on public roads. Following in the footsteps of Texas and Colorado, Oregon's new legislation (Senate Bill 1213) would allow the use of these cute little trucks on roads with sub-65 mph speed limits. Should the bill pass, Oregonians will be able to enjoy many of the practical benefits of Kei vehicles, and Oregon will become the 31st state to open most of its public roads to Kei trucks.

Kei trucks are dwarfed by even Ford's small Maverick pickup truck, and have unsurprisingly grown tremendously popular over the past couple of years. However, they aren't 50-state legal quite yet. 

Kei vehicles, also known as kei-jidōsha cars, were built to satisfy a Japanese automotive standard limiting footprint and engine displacement. Implemented in 1949, these regulations aimed to stimulate car ownership and the Japanese automotive industry. They were revised many times over, but generally establish that automobiles be no more than 11.2 feet long, 4.9 ft wide, 6.6 ft tall, and feature engines no bigger than 660 cc. Japanese automakers and lawmakers eventually settled on a “gentleman's agreement” to allow a maximum of 63 horsepower. 

Many in the United States are drawn to Kei trucks for their novelty, but these peculiar pickups are capable machines in their own right. Even with their microscopic size, the bed of the truck isn't considerably smaller than what you'd find on a modern mid-size pickup truck—for context, these trucks generally feature six-foot-long beds, which are comparable to those of just about any brand-new Toyota Tacoma, Ford Ranger, GMC Canyon, etc... Obviously, they can't manage the same payloads, but many of the Kei trucks feature folding bed sides (which we think are worth the cost of admission alone). 

Many states still disallow the use of Kei trucks on public roads. Pennsylvania—Popular Mechanics' home state—is no exception, and Kei trucks there still occupy a legal grey area. However, there are three pathways to register these vehicles.

Off-Road Title

Just as it says in the name, an off-road title allows the owner to operate their vehicle on private property. Driving on public roads isn't allowed with an off-road title. This type of title is a one-time fee, meaning that the vehicle isn't subject to an annual inspection.

Farm Exemption

Farm exemptions would allow Kei trucks to be used exclusively on farm land. The farm exemption differs from an off-road title in that it only gives you a two-year exemption—you'll need to get it renewed after it expires. Conveniently, the farm exemption also exempts you from the annual state inspection.

Antique Registration

Antique registration is currently the only way for Pennsylvanians to get their Kei trucks on the road for limited use. To qualify, the vehicle must be at least 25 years old, used for occasional transportation needs, and not used for commercial purposes or general daily transportation.

Once you have the legal green light, you'll need to figure out where on Earth to buy one of these things. Thankfully, this issue has been solved by online Kei “dealerships” that handle the import process and sometimes even assist with vehicle registration.

As a habitual Kei-vehicle window-shopper, I've found the best results using three websites: Cars From Japan, Northwest Mini Trucks, and Boeki. Even if you're not in the area, most of these spots will be able to ship the vehicle to you. Some businesses, including Boeki, will even let you test drive a vehicle before buying it. 

Research and common sense are two of the best tools you can have when buying a Kei truck—and any used vehicle, for that matter. But if you do decide to acquire one, hopefully you'll soon be able to take your delightfully undersized truck out on the open road.

Where do you go when you're a fish and you need a skincare treatment? Coral reefs contain natural "beauty salons," lively social hubs of activity where fish "clients" swim up and wait to be serviced by smaller fish cleaners. The little cleaners dart under and around their much bigger clients -- even entering their mouths -- cleaning their scales of bacteria and parasites like a team of car washers servicing a Buick. Sometimes cleaners even rub against their clients, providing a soothing massage.

But aside from skincare benefits, what role might busy cleaner fish stations play in spreading microbes and bacteria -- for good or ill -- throughout the reef?

A study published in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series is the first to investigate the influence of cleaner fish stations on reef microbial diversity. It is led by scientists from the University of California, Davis, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) in collaboration with the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science.

Could busy cleaning stations, like some medical clinics, be hotspots for spreading bacteria and pathogens? Conversely, could they help spread beneficial microbes among reef communities? Such questions carry important implications for protecting and restoring coral reefs.

"How pathogens or microbes are moving around a reef could be critically important to understanding how individuals will be affected," said lead author Anya Brown, an assistant professor with the UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory and a National Geographic Explorer who conducted the study while at WHOI. "We know microbes play a role in coral bleaching, for example. This study really lays a foundation for using cleaner fish stations as a way to study movement of microbes around the reef environment."

Cleaner fish and reef health

One hardworking fish is the cleaning goby, a pinky-sized fish with a boldly colored stripe running along its length. To understand how the presence of cleaner fish stations influence microbial diversity, the researchers experimentally removed cleaning gobies from cleaner stations on two Caribbean reefs in Puerto Rico and St. Croix in June 2021. They compared water nutrients and microbial communities of the surrounding reef area with and without gobies. This also included resident damselfish, frequent clients of cleaner gobies.

They found that more fish visited sites where cleaner fish were present compared to where they were removed in both Puerto Rico and St. Croix. They also found that cleaner fish do influence damselfish and reef microbial diversity, but the extent of their role depends on substrate type and the specific reef environment, as each reef carries a unique microbial signature. In the study, client fish, nutrient concentrations and water bacterial cell densities varied throughout the sites.

The authors say the results highlight yet another potential impact of cleaner fish and the need to further demystify their role in shaping reef microbial diversity and transmission.

Tiny fish can have big impact

"While larger organisms on coral reefs attract the most attention, the study underscores the huge impact tiny organisms such as these fish can have and how important they are to helping healthy reef ecosystems function," said coauthor Paul Sikkel, a research professor at the Rosenstiel School's Department of Marine Biology and Ecology. "While cleaner fish are well-known for their role in consuming parasites and reducing stress in other fish, this is the first field study to quantify their effects on microbes of other fish and the surrounding coral reef environment."

Additional coauthors include Amy Apprill and Jeanne Bloomberg of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), Gina Hendrick and Matthew Nicholson of the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, and Marta Soares and Raquel Xavier of the University of Porto in Portugal.

The study was funded by the National Science Foundation, WHOI, and The Foundation for Science and Technology in Portugal.

Metrics details

Sexual dysmorphism in the number and distribution of meiotic crossovers is seen across species but is poorly understood. Here, we disrupt multiple anti-crossover pathways in hermaphrodite Arabidopsis and analyze thousands of female and male progeny genomes. The greatest crossover increase is seen in zyp1 recq4 mutants, with a 12-fold rise in females and 4.5-fold in males. Additional manipulation of crossover regulators does not further increase crossovers but shifts the balance between crossover pathways, suggesting competition for a shared, limited precursor pool. While wild-type crossover patterns differ between sexes, mutant crossover landscapes converge on a unique distinct profile, which we term Crossover Potential (COP). COP can be accurately predicted using only sequence and chromatin features. We propose that COP reflects the density of eligible recombination precursors, which is determined by genomic features and is thus identical across sexes, with sexual dimorphism resulting solely from differential regulation of their maturation into crossovers.

In sexual reproduction, meiotic recombination generates reciprocal exchanges between homologous chromosomes called crossover (CO), enhancing genetic diversity1,2. Notably, in the context of plant breeding, COs introduce favorable gene combinations and break up unfavorable linkages, allowing breeders to improve crop varieties. However, COs are limited in number, with typically 1-3 per chromosome per meiosis3,4, despite a large excess of molecular precursors. CO formation is initiated by programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) which are repaired by using the homologous chromosome as a template. The number of early recombination intermediates is estimated to be 10-25 fold greater than the eventual number of COs in mammals and plants5,6,7,8,9. CO frequencies are not homogenous along chromosomes, creating a landscape of recombination with high peaks and large valleys. COs are also subjected to interference, in which one CO inhibits the formation of another nearby, effectively limiting the frequency of close double COs10,11,12,13. Intriguingly, CO frequency and distribution can differ markedly between females and males of the same species, a phenomenon called heterochiasmy14. The factors and mechanisms that shape CO distribution along the genome and differently in females and males are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear what is the relative contribution of precursor distribution versus a differential likelihood of precursor maturation to CO is in the final landscape.

In most eukaryotes, two molecular pathways contribute to the maturation of recombination intermediates into CO, defining two classes of COs. Class I COs are promoted by the ZMMs protein, are sensitive to interference, and account for the majority of COs; class II COs are ZMM-independent and promoted by nucleases, including MUS81. Class II is a minor pathway in most eukaryotes, including plants, and is not or much less sensitive to interference11,15.

A series of factors that limit either class I or class II COs are known in Arabidopsis. One is the dosage of the ZMM protein HEI10, whose overexpression (HEI10oe) almost doubles the number of class I COs16,17. Another key factor regulating class I CO is the central part of the synaptonemal complex (SC), including the transverse filament ZYP118,19,20. The SC forms a structure that connects the homologous chromosomes all their length during the meiotic prophase. Mutation of ZYP1 eliminates CO interference and heterochiasmy and increases class I CO numbers ~twice18,19, and has a cumulative effect with HEI10oe on the number of class I CO21. On the other hand, the RECQ4A and RECQ4B helicases (called here RECQ4 for simplicity) redundantly prevent the formation of class II CO3,22. The combination of recq4 mutation and HEI10oe showed an additive effect with an increase in both class I and class II COs16, suggesting that class I and class II CO can be manipulated independently. The AAA-ATPase protein FIGL1 also limits class II COs by regulating strand invasion23,24 with has a synergetic effect with recq4, reaching the largest increase of (class II) CO described to date3,23,25,26. Additional proteins, such as FLIP, SNI, TOP3/RMI1, HSBP, HCR1 and HCR3 have anti-CO roles in Arabidopsis, being partners or regulators of the functions described above25,27,28,29,30,31,32. Several combinations of anti-CO factors including higher-order ones, remained to be tested to explore the upper limit of crossover frequencies.

Here, we manipulated one, two, three, or four of these CO regulators in Arabidopsis and examined the CO frequency in thousands of progenies derived from female and male crosses. Notably, COs in zyp1 recq4 showed a 12-fold increase in females and a 4.5-fold increase in males, accompanied by only a slight reduction in fertility. Manipulating additional CO regulators in zyp1 recq4 did not further increase CO frequency but altered the ratio of class I and class II COs, suggesting an upper limit had been reached. The relative distributions of COs along the genome in various mutant combinations converge to a common profile in both females and males, which diverges markedly from the wild-type distribution. We termed this profile Crossover Potential (COP) and showed that it can be accurately predicted using a few sequence and chromatin features. We propose that COP reflects the density of recombination precursors, which is determined by genomic features and is identical in both sexes, with sexual dimorphism in crossover landscapes arising solely from differences in precursor maturation into COs.

We analyzed the number and distribution of COs in both female and male meiosis in wild-type, single and multi-mutants, by generating biallelic- Col/Ler F1 hybrids and reciprocally crossing them with wild-type Col (Fig. 1a, and Figure S1–S5). The obtained female and male-derived progenies (Back-cross BC1 populations) were analysed by whole genome Illumina sequencing to detect CO transmitted by female and male gametes, respectively (Fig. 1b, c). This method allows CO measurement with high accuracy, with some limitations. First, the CO position cannot be determined in regions lacking reliable markers (e.g., centromeric regions); but note that the presence/absence of CO in such areas can be reliably assessed by analyzing flanking markers. Second, with our stringent parameters, double-COs less than 90 kb apart, if they exist, and terminal CO less than 45 kb away from the telomere would be missed (see “methods”). In parallel, we counted the number of MLH1/HEI10 co-foci, which marks class I COs sites at diplotene/diakinesis33,34, in the Col/Ler F1 hybrids of each genotype. The MLH1/HEI10 focus counts were done in meiocytes both from ovules (female meiocytes) and anthers (male meiocytes) at the diplotene/diakinesis stage (Fig. 2a–m). At these stages, MLH1 and HEI10 foci almost perfectly co-localize (Table S1, supplementary data 2). Comparison of the number of MLH1/HEI10 foci (class I CO, counted the Col/Ler F1 hybrids) and genetic crossovers detected by sequencing (class I + class II COs, produced in the F1 hybrids and transmitted to the BC1 populations), allows the estimation of the contribution of each pathway (Fig. 2n). Note that the mean number of CO per gamete is expected to be half the number of cytological CO (or chiasma). This is because a chiasma affects only two of the four chromatids of a chromosome pair, and a gamete inherits a single chromatid35 (see Figure S11 in21). Thus, under the assumption that each MLH1 focus is converted into a CO and that all chiasma are marked by MLH1/HEI10, the frequency of genetic CO per gamete/BC1 is expected to be half of the frequency of MLH1/HEI10 foci per cell (1 focus=0.5 CO, indicated by a dashed line in Fig. 2n). If a proportion of chiasmata/CO is nor marked by MLH1/HEI10 (i.e., class II COs), the frequency of genetic CO per gamete is expected to be higher than half of the frequency of MLH1/HEI10 foci per cell (an upward deviation from the dashed line in Fig. 2n).

The number of analyzed cells correspond to the number of points in Fig. 2a. Scale bar=2 µm. n Comparison of the numbers of genetic COs (Fig 1a) and MLH1/HEI10 foci per cell (Fig. 2a) in females and males of various genotypes. The number of samples are identical to Figs. 1a and 2a. Females are shown by circle, and males are shown by triangle. Error bars are the 90% confidence intervals of the mean. The dashed line indicates the number of genetic COs expected to be observed under the hypotheses that each MLH1/HEI10 foci is converted into a CO and all COs are marked by MLH1/HEI10 (no class II COs).

In the wild type, we observed an average of 2.8 COs per female gamete, and 5.2 per male (p < 10−6 Mann-Whitney test), confirming the previously observed heterochiasmy36,37. The number of MLH1 foci matches 2-fold the number of genetic COs, suggesting that in both female and male wild-type, the vast majority of crossovers are class I COs (Fig. 2n). Class II COs were suggested to represent ~15% of all meiotic COs in Arabidopsis, based on the observation of residual chiasmata in the zmm mutants9. The almost perfect match between the number of foci and the number of genetic COs that we observed suggests a more minor contribution of the class II pathway in wild-type meiosis.

In single mutants, HEI10oe and zyp1, the average CO number per transmitted gamete was substantially increased compared with the wild type, consistent with previous results17,18. In HEI10oe, the CO number in females (6.2, 2.2-fold/wild type, p < 10−6) remains lower than in males (9.9, 1.9-fold/wild type, p < 10−6. Difference in fold increases female vs male, Mann-Whitney p = 0.001). In zyp1, the CO number is equal in female (7.1, 2.5-fold/wild type, p < 10−6) and male meiosis (7.0, 1.3-fold/wild type, p < 10−6. zyp1 female vs zyp1 male, p = 0.41. Differences in fold increase female vs male, p < 10−6). In both cases, MLH1/HEI10 foci were also increased in female and male meiocytes of the F1 (p < 10−4), matching the number of COs in their progenies (Fig. 2a, n). Thus, overexpressing HEI10 or mutating ZYP1 exclusively increases class I COs. However, while heterochiasmy and CO interference are still present in HEI10oe, both are abolished in zyp1 (Fig. 1b, Figure S6).

Single recq4 mutation increased COs to higher levels and, remarkably, inverted heterochiasmy, reaching 17.5 in females (6.3-fold/wild type, p < 10−6) and 14 in male gametes (4.5-fold/wild type, p < 10−6) (Fig. 1b)3. In contrast to HEI10oe and zyp1 in which MLH1/HEI10 foci are increased, the number of MLH1/HEI110 foci was unchanged in both female or male recq4 meiocytes compared to wild-type (p = 0.89 and p = 0.09) (Fig. 2), consistent with the role of RECQ4 in limiting specifically class II COs22. This is reflected in Fig. 2n, by a vertical deviation from the dashed line, with the number of genetic COs largely exceeding the expected number according to MLH1/HEI10 focus counts. Accordingly, as class II COs are not subjected to interference, CO interference is not detectable in recq4 (Figure S6). The absence of interference is also reflected by a higher variation in the number of COs per gamete in recq4 (and combinations, see below) than in the wild type (Fig. 2b). Thus, recq4 boosts class II CO, with a more prominent effect in female than male meiosis.

HEI10oe increases class I COs while recq4 increases class II COs. Combining recq4 HEI10oe, we observed an average of 23 COs in female and 17.2 in male gametes, higher than both single mutants (p < 10−6) (Fig. 1b). This is consistent with previous studies performed in F2 population16. Under the hypothesis of additive effects, simply summing the wild-type counts with the gains observed in each single mutant, we would have expected 20.9 COs in female gametes [2.8 + (6.2 − 2.8) + (17.5 − 2.8)] and 18.7 in male gametes [5.2 + (9.9 − 5.2) + (14.0 − 5.2)], which is similar to the observed values. In both female and male meiosis of F1s, the numbers of MLH1/HEI10 foci in recq4 HEI10oe are not modified compared to HEI10oe (p = 0.47 and p = 0.55) (Fig. 2a, n), suggesting that class I COs are unaffected by the recq4 mutation. Altogether, this shows that combining recq4 and HEI10oe leads to parallel increases of class I COs and class II COs provoked by respectively by HEI10oe and recq4 and thus to an additive effect on the total number of COs.

Next, we combined the two factors that individually increase class I COs, HEI10oe and zyp121. Following the same logic as above, the hypothesis of an additive effect predicts 11.7 COs in female (2.8 + 3.4 + 4.3) and 10.5 COs in male gametes (5.2 + 4.7 + 1.8). In zyp1 HEI10oe, we observed an average of 14.7 COs in male gametes, which is higher than single mutants (p < 10−6) and than the additive prediction, and 19.6 in females, which is almost twice the prediction. MLH1/HEI10 foci are largely increased in F1 female and male meiosis, reaching ~29.5 in both sexes, more than each single mutant and 3-4-fold the wild-type (Fig. 2a). This indicates that HEI10oe and zyp1 synergistically augment class I COs21. In male zyp1 HEI10oe meiocytes, the number of MLH1/HEI10 foci (29.3) matches the frequency of genetic COs (Figs. 1b, 2a, n), suggesting that all COs in male zyp1 HEI10oe are of class I COs. In contrast, in female zyp1 HEI10oe, the MLH1/HEI10 foci counts were 29.8, which corresponds to 14.9 COs per gamete, while 19.6 COs were observed (Figs. 1b, 2a, n). This suggests that in addition to the large boost in class I COs, class II COs are also increased in zyp1 HEI10oe female meiosis, leading to an inversion of heterochiasmy.

In the last combination of two factors, zyp1 recq4, the COs number per gamete was massively increased to 34.7 in females and 23.5 in males, almost twice the number measured in recq4, the highest single mutant (p < 10−6) (Fig. 1b). This is significantly higher than the predictions under an additive hypothesis, 21.8 in females [2.8 + (7.1 − 2.8) + (17.5-2.8)] and 15.8 in males [5.2 + (7.0 − 5.2) + (14 − 5.2)], indicating a synergetic effect. The high CO levels in zyp1 recq4 are unprecedented (compared to wild-type, 12.4-fold in females and 4.5-fold in males), being above all previously described mutants, including the champion to date recq4 figl1 (Fig. 1b−d)16,17,18,21,22,26. The variance of CO per gamete is also large, with the extreme case of a female gamete with 76 COs distributed among the five chromosomes, while the highest number observed in a wild-type female gamete is 6 COs (Fig. 1b, c). In zyp1 recq4, the number of MLH1/HEI10 foci (12.5 in females, 12.7 in males) are stable compared with zyp1 (12.3 in females, 12.7 in males) (Fig. 2a, n) and do not match the number of COs, suggesting that the vast majority of CO are class II COs (Fig. 2a, n). Mutating RECQ4 in the zyp1 mutant thus increases class II COs, like it does in wild-type, but with a much stronger effect (Fig. 2n). Altogether, we conclude that in zyp1 recq4 class I COs are increased similarly to the single zyp1 while class II COs are boosted by a synergistic effect of the two mutations, which is particularly marked in female meiosis. This also points to a role of ZYP1 in preventing class II COs, in addition to its described role in regulating class I COs.

The results described above show that all the combinations of two mutations among HEI10oe, zyp1, and recq4 have more COs than the single mutants, predicting that the triple mutant should have even more COs. However, the CO numbers in zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe did not increase significantly compared to zyp1 recq4, reaching 34.0 COs in females (p = 0.68) and 25.6 in males (p = 0.06), respectively (Fig. 1b), indicating that a certain upper limit might have been reached. Interestingly, the number of MLH1/HEI10 foci is increased when adding HEI10oe to zyp1 recq4 in both female and male meiocytes (p < 10−6), but not the total number of COs, suggesting that an increase in class I COs is compensated by a decrease in class II COs. This further supports the conclusion that an upper limit has been reached and that the two pathways compete for a large but limited number of CO precursors.

FIGL1 is another anti-class II CO factor that acts independently from RECQ43,26. Adding figl1 mutation to zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe is thus expected to increase COs further. However, the number of COs in zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1 mutant was not increased and instead was decreased compared to zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe (p < 10−6) (Fig. 1b, d). This further supports the idea of an upper limit in CO formation and shows that the figl1 mutation can increase or decrease COs depending on the context.

Heterochiasmy is defined as a different rate of meiotic recombination between the two sexes of the same species38. In wild-type Arabidopsis, the frequency of COs is higher in males (ratio female/male=0.54, p < 10−6), with a similar ratio in HEI10oe (0.63, p < 10−6). In zyp1, heterochiasmy is abolished with similar CO frequency in female and male gametes (p = 0.47) (Fig. 1b). Intriguingly, the heterochiasmy is inverted, with more COs in females than males in single recq4 (1.25, p = 0.00026) and all double and triple mutants studied here: zyp1 HEI10oe (1.33, p < 10−6), recq4 HEI10oe (1.34, p < 10−6), zyp1 recq4 (1.48, p < 10−6), zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe (1.33, p < 10−6), and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1 (1.32, p = 1.02 10−6) (Fig. 1b). This shows that while CO levels are higher in males than in females in wild-type, the potential for CO formation is higher in females.

In most eukaryotes, CO frequencies are limited to 1-3 per chromosome, leading to the idea that a higher frequency of COs could be detrimental, possibly disturbing chromosome segregation during meiotic divisions and fertility. We estimated the fertility by counting the number of seeds per fruit (silique). Different mutants showed varying degrees of reduction in fertility, but the fertility is poorly correlated with CO frequency (Fig. 1b, Fig. 3a). The fertility of recq4 was not significantly reduced compared to the wild type, despite a massive increase in COs (6.3-fold in females, 2.7-fold in males), consistent with previous results3,16 (Fisher's LSD test, p > 0.9999, Fig. 1b, Fig. 3a). In zyp1, fertility is modestly but significantly affected (p < 0.0001, Fig. 3a), probably because of the failure to ensure the obligate CO18,19. Strikingly, zyp1 recq4 showed a fertility similar to zyp1 (p = 0.9913, Fig. 3a, b), showing that the dramatic increase in COs is not associated with a further reduction in fertility. Despite a ~ 12-fold elevated CO frequency in female meiosis, the fertility of zyp1 recq4 is still ~75% of wild-type (Fig. 3a, b). Further, analyses based on genome coverage by sequencing did not detect any aneuploids in the progeny of zyp1 recq4 (n = 2 × 186) suggesting that chromosome missegregation at meiosis is absent or rare (Fig. 3c). However, chromosome spreads of male meiocytes revealed abnormal chromosome structures in ~16% of metaphase I cells, suggestive of abnormal recombination intermediates, which might cause reduced fertility in zyp1 recq4 (Fig. 3e, f, k, l, p).

a Quantification of fertility. Each dot represents the fertility of an individual plant, measured as the number of seeds per fruit averaged on ten fruits. The red bar shows the mean. All plants were grown in parallel, and the wild-type controls were siblings of the mutants. The number n of analyzed plants is indicated. Letters (a–c) above each data point group indicate statistically significant differences among genotypes, as determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test (p < 0.05). Genotypes sharing the same letter are not significantly different from one another. b Representative cleared fruits of wild type, zyp1 recq4, zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1 mutants in Col/Ler background. c The percentage of aneuploid samples detected in each population. The proportion of aneuploid samples in each population is shown on top of the bars. d–o DAPI-stained meiotic chromosome spreads from Col/Ler male meiocytes in wild type (d, j), zyp1 req4 (e, f, k, i) HEI10oe (g, m), zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe (h, n) and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1 (i, o). d–i Metaphase I. j–o Anaphase I. Scale bar = 10 µm. Red arrows pointed out abnormal chromosome connections, fragments and chromosome threads. p Quantification of different chromosome behaviors at metaphase I in wild type, zyp1 recq4, HEI10oe, zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1. Cells were categorized according to normal (5 bivalents) and abnormal chromosome behavior (fragmentation, univalent and chromosome connection). The number of analyzed cells is indicated above the bar.

HEI10oe showed a significant fertility reduction (p < 0.0001, Fig. 3a), consistent with previous studies16, possibly due to a chromosomal rearrangement associated with the transgene in the HEI10oe C2 line17, which is heterozygous in the hybrid context. Consistently chromosome connections were observed in 34% of HEI10oe meiotic cells (Fig. 3g, m, p). Aneuploids were also detected in the progeny of all genotypes with HEI10oe (Fig. 3c) whereas no aneuploids were detected in recq4 and zyp1 recq4 progenies (Fig. 3c). Fertility of zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1 was not reduced compared with zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe (p = 0.9961, Fig. 3a, b), suggesting that plants can still maintain a certain level of fertility even with disturbed strand-invasion and high recombination.

As shown above, mutating ZYP1 in certain contexts (recq4, female HEI10oe) provokes an increase in COs but not MLH1/HEI10 foci, suggesting an anti-class II CO function for ZYP1, in addition to its established role in regulating class I COs. Mutating the nuclease MUS81 in anti-class II factors in Arabidopsis provoked meiotic catastrophe22,23,39,40, presumably because DNA joint molecules remain unrepaired. Similarly, we observed some chromosome fragments in 40% of anaphase I meiotic cells in zyp1 mus81 (Figure S8). In addition, fertility in zyp1 mus81 was reduced by 25% compared to wild type or mus81 (Figure S8j). This suggests that ZYP1 prevents the formation of joint molecules that need MUS81 to be repaired. However, this role is likely minor or redundant as no increase of class II COs is observed in the single zyp1 mutant (Fig. 2n)18.

Next, we examine the distribution of COs along the chromosomes to test whether or not the increase observed in the different mutants is homogeneous (Fig. 4). In all the mutant combinations with large CO increases, COs tend to accumulate in distal regions in both females and males. It is especially striking when looking at the highest recombining genotypes zyp1 recq4 and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe (Fig. 4a, b). The same is observed when merging the female and male data (pseudo-F2), and in the previously analyzed recq4 figl1 F2 populations (Fig. 4c)26. Intriguingly, the crossover landscapes in the different hyper-recombining mutants were highly consistent with each other, with common peaks and valleys (see also below). Looking at the local fold increase compared to the wild type (Figure S9), we detected common hotspots of CO increase in mutants, some above 200-fold in zyp1 recq4 and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe, notably in distal regions in females where CO frequency is low in wild-type and high in the mutants. In contrast, regions in the periphery of the centromeres where CO frequencies are relatively high in wild-type meiosis, correspond to recalcitrant zones with no or limited increase in the mutants.

a, b The distribution (sliding window-based, window size 1 Mb, step size 50 kb) of COs along chromosomes in female (a) and male (b) of wild type, HEI10oe, zyp1, recq4, zyp1 HEI10oe, recq4 HEI10oe, zyp1 recq4, zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1. c The distribution (sliding window-based, window size 1 Mb, step size 50 kb) of COs along chromosomes in F2 or pseudo F2 of wild type, HEI10oe, zyp1, recq4, zyp1 HEI10oe, recq4 HEI10oe, recq4 figl1, zyp1 recq4, zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1. d The zoom of the CO position in the centromere proximal regions (Non-Recombining Zones, NRZs). Each point is a CO, circles, triangles and squares are females, males and F2s, respectively. The vertical dashed lines in red indicates the position of marker COs of NRZs, lines in black shows the middle position of centromeres.

Zooming on closer centromere-proximal region, we examined the Non-Recombining Zones (NRZs) previously defined as the interval spanning the centromere with a complete absence of CO in the wild type, as scored in 3,613 gametes containing a total of 14,397 COs41 (Fig. 4d). Strikingly, with such an unprecedented increase in CO numbers in the mutants described here, the NRZs persisted in resisting recombination and barely had any CO, despite our dataset containing a total of 70,022 COs. No COs were detected in NRZs in zyp1 recq4 (10,825 COs), and only one CO was found in each population of recq4 (3,675 COs), recq4 figl1 (15,543 COs), and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe (10,991 COs) (Fig. 4d). This strongly suggests that other mechanisms, that do not depend on HEI10, ZYP1, RECQ4 or FIGL1, prevent CO formation in the NRZs.

Crossover landscapes in various mutants appear to have similar landscapes (Figs. 4, 5). To explore this formally, and compare the shape of the distributions independently of the absolute frequencies, we normalized the data by calculating the distribution of relative frequency per chromosome (i.e., what proportion of COs that occurred in this chromosome occurred in a given interval) (Fig. 5 and Figure S10–12). In wild-type females, the density of COs was the highest in the periphery of centromeres, and low at chromosome ends (Fig. 5a). In the wild-type males, COs are also frequent in the periphery of centromeres, but chromosome ends are also CO-rich (Fig. 5b). Consequently, female and male distributions are poorly correlated in the wild type (Spearman's correlation r = 0.45, Fig. 5h). Both female and male zyp1 recq4 distributions differ markedly from the wild-type distributions (R = −0.14 and R = 0.36, Fig. 5a–b, d, f), but are strikingly similar to each other (r = 0.93, Fig. 5a, b, i). Further, the CO distributions in various mutants were similar to each other, but distinct from the wild-type, in both females (e.g., r = 0.86, zyp1 HEI10oe vs zyp1 recq4; Fig. 5a, d–e, Figure S10) and males (e.g., r = 0.88, recq4 HEI10oe vs zyp1 recq4; Fig. 5b, f, g, Figure S11). The CO landscape in the F2 populations of recq4 figl1 and zyp1 recq4 are also strikingly consistent (r = 0.97, recq4 figl1 vs zyp1 recq4; r = 0.97, zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe vs zyp1 recq4; Fig. 5c, j, k, and Figure S12)26. CO landscapes in recq4, zyp1 HEI10oe, recq4 HE10oe, recq4 figl1, zyp1 recq4, zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe are all very similar, with correlations in the range 0.75–0.92 (Figure S12).

a, b The distribution (scaled per chromosome, sliding window-based, window size 1 Mb, step size 50 kb) of relative CO frequency along chromosomes in female (a) and male (b) of wild type, recq4, zyp1 HEI10oe, recq4 HEI10oe, zyp1 recq4 and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe. c The distribution (scaled per chromosome, sliding window-based, window size 1 Mb, step size 50 kb) of COs along chromosomes in F2 or pseudo F2 of wild type, recq4, zyp1 HEI10oe, recq4 HEI10oe, recq4 figl1, zyp1 recq4 and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe. d–k Spearman's correlation tests of relative CO frequencies (each point in an interval, as defined as Fig. 5a–c) comparing between genotypes and sexes. The blue line was added by using “lm” method, with 0.95 confidence intervals marked by gray shading.

The convergence towards a similar pattern in females and males in different mutants suggests the existence of a common underlying feature. We propose that this distribution of Crossover Potential (COP) represents the distribution of eligible recombination intermediates (i.e., DSBs that are being repaired with the homologous chromosomes, potentially leading to a CO). We then combined the 21,104 female and 15,188 male COs from the various mutant combinations (recq4, zyp1 HEI10oe, recq4 HEI10oe, zyp1 recq4, zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe, and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1) to create high-resolution maps of COP in females and males, separately (Fig. 6a). The female and male COP maps are strikingly similar, the female curve being slightly above the male one. When normalized, the two COP curves almost perfectly overlap (Fig. 6b, Spearman's correlation r = 0.91), showing that the distribution of COP is shared between the two sexes. These features of COP strikingly deviate from those of wild-type COs, which are more frequent in males than females and very differently distributed. We then combined the female and male COs of the mutants listed above, together with the recq4 figl1 F2 population, totaling 49,482 COs, and generated a high-resolution universal COP map (Fig. 6c). The COP is not homogenous along chromosomes with null values in the centromeric regions and globally higher frequencies toward chromosome ends, and sharp peaks and valleys.

a The distribution (sliding window-based, window size 300 kb, step size 50 kb) of CO frequency along chromosomes in females and males, respectively, by merging recq4, zyp1 HEI10oe, recq4 HEI10oe, zyp1 recq4, zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1. b The distribution (scaled per genome, sliding window-based, window size 300 kb, step size 50 kb) of relative precursor frequency along chromosomes in females and males, respectively, by merging recq4, zyp1 HEI10oe, recq4 HEI10oe, zyp1 recq4, zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1. c The distribution (scaled per genome, sliding window-based, window size 100 kb and 300 kb, step size 50 kb) of relative precursor frequency along chromosomes in F2s, by merging females and males of recq4, zyp1 HEI10oe, recq4 HEI10oe, zyp1 recq4, zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe and zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1, and F2s of recq4 figl1. The vertical dashed lines in black shows the middle position of centromeres. d Spearman's correlation test shows the comparison with features along chromosomes, with differences in color and length according to the correlation scale. SNPs (SNPs density between Col and Ler), INV_TRANS (inversions and translocations between Col and Ler), Synteny (collinearity between Col and Ler), Genes, TEs and GC (expressed gene in meiocytes, TE and GC density), ATAC and DNase (chromatin accessibility, ATAC-seq and DNase-seq, log2(Tn5/gDNA) and log2(DNase/gDNA), in floral tissues), H3K4me1/2/3, H3K9me2, H3K27me1 (euchromatin, heterochromatin, and Polycomb histone marks, ChIP-seq, log2(ChIP/input), in flower buds), mCG, mCHG and mCHH (DNA methylation in CG, CHG, and CHH contexts, proportion methylated cytosine, in male meiocytes), MNase (nucleosome occupancy, MNase-seq, log2(MNase/gDNA), in buds). e The cumulated proportion of variation that can be explained with the features at the genome scale. The top seven most important features are colored, for which the cumulative proportion of variation that can be explained reaches the plateau. f The chromosomal distribution of observed and predicted precursor maps. The precursor profiles of individual chromosomes were predicted using profiles of the top seven most important features from the other three chromosomes. g The Spearman's correlation test between the predicted and observed precursor distributions. The training-testing dataset is differentiated in shapes.

We next wondered what could shape the COP landscape. We performed correlation analysis with 17 different genomic features (Fig. 6d), including GC content, meiotically expressed genes42, transposable elements, sequence divergence between the two parental lines, chromatin accessibility, euchromatic and heterochromatic histone modification marks, DNA methylation, and nucleosome occupancy36. The distribution of COP is strongly positively correlated with euchromatic histone modification markers (H3K4me3, r = 0.85), density of expressed genes in meiocytes (r = 0.84), open chromatin (DNase, r = 0.75), and synteny (r = 0.78). Oppositely, significant negative correlations were found with DNA methylation (mCHG, r = −0.88), heterochromatic histone modification marks (H3K9me2, r = −0.86), density of TEs (r = −0.85) and inversions and translocations (r = −0.61). This result suggests that COP is favored by certain open chromatin states and disfavored by sequence divergence.

We then employed a machine-learning algorithm (random forest) to measure the capacity of the 17 features to predict the COP landscape. Overall, 94% of the genome-wide variation can be explained by a model developed with all 17 features (Fig. 6e). Among the 17 features, SNP density was assessed as the most predictive, which alone explained 6.4% of the genome-wide variation (Fig. 6e) and 28.4% of the variation along chromosome arms (Figure S13b). By adding features step by step in the order of importance, we found that the top seven and eight features can explain 93% of the genome-wide variation and 90.6% of the variation along chromosome arms, respectively (Fig. 6d, Figure S13b). To explore the predictive performance in the COP landscape of the model, we next performed 4 times cross-validation by using three chromosomes as the training dataset and one chromosome as the testing dataset (Fig. 6f, g, Figure S13c, d). Considering the top seven and eight features for genome-wide and chromosome arms, the model trained from the training dataset worked well with the testing dataset, resulting in a strong correlation (r = 0.9, Fig. 6f, g, and r = 0.86, Figure S11c, d) between the prediction and observation. The capacity of these features to accurately predict the landscape suggests that the COP might be entirely determined by (epi)genomic characteristics, including chromatin state and sequence divergence.

Meiotic crossover frequencies are naturally limited to a few per chromosome. Here, we have shown an unprecedented elevation of meiotic crossovers in Arabidopsis by simultaneously mutating the synaptonemal complex ZYP1 and the anti-recombination helicase RECQ4. We observed an average of 34.7 and 23.5 COs per female and male zyp1 recq4 gametes, respectively. This corresponds to 58 COs per generation in zyp1 recq4, to be compared with 8.1 in wild-type and 50 in the previous champion recq4 figl13,26. The fertility is only moderately affected in zyp1 recq4 and no genomic instability was observed, opening a possibility to manipulate recombination for the benefit of plant breeding. Higher CO levels could be leveraged to enhance genetic mixing of genetic information in the early steps of breeding, reduce the size of introgression to elite lines, and facilitate the identification of genetic determinants of traits26. The mutation of RECQ4 increases CO numbers in rice, tomato, and pea43,44, suggesting that manipulation of this factor can be useful in a wide variety of crops. However, it should be noted that the mutation of some anti-crossover factors, such as FIGL1, can have little effect on fertility in Arabidopsis and a much more dramatic effect in crop species44. Similarly, the recq4 mutation does not reduce fertility in Arabidopsis, rice, and tomato but does affect fertility in peas and wheat, which may limit its usefulness44,45. Mutation of ZYP1 in rice also increased class I CO number, but a ZYP1 RNAi reduced them in Barley46,47, calling for testing the effects of zyp1, and zyp1 recq4 in more species.

Mutating both ZYP1 and RECQ4 provoked a remarkable elevation in CO numbers, beyond what was expected under the hypothesis of simple additive effects of both mutations on class I and class II COs, respectively. These massive increases correspond to class II COs, as indicated by MLH1/HEI10 not marking extra COs. This points to a function of ZYP1 in preventing class II COs, which is revealed only when RECQ4 is absent, in addition to its documented function in regulating class I COs18,19. It suggests that recombination precursors (DNA double-strand breaks) could be increased in the absence of ZYP1, as shown when the homologous protein Zip1 is defective in yeast48,49. If the same scenario happens in zyp1 recq4, the additional DSBs would produce additional recombination intermediates, that would be repaired as non-crossover in the presence of RECQ4, but converted into class II COs in its absence. Another non-exclusive possibility is a role of the synaptonemal complex in preventing the formation of aberrant recombination intermediates (e.g., Multiple invasions from a single DSB). This is supported by the slight chromosome fragmentation observed in zyp1 mus81, pointing to the role of the nuclease MUS81 in repairing recombination intermediates in the absence of ZYP1. The more extensive fragmentation observed in rice zyp1 mus8150 suggests that this function could be more prominent in this species. Finally, one may speculate a role of ZYP1 in channeling the repair of a proportion of DSBs to the sister chromatid, leading to an increase of inter-homolog intermediate in zyp1 that would synergize with the anti-CO effect of RECQ4.

Combining HEI10oe, zyp1 or recq4 two by two systematically increased CO beyond the level of the single mutants. This predicted that combining the three should increase even further CO frequencies. However, adding HEI10oe to zyp1 recq4, the double mutant with the strongest effect, did not further increase COs. Interestingly, HEI10oe did increase the number of MLH1/HEI10 foci in both sexes in zyp1 recq4, without changing the total number of COs. This suggests that overexpressing HEI10 does, as expected, increase the number of class I COs, but that this is at the expense of class II COs. This suggests that a maximum number of COs has been reached and that at these high levels, the class I and class II pathways compete for a limited number of precursors. Intriguingly, while figl1 can enhance CO frequencies in recq43,26, adding the figl1 mutation to zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe does not increase COs, but decreases the CO frequency. We suspect that in this context, aberrant recombination molecules are formed, limiting their possibility to be matured into COs. In any case, it appears that the CO frequency observed in zyp1 recq4 corresponds to some kind of maximum. This maximum corresponds to ~70 chiasmata/COs per female meiocyte (average of 35 COs per gamete) and ~48 chiasmata/COs per male meiocyte (average of 24 COs per gamete). It is possible that this does not correspond to an absolute maximum, and playing with additional factors, for example, related to chromatin state or mismatch detection, may further enhance CO frequencies51,52. Based on DMC1/RAD51 foci, it is estimated that ~200 DSBs are produced per male meiocyte53. If we consider that 1/3 are repaired on the sister (absence of bias, one sister chromatid and two homologous chromatids)54, and that the class II pathway is not biased in the repair of CO precursors (1:1 CO/NCO), we would expect ~66 COs, to compare with the estimated ~48 chiasmata in zyp1 recq4 males. If all the considerations are correct, this suggests that additional mechanisms prevent DSB maturation into COs. Intriguingly, we observed an inversion of heterochiasmy in all mutants in which class II COs are deregulated (all the genotypes with the recq4 mutation, and female zyp1 HE10oe), with more COs in females than in males. One parsimonious hypothesis is that in all contexts, including wild-type, more DSBs are formed in females than males making female meiosis in mutants more prone to class II COs, but that the CO designation process in wild-type which is linked to the length of the SC and impassive to DSB counts would lead to fewer COs in females than males.

Strikingly, in female and male meiosis of various mutants, the CO distribution converged to a common profile, leading us to propose the concept of Crossover Potential (COP), whose density map is revealed when the CO designation process is deregulated. In this view, the COP determines where COs might occur, combining the local capacity to experience DNA double-strand breaks and the availability of a viable repair template on the homologous chromosome. Accordingly, open chromatin markers (positively correlated) and sequence divergences (negatively correlated) can together efficiently predict COP. It would be interesting to establish the COP in other species with different (epi)genomic characteristics compared to Arabidopsis (e.g., higher transposon or polymorphism density) and to test if similar features can predict it. COP would be responsible for the local placement of COs in genes observed in many species55,56,57,58,59. Note that PRDM9, which drives DSB positions in many mammals, dramatically affects COP distribution60. Importantly, COP very partially dictates the final CO distribution because of the CO designation process61,62 that determines the fate of eligible recombination intermediates. A striking example is the sexual dimorphism in the hermaphrodite Arabidopsis, where female and male CO landscapes markedly differ despite an identical genome and COP map. The limited influence of COP on the global CO distribution explains why the megabase-scale CO landscape is largely independent of sequence divergence36. While COP appears to be determined at the (epi)genomic level (chromatin state and sequence divergence), the CO designation process is a chromosomal event influenced by the higher-order spatial organization in the synaptonemal complex21,63,64,65. The CO distribution is thus determined by the combination of the COP, which is particularly important at the local scale and can dismiss some regions, and the designation process that shapes the global chromosomal landscape and dictates CO counts and heterochiasmy.

Arabidopsis thaliana plants were cultivated in Polyklima growth chambers (16-h day, 21.5 °C, 280 µM; 8-h night, 18 °C: 60% humidity). The following Arabidopsis lines were used in this study: Wild type Col-0(186AV1B4) and Ler − 1 (213AV1B1) from the Versailles stock center (http://publiclines.versailles.inra.fr/). This study used zyp1-1 in Col and zyp1-6 in Ler18, recq4a in Col (recq4a-4, N419423)66, recq4a-W387X in Ler22, recq4b in Col (recq4b-2, N511330)66, figl1-19 in Col (SALK_089653), figl1-12 in Ler23 and mus81-2 in Col67. The HEI10 over-expression line is Col HEI10 line C217. Genotyping of the mutants was carried out by PCR amplification (Supplementary Table 2).

The combinations of different mutants (Col/Ler hybrids) were obtained by a series of crossing schemes (Table S2 and Figs. S1–4). zyp1 HEI10oe was produced previously21. These eight different mutants and their sister wild-type control plants were backcrossed with Col plants as males and females to get the BC1 populations for sequencing and subsequent CO analysis. BC1 plant populations were grown for three weeks (16-h day/ 8-h night) and four days in the dark. 100–150 mg leaf samples from individual plantlets were collected from the BC1 populations68. Each plantlet was used as an individual sample for DNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing. The complete list of samples is provided in the Source data file of Fig. 1.

In this study, the female and male population of wild type (95 and 89 plants), HEI10oe (48 and 46 plants), zyp1 (42 males), recq4 HEI10oe (142 and 139 plants), zyp1 recq4 (186 and 186 plants), zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe (190 and 177 plants), zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1 (138 and 134 plants), were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq3000 (2 × 150 bp) conducted by the Max Planck-Genome-center (https://mpgc.mpipz.mpg.de/home/). The raw sequencing data of the female and male population of wild type (428 and 294 plants, ArrayExpress number: E-MTAB-1125436), HEI10oe (144 and 141 plants, ArrayExpress number: E-MTAB-1169621 and zyp1 (272 and 225 plants, ArrayExpress number: E-MTAB-959318, E-MTAB-1169621) from previous studies were also included in this study. In total, we analyzed female and male populations of 523 and 383 wild type, 192 and 187 HEI10oe, 272 and 267 zyp1, 142 and 138 recq4, 117 and 116 zyp1 HEI10oe, 142 and 139 recq4 HEI10oe, 186 and 186 zyp1 recq4, 190 and 177 zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe, 138 and 134 zyp1 recq4 HEI10oe figl1 plants. The number of COs, sequencing depth and source of each individual sample is provided in the Source data file of Fig. 1.

The raw sequencing data were quality-controlled using FastQC v0.11.9 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The sequencing reads were aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 TAIR10 reference genome69,70, using BWA v0.7.15-r114071, with default parameters. A set of Sambamba v0.6.872 commands was used for sorting and removing duplicated mapped reads. The creation of the high-confidence SNP marker list between Col and Ler, meiotic CO detection (a sliding window-based method, with a window size of 30 kb and a step size of 15 kb), A double-CO must be supported by at least five windows (total of 90 kb), and a terminal CO by at least two windows (45 kb). Check and filtering of low covered and potential contaminated samples were performed according to previous protocols18,21,36,73,74. Samples of each population were randomly selected to check predicted COs manually by inGAP-family v1.074.

The Coefficient of Coincidence (CoC) was calculated using MADpattern v1.164,75, with 10 intervals. The chromosome 4 was excluded from interference analyses because of a translocation associated with the HEI10 transgene16 and potential inversion in our Ler line18.

For CO distribution analysis, we refined the position of the marker COs of each NRZ boundary against the Col-TAIR10 reference genome used in this study. In addition, it should be noted that a translocation associated with the HEI10 C2 transgene at the short arm and a megabase-scale inversion at the long arm of chromosome 4, which may introduce bias of the CO distribution and thus chromosome 4 was excluded16.

To define hot and cold zones of CO burst from hyper recombination mutants, we examined COs in 1-Mb windows with 50-kb sliding and defined (i) the hot zones as common regions in zyp1 HEI10oe and at least 3 other mutants, with at least a two-fold increase than the median compared with wild-type, and (ii) the cold zones as common regions in zyp1 HEI10oe and at least 3 other mutants, with at most a half-fold increase than the median compared with wild-type.

For the genome-wide CO potential profile analysis by machine-learning algorithm, the chromosomal profiles of CO potential, genomic and epigenomic features were estimated in 300-kb windows with 50-kb steps along chromosomes. Then, all the random forest models were trained using randomForest v4.6-14 package in R, with the setting of “mtry=3, importance=TRUE, na.action=na.omit, ntree=2000”.

The genome was first cut into non-overlapping 100 kb windows, whose sequencing depth was estimated by Mosdepth v0.2.776 with parameters of “-n –fast-mode –by 100000”. Then, pairwise testing of sequencing depths between chromosomes of individuals was performed using the Mann–Whitney test, and the p values were adjusted using the fdr method. A pair of tested chromosomes with fold change > 1.2 and p value < 1e − 20 was considered aneuploid.

The RNA-seq dataset of Arabidopsis thaliana meiocytes from a previous study42 was downloaded from the NCBI SRA database (SRR5209212 and SRR5209213). First, quality checking of the raw sequencing reads was performed by using FastQC. Then, HISAT2 v2.1.077 was used to align the reads against the Col-0 TAIR10 reference genome. Gene expression was normalized as TPM, which was calculated by StringTie v2.0.678 with default parameters.

Meiotic chromosome spreads were performed as previously described79. Chromosomes were stained with DAPI (2 μg/ml). Slides were observed using a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 microscope. Images were acquired under a 100 × oil immersion objective, and processed with ZEN software. Immunolocalization performed on meiocytes with preserved three-dimensional structures was performed from 0.8–1.2 mm pistils (female meiocytes embedded in ovules) and anthers from 0.35–0.45 mm flower buds (male meiocytes), respectively18,21. Three primary antibodies were used for MLH1 foci number counting: anti-REC8 raised in rat80 (laboratory code PAK036, dilution 1:250), anti-MLH1 raised in rabbit81 (PAK017, 1:200), and anti-HEI10 raised in chicken82 (PAK046, 1:5000). Secondary antibodies (dilution 1:250) were Abberior STAR ORANGE Goat anti-rat IgG (STORANGE-1007), STAR RED Goat anti-chicken IgY (STRED-1005) and STAR GREEN Goat anti-rabbit IgG (STGREEN-1002).Images were acquired under Laica THUNDER Imager system and Abberior instrument facility line (https://abberior-instruments.com/). For Leica THUNDER Imager system, 555-nm, 635-nm and 475-nm excitation lasers were used for STAR Orange, STAR Red and STAR GREEN, respectively. Images were deconvoluted using Large Volume Computational Clearing (LVCC) mode in a Laica LAS X 5.1.0 software. For Abberior instrument facility line, images were acquired with 561- and 640-nm excitation lasers (for STAR Orange and STAR Red, respectively) and a 775-nm STED depletion laser. Confocal images were taken with the same instrument with a 485-nm excitation laser (for STAR GREEN/ Alexa488). Images were deconvoluted by Huygens Essential (version 21.10, Scientifific Volume Imaging, https://svi.nl/). Deconvoluted pictures were imported to Imaris x64 9.6.0 (https://imaris.oxinst.com/, Oxford Instruments, UK) for foci counting. The Spots module was used for MLH1 foci counting in diplotene and diakinesis cells. The vast majority of MLH foci colocalize with HEI10 foci (Table S1). Only double MLH1/HEI10 foci present on chromosomes were taken into account.

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were randomized by genetic segregation of mutant and wild-type alleles in plant populations. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Metrics details

Importing renewable energy to Europe may offer many potential benefits, including reduced energy costs, lower pressure on infrastructure development, and less land use within Europe. However, open questions remain: on the achievable cost reductions, how much should be imported, whether the energy vector should be electricity, hydrogen, or derivatives like ammonia or steel, and their impact on Europe's infrastructure needs. This study integrates a global energy supply chain model with a European energy system model to explore net-zero emission scenarios with varying import volumes, costs, and vectors. We find system cost reductions of 1-10%, within import cost variations of  ± 20%, with diminishing returns for larger import volumes and a preference for methanol, steel and hydrogen imports. Keeping some domestic power-to-X production is beneficial for integrating variable renewables, leveraging local carbon sources and power-to-X waste heat. Our findings highlight the need for coordinating import strategies with infrastructure policy and reveal maneuvering space for incorporating non-cost decision factors.

Importing renewable energy to Europe may offer several advantages for achieving a swift energy transition. It might lower costs, help circumvent the slow domestic deployment of renewable energy infrastructure and reduce pressure on land usage in Europe. Many parts of the world have cheap and abundant renewable energy supply potentials that they could offer to existing or emerging global energy markets1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Partnering with these regions could help Europe reach its carbon neutrality goals while stimulating economic development in exporting regions.

However, even if energy imports are economically attractive for Europe, a strong reliance may not be desirable because of energy security concerns. Awareness of energy security has risen since Russia constrained fossil gas supplies to Europe in 20229, at a time when the 27 member states of the European Union (EU27) imported around two-thirds of their fossil energy needs10. Europe must take care to avoid repeating the mistakes of previous decades when it became dependent on a small number of exporters with market power and reliant on rigid pipeline infrastructure.

Europe's strategy for clean energy imports will also strongly affect the requirements for domestic energy infrastructure. Previous research found many ways to develop a self-sufficient energy system11,12,13. To support such scenarios without energy imports into Europe, reinforcing the European power grid or building a hydrogen network was often identified as beneficial14,15. However, depending on the volumes and vectors of imports (electricity, hydrogen, or hydrogen derivatives) and levels of industry migration, Europe might not need to expand its hydrogen pipeline infrastructure. Most hydrogen is used to make derivative products (e.g., ammonia for fertilisers, sponge iron for steel, or Fischer-Tropsch fuels for aviation and shipping)14. If Europe imported these products at scale, much of the hydrogen demand would fall away. In consequence, this would reduce the need for hydrogen transport. However, if hydrogen itself were imported and to be transported to today's industry clusters, this would require a pipeline topology tailored to connecting these to the hydrogen arriving from North Africa or maritime entry points across Europe.

Policy has reflected these different visions for imports in various ways. In particular, hydrogen imports have recently attracted considerable interest, with plans of the European Commission16 to import 10 Mt (333 TWh, lower heating value) hydrogen and derivatives by 2030. New financing instruments, like the European Hydrogen Bank17 or H2Global18 are set up to support the scale-up of green hydrogen imports. The desire to import hydrogen and derivative products is also present in various national strategies19. In particular, Germany's new import strategy plans to cover up to 70% of its demand for hydrogen and its derivatives through imports by 2030 and highlights bilateral partnerships as well as the expansion of import infrastructure as a means to accomplish this20,21. Conversely, hydrogen roadmaps of Denmark22, Ireland23, Spain24, and the United Kingdom (UK)25, recognise these countries' potential to become major exporters of renewable energy, whereas France's strategy focuses on local hydrogen production to meet domestic needs26. Beyond direct energy imports, the Draghi report27 also raises broader concerns about European industrial competitiveness and discusses the benefits of relocating energy-intensive industries to renewable-rich regions inside Europe. In addition, European grid development plans28 reveal renewed enthusiasm for electricity imports via ultra-long high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cables, evolving from early DESERTEC29 ideas to contemporary proposals like the Morocco-UK Xlinks project30.

While many previous academic studies have evaluated the cost of ‘green' renewable energy and energy-intensive material imports in the form of electricity5,31,32,33,34,35 hydrogen2,6,36,37,38,39,40,41,42, ammonia7,43,44,45, methane2,46,47, steel48,49,50, carbon-based fuels4,51,52, or a broader variety of power-to-X fuels1,3,8,53,54,55,56, these do not address the interactions of imports with European energy infrastructure requirements. On the other hand, among studies dealing with the detailed planning of net-zero energy systems in Europe, some do not consider energy imports11,13,15, while others only consider hydrogen imports or a limited set of alternative endogenously optimised import vectors14,57,58,59,60,61. Only a few consider at least elementary cost uncertainties42,62, and none investigate a larger range of potential import volumes across subsets of available import vectors.

In this study, we explore the full range between the two poles of complete self-sufficiency and wide-ranging renewable energy imports into Europe in scenarios with high shares of wind and solar electricity and net-zero carbon emissions. We investigate how the infrastructure requirements of a self-sufficient European energy system that exclusively leverages domestic resources from the continent may differ from a system that relies on energy imports from outside of Europe. For our analysis, we integrate an open optimisation model of global energy supply chains, TRACE54, with a spatially and temporally resolved sector-coupled open-source energy system optimisation model for Europe, PyPSA-Eur63, to investigate the impact of imports on European energy infrastructure needs. We evaluate potential import locations and costs for different supply vectors, by how much system costs can be reduced through imports, and how their inclusion affects deployed transport networks, storage and backup capacities. For this purpose, we perform sensitivity analyses interpolating between very high levels of imports and no imports at all, exploring low and high costs for imports to account for associated uncertainties, and system responses to the exclusion of subsets of import vectors, in order to identify the cost-effective manoeuvreing space.

As possible import options, we consider electricity by transmission line, hydrogen as gas by pipeline and liquid by ship, methane as liquid by ship, liquid ammonia, crude steel and its precursor, hot briquetted iron (HBI), methanol and Fischer-Tropsch fuels by ship. Each energy vector has unique characteristics with regard to its production, storage, transport and consumption. Electricity offers the most flexible usage but is challenging to store and requires variability management if sourced from wind or solar energy. Hydrogen is easier to store and transport in large quantities, but at the expense of conversion losses and less versatile applications. Large quantities could be used for backup power and heat, steel production, industry feedstocks and the domestic synthesis of shipping and aviation fuels. On the other hand, imported synthetic carbonaceous fuels like methane, methanol and Fischer-Tropsch fuels could largely substitute the need for domestic synthesis. There is more experience with storing and transporting these fuels, and part of the existing infrastructure could potentially be reused or repurposed. However, they require a sustainable carbon source and, particularly for methane, effective carbon management and leakage prevention64. Ammonia is similarly easier to handle than hydrogen, but does not require a carbon source. However, it faces safety and acceptance concerns due to its toxicity and potentially adverse effects on the global nitrogen cycle65,66. Its demand in Europe is mostly driven by fertiliser usage. Crude steel and HBI represent the import of energy-intensive materials and offer low long-distance transport costs.

The PyPSA-Eur63 model co-optimises the investment and operation of generation, storage, conversion and transmission infrastructures in a single linear optimisation problem. The model is further given the opportunity to relocate ammonia and primary crude steel production within Europe, capturing potential renewables pull effects within Europe and abroad67,68,69. We resolve 115 regions comprising the European Union without Cyprus and Malta, as well as the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Kosovo. In combination with a 4-hourly-equivalent time resolution for the weather year of 2013, grid bottlenecks, renewable variability, and seasonal storage requirements are sufficiently captured. The model includes regional demands from the electricity, industry, buildings, agriculture and transport sectors, international shipping and aviation, and non-energy feedstock demands in the chemicals industry. Transmission infrastructure for electricity, gas and hydrogen, and candidate entry points like existing and prospective liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, as well as cross-continental pipelines, are also represented. However, no pathways are modelled in this overnight scenario, and the model has perfect operational foresight. We utilise techno-economic assumptions for 2040 and enforce net-zero CO2 emissions and limit the annual carbon sequestration to 200 \({{{{\rm{Mt}}}}}_{{{\mbox{CO}}}_{2}}\) a−1, similar to the 250 \({{{{\rm{Mt}}}}}_{{{\mbox{CO}}}_{2}}\) a−1 highlighted in the European Union's carbon management strategy70. This suffices to offset unabated industrial process emissions and limits the use of fossil fuels beyond that, whose emissions are compensated either through capturing emissions at source or by carbon dioxide removal. More details are included in the Methods section.

Green fuel and steel import costs seen by the model are based on an extension of recent research by Hampp et al.54, who assessed the levelised cost of energy exports for different green energy and material supply chains from various world regions to Europe. Our selection of exporting regions comprises all 53 coloured or dotted regions in Fig. 1a. In the TRACE optimisation model54, regional wind and solar potentials are assessed based on prevailing weather conditions and land availability while prioritising projected domestic demand. In combination with the techno-economic modelling of the various fuel-specific supply chains stages (Supplementary Fig. 1), the lowest levelised supply cost for each carrier, exporter and importer combination are determined for a reference volume of 500 TWh a−1 (or 100 Mt a−1 of steel/HBI), thus incorporating the trade-off between import cost and import location (Fig. 1b). Unlike domestic electrofuel synthesis in Europe, which could use captured CO2 from point sources, direct air capture is assumed to be the only carbon source of imported fuels. Concepts involving the shipment of captured CO2 from Europe to exporting regions for carbonaceous fuel synthesis or permanent sequestration of CO2 captured by direct air capture abroad are not considered71,72.

a shows the regional differences in the cost to deliver green methanol to Europe (choropleth layer), the cost composition of different import vectors (bar charts), an illustration of the wind and solar availability in Morocco, and an illustration of the land eligibility analysis for wind turbine placement in the region of Buenos Aires in Argentina. b depicts considered potential entry points for energy imports into Europe like the location of existing and planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and gas pipeline entry points, the lowest costs of hydrogen imports in different European regions (choropleth layer), and the considered connections for long-distance high-voltage direct current (HVDC) import links and hydrogen pipelines from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, Turkey, Ukraine and Central Asia. c displays the distribution and range of import costs for different energy carriers and entry points with indications for selected origins from the TRACE model (violin charts), i.e., differences in identically coloured markers are due to regional differences in the transport costs to alternative entrypoints. These are more variable for liquid hydrogen as transport distance is a more substantial cost factor for this import vector. Costs are given for techno-economic assumptions for 2040. Supplementary Fig. 3 shows the world map for the lowest hydrogen import costs by pipeline or ship into Europe. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Maps made with Natural Earth. Subnational regions created from geoBoundaries133. LH2 = liquefied hydrogen; PV = photovoltaics.

The import costs for each combination of carrier, exporter and importer are then included as supply options in the PyPSA-Eur model. Hydrogen and methane can be imported where there are LNG terminals in operation or under construction, or where pipeline entry points exist (except for entry points from Russia). Due to higher volatility, electricity imports are endogenously optimised, meaning that the capacities and operation of wind and solar generation, as well as storage in the respective exporting regions and the HVDC transmission lines, are co-planned with the rest of the European system. Ammonia, carbonaceous fuels, and ferrous materials are not spatially resolved in the model, assuming they can be transported within Europe at negligible cost. Thus, their specific import location is not determined. An import limit of 500 TWh per region for the sum of all exports is imposed to prevent over-reliance on single exporters.

For imports of hydrogen by pipeline, North African regions offer the lowest cost (ca. 74-88 € MWh−1, Supplementary Fig. 3). Importing hydrogen by ship is substantially more expensive due to liquefaction and evaporation losses, with a cost difference of 18% between each vector's lowest cost supplier (Supplementary Fig. 7). For hydrogen derivatives, Argentina and Chile offer additional potential for low-cost imports, for instance, 125–132 € MWh−1 for Fischer-Tropsch fuels or 548–566 € t−1 for steel. These values are similar to those achieved in the Maghreb region. Further notable regions include Australia and Canada. Methanol is slightly cheaper than the Fischer-Tropsch route because it is assumed to be more flexible with a 20% minimum part load compared to 50% for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis73. The lower process flexibility shifts the energy mix towards solar electricity and causes higher levels of curtailment and battery storage, increasing costs (Supplenmentary Fig. 9). The transport costs of CH4(l) are lower than for H2(l) since the liquefaction consumes less energy and individual ships can carry more energy with CH4(l). Pipeline imports of CH4(g) were also considered, but costs were higher than for CH4(l) shipping under the assumption that new pipelines would have to be built or renewed.

In Fig. 2, we first explore the cost reduction potential of various energy and material import options. Without energy imports, total energy system costs add up to 836 bn€2020 a−1. By enabling imports from outside Europe and considering all import vectors, we find a potential reduction of total energy system costs by up to 37 bn€2020 a−1, using technology assumptions for 2040. This corresponds to a relative reduction of 4.4%, which remains nearly unchanged regardless of the domestic crude steel and ammonia production relocation potential. With more long-term (2050) or near-term (2030) technology assumptions, the cost savings range from 3.6% to 5.4%, with higher cost savings achieved with near-term technology assumptions (Supplementary Fig. 12).

Subsets of available import options are sorted by ascending cost reduction potential. a shows the profile of total system cost savings. Shaded ranges show cost savings (%) for technology assumptions for 2030 and 2050, in addition to the default assumptions for 2040. Cost savings (%) are also shown for scenarios without crude steel and ammonia relocation, in addition to the default case where relocation is allowed. b shows the composition and extent of imports in relation to total energy system costs. Percentage numbers in the bar plot indicate the share of total system costs spent on domestic energy infrastructure. Alternative scenarios of this figure with higher and lower import cost assumptions are shown in Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. HBI = hot briquetted iron; HVDC = high-voltage direct current; bn = billion.

For cost-optimal imports, around 77% of these costs are used to develop domestic energy infrastructure. The remaining 23% are spent on importing a volume of 50 Mt of green steel and around 1498 TWh of green energy, which is around 13% of the system's total energy supply (Fig. 3). Our results show a cost-effective import mix consisting primarily of liquid carbon-based fuels, hydrogen, and steel imports with small volumes of ammonia and electricity imports.

a shows the optimised import shares by carrier for the import scenario with flexible carrier choice and volume, technology assumptions for 2040, and allowed relocation of crude steel and ammonia production. b shows the total supply for each carrier for the same scenario. c shows trade flows for the same scenario as a Sankey diagram. The flows are aggregated to broader regions to emphasise that alternative origin-destination pairs could often yield similar results. Import shares for further import scenarios are included in Supplementary Figs. 20 and 21. Steel is included in energy terms, applying a factor of 2.1 kWh kg−1 as released by the oxidation of iron. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. HBI = hot briquetted iron; HVDC = high-voltage direct current.

Next, we investigate the impact of restricting the available import options to subsets of import vectors. We find that if only hydrogen can be imported, cost savings are reduced to 20 bn€2020 a−1 (2.4%), with pipeline-based hydrogen imports being preferred to imports as liquid by ship. By importing a larger volume of hydrogen as an intermediary carrier (1338 TWh instead of 576 TWh, Supplementary Fig. 20), low-cost renewable energy from abroad can still be leveraged for the synthesis of derivative products in Europe. However, the benefit is reduced as domestic CO2 feedstocks from industrial sources are depleted.

Conversely, when direct hydrogen imports are excluded from the available import options, cost savings are close to the maximum with 34 bn€2020 a−1 (4.1%). This indicates that the benefit of using domestically captured biogenic or fossil CO2 is similar to tapping into low-cost renewable resources abroad. Focusing imports exclusively on liquid carbonaceous fuels derived from hydrogen, i.e., methanol or Fischer-Tropsch fuels, still achieves high cost savings of 31 bn€2020 a−1 (3.7%), which is due to the smaller demand or variety of applications for ammonia, methane, and steel compared to liquid carbonaceous fuels. Thus, excluding them has a small effect on cost savings. This aligns with the finding that restricting options to only methane, ammonia, or ferrous material imports yields negligible to small cost savings below 5 bn€2020 a−1 (0.6%). Negligible cost savings were also found for the direct import of electricity, as it poses more challenges for integration into the European system.

Overall, while varying import costs within  ± 20% affects the magnitude of attainable cost savings, the relative impact of restricting specific import options remains broadly consistent (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14). Likewise, using more long-term (2050) or near-term (2030) technology assumptions do not affect the dynamics substantially (Fig. 2).

Figure 3a, b outline which carriers are imported in which quantities in relation to their total supply under default assumptions when the vector and volume can be flexibly chosen (‘all imports allowed' in Fig. 2). In energy terms, cost-optimal imports comprise around 45% carbonaceous fuels, 35% hydrogen, and less than 10% electricity. Noticeably, all primary crude steel and ammonia for fertilisers is imported, whereby steel imports are preferred over HBI imports. Around half of the total hydrogen supply is imported, matching the ratio of the 2030 REPowerEU targets16. Hydrogen is imported so that it can be processed into derivative products domestically rather than used for direct applications for hydrogen. Smaller import shares are observed for electricity, which is largely supplied from domestic resources, because of higher costs and losses in electricity transmission than other import vectors, and for methane, which is supplied from domestic fossil and biogenic sources (Supplementary Fig. 24).

In terms of trade flows (Fig. 3c), we observe carbonaceous fuel imports by ship from South America – leveraging low transport costs of dense liquid fuels – as well as ammonia, steel, and hydrogen imports from the Maghreb region. Hydrogen is mainly received by pipeline in Spain. Moreover, due to its proximity to Italy, some electricity imports are received by HVDC connections from Tunisia. While the model suggests trade routes from particular regions, we aggregate these to broader regions to emphasise that alternative origin-destination pairs within the regions could often yield similar results (Supplementary Figs. 7–10).

To explain the import shares in Fig. 3a in more detail, we compare import costs with average domestic production cost split by cost and revenue components in Fig. 4. First, for the scenario without imports, imported fuels appear substantially cheaper than domestic production, which is mostly driven by levelised cost differences of wind and solar electricity supply. The high demand for hydrogen derivatives (Supplementary Fig. 4) means that the most attractive domestic potentials for renewable electricity and captured carbon dioxide have been exhausted. Consequently, power from wind and solar needs to be produced in regions with worse capacity factors and higher levelised costs.

The three panels (a–c) refer to different import scenarios. In each panel, the bar charts show the production-weighted average costs of domestic production of steel, hydrogen and its derivatives, split into its cost and revenue components. These have been computed using the marginal prices of the respective inputs and outputs for the production volume of each region and snapshot. Capital expenditures are distributed to hours in proportion to the production volume. Missing bars indicate that no domestic production occurred in the scenario, e.g., for the case of methane, where all demand is met by biogenic and fossil methane and no synthetic production occurred (cf. energy balances in Supplementary Figs. 24–25). All hydrogen is produced from electrolysis; i.e., the model did not choose to produce hydrogen via steam methane reforming with or without carbon capture. For each bar, the yellow error bars show the range of time-averaged domestic production costs across all regions. The black error bars show the range of import costs across all regions. The maps on the right of each panel relate the hydrogen production volume to the weighted cost of domestic hydrogen production (colorbar). The shown scenarios use technology assumptions for 2040, allow crude steel and ammonia relocation, and do not constraint import volume in (b, c). Confer Supplementary Fig. 22 for information on the domestic cost supply curves. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Maps made with Natural Earth. HBI = hot briquetted iron.

Part of this gap is closed when hydrogen imports are allowed. By sourcing cheaper hydrogen from outside Europe, the domestic costs of derivative fuel synthesis are reduced. However, the large remaining volume of CO2 handled in the European system for use and sequestration (Supplementary Fig. 25) means that direct air capture is still the price-setting technology for CO2, as economic applications for biogenic and industrial carbon capture (i.e., those with high full load hours) are depleted.

With all import vectors allowed, we see minimal cost differences between domestic production and imports as the supply curves reach equilibrium (Supplementary Fig. 22). This is because imports of hydrogen and derivative products lower the strain on the domestic supply curves for hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Thereby, domestic production would only ramp up where it competes with imports and associated infrastructure costs. This was the case for hydrogen, methanol, and Fischer-Tropsch fuels in the British Isles and parts of Southern Europe and Nordic countries (Fig. 4). Consequently, not all hydrogen is imported, but some domestic production is retained.

Thus far, the presented findings originate from a central estimate for the import cost. However, the cost-optimal import mix strongly depends on the assumed import costs. This uncertainty is addressed in Fig. 5. Figure 5a highlights the extensive range in potential cost reductions if higher or lower import costs could be attained and underlines the resulting variance in cost-effective import mixes. Within ± 30% of the default import costs applied to all carriers, total cost savings vary between 2 bn€2020 a−1 (0.3%) and 112 bn€2020 a−1 (13.5%). Within this range, import volumes vary between 500 and 2646 TWh. Across most scenarios, there is a stable role for ammonia and liquid carbonaceous fuel imports. Within a narrower ± 20% range, hydrogen imports also appear in larger quantities, while steel imports become less attractive with cost increases of 10% or more. Electricity imports grow with declining costs.

In (a, b), indicated relative import cost changes are applied uniformly to all vectors. In (c, d), cost changes are applied uniformly to all vectors but electricity imports. In (e, f), cost changes are only applied to carbonaceous fuels (methane, methanol and Fischer-Tropsch). a, c, e show potential system cost savings compared to the scenario without imports. b, d, f show the share and composition of different import vectors in relation to total energy system costs. The information is shown both in absolute terms and relative terms compared to the scenario without imports. Ranges in (a, c, e) show cost savings (%) for technology assumption years 2030 and 2050, in addition to 2040. All shown scenarios allow relocation of crude steel and ammonia production within Europe. HBI = hot briquetted iron; HVDC = high-voltage direct current.

However, not all carriers are equally affected by technology cost variations. Fuel synthesis technologies do not influence electricity imports, and only carbon-based fuels are subject to the cost of CO2 supply. We find that when the relative cost variation is not applied to electricity imports (Fig. 5b), they remain less attractive than other vectors, even when those alternative vectors face a 20% cost rise.

One central assumption regarding costs for carbon-based fuels is that imported fuels rely on direct air capture (DAC) as a carbon source. Arguments for this assumption relate to the potential remoteness of the ideal locations for renewable fuel production or the absence of industrial point sources in the exporting region. In contrast, domestic electrofuels can mostly use less expensive captured biogenic or fossil carbon dioxide from industrial processes. Therefore, the higher cost for DAC partially cancels out the savings from utilising better renewable resources abroad. This is one of the reasons why there is substantial power-to-X production in Europe, even with corresponding import options. However, the availability of cheaper (biogenic) CO2 in exporting regions would lower the costs of carbonaceous fuel imports (Table 1).

When the relative cost variation is only applied to carbon-based fuels (Fig. 5c), reflecting cost uncertainty in carbon provision, hydrogen imports are quickly displaced by Fischer-Tropsch and methanol imports with falling costs. Only when import costs rise by 20% do domestically produced liquid hydrocarbons – derived mainly from imported hydrogen – become more cost-effective than direct imports. In all three cases of import cost variations, methane imports become relevant only with substantial cost reductions of 40%, replacing biogas and residual fossil gas consumption.

Overall, Fig. 5 also demonstrates that the impact of import cost variations on savings remains stable with more near-term (2030) and long-term (2050) technology assumptions.

What is consistent for many scenarios with higher or lower import costs is the flat solution space around the respective cost-optimal import volumes. Increasing or decreasing the total amount of imports from the optimum barely affects system costs within  ± 1000 TWh. This is illustrated in Fig. 6 and extended Supplementary Figs. 15–18, which show the system cost as a function of enforced import volumes and different import costs for hydrogen and its derivatives. A wide range of scenarios with import volumes below 4100 TWh (2300 TWh for 20% higher import costs, 5800 TWh for -20% lower import costs) have lower total energy system costs than the no-imports scenario. These ranges of import values are two to three times as large as the corresponding cost-optimal import volumes, which are indicated by the red markers in Fig. 6 and correspond to the bars previously shown in Fig. 5b. Naturally, the cost-optimal volume of imports increases as their costs decrease, but with noticeably varying slopes for system cost savings per unit of additional imported energy.

a Solid lines show the total system cost as a function of enforced import volumes for higher (brown scale) or lower (blue scale) import costs. The dashed lines indicate the corresponding shares of the domestic system cost. The red markers denote the maximum cost reductions and cost-optimal import volume for given import cost levels (extreme points of the curves). The cost alterations are uniformly applied to all import options but direct electricity imports. Steel is included in energy terms, applying 2.1 kWh kg−1 as released by the oxidation of iron. b shows the composition of the total system cost as a function of enforced import volumes for the central import cost estimate. The dashed line splits the system costs into costs for imports and the domestic system. All shown scenarios use technology assumptions for 2040 and allow relocation of crude steel and ammonia production within Europe. Cost compositions for the alternative import cost scenarios are presented in Supplementary Figs. 15–18. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. HBI = hot briquetted iron; HVDC = high-voltage direct current.

As we explore the effect of increasing import volumes on system costs, we find that already 56% (48–80% within  ± 20% import costs) of the 4.4% (1.3–9.0%) total cost benefit can be achieved with the first 500 TWh of imports. This corresponds to 31% (25–49%) of the cost-optimal import volumes, highlighting the diminishing returns of large amounts of energy imports in Europe. The initial 1000 TWh realise 90% (80–100%) of the highest cost savings, for which primary crude steel and liquid carbonaceous fuel imports are prioritised, followed by ammonia and hydrogen and, subsequently, larger volumes of electricity beyond cost-optimal import levels. Once more than 5500 TWh (5000–8200 TWh) are imported, less than half the total system cost would be spent on domestic energy infrastructure.

As imports increase, there is a corresponding decrease in the need for domestic power-to-X (PtX) production and renewable capacities. A large share of the hydrogen, methanol, and primary steel production is outsourced from Europe, reducing the need for domestic wind and solar capacities. This trend is further characterised by the displacement of biogas usage in favour of hydrogen imports around the 4000 TWh mark (3000–5000 TWh within  ± 20% import costs) as demand for domestic CO2 utilisation drops and methane use for power and heat provision is displaced by hydrogen. The increase in hydrogen imports results in the build-out of more hydrogen fuel cell combined heat and power (CHP) units for power and heat supply in district heating networks. Regarding electricity imports from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, Fig. 6 reveals a mix of wind and solar power with some batteries to establish favourable feed-in profiles for the European system integration and higher utilisation rates for the long-distance HVDC links. For instance, for imports of 4000 TWh in Fig. 6, the capacity-weighted average utilisation rate was 85%. This is because a considerable share of the electricity import costs can be attributed to power transmission.

As import costs are varied, the composition of the domestic system and import mix for different import volumes is primarily similar (Supplementary Figs. 15–18). The main difference is a less prominent role for steel imports with higher import costs. What is furthermore noteworthy is that reducing import costs from − 30% to − 50% only marginally reduces domestic infrastructure costs, indicating largely saturated import potentials. Regarding available import options, the windows for cost savings are more limited if only subsets are available (Supplementary Fig. 19). However, up to an import volume of 1500 TWh for the central cost estimate, excluding electricity imports or constraining imports to methanol and Fischer-Tropsch fuels only, would not substantially diminish the cost-saving potential.

Across the range of import scenarios analysed, we find that the decision which import vectors are used strongly affects domestic energy infrastructure needs (Fig. 7).

Panels (a, c, e) show the regional electricity supply mix (pies), added HVDC and HVAC transmission capacity (lines), and the siting of battery storage (choropleth). Panels (b, d, f) show the hydrogen supply (top half of pies) and consumption (bottom half of pies), net flow and direction of hydrogen in newly built pipelines (lines), and the siting of hydrogen storage subject to geological potentials (choropleth). Total volumes of transmission expansion are given in TWkm, which is the sum product of the capacity and length of individual connections. The half circle in the Bay of Biscay indicates the imports of hydrogen derivatives that are not spatially resolved: ammonia, steel, HBI, methanol, Fischer-Tropsch fuels. Hydrogen imports are shown at the entry points. All shown scenarios use technology assumptions for 2040, allow steel and ammonia relocation and have no import volume constraint (when available). Maps for more scenarios are included in Supplementary Figs. 26–29. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Maps made with Natural Earth.

In the fully self-sufficient European energy supply scenario, we see large PtX production within Europe to cover the demand for hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives in steelmaking, fertilisers, high-value chemicals, green shipping, and aviation fuels. Production sites are concentrated mainly in and around the North and Baltic Seas, using wind-based electrolysis, and some additional hubs in Southern Europe using solar-based electrolysis. Electricity grid reinforcements, representing around 50% of the current transmission capacity, are focused in Northwestern Europe, with numerous long-distance HVDC connections, but are broadly distributed overall.

With a total of 57 TWkm, the hydrogen pipeline build-out is smaller, mostly serving regional connections. For several reasons, it is also considerably smaller than the 204–306 TWkm observed previously in Neumann et al.14 or the European Hydrogen Backbone reports74 which envisioned a similar order of magnitude. Besides assumed full electrification of heavy-duty road transport and assuming low CO2 transport costs from point sources to low-cost hydrogen sites75, one reason is the considered relocation of crude steel and ammonia production to where hydrogen is cheap and abundant, reducing the need to transport hydrogen (Supplementary Fig. 6). Not considering relocation of primary crude steel and ammonia production would result in a slightly larger hydrogen network of 71 TWkm (Supplementary Fig. 26), while increasing system costs by 2.5 bn€2020 a−1 (0.3%) in the no-imports scenario. With permitted relocation of ammonia and crude steel production, primary steel production shifts to the British Isles and Spain, while ammonia production moves to the Nordic-Baltic region. Both sectors become more strongly localised, with individual regions capturing a market share surpassing 30%.

However, the main reason why hydrogen consumption is mainly concentrated in regions with low-cost production is that over 80% of the hydrogen is used to produce electrofuels for aviation, shipping, and chemical feedstocks, compared to about 10% for crude steel and ammonia production. These liquid fuels can be transported at a lower cost to airports, ports, and industrial sites across Europe than hydrogen. Consequently, there is low impetus for transporting hydrogen directly, resulting in a hydrogen network that is much smaller than envisioned in the European Hydrogen Backbone74.

Considering imports of renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and electrofuels substantially alters the magnitude of energy infrastructure in Europe. Imports displace much of the European power-to-X production capacities and, particularly, domestic solar energy generation in Southern Europe. Much of the remaining derivative fuel synthesis in Southern Spain uses imported hydrogen, assuming the delivery of captured CO2 from other parts of Europe at low cost75. In contrast, the British Isles retain some domestic electrolyser capacities to produce synthetic fuels locally. Electricity imports of 131 TWh, compared to total imports of 1609 TWh, mainly enter from Tunisia at multiple nodes in Mallorca, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and mainland Italy. This distribution facilitates grid integration without strong reinforcement needs in the Italian peninsula.

While the broad regions of domestic power grid reinforcements are not significantly affected by the import of electricity and other fuels, the volume of power grid expansion is reduced by 20%. The reduction in network infrastructure is even more pronounced with the hydrogen network; the hydrogen network size is reduced by 70% with many of the North and East European connections omitted. Compared to the self-sufficiency scenario, the cost-benefit of the hydrogen network shrinks from 3 bn€2020 a−1 (0.4%) to less than 1 bn€2020 a−1 (0.1%). This is caused by substantial amounts of hydrogen derivative imports or direct processing of imported hydrogen at the entry points, which diminishes the demand for hydrogen in Europe and, hence, the need to transport it. With further 10% cheaper carbonaceous fuel imports, the hydrogen network would then shrink to 9 TWkm (Supplementary Fig. 27).

Changes in the magnitude of domestic PtX production also affect Europe's backup capacity needs. Less PtX production means lower wind and solar capacities, which reduces the amount of available generation in dark wind lulls. Next to energy storage and demand-side management of electric vehicles and heat pumps, the operational flexibility of electrolysers and derivative fuel production yields significant benefits for integrating variable wind and solar feed-in and reduces reserve capacity requirements. In a theoretical scenario without imports, where all PtX processes must run inflexibly at full capacity, system costs rise by 8.8%. Between the main scenarios with and without imports, we observe that as imported fuels displace some flexible domestic power-to-X, domestic thermal backup capacities increase from 129 GWel. (no imports allowed) to 276 GWel. (all imports allowed). Instead of curtailing the domestic production of electrofuels, backup power plants need to be dispatched. Most of these power plants are CHPs fuelled by fossil gas, providing backup heat alongside backup power when electricity prices are high during winter (Supplementary Fig. 32). The resulting emissions are then compensated elsewhere in the system through biogenic carbon dioxide removal (Supplementary Fig. 25). Spatially, these are distributed across Central Europe, while batteries provide backup power in Southern Europe (Supplementary Fig. 33). The model leverages Europe's extensive power grid to widely distribute centralised backup power, even though, in reality, individual nations may prefer maintaining domestic reserve capacities.

A further observation is the high potential value of PtX waste heat and its role in siting fuel synthesis plants (Supplementary Figs. 26 and 28). Alongside the flexible operation of electrolysis to integrate variable wind and solar feed-in and the broad availability of industrial and biogenic carbon sources in Europe, waste heat usage in district heating networks is a potential revenue stream that could make electricity and hydrogen imports with subsequent domestic conversion more attractive relative to the direct import of derivative products. Our default assumption that only 25% of the waste heat can be utilised stems from potential challenges in co-locating PtX plants with district heating networks within the 115 model regions. If all waste heat could be leveraged, notable system cost savings of 20 bn€2020 a−1 (2.4%) could be achieved in the no-imports scenario compared to a scenario where waste heat is fully vented. To realise these benefits, Fischer-Tropsch and Haber-Bosch plants tend to be geographically distributed where space heating demand is high (e.g., Paris or Hamburg) (Supplementary Fig. 26), which increases hydrogen network build-out to 98 TWkm (+ 72%) compared to the reference scenario with 25% waste heat utilisation. This is not the case for methanolisation plants, which have lower waste heat potential.

In Table 1, we present a breakdown of some potential causes for import cost variations compared to domestic supply chains relating to technology costs, financing costs, excess power and heat revenues, fuel synthesis flexibility, and the availability of geological hydrogen storage and alternative sources of CO2.

For example, we show that a higher weighted average cost of capital (WACC) than the uniformly applied 7%, e.g., due to higher project financing risks, and lower WACC, e.g., due to the government-backing of projects, strongly affect import costs76. An increase or decrease by just one percentage point already alters the unit costs by around  ± 7%. Likewise, technology cost variations abroad for electrolysers and DAC units have a strong influence. Biogenic CO2 – or fossil CO2 from industrial processes that is largely cycled between use and synthesis and, hence, not emitted to the atmosphere – can reduce the levelised fuel cost by 16% if it can be provided for 50 € t−1.

By default, we assume islanded fuel synthesis sites, which causes curtailment rates of 8%. If surplus electricity production could be sold and absorbed by the local power grid in exporting regions, additional cost reductions could be achieved. Furthermore, process integration with waste heat usage and flexible operation can also reduce fuel cost by 3−6%. Import costs are also reduced by 4% where geological hydrogen storage is available by reducing the need for flexible power-to-X operation.

In contrast, the cost impact is low if the cheapest exporting region withdraws from the market. Within a cost premium of 10% in relation to the lowest cost exporting region, Chile, ten other regions could step in if these regions were unavailable for exports (Supplementary Fig. 9).

Our analysis offers insights into how renewable energy imports might reduce overall systems costs and interact with European energy infrastructure. Our results show that imports of green energy reduce the costs of a carbon-neutral European energy system by 37 bn€2020 a−1 (4.4%), noting, however, that the uncertainty range is considerable. While we find that some imports are beneficial within a  ± 20% variation of import costs, system cost savings range between 1% and 10%. However, what is consistent within this range are the diminishing returns of energy imports for larger quantities, with peak cost savings below imports of 3000 TWh/a (equivalent to 90 Mt of hydrogen). We also find that there is value in pursuing some power-to-X production in Europe as a source of flexibility for wind and solar integration and as a potential source of waste heat for district heating networks. Another siting factor favouring European power-to-X is the wide availability of sustainable biogenic and industrial carbon sources, which helps reduce reliance on more costly direct air capture.

With reference to the meta-study by Genge et al.55, our import costs to Europe for lowest-cost to median-level-cost exporters mostly conform to the review's interquartile ranges for different carriers and technology assumptions for 2030 and 2050. Some higher costs, e.g., for ammonia, can be attributed to our updated electrolyser cost assumptions (1100/950/800€ \({{{{\rm{kW}}}}}_{\,{\mbox{el.}}\,}^{-1}\) in 2030/2040/2050), which reflect recent market developments77. Also for crude steel imports, our central cost estimate of 531 € t−1 for the lowest-cost exporter is positioned between studies with lower50 and higher67 cost estimates. Among other studies investigating the relationship between energy imports and the European energy system, several analyses report lower import shares in the range of 10–20% of total hydrogen supply58,61,62. For instance, Kountouris et al.61 see limited hydrogen imports of 182 TWh a−1 from the Maghreb region and Ukraine despite favourable import costs of 33 € \({{{{\rm{MWh}}}}}_{{H}_{2}}^{-1}\). Conversely, Wetzel et al.59 find higher import shares of 53% for methane and 43% for hydrogen. The latter closely aligns with our 49% import share for hydrogen. Wetzel et al.59 find that imports reduce system costs by 2.8%, which is also comparable to our 2.4% system cost reduction when only direct hydrogen imports are considered. The most pronounced import dependency we found in Schmitz et al.42, with import shares beyond 90% for Germany. Results in Kountouris et al.61 further substantiate our finding that derivative imports and demand relocation could diminish hydrogen network benefits.

Several limitations of our study should be noted. First, the optimisation results represent a long-term equilibrium that disregards potential transition-related infrastructure lock-ins or mid-term ramp-up constraints of export capacities or domestic infrastructure development. The development speed of key technologies is also uncertain and could affect cost-optimal infrastructure and import strategies. A further limitation is that our cost-based analysis of imports, which best reflects long-term bilateral purchase agreements, neglects price impacts of intensifying global competition for green fuel imports and exports56. Besides unclear market developments, local challenges in exporting regions, such as public acceptance for export-oriented energy projects78 and potential water scarcity41,79 to produce large amounts of hydrogen in renewable-rich but arid regions are not addressed. We also do not assess potential impacts on the regional economy and local employment effects within Europe, as some ammonia production and steel manufacturing relocates in the model. Furthermore, the model's lack of spatial resolution for CO2 means that carbonaceous hydrogen derivatives are sited where H2 is cheapest, implicitly assuming that the CO2 from biogenic or industrial sources can be transported there. However, such required CO2 pipelines could be built at relatively low additional system cost75. In the context of carbon management, more lenient assumptions on sustainable biofuel potentials, allowed levels of geological carbon sequestration, or plastic landfill could alter the results, shifting the system away from synthetic electrofuels towards more fossil fuel use with carbon capture or carbon dioxide removal75,80.

Overall, we find that the import vectors used strongly affect domestic infrastructure needs. For example, only a smaller hydrogen network would be required if hydrogen derivatives were largely imported and the domestic ammonia and crude steel industry is allowed to relocate. We also identify higher electricity backup requirements in the absence of large power-to-X flexibilities. These findings underscore the importance of coordination between energy import strategies and infrastructure policy decisions. Our results present a quantitative basis for further discussions about the trade-offs between system cost, carbon neutrality, public acceptance, energy security, infrastructure buildout, and imports.

The small differences in cost observed between some scenarios are particularly relevant because factors other than pure costs, which are not reflected in our infrastructure optimisation model, might then drive import strategies. To some, the relatively limited cost benefit of imports and offshoring of industrial production may speak against imports. Concerns about energy security could motivate more domestic supply and diversified imports. For instance, shipborne imports of hydrogen derivatives could be preferred to reduce pipeline lock-in and to mitigate the risks of sudden supply disruptions and the exercise of market power. From a practical perspective, it may also be more appealing to focus on carriers that are already globally traded commodities and to prefer infrastructure offering quick deployment.

Policymakers in Europe might prefer alternative systems featuring, for instance, lower domestic infrastructure requirements, reuse of existing infrastructure, lower technology risk, and reduced land usage for broader public support than the most cost-effective solution. Moreover, policies favoring local energy supply chains and importing intermediary products like sponge iron could be favoured to preserve European jobs while outsourcing only the most energy-intensive processes. However, in shifting potential land use and infrastructure conflicts to abroad, where population densities are often lower, potential exporting countries would need to weigh the prospect of economic development against internal social and environmental concerns, particularly in countries with a history of colonial exploitation81. Ultimately, Europe's energy strategy would likely seek to balance cost savings from green energy and material imports with broader concerns like geopolitics, economic development, public opinion, and the willingness of potential exporting countries in order to ensure a swift, secure, and sustainable energy future. Our research shows that there is manoeuvreing space around Europe's energy import strategies to accommodate such non-cost concerns.

For our analysis, we use the European sector-coupled high-resolution energy system model PyPSA-Eur82 (derivative of v0.13.0) based on the open-source modelling framework PyPSA83 (Python for Power System Analysis), covering the energy demands of all sectors including electricity, heat, transport, industry, agriculture, as well as non-energy feedstock demands, international shipping, and aviation. An overview of considered supply, consumption, and balancing technologies per carrier is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.

The model simultaneously optimises spatially explicit investments and the operation of generation, storage, conversion, and transmission assets to minimise total system costs in a single linear optimisation problem, which assumes perfect operational foresight and is solved with Gurobi (v11.0.1)84. To manage computational complexity, no pathways with multiple investment periods are calculated, but overnight scenarios targeting net-zero CO2 emissions. The capacity expansion is based on technology cost and efficiency assumptions for 2040 (see ‘Data availability'), acknowledging that much of the required infrastructure must be constructed well before reaching net-zero emissions. Figures 2 and 5 and Supplementary Fig. 29 feature additional scenarios using technology assumptions for 2030 and 2050.

Existing hydro-electric power plants85 are included, as well as nuclear power plants built after 1990 or currently under construction according to Global Energy Monitor's Global Nuclear Plant Tracker (52 GW total of 106 GW in current operation)86. While hydroelectricity is assumed to be non-extendable due to geographic constraints, additional nuclear capacities can be expanded where cost-effective. We assume the existing nuclear fleet is operated inflexibly and apply country-specific historical availability factors from 2021 to 202387.

Temporally, the model is solved with an uninterrupted 4 h equivalent resolution for a single year (2190 time steps), using a segmentation clustering approach implemented in the tsam toolbox on all time-varying data88. While weather variations between years are not considered for computational reasons, the chosen weather year 2013 is representative in terms of wind and solar availability and heat demand89. Some demands are associated with a time-varying profiles (e.g., residential/services electricity, electric vehicles, and heating demand) based on travel patterns or ambient weather conditions, while the other exogenous demands are assumed to be time-constant (e.g., kerosene, naphtha, methanol, ammonia, and industry electricity).

Spatially, the model resolves 115 European regions90, covering the European Union, the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, and the Balkan countries without Malta and Cyprus. For computational reasons, only electricity, heat, and hydrogen are modelled at high spatial resolution, while oil, methanol, methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide are treated as easily transportable without spatial constraints. Of the total final energy and non-energy demand (Supplementary Fig. 5), only some demands are spatially fixed (Supplementary Fig. 4). These include electricity for residential, industry, services, and agriculture; heat; electric vehicles; solid biomass for industry; naphtha/methanol feedstocks; and hydrogen for crude steel and ammonia production unless these industries can relocate.

Most other hydrogen demands are spatially variable. Only a small demand of 5 TWh a−1 in the chemicals industry (excluding liquid feedstocks) remains, which is offset by spatially fixed hydrogen production of around 10 TWh a−1 from chlor-alkali electrolysis for chlorine production. High-temperature industrial heat is supplied by methane, shipping and aviation use carbonaceous fuels, and land transport is fully electrified. In district heating and the power sector, backup hydrogen capacities are endogenously sized and sited just as the production capacities of hydrogen derivatives (Fischer-Tropsch, methane, methanol), which account for more than 80% of the hydrogen consumption. Since the model optimises the siting and operation of these fuel synthesis plants and electrolysers, many demands are spatially variable (e.g., electricity demand for electrolysers or hydrogen demand for methanolisation). Existing hydrogen production capacities from fossil gas reforming are not considered, as they are expected to reach the end of life over the model horizon.

A mathematical description of PyPSA-Eur can be found in Supplementary Note 1, adapted from Neumann et al.14

Networks are considered for electricity, methane, and hydrogen transport. Existing gas pipelines taken from SciGRID_gas91, can be repurposed to hydrogen in addition to new hydrogen pipelines14. Data on the gas transmission network is further supplemented by the locations of fossil gas extraction sites and gas storage facilities based on SciGRID_gas91, as well as investment costs and capacities of LNG terminals in operation or under construction from Global Energy Monitor's Europe Gas Tracker92. Geological potentials for hydrogen storage are taken from Caglayan et al.93, restricting where this low-cost storage option is available. In modelling gas and hydrogen flows, we incorporate electricity demands for compression of 1% and 2% per 1000km of the transported energy, respectively94. Existing high-voltage grid data is taken from OpenStreetMap95. For HVDC transmission lines, we assume 2% static losses at the substations and additional losses of 3% per 1000 km. The losses of high-voltage AC transmission lines are estimated using the piecewise linear approximation from Neumann et al.96, in addition to applying linearised power flow equations97. Up to a maximum capacity increase of 30%, we consider dynamic line rating (DLR), leveraging the cooling effect of wind and low ambient temperatures to exploit existing transmission assets fully98. To approximate N − 1 resilience, transmission lines may only be used up to 70% of their rated dynamic capacity99. To prevent excessive expansion of single connections, power transmission reinforcements between two regions are limited to 15 GW, while an upper limit of 50.7 GW is placed on hydrogen pipelines, which corresponds to three 48-inch pipelines94.

Renewable potentials and time series for wind and solar electricity generation are calculated with atlite100, considering land eligibility constraints like nature reserves, excluded land use types, topography, bathymetry, and distance criteria to settlements. Given low onshore wind expansion in many European countries in recent years101, a deployment density of 1.5 MW km−2 is assumed for eligible land for onshore wind expansion102. For reference, this assumption leads to an onshore wind potential for Germany of 244 GW. The temporal renewable generation potential for the available area is then assessed based on reanalysis weather data, ERA5103, and satellite observations for solar irradiation, SARAH-3104, in combination with standard solar panel and wind turbine models provided by atlite.

Biomass potentials are restricted to residues from agriculture and forestry, as well as waste and manure, based on the regional medium potentials specified for 2050 in the JRC-ENSPRESO database105. Continued use of energy crops or biomass imports are not considered. The finite sustainable biomass resource can be employed for low-temperature heat provision in industrial applications, biomass boilers, and CHPs, and (electro-)biofuel production for use in aviation, shipping, and the chemicals industry. In addition, we allow biogas upgrading, including capturing the CO2 contained in biogas, which unlocks all considered uses of regular methane (Supplementary Fig. 2). The total assumed bioenergy potentials are 1372 TWh, which splits into 358 TWh/a for biogas and 1014 TWh/a for solid biomass. The total carbon content corresponds to 605 \({{{{\rm{Mt}}}}}_{{{\mbox{CO}}}_{2}}\) a−1, which is not fully available as a feedstock for fuel synthesis or sequestration for negative emissions due to imperfect capture rates of up to 90%. Biogenic CO2 can be captured from biogas upgrading, biomass CHPs and biomass-based low-temperature heat provision in industrial use, if the added cost of carbon capture is economically viable.

The carbon management features of the model trace the carbon cycles through various conversion stages: industrial emissions, biomass and gas combustion, carbon capture in numerous applications, direct air capture, intermediate storage, electrofuels, recycling, landfill or long-term sequestration. The overall annual sequestration of CO2 is limited to 200 \({{{{\rm{Mt}}}}}_{{{\mbox{CO}}}_{2}}\) a−1, similar to the 250 \({{{{\rm{Mt}}}}}_{{{\mbox{CO}}}_{2}}\) a−1 highlighted in the European Commission's carbon management strategy70. This number allows for sequestering the industry's unabated fossil emissions (e.g., in the cement industry) while minimising reliance on carbon removal technologies. A carbon dioxide network topology is not co-optimised since CO2 is not spatially resolved. This means that the location of biogenic or industrial point sources of CO2 is not a siting factor that this model version considers for PtX processes, implicitly assuming that the CO2 would be transported there at low cost75,106.

While the shipping sector is assumed to use methanol as fuel, given its high technology-readiness level compared to hydrogen or ammonia107, land-based transport, including heavy-duty vehicles, is fully electrified in the presented scenarios108. Aviation can use green kerosene derived from Fischer-Tropsch fuels or methanol, owing to the lower technology readiness levels of fuel cell or battery-electric aircraft107. Alternative uses for methanol and Fischer-Tropsch fuels extend beyond transport, including power-to-methanol73, diesel for agriculture machinery and as feedstock for high-value chemicals.

We consider potential flexibility restrictions in the synthesis processes to obtain more realistic operational patterns of green electrofuel synthesis plants. We apply a minimum part load of 20% for methanolisation and 50% for methanation and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis109,110,111,112. The assumed lower operational flexibility is a potential disadvantage of Fischer-Tropsch over methanol synthesis, where theses fuels compete. These ‘green' options then compete with ‘blue' and ‘grey' options, such as steam methane reforming of fossil gas with or without carbon capture for hydrogen (Supplementary Fig. 2). Some carriers also feature a biogenic production route (e.g., methane and oil).

Heating supply technologies like heat pumps, electric boilers, gas boilers, and combined heat and power (CHP) plants are endogenously optimised separately for decentral use and central district heating. District heating shares of demand are exogenously set to a maximum of 60% of the total urban heat demand with sufficiently high population density. Besides the options for long-duration thermal energy storage, district heating networks can further be supplemented with waste heat from various power-to-X processes: electrolysis, methanation, ammonia synthesis, and Fischer-Tropsch fuel synthesis. Because the thermal discharge from the methanol synthesis is primarily used to distillate the methanol-water output mix73, its waste heat potential is not considered for district heat. Here, we assume a utilisable share of waste heat of 25%, considering that within the 115 regions, only a fraction of fuel synthesis plants might be connected to district heating systems. In further sensitivity analyses, we explore the effect of no or full waste heat utilisation.

The model includes a variety of options for providing backup power and heating in periods of low renewable generation and high demand (Supplementary Fig. 2). Backup power options include hydrogen, gas and methanol turbines. Backup heat options include gas boilers and resistive heaters. For combined backup heat and power, we consider biomass, hydrogen, and gas CHPs. Furthermore, flexible demands like electric vehicles, heat pumps and fuel synthesis units, as well as batteries and thermal storage in district heating, can be utilised to reduce the need for backup capacities.

Unless indicated otherwise, all scenarios also allow the model to relocate the crude steel and ammonia industry within Europe endogenously. This allows the best sites within Europe to compete with outsourced production abroad. While this captures some of the most energy-intensive industry sectors, other sectors, like concrete and alumina production, are not considered for relocation.

Without relocation of crude steel and ammonia production allowed, the production volumes of primary crude steel, by direct iron reduction (DRI) and electric arc furnace (EAF), and ammonia for fertilisers, by Haber-Bosch synthesis, are spatially fixed. This results in exogenous hydrogen demand per region. Total production volumes are based on current levels113,114. For the spatial distribution, we use data on the existing integrated steelworks listed in Global Energy Monitor's Global Steel Plant Tracker115 and manually collected data on the location and size of ammonia plants in Europe.

With the relocation of crude steel and ammonia production allowed, the model endogenously chooses the regional production volumes of primary crude steel, HBI, and ammonia, subject to the availability of cheap hydrogen. Thereby, the regional capacities and operation of Haber-Bosch, DRI, and EAF plants are co-optimised with the rest of the system, similar to the siting of Fischer-Tropsch or methanolisation plants. For DRI and EAF, investment costs and specific requirements for fuels and iron ore are taken from the Steel Sector Transition Strategy Model (ST-STSM) of the Mission Possible Partnership116,117. and assume steel can be stored and transported without constraints within Europe.

For both cases, we assume a rise in the steel recycling rate from 40% today to 70% in our carbon-neutral scenarios118. We assume that the electric arc furnaces for secondary steel remain, in proportion, at current locations and do not relocate.

A limitation of the relocation modelling of crude steel and ammonia production is that it only considers the cost of energy in the siting of these industries. Other factors, such as impacts on regional economies and local jobs, integration with other production processes, or availability of other existing infrastructure, are not considered, largely due to a lack of data. The resulting relocation patterns should therefore be interpreted with caution, as they might underestimate total relocation costs and frictions. We allow domestic relocation, nevertheless, in most scenarios, as it would be inconsistent to allow crude steel and ammonia imports from abroad while preventing relocation within Europe.

The European energy system model is extended with data from the TRACE model (derivative of v1.1) used in Hampp et al.54 to assess the unit costs of different vectors for importing green energy and material to entry points in Europe from various world regions. For consistency with the European model, the techno-economic assumptions were aligned, using the same values for 2040 (plus 2030 / 2050 in Fig. 2 and 5 and Supplementary Fig. 29 and a uniform weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7%119. As possible import vectors, we consider electricity by transmission lines, hydrogen as a gas by pipelines and as a liquid by ship, methane as a liquid by ship, liquid ammonia, crude steel and HBI, methanol and Fischer-Tropsch fuels by ship. Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) are not considered as export vectors due to their lower technology readiness level (TRL) compared to other vectors1.

Our selection of 53 potential exporting regions broadly comprises countries with favourable wind and solar resources and large enough potential for substantial exports above 500 TWh a−1 in addition to domestic consumption. We exclude some countries due to political instability (e.g., Sudan, Somalia, Yemen), using a Fragile States Index120 value of 100 as a threshold, or due to severe imposed sanctions (e.g., Russia, Iran, Iraq), following the EU Sanctions Map121. Landlocked countries without access to seaports or realistic pipeline connections are excluded. For landlocked regions within pipeline reach, we only exclude shipborne vectors. Some large countries are split into multiple subregions for a more differentiated view (e.g., USA, Argentina, Brazil, and China). The resulting regions are marked in Fig. 1A.

To determine the levelised cost of energy for exports, the methodology first assesses the regional potentials for solar, onshore, and offshore wind energy. These potentials and time series are calculated using atlite100, applying similar land eligibility constraints as in PyPSA-Eur (but using other datasets with global coverage) and applying the same wind turbine and solar panel models to ERA5103 weather data for 2013 in eligible regions. Since TRACE evaluates whole regions without further transmission network resolution, the renewable potentials and profiles within a region are split into different resource classes to reduce smoothing effects. We consider 30 classes each for onshore wind and solar, and 10 for offshore wind, where applicable. Based on these calculations, levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) curves can be determined for each region. A selection of LCOE curves is shown in Supplementary Fig. 22.

In the next step, potentials are reduced by the projected future local energy demand, starting with the lowest LCOE resource classes. With this approach, domestic consumption is prioritised and supplied by the regions' best renewable resources, even though we do not model the energy transition in exporting regions in detail. To create the demand projections, we use the GEGIS122 tool, which utilises machine learning on historical time series, weather data, and macro-economic factors to create artificial electricity demand time series based on population and gross domestic product (GDP) growth scenarios following the SSP2 scenario of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways123. From these time series, we take the annual total and increase it by a factor of two to account for further electrification of other sectors, which the GEGIS tool does not consider.

The remaining wind and solar electricity supply can then be used to produce the specific energy or material vector according to the flow chart of conversion pathways shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Considered technologies include water electrolysis for H2, direct air capture (DAC) for CO2, synthesis of methane, methanol, ammonia or Fischer-Tropsch fuels from H2 with CO2 or N2, and H2 direct iron reduction (DRI) for sponge iron with subsequent processing to green steel in electric arc furnaces (EAF) from iron ore priced at 97.7 € t−1116. Other CO2 sources than DAC are not considered in the exporting regions. Furthermore, while batteries and hydrogen storage in steel tanks are considered, underground hydrogen storage is excluded due to the uncertain availability of salt caverns in many potential exporting regions124,125. We also assume that the energy supply chains dedicated to exports will be islanded from the rest of the local energy system, i.e., that curtailed electricity or waste heat could not be used locally.

For each vector, an annual reference export demand of 500 TWhLHV or 100 Mt of crude steel and HBI is assumed, mirroring large-scale energy and material infrastructures and export volumes, corresponding to approximately 40% of current European LNG imports126 and 66% of European steel production127. Transport distances are calculated between the exporting regions and the twelve representative European import locations using the searoute Python tool128 for shipborne vectors or crow-fly distances for pipeline or HVDC connections, and modified by a mode-specific detour factor. The chosen representative import locations are based on large ports and LNG terminals in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Poland, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, as well as pipeline entry points in Slovakia, Greece, Italy, and Spain. All energy supply chains are assumed to consume their energy vector as fuel for transport to Europe, except for HBI and crude steel, which use externally bought green methanol as shipping fuel. The capital costs of the ships and pipelines are also included, following the metholodogy of Hampp et al.54.

For each combination of carrier, exporter, and importer, a linear capacity expansion optimisation is performed to determine cost-optimal investments and the operation of generation, conversion, storage, and transport capacities for all intermediary products to deliver 500 TWh a−1 (or 100 Mt a−1 for materials) of the final carrier to Europe. Dividing the total annual system costs by the targeted annual export volume yields the levelised cost of energy or material as seen by the European entry point. To match the multi-hourly resolution used for the European model, the TRACE model was configured to use a 3-hourly resolution for 2013, resulting in similar balancing requirements. Considering the reference export volume of 500 TWh a−1 (or 100 Mt a−1 for materials), the resulting levelised cost curves of imports for different import vectors and exporting regions are presented for the respective lowest-cost entry point to Europe in Supplementary Figs. 7–10. The curves show the varying cost composition of the country-carrier pairs. In this step, each import vector combination of carrier, exporter, and importer is optimised separately. Further constraints, like constraints on total export volumes per country, are imposed in the coupling to the European model.

A mathematical description of TRACE can be found in Section S3 in Hampp et al.54

The resulting levelised unit cost for each combination of carrier, exporter, and reference importer is then used as an exogenous input to the European model. For each candidate entry point in the 115 European model regions, we match the closest reference import location from TRACE and add the corresponding import cost curve as a supply option (Supplementary Figs. 7–10). Moreover, we limit energy exports from any one exporting region to Europe for the sum of all carriers to 500 TWh a−1. This is to both prevent a single country from dominating the import mix and be consistent with the target export volume assumed in TRACE. Beyond that, the decision about the origin, destination, vector, volume, and timing of imports is largely endogenous to PyPSA-Eur.

However, imports may be further restricted by the expansion of domestic import infrastructure. For each vector, we identify locations where the respective carrier may enter the European energy system by considering where LNG terminals and cross-continental pipelines are located (Fig. 1b). For hydrogen imports by pipeline, imports must be near-constant, varying between 90–100% of peak imports, aligning with the high pipeline utilisation rates observed in the TRACE model. For methane imports by ship, existing LNG terminals reported in Global Energy Monitor's Europe Gas Tracker92 can be used. For hydrogen by ship, new terminals can be built in regions where LNG terminals exist. To ensure regional diversity in potential gas and hydrogen imports and avoid vulnerable singular import locations, we allow the expansion beyond the reported capacities only up to a factor of 2.5, taking the median value of reported investment costs for LNG terminals129. A premium of 20% is added for hydrogen import terminals due to the lack of practical experience with them. For electricity, the capacity and operational patterns of the HVDC links can be endogenously optimised. Imports for carbonaceous fuels, ammonia, HBI, and steel are not spatially allocated to specific ports, given their low transport costs relative to value. Port capacities are assumed unconstrained since these commodities, particularly carbonaceous fuels, are comparable to the large fossil oil volumes currently handled at European ports.

Further conversion of imported fuels is also possible once they have arrived in Europe, e.g., hydrogen could be used to synthesise carbon-based fuels, ammonia could be cracked to hydrogen, methane could be reformed to hydrogen, and methane or methanol could be combusted for power generation. However, conversion losses can make it less attractive economically to use a high-value hydrogen derivative merely as a transport and storage vessel, only to reconvert it back to hydrogen or electricity.

The supply chain of electricity imports is endogenously optimised with the rest of the European system rather than using a constant levelised cost of electricity for each export region. This is because, owing to the greater challenge of storing electricity, the hourly variability of wind and solar electricity leads to higher price variability than hydrogen and its derivatives, and the intake needs to be more closely coordinated with the European power grid. The endogenous optimisation comprises wind and solar capacities, batteries and hydrogen storage in steel tanks, and the size and operation of HVDC link connections to Europe based on the renewable capacity factor time series as illustrated in Fig. 1b. Europe's connection options with exporting regions are confined to the 4% nearest regions, with additional ultra-long distance connection options to Ireland, Cornwall, and Brittany following the vision of the Xlinks project between Morocco and the United Kingdom30. Connections through Russia or Belarus are excluded. In addition to excluded entry points, some connections from Central Asia are affected by additional detours beyond the regularly applied detour factor of 125% of the as-the-crow-flies distance. Similar to intra-European HVDC transmission, a 3% loss per 1000km and a 2% converter station loss are assumed.

Finally, we note that all mass-energy conversion is based on the lower heating value (LHV). To present energy and material imports in a common unit, the embodied energy in steel is approximated with the 2.1 kWh kg−1 released in iron oxide reduction, i.e., energy released by combustion130. All currency values are given in €2020.

Scientists have made a key breakthrough for treating respiratory diseases by developing a new drug delivery system that transports genetic therapies directly to the lungs, opening promising possibilities for patients with conditions like lung cancer and cystic fibrosis.

The research, led by Gaurav Sahay of Oregon State University's College of Pharmacy, was conducted in collaboration with Oregon Health & Science University and the University of Helsinki. Findings were published in a pair of papers, in Nature Communications and the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

Scientists created and tested more than 150 different materials and discovered a new type of nanoparticle that can safely and effectively carry messenger RNA and gene-editing tools to lung cells. In studies with mice, the treatment slowed the growth of lung cancer and helped improve lung function that had been limited by cystic fibrosis, a condition caused by one faulty gene.

Researchers also developed a chemical strategy to build a broad library of lung-targeting lipids used in the nanocarriers. These materials form the foundation for the new drug delivery system and could be customized to reach different organs in the body, Sahay said.

"The streamlined synthesis method makes it easier to design future therapies for a wide range of diseases," he said. "These results demonstrate the power of targeted delivery for genetic medicines. We were able to both activate the immune system to fight cancer and restore function in a genetic lung disease, without harmful side effects."

Oregon State's K. Yu Vlasova, D.K. Sahel, Namratha Turuvekere Vittala Murthy, Milan Gautam and Antony Jozic were co-authors of the Nature Communications paper, which also included scientists from OHSU and the University of Helsinki. OSU's Murthy, Jonas Renner, Milan Gautam, Emily Bodi and Antony Jozic teamed with Sahay on the other study.

"Our long-term goal is to create safer, more effective treatments by delivering the right genetic tools to the right place," said Sahay. "This is a major step in that direction."

These studies were funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

Metrics details

Interfacial exchange coupling between antiferromagnets (AFMs) and ferromagnets (FMs) crucially makes it possible to shift the FM hysteresis, known as exchange bias, and to switch AFM states. Two-dimensional magnets unlock opportunities to combine AFM and FM materials; however, the buried AFM–FM interfaces obtained by stacking remains challenging to understand. Here we demonstrate interfacial control via intralayer exchange coupling in the layered AFM CrPS4, where connected even and odd layers realize pristine lateral interfaces between AFM-like and FM-like regions. We distinguish antiphase even-layer states by scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre magnetometry due to a weak surface magnetization. This surface magnetization enables control over the even-layer state, with different regions switching at distinct fields due to their own lateral couplings. We toggle three AFM domains adjacent to a FM-like region and demonstrate a tunable multilevel exchange bias. Our nanoscale visualization unveils the microscopic origins of exchange bias and advances single two-dimensional crystals for hybrid AFM–FM technologies.

Tesla sued a former engineer for allegedly stealing trade secrets from its humanoid robotics program, Optimus, and using them to launch a rival startup.

The lawsuit, which was filed on Wednesday and originally reported on by Bloomberg, accuses Zhongjie “Jay” Li of stealing trade secrets regarding Tesla's development of “advanced robotic hand sensors” to launch his startup Proception, a Y Combinator-backed company building robotic hands.

The complaint states that Li, who worked at Tesla from August 2022 to September 2024, downloaded confidential information about Optimus on two separate personal smartphones.

The complaint also added that during the last few months of his time at Tesla, Li researched “humanoid robotic hands” on his workplace computer in addition to making internet searches regarding venture capital and other startup funding sources.

“Less than a week after he left Tesla, Proception was incorporated,” the complaint stated. “And within just five months, Proception publicly claimed to have ‘successfully built' advanced humanoid robotic hands—-hands that bear a striking resemblance to the designs Li worked on at Tesla.”

Proception's website states the company is working to “revolutionize human-robot interaction by building the world's most advanced humanoid hands.”

TechCrunch reached out to Proception and Tesla for more information.

Tesla's Optimus robotics program has been on a bit of a rocky path since the company unveiled it was building a humanoid robot, Tesla Bot, in 2021. In 2022, the company said that the bot, alongside other new products, would be introduced in 2023. But Optimus has remained in development.

In July 2024, Tesla's Elon Musk said that the company would begin selling the robot in 2026. Just a few months later at Tesla's “We, Robot” event in October 2024, Tesla's Optimus bots in attendance were largely controlled by humans offsite.

New York-based micromobility startup Infinite Machine has revealed a seated scooter called Olto that will cost $3,495 when it starts shipping later this year. 

The Olto will feature 40 miles of range, pulled from an easily swappable 48V lithium-ion battery. Infinite Machine says the Olto will have a top speed of 20 miles per hour in bike lines and “33mph off-road,” powered by a 750W rear hub motor. There is a headlight with high and low beams, as well as turn signals, to help with visibility on the road.

Infinite Machine is also promising the Olto is modular, with the ability to attach or detach elements you might find on a larger cargo bike, like a child carrier, rear rack, or basket. There are even fold-out pedals that can provide pedal-assist propulsion via a chain connected to the rear wheel, which lets the rider use the Olto sort of like an e-bike. And Infinite Machine says the Olto can seat two people, supported by the vehicle's dual-suspension frame.

It's a hefty price tag, but it's less than half of what Infinite Machine is charging for its flagship Cybertruck-style two-wheeler, the P1. That vehicle, which the startup has begun shipping to its first customers, costs $10,000.

The Olto is the newest entry into the always-churning market for electric two-wheelers. That churn has been difficult to navigate, especially in the United States. One of the leading American e-bike brands, Rad Power Bikes, has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs and recently changed its leadership. International brands have struggled to find a foothold in the U.S., too, contributing to the bankruptcy restructurings of VanMoof and Cake. 

Infinite Machine began turning heads with the design of the P1 scooter in 2023. It ultimately secured $9 million in late 2024 in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Founder and CEO Joseph Cohen told TechCrunch at the time that his goal for Infinite Machine was to ultimately have vehicles in every major city around the world.

In the near-term, though, Infinite Machine is focused on the U.S. market — which is a challenging place to sell vehicles like the Olto.

“We think that what we can bring as an American company is an amazing product sensibility that doesn't exist with the products in the market, and that's the angle that we're taking,” Cohen told TechCrunch last year. “We are coming into this category and saying, you know, these plastic things that look like printers, we can do it better. We can make something that feels like your favorite car — but not a car, but something that extends to the city.”

Mel Brooks is really taking this Spaceballs thing seriously. In the original film, one of his characters, Yogurt, was a parody of Yoda, the Star Wars Jedi Master who lived to be almost 1,000. Well, now we know Brooks has been going all in on character preparation and, at the age of 99, will officially reprise Yogurt for the long-awaited sequel, set for release 40 years after the original. And that's just the beginning. Here's a hilarious teaser making it all official.

Amazon announced Thursday that Brooks, who wrote, directed, and starred in the 1987 comedy classic, will return as Yogurt in the sequel, scheduled for theatrical release in 2027. This time he'll just be acting, though, with Josh Greenbaum (Barb and Star Go To Vista Del Mar) directing from a script by Benji Samit, Dan Hernandez, and Josh Gad. Gad is also expected to star, but that has yet to be officially confirmed. Bill Pullman and Rick Moranis are also expected to return, along with newcomer Keke Palmer in a mystery role.

Fans have been waiting for a sequel to Spaceballs for decades. Literally. The original film joked about a sequel, called Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money, which was not meant to happen. But, at that time, Star Wars was thought to be done for good. A decade later, that changed. First were the Star Wars Special Editions in 1997, then the prequels from 1999-2005, then Disney bought the franchise and has been releasing shows and movies since 2015. The Force is strong once again, and now, it's time for Spaceballs to return.

But what will it be about? Amazon says that it's “A Non-Prequel Non-Reboot Sequel Part Two but with Reboot Elements Franchise Expansion Film.” Not much of a help. But, the teaser also says “The Schwartz Awakens,” so you have to imagine Gad and crew will go with a take inspired by the sequel trilogy, peppering in classic characters like Lone Star (Pullman) and Dark Helmet (Moranis) with a larger focus on new characters (such as Palmer and Gad) who learn the power of the Schwartz. And, of course, we know Yogurt will return too.

How are we feeling about Spaceballs 2? Are you confident that this can be the sequel we've always wanted? And does Brooks' addition make it feel more real in a way? Let us know below.

Update June 12 1:50 p.m. – After we published this story, Deadline further reported that Rick Moranis and Bill Pullman may also return for the sequel, alongside Keke Palmer in a new role. Read more here, but we've added that news to this story.

AMD unveiled its new MI350X and MI355X GPUs for AI workloads here at its Advancing AI 2025 event in San Jose, California, claiming the new accelerators offer a 3X performance boost over the prior-gen MI300X, positioning the company to improve its competitive footing against its market-leading rival, Nvidia. AMD claims it beats Nvidia in like-for-like inference benchmarks by up to 1.3X and leads by up to 1.13X in select training workloads. 

AMD also claims a 4X increase in "AI compute performance" compared to prior-generation AMD MI300X models and a 35X increase in inference performance, largely achieved by transitioning to the CDNA 4 architecture and utilizing a smaller, more advanced process node for the compute chiplets. AMD's production MI350 platforms began shipping last month. 



These two MI300 Series AI GPUs will power AMD rack-level solutions for the remainder of the year and into 2026 as the company builds to its MI400 rollout. 

The MI350X and MI355X share an identical underlying design, featuring up to 288GB of HBM3E memory, up to 8 TB/s of memory bandwidth, and new support for the FP4 and FP6 data types. However, the MI350X is geared for air-cooled solutions with a lower Total Board Power (TBP), while the MI355X pushes power consumption up a notch for liquid-cooled systems geared for the highest performance possible.

AMD will not release an APU version of this chip like it did with last generation's MI300A, which featured both CPU and GPU cores on a single die. In contrast, this generation will have GPU-only designs. 

AMD's MI355X comes with 1.6 times the HBM3E memory capacity of Nvidia's competing GB200 and B200 GPUs, but delivers the same 8TB/s of memory bandwidth. AMD claims a 2X advantage in peak FP64 / FP32 over Nvidia's chips, which isn't surprising given Nvidia's optimization focus on the more AI-friendly lower-precision formats. Notably, MI350's FP64 matrix performance has been halved compared to MI300X, though vector performance drops by roughly 4% gen-over-gen.

As we move down to lower-precision formats, such as FP16, FP8, and FP4, you can see that AMD generally matches or slightly exceeds the Nvidia comparables. One notable standout is FP6 performance, which runs at FP4 rates, which AMD sees as a differentiating feature. 

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

As we've also seen with Nvidia's competing chips, the new design and heightened performance also come with increased power consumption, which tops out at a 1,400W Total Board Power (TBP) for the liquid-cooled high-performance MI355X model. That's a marked increase from the MI300X's 750W and the MI325X's 1,000W thermal envelopes.

AMD says this increase in performance density allows its customers to cram more performance into a single rack, thereby decreasing the all-important performance-per-TCO (total cost of ownership) metric, which quantifies performance-per-dollar at the rack level.

The new chips feature numerous advancements in performance, but the fundamental design principles of merging 3D and 2.5D packaging technology remain unchanged, with the former being used to fuse the Accelerator Compute Dies (XCD) with the I/O Dies (IOD), while the latter is used to connect the IOD to each other and the 12-Hi HBM3E stacks. 

The chip features eight total XCD chiplets, each with 32 compute units (CU) enabled, for a total of 256 CU (AMD has four CU in reserve per XCD to improve yield; these are disabled as needed). The XCD's transition from 5nm with the prior generation to dies fabbed on TSMC's N3P process node for the MI350 series. The total chip weilds a whopping 185 billion transistors, a 21% increase in the transistor budget over the prior generation's 153 billion. 

Additionally, while the I/O Die (IOD) remains on the N6 process node, AMD has reduced the IOD from four tiles to two to simplify the design. This reorganization enabled AMD to double the Infinity Fabric bus width, improving bi-sectional bandwidth to up to 5.5 TB/s, while also reducing power consumption by lowering the bus frequency and voltage. This reduces uncore power requirements, allowing more power to be spent on compute. 

As with the MI300 series, the Infinity Cache (memory-side cache) sits in front of the HBM3E (32MB of cache per HBM stack).  

The completed processor connects to the host via a PCIe 5.0 x16 interface and presents itself as a single logical device to the host. The GPU communicates with other chips via seven Infinity Fabric links, providing a total of 1,075 GB/s of throughput. 

Both the MI350X and MI355X come in an OAM form factor and drop into the standardized UBB form factor servers (OCP spec), the same as prior-gen MI300X. AMD says this speeds time to deployment.

The chips communicate with one another via an all-to-all topology with eight accelerators per node communicating across 153.6 GB/s bi-directional Infinity Fabric links. Each node is powered by two of AMD's fifth-gen EPYC 'Turin' chips. 

AMD supports all forms of networking, but positions its new Pollara Ultra Ethernet Consortium-capable NICs (UEC) as an optimum scale-out solution, while the Ultra Accelerator Link (UAL) interconnect is employed for scale-up networking. 

AMD offers both Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) and Air Cooled (AC) racks. The DLC racks feature 128 MI355X GPUs and 36TB of HBM3E, thanks to the increased density provided by the liquid cooling subsystem, which enables the use of smaller node form factors. The AC solutions top out at 64 GPUs and 18TB of HBM3E, utilizing larger nodes to dissipate the thermal load via air cooling. 

AMD has tremendously increased its focus on unleashing the power of rack-scale architectures, a glaring deficiency relative to Nvidia. AMD has undertaken a series of acquisitions and developed a strong and expanding roster of partner OEMs to further its goals. 

As one would expect, AMD shared some of its performance projections and benchmarks against not only its own prior-gen systems, but also against Nvidia comparables. As always, take vendor-provided benchmarks with a grain of salt. We have included the test notes below for your perusal.

AMD claims an eight-GPU MI355X setup ranges from 1.3X faster with four MI355X vs four DGX GB200 in Llama 3.1 405B, to 1.2X faster with eight MI355X against an eight-GPU B200 HGX config in inference in DeepSeek R1, and equivalent performance in Llama 3.1 405B (all tested at FP4). 

AMD also says MI355X is also competitive with Nvidia's B200 and GB200 in training workloads, though here it highlights either parity or a slight 1.13X performance advantage in a range of LLama models. 

AMD says the MI355X provides up to 4.2X more performance over the MI300X in AI Agent and Chatbot workloads, along with strong gains ranging from 2.6X to 3.8X in content generation, summarization, and conversational AI work. Other generational highlights include a 3X generational improvement in DeepSeek R1 and a 3.3X gain in Llama 4 Maverick.  

We will update this article as AMD shares more details during its keynote, which is occurring now.

The pro case for privatisation (that I happen to believe in) is: you were paying for it anyway, via your tax dollars, having it private leads to competition and stronger incentives to improve/cut costs meaning it will net cost you less.


reply



I'm fine if they want to make new weather balloons and sell them to people to launch for whatever reason they want. Selling what by law should be public data is anathema.

It is not like this company is going to take over the management of weather balloons you have already paid for. Or I don't know how you imagine this is going to work.>  This is not privatization in the way that you seem to think it is.Can you tell me more about how you think it is?

Can you tell me more about how you think it is?


reply



What do you think taxes are? Do we pay taxes once and that's it?


reply



So, put another way, is it better for the government to continue going into debt to operate projects like this with potentially dubious returns - or better to allow the private industry to find a way to operate it instead?


reply



Yes. The government is not a business. It does not need to turn a profit. Government services are not products for the generation of profit.






reply



About 30% of Americans get (NWS) weather data for free. They pay no income tax yet receive the same level of public benefits. On the other hand, a handful of Americans pay millions for weather data, and receive the same thing as those who paid nothing.For a private service though, it would just be $20/mo or whatever for everyone.

reply



On the matter of taxes being proportional to income, I'm not going to argue about progressive taxation or any moralistic standpoint of proportional taxation. From purely a utility standpoint, those handful of people probably reap way more value from that NWS data being available. The richest people (those paying the millions for NWS) usually are that rich from the labor of others, and those labor forces all get value from the data to help plan their days, including getting to the workplace safely. Another even more direct use for the economy would be routing of trucks through snowy passes, or planning for large construction companies.


reply



Nothing else you said is wrong, I'm just saying that government services are effectively progressively priced based on income.


reply



Looking around, the exact number is quite hard to pin down because of the definition of it, but ~30% is probably a very fair estimate based on https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tpc-number-those-who-dont...


reply



Weather reporting is a common good. It worked very well for pennies and benefitted the economy greatly. Why privatize it?


reply



And the government already buys the helium, radiosondes, and ground systems from private vendors—so the money's going to private industry anyway. It's just inefficient.With 50 of our systems doing 4 profiles a day (which is no where close to max scale), you get the same volume of data for way less. And on top of that, because we reach remote and oceanic areas that aren't being measured today, the data is also more valuable!Also, the data you're referring to isn't inherently public domain. It becomes public when the government buys it and redistributes it. That's true whether they pay for the infrastructure themselves or buy the data directly from a company.

And on top of that, because we reach remote and oceanic areas that aren't being measured today, the data is also more valuable!Also, the data you're referring to isn't inherently public domain.

My problem is with baseline services that have already been stopped that you claim to want to replace. This data feeds all of our weather models and should be done with existing infrastructure until congress changes things. The data must be freely available.The fact is that the data is available for anyone anywhere and is a valuable resource for scientists everywhere. Your current goals might be laudable right now, but that is not going to be the case when you have to pay back an investor 100x in 5 years. You will do everything you can to lock that data up and make it as expensive as you can. You will have no choice.

I agree that weather data should be public but I don't see why we should restrict innovation in the private market if there is demand for it.Also more generally, I see no issue in the government outsourcing work to a competitive private market wherever possible.

The current regime has upended that process and has created a situation where the government has no choice but to outsource data gathering to third parties. This is corruption and not in the spirit or the letter of the law.This startup is attempting to take advantage of an illegal situation which is just ridiculous.I'm happy if they want to sell fancy weather balloons to anyone that they want, even the government, but selling data back to the government that should be already collecting the data in the first place BY LAW is just corrupt.

Arm CEO Rene Haas has joined Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in criticizing U.S. export controls of AI semiconductors to China, a move he says could slow the overall advance of the technology, impacting both consumers and industry players, as reported by Bloomberg.

Speaking at the Founders Forum Global conference in Oxford, Haas said, "If you narrow access to technology and you force other ecosystems to grow up, it's not good... It makes the pie smaller, if you will. And frankly, it's not very good for consumers." He also touched on Arm's footprint in China, noting the company's presence is "quite significant."

Washington enacted curbs on the exports of data center processors to China in April, a measure that has reportedly cost Nvidia $8 billion and has largely shut it out of the market.

In May, Huang branded Trump's export controls "a failure," and warned they were having the opposite effect on the market as intended. Rather than stifling China's growth in AI to give the U.S. an advantage, Huang postulated that the ban was pushing Chinese rivals, including Huawei, to accelerate growth and innovation in AI, ultimately leading to more competitive offerings. He lamented that due to the ban, which directly affects its H200 chip, Nvidia had had to write off the equivalent of a semiconductor company from its bottom line.

Continuing his own lobbying efforts, Haas revealed he has spent "far more time in Washington in the last year and a half than I have in my entire career," but admitted that the current administrationt has "a lot of smart people who are who are connected to our industry," adding that he thought Arm's voice was being heard.

He also gave a nod to Huang, describing him as a fierce competitor and a fast innovator. This week at VivaTech in Paris, Huang warned that if AI chip restrictions continue, Huawei will take advantage, stating "our technology is a generation ahead of theirs," but warned that "If the United States doesn't want to partake, participate in China, Huawei has got China covered, and Huawei has got everybody else covered."

Smartphone startup Nothing will sell its next flagship model, the Nothing Phone (3), in the U.S. through its website and Amazon, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. 

Nothing, which will unveil the new phone early next month in London, has released eight phones since its inception in 2020, but only one, the Phone (2), has made it to general sale in the U.S. so far. Before that, users had to sign up to buy a phone via a beta program, and there was no after-sales support, though you could return the device within 14 days to get a full refund.

“We have always said we are building for the long term, and now we're ready to take that next step in the U.S. Phone (3) is not just another launch. It is a signal of where we are as a company. The smartphone market in the U.S. is dominated by two players, but a lot of people are hungry for something different,” Carl Pei, Nothing's CEO and the co-founder of OnePlus, told TechCrunch.

“We have already seen strong conversion rates from users switching to Nothing, and with Phone (3), we are going after that opportunity in a much more focused way. This is the right product, and the right moment, to start scaling in North America,” he added.

Pei is banking on the fact that Nothing's focus on differentiating the design of its smartphones will attract people who are looking for alternatives to Apple, Samsung, and Google.

Out of the box, Phone (3) will support AT&T and T-Mobile coverage with multi-band support for 4G and 5G — that's a step up from the limited carrier compatibility of its previous models  Phone (2a), Phone (2a) Plus, and CMF Phone 1. 

And in Canada, Nothing is partnering with Best Buy to sell its new flagship, along with a new over-ear headphone model, Headphone (1), on retail channels for the first time.

In a video in March, Pei said Nothing Phone 3 will feature premium materials, major performance upgrades, and “software that really levels things up.”  He also said the device would be priced around £800, which might translate to around $1,000 in the U.S. That would put the Phone (3) in direct competition with the iPhone 16 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S25+.

According to research firm Counterpoint Research, Nothing's shipment numbers for 2024 were in the “low-single-digit millions,” and India was its biggest market.

The firm's senior research analyst, Maurice Klaehne, told TechCrunch that Google and Motorola have made some inroads in the U.S. in the premium devices market, which is dominated by Samsung and Apple. He added that while Pei's former company, OnePlus, also sells unlocked devices in the U.S., its shipment volumes are low. This means Nothing has an uphill climb ahead in the North American market.

Nothing has so far raised more than $250 million over multiple rounds.

If AI developers continue flocking to China, the US will lose its competitive edge


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


"Huawei has got China covered," shared Nvidia boss Jensen Huang when speaking with reporters at VivaTech in Paris this year. Huang warns of potential misplays that could hand a major win to China in the current AI race as the US turns to trade isolationism.

China currently stands as the world's second-largest economy, with Huawei being its most notable tech firm. The U.S.-China trade war over advanced chips has been raging for years, and while the U.S. stands as the top dog today, recent decisions from the U.S. government threaten its lead.

“Our technology is a generation ahead of theirs,” said Huang of Huawei, a claim that Huawei itself affirms internally. But this was followed with a warning: "If the United States doesn't want to partake, participate in China, Huawei has got China covered, and Huawei has got everybody else covered."

Since 2020, the U.S. has entertained a policy of banning any large Chinese tech firms from access to advanced chipmaking technologies by placing them on the Department of Commerce's "Entity List", noting firms with ties to foreign security risks, and also by heavily restricting trade of U.S. leading-edge technology into China.

However, the situation has escalated in recent weeks as President Trump has launched a more intense tariff offensive against China. The Trump administration recently pledged to "aggressively revoke visas of Chinese students," a move China has responded to by calling its students home and recruiting more AI researchers to its institutions.

"If we want the American technology stack to win around the world, then giving up 50% of the world's AI researchers is not sensible," warns Huang. "So long as all the AI developers are in China, you know, I think [the] China stack is going to win. And so we just have to be mindful of near-term actions on long-term, unintended consequences."

Concerns of China outpacing and soon surpassing U.S. tech research and production are not new or unfounded. A recent report found that China has doubled the U.S.'s research output on next-generation chip technologies over the last ten years, with a majority of the most-cited and highest-quality studies coming from China. This gulf is only expected to increase as the Trump administration begins to "renegotiate" CHIPS Act contracts, along with its move to defund research institutions.

Huang was careful not to criticize or place blame on the Trump administration for recent policy changes that potentially give an edge to China. The president "knows what he's doing," says Jensen. "He has a game plan. I trust him, and we'll support him the best we can."

As for Huawei, it knows it still has work to do to reach its U.S. competition. Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei recently shared, "The United States has exaggerated Huawei's achievements. Huawei is not that great. We have to work hard to reach their evaluation." While Huawei may be humble about its current capabilities, the firm is still nothing to sneeze at, as a leading bastion in various Chinese domestic chip initiatives. As China continues to bolster its domestic chip industry, time will tell if modern U.S. trade initiatives are doing more to help than hinder its progress.

Charging your phone and all the other tech items you use on a daily basis can be one of the clunkiest parts of your day. You're typically having to juggle cables, trying to find the right port in the dark, or dealing with a charger that mysteriously stops working mid-charge. And it's super annoying. No one wants to put themselves through all that just to juice their phone back up to a full charge. And no one should have to. Not when multitasking chargers like this one are on offer.

See at Amazon

Get the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Charging Station for $83, down from its usual price of $110. That's $27 off and a discount of 25%.

This charging pad that can pull triple duty can help you charge your iPhone, Apple Watch, and Apple AirPods all at once without breaking a sweat. It's certified Q12 for quick charging and has a 15W built-in charger to keep everything effortlessly back at 100% when you need it. Plus, you don't have to buy a separate charger, because it comes with a 40W one that's already in the box! It also comes with a five-foot cable. That makes it a great value, especially compared to some of the more expensive options on the market that don't include those essentials. Unfortunately, that's been a thing for some time, but this charger makes it something you don't have to worry about.

And it's easy to use, too. The built-in magnets snap your phone into perfect alignment every time, which not only ensures faster charging but also prevents heat buildup and misalignment issues. Those things can slow you down and keep you from being able to charge your things up as easily. And with Anker's ActiveShield safety system monitoring temperatures thousands of times per day, you can charge with peace of mind. No having to wonder about whether something is going to burn up.

There's also a quality-of-life perk here that iPhone users will appreciate: the charger supports StandBy mode. That means when your phone is docked horizontally, it can turn into a mini smart display showing widgets, time, photos, or calendar updates. That's especially useful if you don't have an alarm clock. Hey, some of us decide not to. No one is judging you whatsoever.

For just $83, this is a no-brainer for anyone who has an Apple triple threat in their home. Be sure you grab yours before it's gone.

There's something to be said for just getting off your phone at the end of the day. Even if it is just being replaced by another screen, at least you're more likely to use that other screen to actually watch something, or maybe play a game, or even work. Just getting away from the ritualistic doom-scrolling so many of us end up caught in is a worthwhile cause. If you're after something to help out, then a tablet can be an excellent idea.

See at Amazon

If you're someone who wants the best things in life, then the tablet you should probably go for is the Apple iPad Air M3. This thing's an absolute beast of a tablet with enough power to keep you doing pretty much whatever you want. Better yet, it's currently $100 off, which is the lowest price on Amazon for a limited time.

It goes without saying that Apple makes some seriously incredible devices, and yet we've said it anyway, just in case you didn't know it goes without saying. But why? Well, with the M3 chip helping with processing, 128GB of storage, and a stunning 12 megapixel camera on it, this tablet can keep up with you no matter what. The M3 is literally built to help multitasking, and that means you can switch between apps and functions with no issues and no slowdown. That's essential when all you want to do is whatever you want, because nobody likes lag.

It can also manage some very pretty games, which is good news for those who want to relax at the end of the day while just chilling out in bed, but don't want to grab a handheld console. You can always pay for more storage if that's something you want too, as each model of this device is currently $100 off.

Of course, if you are someone in the Apple ecosystem already, this device will be even better for you. You'll get seamless integration with your phone and all of your favorite apps, which means you'll be able to stress even less when using it. It also works a treat if you invest in an Apple Pencil for more artsy affairs, or a Magic Keyboard if you want to get into some writing. The Apple iPad Air is an absolute beauty, and everything on it looks great thanks to the liquid retina display as well. So, make sure you don't skip this chance to save 17% on it, because it won't stick around for long.

The adventures of the Enterprise are coming to an end once more. With just over a month to go to the broadcast of its third season, Paramount has confirmed that Star Trek: Strange New Worlds will end with its fifth season.

The newly-confirmed fifth season will run for six episodes, down from Strange New Worlds‘ typical 10-episode seasons. No expected release window for the final season was confirmed, however the show's fourth season, already announced back in April 2024, is currently in production.

“From the very beginning, Strange New Worlds set out to honor what Star Trek has always stood for–boundless curiosity, hope and the belief that a better future is possible,” executive producers Akiva Goldsman, Henry Alonso Myers, and Alex Kurtzman said in a joint statement provided via press release. “We're deeply grateful to Paramount+ for the chance to complete our five-season mission, just as we envisioned it, alongside our extraordinary cast and crew. And to the passionate fans who've boldly joined us on this journey–THANK YOU. With three more spectacular seasons ahead for you to see and enjoy, this adventure is far from over.”

Strange New Worlds‘ conclusion follows a trend set in Star Trek‘s streaming renaissance by Discovery and Lower Decks before it, which also both ran for five seasons. But it also marks a turning point towards the end of that era: after the disastrous release of the Section 31 movie earlier this year, and the all-but-confirmed conclusion of Star Trek: Prodigy after its exodus to Netflix, with the confirmation of Strange New Worlds‘ end just one Star Trek series will remain active for now, the still-in-production Starfleet Academy (set in the 32nd century setting first explored in Discovery), which has already been renewed for a second season.

Star Trek‘s future beyond it may lie in future series, but the only close-to-certain projects we currently know of are films. A new film exploring the foundational years of Starfleet is currently in the works from director Toby Haynes, while Patrick Stewart has openly discussed plans for a potential return to the role of Jean-Luc Picard in a new film, presumably set after the conclusion of Star Trek: Picard.

Strange New Worlds returns for its third season on July 17, with a two-episode premiere. We'll bring you more on the future of Star Trek as and when we learn it.

Just days after initial reports of them not working.

The MIG Flash (formerly MIG-Switch) flash cart has been demonstrated to be compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2, backed by a small teaser from the team at X and the official listing explicitly stating: "Compatible with Switch 2". The company hasn't detailed how they got the flash cart working despite initial failures, but a firmware update is the likely enabler.

The MIG Flash was unveiled last year, serving as a flash cart that allows Nintendo Switch owners to play game backups from a microSD card. It effectively cosplays as an official Nintendo Switch game cartridge, tricking the console into recognizing and running dumped ROMs stored on the microSD card. Though intended for legitimate owners to easily maintain personal game backups, or for aspiring game developers hoping to make games for the Switch 2, the MIG Flash has, one way or another, found its way into the hands of pirates as well.

While the MIG Flash was initially deemed incompatible at launch, it now seemingly works with the Switch 2, suggesting the team has somehow cracked Nintendo's built-in protections for the new system. In a recent demo on X, they managed to boot The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, directly from the MIG Flash, though the load time was painfully slow. Better yet, the company now advertises the MIG Flash V2 to be compatible with the Switch 2 on their official website, touting a seamless experience: "Simply plug & play!"

pic.twitter.com/2pOZNgt1q9June 10, 2025

This was likely achieved through a firmware update, allowing it to circumvent new checks introduced by Nintendo for the Switch 2 that prevented it from booting or loading games previously. Still, don't expect it to run backups for Switch 2 games as dumping those ROMs is currently not possible, not to mention the illegality of such an act. There have been whispers of a userland exploit on the Switch 2, but its functionality and scope are extremely limited.

Let's address the elephant in the room. While the MIG Flash can theoretically enable pirates to play titles from the original Switch on Switch 2 hardware, it carries a very high risk of getting your console banned. Each Switch cartridge carries a unique identifier. Nintendo has sophisticated systems in place to detect if multiple consoles share the same cartridge ID and flag this as piracy, leading to an account ban, a console ban, or, at worst, a bricked console.

AirPods 4 are dominating Amazon this June and both Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) models and the non-ANC models of the new wireless earbuds are priced lowest ever. The non-ANC AirPods 4 currently cost $99 which is a price reduction from their initial price of $129. Meanwhile, ANC-packed high-end model with transparency mode and adaptive audio costs $148 compared to $179.

The two devices only differ in their feature sets, specifically how they handle noise: The standard AirPods 4 offer spatial audio tailored to the listener, more comfort and all the core features that make Apple's earbuds a success without active noise cancellation. The advanced version includes ANC, adaptive audio and transparency mode which makes it ideal for users who want to block noises. They are both based on the new H2 chip which powers improved sound quality and better call performance.

The quick-press controls on the stem allow you to naturally control music playback or take calls and the optical in-ear sensor stops sound from playing should the earbuds not be seated in your ears. Personalized spatial audio feature supported by dynamic head tracking immerses you in a movie-like listening environment.

Call and sound quality have significantly been improved by the H2 chip: Voice isolation tech limits background noise while calling and separates and cleans up your voice so that you can enjoy crystal-clear calls even in a packed space. The AirPods 4 also feature hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands and with Siri interactions having been upgraded lately, you are now able to answer Siri with a nod or shake of the head.

Battery life is also a major plus: One charge provides AirPods 4 with five hours of listening time, and with the charging case, you have a total of 30 hours of listening time. The case has been redesigned to be more than 10 percent smaller than previous cases which makes it even easier to carry. USB-C charging quicker and more convenient than eve, is supported on the case. For the ones who are concerned with how long they can last, the AirPods 4 and their case both have an IP54 rating for dust, sweat, and water resistance, so they'll withstand rain and intense exercise.

With Amazon's current sale, there's never been a better time to take advantage of all that the AirPods 4 has to offer.

Warp was founded in 2021 to help companies streamline their shipping supply chains and reduce costs through its tech-enabled network of shippers, carriers, and warehouses.

Now, it wants to make supply chains further efficient by using robots to automate its web of warehouses.

Daniel Sokolovsky, the co-founder and CEO of Warp, told TechCrunch that Warp is always looking for ways to make shipping more efficient for its customers, which include enterprises like Walmart, Gopuff, and HelloFresh. With the advancements in AI, the company thought there could be more opportunities to automate.

Warp can't automate the long-haul trucking or short-range delivery aspects of the supply chain, Sokolovsky said, so it's working on what it can potentially change: the workflows inside its warehouses.

Warp started by installing cameras into its test warehouse in Los Angeles and used computer vision to turn that data into a virtual warehouse to start experimenting.

“We effectively made a digital twin, or simulation environment for our LA facility,” Sokolovsky said. “[We] basically started just like throwing stuff at the wall. Honestly, a lot of it was, what happens if we do this? What happens if we do that? What happens if we do that other thing?”

One of their first ideas was to train humanoid robots to use traditional pallet jacks, which did not work. Then Warp started to find success using off-the-self robots with some additional tech retrofitted on.

“We've taken really, really complicated logistics problems, divided them into a lot of easily digestible, system-understood and system-fed components,” Sokolovsky said. “We are now using, whether it's AI in the form of voice, text, email, phone calls or robotics, [to make sure] that we're unloading, storing, and reloading freight. We actually think that we can actually continue this on, and really get to our goals as quickly as possible, without hiring more people.”

Troy Lester, Warp co-founder and CRO, said that these robots will help give Warp's underlying warehouse partners — other than its Los Angeles test facility, the company doesn't outright own the warehouses in its network — an edge, also helping to reduce labor costs.

“They're complaining to us about staffing issues all the time,” Lester said. “The labor that's doing the work in these facilities, they're not liking it either. So I think there is an opportunity to kind of empower those businesses to have these robotic kits that would not only help make our network better, but help make their business with other companies better as well.”

Warp raised a $10 million Series A round to help with this latest development. The round was co-led by Up.Partners and Blue Bear Capital.

Warp is testing several different versions of the robots and ambitiously claims it will start deploying this year.

Sokolovsky said Warp's Los Angeles test facility is totally autonomous, and the company plans to start deploying these robots to warehouses in its core networks — Los Angeles, Chicago, New Jersey, Dallas, and Miami — first. Warp doesn't plan on selling the tech outside of its hub — at least for now — because it gives Warp, and its underlying warehouse partners, a competitive advantage.

“Instead of going out and saying, hey, we're just a robot company, AI company, and spend money on like this potential concept, it's like, no, we're actually a logistics company that has been really impacting and servicing our customers,” Sokolovsky said. “For the past few years now, we've developed an amazing system and an ecosystem that's allowing us to deploy these kinds of automations.”

A central premise of robotaxis is that high usage and lower labor costs will ultimately make it a cheap transportation option. That is still far from true, but now there's some data that gives us an idea of by how much.

Obi, an app that aggregates real-time pricing and pick-up times across multiple ride-hailing services, has just published what it's calling the “first in-depth examination of Waymo's pricing strategy.” The company found Waymo's self-driving car rides to be consistently more expensive than comparative offerings from Uber and Lyft – and it doesn't seem to matter.

The report, shared exclusively with TechCrunch, is based on a month's worth of data collected between March 25 and April 25 in San Francisco, California. Obi pulled nearly 90,000 “offer records” from Waymo, Lyft's “standard” offering, and UberX in order to compare price and ETA. It then compared ride requests from the same times and routes. Obi found Lyft offered the lowest average price at $14.44. Uber was next at $15.58. Waymo's average price across the month's worth of data was $20.43.

Ashwini Anburajan, Obi's chief revenue officer, told TechCrunch this was somewhat surprising given the early popularity of Waymo's service. Waymo said in May it's providing 250,000 paid trips per week across its first four cities. Higher pricing has apparently not dimmed that excitement.

“Colloquially, there is an idea that autonomous vehicles are something that will erode driver jobs and put drivers at risk. And I think the irony of what we've seen is that it's actually quite expensive to run an AV, and that that's not going to be happening, at least in the near term,” she said. 

At peak hours, Obi found Waymo's average price to be about $11 more expensive than a Lyft and nearly $9.50 pricier than an Uber.

“I didn't expect consumers being willing to pay up to $10 more,” Anburajan said. “I think [that] speaks to a real sense of excitement for technology, novelty, and a real preference to sometimes be in the car without a driver.”

Obi found that not only was Waymo more expensive, but there was greater variability in its pricing than with Uber or Lyft.

Anburajan said one explanation is that Waymo's pricing model is not as sophisticated. Uber and Lyft, she said, have had more than a decade to refine how they price rides. Those platforms are also a bit more dynamic, with drivers clocking in and out on their own time, or joining or abandoning the gig work altogether. 

Waymo, meanwhile, has a mostly fixed but slowly growing supply of vehicles (though the pace of that growth may soon accelerate). This has led to what Anburajan said is more of a “pure supply and demand” pricing scheme.

That has two big impacts on customers. One is that short trips tend to cost more than longer ones. Obi found that Waymo rides cost roughly $26 per kilometer if the ride stays under 1.4 km. 

This was true of the Uber and Lyft rides, too. But Obi found the shortest Waymo rides were priced 41.48% and 31.12% higher than Uber and Lyft, respectively. That gap shrunk as the rides got longer. In rides lasting between 4.3 km and 9.3 km, a Lyft cost $2.60 per km, an Uber cost $2.90 per km, and a Waymo cost $3.50 per km. 

The other impact is that longer wait times equals more expensive trips. After all, sending a car a long way to pick up a customer means it will perform fewer high-margin, short-distance rides.

That still isn't discouraging Waymo customers, Anburajan said, even though Obi found Waymo to have a higher variability in wait times.

In addition to the data-based deep dive, Obi also surveyed riders in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix, Arizona to get a better understanding of what might be driving these trends.

The company found that 70% of users who had taken a Waymo ride said they preferred a driverless car to a traditional rideshare or taxi. 

Despite that enthusiasm, Obi found that safety is still a big concern for riders. Of those surveyed, 74% said safety is their biggest concern about robotaxis. Nearly 70% of respondents said they think there should be some form of remote human monitoring of the rides (something that is already a common practice).

Perhaps even more striking is how people answered a question about whether they would be willing to pay more for a Waymo. Nearly 40% said they'd pay “the same or less.” But 16.3% said they'd pay less than $5 more per ride. Another 10.1% said they'd pay up to $5 more per ride. And 16.3% said they'd pay up to $10 more per ride. 

Anburajan said responses like those help further explain Waymo's pricier rides. 

“There's something about being in the car alone” that is winning customers over, she said. “It is there for you to, like, kind of live in a little bubble and get from point A to point B, and be very comfortable doing so.”

Two European journalists were hacked using government spyware made by Israeli surveillance tech provider Paragon, new research has confirmed. 

On Thursday, digital rights group The Citizen Lab published a new report detailing the results of a new forensic investigation into the iPhones of Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino and an unnamed “prominent” European journalist. The researchers said both journalists were hacked by the same Paragon customer, based on evidence found on the two journalists' devices. 

Until now, there was no evidence that Pellegrino, who works for online news website Fanpage, had been either targeted or hacked with Paragon spyware. When he was alerted by Apple at the end of April, the notification referred to a mercenary spyware attack, but did not specifically mention Paragon, nor whether his phone had been infected with the spyware.

The confirmation of the first-ever known Paragon infections further deepens an ongoing spyware scandal that, for now, appears to be mostly focused on the use of spyware by the Italian government, but could expand to include other countries in Europe.

These new revelations come months after WhatsApp first notified around 90 of its users in over two dozen countries in Europe and beyond, including journalists, that they had been targeted with Paragon spyware, known as Graphite. Among those targeted were several Italians, including Pellegrino's colleague and Fanpage director Francesco Cancellato, as well as nonprofit workers who help rescue migrants at sea. 

Last week, Italy's parliamentary committee known as COPASIR, which oversees the country's intelligence agencies' activities, published a report that said it found no evidence that Cancellato was spied on. The report, which confirmed that Italy's internal and external intelligence agencies AISI and AISE were Paragon customers, made no mention of Pellegrino. 

The Citizen Lab's new report puts into question COPASIR's conclusions. 

“A week ago it seemed like Italy was putting this scandal to bed. Now they'll have to reckon with new forensic evidence,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, told TechCrunch ahead of the report's publication. “Ciro's case adds to the big and politically tricky question: Who has been hacking Italian journalists with Paragon spyware? This mystery needs an answer.”

Scott-Railton said The Citizen Lab believes that the Italian government is in a position to definitively answer questions about what was done with their use of Paragon spyware, particularly regarding Ciro's case.

Pellegrino told TechCrunch that he believes that his civil rights have been “trampled upon.” 

“I understand that Prime Minister Meloni is a professional journalist like me (I have been a journalist since 2005, she has since 2006),” Pellegrino told TechCrunch. “Does she care about the rights of this type of workers? Why has she not spent a single word in solidarity with the journalists who have been spied on?”

After Cancellato revealed he had been targeted with spyware, the Italian government published a press release denying it was behind the targeting of any journalist or human rights activists. 

The fact that both Cancellato and Pellegrino work for the same outlet suggests they may be part of a “cluster” of targets, according to the Citizen Lab report. 

Pellegrino said that he did not work on the blockbuster Fanpage investigation into the “Gioventù Meloniana,” a group part of Meloni's Fratelli d'Italia party, which revealed that some of its members sympathize with fascism. Pellegrino, who is the head of Fanpage's Naples bureau, also said he hasn't worked on any investigation about immigration. 

“It is possible that someone was hoping to gain information about Fanpage by hacking my smartphone,” said Pellegrino. 

The Italian government did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment. 

A spokesperson for COPASIR referred TechCrunch to the report it published last week and in particular to a section of it that said that the committee “reserves the right to conduct further investigations including after the publication of this report,” including “the alleged mobile device intrusions disclosed by two other journalists in recent weeks.” 

Apart from Pellegrino, another journalist in Italy, Monica Macchioni, said in early May that she had received a notification from Apple. It's likely that COPASIR is referring to her as the second journalist.

Referring to an email TechCrunch sent to Paragon and its executive chairman John Fleming, Emily Horne, who works for WestExec Advisors, said the spyware maker “won't have anything new on this,” apart from what the company said earlier this week. At the time, Paragon told Israeli newspaper Haaretz that it offered the Italian government help to investigate Cancellato's alleged hack, but the government refused — and that's why the company cut ties with Italy. 

On April 29, 2025, the prominent European journalist received a notification from Apple, the same notification that Pellegrino received and on the same day, according to The Citizen Lab. The lab's researchers analyzed the unnamed journalist's devices and found that one of them was infected with Graphite, based on forensic evidence showing that the spyware communicated with a server that the researchers had previously established with “high confidence” was part of Paragon's infrastructure. 

Citizen Lab said the journalist was hacked with “a sophisticated zero-click attack against the device via iMessage,” based on the researchers finding a specific iMessage account “present in the device logs around the same time as the phone was communicating with the Paragon server.” 

Zero-click hacks are some of the most effective attacks, given that, as the name suggests, they require no interaction from the target. And in this case, The Citizen Lab said it believed the attack was invisible to the victim. 

According to the report, Apple told The Citizen Lab that “the attack deployed in these cases was mitigated in iOS 18.3.1,” which was released on February 10, 2025, some two weeks after WhatsApp notified the targets of Paragon spyware.

Apple did not respond to TechCrunch's request for comment prior to publication. 

In the case of Pellegrino, The Citizen Lab said it found the same iMessage account on his iPhone's logs. Given that it's typical for each government customer to have its own spyware infrastructure, The Citizen Lab said it believed Pellegrino and the unnamed journalist were likely targeted by the same Paragon operator. 

The unnamed journalist's iPhone was infected in January and early February, said The Citizen Lab. 

According to COPASIR's report, Paragon and its Italian intelligence customers suspended the company's surveillance systems on February 14, 2025, which means that the spy agencies AISE and AISI were still using Paragon's spyware when the prominent European journalist was hacked.  

For now, The Citizen Lab has not attributed Pellegrino's and the other unnamed European journalist's hacks to any government. 

The Citizen Lab noted in the report that it's possible some of the people who were notified of having been targeted with Graphite by WhatsApp may also have been infected, but, due to the fact that Android has limited logs, as well as “efforts by Paragon to delete traces of the infection,” it may be impossible to confirm that. 

Apart from Pellegrino and the unnamed journalists, two other people have so far been confirmed to have been targeted with Paragon's spyware: Luca Casarini and Beppe Caccia, who both work for the Italian nonprofit Mediterranea Saving Humans, which rescues immigrants who try to cross the Mediterranean Sea. The Citizen Lab confirmed both were infected after analyzing their devices. In its report, COPASIR confirmed the two were surveilled by Italian spy agencies.

There are other people who have said they received notifications of having been targeted. Their cases, however, are still somewhat unclear. 

David Yambio, a Sudanese citizen and president and co-founder of Refugees in Libya, a nonprofit organization active in Italy that works on immigration issues, received a notification from Apple. After analyzing his device, The Citizen Lab said it found traces of a spyware infection, but could not link the compromise to a particular spyware maker nor any government. 

COPASIR said Yambio was lawfully targeted by Italian intelligence agencies, but not with Graphite. COPASIR added that Yambio was under surveillance by the country's judicial authorities for a criminal investigation. Yambio's phone was registered to Mattia Ferrari, a priest who collaborates with Mediterranea. 

Ferrari also received the spyware notification from WhatsApp. COPASIR, however, said it found no evidence he was targeted with Graphite. 

Scott-Railton said that The Citizen Lab forensic and technical analyses are ongoing on all cases, including Cancellato.

Updated on Thursday with a response from COPASIR, and to clarify the second journalist the committee was likely referring to.

QiMeng is a new open-source project for full-stack chip design. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


China's leading scientific institution has taken the wraps off QiMeng, an AI-powered system designed to accelerate chip design. The new open-source project from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) uses LLMs for “fully automated hardware and software design,” and can be used to design “entire CPUs.” But sample chips, so far, seem rather puny.

QiMeng means ‘enlightenment,' according to an SCMP report on its unveiling. As of now, two processors have been created using QiMeng: QiMeng-CPU-v1, which is comparable to an Intel 486; and QiMeng-CPU-v2, which is claimed to rival an Arm Cortex A53. At the time of writing, CAS's link to the QiMeng-CPU-v2 project details is broken.

Despite our snark about the first design being i486 (1989) level, there's a significant advance from v1 to v2 if the newest sample reaches A53 (2012) capabilities. That's a 23-year leap…

We have previously written about the latest innovations in AI chip design software from Western companies like Cadence and Synopsys. Both these big names in the EDA field have widely adopted AI. Cadence, for example, has delivered multiple AI platforms across the key steps of design and verification. Meanwhile, we know that Synopsys DSO.ai has assisted with over 200 taped-out chip designs, at the latest count.

However, the appeal of QiMeng, at least as far as we can tell from this early PR, is that it could be a bold industry disruptor with wider applications. The SCMP notes that this open-source effort has three key interconnected layers melding LLM chip design smarts, a hardware and software design agent, and various chip design apps. During tests, it is claimed that QiMeng can do in days what takes human teams weeks to achieve.

QiMeng has come into view in the shadow of U.S. pressure on technology sanctions in general. However, it seems even more timely in the context of the more recent moves by the US Commerce Department with regard to export controls on software. Earlier this month, we reported that China tech giants like Lenovo and Xiaomi were reeling after Washington cracked down on software license availability from the likes of Cadence and Synopsys.

As noted by the CAS researchers, China must react, as chip design tech is “a strategically vital industry.” We await QiMeng-CPU-v3 with great interest, but aren't expecting another 23-year leap in the technology stakes – that would be 2035 technology.

On Wednesday, acting FAA administrator Chris Rocheleau told the House Appropriations Committee that the Federal Aviation Administration plans to replace its aging air traffic control systems, which still rely on floppy disks and Windows 95 computers, Tom's Hardware reports. The agency has issued a Request for Information to gather proposals from companies willing to tackle the massive infrastructure overhaul.

“The whole idea is to replace the system. No more floppy disks or paper strips,” Rocheleau said during the committee hearing. US transportation secretary Sean Duffy called the project “the most important infrastructure project that we've had in this country for decades,” describing it as a bipartisan priority.

Most air traffic control towers and facilities across the US currently operate with technology that seems frozen in the 20th century, although that isn't necessarily a bad thing—when it works. Some controllers currently use paper strips to track aircraft movements and transfer data between systems using floppy disks, while their computers run Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system, which launched in 1995.

As Tom's Hardware notes, modernization of the system is broadly popular. Sheldon Jacobson, a University of Illinois professor who has studied risks in aviation, says that the system works remarkably well as is but that an upgrade is still critical, according to NPR. The aviation industry coalition Modern Skies has been pushing for ATC modernization and recently released an advertisement highlighting the outdated technology.

While the vintage systems may have inadvertently protected air traffic control from widespread outages like the CrowdStrike incident that disrupted modern computer systems globally in 2024, agency officials say 51 of the FAA's 138 systems are unsustainable due to outdated functionality and a lack of spare parts.

The FAA isn't alone in clinging to floppy disk technology. San Francisco's train control system still runs on DOS loaded from 5.25-inch floppy disks, with upgrades not expected until 2030 due to budget constraints. Japan has also struggled in recent years to modernize government record systems that use floppy disks.

Modernizing the air traffic control system presents engineering challenges that extend far beyond simply installing newer computers. Unlike typical IT upgrades, ATC systems must maintain continuous 24/7 operation, because shutting down facilities for maintenance could compromise aviation safety.

This uptime requirement eliminates the possibility of traditional system replacement approaches where old hardware gets swapped out during scheduled downtime. The replacement systems must also meet security requirements to resist cyberattacks. A successful breach of air traffic control infrastructure could paralyze national aviation networks, resulting in cascading effects that impact transportation, commerce, and emergency services.

And yet not everyone is convinced the planned massive overhaul will achieve the desired effects. In an NPR report on the issue, aviation industry analyst Robert W. Mann Jr. expressed skepticism about whether new systems will actually materialize.

“This has been the same mantra for the past 30 years. Give them more money. They'll build the new system. It'll work better, work harder,” Mann told NPR. “And we've been doing that for well over 30 years now, and we've gotten the same results.”

Still, recent failures have confirmed some vulnerabilities in the aging system. A January 2023 outage in the FAA's Notice to Airmen system forced the grounding of every flight nationwide for more than two hours. Experts blamed the failure on aging infrastructure and damaged database files, with sources telling CNN at the time that budget constraints had repeatedly delayed needed tech refreshes. More recently, radar and communication outages led to hundreds of delays and cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport, with a wiring failure being cited as one cause.

The US Transportation Department has set a four-year timeline for completing the modernization project, though industry experts question whether this schedule is realistic given the scope and complexity involved. According to the NPR report, Jacobson thinks the administration's announced timeline is “wildly optimistic,” especially given the absence of a price tag for the sweeping plan.

The FAA has announced several “Industry Days” where companies can present their technologies and proposals to department officials. The White House has not yet disclosed the expected cost of the modernization effort. Despite the financial uncertainty, Duffy emphasized the perceived urgency of the project: “Everyone agrees—this is nonpartisan. Everyone knows we have to do it.”

No, your high-end system is not enough to play this game.

Third-person action-adventure title MindsEye had a disastrous launch after many day-one players complained of performance issues despite driving top-of-the-line equipment. One creator shared on X (formerly Twitter) that they have an average frames per second (fps) of just 55, despite running an RTX 5090 paired with an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and 64GB of DDR5. The screenshot shows the game's 98% GPU usage and gobbles up 19GB of VRAM. It comes after the game was universally panned on launch for its unfinished state, with players reporting wild glitches and strange NPC behavior.

One player running a more modest system—an RX 9070 XT GPU matched to a 9800X3D processor—tried the game set to the lowest possible quality. They were able to achieve a more respectable 84 fps, but they had atrocious 21 fps 1% lows and 16 fps 0.1% lows.

This shot perfectly encapsulates the state of MindsEye performance. Sub 60fps on a 5090, in a game that does not even use hardware Lumen, as far as I know. Also, over 19GB of VRAM, for whatever reason. pic.twitter.com/3orSj1WnhiJune 11, 2025

These absolutely horrendous numbers make the game quite unplayable on most gaming PCs, and it's quite reminiscent of Cyberpunk 2077, which ran into the same problems when it launched five years ago. One might argue that the developers would've warned the players about the hardware requirements for MindsEye, but the Steam page says otherwise.

The game's minimum requirements are an Intel Core i5-12400F or an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X matched to a GPU with 6GB of VRAM, like RTX 2060 or RX 5600 XT, and 16GB of RAM. If you want a better experience, its recommended specifications are an Intel Core i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D with an 8 GB VRAM GPU like the RTX 4070 or RX 6800 XT. However, the samples we've seen show that these specifications are largely unable to run the game at good quality with acceptable fps numbers.

Here's MINDSEYE Performance at the lowest possible settings, 1% Lows and 0.1% are absolutely atrocious.I do not recommend playing this Game on PC pic.twitter.com/m4iqACTmvVJune 10, 2025

GameGPU.com tested the game at maximum quality and no upscaling across different GPUs with a 9800X3D CPU, and the results showed that you need at least an RX9070 with 16 GB of VRAM to hit more than 60 fps at 1920 x 1080 resolution. If you want to play at 1440p, only the RTX 4090 24 GB and RTX 5090 32 GB can go above that number, while no GPU achieves more than 60 fps at 4K resolution.

The suggested minimum and recommended GPUs for the game aren't even listed in the test, as they only have 6 GB or 8GB of VRAM, whereas the least powerful tested GPU was the RTX 2080 Ti, which has 11GB of VRAM. Despite being locked to 30 fps, console players are also reportedly experiencing stutter issues.

Thankfully, the developers have already released a statement on Steam acknowledging the issue and said that they're working on a hotfix for the game. “Improving performance across all devices is our immediate focus,” the team said. “A patch that begins our commitment to address this is scheduled for the end of this week on PC, which will also roll out to consoles as soon as possible.”

This is a comforting thought for the players who have invested at least $60 to buy the game, only to find it unplayable on their systems. Hopefully, the team irons out these kinks and gets the game playing as smoothly as possible on the greatest number of systems.

PCIe 6.0 interoperability tests are planned for later this year.

PCI-SIG, which oversees the development of the PCIe specification, announced on Wednesday that it had finalized the PCIe 7.0 spec and passed it to members of the organization, marking a significant milestone in the technology's development. Separately, the company said that it had begun pathfinding for PCIe 8.0, a specification for interconnections that will be used sometime in 2030 or beyond, which may double the performance of PCIe 7.0 and deliver bandwidth of 1 TB/s over 16 lanes in two directions. In addition, the company reiterated plans to start interoperability tests for PCIe 6.0 hardware later this year.



While PCIe 8.0 is still years away, PCIe 7.0 is a lot closer. The PCIe 7.0 specification increases the per-lane data transfer rate to 128 GT/s in each direction, which is twice as fast as PCIe 6.0 supports and four times faster than PCIe 5.0. Such a significant performance increase enables devices with 16 PCIe 7.0 lanes to transfer up to 256 GB/s in each direction, not accounting for protocol overhead. The new version of the interface continues to use PAM4 signaling while maintaining the 1b/1b FLIT encoding method first introduced in PCIe 6.0.



To achieve PCIe 7.0's 128 GT/s record data transfer rate, developers of PCIe 7.0 had to increase the physical signaling rate to 32 GHz or beyond. Keep in mind that both PCIe 5.0 and 6.0 use a physical signaling rate of 16 GHz to enable 32 GT/s using NRZ signaling and 64 GT/s using PAM4 signaling (which allows transfers of two bits per symbol). With PCIe 7.0, developers had to boost the physical frequency for the first time since 2017, which required tremendous work at various levels, as maintaining signal integrity at 32 GHz over long distances using copper wires is extremely challenging.

Beyond raw throughput, the update also offers improved power efficiency and stronger support for longer or more complex electrical channels, particularly when using a cabling solution, to cater to the needs of next-generation data center-grade bandwidth-hungry applications, such as 800G Ethernet, Ultra Ethernet, and quantum computing, among others.



Arguably, the most interesting announcement made today by PCI-SIG is a statement that pathfinding for PCIe 8.0 is underway, and members of the organization are actively exploring possibilities and defining capabilities of a standard that they are going to use in 2030 and beyond. Interestingly, when asked whether PCIe 8.0 would double data transfer rate to 256 GT/s in each direction (and therefore enable bandwidth of 1 TB/s in both directions using 16 lanes), Al Yanes, president of PCI-SIG, said that while this is an intention, he would not like to make any definitive claims. Additionally, he stated that PCI-SIG is looking forward to enabling PCIe 8.0, which will offer higher performance over copper wires in addition to optical interconnects.

" We are hoping [to double performance], but I do not want to make any definitive claims at the moment, but that is our, that is our hope," said Yanes at a press conference. "We do not think optical is going to be the only way. So we are hoping and thinking that we can do electrical, but we do not have a clear answer there. The pathfinding has just started. So, give us a little bit of time to resolve that. But we believe we can do electrical. We do not think it is just going to be optical."



With the PCIe 7.0 standard officially released, members of the PCI-SIG, including AMD, Intel, and Nvidia, can begin finalizing the development of their platforms that support the PCIe specifications. PCI-SIG plans to start preliminary compliance tests in 2027, with official interoperability tests scheduled for 2028. Therefore, expect actual PCIe 7.0 devices and platforms on the market sometime in 2028 – 2029, if everything goes as planned.

In addition to disclosing milestones for PCIe 7.0, PCI-SIG also re-emphasized plans to officially start Integrators List compliance testing of PCIe 6.0 hardware in 2025, about a year later than expected. Speaking of PCIe Gen6 at large, it is necessary to note that the PCIe 6.4 specification now defines industry-standard ways to use optical technologies between PCIe 6.4 and PCIe 7.0-compliant devices. However, interoperability tests for optical PCIe interconnections are set to start later.

Meta has sued the maker of a popular AI “nudify” app, Crush AI, that reportedly ran thousands of ads across Meta's platforms. In addition to the lawsuit, Meta says it's taking new measures to crack down on other apps like Crush AI.

In a lawsuit filed in Hong Kong, Meta alleged Joy Timeline HK, the entity behind Crush AI, attempted to circumvent the company's review process to distribute ads for AI nudify services. Meta said in a blog post that it repeatedly removed ads by the entity for violating its policies but claims Joy Timeline HK continued to place additional ads anyway.

Crush AI, which uses generative AI to make fake, sexually explicit images of real people without their consent, reportedly ran more than 8,000 ads for its “AI undresser” services on Meta's platform in the first two weeks of 2025, according to the author of the Faked Up newsletter, Alexios Mantzarlis. In a January report, Mantzarlis claimed that Crush AI's websites received roughly 90% of their traffic from either Facebook or Instagram, and that he flagged several of these websites to Meta.

Crush AI reportedly evaded Meta's ad review processes by setting up dozens of advertiser accounts and frequently changed domain names. Many of Crush AI's advertiser accounts, according to Mantzarlis, were named “Eraser Annyone's Clothes” followed by different numbers. At one point, Crush AI even had a Facebook page promoting its service.

Facebook and Instagram are hardly the only platforms dealing with such challenges. As social media companies like X and Meta race to add generative AI to their apps, they've also struggled to moderate how AI tools can make their platforms unsafe for users, particularly minors.

Researchers have found that links to AI undressing apps soared in 2024 on platforms like X and Reddit, and on YouTube, millions of people were reportedly served ads for such apps. In response to this growing problem, Meta and TikTok have banned keyword searches for AI nudify apps, but getting these services off their platforms entirely has proven challenging.

In a blog post, Meta said it has developed new technology to specifically identify ads for AI nudify or undressing services “even when the ads themselves don't include nudity.” The company said it is now using matching technology to help find and remove copycat ads more quickly and has expanded the list of terms, phrases, and emoji that are flagged by its systems.

Meta said it is also applying the tactics it has traditionally used to disrupt networks of bad actors to these new networks of accounts running ads for AI nudify services. Since the start of 2025, Meta said, it has disrupted four separate networks promoting these services.

Outside of its apps, the company said it will begin sharing information about AI nudify apps through Tech Coalition's Lantern program, a collective effort between Google, Meta, Snap, and other companies to prevent child sexual exploitation online. Meta says it has provided more than 3,800 unique URLs with this network since March.

On the legislative front, Meta said it would “continue to support legislation that empowers parents to oversee and approve their teens' app downloads.” The company previously supported the US Take It Down Act and said it's now working with lawmakers to implement it.

Spanish startup Multiverse Computing on Thursday said it has raised an enormous Series B round of €189 million (about $215 million) on the strength of a technology it calls “CompactifAI.”

CompactifAI is a quantum computing-inspired compression technology that is capable of reducing the size of LLMs by up to 95% without impacting model performance, the company said.

Specifically, Multiverse offers compressed versions of well-known, open source LLMs — primarily small models — such as Llama 4 Scout, Llama 3.3 70B, Llama 3.1 8B, and Mistral Small 3.1. The company plans to release a version of DeepSeek R1 soon and said it is working on more open source and reasoning models. Proprietary models from OpenAI and others are not supported.

Its “slim” models, as the company calls them, are available via Amazon Web Services or can be licensed for on-premise usage. The company says its models are 4x to 12x faster than comparable not-compressed versions, which translates to a 50% to 80% reduction in inference costs. For instance, Multiverse says its Llama 4 Scout Slim costs 10 cents per million tokens on AWS compared to Llama 4 Scout's 14 cents.

Multiverse claims some of its models can be made so small and energy efficient that they can be run on PCs, phones, cars, drones, and even the DIY-enthusiast's favorite tiny PC, Raspberry Pi. (We are suddenly imagining those fantastical Raspberry Pi Christmas-light houses upgraded with LLM-powered interactive talking Santas.)

Multiverse has some technical might behind it. It was co-founded by its CTO Román Orús, a professor at the Donostia International Physics Center in San Sebastián, Spain. Orús is known for his pioneering work on tensor networks (not to be confused with all the AI-related projects named Tensor at Google). 

Tensor networks are computational tools that mimic quantum computers but run on normal computers. One of their primary uses these days is compression of deep learning models.

Multiverse's other co-founder, CEO Enrique Lizaso Olmos, also holds multiple mathematical degrees and has been a college professor. He spent most of his career in banking and is best known as the former deputy CEO of Unnim Banc. 

The Series B was led by Bullhound Capital, which has backed companies like Spotify, Revolut, Delivery Hero, Avito, and Discord. HP Tech Ventures, SETT, Forgepoint Capital International, CDP Venture Capital, Santander Climate VC, Toshiba, and Capital Riesgo de Euskadi — Grupo SPR also participated in the round.

Multiverse says it has 160 patents and 100 customers globally, including Iberdrola, Bosch, and the Bank of Canada. With this funding, it has raised about $250 million to date.

The surviving patches are small: 10's of meters on a side.  The title language and figures cited make it appear this was a large scale farm operation.  Instead, it looks like a collection of household farms scattered around the bottomland.And while this is the UP of Michigan, it's actually at the southern-most point of the UP, right on the 45th parallel.  It's not Florida, but it's also not exactly the Arctic either: the growing season is months shorter, but it does exist, there is ample precipitation, and the soil is often excellent.  There are many farms operating at this latitude and further north today, although not much further north.

Historically, every major technological leap has enabled more, not less: more experimentation, more products, more services, and more jobs. When electricity, the steam engine, or the internet were adopted, the boldest companies didn't shrink their ambitions. They expanded aggressively, took risks, and created entirely new markets. So why is AI being treated differently?One reason seems to be risk aversion. Many companies, especially large and established ones, are focused on short-term gains, shareholder expectations, and operational efficiency. They see AI as a way to "optimize" — to cut staff, automate workflows, and increase margins — instead of using it as a foundation for new lines of business or transformative innovation.But this is a shallow use of a deep technology.Imagine instead a company using AI not to downsize teams, but to multiply their output. They could afford to hire more people, putting more creative minds to work, while AI acts as an accelerator — automating repetitive tasks, generating prototypes, coordinating agents, and simulating large-scale systems. This opens the door to projects that previously seemed too complex or costly: personalized education platforms, open-ended scientific research, AI-driven drug discovery, sustainable agriculture systems, or highly efficient digital public services.Yes, these kinds of projects are risky. But they also offer disproportionate rewards, both financially and socially. Companies that bet on bold, transformative uses of AI — instead of simply optimizing existing processes — are the ones that will shape the future, just as Google did with search or SpaceX with aerospace.Ironically, AI can also reduce the cost of failure. It allows for faster prototyping, quicker insights, and tighter feedback loops. This makes bold experimentation more feasible than ever.The real obstacle is not the technology, but a lack of vision and courage. Playing it safe with AI might improve short-term profits, but it limits long-term growth and impact. Companies that adopt a more ambitious mindset, and treat AI as a collaborator rather than a replacement, have the chance to redefine what is possible.So the question shouldn't be, "How many people can we replace with AI?"
It should be, "What are the things we've never dared to try that AI now makes achievable?"

Replacing human labor with machine labor is essentially what automation is. Look what happened to telephone operators and bank tellers on one end (replaced by machines like automated switching systems and ATMs) and clerical workers and cashiers on another (replaced by tools like office software and self-checkout systems.)The sales pitch to businesses is, and continues to be, saving money by replacing paid humans with unpaid machines.I don't think that AI changes the fundamental trajectory of automation, or its tendency (over the past few decades at least) to widen income disparity as displaced workers move to lower-paying service jobs that aren't yet automated, but it may have much wider impact than previous automation waves.

I really wonder how all this AI stuff feels/seems to a management person who is not a programmer/low-level-minded person. I remember the time when large portion of average workers could barely understand how to "use computer", let alone the wonder of some simple Excel-VBA/Python magic, and as of now, humanlike magical text prompts. Now after decade(s), some of these persons are in a management position dealing with "AI".

Having machines do the goods and services production while humans are free to pursue whatever they wish (with a basic income of-course) IS world changing.

The risk aversion isn't driven by business needs, but by the needs of the employees and unless you are a founder with a majority of voting shares, you are an employee. Some of the more risk tolerant people might do it for their sliver of equity, but many will not.For example, one of my jobs (I am overemployed) is as a dev for a small startup that first tried to outsource development and then had to hire devs in house as that was a disaster. We have a certain amount of runway. Project is pretty chaotic. Customers are bailing as we cannot meet our commitments.I would argue rational management would push hard to fix things quickly and spend the money to do so even if it meant raising money sooner, as key customers are fleeing, our reputation is mediocre, and stability is nowhere close. As an employee, I am fighting hard for a controlled flight into the ground to drag out how long the paychecks for this mess keep flowing.Why?As an employee, I have no meaningful upside unless my options suddenly get valuable and I long ago learned that you can be laid off with limited recourse, so I value equity at zero. My interests are entirely in prolonging my employment so the cash keeps flowing.I will take the 100% certain death of my employer over 3 years rather than a 50/50 chance of success as a business.Same thing with managers and AI. Better to take the certain win as if you are an employee, it isn't as though you definitely gain from the company gaining.

I would argue rational management would push hard to fix things quickly and spend the money to do so even if it meant raising money sooner, as key customers are fleeing, our reputation is mediocre, and stability is nowhere close.

Even startups are beholden to the VCs that funded them. Unless the founder is a multi-millionaire and willing to risk it all, risk aversion will become a factor.

Researchers have developed an innovative new nanopore sequencing assay to identify carriers of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading cause of monogenic autism spectrum disorder and inherited intellectual disabilities. The study in The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics, published by Elsevier, addresses the urgent need for a screening tool to identify carriers of FXS in a more comprehensive, faster, efficient, and cost-effective way compared to current methods, for better informed genetic counseling.

FXS affects approximately 1 in 7000 females and 1 in 4000 males worldwide. Common characteristics include mild to severe intellectual disability, developmental delays in speech and motor skills, behavioral and social issues such as ADHD-like and autism spectrum disorder symptoms, sensory sensitivities, and sometimes characteristic physical features.

Lead investigator Qiwei Guo, PhD, Department of Central Laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fujian Key Clinical Specialty of Laboratory Medicine, Women and Children's Hospital, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, says, "Although FXS carrier prevalence is high, with all major ethnic groups and races being susceptible to FXS, widespread FXS carrier screening for the general population has remained debatable. Based on previous research, clinical interest has shifted from 'whether to perform' to 'how to perform' population-based FXS carrier screening. However, an accurate, fast, affordable, and effective carrier screening assay that can examine a large number of female samples was still lacking. In this study, we developed a reliable and user-friendly software to analyze sequencing data and report results."

The gene responsible for FXS is fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein1 (FMR1), an X-linked dominant gene with full penetrance in all males and many females. It plays a crucial role in synapse formation and normal dendrite development. The number of CGG repeats, a specific sequence of DNA building blocks, is a key indicator of whether someone has a normal FMR1 gene, carries a premutation, or has the full mutation that causes FXS.

Co-investigator Yulin Zhou, PhD, Department of Central Laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fujian Key Clinical Specialty of Laboratory Medicine, Women and Children's Hospital, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, explains, "We demonstrated that the nanopore sequencing assay can accurately identify the full range of premutation FMR1 alleles, which account for the majority of FXS carriers, and the nanopore sequencing assay was able to reliably quantify CGG repeats and AGG interruptions, two specific DNA sequence variations that are critical for determining the risk of full mutation expansion in carriers, thus facilitating genetic counseling for carrier screening."

By utilizing identifier sequences, the researchers were able to test multiple samples in a single assay, dramatically increasing test capacity and reducing costs. The nanopore sequencing assay can be accomplished within a short turnaround time (approximately two days for an assay testing 100 simultaneously) by a technician in a standard molecular diagnostics laboratory. Compared to other commonly used techniques, the equipment for nanopore sequencing assays is more accessible and portable, and thus could be more readily and widely adapted, particularly in underdeveloped regions of the world.

Dr. Guo concludes, "We focus on controlling human genetic diseases and reducing birth defects. Given the significant morbidity associated with FXS and the lack of effective treatments, prenatal diagnosis and intervention are warranted. Our findings demonstrate that this novel nanopore sequencing assay overcomes key limitations of existing methods for FXS carrier screening, ultimately paving the way for enhanced genetic counseling and broader implementation worldwide."

Cuts to Medicaid and other federal health programs proposed in President Donald Trump's budget plan would rapidly push more than 300 financially struggling rural hospitals toward a fiscal cliff, according to researchers who track the facilities' finances.

The hospitals would be at a disproportionate risk of closure, service reductions, or ending inpatient care, according to a report authored by experts from the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research following a request from Senate Democrats, who released the findings publicly Thursday. Many of those hospitals are in Kentucky, Louisiana, California, and Oklahoma, according to the analysis.

Trump's budget plan, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” contains nearly $700 billion in Medicaid cuts, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. House Republicans passed the bill in late May, and it now awaits Senate consideration.

The proposed cuts to Medicaid raise the stakes for rural hospitals nationwide, many of which already operate on razor-thin, if not negative, margins. Diminished reimbursements from the state-federal health insurance program for those with low incomes or disabilities would further erode hospitals' ability to stay open and maintain services for their communities — populations with more severe health needs than their urban counterparts.

"It's very clear that Medicaid cuts will result in rural hospital closures," said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association, a nonprofit advocacy and research organization.

The Senate Democrats sent a letter to Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and House Speaker Mike Johnson asking them to reconsider the Medicaid cuts.

Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), one of the Senate Democrats who requested the information from Sheps, in a statement said communities should know exactly what they stand to lose if Congress approves the reductions to Medicaid.

"People will die" if rural hospitals close, he said. "No life or job is worth a yes vote on this big billionaire bill."

Hospitals that do stay afloat likely will do so by cutting services that are particularly dependent on Medicaid reimbursements, such as labor and delivery units, mental health care, and emergency rooms. Obstetric services are among the most expensive and are being eliminated by a growing number of rural hospitals, expanding the areas that lack nearby maternity or labor and delivery care. Iowa, Texas, and Minnesota had the most rural obstetrics service closures between 2011 and 2023, according to the health analytics and consulting firm Chartis, which also studies rural hospital finances.

Nearly half of rural hospitals are operating in the red and 432 are vulnerable to closure. Medicaid cuts would push them further into financial peril.

That vulnerability stems at least partly from rural Americans' being more likely to depend on Medicaid than the general population. For instance, nearly 50% of rural births are covered by the program, compared with 41% of births overall. But Medicaid covers only about half of what private insurance reimburses for childbirth-related services. Rural health systems have been struggling to meet the needs of their communities without the cuts to Medicaid, which brings in $12.2 billion, or nearly 10% of rural hospital net revenue, according to a Chartis report from May.

Hospitals in rural areas would collectively lose more than $1.8 billion with a 15% cut to Medicaid. That loss in revenue is roughly equivalent to 21,000 full-time hospital employees' salaries.

Rural hospitals' margins have been deteriorating for 10 to 15 years, said Michael Topchik, executive director for the Chartis Center for Rural Health, which analyzes and consults on rural hospital finances. Ten years ago, about one-third of rural hospitals were operating in the red. That's closer to 50% now, he said.

It's even higher in the 10 states that did not expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, with 53% of rural hospitals there already operating in the red and more than 200 vulnerable to closure.

Other policies continue to affect rural hospitals, according to Chartis. Facilities will lose $509 million this year due to a 2% Medicare reimbursement cut — what's known as sequestration — and $159 million in reimbursement for bad debt and charity care combined.

Some rural hospitals have responded to the increasing financial pressures in recent years by joining larger networks, such as Intermountain Health or Sanford, which are connected to facilities in the Mountain West and Midwest. But about half of rural hospitals are still independent, Topchik said, and struggle with a perennial collision of low patient volume and high fixed costs.

"We can't Henry Ford our way out of this by increasing volumes to dilute costs and reduce prices," he said. "It's expensive, and that's the reason the federal government, for a long time, has reimbursed rural hospitals in a variety of manners to help keep them whole."

Rural hospitals play an important role in their communities. They provide health care to Americans who are older, sicker, and poorer and have less access overall to providers compared with people who live in urban areas. In many cases, a local rural hospital is the largest employer in a community and can trigger substantial local economic declines if it closes.

"When you close a hospital, oftentimes, the community follows," Morgan said.

More than 10 million Americans enrolled in Medicaid live in counties that have at least one rural hospital, according to Chartis estimates. Kentucky, Texas, New York, North Carolina, California, and Michigan have the largest estimated populations of rural Medicaid enrollees.

And while Utah is not a state identified as especially vulnerable, health leaders there are concerned about rural hospital closures if Medicaid funding is cut, said Matt McCullough, the rural hospital improvement director for the Utah Hospital Association.

Facilities in rural parts of Utah are often governed by a board made up of community members — farmers, ranchers, and business owners who care about keeping their hospitals open, McCullough said, because they were born there and their kids were born there.

"They'll do anything to see it stay open and provide good quality care to their neighbors, family members," he said. "It's people that they know and care about."

CRISPR-Cas13, a powerful RNA-targeting technology is gaining increasing attention as a next-generation gene therapy platform due to its precision and reduced side effects. Utilizing this system, researchers at KAIST have now developed the world's first technology capable of selectively acetylating (chemically modifying) specific RNA molecules among countless transcripts within living cells. This breakthrough enables precise, programmable control of RNA function and is expected to open new avenues in RNA-based therapeutic development.

KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced that a research team led by Professor Won Do Heo in the Department of Biological Sciences has recently developed a groundbreaking technology capable of selectively acetylating specific RNA molecules within the human body using the CRISPR-Cas13 system—an RNA-targeting platform gaining increasing attention in the fields of gene regulation and RNA-based therapeutics.

RNA molecules can undergo chemical modifications—the addition of specific chemical groups—which alter their function and behavior without changing the underlying nucleotide sequence. However, some of these modifications, a critical layer of post-transcriptional gene regulation, remain poorly understood. Among them, N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) has been particularly enigmatic, with ongoing debate about its existence and function in human messenger RNA (mRNA), the RNA that encodes proteins.

To address this gap, the KAIST research team developed a targeted RNA acetylation system, named dCas13-eNAT10. This platform combines a catalytically inactive Cas13 enzyme (dCas13) that guides the system to specific RNA targets, with a hyperactive variant of the NAT10 enzyme (eNAT10), which performs RNA acetylation. This approach enables precise acetylation of only the desired RNA molecules among the vast pool of transcripts within the cell.

Using this system, the researchers demonstrated that guide RNAs could direct the dCas13-eNAT10 complex to acetylate specific RNA targets, and acetylation significantly increased protein expression from the modified mRNA. Moreover, the study revealed, for the first time, that RNA acetylation plays a role in intracellular RNA localization, facilitating the export of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm—a critical step in gene expression regulation.

To validate its therapeutic potential, the team successfully delivered the targeted RNA acetylation system into the livers of live mice using adeno-associated virus (AAV), a commonly used gene therapy vector. This marks the first demonstration of in vivo RNA modification, extending the applicability of RNA chemical modification tools from cell culture models to living organisms.

Professor Won Do Heo, who previously developed COVID-19 treatment technology using RNA gene scissors and technology to activate RNA gene scissors with light, stated, "Existing RNA chemical modification research faced difficulties in controlling specificity, temporality, and spatiality. However, this new technology allows selective acetylation of desired RNA, opening the door for accurate and detailed research into the functions of RNA acetylation." He added, "The RNA chemical modification technology developed in this study can be widely used as an RNA-based therapeutic agent and a tool for regulating RNA functions in living organisms in the future."

This research, with Ph.D. candidate Jihwan Yu from the Department of Biological Sciences at KAIST as the first author, was published in the journal Nature Chemical Biology on June 2, 2025.

Hyponatremia, or low blood sodium concentration, is typically viewed as a symptomless condition-until recently. A research team led by Professor Yoshihisa Sugimura, including Dr. Haruki Fujisawa, Professor Atsushi Suzuki, Professor Tsuyoshi Miyakawa, and Professor Akihiro Mouri, from Fujita Health University, Japan, has demonstrated that chronic hyponatremia (CHN) can directly cause anxiety-like behaviors in mice by disrupting key neurotransmitters in the brain. Their findings, published online in the journal Molecular Neurobiology on May 14, 2025, reveal that CHN alters monoaminergic signaling in the amygdala, a brain region critical for processing fear and emotion.

"While CHN has been associated with cognitive impairments, our study is among the first to provide evidence that it also leads to innate anxiety-like behaviors through changes in brain chemistry," explains Dr. Fujisawa.

Hyponatremia is usually caused by conditions like liver cirrhosis, heart failure, or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). In chronic cases, the brain adapts to the low-sodium environment by adjusting its cellular content through a compensatory mechanism known as volume regulatory decrease (VRD). But this adaptation, while protective, comes at a physiological cost.

This compensation process involves the loss of organic osmolytes and neurotransmitter precursors that help stabilize brain cell volume under low-sodium conditions. Over time, this may lead to disruption in the production, release, or recycling of key mood-regulating chemicals.

To explore whether CHN could cause neurological manifestations, the researchers developed a mouse model using a sustained infusion of desmopressin (a vasopressin analog) and feeding a liquid diet to mimic SIAD. They found that the mice exhibited significantly lower serum sodium levels, which were maintained over a prolonged period, consistent with chronic hyponatremia (CHN) and exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviors in both the light/dark transition and open field tests-standard behavioral assays in neuroscience.

Further biochemical analyzes revealed that levels of serotonin and dopamine, two key neurotransmitters that regulate mood, were significantly reduced in the amygdala of mice with CHN. These changes were accompanied by a drop in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation-a molecular signal for emotional regulation.

"Our data suggest that CHN disrupts the balance of monoamines in the amygdala, especially serotonin and dopamine, which in turn modulates innate anxiety," says Prof. Sugimura. To test whether these effects were reversible, the researchers corrected the mice's sodium levels by stopping desmopressin infusion and reverting them to a solid diet. As a result, anxiety-like behaviors subsided. Serotonin, dopamine, and ERK phosphorylation levels in the amygdala also returned to normal. "This shows not only that CHN causes anxiety-like symptoms but also that these symptoms can be alleviated with proper correction of sodium imbalance," says Dr. Fujisawa.

While the study focused on mice, the findings could apply to humans. CHN is fairly common among elderly patients and those with chronic illnesses. Identifying and treating its neurological manifestations can improve their quality of life. "Our findings add to the growing evidence that chronic hyponatremia is not just a metabolic abnormality, but a condition with real neurological and psychological consequences," Prof. Sugimura concluded. "This underscores the importance of early diagnosis and treatment, not only to protect the brain but also to improve mental well-being."

Pancreatic cancer is a severe illness and major challenge in cancer medicine since it is difficult to diagnose, while potential therapies are scarce. A new international cooperation study indicates that in the future pancreatic cancer may be detected at an early stage from gut microbes. Gut microbes may also offer solutions for therapy development.

Researchers from HUS, the University of Helsinki, the University of Jyväskylä, Finland, and from Iran have jointly made new observations about gut microbes associated with pancreatic cancer. The researchers analyzed microbes living in the guts of Finnish and Iranian pancreatic cancer patients and their healthy peers. The study involved altogether more than 180 persons. The study is part of Doctoral Researcher Heidelinde Sammallahti's doctoral dissertation research at the University of Helsinki.

The same gut microbes associated with pancreatic cancer were found in the patients irrespective of geographic location and ethnic background.

Pancreatic cancer patients' intestinal flora included significantly more facultative pathogens and significantly less beneficial bacteria than in the healthy peer group.

In particular, beneficial bacteria belonging to the class of Clostridia, such as butyric acid-producing Lachnospiraceae, Butyricicoccaceae and Ruminococcaceae, had decreased.

Pancreatic cancer pathogens include, for example, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcaceae and Fusobacteriaceae. The levels of these in pancreatic cancer patients' intestinal flora were high.

Senior Lecturer Satu Pekkala from the Faculty of Sport and Health Sciences, University of Jyväskylä, summarizes the research team's shared view of the research findings:

"The findings on beneficial Clostridia are interesting because it has been shown earlier that ordinary Clostridiales populations effectively mediate anti-canceric immune reactions against solid tumors."

The researchers accordingly point out that future research projects should investigate whether these could serve as a new generation of probiotics, that is, living microbic products, which could be combined with traditional chemotherapy medicines. This could provide a more targeted and effective approach to the control of pancreatic cancer, the researchers suggest, while they also emphasise the need for further research to confirm the present findings in different populations.

The researchers also developed a statistical model based on the microbiome, by means of which it could be possible to predict pancreatic cancer. It is a good first step to enable early recognition of pancreatic cancer in the future.

A rich and varied mix of microbes in the mouth, particularly bacteria, is not only important for our oral health, but may hold clues for other conditions. A new study led by researchers at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing finds that a lower diversity of microbes in the mouth is associated with depression.

The mouth is home to between 500 billion and 1 trillion bacteria-the second-largest community of microorganisms in our bodies, after the gut. A growing number of studies point to the connection between the oral microbiome and our overall health, from diabetes to dementia, a relationship thought to be driven by inflammation and disruptions to the immune system.

A recent study in mice found a potential link between depression and the diversity of bacteria in the gut, but less is known about the connection between the oral microbiome and depression.

"Having a better understanding of the relationship between the oral microbiome and depression could not only help us learn about the mechanisms underlying depression, but could contribute to the development of new biomarkers or treatments for mood disorders," said Bei Wu, vice dean for research at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing and the senior author of the study, published in the journal BMC Oral Health.

To explore the connection between the oral microbiome and depression, the researchers examined survey and biological data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Using data from more than 15,000 US adults ages 18 and older collected between 2009 and 2012, the researchers compared questionnaires measuring symptoms of depression with saliva samples. Gene sequencing was used to identify the microbes in the saliva and measure the diversity of the oral microbiome.

The researchers found that people with less diversity in their oral microbiomes were more likely to have symptoms of depression. Additional analyses showed that smoking, drinking, and dental care-all of which can change the makeup of bacteria in the mouth-influenced the relationship between the oral microbiome and depression.

These findings suggest that, with more research, the oral microbiome could potentially be used to diagnose or treat depression. However, based on this study, it's not clear whether the diversity of microbes in the mouth influences depression or if depression leads to changes in the oral microbiome-or if there's a bidirectional relationship between the two. 

It's possible that the oral microbiome influences depressive symptoms through inflammation or changes to the immune system. Conversely, depression can drive changes including dietary intake, poor oral hygiene, increased smoking and drinking, or the use of medications-all of which have the potential to alter the oral microbiome. We need more research to understand the direction and underlying pathways of this relationship."

Bei Wu, vice dean for research at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing 

"This work is part of a broader effort to understand how the oral microbiome influences not only mental health, but also cognitive decline and the onset of dementia," she added.

Additional study authors include Xichenhui Qiu, Ting Xu, Yiqing Huang, Changning Wei, and Lina Wang.

Leg amputation rates caused by arterial disease are four times as high in the most disadvantaged areas in England. 

The new study, from the University of Sheffield, also found patients living in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas are more likely to die following leg amputation compared with those living in the least disadvantaged areas. 

Whilst socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with a higher risk of amputation, this new study highlights the worrying scale of the disparities. 

Peripheral arterial disease is a debilitating condition caused by a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries to the legs which restricts blood supply. Major amputation of the lower limb is a last resort when other treatment options do not exist or have failed.

The main reasons for amputation include severe infection of the leg and gangrene caused by restricted arterial blood supply.

The new study, funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), examined associations between socioeconomic deprivation and ethnicity and major leg amputation in England.

The researchers analysed hospital admissions and census area data over a 12-year period from 2006 to 2018. During the study period there were a total of 47,249 major lower limb amputations due to peripheral arterial disease.

The researchers found the main disparities were as a result of socioeconomic inequalities. 

Above knee amputation was around four times as high in the most disadvantaged compared with the least disadvantaged areas, while below knee amputation was around three times as high.

Although amputation rates decreased in all socioeconomic categories from 2006 to 2018 in the population aged over 65 years, there was little change in the population under 65.

Being told you need to have a leg amputated can be a devastating and frightening experience for patients.

Greater efforts are needed in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas in order to prevent and manage peripheral arterial disease, reduce amputation rates and improve survival following amputation."

Using advanced single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and a widely used preclinical model for Alzheimer's disease, researchers from Mass General Brigham and collaborators at SUNY Upstate Medical University have identified specific brain cell types that responded most to exercise. These findings, which were validated in samples from people, shed light on the connection between exercise and brain health and point to future drug targets. Results are published in Nature Neuroscience. 

"While we've long known that exercise helps protect the brain, we didn't fully understand which cells were responsible or how it worked at a molecular level," said senior author Christiane D. Wrann, DVM, PhD, a neuroscientist and leader of the Program in Neuroprotection in Exercise at the Mass General Brigham Heart and Vascular Institute and the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital. "Now, we have a detailed map of how exercise impacts each major cell type in the memory center of the brain in Alzheimer's disease." 

The study focused on a part of the hippocampus-a critical region for memory and learning that is damaged early in Alzheimer's disease. The research team leveraged single-nuclei RNA sequencing, a relatively new technologies that allow researchers to look at activity at the molecular level in single cells for an in-depth understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's. 

The researchers exercised a common mouse model for Alzheimer's disease using running wheels, which improved their memory compared to the sedentary counterparts. They then analyzed gene activity across thousands of individual brain cells, finding that exercise changed activity both in microglia, a disease-associated population of brain cells, and in a specific type of neurovascular-associated astrocyte (NVA), newly discovered by the team, which are cells associated with blood vessels in the brain. Furthermore, the scientist identified the metabolic gene Atpif1 as an important regulator to create new neurons in the brain. "That we were able to modulate newborn neurons using our new target genes set underscores the promise our study," said lead author Joana Da Rocha, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow working in Dr. Wrann's lab. 

To ensure the findings were relevant to humans, the team validated their discoveries in a large dataset of human Alzheimer's brain tissue, finding striking similarities. 

This work not only sheds light on how exercise benefits the brain but also uncovers potential cell-specific targets for future Alzheimer's therapies. Our study offers a valuable resource for the scientific community investigating Alzheimer's prevention and treatment."

One of the biggest challenges in drug discovery is the high failure rate of drug candidates in clinical trials—approximately 90 percent fail. This is largely due to the limitations of 2D cell cultures and animal models, which often do not accurately replicate the complexity of human tissues. In contrast, organoids and other 3D models better mimic human biology, offering more predictive platforms for drug screening, toxicity assessment, and disease modeling.

Organoids offer several key advantages over traditional models. They provide better biological relevance by replicating the structural complexity, organization, and functionality of human tissues. Their higher predictive accuracy bridges the gap between simple cell-based assays and whole-organ systems, making them more valuable for drug discovery. Organoids are also more cost-effective than animal models, offering faster and higher-throughput screening. Additionally, patient-derived organoids enable personalized medicine by allowing scientists to test drug responses on models derived from individual patients.

Despite their potential, organoids face several barriers to broader adoption. Culturing organoids is labor-intensive and time-consuming, often requiring significant expertise and manual handling. Technical complexity is another hurdle, as processes like seeding, feeding, passaging, and monitoring demand high precision. Reproducibility remains a challenge, with difficulty in standardizing organoid formation across multiple wells or plates. Scalability is also an issue, as adapting organoid models for high-throughput screening is still evolving. However, advances in automation, high-content imaging, and machine learning-based analysis are helping to overcome these challenges.

Automation plays a crucial role in overcoming the challenges associated with organoid research by simplifying workflows and improving reproducibility, scalability, and overall efficiency. New technologies now enable automated cell seeding, feeding, and passaging, which reduce the need for manual labor. Automated media exchange maintains consistency while preserving organoid integrity. High-throughput imaging and real-time analysis provide valuable insights into organoid development. Additionally, machine learning-driven decision-making allows software to guide experimental timing based on image analysis. These capabilities are making 3D biology more accessible for large-scale research and drug discovery.

The CellXpress.ai system is an automated platform designed to streamline and scale organoid workflows. It integrates an automated incubator, a liquid handling system, a high-content imager, and a robotic elevator for plate movement. This comprehensive setup enables full automation of complex processes such as cell seeding, feeding, passaging, imaging, and data analysis. Researchers can create customizable workflows, control pipetting speeds and volumes, and adjust protocols in real time based on imaging results. This level of automation enhances reproducibility, improves efficiency, and enables researchers to run multiple protocols simultaneously, making it a powerful solution for high-throughput drug discovery.

High-content imaging is essential for studying organoids because it delivers detailed 3D insights that 2D imaging methods simply cannot provide. Techniques like confocal imaging allow researchers to penetrate organoid structures and visualize internal features. This enables the generation of 3D image stacks for volumetric analysis and allows for characterization of organoid shape, size, and density over time. Researchers can also analyze individual cell populations within an organoid to monitor viability, proliferation, and phenotypic changes. These capabilities significantly enhance drug screening, toxicity assessments, and disease modeling, making organoids more practical and powerful for pharmaceutical research.

Functional assays allow researchers to observe physiological responses in real time, offering insights that go beyond structural or viability assessments. Calcium flux analysis is especially valuable in specific organoid models. In cardiac organoids, it can measure beat rate, amplitude, and rhythmicity, helping to evaluate how drugs affect cardiac function. In neurospheroid assays, calcium flux can detect neuronal oscillations, offering insights into the effects of neuroactive drugs. Additionally, irregular calcium signaling can serve as an early indicator of cytotoxicity. These kinetic measurements provide a more comprehensive view of drug effects than static endpoint imaging.

Automated organoid workflows have significantly advanced research in several key areas. In cancer research, patient-derived tumoroids are used to evaluate drug responses in a personalized medicine context. Neurospheroids are being applied in neurodegenerative disease modeling to study potential treatments for conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In the area of cardiotoxicity screening, high-throughput assays using cardiac organoids are improving the evaluation of drug safety for conditions like heart failure and arrhythmia. Liver organoids are also gaining traction as alternative models for pharmaceutical toxicology, reducing reliance on animal testing. Automation enables the scalability of these applications, accelerating discoveries while reducing cost and variability.

The future of 3D biology lies in the integration of fully automated, AI-powered platforms that combine automated culture and screening workflows with advanced imaging and machine learning-based analysis. These systems will also incorporate functional assays to provide deeper insights into cellular behavior. Personalized medicine will benefit significantly as patient-derived organoids become a routine part of drug testing. By moving away from outdated 2D and animal models toward human-relevant, high-throughput systems, we can accelerate the pace of drug discovery, improve translational success, and ultimately deliver better outcomes for patients.

Taking the progestogen-only contraceptive pill desogestrel continuously for more than five years is associated with a small increased risk of developing a type of brain tumor called an intracranial meningioma, finds a study from France published by The BMJ today.

However, the researchers stress that the risk is low compared with some other progestogens (for every 67,000 women taking desogestrel, one might need surgery for meningioma) and disappeared one year after stopping treatment.

Intracranial meningiomas are typically non-cancerous brain tumors that occasionally require surgery. They are more common in older women, but many studies lack information on the specific type of progestogen used, and risk has not been measured for continuous, current, and long term use.

To address this knowledge gap, researchers set out to assess the real-life risk of intracranial meningioma associated with short-term (less than 1 year) and prolonged (1-7 or more years) use of oral contraceptives containing desogestrel 75µg, levonorgestrel 30µg, or levonorgestrel 50-150 µg combined with estrogen.

Their findings are based on data from the French national health data system (SNDS) for 8,391 women (average age 60; 75% older than 45) who had undergone surgery for intracranial meningioma in 2020-2023. Each case was matched to 10 control women without meningioma (total 83,910) of the same age and area of residence. 

Potentially influential factors, including use of a known high-risk progestogen in the six years before the study, were taken into account.

The results show a small increased risk associated with use of desogestrel for more than five continuous years. 

An increased risk was not found for shorter durations or when desogestrel had been discontinued for more than one year, but it was if other progestogens of known associated increased risk of meningioma had been used in the six years before desogestrel.

This excess risk was greater in women older than 45 years, those with a meningioma located in the front or middle of the skull, and after prolonged use of one of the known high risk progestogens before desogestrel.

The authors estimate that 67,000 women would need to use desogestrel for one woman to need surgery for intracranial meningioma, and 17,000 women if current use was for more than five years. 

Reassuringly, no increased risk of meningioma was found for levonorgestrel, alone or combined with estrogen, regardless of duration of use. 

This is an observational study so can't establish cause and effect, and the authors acknowledge that some information may be missing from the SNDS database. Nor were they able to account for genetic predisposition and exposure to high dose radiation - factors that may have affected the results.

However, by using comprehensive, real-life data, including history of using other known high risk progestogens, they were able to improve reliability and minimise bias.

As such, they suggest that desogestrel should be discontinued if an intracranial meningioma is identified and patients monitored rather than undergoing immediate surgery.

Although direct evidence is still lacking, stopping treatment when desogestrel related meningioma is diagnosed may preclude the need for surgery, says neurosurgeon Gilles Reuter in a linked editorial.

"It is already common knowledge that stopping cyproterone, nomegestrol, chlormadinone, promegestone, medroxyprogesterone, or medrogestone precludes the need for surgery," he explains. "Now we know that stopping desogestrel may also avoid unnecessary potentially harmful treatments."

A new method improving the accuracy of interpreting blood pressure measurements taken at the ankle could be crucial for people who cannot have their arm blood pressure measured.

New research from the University of Exeter Medical School, published in BMJ Open and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), analysed data from over 33,000 people to create a personalized predictive model for more accurately estimating arm blood pressure from ankle readings - when compared to previously available methods. The team has developed an online calculator for healthcare professionals and patients to interpret these readings effectively.

High blood pressure affects over one billion people globally, increasing the risk of serious health issues like heart, brain, and kidney diseases. It's therefore very important to measure and interpret blood pressure readings as accurately as possible. While blood pressure is typically measured on the arm, sometimes this is not possible due to disability, missing limbs, or problems caused by conditions such as stroke. Blood pressure can be measured at the ankle instead, but these readings are generally higher than arm values. Standard guidelines for treating blood pressure are based on arm readings only, which creates complications in making accurate estimations based on ankle measurements, potentially leading to misdiagnoses.

Professor Chris Clark from the University of Exeter Medical School led the study and said: "Our new method will give a more accurate blood pressure reading for around two percent more people. This doesn't sound a big number but remember, around a third of adults have high blood pressure and once you get into your 60s it's more than half of the adults. The NHS Health Check Programme diagnoses 38,000 new cases annually in England alone, so two percent equates to 750 fewer potential misdiagnoses per year in England, and tens of thousands globally."

Researchers used statistical modelling on arm and ankle blood pressure readings from 33,710 people (mean age 58 years, 45 per cent female) across the world to help describe the relationship between arm and ankle blood pressures, predict arm blood pressure using ankle blood pressure readings, and predict important health outcomes (such as risk of heart attacks) from ankle blood pressure readings.

This research could help address a health inequality by providing accurate and personalised blood pressure measurements for people who previously could not have their blood pressure measured accurately from their arm. It's estimated there are up to 10,000 adults currently living in the UK with upper limb loss, while 75 per cent of the country's 1.3 million stroke survivors have upper limb dysfunction, sometimes making it difficult to measure blood pressure from their arm.

The study was supported by the Stroke Association and Thalidomide Trust.

Someone in the UK has a stroke every five minutes, with high blood pressure accounting for around half of those. Around two-thirds of stroke survivors will leave hospital with some form of disability, including paralysis in an arm, which can prevent getting accurate blood pressure readings from the affected limb. Many stroke survivors feel anxious about having another stroke, so receiving an accurate blood pressure reading in the ankle will not only provide benefits in the primary prevention of stroke, but importantly in easing the minds of stroke survivors who are already dealing with the devastating impact of stroke."

Juliet Bouverie OBE, CEO of the Stroke Association

Professor Kevin Munro, Director of NIHR's Research for Patient Benefit Programme, said: "This research has identified an ingenious solution to an important problem - finding a way to measure blood pressure for people who cannot have it monitored via the upper arm. Keeping track of blood pressure is a vital tool to help keep people healthy and this NIHR-funded research will help to spot high blood pressure and treat it even more widely."

The paper titled 'Arm Based on LEg blood pressures (ABLE-BP): Can systolic ankle blood pressure measurements predict systolic arm blood pressure? An individual participant data meta-analysis from the INTERPRESS-IPD Collaboration' is published in BMJ Open.

The online calculator is available at: ABLE-BP Tool

TV presenter Sue Kent, 62 from Swansea, has an upper limb disability caused by the drug Thalidomide, which was prescribed to her mother during pregnancy. She has eight-inch arms which aren't big enough for blood pressure to be taken.

Sue said: "I rarely had my blood pressure taken when I was younger, but when I did, I used to have a really big cuff they would put around my thigh and take the blood pressure there. Whether it was accurate or not nobody worried, but I didn't seem to have blood pressure problems.

"But then I had a cataract operation, and somebody took my blood pressure from my ankle, and it was very high. They did it three times and every time it was high, and it made me very worried. They (medical staff) weren't worried and carried on and did the cataract operation, but I was quite distressed."

Sue was diagnosed with Meniere's disease in 2017, which is a rare inner ear condition which has left her partially deaf.

She said: "I was worried I was going to have a stroke because Meniere's can be an indicator the blood flow isn't going to the brain. I knew I couldn't have my blood pressure taken accurately, so I went privately to have dye injected to check everything was OK.

"As you get older blood pressure is an important indicator of so many things, including things that could be seriously wrong. Prodding about in the dark and guessing isn't really a safe thing to do. You need the right information about your blood pressure."

Sue hopes this new method could potentially help her and thousands of others like her have something most of us take for granted – an accurate blood pressure reading.

She said: "Why should I not be able to have my blood pressure taken when it's available to most people and is a relatively simple thing to do?

"When you're disabled, you're more likely to die younger for a variety of reasons, so this resource tips the scales a bit more in our favour. This could put us on a level playing field with everybody else when it comes to blood pressure. It means reassurance and maybe an early diagnosis if something is wrong."

Stroke and dementia as well as late-life depression are more common in people who have a biomarker of aging called short leukocyte telomere length, according to a study published on June 11, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The good news is that this relationship was not found in people with healthy lifestyle habits, such as eating healthy and maintaining low cholesterol and blood pressure.

The study does not prove that shorter telomeres cause these brain diseases; it only shows an association.

Our findings support the potential benefits of working to improve your risk factors such as maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol and getting enough sleep and exercise in reducing the risk of age-related brain disease even in people who are already showing signs of damaging biological aging."

Christopher D. Anderson, MD, MMSc, study author of Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology

Telomeres are protective caps at the end of chromosomes. They shorten each time cells divide, making them key biomarkers of biological aging, reflecting the cumulative biological stresses a person has experienced. This study looked at the length of telomeres in white blood cells, called leukocytes.

For the study, researchers analyzed records of 356,173 people in the United Kingdom with an average age of 56 who had information on the length of their leukocyte telomeres and about their risk factors such as diet and smoking. The participants were divided into three groups based on how long their telomeres were: short, medium or long.

The researchers also looked at a modified Brain Care Score that evaluates risk factors associated with stroke, dementia and late-life depression. On a 19-point scale, people with scores of 15 points or higher were considered to have good brain care and people with scores of 10 or lower were considered to have poor brain care.

Then researchers looked to see whether participants developed any of three age-related brain diseases: stroke, dementia and late-life depression during an average of seven years of follow-up. During that time, 25,964 people developed at least one age-related brain disease.

Those with the shortest telomeres had 5.82 cases of the brain diseases per 1,000 person-years, compared to 3.92 cases per 1,000 for those with the longest telomeres. Person-years represent both the number of people in the study and the amount of time each person spends in the study.

When researchers adjusted for other factors that could affect the risk of brain diseases, such as age, high blood pressure and smoking, they found that people with short telomeres were 11% more likely to develop at least one of the three brain diseases than people with long telomeres. 

But when researchers looked at the Brain Care Scores, they found that people with short telomeres who had high Brain Care Scores did not have a higher risk of developing the brain diseases. 

"These results suggest that healthy lifestyle behaviors could delay the aging of our cells and reduce the frequency of these diseases, especially in people who are greater risk," Anderson said.

A limitation of the study was that only people of European ancestry were included, so the results may not apply to other groups.

The study was supported by the American Heart Association-Bugher Foundation Centers of Excellence in Hemorrhagic Stroke Research, the National Institutes of Health and the Massachusetts General Hospital McCance Center for Brain Health.

After decades of stalled national progress in reducing the rate of Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID), a category of infant mortality that includes sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), researchers at Rutgers Health have proposed an unexpected solution: Caffeine might protect babies by preventing dangerous drops in oxygen that may trigger deaths.

The hypothesis, published in the Journal of Perinatology, comes as the number of SUID cases has plateaued nationally at about 3,500 deaths a year for 25 years or one death for every 1000 live births. Despite an initial decline in the 1990s with the introduction of widespread education campaigns promoting back to sleep and other safe infant sleep recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics, SIDS, even on its own, remains the leading cause of death in infants between 1 and 12 months old.

"We've been concerned about why the rates haven't changed," said Thomas Hegyi, a neonatologist at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School who led the research. "So, we wanted to explore new ways of approaching the challenge."

That approach led Hegyi and Ostfeld to a striking realization: Virtually all known risk factors for SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths, from stomach sleeping to maternal smoking to bed-sharing to preterm birth, have one thing in common. They are all associated with intermittent hypoxia, brief episodes where oxygen levels drop below 80%.

I wondered, what can counter intermittent hypoxia? Caffeine."

Thomas Hegyi, neonatologist, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School 

The connection isn't entirely theoretical. Neonatologists already use caffeine to treat apnea in premature infants, where it works as a respiratory stimulant. The drug has an excellent safety profile in babies, with minimal side effects even at high doses.

What makes caffeine particularly intriguing as a proposed preventive measure is how differently infants process it. While adults metabolize caffeine in about four hours, the half-life in newborns can be as long as 100 hours. Caffeine remains in an infant's system for weeks, not hours.

This unique metabolism might explain a long-standing puzzle: why SIDS peaks between two and four months of age. As infants mature, they begin metabolizing caffeine more quickly. The researchers suggest caffeine consumed during pregnancy or passed through breast milk might provide early protection that wanes as metabolism speeds up.

The theory also could explain why breastfeeding appears to protect against SIDS.

"We hypothesize that the protection afforded by breast milk is, in part, due to caffeine," wrote the researchers, noting caffeine readily passes from mothers to infants through breast milk.

Barbara Ostfeld, a professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, the program director of the SIDS Center of New Jersey and co-author of the paper, said if the theory proves true, any efforts to give infants caffeine would complement, not replace, existing risk reduction strategies.

"The idea isn't that caffeine will replace risk-reduction behaviors," Ostfeld said. "A baby dying from accidental suffocation, one component of SUID, is not likely to have benefited from caffeine but would have from such safe sleep practices as the elimination of pillows and other loose bedding from the infant's sleep environment."

The researchers plan to test their hypothesis by comparing caffeine levels in infants who died of SIDS with those who died from other causes, such as trauma or disease.

The research represents a fundamental shift in approaching SIDS prevention. While current strategies focus on eliminating environmental risks, this would be the first potential pharmaceutical intervention.

"For over 30 years, we've been educating New Jersey's parents about adopting safe infant sleep practices. These efforts have contributed to our state rates being the second lowest in the US. Still, for various reasons, these proven recommendations are not universally adopted," Ostfeld said. "This new hypothesis offers a way not just to address important risk factors but potentially intervene."

Crucially, the researchers said this is hypothesis-generating research meant to inspire further study, not a recommendation for parents to give their babies caffeine. Any intervention would require extensive testing for safety and efficacy.

Still, in a field where progress has stagnated for decades, the possibility of a new approach offers hope.

As Hegyi put it, the goal is "to stimulate new thinking about a problem that has remained unchanged for 25 years."

A new analysis shows that targeting high-risk regions with the IXCHIQ vaccine could dramatically curb the global impact of chikungunya, offering hope against this rapidly spreading mosquito-borne virus.

In a recent review in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers attempted to quantify the global disease burden of chikungunya viruses (CHIKV) and identify high-risk populations, as well as evaluate the potential impacts of the first licensed anti-CHIKV vaccines. The study specifically models the potential impact of the recently licensed IXCHIQ vaccine (VLA1553, Valneva), not VIMKUNYA, which received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), respectively. Importantly, IXCHIQ was licensed based on immunological correlates of protection rather than classical phase 3 efficacy data, due to the unpredictable nature of chikungunya outbreaks. Study findings reveal that of the 180 countries analyzed, 104 experienced CHIKV transmission, corresponding to 2.8 billion exposed individuals, 35.3 million (95% CI: 20.9–56.5 million) annual CHIKV infections, and epidemic outbreaks every ~6.2 years.

Vaccination models assumed 70% vaccine efficacy, 40% infection protection, and 50% coverage (individuals ≥12 yrs). These models reveal that targeted vaccination programs could prevent 4,400 (95% CI: 3,800–4,800) infections, 0.35 (0.30–0.37) deaths, and 17 (15–19) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per 100,000 doses, highlighting the potential of strategic vaccination programs in significantly reducing CHIKV's disease burden and human suffering. However, these outcomes are based on modelled scenarios and remain sensitive to key assumptions regarding vaccine characteristics, coverage, duration of protection, and speed of outbreak detection and response.

The impact of vaccination is projected to be higher in epidemic settings than in endemic settings, with a noted 83% greater effect in epidemic regions.



 Endemic: CHIKV circulates persistently in the territory, with infections occurring every year. Epidemic: CHIKV circulates sporadically in the territory, with outbreaks being followed by years without detected circulation. No transmission: CHIKV does not circulate in the territory. Good evidence: Epidemiological data from disease surveillance and/or serological data and/or entomological data provide robust evidence for the given classification. Insufficient evidence: Epidemiological, serological, and entomological data do not provide robust evidence to support the given likely classification.

Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an RNA virus belonging to the Alphavirus genus within the family Togaviridae. Primarily transmitted by bites from infected Aedes mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus), the disease is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, joint pain (arthralgia), and rashes, with approximately 50% of detected acute cases developing chronic joint pain that may persist for several months.

While CHIKV-associated mortality is rare (~1 death per 1,000 cases), its high (and reportedly increasing) prevalence in tropical and subtropical regions, frequent endemic transmission and sporadic epidemic episodes, and non-uniform demographic outcomes (neonates, infants, and older individuals are at significantly higher acute disease risk than healthy adults) underscores the need for global monitoring and strategic intervention deployment for optimal public health benefits.

Despite decades of research, few clinical interventions and limited epidemiological data exist for CHIKV. The former concern has been recently addressed with the licensing of the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)'s novel anti-CHIKV vaccine (IXCHIQ) by both the United States (FDA) and European (EMA) public health agencies. The study mentions the approval of the VIMKUNYA vaccine, but modeling projections were conducted only for IXCHIQ.

Unfortunately, since CHIKV's global burden remains poorly quantified, the potential public health impact of IXCHIQ and other vaccines remains unclear. Understanding the disease's global reach is imperative before effective immunization strategies can be developed and deployed.

The present review addresses these knowledge gaps by integrating multidisciplinary data sources (seroprevalence data, surveillance systems data, and geographic mosquito distribution patterns) to estimate CHIKV's global burden and model the potential benefits of vaccination campaigns. It aims to guide policymakers on where and when to deploy vaccines to curb the disease and disability burden.

Study data was obtained via a literature review of Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, GIDEON, WHO/PAHO, and ProMED digital scientific repositories. Studies investigating countries and territories with population sizes of 200,000 or more (n = 180) were included in subsequent analyses. Where available, age-stratified seroprevalence data (n = 49), surveillance systems data (from National Ministry of Health websites), and mosquito vector maps (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) were extracted.

Researchers used statistical models to compute: 1. Associations between mosquito vector data and CHIKV prevalence, 2. Country/territory-specific epidemic status (using the Healthcare Access and Quality [HAQ] Index), and 3. CHIKV transmission dynamics (using a custom Markov chain Monte Carlo [MCMC]-leveraging serocatalytic model). The results from these models were subsequently used to inform: 1. Epidemic CHIKV models, 2. Endemic CHIKV models, and 3. Vaccination simulations.

Vaccination simulations assumed a 70% efficacy rate, a 40% reduction in infection prevention, and a 50% population coverage rate. Outcomes were presented as ‘per 100,000 doses', providing both burden quantification and a vaccine-impact forecast to inform public health decision-making. The authors emphasize that their projections are sensitive to assumptions regarding vaccine efficacy, protection duration, rollout logistics, and the accuracy of disease surveillance.

Review analyses revealed that ~2.8 billion individuals across 104 countries and territories are exposed to CHIKV transmission, with 2.4% and 1.6% of them contracting the infection in endemic and epidemic regions, respectively. Additionally, epidemic outbreaks were predicted to occur every ~6.2 years, each of which resulted in 8.4% of the susceptible population being infected with CHIKV. Together, these findings predict ~35.3 million (20.9–56.5 million) global infections annually, with the majority of cases concentrated in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Americas.

Vaccination simulations suggest that every 100,000 IXCHIQ doses administered could avert 4,400 (3,800–4,800) CHIKV infections, prevent 0.35 (0.30–0.37) deaths, and save 17 (15–19) DALYs. Vaccination projections further suggest that IXCHIQ can provide substantial protective benefits at the population level, underscoring the benefits of deploying vaccines where and when outbreaks are imminent. The impact of vaccination is projected to be greater in epidemic settings compared to endemic settings. The authors note that mixed or locally adapted immunization strategies may be required within countries.

The paper also compares chikungunya's burden to that of dengue virus, noting that while CHIKV causes fewer symptomatic cases overall, both diseases disproportionately affect the same regions, and the patterns of endemic and epidemic transmission differ. The authors highlight that a significant proportion of CHIKV infections may be subclinical, meaning true infection numbers are likely higher than reported case data.

Vaccine safety considerations are addressed, with clinical trial data showing that severe adverse events occurred in approximately 2% of recipients and mild-to-moderate arthralgia in up to 18%, although these were not included in the DALY calculations. Ongoing and future phase 4 studies are expected to further clarify the real-world effectiveness and safety profile of these vaccines.

Together, these findings provide a quantified rationale for prioritizing high-risk regions and inform public health agencies of the ideal immunization strategies to reduce CHIKV-related morbidity and mortality worldwide.

This review presents the first comprehensive estimate of CHIKV's global burden, demonstrating the potential of CEPI's novel IXCHIQ (modeled) and VIMKUNYA (approved but not modeled) vaccines in mitigating disease outcomes, thereby preventing thousands of infections, dozens of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), and CHIKV-associated mortality per 100,000 doses in outbreak settings. It highlights high-risk regions (countries or territories), their endemic or epidemic status, and the strategic importance of timely CHIKV vaccinations.

Overall, this review informs IXCHIQ deployment policy by utilizing evidence-based transmission and risk data, thereby optimizing vaccine use to significantly reduce disease and suffering. However, the authors caution that the modelled benefits depend on rapid outbreak detection, efficient stockpile deployment, and the ability to adapt vaccination strategies to local epidemiology and healthcare infrastructure.

A new pilot project led by McGill University researchers is showing early success in helping cancer survivors return to work, addressing an aspect of recovery they say is often overlooked.

iCanWork is an online support program being developed by Christine Maheu, Associate Professor at McGill's Ingram School of Nursing, in collaboration with BC Cancer.

Work isn't considered a key health indicator in cancer care, even though it's a major concern from the moment someone is diagnosed and is associated with better quality of life in survivors."

Christine Maheu, Associate Professor at McGill's Ingram School of Nursing

Lingering side effects of cancer treatment like fatigue, "chemo brain" and anxiety can make it hard to focus, stay organized and manage stress, making the return to work feel overwhelming, she explained.

In a randomized trial involving 24 cancer survivors, Maheu and her colleagues evaluated the effectiveness of iCanWork.

In the 10-step program, survivors met virtually with return-to-work counsellors and therapists who helped manage the hurdles to reintegration and referred them to additional specialists when needed.

Half of the participants returned to full-time work within three months, compared to about one-third in the control group. Participants also reported working more effectively, feeling more socially connected and found pain interfered less in their daily lives.

"One participant said without the sessions, she would have quit. Another had considered early retirement but changed her plans," said Maheu.

The first-of-its-kind program aims to fill a gap in Canadian cancer care. Only four per cent of employers have cancer-specific return-to-work policies, which the authors say are more common in some European countries.

The gap also has financial consequences. Maheu said previous research shows that, on average, cancer patients face over $2,500 a month in lost wages and out-of-pocket expenses like medication and home care. Employers, meanwhile, often spend up to $24,000 to replace a worker on medical leave. "Having proper support in place benefits both sides," said Maheu.

The team is preparing a larger trial and looking for partners to help scale iCanWork across Canada.

The structured program tested in the study is still in development, but survivors can already access tools and resources through the Cancer and Work website, launched in 2016 and recognized with the 2020 CIHR Inclusive Research Excellence Prize for its accessible and inclusive design.

From the new-look format to the qualification criteria and venues, Al Jazeera gives a lowdown on the tournament.

The FIFA Club World Cup 2025 kicks off in the United States on Saturday, with 32 teams vying for the title in the new-look expanded intercontinental club competition.

Here's everything you need to know about the tournament:

Until 2023, the FIFA Club World Cup was staged as an annual tournament every December and participation was limited to the winners of the continental club competitions, with the number ranging between six to eight clubs.

Starting in 2025, football's governing body expanded the tournament to 32 teams and decided to run the revamped competition on a quadrennial cycle instead, similar to its showpiece FIFA World Cup.

A new FIFA Intercontinental Cup replaced the old Club World Cup as an annual competition in December 2024 with Real Madrid winning the inaugural edition held in Qatar.

Historically, the Club World Cup has featured no more than eight teams, but the 2025 edition is vastly different.

This year's edition on US soil will be the first in the tournament's 24-year history to feature 32 clubs – the same number of teams as recent FIFA World Cups – including the winners of the four previous continental championships.

The teams will be divided into eight groups of four competing in a round-robin group stage with the top two clubs from each group advancing to the knockouts, which begin with the round of 16 and end with the final.

The competition will begin on June 14, with the final scheduled for July 13. Here's a breakdown of the schedule.

“Soccer” fans in the US will have the chance to watch some of the most popular clubs, including last season's UEFA Champions League winners Real Madrid, Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich, 10-time English champions Manchester City and Italian heavyweights Inter Milan.

Qualified teams were determined by the winners of the continental club competitions, such as the Champions League, and the confederation's four-year rankings.

Outside of Europe, Lionel Messi's Inter Miami is also part of the tournament, having controversially earned a spot as a representative of the host nation. Inter Miami won the Supporters' Shield, handed to the team with the best regular-season record.

Of the 32 clubs, Europe (UEFA) is the best-represented confederation with 12 teams, followed by South America (CONMEBOL) with six. Asia (AFC), Africa (AFC) and North, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF) have four teams each.

Oceania is represented by one club, while the final slot has been allocated to the host nation's representative, Inter Miami.

Mexican club Leon had qualified by winning the CONCACAF Champions Cup in 2023, but were removed by FIFA due to an ownership rule breach. FIFA said that Club Leon and another Mexican club in the tournament, Pachuca, did not meet regulations on multi-club ownership. Pachuca's spot in the competition was unaffected.

After the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected Leon's appeal, FIFA confirmed a playoff between Los Angeles FC and Mexican side Club America that was won by LAFC.

Here is a list of the eight groups:

FIFA rules for the Club World Cup state that only two teams from each country can play in the tournament, and European clubs' participation was decided by their performances in the Champions League over the last four seasons.

Man City (2023) and Chelsea (2021) won the Champions League during that four-year window, taking up the two spots.

Other popular clubs such as Napoli, AC Milan, Barcelona, RB Leipzig and Sevilla also missed out due to UEFA's four-year club coefficient rankings and two-team restrictions.

The 63 matches will be played across 12 venues in 11 cities. The opening match, Al Ahly vs Inter Miami, will be played at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, which has a spectator capacity of 65,000.

The MetLife Stadium, which serves as the home for the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL), will host both the semifinals and the final. MetLife is an 82,500-seat venue and was also chosen as the venue of the 2026 FIFA World Cup final.

Pasadena's Rose Bowl, best known as a college American football venue, is the biggest stadium with a capacity of 88,500. It is no stranger to hosting big events: the Rose Bowl was the site for the football gold medal match at the Los Angeles Games in 1984, as well as the men's World Cup final a decade later. It will also be a venue for the Olympic Games Los Angeles 2028.

Here's the full list of venues:



Messi will, thanks to Inter Miami's surprise qualification.

Messi's club found a place as the club with the most points in Major League Soccer's (MLS) regular season, instead of LA Galaxy, who won the MLS Cup, which is regarded as the highest prize in the MLS.

FIFA announced Miami's addition to the Club World Cup in October after they broke MLS's regular-season points record with a 6-2 win over New England Revolution to reach 74 points. New England had set the previous record in 2021 with 73 points.

Meanwhile, Ronaldo and his Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr did not qualify for the tournament, but it didn't stop FIFA President Gianni Infantino from suggesting that the Portugal star could switch to one of the teams participating in the tournament.

“Cristiano Ronaldo might play in the Club World Cup,” Infantino told online streamer IShowSpeed in late May. “There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup, who knows? Still, a few weeks' time, will be fun.”

However, Ronaldo cleared his position by saying, “You can't take part in everything.”

“You have to think about the short, medium and long term. It's a decision practically made on my part not to go to the Club World Cup, but I've had quite a few invitations to go.”

The total prize pot is $1bn, with the champions earning up to $125m.

About half of the $1bn will be divided between the 32 clubs, with the amount per club based on sporting and commercial criteria. It means that clubs such as Manchester City and Real Madrid will receive a greater percentage than smaller clubs in a model FIFA developed with the European Club Association.

A further $475m will be awarded on a performance-related basis. Hence, the team with the most wins over a potential seven matches will bank more cash, with a maximum pot of $125m available.

Al Jazeera Sport will run a live photo and text commentary stream for a selection of the biggest group stage and knockout games.

Online provider DAZN will stream the tournament worldwide, with territorial sublicensing to local free-to-air linear broadcast networks a possibility.

We are still over a year away from the 2026 World Cup, but it's never too early to take stock of the players who will represent the United States men's national team at the planet's biggest sporting event. 

Under USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino, there will be some obvious choices for who makes up the 26-player roster. But expect some roles to be up for grabs, especially if this team continues to struggle amid a shocking four-game losing streak going into the Gold Cup.

And that could lead to plenty of surprises when the squad is officially named next year.

If the World Cup started today, which players would make up the starting XI? How different would the squad look from the one that reached the round of 16 at Qatar 2022? Let's go position by position and see who is getting that call. 

Starting GK: Matt Turner Backups: Zack Steffen, Patrick Schulte Just missed out: Matt Freese, Diego Kochen

With just a year to go, Turner — the USMNT's starter since 2022 — still hasn't faced a serious challenge for his job despite his lack of regular playing time with Crystal Palace. Steffen was supposed to prove that at this month's Gold Cup, but hurt his knee and will miss the tournament. With Turner expected to find a new club where he'll be the No. 1 later this summer, he remains in pole position in goal for the next World Cup.

Upgrade from ‘22?: Yes. Turner now has World Cup and Premier League experience, something he didn't have four years back. And he wasn't starting at club level then, either. But a potential move from Crystal Palace to French club Lyon should give him time to increase his minutes.

Starting defense: Sergino Dest, Chris Richards, Miles Robinson, Antonee "Jedi" RobinsonBackups: Alex Freeman, Mark McKenzie, Joe Scally, Tim Ream, Walker ZimmermanJust missed out: Max Arfsten, Cameron Carter-Vickers, John Tolkin, Auston Trusty

Dest and Jedi are locks on the outside, if healthy. Same for center back Richards. But who will be Richards' partner in the middle come next summer? Right now, Miles Robinson is probably the front-runner by default. But that definitely could change between now and next June.

Upgrade from ‘22?: TBD. Jedi has certainly improved since Qatar, establishing himself as one of the best left backs in the Premier League. Amid a solid season with Crystal Palace that included winning an FA Cup, Richards is probably an upgrade over 2022 starter Zimmerman. But Ream was at the height of his powers in Qatar, and Dest has yet to return to full fitness since undergoing ACL surgery 13 months ago.

Holding midfielders: Tyler Adams, Weston McKennieBackups: Johnny Cardoso, Yunus Musah, Tanner Tessmann Just missed out: Gianluca Busio, Aidan Morris 

Adams and McKennie didn't have the best showing during March's Nations League finals, but Pochettino probably needs both stalwarts on the field if the Americans are to make a deep run next summer. That said, Cardoso could nudge one of those two to the bench if he continues to improve at pace — and if he can ever replicate his form in Spain's LaLiga while wearing the USA crest. 

Upgrade from ‘22?: Yes. While Adams has been plagued by injury throughout the 2026 cycle, he was excellent for Premier League side Bournemouth last season. At 27, he'll just be entering his prime next summer. The same goes for McKennie, who has been one of the best midfielders in Italy for two consecutive seasons with Juventus.

Attacking midfielder: Diego Luna Backup: Gio ReynaJust missed out: Jack McGlynn 

One of vanishingly few bright spots in March, Luna appears poised to be the USMNT's main playmaker during the Gold Cup with Reyna with Borussia Dortmund at the Club World Cup. Would Reyna be in this spot where he available? Maybe not, given his dearth of playing time with BVB last season. But we're expecting him to find a new club where he's able to feature regularly before the World Cup.

Upgrade from ‘22?: N/A. Gregg Berhalter didn't really have a playmaker in the middle four years ago; the then-USMNT coach paired Adams and McKennie with more of a box-to-box type in Yunus Musah. It showed, as the buildup to all three of the Americans' goals in Qatar began on the flanks.

Wingers: Tim Weah, Christian PulisicBackups: Brenden Aaronson, Malik Tillman, Haji WrightJust missed out: Paxten Aaronson, Damion Downs, Quinn Sullivan

Obvious on Pulisic. Another shoo-in starter when healthy, Weah should slide into the same role he manned in 2022 when he scored the Americans' first goal in Qatar. Aaronson spent last season in central midfield for Leeds United, but he's likely to return to the flank now that Leeds is back in the Premier League. Tillman can cement his USMNT with a strong Gold Cup showing and then another stellar campaign with Dutch champs PSV. Meantime, Wright — another World Cup goalscorer – can also fill in at striker. 

Upgrade from ‘22?: Yes. After the move to AC Milan, Pulisic is coming off the best two seasons of his career by far and could take another step forward in 2025-26. Meanwhile, Weah jumped up a level when he went from France's Lille to Juventus in 2023. He'll be even more experienced come next summer after participating in the FIFA Club World Cup and another UEFA Champions League campaign.

Striker: Ricardo PepiBackups: Folarin Balogun, Patrick Agyemang Just missed out: Josh Sargent, Brian White 

Pepi won the job late last year with a flurry of goals in Pochettino's first two camps, then continued his prolific ways for PSV before hurting his knee. Balogun, for whom injury prevented his participation under Pochettino at all, should return to the mix this season. Then there's Agyemang, who came almost out of nowhere to become a U.S. regular in 2025.

Upgrade from ‘22?: Yes. Berhalter started three different players in this spot four years ago. If Pepi picks up where he left off before injuring his knee in a Champions League match in Liverpool last winter— Pepi scored the winner before leaving the field  — the job should be his alone next summer. The rangy Texan's goals-to-minutes ratio has been off the charts in two seasons with PSV, for whom he's expected to start full-time his coming campaign.

Saudi-backed streaming superpower's TV deal for Fifa's global project is next expansionist step towards a world super league

“And what exactly are you doing here, sir?” To be fair, the border guard at Miami international airport made an excellent point. As ice-breakers go, frowning over the passports and visa tickers of the long-haul crowd on matchday minus four of the Fifa Club World Cup, the border guard was at least in tune with the zeitgeist. What is football doing here?

What are Lionel Messi, Trent Alexander-Arnold and the massed engines of the football-industrial complex doing hovering like an alien landing party over this fun, sinking sandbank of a city, a strip of land where the ocean seems to be punching a mulchy green hole in the asphalt every few miles, a place that from the air seems to be made entirely from deep-fried crumb, tropical weed and traffic?

And yes, the Fifa Club World Cup is only partly here at this point, glimpsed on highway billboards that also promote accident-chasing lawyers called things such as Chuck Flip-Burger III, still to emerge from the endless noise of the US's rolling leisure economy. But it is still an excellent question that deserves a proper answer.

Even the strangely literal-minded obsession with the trophy itself seems to admit to the vacant space at the heart of this thing. Never mind the basic sense of apathy. Here is a magnificent sinister golden plate that, at the turn of a key, can be transformed into a magnificent sinister golden sphere. Here is a trophy that seems to lurk, to tick and hum and buzz, that looks as if it almost certainly houses sinister things in its secret drawers – stolen moon rock, the head of a pigeon.

The question of what football is doing here is even present in the Club World Cup marketing. Dazn, Fifa's broadcast partner, is billing its breakthrough global event with the tagline Uncontested. It's a good word, meaning ultimate, the best; but also with a sense of something unmoored, floating out beyond any real sense of accountability.

Often the best way to explain something is to pick at a thread. As the clock ticks down to Saturday night's opener in Miami, as much of the pre-converted football world scratches its head at an event Gianni Infantino described this week as football's “big bang”, perhaps the most helpful thread is Dazn itself.

Need an explainer for the Infantino-shaped universe? Follow the football and you'll find the usual noses at the trough. Follow the money and who knows where you might end up. And Dazn is the money here.

It is no secret that the Club World Cup would not be happening in the way it is now happening without Dazn. In December 2024 Dazn offered Fifa a jaw-dropping $1bn (£787m) for the broadcast rights, all the more startling in a market that was, to that point, also Uncontested.

A month later Saudi Arabia concluded its own deal to buy a 10% stake in Dazn in return for – guess what – another $1bn. Two months after that Fifa announced its vast tournament prize fund, also, by coincidence, $1bn, thereby ensuring full compliance from its invited guests.

In the middle of this, around the time the soon-to-be-Saudi-part-owned Dazn was concluding its Fifa TV rights deal, Fifa awarded the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia via a show of Uncontested applause from its members, thereby completing what is no doubt an entirely illusory circle of hand-washing.

So far, so old school. We have a sense of this world now. It seems essentially untouchable, just the way power works. Strongman shall speak unto strongman. But there is another, more structurally vital way that Dazn tells the story of what is happening here, a process that may have a profound effect on the way football, sport, that thing you love, is made available from here.

This is a case of dramatic foreshadowing. Watch any of the huge number of Star Wars spin-off prequels in circulation and it soon becomes clear the key plot device is the slow reveal, titillating glimpses of the road to full Death Star. The senate is always in a state of uproar. The empire is creating a secret army on the cloud planet Garff. Known evil things – storm troopers, imperial fighters – are glimpsed in chillingly casual pose. An ambassador dressed in robes will stand on a doom-shadowed causeway and talk of plans for a mysterious new weapon. And as ever the mood is one of head-scratching distraction.

Perhaps in years to come it may be said that the greatest trick the Club World Cup pulled was convincing those who care about football's structures that it doesn't really exist, that this is a business model that can be defeated by not liking it or not following it, that will simply fade back into the swamp.

Whereas in reality the empire does have a powerful new weapon, one that is being winched into place in front of our eyes, that is already in play, already digging its fingers into domestic leagues, already unmooring the spectacle.

The best way to understand this is to tug again at the Dazn thread. The company was launched in 2015 by the billionaire Len Blavatnik, who made his fortune in Russian smelting and metal, and now, with ties to Russia cut, is the third-richest person in the UK. Dazn was billed as the Netflix of sports, as all ambitious tech entities must be the Netflix of something, its method to offer a simple, all-in streaming service for sports, shot through with betting, gaming, e-commerce, NFT stuff.

For a while it rumbled along in the background. The boxing partnership with Saudi Arabia was a step up into serious-player status. By 2023 Dazn had 20 million subscribers worldwide. The Fifa deal, aided in turn by Dazn's Saudi deal, is a company making its move.

And right now the big thing about Dazn, its superpower through all this, is that it is not actually a money-making entity in any sense of the phrase. Why else would anyone pay $1bn for rights to a product it then gives away for free? This is instead a means of taking a place at the table, a stake in the product, all the while happily swallowing vast losses. Dazn reportedly lost $1.4bn in 2023, up from $1.2bn the year before, all the while fearlessly expanding its footprint, happy to disrupt and take ownership.

In this sense it is essentially irresistible, all the more so with the backing of the world's greatest loss-leading sports propaganda project. And it has now found the perfect partner in Fifa, with its own expansionist aims, and also in the current generation of elite club ownership.

Everyone in football wants to find the next platform. It is a refrain at any gathering of leaders, owners and rainmakers. The long-term future of this sport is as an enabler, a source of cut-though, piggyback for some future global tech service, and from there access to the real Zuckerberg money.

Dazn and the Club World Cup is to some extent a trial run for this process, a way of shaking off the shackles of all those baffling legacy interests. Dazn has always denied ever having any interest in the beached European Super League, which was bound up in constructing exactly this kind of global broadcast platform. But now we have this instead, a World Super League, a product no one seems to like, but which Dazn believes will become the most live-streamed event in sports history, all cut through, all positioning, all future-building.

There is an overlap of style and ambition even in the way the Club World Cup will be presented. The marketing pitch is about individuals, leveraging the social media following of star players and the power of mass celebrity fawning. Even the shirts have been tinkered with and detribalised just a little on the grounds of creating a better optic for the six-inch screen in the world's pocket.

This is why Messi has been gerrymandered into place by Fifa, why the Dazn home screen is shot through with faces not badges, stars not clubs, why the Uncontested pitch is about goalscorers, top guns, names.

Even clicking on the homepage is a strangely gripping experience, like having your brain syringed through a small lighted screen crowded with endless shouted voices, from clips of Jude Bellingham admitting the Club World Cup is definitely a thing, to Dazn's Global Football Creator Program, based out of “a creator house” not far from Fifa HQ in Miami, which aims to “mobilize over 100 digital creators, reaching more than 32 million followers across platforms”.

Here it is, global reach, global cut-through, the “immersive, multi-platform experience” of Pêche Football, AT Frenchies, Lisa Zimouche, BFordLancer, Alex Ramos, Jessica Vincent, Jen Munoz, Mike WoZ, Shepmates, Fabrizio Romano. This is also why it doesn't really matter whether legacy fans love the Club World Cup, why talk of unsold tickets or a lack of competitive robustness seems to miss the point, stuck in the old metrics of value.

This has been billed by some as a trial run for the 2026 World Cup, as though what everyone here is really interested in is seeing if the stadiums work or the transport is any good. It feels more like a trial run for a version of the future.

The Club World Cup may pass in a haze this summer. Dazn may or may not last the course, may itself end up a beta version, planetary destructor ray Mk1. But the question of why football is here is not one that can be quietly ignored; not without that uncomfortable sense of a future that is already out there flexing its claws.

In this sense it is essentially irresistible, all the more so with the backing of the world's greatest loss-leading sports propaganda project. And it has now found the perfect partner in Fifa, with its own expansionist aims, and also in the current generation of elite club ownership.

Everyone in football wants to find the next platform. It is a refrain at any gathering of leaders, owners and rainmakers. The long-term future of this sport is as an enabler, a source of cut-though, piggyback for some future global tech service, and from there access to the real Zuckerberg money.

Dazn and the Club World Cup is to some extent a trial run for this process, a way of shaking off the shackles of all those baffling legacy interests. Dazn has always denied ever having any interest in the beached European Super League, which was bound up in constructing exactly this kind of global broadcast platform. But now we have this instead, a World Super League, a product no one seems to like, but which Dazn believes will become the most live-streamed event in sports history, all cut through, all positioning, all future-building.

There is an overlap of style and ambition even in the way the Club World Cup will be presented. The marketing pitch is about individuals, leveraging the social media following of star players and the power of mass celebrity fawning. Even the shirts have been tinkered with and detribalised just a little on the grounds of creating a better optic for the six-inch screen in the world's pocket.

This is why Messi has been gerrymandered into place by Fifa, why the Dazn home screen is shot through with faces not badges, stars not clubs, why the Uncontested pitch is about goalscorers, top guns, names.

Even clicking on the homepage is a strangely gripping experience, like having your brain syringed through a small lighted screen crowded with endless shouted voices, from clips of Jude Bellingham admitting the Club World Cup is definitely a thing, to Dazn's Global Football Creator Program, based out of “a creator house” not far from Fifa HQ in Miami, which aims to “mobilize over 100 digital creators, reaching more than 32 million followers across platforms”.

Here it is, global reach, global cut-through, the “immersive, multi-platform experience” of Pêche Football, AT Frenchies, Lisa Zimouche, BFordLancer, Alex Ramos, Jessica Vincent, Jen Munoz, Mike WoZ, Shepmates, Fabrizio Romano. This is also why it doesn't really matter whether legacy fans love the Club World Cup, why talk of unsold tickets or a lack of competitive robustness seems to miss the point, stuck in the old metrics of value.

This has been billed by some as a trial run for the 2026 World Cup, as though what everyone here is really interested in is seeing if the stadiums work or the transport is any good. It feels more like a trial run for a version of the future.

The Club World Cup may pass in a haze this summer. Dazn may or may not last the course, may itself end up a beta version, planetary destructor ray Mk1. But the question of why football is here is not one that can be quietly ignored; not without that uncomfortable sense of a future that is already out there flexing its claws.

With one eye on the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup in Brazil, U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes is planning to make some major changes to her roster.

Hayes recently teased changes ahead of their next game, and more details have now emerged. It comes after USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino took notes from his USWNT counterpart

Having only recently played both China and Jamaica in friendlies, winning 3-0 and 4-0 respectively, Hayes' side will return to action on June 26 and 29 when they host the Republic of Ireland.

However, Hayes does not intend to call up a full-strength squad, in an aim to rest most of her European-based stars, allowing them a well-earned break.

“We have certainly taken a few different perspectives for this upcoming camp, and we've left out the vast majority of players that are playing in Europe, bar one, and that's Naomi Girma,” Hayes recently told ESPN.

“But the rest of those players have been playing non-stop last two years without a summer break, and we think this is the only opportunity that they will get a much-needed break, and it will give us the chance to play players that are playing domestically.”

Girma will return for her second consecutive camp, with injuries having limited her to just seven appearances since joining Chelsea at the end of January, when she became the first ever $1 million women's player.

Reflecting on her decision to rest her European stars, Hayes explained it came down to a mixture of “performance and medical” factors.

“We wound back from the World Cup two years ago, then the Olympics, and players from Emily Fox, Lindsay Horan, they have had no off-season over two years, and in Europe, players play for 10 and a half, 11 months, and with those tournaments and the way that they take place in the late summer in football calendar meant that they were literally getting a week's break and going back into a full 11-month season,” she said.

“So, this is the first opportunity that we, and the only one, for them to take a break between now and the World Cup in two years, and player welfare and rest and recovery are also important for these players.”

One player set to make her long-awaited return to the USWNT lineup at the upcoming camp will be Gotham FC's Rose Lavelle, having now recovered after undergoing surgery on her ankle in December.

“When it comes to Rose, she's been out just over six months, so very much hope that she will be with us in camp, and she's had, as she calls it, a very lengthy layoff,” Hayes explained.

“I don't think Rose, you know, makes a really good injured player. She's bored, senseless. I think she's really looking forward not just to get back for Gotham.

“I think it was great for her to make an appearance at the weekend, but we miss her at the national team, we miss her experience and very much looking forward to her coming back.”

As for Trinity Rodman, who opted to step away from soccer in April in order to focus all of her attention on managing an ongoing back issue, Hayes does not expect to see her in the upcoming camp. However, it seems the Washington Spirit star is nearing a return to action.

“I think with Trinity, I don't think we will see her back this camp, but I expect her to return playing for Washington Spirit in July at some point,” Hayes said. “But of course she has to feel that her back's in a place that she can move beyond the pain that she's carried for a period of time, but she's in great spirits, and I know we're moving in the right direction with Trin.

“Both club and country have been working hard to get her to this stage, and like I said, I expect her to return to the NWSL in July at some point.”

HARRISON, N.J (June 12, 2025) – New York Red Bulls II have appointed former U.S. Men's National Team midfielder and Princeton, NJ native Michael Bradley as head coach, the club announced today. Bradley becomes the fourth head coach in franchise history.

Bradley began his coaching careering on October 24, 2023, when he was hired as an assistant coach of his father Bob Bradley's staff at Norwegian side Stabæk. The squad went 16-12-10 while he was on the staff. This will be his first professional head coaching position.

“We are excited to welcome Michael (Bradley) to the club,” said Sporting Director Julian de Guzman. “He had an incredible playing career and is one of the greatest American soccer players ever. We see him as a promising coaching talent and look forward to supporting his development as he transitions to a career behind the touchline.”

Bradley played professionally for 20 seasons, beginning his career with the Metrostars, when he was selected 36th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft at 16 years old. He was the youngest signing in club history at the time. The midfielder played two seasons with the club, making 32 appearances. He made his professional debut on April 2, 2005, against Real Salt Lake and scored his first career MLS goal in a 2-0 win over Chivas USA on October 16, 2005.

He would make the move across the pond in 2005, signing with Eredivisie side SC Heerenveen. In three seasons, he made 70 appearances tallying 19 goals and nine assists with the club. The midfielder then spent three seasons with Bundesliga side Borussia Monchengladbach from 2008 to 2011, where he was featured in 81 matches and scored 11 goals and dished out four assists. He followed this with a brief loan stint with Premier League's Aston Villa from 2010 to 2011. After Bradley moved to Serie A, joining Chievo Verona for two seasons in 2011 and 2012, and AS Roma for three seasons from 2012 to 2014. He made a combined 82 appearances between the two clubs.

The midfielder returned to MLS, signing with Toronto FC on January 13, 2014. In 10 seasons with Toronto, Bradley made 308 appearances scoring 19 goals and tallying 23 assists. His time in Toronto was filled with silverware, as he was a four-time Canadian Cup Winner (2016, 2017, 2018, 2020), 2017 MLS CUP Champion and 2017 Supporters' Shield Winner. Bradley would announce his retirement on October 21, 2023.

On the international stage, Bradley made the third-most appearances with the U.S Men's National Team with 151. He is one of three players to make a 150 or more appearances for the national team. He tallied 17 goals and 11 assists for his country. The midfielder made his debut on May 26, 2006, in a friendly match against Venezuela.

He has captained the United States for 44 matches and led the squad to a fourth-place finish in the 2016 Copa America Centenario. The midfielder has eight FIFA World Cup appearances. He most notably made four appearances in the 2010 FIFA World Cup scoring the game tying goal in a 2-2 Group Stage draw against Slovenia. The U.S. international made 40 FIFA World Cup Qualifier appearances and scored two goals in a 2-0 victory against Mexico on February 12, 2009. He also was a part of the 2009 Confederations Cup runner up squad, featuring in four matches.

In 2015, the midfielder made 18 appearances, scoring three goals and providing six assists for the national team and earned 2015 U.S. Soccer Player of the Year. Bradley dominated the CONCACAF Gold Cup, where he's made 25 career appearances scoring three goals and adding seven assists. He was named 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup Player of the Tournament and is a two-time CONCACAF Gold Cup winner in 2007 and 2017.

“I couldn't be more excited to come back to where my professional playing career began,” says Head Coach Michael Bradley. “This is a dream opportunity as a young coach. I'm looking forward to working everyday with this talented group of players, and I'll give everything to help them take the next step in their careers. I'm thankful to the club for the opportunity and can't wait to get started.”

His coaching staff will consist of Assistant Coach Daniel Gutierrez, Goalkeeper Coach Miguel Gutierrez, Athletic Trainer Arjend Emini, Strength and Conditioning Coach Hodong Cho and Video Analyst Liam Akhras.

Bradley's first match at the helm, will be on June 21 at Truist Point Stadium against Carolina Core FC with kickoff set for 7:30 p.m. ET and coverage available on MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.

GOAL ranks the top 25 players in this summer's FIFA Club World Cup, from Kylian Mbappe to Harry Kane and Lionel Messi

The FIFA Club World Cup is going to have it all: European champions, World Cup winners, Golden Boot winners, Golden Glove winners - individuals with accolades upon accolades.

The biggest names in world football are heading to the United States for nearly a month of high-stakes action, as 32 elite clubs battle for glory and a share of the staggering $1 billion prize pool. Every team is guaranteed a cut, but only one will lift the trophy.


Defending Club World Cup champions Manchester City return to defend their crown, joined by a powerhouse lineup that includes Real Madrid, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid, and Paris Saint-Germain - each stacked with global stars.


Fans can expect fireworks up front, with Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane, Julian Alvarez, and Ousmane Dembele all chasing the tournament's Golden Boot. Midfield maestros like Jude Bellingham, Rodri (the reigning Ballon d'Or winner), Moises Caicedo, Cole Palmer, and Vitinha will pull the strings in the center of the pitch, setting the stage for a thrilling summer showdown.

Perhaps the brightest performer of the 2024-25 campaign in Europe, Nuno Mendes, leads the way for defenders as well, but two of the world's best central defenders in Alessandro Bastoni and Ruben Dias, join him in the competition, too. Who could forget goalkeepers? Two of the best across Europe are taking their talents to the U.S., too.

The biggest question, though, is who sits where on the throne of the best that will be participating in this summer's marquee event?

GOAL ranks the top 25 players to watch in the tournament.

Chargers' head coach Jim Harbaugh tells Fox News Digital what he looks forward to about next year's World Cup.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is just under one year away, and Los Angeles Chargers' head coach Jim Harbaugh is already looking forward to it. 

There are 16 stadiums in 16 different host cities, and one of those is SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. The Chargers play their home games in SoFi Stadium, and Harbaugh said he is looking forward to the "vibe" the tournament will bring.

"I'm just looking forward to the vibe, I'm looking forward to what I see on TV. It brings people together, you roll out that pelota, you roll out that ball, and all cultural barriers are broken," Harbaugh told Fox News Digital.

"To see all the different countries coming to our city, just to imagine what it's going to be like. Just those gatherings, those tens of thousands of people that gather and the way they support their team, because that's when the magic happens. It happens in real time, it happens when the crowd's there and the crowds are so into it."

Harbaugh said he is also looking forward to watching competition "at its highest level." 

The 61-year-old coach is also looking forward to the impact the World Cup will have on not only the host city, but also the country.

"What I look forward to, and it's going to do for our country and our city. I've seen it before, World Cup in the United States in the '90s. The ‘94 US (men's) team, just how the sport exploded after that, so I look forward to all those things."

Last season was Harbaugh's first season as the Chargers head coach, as he left Michigan after he led them to a National Championship win in the 2023-2024 season.

The Chargers went 11-6 in Harbaugh's first season at the helm and made it to the playoffs. They were bounced in the AFC Wild Card round by the Houston Texans 32-12.

Harbaugh said his team is "back to work" with the goal of winning a Super Bowl in mind. 

"There is only one happy team in the NFL, that's the Philadelphia Eagles, just 'cause they won the Super Bowl," Harbaugh said. "The rest of us are disappointed, and the rest of us are back to work, we are chasing that Super Bowl. To be called World Champions, that is our goal."

Alejandro Moreno speaks on LAFC's journey to the Club World Cup and the challenges they will face in the tournament. (0:51)

The FIFA Club World Cup and the Concacaf Gold Cup, which are both being held in the United States, kick off Saturday and will look a little different with a few laws having been tweaked.

Those two competitions, plus the UEFA European Under-21 Championship finals, which started Wednesday, and the UEFA Women's Euros, kicking off on July 2, will be played with the new regulations.

In addition, FIFA is trying out the latest enhancements to its semi-automated offside technology, and testing cameras placed on a referee's headset to give fans a new perspective on the game.

What should we expect to see, and what does it all mean?

We know the situation. A shot comes in or a corner is floated over, and the goalkeeper first flops on the ground for 10 seconds. Then he stands up, surveys his options, and looks around. Maybe then he'll release the ball, though after some 30 seconds have been lost. Spread that across a game, and it can have a real effect on a match.

It's been a bug-bear of supporters for quite a while. A tactic most often by used by away teams trying to protect a lead in a difficult match, it has evolved somewhat to become part of a team's tactics simply to frustrate the opposition.

The old law, which said a keeper should release within six seconds or be penalized with a free kick, hadn't been applied for many years. Now the keeper will get eight seconds, but with a clear punishment process thereafter.

Once a goalkeeper has control of the ball, they will have eight seconds to release the ball. The referee will raise his arm to indicate there are five seconds left. If the ball hasn't been released, a corner will be awarded.

Fans will be skeptical it won't just go the same way as the old law, the difference being there is now a hand signal which the referee is bound to.

Trials were held throughout the 2024-25 season in Premier League 2 (academies) and in Maltese and Italian football. Across over 400 games only three corners were awarded -- 3 in England and 0 in Malta. In Italy, a different trial was held which led to the award of a throw, which was penalized once.

Since the IFAB approved the change to the law, it's already been adopted in the professional game in South America, in the CONMEBOL Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana -- its version of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. In 160 fixtures to date, only two corners have been awarded. Boston River goalkeeper Bruno Antúnez conceded a corner at Independiente when he took too long assessing his options, and the whistle blew just before he took a long punt upfield.

Pierluigi Collina, FIFA's head of referees, insists the aim is not to try to penalize goalkeepers, but to encourage the flow of the game. He doesn't expect the law to be applied super strictly, but a goalkeeper laying on the ball for no good reason will be looked upon dimly.

"I don't think that any spectator likes the goalkeeper keeping the ball within the hands for such a long time," Collina said. "So [we gave them] a couple of seconds more because they may need this time to get teammates reshaped on the field. But they have to know that once the time is over, the eight seconds is over, the referee will enforce the law.

"We are confident that there won't be many corner kicks awarded. We are confident that the goalkeepers will respect the limit of eight seconds.

"The objective of this law is not to punish the goalkeepers. So referees will be a bit flexible when the goalkeeper has the need to recover from, say, a demanding save. But there is no need to fall down on the ground. This is only something to waste time."

There will be no yellow card for an infringement, just the corner.

Julián Álvarez was "incredulous" after his penalty kick was disallowed in Atlético Madrid's Champions League round-of-16 defeat to Real Madrid in March. The Argentina international had accidentally touched the ball twice when taking the kick, with the VAR stepping in to cancel the goal. Atletico boss Diego Simeone still hasn't got over it.

Earlier this month, the IFAB announced a "clarification" to law, after it had been lobbied by UEFA.

As is often the case, it takes a high-profile incident to force change. After all, no one remembers Aleksandar Mitrovic's disallowed penalty for Fulham against Newcastle United in January 2023, do they? The circumstances were the same, with the Serbia international scoring a penalty via touching the ball twice after slipping in his run up.

Yet within weeks of the controversial Álvarez incident, the law has been rewritten.

Footage provided by UEFA shows Julián Alvarez making "minimal" contact with the ball for his penalty during Atlético Madrid's Champions League defeat to Real Madrid.

Referees the world over have also treated any double touch on a penalty as an offence, even if accidental. Now the IFAB says that's never really been the true intention, and it should only apply to a deliberate second touch, like the ball coming off the post, and not the ball being kicked against the standing foot.

So from now on, in the rare case that the VAR identifies such a offence and the ball goes into the net, it will be a retake. If the player misses, the referee should give a free kick to the opposition (or it stays as a miss in a shootout).

Collina explained: "We thought that this should have been clarified because the double touch was intended to be related to something done deliberately. We decided it was better to clarify by adding two separate scenarios one when it's still deliberate and the other one when it is accidental.

"I think in this way the spirit of the game and the spirit of the Laws of the Game are respected."

Is it the end of the delayed offside flag? Only in some limited situations.

After holding trials during the Intercontinental Cup in December, FIFA is ready to roll out offside tech that's supposed to stop delayed offside flags when they aren't necessary, such as the one which led to an injury Nottingham Forest's Taiwo Awoniyi last month. The striker was clearly offside, and play should not have continued.

It will most often be used when there's one player running through on goal. The assistant will get an audio message in their earpiece which says "offside, offside."

So what's a clear offside? The tech will be activated when a player is 10 centimeters or more offside. Only when that player touches the ball will the assistant receive the alert, and play will immediate be halted by the flag.

FIFA reckons it could be useful four or five times per game, but we're yet to see full data.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

FIFA's higher-grade SAOT, which features a chip in the ball, enables it to make instant decisions on the kick point both of the pass and the offside player.

"We have in each stadium 16 tracking cameras, we have the sensor inside the ball and they're using artificial intelligence," said Johannes Holzmüller., FIFA's director of innovation. "The system then notifies the assistant referees directly so that the assistant referees can immediately flag for offsite.

"Everything above 10 centimeters, we call it high confidence, then this is sent directly to the assistant. Everything below this threshold will go anyway to the VAR because we call it very close offsite incident.

Collina added: "The assistant referees were told in case of doubt, keep the flag down because if you raise the flag, you kill everything including the possibility that the VAR can help you. Keeping the flag down, you give the technology the possibility to support you. Probably they went a bit farther, so what was doubt became bigger and bigger and bigger.

"We have reminded our assistant referees to be a bit braver, more courageous. When the offside is two meters offside, it cannot lead to a doubt."

Get ready for a whole new view of the game: as the referee sees it.

Refs will wear a camera fixed to their headsets, with the footage immediately available to DAZN, the competition broadcaster.

But don't get any ideas about pressing a button and switching to "ref cam." Live footage cannot be shown, except before the game in the tunnel or during the coin toss.

We can expect to see goals from the referee's perspective, but alas we won't be shown controversial incidents. At least at first, that is.

It's described more as an entertainment add-on. It may evolve as the tournament progresses, perhaps around penalty incidents, but don't expect too much too soon.

However, it's unlikely to be used in VAR reviews.

"All footage which is available to viewers has to be available to the video match officials," Collina explained. "Otherwise the system would not work. Imagine that all the world has access to footage and the video match officials do not.

"So basically everything is public, or can become public, has to be available also to VAR. So I would say yes and no. Yes, but in reality it is no. Can you believe that a camera position just besides the referee's eyes can see something that the referee's eyes cannot? Honestly, I think it's difficult to believe. So basically yes and no. Yes it can be used but no it won't be used."

Fans inside stadiums at the Club World Cup will be able to watch on the big screen what the VAR is shown the referee at the pitchside monitor.

However, the audio of the conversation between referee and VAR will remain behind the cloak of secrecy.

This already happens in the Australian A-League, so FIFA is jumping on the back of that. But it seems to be of limited value if there is no context to the pictures.

Referees will also announce the outcome of a VAR review over the stadium public addresses system and to TV viewers, which we've seen in several competitions -- first tried at the 2023 Women's World Cup.

"TV spectators can listen to the referee explaining first the background of the decision, and why he or she's taking a decision," Collina explained. "And then at the very end, the final decision taken; very simple, very straightforward.

"I think it can bring transparency and clarity to what the referee does on the field of play."

A more simple change, which covers the ball hitting the referee.

In the old wording of the law, if the ball hit the ref, then the dropped ball would go to the team who were last in possession of the ball. Now, it's about who would take possession.

Usually, this is a pass between teammates so there will be no difference. But if it's very clear that the play of the ball was going to the opposition, then the opposition gets the dropped ball.

In most cases we are likely to see the referee err on the side of caution and give the dropped ball to the team who made the pass, as it would need to be beyond doubt a change of possession was going to take place.

In the Champions League in the 2024-25 season, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta grabbed the ball before it had gone out of play in a match at Internazionale. A direct free kick was awarded and Arteta was booked, but by the Laws of the Game he should have been sent off. But most leagues have been dealing with this with a caution, as a red card was seen as too harsh for such a minor infringement.

And here's the change: If a coach picks the ball up while it's in play, and it was no more than an attempt to get play moving again, it will be no sanction (not even a caution) and an indirect free kick.

But trying to stop the opponent from restarting play will remain a red-card offence.

This has already been seen in various competitions, but was officially added to the Laws of the Game this summer.

It's supposed to prevent a referee from being crowded by players. While this might be easier to apply in short competitions like the Club World Cup and Gold Cup, it has proved to be more challenging in a 380-game domestic seasons.

MIAMI – One unique way the FIFA Club World Cup will appeal to fans this summer is the introduction of the referee camera, which will provide viewers with point-of-view action they've never seen before watching soccer games.

FIFA referees will wear tiny cameras on the sides of their heads, connected to a microphone and transmitter that will send the video to DAZN – the company broadcasting all 63 Club World Cup matches for free on its app and website.

The video will also be shown inside six NFL stadiums during Club World Cup games so fans can experience the referee's decision-making process and enhance transparency during on-field reviews.

Sports fans are typically accustomed to seeing cameras zoom in on referees making announcements during NFL and NBA games, while MLB fans have recently experienced the home-plate umpire's point of view from cameras on their facemask.

If it goes well, maybe referee cameras could infiltrate the viewing experience in other sports.

“The main purpose is to offer the TV viewers a new experience," FIFA Referees Committee chairman Pierluigi Collina told USA TODAY Sports this week during a Club World Cup referee training session in Miami.

Referees will place customized molded earpieces into their right ears, then watch a screen as they adjust and tighten their cameras to the ideal angle for capturing the action.

Two wires – one for the camera and the other for a microphone – will be clipped on the back collar either on the referee's uniform or an undershirt. And the transmitter, called a ballpack, will be placed in their shorts' pocket.

FIFA tested several cameras, including some at chest level, but felt the side of the ear resulted in the best perspective. It offers a direct line of sight of the referees, especially when they turn their heads – something that wouldn't be offered if they wore a body camera on their chest.

“We were thinking about what's the best way to attach the camera,” said German referee Nicolas Winter, whose idea has come to life for the Club World Cup and could be employed by FIFA for other matches in the future. “For us, it was important to have the original point of view of the referee because when you have a body cam and move your head to the right or left, you never really have the original point of view.”

Added FIFA Director of Innovation Johannes Holzmuller: "If we replicate the referee view, it should really be 100% what the referee is looking at.”

FIFA announced its referee cameras late last week, sharing a video of Pachuca's Oussama Idrissi dribbling around several defenders to score a goal in their win against Botafogo in a FIFA Intercontinental Cup match last December.

The referee's camera captured the player receiving a pass from his teammate in the penalty area, the player's creative playmaking before firing the shot, the roar of the crowd and defenders helplessly looking up at the referee after the score.

“The view from the referee's camera was amazing,” Collina said. “It's interesting.”

Holzmuller says the video transmitted will be in 1080i quality, sent over a private 5G network so DAZN and the stadiums can use the video.

Referees have worn the devices during their training sessions to get used to their ear molds, which aim to make the wearing experience more comfortable for them.

The referees will also have assistance putting on their camera devices before matches to ensure they are recording as soon as matches begin.

“From there, it goes live on air,” Holzmuller said.

FIFA will use the findings from the Club World Cup to create guidelines and explore the use of them in future matches. It's possible it could be a mainstay for soccer broadcasts – including next year's FIFA World Cup.

Along with improving the fan experience, the referee cameras could also help them improve their craft.

“I was sitting at home on my couch seven years ago, thinking about how to improve refereeing,” Winter said.

“We have 30+ camera angles in a top match, but we can never see our own perspective after a match again. It's really helpful for us to analyze matches – like our positioning, for example. But I think it's good to give the audience and spectators a more transparent view, so they can understand what it means to be a referee.

“Of course, we are all human. We all make mistakes. But I think it's always good to show everyone the way decision making works.”

NWSL

Summer Transfer

Window

OL Lyonnes have expressed serious interest in 18-year-old Ajax and U.S. women's national team midfielder Lily Yohannes, according to multiple sources briefed on the team's discussions, who wished to remain anonymous due to the ongoing nature of the talks.

The eight-time Champions League winners from France and the Dutch club are in talks over a potential summer transfer. Yohannes, who signed with Ajax in April 2023, is under contract until June 2026.

Both clubs declined to comment on the discussions.

While ESPN previously reported that Women's Super League champions Chelsea were interested in signing the breakout star, a source with knowledge of the situation said the talks are currently focused on Lyon. However, a deal has not yet been finalized.

In 2023, at 16 years old, Yohannes made history as the youngest player to start a UEFA Champions League group stage match, contributing to Ajax's 2-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in November of that year.

Though she has lived in Amsterdam with her family since she was 10 years old and has played her entire professional career there, Yohannes is a U.S. citizen, born in Springfield, Virginia. She had the option of representing the Dutch women's national team, but last year announced her decision to commit to the U.S.

Yohannes was first called into the USWNT for the SheBelieves Cup in March 2024; however, she did not see minutes on the field. She made her debut three months later when head coach Emma Hayes called her in for a pair of friendlies against South Korea in June. Ten minutes after subbing on in the second half of their June 4 meeting, Yohannes scored her first goal for the U.S. (Due to their nature as international friendlies, Yohannes was not cap-tied for competing.)

Since declaring for the U.S., Yohannes has played in the 2025 SheBelieves Cup and four other friendlies this year: two against Brazil in April, and in the USWNT's most recent friendlies against China on May 31 and Jamaica on June 3.

Hayes has continually spoken highly of Yohannes, who celebrated her 18th birthday on Thursday, and has made clear her intentions to invest in her growth as a young player.

“The next two years of development will be important for her. I think it's been an unbelievable development pathway for her to be at Ajax,” Hayes said recently, noting the team's style has “advanced her positional play in a way that I think makes her stand out beyond her years.”

Hayes has been equally clear about her patience with Yohannes as she grows into her career, saying, “she's got unbelievable maturity and coachability and [is] someone who I know is going to become an important part of our program, but I'm invested in that development, and we have to be patient with that considering her tender age and her lack of international and high level experience.”

OL Lyonnes, one of the most decorated and dominant teams in women's football, recently underwent a rebrand in name and crest under owner Michele Kang, who acquired the club in 2024 and announced, along with the club's new crest, the construction of a performance center designed for female athletes. The team will also play its matches at the 59,000-seat Groupama Stadium next season. 

The club has also announced major personnel moves to further strengthen its team, which was a Champions League semi-finalist this season and Premiére Ligue champions for the eighteenth time. With the departure of former OL Lyonnes manager Joe Montemurro, who accepted a head coaching job with the Australian women's national team, Washington Spirit's Jonathan Giraldez has stepped in, leaving the DC club after less than two years. 

On June 4, OL Lyonnes announced the signing of French striker Marie-Antoinette Katoto, who will join the club after 10 years with PSG's senior team, adding one of the most prolific strikers in the women's game to a frontline that already includes Melchie Dumornay, Tabitha Chawinga, and Kadidiatou Diani.

Which team and country has won the most titles? Who is the record goal scorer? Al Jazeera looks back at the tournament.

The 21st edition of the FIFA Club World Cup is set to roll out in the United States on Saturday, June 14, as Lionel Messi-led Inter Miami host Egyptian club Al Ahly in Miami, Florida.

The tournament's changed-up and expanded format has been subject to debate and criticism, but FIFA and its chief Gianni Infantino remain optimistic about its future as the premier club competition.

Its history, although relatively short, is littered with illustrious champions from across the world.

Here's a look back at the 25-year history of the tournament:

The inaugural edition was an all-Brazilian affair as the country's top two clubs – Corinthians and Vasco da Gama – contested the final, which was hosted at Rio de Janeiro's historic cauldron, the Maracana Stadium, on January 14, 2000.

Corinthians emerged victorious as the game ended goalless after extra time and a dramatic penalty shootout saw them win 4-3.

Famous players including Romario (Brazil), Nicolas Anelka (France), Raul (Spain) and Dwight Yorke (Trinidad and Tobago) were part of the tournament.

The tournament was halted for five years due to FIFA's troubles with finding marketing and broadcast partners.

Upon its resumption in 2005, the Samba Boys once again went on to win the following two editions.

Sao Paulo beat Liverpool 1-0 in the December 2005 final in Yokohama, Japan, and Internacional beat Barcelona a year later with the same scoreline at the same venue.

It took the star-studded AC Milan team of the 2000s to break the Brazilian hold on the tournament as Kaka, Filippo Inzaghi, Alessandro Nesta and co beat Argentina's Boca Juniors 4-2 in Yokohama to take the title to Italy.

The following years saw Manchester United (2008), Barcelona (2009 and 2011) and Inter Milan (2010) keep the title within Europe.

Corinthians returned to the fore with their second title in a low-scoring tournament that ended with a 1-0 scoreline in the final between the Brazilian side and the then-European champions Chelsea.

Spain's two biggest clubs – Barcelona and Real Madrid – reigned supreme in the 2010s and early 2020s as they shared six of the 11 titles won by European teams during that period.

Germany's Bayern Munich were crowned twice, in 2013 and 2020, and the rest of the three titles were won by three different English clubs.

Real Madrid has won five titles.

The Los Blancos won their first Club World Cup trophy in 2014 and then went on a treble-winning spree from 2016 to 2018.

Their most recent win came in 2022, when they beat Saudi club Al Hilal 5-3 in the final in Morocco.

Cristiano Ronaldo has represented two teams – Manchester United and Real Madrid – and has scored the most goals, seven, in his eight games at the tournament.

FIFA chief Infantino tempted Ronaldo to add to his tally by switching to a Club World Cup 2025 participant team from Al Nassr, but the Portuguese superstar wouldn't have it.

Pep Guardiola has won the trophy on four occasions with three different clubs. He was the manager of the famous “tiki-taka” Barcelona side of the late 2000s and early 2010s that won the title in 2009 and 2011.

Guardiola then took his golden touch to Germany's Bayern Munich, with whom he won in 2013. And finally, in 2023, the Spanish manager took his Manchester City team to their first Club World Cup title.

Among the other players on the list, Messi and his Inter Miami teammate Luis Suarez have scored five goals each. Both have the chance to add to their respective tallies and surpass Ronaldo in the 2025 edition.

Spain. The two La Liga giants have won eight titles between them.

Brazil and England are second on the list with four titles each, while Germany and Italy have two apiece.

Jack Grealish has 'broken his silence' after being left out of Manchester City's squad for the Club World Cup.

The 29-year-old was not named from Pep Guardiola's squad for the United States after his lack of minutes in the Premier League over recent months.

As a result, his exclusion was not a significant surprise when the squad was announced, particularly as City have completed the signings of outfield players Rayan Ait Nouri, Rayan Cherki and Tijjani Reijnders this week.

Advert

Grealish has been linked with a move away from City throughout 2025.

And on Wednesday, Football Insider reported that Grealish 'favours' a move to fellow Premier League club Everton, who are moving into their new stadium and have money to spend this summer.

The same outlet claims that Grealish has 'accepted' that he will have to sign for a new club after being deemed surplus to requirements at the Etihad Stadium.

England manager Thomas Tuchel stated earlier this week that Grealish would need to play much more regularly if he was to get back in his squad.

Advert

He said: "To go every three days and get better and better with every minute that he has in his legs. That's what is missing, nothing else."

Now, the Three Lions international has broken his silence.

Taking to Instagram, Grealish simply posted a video of the Manchester City winger at sea while on holiday - seemingly indicating that he is taking time to think about his future.

Advert

It isn't entirely clear as to when Grealish and other City outcasts, such as Kyle Walker, will return to training with their clubs.

The Club World Cup concludes on July 13 - just over a month before the Premier League season gets underway on the weekend of August 16.

Whether or not Grealish has a new club to kick-start the season by then remains to be seen.

More than two weeks after Christian Pulisic asked U.S. men's national team coach Mauricio Pochettino for permission to skip this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup, the AC Milan star finally opened up about his decision – and revealed that he wanted to be with the USMNT for it's two pre-Gold Cup friendlies, a request that was denied by Pochettino and his staff. 

"Obviously, it sucks for me to miss out with the team," Pulisic told former U.S. players Jimmy Conrad, Charlie Davies and Tony Meola on Thursday on their CBS Sports podcast. "I want to be a part of the team always. 

"Towards the end of the season, my body just started talking to me, and my mind, and then I started to think ‘what is going to be best for me leading into next year and going into the World Cup?'," he continued. "Was that to play eight more games and then get no rest at all, go straight into preseason [with Milan] and then grind another year and go straight into the World Cup? That's not what I felt was best for my body." 

But Pulsic was willing to join the USMNT for FIFA's June international window, during which the U.S. hosted European foes Türkiye and Switzerland, the world's 27th and 20th-ranked teams, and then take a break after that. Pochettino could've used him. 

"I did want to be a part of at least the two friendlies," Pulisic said. "I did speak with the coaches, and then I asked, and I wanted to be a part of the team and whatever capacity I could. And they said no. They said they only wanted one roster. 

"And that's the coach's decision," he added. "I fully respect that. I didn't understand it, but it is what it is."

With Pulisic watching from home, the Americans lost both matches, including a 4-0 drubbing by the Swiss in Nashville on Tuesday. "The results have been tough, for sure," he said. "It was difficult to watch the last game."

Pulisic struggled with soft-tissue injuries early in his career, but he has played 100 games for the Rossoneri over the last two European seasons. He said that his desire to be at his peak next June, when the U.S., Canada and Mexico host the first 48-team World Cup, influenced his thinking about this summer. 

"I had to make the best decision for myself and, in the long run for my [national] team," he said. "Even though, clearly, some people haven't seen it."

Pulisic has faced significant criticism for skipping the Gold Cup, partly because he hadn't – until Thursday – provided an explanation himself. Some of that blow-back has come from former national team players, most notably Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey, the joint-top scorers in USMNT history. Pulisic's father even responded publicly to Donovan, who is now an analyst with FOX Sports.

"It's tough because I looked up to those guys growing up," Pulsiic said. "Some of these guys were my idols, and I respect them so much as players. And it's tough, especially when you know some of them as well. Privately, the way they talk to me and clearly want to show support, and, be your friend and everything. And then they say something slightly different publicly. And that's, that's fine. It doesn't hurt me. Am I surprised by it? I don't know, not really. People are always going to have their opinions."

Still, he took issue with anyone who is skeptical of his dedication to the USMNT. 

"To question my commitment, especially towards the national team, in my opinion that's that's way out of line," Pulisic said. "I've never missed a game in all my years in the national team due to anything but an injury. I want to be there at all times. Sometimes you have to make decisions.

 "This is the right decision, like I said, for myself and for the team. At the end of the day, people will see that."

CORAL GABLES, FL — FIFA president Gianni Infantino believes the Club World Cup opener with Lionel Messi's Inter Miami and Egpytian side Al Ahly at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday, June 14 will be “full” and “packed” with fans.

Infantino didn't quite say sell out. But he's taking news of slow ticket sales in stride.

Although ticket sales have not met FIFA's expectations in the final week before the new tournament begins, Infantino thinks soccer fans in the United States should take advantage of the opportunity to watch 32 of the best soccer club teams in the world in the 11 cities where matches will be played this summer.

“I think this is the important element that people have to really capture now – be part of history,” Infantino said during a Club World Cup event at FIFA's headquarters near Miami on May 10.

“Football is such an important sport all over the world. We'll have billions of people watching this Club World Cup from home, who would love to come and to attend. And we'll have millions who are here, and who will be able to be part of this very first FIFA Club World Cup, which will enter into history. So, I think it's great.”

Some Club World Cup ticket prices have been lowered significantly thanks to dynamic pricing – a mechanism used to lower or raise ticket prices based on demand. The cheapest tickets to half of the Club World Cup group stage matches (24 of 48) are under $36 all-in with fees before taxes.

FIFA has a $2 billion revenue target it expects to generate from the Club World Cup – which includes $1 billion already paid by DAZN to live stream all 63 matches for free on their website and app, and another $500 million in marketing rights. The other $500 million will come from hospitality rights and ticket sales.

Along with the $1 billion prize pool that will be paid by FIFA and divided among the 32 Club World Cup teams, FIFA is targeting to make $250 million in solidarity payments to other clubs and leagues around the world to further the game. FIFA also plans to pay each host city $1 million to support community soccer projects in the future.

When FIFA announced its unprecedented prize pool for the Club World Cup in March, it also said it will not retain any profits from the tournament.

While previous editions of the Club World Cup predominantly featured seven teams, FIFA hopes the expanded 2025 Club World Cup sets a new standard for club soccer globally and can become a tournament held every four years one year before World Cups.

“As for every new venture that anyone tries to create in the world, there are always discussions that you never really know what will happen. … For us, the important element is to fill the stadiums, to give opportunities to people to come,” Infantino said.

“We were lucky enough – and this is also something that we did not expect in that measure – that we got great attention from sponsors and brokers broadcasters so that when it comes to revenues, everything is perfectly secured.”

The Club World Cup will host matches in Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, Nashville, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington D.C. The final is July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Wednesday marks one year until the next World Cup begins on June 11, 2026. That event will be co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

FIFA Club World Cup

Club World Cup

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) authority has removed a controversial social media post highlighting its upcoming security presence around the upcoming Club World Cup after direct contact from FIFA expressing concerns.

Last Friday, the CBP announced on its Facebook page and other social channels that its agents would be “suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games” while noting that the tournament begins at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium this Saturday.

According to sources familiar with the conversations, speaking anonymously due to their sensitive nature, the post, which attracted thousands of interactions, was deleted after senior personnel from FIFA expressed concerns to the CBP about the reaction it had provoked.

With President Trump's administration having made deportations and a clampdown on illegal immigration key objectives, the post sparked a wave of media and public attention, heightening concerns that fans may be deterred from attending games due to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and CBP presence.

Following contact from FIFA, CBP removed the post. It is unclear the extent to which FIFA's outreach influenced the decision to remove the post, but this episode shows that FIFA are becoming concerned about the potential perception for fans attending the tournament both this year and at next year's World Cup.

FIFA declined to comment when approached by The Athletic.

In a statement sent to The Athletic on Wednesday morning, a CBP Spokesperson said: “U.S. Customs and Border Protection is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the FIFA Club World Cup is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the Super Bowl. Our mission remains unchanged.”

Thomas Kennedy of the Florida Immigrant Coalition told South Florida's NBC6 previously that the messaging used by the CBP in the post was “a bit cryptic, it's sort of alluding that people should have their paperwork in order to attend the games.” Kennedy added that it may make potential fans “less likely to come watch the games because of just sheer intimidation.”

CBP professionals are sometimes present at major sporting events, according to the organization, in order to help detect and respond to threats and criminal activity. The organization's Air and Marine Operations will also be involved to enforce temporary flight restrictions around stadiums during matches.

ICE agents will also be at Club World Cup games, as part of the overall security operation.

FIFA president Gianni Infantino brushed the controversy aside earlier this week, telling reporters: “No, I don't have any concerns about anything in the sense that we are very attentive on any security question, of course the most important for us is to guarantee security for all the fans who come to the games, this is our priority.”

FIFA has taken active steps to boost its promotional efforts for the opening games after the initial uptake of tickets was slow.

Local college students in the Miami area have been given the opportunity to buy five tickets for just $20 for Saturday's clash between Lionel Messi's Inter Miami and Egyptian club Al-Ahly.

President Donald Trump's immigration enforcers are set to be deployed at the FIFA Club World Cup Games to provide security at the soccer tournament.

"Let the games begin! The first FIFA Club World Cup games start on June 14th in Miami... CBP will be suited and booted and ready to provide security for the first round of games," U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) wrote in a since-deleted post on social media.

Newsweek has reached out the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for comment.

President Donald Trump's administration is carrying out plans to deport millions of immigrants as part of his key campaign pledge. ICE agents have been thrust into the forefront of the national conversation surrounding immigration enforcement. The agency has been granted expanded powers to conduct arrests in sensitive locations such as schools, hospitals and churches.

A spokesperson for CBP told Newsweek: "U.S. Customs and Border Protection is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the FIFA Club World Cup 26 is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the Super Bowl. Our mission remains unchanged."

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is also expected to be at the games, according to local Miami news outlet NBC 6 South Florida and The Athletic.

ICE issued a warning to attendees and said people should carry proof of their legal status, NBC 6 reported.

CBP personnel are occasionally deployed to major sporting events to help identify and respond to potential threats and criminal activity, according to the agency. Additionally, its Air and Marine Operations will assist in enforcing temporary flight restrictions around stadiums during the matches.

The truth behind a Chelsea star's omission from their Club World Cup squad has come to light and it is seriously exciting for West Ham.

West Ham can only watch on with envy at Chelsea's ravenous ambition in the transfer market.

While the Hammers insist they can only spend a percentage of any money they raise through sales, money is no object for the Blues.

There could be an upside to Chelsea's latest squad improvement exercise for West Ham, though.

Hammers chief David Sullivan is banking on Mohammed Kudus bringing in the most significant funds to pay for Graham Potter's rebuild.

Potter has it all to prove at the London Stadium after an inauspicious first 19 games in charge following his return to football 20 months after being sacked by Chelsea.

But the 50-year-old is working in a completely different financial landscape at West Ham than he was at Stamford Bridge.

Shipping out Kudus and a number of others for decent fees will dictate what Potter can do in the summer transfer window, which reopens on Monday.

West Ham have held talks with Chelsea over a possible deal for Kudus.

The Blues are said to be still mulling over signing Kudus from the Hammers – but their move for Jamie Gittens – which is expected to be resurrected next week – suggests that may not happen.

A number of Chelsea players were floated to West Ham when talks were held about Kudus.

There has not been much to shout about for the Hammers in the early knockings of this vital window.

But there might be now.

Because the real reason a Chelsea star is not in their Club World Cup squad is seriously exciting for West Ham.

One of the players who came up during talks between the Hammers and Chelsea was goalkeeper Robert Sanchez.

Sanchez worked with Potter at Brighton and the Hammers need a replacement for released veteran Lukasz Fabianski while high-earning £120k per week Alphonse Areola is also being linked with a move to Espanyol.

Nothing came of those initial talks.

But there was an interesting development earlier this week when it was reported Chelsea have now decided they will sell Sanchez or Djordje Petrovic this summer.

That gives West Ham the choice of two goalkeepers – Petrovic being the much more attractive option given he is still only 25 and was named player of the year on loan at Chelsea's sister club Strasbourg.

Previously it was expected Chelsea would want to hang on to the big Serbian.

But the report outlined Chelsea plan to sell one of Sanchez or Petrovic – and now there's been a major development.

After missing out on Caoimhin Kelleher to Bournemouth and not being in the mix to sign Kepa before Arsenal made a move, bagging a top young ‘keeper like Petrovic would be a superb way to start West Ham's window business.

And Petrovic is there on a silver platter for Sullivan and co after an update from journalist Matt Law.

In an exclusive for The Telegraph, Law claims Petrovic was not snubbed by Enzo Maresca for the Club World Cup squad.

In actual fact he asked to be left out so he can focus on sorting out a permanent move away from Chelsea.

It gets even better for West Ham and their plans to replace Fabianski and sign a new number one. 

Because Petrovic's main aim when sorting his move is to ensure he is the first choice goalkeeper.

Many West Ham fans were not keen on Sanchez given some of the difficulties he has experienced at Stamford Bridge.

But while Chelsea mull over whether to follow up their interest in AC Milan and France star Mike Maignan, Law claims the club have reiterated their faith in Sanchez and fellow Blues goalkeepers Filip Jorgensen and Mike Penders.

All three have been included in the Club World Cup squad.

That means West Ham now have the very realistic possibility of signing Petrovic.

The only thing stopping a deal is the cash to pay the first instalment.

But if the Hammers can offload a Nayef Aguerd or Maxwel Cornet soon then it would give them a fantastic chance.

Especially as Petrovic could remain in London and knows he would be the guaranteed number one.

After being crowned 2024/25 Bundesliga champions, Bayern Munich are looking to add another trophy to their collection at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States.

The German giants begin their campaign on June 15, facing New Zealand club Auckland City at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati (kick-off: 18:00 CET). 

Bayern are overwhelming favorites heading into this first-round match. While Auckland City are the most successful team in Oceania, having won 11 of the last 13 OFC Champions League titles, the gulf in quality is undeniable.

The New Zealanders are an amateur club, with players receiving only a modest weekly allowance of around $90 for basic expenses.

With that in mind, the excitement within the Auckland City squad is understandable as they prepare for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

“It's probably our dream group,” said Auckland City striker Angus Kilkolly in an interview with AFP, referring to their group-stage opponents Bayern Munich, Benfica, and Boca Juniors.

“To experience playing against those teams is a dream for us. To be on the same pitch is a little bit crazy.”

Heading into the tournament, Bayern have been boosted by the return of Dayot Upamecano and Jamal Musiala to training after long-term injuries. Both players are expected to be gradually eased back into competitive action during the Club World Cup.

The Bavarians have also strengthened their squad with two early summer signings: Jonathan Tah from Bayer Leverkusen and Tom Bischof from Hoffenheim. Both newcomers are eligible and included in Bayern's Club World Cup squad.

FC Bayern Munich: Neuer – Laimer, Tah, Stanisic, Guerreiro – Pavlovic, Kimmich – Olise, Müller, Gnabry – Kane.

Auckland City: Tracey – Legos, Mitchell, Boxal, Lobo – Garriga, Ilic, Yoo – Manickum, Bevan, Zeb.

Real Madrid have always been driven by star players - can Alonso break the cycle by imposing a tactical ideology to take the club into a new era? 

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Florentino Perez can already see a new place in history. The Real Madrid president has naturally watched all the archive footage of predecessor Santiago Bernabeu winning the first European Cup, in 1956, and now wants to emulate him by winning the first Club World Cup. Perez has been making grand proclamations about it fitting Madrid's grandeur, as they prepare for the United States.

In order to do that, however, he also had to face up to the present and the future. He realised Madrid had to change, and not just as regards the identity of the manager. So did the very football identity of the team.

Perez has long been adamant Carlo Ancelotti's successor had to be Xabi Alonso, mostly on the guidance of his more sophisticated football hierarchy, such as chief scout Juni Calafat. Perez then became even more adamant that Alonso had to take over before the Club World Cup. If Ancelotti had run his course, Madrid had to ensure they were up and running for this unique moment in history. Alonso was willing to accept, on one condition: Madrid had to secure certain signings this summer.

They haven't all arrived yet, which adds to the challenge of only having three training sessions with his full squad before the Club World Cup starts.

Through all that, the competition has been given one of its more compelling storylines.

That is whether Alonso can impose a modern tactical ideology on a club that has traditionally been resistant to such thinking. Madrid have been the anti-Barcelona in that sense. They have never been a manager club, let alone an ideology club. As one rival chief executive said, “you almost get the sense they'd rather not have a coach”. Stars have always driven everything at Madrid, and Ancelotti's facilitation of them was the main reason that he became the longest serving coach, after Bernabeu's own appointment, Miguel Munoz.

It is perhaps instructive that Munoz, who himself lasted 14 years and won two European Cups, was also one of the club's great players. He actually scored Madrid's first ever goal in the European Cup, in 1955, and was duly a part of those first champions.

Zinedine Zidane was another along those lines. Despite winning three Champions Leagues as a manager, he was often dismissed as a “clap your hands coach”. In other words, that he just enabled inherent talent. Toni Kroos and Luka Modric were the ones who imposed an ideology. It is at least striking that their partnership totally coincided with Madrid's modern Champions League era, although it was started with Alonso himself in the Kroos role for 2014.

The 43-year-old, then, is not only a rare ideology manager that Madrid have appointed. He's a rare ideology manager with the playing stature to back it up.

That is both what is needed at this club to transform their football approach, and what this club has always needed to succeed.

The 2024-25 season seemed to show that even Ancelotti's classic approach was less effective, especially now that individualism is not quite the distinctive advantage it used to be.

A certain freedom is returning to a less dogmatic game. Alonso himself typifies a new trend of applying Pep Guardiola principles but with greater pragmatism and adaptability.

He now has to adapt a system for Madrid's current stars, but at the point when it looks like a certain egotism has returned to the dressing room and the squad is ill-fitting. The most obvious problem is that the two best attackers, Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappe, are also at their best in the same left-forward position.

Alonso's plan isn't so much to bypass that problem. Training and analysis session so far indicate that the Basque wants to play a 4-4-2 that can shift into a 3-4-1-2.

Mbappe and Vinicius are intended to be the two. That is why Rodrygo is going to be available for transfer, since there will no longer be a place for such a wide player. Alonso intends for the width to be provided by the full-backs, which is where the signing of Trent Alexander-Arnold makes even more sense.

If that potentially leaves the two at the back overly exposed, the idea would then be for the central midfielder to drop in. That is in turn why Madrid have been so frustrated at Arsenal advancing on Martin Zubimendi.

It's all the worse that he's considered the future of the Spanish national team. Madrid are likely to have to work elsewhere.

While all of this at least starts to make sense on paper, there is obviously so much more to Alonso's approach than the arrangement of players. What makes that work are the rhythms, the interchanges and the understanding, that take time to instil.

Ismael Garcia Gomez is a Spanish coach currently serving as Galatasaray's assistant manager, and respected as one of the brightest analysts. He believes it would have been difficult for Madrid to find someone better, especially as regards what they're doing.

“I expect more tactical discipline and much more control of games,” he says. “The challenge is of course not only to win, but to impose a style that Madrid have never historically had. It's more like Antonio Conte, or Barcelona, or Manchester City. Alonso will want a style that everyone knows, to say ‘this is Real Madrid'.”

The great question now is how quickly he can impose this, and to what extent we'll actually see it at the Club World Cup.

Might the education process necessary - especially at a club that hasn't had this - even inhibit the chances of fulfilling Perez's ambition?

That's the risk the president has taken, which is going to now require even more composure from Alonso.

This is a unique moment in time. The manager has to illustrate he can have a unique effect.

With only one year to go until the FIFA World Cup in 2026, and the Gold Cup starting this weekend, the United States men's national team is set to enter another tournament following a loss by four goals. It didn't end well in the Copa America last year, where they crashed out in the group stage. A year later, despite new head coach Mauricio Pochettino leading the squad, not much has changed with the World Cup looming.

Pochettino was without members of his top squad due to Christian Pulisic missing this camp for rest, Tyler Adams picking up a foot injury, FIFA Club World Cup commitments, and other various injuries, but even with some top talent available, the USMNT have struggled against Concacaf opposition after losing to Panama and Canada during the Concacaf Nations League.

The good vibes of switching to the accomplished Argentine manager have faded, and they've been replaced by former national team players criticizing current ones and general worry about whether this team can even perform in a World Cup on home soil. The cup in 2026 will be a celebration of soccer, and the USMNT may have qualified for the World Cup as hosts, but depending on how their draw shakes out, it could be a struggle to get out of the group. There's a very real situation where a team like Italy can end up as a pot-four team, potentially giving the USMNT a tougher draw than expected as a host nation. On the other side, 32 of the 48 teams make it out of the group, so not making it out with an easy format would be an absolute disaster.

Here's what to know about the current situation

In 10 matches in charge of the USMNT, Pochettino has won five matches and lost five, with the team scoring 15 goals and conceding 14. His last four matches have been especially disappointing, seeing the USMNT lose four while conceding nine goals and only scoring three. In Gregg Berhalter's entire tenure with the USMNT, they only lost 17 total matches, with him managing 74. To Pochettino's credit, the USMNT have played tough matches, losing to two teams in the top 30 of the FIFA men's national team rankings in Turkiye and Switzerland, but just playing tough sides for the sake of it will only go so far without showing improvement while doing it.

Expectations for these matches weren't high with a largely inexperienced side coming into camp under Pochettino, but the lack of effort on Switzerland's goals in the first half was glaring. Pochettino took the blame for his team's failures, but the Argentine can't go out and make a tackle or hold on when making a save to avoid a follow-up chance from hitting the back of the net. Those failures are firmly on the USMNT players, and they're things that can't be happening with the World Cup looming.

The first team regulars will return and have a chance to right the ship, but with only four international breaks remaining after the Gold Cup wraps, time is dwindling before Pochettino will need to name his final squad. Problems such as the starting striker and goalkeeper will also remain when figuring out that squad. Even if the USMNT are able to succeed at the Gold Cup, that won't answer every question after seeing how these players have performed against top opposition. The ceiling for this team could be repeating the 2022 World Cup, where they made it out of the group stage before losing to the Netherlands in the round of 16.

World Cup organizers, like host city executive/CEO of Philadelphia Soccer 2026, Meg Kane, doesn't believe that the USMNT's performance will dim the shine of the competition coming to the United States, but fans will want to root for the USMNT as long as they can and may need to temper expectations.

"I don't think that the current state of the U.S. men's national team takes away from the excitement or enthusiasm about this. I think the fact is that the World Cup is about national pride and the love of soccer, and whether you have an amazing team, whether you have a team that is maybe struggling a little bit," Kane said. "The fact is that when the World Cup starts, every fan is in it with their team, ride or die, and I think that Americans will be the way with the U.S. men's national team just like they are with the women's national team."

Kane is right, but there's a big difference between the men's and women's teams. The USWNT are one of the best teams in the world and have World Cup and Olympic titles to show for it, while the USMNT are trying to do their best to hang with the best teams in the world. It will take longer than a year to improve core issues like youth development in the country, but not enough has changed since 2022 to make it seem like this team has a chance of advancing past the round of 16.

Getting a very favorable path could see the USMNT squeak into the last eight, but nothing has shown that they're even a top 30 team in the world during recent years, and there is no reason to believe they are ready to get out of their group. Time is winding down to change that, and friendlies facing South Korea and Japan in September will give the USMNT time for a statement victory with their top squad, but if the issues from the summer persist, expectations will continue to drop and rightfully so.

The 2009 Wimbledon championships marked Andy Roddick's third appearance in the final at the All England Club. 

Roddick had reached the final stage at Wimbledon twice before, in 2004 and 2005, when both times he met Roger Federer. 

In each of those matches, the American had only managed to take one set in total from the Swiss legend, who won the tournament five times in a row from 2003 to 2007.

The former world number one's last chance at holding the trophy aloft on Centre Court was in 2009, where, despite having been a point away from a two-set lead, Roddick ultimately lost to Federer once again. 

It was a crushing defeat for the former US Open champion, who managed to find the words to sum up his feelings on court after the match. 

Conducting his runner-up interview, former British tennis player Sue Barker said to Roddick: “After a match like that, I just think this sport is so cruel.”

Roddick responded: “No, I'm one of the lucky ones who gets cheered for, so thank you for that [acknowledges crowd].

“I just want to say congratulations to Roger, he's a true champion and he deserves everything he gets, so well done Roger.”

Barker said: “Well, you threw everything at him. 

Roddick replied: “Well, I tried, sorry Pete [Sampras], I tried to hold him off.

“It was an honour playing in front of great champions like Pete, Manolo [Santana], Rod [Laver] and Bjorn [Borg] there.

“I still hope that my name will be up there with theirs as a winner of this tournament. I'll be back,” promised Roddick. 

After three trips to the final in six years, Roddick never made it past the fourth round at Wimbledon after 2009. 

The following year, he made it to round four at the event, but lost to Lu Yen-hsun over five sets.

In 2011, after two straight-set victories in his opening round matches, Roddick lost to Feliciano Lopez in the third round. 

Roddick's last Wimbledon campaign came in 2012, where he once again lost in the third round, bowing out to David Ferrer in four sets. 

He retired after the US Open that year, announcing he would call it a day on his career on August 30th, the day he turned 30.

After taking home her first French Open title in dramatic fashion, tennis superstar Coco Gauff peeled back the curtain on the reality of her Grand Slam victory.

In a video posted via TikTok on Monday, June 9, Gauff, 21, spoke over a backdrop of her hoisting the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen trophy after defeating Aryna Sabalenka in the women's final on Saturday, June 7.

“This is the trophy that you guys see, the one that we take pictures with, do press with and all that,” Gauff explained. “Actually, we don't get to take this home. This stays with the tournament.”

Gauff then pulled out the actual trophy she received, which is a much smaller replica of the one she was presented with inside Court Philippe-Chatrier.



To compare, Gauff held the mini trophy over her head and laughed. “It's really small,” she said. 

Gauff even placed the trophy next to a glass bottle of Perrier for a size comparison, with the bottle eclipsing more than half of the trophy's height.

“It's the memories that matter the most,” Gauff said of the surprisingly small piece of hardware. “It is very pretty and it is a miniature version of the real trophy. So, this is the one I get to take home.”

fun fact! #rolandgarros

Many tennis fans in the comments were shocked to learn that the French Open champion doesn't actually receive the trophy seen on TV. 

“Wow, the real trophy is massive compared to the one you get to take home!” one wrote “But hey, memories last forever!”

Another commented, “Something I don't think many of us knew outside the world of professional tennis. 😳 In any case, as long as your name is spelled correctly engraved in The Hall of Champions and that check clears. 😏”

Gauff's French Open victory was not without controversy, as Sabalenka, 27, drew the ire of many critics for saying it was “the worst final I have ever played” and partially crediting Gauff's win to some luck. 

“She was hitting the ball from the frame, somehow magically the ball lands in the court,” Sabalenka told reporters after Gauff's 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 triumph. “It felt like a joke, honestly, like somebody from above was there laughing, like, ‘Let's see if you can handle this.' … I think she won the match not because she played incredible, just because I made all of those mistakes.”

Gauff responded to Sabalenka's comments after the match, saying, “I don't agree with that.”

“The way Aryna was playing the last few weeks, she was the favorite to win,” Gauff added. “So I think she was the best person that I could have played in the final. Her being No. 1 in the world was the best person to play, so I think I got the hardest matchup just if you go off stats alone.”

Sabalenka attempted to clarify her comments the next day, congratulating Gauff on social media. 

“Yesterday was a tough one,” Sabalenka shared via her Instagram Story. “Coco handled the conditions much better than I did and fully deserved the win. She was the better player yesterday, and I want to give her the credit she earned.”

Daniil Medvedev faced a double test on Thursday at the Libema Open, playing his first grass-court match of the season and facing the unorthodox game of Adrian Mannarino. The top seed in 's-Hertogenbosch came through the challenging opener with a 7-6(6), 6-4 victory, fuelled by a strong finish in the first-set tie-break, in which he saved two set points at 4/6.

The matchup was the pair's fourth at this event — the most frequent matchup in tournament history — and the ninth in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series; they are now level at 2-2 in 's-Hertogenbosch, with Medvedev leading 5-4 overall. Five of their nine meetings have come on grass, including a five-set win for Mannarino at Wimbledon in 2018.



In a physical, scrappy match, Medvedev did not face a break point after dropping serve in the opening game. He converted two of his nine break chances, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

"He plays perfect on grass, he plays low, so you cannot really — at least me with my shots‚ I cannot really hit through the ball," the No. 11 in the PIF ATP Rankings said of Mannarino. "I actually make it the same for him, and that's why we both kind of can't hit winners from each other's shots, and so we just play this cat-and-mouse game, which is tough physically for both of us."

Through to his 82nd tour-level quarter-final and his 12th on grass, Medvedev will next meet Reilly Opelka. In a match between two of the biggest servers on Tour, the American lucky loser fired 12 aces in a 7-6(5), 6-3 win against Nicolas Jarry.

In other action, Zizou Bergs rallied from a set down to claw past fourth seed Alexei Popyrin 6-7(3), 6-2, 7-6(3). Bergs struck 31 winners and is the first Belgian quarter-finalist at the grass-court event since David Goffin in 2025.

Into his seventh tour-level quarter-final and fourth of the season, Bergs will next meet Estonian qualifier Mark Lajal, who advanced after Hubert Hurkacz was forced to withdraw due to a lower back injury.

Second seed Ugo Humbert retired in the second round at Roland Garros last month but showed little sign of discomfort in his first match since, beating Daniel Evans 7-5, 6-3. The Frenchman converted all three break points he conjured, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to a one-hour, 41-minute win.

Seeking his second title of the season, the Marseille champion will play Nuno Borges in the quarter-finals.

...

No wonder Emma Raducanu started off her second-round contest at Queen's in a blaze of glory. Like a firecracker, ready to ignite, eager to land in Friday's quarter-finals.

A few hours earlier, the 22-year-old learned that, when the new WTA rankings are released on Monday, she will be back as British No 1. Raducanu will replace Katie Boulter, her “BoulterCanu” doubles partner this week, at the top of British women's tennis. A blessing or a curse? Either way, it's all just in time for all the hoopla and hype of Wimbledon in a few weeks.

Yet to Thursday and west London, where she still had matters to attend to on-court in the form of Slovak world No 41 Rebecca Sramkova, who is four places below her in the current world rankings. And, in essence, what the near sellout crowd were greeted to was a 76-minute sampler of what makes Raducanu such a thrilling prospect on the grass. Thrilling, and baffling, in somewhat equal measure.

The good? A scintillating opening 20 minutes, steamrolling to a 5-0 lead, middling every shot and taking authoritative control of every rally. There was, undoubtedly, oomph in her movement and persona. But, the bad? In an instant, she lost her mojo, was broken twice, and ultimately only squeezed to the first-set finish line. It was the sort of 15-minute blip she can ill-afford if she wants to make progress deep in tournaments this summer. Fortunately, the second set was more routine as Sramkova lost her way, and a 6-4 6-1 victory in the end was just reward for a lightning quick start.

“Long live BoulterCanu,” she wrote on the courtside camera, a nod to her doubles partnership this week and a close-knit group of British women at the top of the game currently.

“It's nice, but it's not the most important thing for me,” she said afterwards, questioned about the No 1 spot. “Having Katie in front, it was nice having something to chase. She now has that. We have a healthy competition between us, but we want to see each other do well.”

Up until that point, it had been a tough day for the Brits on day four. Boulter, who has held the British No 1 tag for exactly two years, started strongly against world No 10 Diana Shnaider by taking the opening set, describing it later as her “best tennis of the week”.

But the match quickly turned in the Russian's favour, particularly after a brief rain break halfway through the second set. In the end, Shnaider romped home to a 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory to set up a clash with Australian Open champion Madison Keys in the last eight. Boulter, understandably for a match which seemed well within her grasp, was exasperated by the end.

Heather Watson soon followed, with the 33-year-old (now ranked 134 in the world) having come through qualifying to reach the main draw. The Guernsey local impressed in a straight-sets win over Yulia Putintseva on Tuesday but, with 123 places between them, 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina was too strong in round two, progressing with a relatively routine 6-4, 6-2 win.

Still, Watson can be proud of her efforts, as she keeps her fingers crossed for a Wimbledon wild card when they are announced by the AELTC next week. “I'm praying over here,” she admitted afterwards. “It would be a gift.”

It was therefore up to Raducanu, the last Brit standing, to keep home hopes alive. Swinging from the hip like someone who had a looming dinner reservation in Kensington tonight, she grabbed the initiative impressively, against a player in Sramkova who beat defending Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova in the first round.

Three breaks in a row were accompanied by regular “Come on!” screams towards her box, with Mark Petchey and Nick Cavaday her dual coaches in her corner. Annabel Croft, on commentary for the BBC, described her start as “breathtaking”.

Yet a stunning opening 20 minutes was followed by a curiously inconsistent 15 minutes, in which she let two breaks of serve slip and errors entered her realm. Mercifully, she held at 5-4 to claim the opener.

The second set was more a case of remaining solid while Sramkova crumbled; the Slovak regularly gesticulating towards her corner and, by the end, her head was literally in her hands after a routine miss. Two powerful backhand returns sealed the deal for Raducanu, to the delight of the home crowd on the Andy Murray Arena.

It means Raducanu will be back on Friday, likely to take on first seed Qinwen Zheng in the quarter-finals. Now that, an Olympic champion and world No 5, will be a serious – and perfect – test of her grass court credentials, just two weeks out from Wimbledon.

Emma Raducanu to return to British No 1 on Monday after racing into the quarter-finals at Queen's Club; Follow scores and reports from Queen's Club and you can watch all the action from the ATP and WTA on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Thursday 12 June 2025 18:14, UK

Emma Raducanu celebrated returning to British No 1 on Monday by racing into the quarter-finals at Queen's Club with a 6-4 6-1 win against Rebecca Sramkova.

Raducanu, who will take over top spot after Katie Boulter bowed out of the tournament earlier on Thursday, secured her 11th WTA Tour quarter-final after she defeated world No 41 Sramkova in one hour and 17 minutes and could face top seed Qinwen Zheng next.

The 22-year-old is also closing in on a Wimbledon seeding [live ranking 36]. A couple more wins this week or in Berlin next week would assure her of of top 32 spot ahead of her home Grand Slam.

Boulter suffered a 2-6 6-3 6-2 second-round defeat to Russian fifth-seed Diana Shnaider.

Boulter, who replaced 2021 US Open winner Raducanu in the top spot exactly two years ago, looked sharp in her first set, saving two break points, breaking the Russian's serve twice, and hitting 10 winners.

"I absolutely loved my time here,' Boulter said after the match. "Obviously, as a British player, I always take these losses a lot harder than most of the other ones. I want to do well here. I wish I could have been here longer. But at the same time, I am very well aware that a lot of tournaments are based on draws and matchups and who you play and who you don't.

"Tennis is a funny one,' Boulter added. "Some people lose 250 points one week, some people lose zero, some people lose 100. It's something that happens every single week.

"I'm very well aware that I lost 250 this week, because Nottingham is next week and the scheduling's been different. Of course I personally want to be getting my ranking moving in the right direction.

"I'm very happy for her to be British No 1. But at the same time, it's going to be fun for me to chase her now, and I think she's been doing that for a while. Now it's kind of my turn."

The first-serve issues that had plagued Boulter in her gritty victory over Australian qualifier Ajla Tomljanovic on Monday also looked to have largely been resolved after she landed close to 75 per cent in the opening set.

They returned at the start of Boulter's first service game in the second, when she twice double-faulted to allow Shnaider to find her way back from 40-0 down and break the Briton's serve, and did so again after a 15-minute rain delay in the sixth game to take a 5-1 advantage.

Boulter broke straight back and saved a set point to hold the next game, but could not claw her way to a comeback as Shnaider forced the deciding set.

It began with another Boulter double-fault, but the Briton was able to claw her way back from 40-0 down to hold.

Two more double-faults in the third game - Boulter ultimately tallied a total of nine in the match - opened the door for Shnaider to break Boulter's serve, doing so again in the seventh to set herself up to serve for the set and seal her place in the quarter-finals.

Shnaider begged the British crowd for forgiveness after knocking out the home favourite at the Andy Murray Arena.

"I definitely want to first apologise to the crowd," the 21-year-old said on court. "I mean, Katie is such a lovely person, I love her with all my heart, so to play her and beat her in front of a home crowd I feel so sorry, but I hope you're not going to hate me too much and come support me tomorrow."

Compatriot Heather Watson also bowed out in the last-16 after she was beaten 6-4 6-2 by former Wimbledon champion and fourth seed Elena Rybakina.

Wimbledon will step up security this summer after Raducanu's stalking ordeal in Dubai where she received unwanted attention from a "fixated" man both before and during a match against Karolina Muchova.

The Briton admitted this week that she is still "wary" when she goes out with the All-England Club stating that the safety of players is "our absolute priority" and will put in place "measures that are reflective of the threat".

Speaking at today's spring conference, All-England Club chief executive Sally Bolton said: "The safety and wellbeing of all of the players is our absolute top priority. I think the recent incidents coming to light certainly recognise the concern generated by that. But we have in place - and have had for many years - processes for ensuring the safety of our players.

"And that is in liaison with law enforcement agencies, specialist security teams and we liaise with both tours. And that is year round not just in preparation for The Championships. And it is a bit like the broader security for the grounds.

"We are putting in place measures that are reflective of the threat and risk profile at the time. It is absolutely a top priority for us.

"We probably wouldn't at this point comment on any details in respect of any individual athlete but that intelligence is being gathered working with those other parties throughout the year to make sure we have got the right measures in place come The Championships."

Boulter said: "I think that's a really good thing. I think they've obviously noticed there has been a few issues with it and they are reacting to it, which is really good to see.

"It's really good to see them putting emphasis on it and making the players seem very comfortable, and I think that's so important."

Reflecting on what she went through in Dubai, Raducanu told the BBC: "I've definitely noticed a difference in how people are watching my back when I'm on the site.

"I'm obviously wary when I go out. I try not to be careless about it because you only realise how much of a problem it is when you're in that situation and I don't necessarily want to be in that situation again.

"But off the court right now, I feel good. I feel pretty settled. I feel like I have good people around me and anything that was kind of negative I'm just like trying to brush it off as much as I can."

The grass court season is well underway as the stars of the ATP Tour begin their preparations for Wimbledon.

Two ATP 250 tournaments in Stuttgart and the Netherlands have kicked off the grass-court season.

While top ten stars Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz compete in Stuttgart, several big names took the trip to the Netherlands for the Libema Open.

Former world number one Daniil Medvedev is the top seed, joined by the likes of Ugo Humbert, Karen Khachanov, and Alexei Popyrin.

The top four seeds were likely looking over their shoulders at the Libema Open's number five seed, who has some serious grass-court pedigree.

However, just hours before his second-round match, the 2021 Wimbledon semi-finalist was forced to withdraw from the event with an injury to his lower back.

During the latter stages of his first-round win against Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut, Hubert Hurkacz was seen struggling with an injury to his lower back.

He had hoped to recover in time for his second-round clash with Estonian qualifier Mark Lajal, updating fans on his fitness during his post-match interview on Wednesday.

“Obviously, toward the end, I had to fight through it; it wasn't easy, but I hope I'll feel better tomorrow,”  said Hurkacz.

“My back is still a bit sore, but I'll work with the physio in the coming hours and do everything to improve my condition.”

Unable to recover in time, Hurkacz withdrew just hours before his second-round match, as Lajal advanced to the quarterfinals, where he will take on either Popyrin or Zizou Bergs.

The Pole could have done without another setback, having already endured a tricky start to his 2025 campaign.

Struggling for form during the early months of the season, Hurkacz suffered an injury after Indian Wells, which saw him miss two Masters 1000 events (the Miami Open and Monte-Carlo Masters).

Bouncing back on clay, Hurkacz reached the quarterfinals in Rome before qualifying for his first final of the year in Geneva.

Pushing the 24-time Major champion all the way, Hurkacz narrowly came up short against Novak Djokovic in the Geneva Open final, 7-5, 6-7, 6-7.

During the trophy presentations, Djokovic shared some kind words with Hurkacz, praising him for ‘cutting his comeback' from injury short.

“Congrats to your team as well. I know how it feels to be injured with the knee, it's a big challenge to come back, you've managed to cut your comeback short, and reach already a very high level,” he said.

Now dealing with a fresh injury, it remains to be seen whether or not Hurkacz will withdraw from next week's ATP 500 event in Halle.

Hurkacz reached the final in Halle 12 months ago, and risks falling out of the world's top 40 if he is unable to compete.

Fans of the 28-year-old will certainly hope to see him back in action before too long, on a surface where he enjoyed one of the best results of his career.

Hurkacz enjoyed his best-ever Grand Slam performance at Wimbledon four years ago, when he embarked on a sensational run to the semi-finals.

The big-serving Pole barely broke a sweat in his opening three matches, setting up an intriguing fourth-round clash with Medvedev.

There, Hurkacz battled through in five tight sets, to beat the Russian 2-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.

Up next was a Centre Court clash with one of the greatest players in tennis history, Roger Federer.

Stunning the 20-time Major champion in straight sets, Hurkacz defeated Federer, 6-3, 7-6, 6-0, in the Swiss star's final professional match.

The win saw Hurkacz advance to his first Major semi-final, where he took on Italy's Matteo Berrettini.

Both players were searching for a place in their first Grand Slam final, but it was Berrettini who prevailed, winning in four sets.

Hurkacz hasn't quite been able to rediscover that form since, losing before the quarterfinal stage in his three previous visits to the All England Club.

Should he be fit to compete in 2025, Hurkacz will certainly be hoping for a better showing this time around.

The 2025 Wimbledon tournament is scheduled to begin on Monday, June 30.

Katie Boulter suffered a disappointing second-round defeat at the Queen's Club on Thursday and, to add insult to injury, will lose her British No. 1 ranking to Emma Raducanu. The 28-year-old enjoyed a two-year reign as the top British woman but it will finally come to an end when the standings update on Monday.

Boulter and Raducanu joined forces in the doubles at Queen's this week, so there are no hard feelings. And the current world No. 34 has already poured cold water on fans' hopes that they could team up again at Wimbledon later this month.

In the first edition of the new WTA 500 event at Queen's, Boulter won one singles match before bowing out to No. 5 seed Diana Shnaider 2-6 6-3 6-2 on Thursday.

It was a disappointing defeat for the 28-year-old, who felt she had chances to win the match, and it means Raducanu will officially become the British No. 1 next week, for the first time since she shut down her 2023 season to have three surgeries.

Boulter's ranking suffered a blow this week because the 250 points she received for winning Nottingham last year were removed this week after the grass season schedule changed.

After falling behind Raducanu, she said: “Tennis is a funny one. You know, some people lose 250 points one week, some people lose zero, some people lose 100. It's something that happens every single week.

“I'm very well aware that I lost 250 this week, because Nottingham was next week and the scheduling's been different. Of course I personally want to be getting my ranking moving in the right direction. I'm very happy for her to be British No. 1.

“But at the same time, it's going to be fun for me to chase her now, and I think she's been doing that for a while. Now it's kind of my turn.”

Boulter also suffered defeat in doubles on Wednesday alongside Raducanu, going out to No. 1 seeds Erin Routliffe and Lyudmyla Kichenok. While they enjoyed the experience, they have no plans to revive their partnership at the All England Club.

The three-time title winner added: “I had a great time playing with Emma this week. I'm sure we will do it at some point. I'm not sure when, but at some point I'm sure we will.

“I don't know about that one. Maybe we'll find out a little later if we do that or not. It's not in the plans at the moment.”

Boulter will return to Nottingham next week, where she lifted the trophy in 2023 and 2024. With her ranking points already coming off, she feels she can swing freely again despite being the reigning champion there.

“Sitting here right now, I personally don't feel any pressure. I'm actually quite excited to go out and swing free now my points are off this week, so I've got nothing to lose from now,” she explained.

“It's not like I had a massive run in Wimbledon or in Eastbourne last year, so yeah, I can take a breath. I can enjoy it. I can enjoy playing now. And, you know, I'm on my favourite surface, I've got a great chance, I'm at my home tournament. I can swing free and, yeah, hopefully make a few more points.

“But honestly, like, I find that's not necessarily my focus. It really isn't. My focus is to keep improving my game, and to play matches like this today and start showing that I can beat people around that ranking, as well.”

The Delray Tennis Center, which opened in 1974, has been a hub for women's tennis. It hosted the former Virginia Slims Tournament and the Billie Jean King Fed and Davis cups.

Titles earned by the top tennis athletes who have lived in this county reach back into the 1970s and continue through present times.

Delray Beach's own tennis star Coco Gauff scored a hard-fought victory over Aryna Sabalenka on June 7 to bring home the French Open title.

It isn't the first time the trophy has arrived in Palm Beach County.

Gauff joins at least six other women's champions who have lived or stayed in a county where tennis thrives, drawing several elite professional players.

Evert Tennis Academy Boca Raton has trained many college and elite professionals. It is operated and owned by Chris Evert and her brother John.

Chris Evert, 70, one of the greatest female tennis players of all time, is the queen of French Open women's championships and has spent most of her life in Boca Raton.

She won the French in 1974-75, 1979-80, 1983 and 1985-86 — the highest number of victories for a female at Roland Garros in the open era. Now she covers the tournament each year as a color commmentator. She called the Gauff-Sabalenka final.

Though she was born in Fort Lauderdale, she moved to Boca at age 16 and raised her three sons born during her second marriage to Olympic skier Andy Mill here. She bought her house on 5 acres in 2003 and sold it in 2018. She still owns the tennis academy with her brother and helps coach the tennis team at Saint Andrews School, where she also coached her three sons.

She was briefly married to professional golfer Greg Norman, who lives in Palm Beach Gardens, in 2008. The marriage lasted about a year.

Two-time French Open champion Martina Navratilova, 68, doesn't live in Palm Beach County, but her wedding reception was held in Palm Beach a few months after she got married and she has often visited her good friend, Evert.

Navratilova, yet another women's tennis great, won the French Open in 1982 and 1984.

Evert attended the reception for Navratilova and Julie Lemigova on Feb. 14, 2015. The couple tied the knot at the Peninsula Hotel in New York City the previous December. It's not clear where the reception occurred on the island.

Navratilova and Lemigova got engaged in September 2014 during a U.S. Open Tennis Channel interview when Navratilova turned to Lemigova, got down on one knee and produced a diamond ring.

They live in Miami Beach and own a farm in Broward County. Lemigova is a cast member of "The Real Housewives of Miami."

Steffi Graf, 55, bought a second home at the height of her game in 1989 at the Polo Club of Boca Raton. She owned it through a stalking episode, dating and marrying fellow tennis great Andre Agassi and having their two babies.

It was sold in 2003 when the family moved to Las Vegas, where Agassi grew up.

Graf's first Grand Slam title was at the French in 1987 and her last before she retired in 1999. In between, she added four more — in 1988, 1993 and 1995-96.

She and Agassi first started seeing each other after the French Open in 1999 when she was 30.

A man was charged with trespassing in 1992 at Polo Club after trying a number of times to contact Graf. He said he was a terrorist and wanted to harm the West German native.

Monica Seles, 51, was the youngest ever French champion in 1990 at age 16. She dominated at Roland Garros in the early 1990s, winning three in a row from 1990 to 1992.

In 1991, she couldn't manage to evade the press after she'd won the Australian and French but had to withdraw from Wimbledon days before it began. She was besieged at her Sarasota home.

Soon after she and her family were spotted on the grounds of Mar-a-Lago. News reports at the time said they stayed there about six weeks before Seles re-emerged at the U.S. Open where she took the title.

It's not known how she knew now-President Donald Trump, who had bought the historic property a year earlier.

Some felt her career was cut tragically short when a fan of Graf got on the court in Hamburg, Germany and stabbed Seles in the shoulder. Seles was out of action for two years, suffering from depression and an eating disorder.

Jennifer Capriati, 49, made her professional debut in 1990 at the age of 13 years, 11 months, reaching the finals at the Boca Raton Tournament. She made it to the semifinals of the French the same year.

Her personal struggles began to show with arrests for shoplifting jewelry at a Tampa mall in 1993 and possession of marijuana the next year. Capriati wasn't convicted of either charge.

Her single French Open title came in 2001 after winning only one match between 1994 and 1998. Then she staged a comeback with a vengeance, sending her into the Top 10.

Capriati had to stop competing in 2004 because of injuries. Years late, she faced criminal charges and was saved from a drug overdose, both in or near her 2,800-square-foot condo on Singer Island, which she bought in 2007.

In June 2010, Capriati was rushed to St. Mary's Medical Center for an accidental overdose of prescription medication.

In 2013, she was arrested on charges of stalking and battery against her ex-boyfriend, Ivan Brannan Jr., who also owned a condo on Singer Island.

In a Valentine's Day incident, Capriati punched her boyfriend in the chest at a North Palm Beach gym. On Feb. 18, a co-worker of Brannan's told North Palm Beach police that Capriati tried to get into a locked door at their office. She was pacing, yelling and pounding on a window. The co-worker also told police that Capriati had called the business up to 50 times a day. That was the ninth incident involving Capriati and Brannan in which police were called to investigate.

Charges against Capriati were dropped after she completed anger management classes and community service.

Serena Williams, 43, considered the greatest women's tennis player of all time, moved to Palm Beach County with her tennis star sister Venus when she was 9 in order to be coached by Rick Macci in Boca Raton.

Williams owns 23 Grand Slams titles, three from the French in 2002, 2013 and 2015. Venus, no slouch herself with seven Grand Slam titles, never took a French Open.

Together they bought a property with an 8,500-square-foot home featuring two master suites in Ballenisles in 2000, according to Palm Beach County official records. Serena in 2001 bought a property with her mother in Jupiter's Abacoa. She has owned a number of north county properties along with her husband, Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian.

Coco Gauff's family moved to Delray Beach when she was 7, but The Palm Beach Post learned recently that Gauff was actually born at West Boca Medical Center. She came early, during her mother's baby shower, so despite her parents living in Atlanta at the time, she's a true Palm Beach County native.

The shower, which carried on without Candi, Coco's mother, was hosted at the home of Coco's grandmother, Yvonne Lee Odom, who in 1961 was the first Black student to attend Delray Beach's all-white Seacrest High School.

Yvonne Odom and her husband, Eddie Odom Jr., founded the Delray Beach American Little League to extend the sport to kids in mostly Black neighborhoods not covered by the other league.

Gauff grew up in Delray Beach, training at Pompey Park.

Gauff credits her neighbors to the north in Palm Beach County as her inspiration.

"Serena Williams has always been my idol...and Venus," she has said. "They are the reason why I wanted to pick up a tennis racquet."

Novak Djokovic is often considered the greatest tennis player of all time, but not by world number 26 Stefanos Tsitsipas. 

Djokovic is a record 24-time Grand Slam champion, winning nine of those major titles with Goran Ivanisevic as his coach.

The Serbian parted ways with the former Wimbledon champion last year, with Ivanisevic now coaching Tsitsipas.

While Djokovic and Tsitsipas now have that in common, the Greek has picked another player as his greatest player of all time.

As a result of winning more major titles than anyone else, Djokovic is often seen as the greatest player in history.

However, when speaking in a video at the Patrick Mouratoglou Tennis Academy, Tsitsipas revealed that he thinks that his greatest men's player of all time is Roger Federer.

Federer previously made a big claim about Tsitsipas, and now the two-time Grand Slam finalist has returned the favour claiming that not having the most major titles does not matter to him.

“My GOAT would be Roger Federer,” said Tsitsipas. “Obviously he doesn't have the most Grand Slam titles but – to me – it doesn't matter. To me, what matters is the effect that he has had on the world of tennis, not just on the world of tennis, but in global sports. 

“I would compare it to the effect of Michael Jordan and I feel lucky that I have had the opportunity to share the tennis court with him. 

“It was probably one of the most majestic experiences of my life, getting to step out on the court and play against him. I suddenly felt alive, even though he kicked my a** a few times.”

Djokovic has won more Grand Slam titles than both his former rivals, but it is Federer who has won the most ATP titles overall.

Tsitsipas played Federer four times before he retired in 2022, with their head-to-head level at two wins apiece.

However, the former world number three has a losing record against both Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.

Tsitsipas, whose girlfriend is Paula Badosa, followed up on his comments about Federer by naming his greatest women's player of all time.

The 26-year-old went on to name Serena Williams, who Tsitsipas has previously trained with.

“On the woman's side, I would say Serena Williams, what she has done is superb,” said Tsitsipas. 

“Her story is unique and I really look up to her and she has big charisma and also presence because I've spoken to her a few times and I've obviously practised with her, I feel like she really deserves that title.”

Tsitsipas is not the only person who has recently made this claim, with Chris Evert also calling Williams the greatest after ranking her top five.

Former British tennis star and current pundit Andrew Castle doesn't believe Andy Murray would've been coaching Novak Djokovic in the literal sense of the word. The tennis world was left gobsmacked when it was revealed that the one-time competitors would join forces ahead of the Australian Open in January.

However, their intriguing partnership was short-lived, ending just six months later in May before the French Open. A flurry of speculation about why they parted ways soon followed.

Despite initial plans to maintain their professional relationship until Wimbledon, a string of disappointing results for Djokovic seems to have prompted a change of heart. Aside from clinching the Geneva Open, and making it to the semi-finals at Roland Garros since ditching the Scot, it's been a tough year overall for the 37-year-old.

Castle, 61, has a hunch that Murray was actually brought on board to provide tips to the 24-time Grand Slam champion, suggesting his role was "not the same" as a traditional coach.

"I don't see it as a coaching relationship," Castle said to Betway. "I don't see those types of relationships; I see it as support and somebody who has been in the trenches as well and understands [what is needed].

"Novak may need an observation now and again and you might say something along the lines of, 'You're 37 now and need to get to the ball earlier on a rally because you don't cover the courts as quickly as you did.;

"That's a truth so there could be observations like that. The tactical nous that Andy had was unbelievable so there can be a little bit of that and no doubt that was a plus.

"That was what I would see as those relationships but it's certainly not the same type of coaching as going down the club and getting the club pro to take me through [some techniques]."

Upon ending his partnership with Murray, Djokovic said: "We felt like we couldn't get more out of that partnership on the court, and that's all there is to it.

"My respect towards Andy remains the same, even more actually, I got to know him as a person. I think he has a brilliant tennis IQ, he has a very rare mind of a champion that obviously has achieved what he has achieved, and he sees the game incredibly well."

Murray, who retired last summer after the 2024 Paris Olympics, has said that the experience hasn't deterred him from considering coaching again in the future.

"I would do it again at some stage," Murray told the BBC. "I don't think that will happen immediately. I wasn't planning on going into coaching as soon as I finished playing but it was a pretty unique opportunity. It was a chance to learn from one of the best athletes of all time.

"It was a brilliant opportunity for me. We got to spend some really nice moments away from the court. Results weren't as we wanted but we gave it a go."

These include Emma Raducanu's stalking ordeal across four countries, verbal abuse directed at world No 1 Iga Swiatek during practice, and death threats received by Katie Boulter.

LONDON (AP)—Wimbledon's prize money has risen to a record 53.5 million pounds (about $73 million) and the singles champions will each earn three million pounds ($4 million), All England Club officials announced on Thursday.The total amount is 3.5 million pounds ($6.8 million) more than last year, an increase of 7%—and exactly twice the pot handed out to competitors at the grass-court Grand Slam 10 years ago."We're immensely proud of the fact that if you look back 10 years, you can see the increase over that period and 7% this year," All England chair Deborah Jevans said. "And we have listened to the players, we have engaged with the players."The 2025 winners' checks represent an 11.1% jump on last year's prizes for the men's and women's singles champions and comes amid growing player demands for a bigger share of grand slam profits.

Players who lose in the first round of singles will get 66,000 pounds, up 10% year on year."The focus on just the prize money at four events, the Grand Slams, does not get to the heart of what the challenge is for tennis," Jevans added."The challenge with tennis is the fact that the players don't have an offseason which they want, they have increasing injuries that they're speaking about, and we've always said that we as Wimbledon are willing to engage and talk with the tours to try and find solutions, and that door remains open."Wimbledon starts on June 30 and runs until July 13. For the first time in the oldest Grand Slam, line judges will be replaced with electronic line-calling.

Lajal, ranked No 195, will play the winner of the match between Australian Alexei Popyrin, the No 4 seed, and Belgian Zizou Bergs next.

Ahead of his victory, the 22-year-old Estonian won against Serb Laslo Djere (6-2, 6-4).

The phasing out of line judges at Wimbledon was an “inevitable” development, All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) chief executive Sally Bolton said Thursday.

This year's Wimbledon will be the first in the tournament's 148-year history not to use line judges, a recognizable part of the event with their smart uniforms and crouched poses. It will instead rely on electronic line calling (ELC), as is used at the Australian and U.S. Opens. The French Open, where shots leave marks on the clay that can be inspected by the umpires, is the only Grand Slam that still uses line judges.

The tournament's pool of 300 judges has been condensed to 80 “match assistants,” two of whom will be assigned to each court. They will support the umpires in managing what happens on the court and are there as a backstop should ELC go down.

Bolton said that the line judges understood the inevitability of their being replaced.

“I think they — and I wouldn't speak for them individually — probably recognise that with the evolution of the technology and the consistent change across many of the other tournaments that this is probably inevitable,” she said at a media briefing ahead of Wimbledon 2025.

“So I think for many of them they had expected this change to come along and for those that will be joining us for the Championships in the match assistant role obviously they're delighted still to be part of delivering the Championships.”

ELC is compulsory at all ATP and mixed tour-level events. Discreet testing was carried out during last year's Wimbledon, where the ball tracking and line technology has been in place for more than 15 years. In 2007, Wimbledon used Hawk-Eye technology for the first time, allowing players to challenge line calls. ELC removes the need for challenges by making the calls in real time; players can request a replay of the call.

“The time is right for us to move on,” Bolton said.

“We absolutely value the commitment that those line umpires have provided to the Championships over many years. And we do have a significant number of them coming back in a new role as match assistants, so we're really pleased to have many of them still involved with delivering the championships.”

ELC has generally been popular with the players, though there were some issues at the clay events this year where the marks left on the court were sometimes in conflict with the images being displayed by the technology. This will not be an issue on grass courts.

Wimbledon has also announced the prize money pool for this year's event, with an increase of seven percent on 2024 to £53.5 million ($72.7 million), which is double the pot of 10 years ago.

The two singles champions will each receive £3 million ($4.1 million) — the most of any Grand Slam, though the U.S. Open is yet to confirm its prize pots for this year's event. It's an 11.1 percent increase from last year. At the lower end of the tournament, there have been similar increases, with first-round losers receiving £66,000 (89,691), a 10 percent increase from last year. Doubles and wheelchair events have seen smaller increases.



The increase in prize money for the singles events follows meetings between executives from the Grand Slams and leading players from both tours. Some of those players met with the Grand Slam representatives, including Bolton and AELTC chair Deborah Jevans, in Paris during the French Open. They both said it was important to continue that dialogue, but Jevans stressed the importance of looking at the “bigger picture” around scheduling and burnout, and not just prize money.

Jevans added that — having been one herself, once reaching the Wimbledon fourth round — she knew that “tennis players, they're always going to, I think, ask for more money.”

At the center of those discussions is the proportion of revenue that the Grand Slams share with players.

Wimbledon's 2025 prize pool represents just over 13 percent of its 2024 turnover of £406.5 million ($553 million), according to accounts filed by The All England Lawn Tennis Club (Championships), the operating company for the event.



Jevans added that Wimbledon has no plans to become a 15-day event like the other Grand Slams. The tournament's priority is resolving the legal battle over their plans to build 39 new grass courts on the old Wimbledon Park golf course, which would almost triple the size of the grounds at the Wimbledon Championships and allow the AELTC to host qualifying on site, as the other majors do.

The Greater London Authority (GLA) granted the AELTC planning permission at a hearing in September 2024, but after appeals led by the Save Wimbledon Park (SWP) group, a judicial review will take place July 8 and July 9 of 2025, in which the AELTC and SWP will outline their arguments. The AELTC expects the judge to make their decision a few weeks later.

A separate issue is the question of whether a statutory trust exists on the golf course land. After appealing to the courts for the case to be expedited, a separate hearing will be held on this matter in January 2026.

The AELTC is desperate to press on with its expansion plans as it continues to lose ground on the other three majors. Jevans said that the need for the transformation “becomes ever more apparent as we see our fellow Grand Slams staging fully integrated three-week events by welcoming many more spectators and staging charity and community events during the qualifying week and, crucially, providing the players with a stage benefiting their sporting excellence.”

The Wimbledon main draw starts Monday June 30.

German 17-year-old Justin Engel reached a quarter-final of an ATP Tour event for the first time in his young career.

He achieved the feat on Thursday at the Stuttgart Open with a 6-4, 6-4 win against seventh seeded American Alex Michelsen.

Engel broke Michelsen in the third game of each set, did not face a break point, and won all 31 points on his first serve en route to victory in 1 hour 17 minutes which he sealed with a service winner.

Wildcard entry Engel named his success "unbelievable" and admitted he had been "very nervous" before the match.

Playing in his first professional grass court event, he became the youngest player to reach an ATP quarter-final on this surface since Boris Becker's first triumph at Wimbledon 40 years ago.

"This is nice to hear," he said, adding that he "simply wants to play tennis and have fun on court."

Thursday's success over 35th ranked Michelsen was his first victory over a top 50 player, and he will rise in the rankings from a current 281st into the top 250.

Engel is among several talented German 17-year-olds. Diego Dedura has also started playing on the ATP Tour, while Niels McDonald and Max Schönhaus contested the junior final at the French Open on Saturday, with McDonald taking the trophy.

Germany's top player Alexander Zverev was set to play later Thursday against Frenchman Corentin Moutet in Stuttgart, which is one of the tune-up events for Wimbledon which starts on June 30.

Venus Williams' boyfriend, Andrea Preti, reacted to her photodump, which included multiple outfits the American wore during the French Open. She was a part of a broadcast team at Roland Garros this year.

The 44-year-old American, who has not retired from playing, shared a carousel of images on Instagram showcasing her outfits in Paris. She campaigned for Lacoste at the 2025 French Open and was also a broadcaster for TNT Sports. Her images included an iconic click with the Eiffel Tower in the background.

Her boyfriend, Danish-born actor and director, Preti, commented on the post with a leaf and heart emoji.

Venus' sister Serena Williams also commented on the post:

Venus Williams was in Paris during the 2025 French Open, where Coco Gauff won her second Grand Slam title and Carlos Alcaraz defended his title successfully. The 44-year-old American was part of the broadcasting team of TNT Sports along with Andre Agassi.

Meanwhile, there were rumors earlier this year that Williams had retired from the sport, but she quashed them during an interview with TNT.

Williams last played at the Miami Open in 2024, where she was ousted in the first round. Before that, she was ousted from the first round of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.

In February 2025, Venus Williams ignited engagement rumors, as she wore a ring on her left hand during a training session in Rome with boyfriend Andrea Preti. The ring remained on her finger as the actor watched from the stands.

Williams and Preti have been rumored to be together since July 2024, after being spotted vacationing. The pair traveled to the Bahamas in January 2025, where Williams referred to Preti as "the best company" in an Instagram selfie.

The February ring sighting was followed by their appearance at Milan Fashion Week, where the couple was spotted together on the red carpet. They shared a kiss, confirming their relationship. Although neither has confirmed an engagement, it remains to be seen if they announce something soon.

Emma Raducanu: The Sensational Rise of a Tennis Prodigy

In a whirlwind of talent and determination, Emma Raducanu took the tennis world by storm with her historic victory at the US Open. From her humble beginnings in Toronto, Canada, to her triumph on the courts of Flushing Meadows, Raducanu has captured the hearts of fans worldwide.

Born on November 13th, 2002, Raducanu stands tall at 175 cm and weighs around 52 kg. A versatile athlete, she dabbled in various sports before committing to tennis at the age of five. Inspired by legends like Simona Halep, Li Na, Andy Murray, and Serena Williams, Raducanu honed her skills and set her sights on greatness.

Fluent in English, Romanian, and Mandarin Chinese, Raducanu's multicultural background adds depth to her compelling story. Her unprecedented victory at the US Open in 2021, where she didn't drop a single set on her path to glory, shattered records and redefined what's possible for a young talent in the sport.

Despite facing setbacks, including severe injuries that required surgery on both wrists and an ankle, Raducanu's resilience knows no bounds. While she reached a career-high ranking of No. 10, she continues to strive for excellence and inspire a new generation of tennis enthusiasts.

Off the court, Raducanu remains grounded, pursuing interests in golf, skiing, horse riding, and basketball. A philanthropist at heart, she founded the Emma Raducanu Foundation to support orphan care and has dedicated herself to charitable endeavors.

However, fame comes at a price, as Raducanu faced a harrowing stalking incident during a match in Dubai. Despite the challenges, she emerged stronger and more determined to succeed both on and off the court.

As the world watches in awe, Emma Raducanu's journey is far from over. With unwavering passion and a drive to make a difference, she continues to captivate audiences and etch her name in the annals of tennis history.

 OAKMONT, Pa. — The first shot of the 125th U.S. Open on Thursday embodied so much of what this championship is about. Matt Vogt, an Indiana dentist who went through 54 holes of qualifying, sent his tee shot soaring into the rough at Oakmont. 

 Vogt, who once caddied at Oakmont before moving on to root canals, managed to use the severe slope of the first fairway for his ball to tumble onto the green for a par. 

 There are high expectations everywhere at the major known as the toughest test in golf — for Scottie Scheffler, the world No. 1; for Bryson DeChambeau, the defending champion; and for everyone to face an Oakmont course reputed to be the toughest in the land. 

 “Oakmont is relentless,” said John Bodenhamer, the chief championships officer at the USGA who sets up the course. “There's no let up. It's a grind. That's the U.S. Open.” 

 The USGA is particularly fond of Oakmont, a big reason why the U.S. Open returns to his course for a record 10th time. 

 It has been on the minds of all 156 players — from Scheffler and Masters champion Rory McIlroy to the 15 amateurs, and for the 16 players, like Vogt, who had to make it through 18 holes of local qualifying and then 36 holes. 

 Zac Blair had the first birdie of this championship, holing a putt from nearly 45 feet on the 10th hole after starting his round on the back nine. 

 Alistair Docherty suffered the first of what figures to be plenty of crashes. From just short of the 10th green, it took him two hacks to get it out of the cabbage-like rough, the second chip rolling and rolling some 12 feet by the hole. 

 That's what Oakmont does — thick, gnarly rough and some of the fastest putting surfaces around. The USGA pointed out on the eve of the championship that only 27 of the 1,385 players who have competed in a major championship at Oakmont finished under par.

Tennis legend Jimmy Connors has urged the bosses of big tournaments like Wimbledon and the French Open to consider delaying post-match interviews for the losing finalist. His suggestion comes after Aryna Sabalenka caused uproar by suggesting that her Roland-Garros defeat was down to her own mistakes, rather than Coco Gauff's superiority.

An emotional Sabalenka blew a one-set lead over Gauff to lose 7-6 2-6 4-6 on Saturday. Afterwards, she said: "I think she won the match not because she played incredible, just because I made all of those mistakes. If Iga [Swiatek] would have beaten me [in the semis], I think she would go out and get the win [in the final]."

Former tennis star and coach Rennae Stubbs was among those to publicly criticise Sabalenka, saying: "That was so bad, and there's no excuses for it. Like, there's just none. No, no, no. And that's coming from me who, as I said, I've said some stuff in press. Like, you never take it away from your opponent."

But American hero Connors, who won eight Grand Slam singles titles during a glittering career, does not believe that the blame lies solely on Sabalenka's shoulders. And the 72-year-old feels that players could benefit from being given time to let the dust settle before stepping up to the microphone.

He told Advantage Connors: "After a tough match, whether it's the finals of the French or Wimbledon or whatever, everyone wants to hear your thoughts right away.

"Maybe it would be better to give you five minutes and let the players take a breath – but they [the media] want to hear it right away, they want the scoop. And then they are critical of it. That's why it's always been a crawl in my whatever.

"These guys think they know what they are talking about when they have not done it. You can sit there and say I have seen this and I have watched so much tennis, I know what's in your mind. You don't know what's in my mind! You have no clue."

Gauff, who is now a two-time Grand Slam champion at only 21 years old, did not buy into Sabalenka's comments. She said: "I don't agree with that. I'm sitting here [as the winner].

"Last time I played - no shade to Iga or anything, but I played her and I won in straight sets. Yeah, I don't think that's a fair thing to say, because anything can really happen."

Emma Raducanu will be hoping to attack the grass-court season this year, given it is a surface she has enjoyed success on in the past.

And, given it is only a short part of the tennis calendar, the opportunities to compete on it are sparse.

In the past, Eastbourne and Nottingham have been a large part of her Wimbledon preparation, but this year she has also opted to take part in Queen's, which is allowing women to compete for the first time since 1973.

It was a historic opportunity that the Brit could not pass up, but one decision she has made might be risking her chances of playing in the next big Grand Slam.

After all, her latest fitness update was far from ideal.

Speaking ahead of Queen's earlier this week, Emma Raducanu admitted: ‘I got back from Paris last week and then I got straight back on the court.

‘I had a small interruption with a bit of a back spasm again, which was a bit annoying and that hindered my grass prep. But the last few days I have managed to get on the grass.

‘I can't really predict the future. I know I have been managing my back for the last few weeks now and it's something that comes and goes.

‘It can be frustrating. I try not to let it get to me because I have a pretty good feel when it happens of how to manage it. All I can do is deal with what's in front of me.

‘Today was the first day I opened it up and played points on the grass. It is pretty early days and I can't say I have had a lot of prep on it.'

She therefore admitted that she is not putting too much pressure on results in the coming weeks, noting: ‘Of course you want to win this tournament, like every tournament, but especially when it's at home. But my expectations are pretty low.'

Raducanu headlines an already strong Queen's lineup this year as the women return to action at this event.

It feels like, when expectations are low is when Raducanu thrives.

Nobody expected a qualifier to win the US Open, yet she accomplished it. Nobody expected her to reach the fourth round of Wimbledon last year with such ease, yet the 22-year-old managed to.

Clearly thriving in the underdog role, it feels like she will certainly be given that mantle once again heading into these next few events.

However, with such a recurring back injury, there's a worry that she might actually be putting too much on her plate ahead of Wimbledon.

After all, even if they exit early, Raducanu's decision to play doubles with Katie Boulter at Queen's alongside singles might be putting additional unnecessary effort onto a body that has broken down routinely in the past.

And with Eastbourne and the German Open potentially to come too, all before Wimbledon, there's a fear that she may be risking too much.

Annabel Croft certainly thought as much, noting after her first win: ‘[There wasn't] any sign of that whatsoever, if her back was really bad, I don't think we'd see her be playing doubles with Katie Boulter, you wouldn't want to stress your body any more than you would want to. I think some of these niggles, it's a little bit like when you agree to run the marathon, you start feeling like your legs and knees are hurting before you go out there to run it.'

Decisions like this can either go one of two ways: she could find form and fitness and put herself in the perfect position for a strong campaign at the All England Club, or struggle once again to be fit enough to compete.

Hopefully, it's the former that rings true by the time Wimbledon comes around.

From extending his winning streak at non-hard-court majors to 28 matches in a row to becoming the first man in the Open Era to save three match points to win a Grand Slam final, the 22-year-old Spaniard achieved A LOT in Paris this year.ByJohn BerkokPublished Jun 12, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 12, 2025

Carlos Alcaraz lit up Roland Garros this year, playing lights-out tennis en route to capturing the fifth Grand Slam title of his career—and capping it by fighting off triple match point to defeat reigning world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in an epic final, 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2).Here are 25 amazing things the Spaniard achieved in Paris:He's now 5-0 in Grand Slam finals. He beat Casper Ruud to win the US Open in 2022, Novak Djokovic to win Wimbledon in 2023, Alexander Zverev to win Roland Garros in 2024, Djokovic (again) to win Wimbledon in 2024, and now Sinner to win Roland Garros in 2025.He's just the second man in the Open Era to win his first five Grand Slam finals in a row. Roger Federer is the only other man to do that, winning his first seven in a row before finally losing his eighth.He's the third man this century to successfully defend a Roland Garros title. Gustavo Kuerten did it once (2001) and Rafael Nadal did it 10 times (2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018, 2019 and 2020).He's the fourth man this century to win five or more majors. He joins the usual suspects, the Big 3—Federer (who won 20 career majors), Nadal (22 career majors) and Djokovic (24 career majors).He's also the fourth man this century to win at least one major for four consecutive years. That's after the Big 3, too. Nadal had the longest streak of the trio at 10 straight years from 2005 to 2014.He won his fifth Grand Slam title at the exact same age—to the day—as Nadal did. Alcaraz was 22 years, one month and three days when he won his fifth major last Sunday, and Nadal was 22 years, one month and three days when he won his fifth major at Wimbledon in 2008.And with that, he ties Nadal for second-youngest man ever to win five majors. Bjorn Borg still holds that honor, winning his fifth Grand Slam title at Roland Garros in 1978 at 22 years and five days.

Next up, some things he achieved specifically in the final…He won the longest final in Roland Garros history. At 5:29, it was also the second-longest Grand Slam final in history, after the 2012 Australian Open final, where Djokovic outlasted Nadal in 5:53.He won the first Grand Slam men's final between players born in the 2000s. Between the two of them, Alcaraz and Sinner have now won the last six majors in a row, and eight total—but all of the opponents they beat in those finals were born in either the 1980s or the 1990s.Having battled back from triple match point down serving at 3-5, 0-40 in the fourth set against Sinner, Alcaraz is the first man in the Open Era to save three match points to win a Grand Slam final. He's the third man in the Open Era to save any number of match points to win a Grand Slam final, after Gaston Gaudio (who saved two against Guillermo Coria in the 2004 Roland Garros final) and Djokovic (who saved two against Federer in the 2019 Wimbledon final).The final was also the first time he's won a match from two sets to love down.

And finally, a few more mindblowing stats…Alcaraz is now 4-1 in his career against reigning No. 1s. Broken down by opponent, that includes 1-1 against Djokovic while he was No. 1, and 3-0 against Sinner since he rose to the top spot last June.He's now 12-2 in “big” finals. That includes 5-0 in Grand Slam finals, 7-1 in Masters 1000 finals and 0-1 in Olympic finals. He's 2-2 against Djokovic in “big” finals and 10-0 against everyone else.He's now 13-1 in five-setters. The only five-setter he's ever lost came to Matteo Berrettini in the third round of the 2022 Australian Open, 6-2, 7-6 (3), 4-6, 2-6, 7-6 (5). He's won 10 in a row since.He's now won 20 career titles, the first man born in the 2000s to do that. He just edged out Sinner to that milestone, as the Italian was also going for his 20th career title in the Roland Garros final.He's won 28 matches in a row at non-hard-court majors. His last loss at a major away from hard courts came to Djokovic at Roland Garros in 2023—since then he's won Wimbledon in 2023, Roland Garros and Wimbledon in 2024, and now Roland Garros again in 2025.And finally, he's now 37-5 in 2025—which is by far the most wins on the men's tour this year. No other man even has 30 yet. Zverev is going for his 30th of the year in Stuttgart on Thursday.

Formula 1 makes the trip from Europe to North America this weekend for Round 10 on the calendar, the Canadian Grand Prix. Ahead of the race, Need to Know is your all-in-one guide with statistics, driving pointers, strategy tips and plenty more.

Free Practice 1 and 2 will take place on Friday, June 13, followed by Free Practice 3 and Qualifying on Saturday, June 14, and the Grand Prix itself on Sunday, June 15.

IT'S RACE WEEK: 5 storylines we're excited about ahead of the 2025 Canadian Grand Prix

Jolyon Palmer, former Renault F1 driver: Canada is a really nice track to drive and you get a sense of atmosphere going around it. Overhanging trees give it the feel of a park and it feels like a street circuit – in essence, it is.

There are a lot of slow-speed corners, the walls are very close in a lot of places, but it's a great racetrack. You need a good front-end to get your car turned into the chicanes, which are pretty much everywhere.

Then there's the hairpin, which launches you into an overtaking area at the final chicane. If not there, maybe you'll have a little sniff of something into Turn 1. Turns 1 and 2 are pretty tricky because you're approaching Turn 1 very, very fast, arcing to the right as you're braking, and then hurling speed to the left.

If you have any sort of moment coming to Turn 1, you're really off-line or cutting the corner down towards Turn 2. And tyre warm-up sometimes isn't ideal here, particularly on chillier days in Montreal.

F1 NATION: Piastri vs Norris to heat up? Why shouldn't Verstappen be ruled out in Montreal? It's our Canadian Grand Prix preview

Verstappen and Russell set the exact same time in Qualifying for the 2024 Canadian Grand Prix, but it was Verstappen who won on race day

“For the third time this season, the softest trio of compounds will feature on track,” reads Pirelli's weekend preview. “That means, after appearing for the first time in Imola and again in Monaco, the C6 will be in use, alongside its closest relatives, the C5 as medium and the C4 as hard.

“The selection is therefore one step softer than last year when the chosen compounds were the C3, C4 and C5. This weekend, when using the new C6, teams and drivers will be able to make the most of the information and data gathered at its two previous appearances.

“The Gilles-Villeneuve Circuit is a track where the lateral forces exerted on the tyres are medium to low, while the longitudinal ones are a bit more severe, although not particularly high, because of the cars being subjected to strong deceleration followed by sharp acceleration.

“The track surface is very smooth and not very abrasive and is never used for racing apart from the Grand Prix weekend. Graining, especially during free practice on Friday, could put in an appearance, but as the track gradually rubbers-in it shouldn't be a factor. Lap times come down really quickly, not just from one day to the next, but also during each session.

“On top of that, the unpredictable and changeable weather is a factor to consider, a wildcard that's been known to disrupt the on-track action here, while fluctuating temperatures are a feature of the Montreal event.”

The picture at the very top of the championship standings remains unchanged after Round 9 in Spain, with Oscar Piastri consolidating his lead by taking his fifth victory of the season. This has boosted his points tally to a total of 186.

McLaren team mate Lando Norris, meanwhile, only sits 10 points behind in second place. The Briton took P2 in the 2024 Canadian Grand Prix but will surely be looking to go one better this year as an intra-team duel continues to brew at the Woking-based outfit.

That battle could be set to intensify even further, given that the pair have broken away slightly from Max Verstappen in the standings. The Dutchman lost ground in Barcelona after being handed a 10-second time penalty following a collision with George Russell, dropping him from an original result of P5 down to P10.

While he still sits third in the championship, Verstappen is now 49 points adrift of Piastri, and his punishment in Spain has also resulted in the Red Bull driver being just one penalty point away from an automatic race suspension. However, Verstappen holds a strong record at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, having consecutively won the Grand Prix for the past three years. Can he bounce back at this weekend's event?

Another team to have enjoyed good form in Montreal previously are Mercedes, with Russell taking third ahead of then-team mate Lewis Hamilton in 2024. The squad will be hoping that the conditions favour them as they look to get ahead in an intriguing fight between themselves, Red Bull and Ferrari.

The latter jumped their rivals to take P2 in the Teams' Standings following Charles Leclerc's podium result at the Spanish Grand Prix, though Hamilton cut a downbeat figure after what was a tough triple header sequence for the seven-time World Champion. How will the Scuderia fare this weekend?

Elsewhere, Williams will be keen to reaffirm their status as the leaders of the midfield following a difficult outing in Barcelona, while things remain very much all to play for behind them as Racing Bulls try to fend off their rivals in the scrap for P6.

But the Pole's next visit to Montreal was much more enjoyable as he grabbed a spot on the front row of the grid and took advantage of drama around him – including an unusual collision between Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Raikkonen in the pit lane – to emerge victorious.

DRIVER MARKET: Who's on Cadillac's driver shortlist as they prepare for 2026 F1 entry?

It would go down as Kubica's one and only Grand Prix win, with his and BMW Sauber's challenge for 2008 title glory fading as the year went on and rival teams out-developed them, but it remains a memorable moment for himself and his home country.

Political Editor


	The House of Representatives put the future of the public broadcasting ecosystem in doubt, as they voted to rescind $1.1 billion in federal funding for the next two fiscal years.


	The vote was 214-212. The bill, which also includes cuts to foreign aid, now heads to the Senate. 


	It looked as if the votes was heading to defeat, but House Speaker Mike Johnson convinced some members to change their votes, only the latest instance of him intervening at the last minute to save parts of Donald Trump‘s agenda.


	The bill claws back $535 million in funding for fiscal year 2026 and $535 million in funding for fiscal year 2027. Congress had already allocated the money to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the non profit entity set up to distribute funds to PBS, NPR and stations.

					House Set To Vote On Bill To Rescind Funding To PBS, NPR And Public Broadcasting Stations		
			








	Trump has sought to eliminate federal funding to PBS and NPR via executive order, but the White House, deeming the networks biased to the left, sent a package of rescissions last week to roll back funding to CPB. With congressional approval, that would put the cuts on a sounder legal footing than an executive order.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Public broadcasting has found itself in the crosshairs many times before, as the elimination of funding has been a long-held desire from the right. The House voted to cut NPR funding in 2011. Mitt Romney argued for eliminating funding during his 2012 presidential campaign. The Trump administration proposed zeroing out public broadcasting funding for each of the four years of his first term. 


	But with lobbying from parents, viewers and such characters as Big Bird, public media has survived amid bipartisan support from lawmakers who have cited their support for public media outlets in their own communities.


	That is why the leaders of CPB, NPR and PBS have been emphasizing the impact of the cuts on local stations, which get the lion's share of the federal funds. 


	But those arguments may be unable to overcome a long-held desire on the right to eliminate the funding. That has been exacerbated by the attacks from the right on the signature piece of Trump's legislation, a tax and spending package that figures like Elon Musk have argued would bankrupt the federal government. That seems to have put pressure on GOP lawmakers to show examples of their fiscal restraint, even as Democrats have attacked them for the package of rescissions cuts.

	











	During debate on the House floor, Republicans cited instances that they say proved public media bias. But the action also reflected Trump's latest effort to undermine media outlets he does not like. His FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, has launched investigations of Comcast and Disney, among others, over their DEI practices. 


	Some GOP lawmakers, though, said that the situation with public broadcasting was different, framing it as a matter of using tax dollars to back media outlets they say promote a left-wing agenda.


	“They have a right to say what they want; they do not have a right to our tax dollars,” said Rep. Brandon Gill (R-TX).


	Democrats defended public media, but in the House debate, put the greatest emphasis on the impact of rescissions to global health programs and AIDS prevention. In total, the rescissions package cuts $9.4 billion in funding.


	Public media advocates, though, say that detractors have cherry picked instances when overall, trust in NPR and PBS remains high. A Pew survey in March put PBS high on the list of trusted news sources, along with the BBC. NPR also scored well, ranking with The Wall Street Journal and the Associated Press.


	The Senate can pass the bill by simple majority, or it can merely not act on it. Congress has 45 days to act on Trump's rescissions request, meaning that the Senate has five more weeks to pass it, or the funding will go to public media as planned.

Mel Brooks will mark the 40th anniversary of Spaceballs with … another Spaceballs. The filmmaker announced Thursday that a sequel was in the works for 2027. “After 40 years, we asked, ‘What do the fans want?'” he said in a video clip. “But instead we're making this movie.”


	The teaser runs like a Star Wars space scroll, summarizing all the sequels and series that have come out since Brooks spoofed that franchise with Spaceballs in the Eighties. “Thirty-eight years ago, there was only one Star Wars trilogy,” it says. “But since then, there have been … a prequel trilogy, a sequel trilogy, a sequel to the prequel, a prequel to the sequel, countless TV spinoffs, a movie spinoff of the TV spinoff, which is both a prequel and a sequel.” And this is in addition to two Dunes, seven Jurassic Parks, five Avatars, and so much more. (One sequel curiously absent from the crawl is Brooks' own History of the World, Part II.) It ends with, “But in thirty-eight years, there has only ever been one … Spaceballs.)

	











	Other than Brooks' appearance (wearing Spaceballs: The Sweatshirt) at the end of the clip announcing the sequel, the only fact, other than the movie is in the works, that the teaser shares is that it will be only in theaters. So there's plenty of room for speculation about how involved Brooks, who'll be 100 by 2027, will be.


Josh Gad, who worked on the movie with Brooks, wrote about how excited he is for the movie to come out on Instagram. “I was that child who saw Spaceballs before I ever saw Star Wars and then wondered why anyone would do a dramatic remake of the Mel Brooks classic,” he wrote. “It is therefore the greatest gift of my life to now help take the reins and work alongside Mel and this incredible group to do a sequel to the movie that first inspired George Lucas.”

	











The Guardian reports that Josh Greenbaum, who directed Strays and Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, is directing the picture. The cast, however, remains unconfirmed. Although John Candy, who played Barf, and Joan Rivers, who voiced the C-3PO-like Dot Matrix, have both died, the principal cast members, including Brooks, Bill Pullman, and Daphne Zuniga, are still alive.

	So is Rick Moranis, the movie's Dark Helmet, who began a hiatus from acting in 1997. He'd previously agreed to appear in Shrunk,a reboot of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids in 2020, but that production has yet to materialize. Moranis declined to make a cameo in 2016's Ghostbusters reboot. He has, however, done voice acting, recorded comedy albums, and made the occasional appearance as one half of his and Dave Thomas' beloved Bob and Doug McKenzie characters. And he did provide the voice of Lord Dark Helmet for an episode of The Goldbergs.


	Although rumors are already swirling online about Moranis' involvement, nothing is confirmed. In any case, as Brooks' Yogurt character says, may the Schwartz be with him and everyone involved in Spaceballs 2.

A tender and gently probing Norwegian drama about a pair of Oslo chimney sweeps whose lives are forever changed when they casually open up to each other in between jobs one morning, Dag Johan Haugerud's “Sex” — the standalone first installment of the director's Kieślowski-inspired “Sex, Love, Dreams” trilogy — is a far cry from the prurient spectacle promised by its title. Indeed, this sweet and chatty film, in which sex is often discussed but never depicted, could just as easily have been called “Love” or “Dreams” (that it wasn't seems like a joke typical of Haugerud's dry sense of humor). 

 










But that isn't to accuse the director of a bait-and-switch. As Oscar Wilde is quoted to have said: “Everything is about sex, except sex.” In that sense, “Sex” is more about sex than it ever could have been if it contained any sex. While “Sex” may be light on the act itself, the movie is deeply — almost spiritually — engaged in what it means to people, and why it plays such an outsized role in the way that we self-identify and see each other.

“Sex” is a story about the parts of ourselves that we decide to share with each other, and even more so a story about the vulnerability of sharing them. It starts with the higher-ranked of the two chimney sweeps (the handsome Thorbjørn Harr, whose rugged dad aesthetic belies his character's youthful naivete) talking his similarly unnamed subordinate (Jan Gunnar Røise) through a dream he had the previous night — a dream in which a divine figure who may or may not have been David Bowie looked at him as if he were an attractive woman. Lust is familiar to a straight man like the CEO (as he's referred to in the credits), but the sense of being desired is elusive enough to retain its mysteries.  

What inspires the CEO to share this information with his colleague? Perhaps he just needed to hear what it sounded like out loud (“It's strange how dreams change when you start talking about them,” he observes). We certainly get the impression that it's a radical change of pace to the usual conversations between these men, which Haugerud's sterile, interrogative framing suggests are more focused on avoiding feelings than sharing them. 

But Røise's character, whose plain demeanor obscures the potential richness of his inner life, is eager to make the most of the strange new energy that his boss has created. As if to put the CEO at ease, he counters with an unexpected confession of his own: He had sex with a male customer the previous day. He insists that he isn't gay (“Having one beer doesn't make someone an alcoholic” the man says without a hint of defensiveness, anticipating a movie in which homosexual urges are a freighted invitation for self-understanding rather than something to be exorcised or submitted to), but, much like what happened in the boss' dream, he was activated by the fact of being wanted by a stranger. 

 










A different kind of film might have used that coincidence to spark a furtive romance between the two men, but “Sex” is more interested in seeing how these men — especially the underling — process their feelings on their own time. Røise's chimney sweep immediately tells his wife (Siri Forberg, introduced in a long-take that hides her face from view) about the encounter, assuming that she'll be as bewildered by it as he is. He's right about that, but wrong to think that his wife will share the feeling that his impromptu tryst was some type of alien event — a spontaneous happening so out of character that it might as well have happened to someone else. 

It's not the act itself that upsets her so much as the intimacy he experienced without her; she ascribes to Milan Kundera's view that sex is rooted in a mutually shared mystery, and after 20 years of marriage she resents the idea that someone else knows what her husband's face looks like when he comes. Betrayed and wounded but never shrill or judgmental, she initially demands that he fill in the blanks of her imagination (How did they arrange their bodies? Was his ass sore afterwards?), only to later confront herself with the idea that loving someone might require her to set them free. 

 










Her husband swears that he has no interest in repeating the experience, but his insistence further exacerbates the woman's questions — often pained, but never shouted or showy — about why and how we limit ourselves to accommodate each other. What motivates people to share their secrets, and what right do married partners have to keep some part of themselves to themselves? 

That last question looms particularly large over the course of a film that loves its characters for their anguished curiosity, and delights in being freed from the burden of having to draw its own conclusions in order to resolve a clear plot. Endowed with the flushed ambivalence of Peder Capjon Kjellsby's jazz fusion score, “Sex” makes it clear from the start that Haugerud sees the film's various discussions as the reason for making it in the first place, and not as a means to an end; he couldn't care less whether the chimney sweep and his wife separate at the end, but he's fascinated by how emotional the man gets when his wife reveals that she's going to discuss the situation with one of her friends. “You're making it your story,” he cries, as if that were a greater betrayal than cheating on her. As if love itself weren't a desperately beautiful effort to create something bigger than our bodies. 

 










“Sex” is her story, of course. It's also — in a more literal way — also the CEO's story as well, as the film is almost equally involved with his efforts to make sense of his dream, the effects of which assume a tangible dimension when the CEO starts to feel his voice change in the days leading up to a concert recital. 

That plot, and its nested digression about the CEO's teenage son, can't help but feel a bit unformed in comparison to his colleague's marital problems, but there's an effervescent joy in Harr's performance as a conservative man who's taking stock of himself for the first time in his life, and that effervescence is complemented by the summer warmth of Cecilie Semac's cinematography. You can almost feel the CEO peeling away a sunburn as he sheds a layer of dead skin, and his newfound openness allows Haugerud to use him as a conduit for the various thoughts that “Sex” has on its mind. 

The CEO's journey is much more private than his co-worker's (nobody wants to hear about somebody else's dreams, and he has to beg his own wife to care about the one with Bowie), but it also welcomes so many other people into the conversation at the same time. Those people include a music teacher who lectures him on Hannah Arendt, and a wildly oversharing doctor who ruminates on the sensation of having sex during the third trimester of a pregnancy, and tells the CEO a long story about a patient of hers who once made the mistake of getting a massive tattoo in tribute to his partner. 

 










On their own, these episodes don't amount to very much, but “Sex” layers them in with the chimney sweep's dilemma to increasingly stirring effect, as Haugerud leverages the usual array of heteronormative hangups into a searching rumination on the vulnerability of sharing the multitudes that we each contain. This isn't a movie that's for or against monogamy, so much as it's a touching — and, during its final minutes, even vaguely transcendental — study of how we're all too infinite to stay bottled up within ourselves. It's a knowing smile of a drama that leaves you eager to follow Haugerud through his other two new films about the life of the mind, the last and best of which (“Dreams”) recently won top prize at the Berlinale. As that doctor tells the CEO when describing what it's like for a woman to have intercourse at the same time as there's a fully-developed fetus in her belly: “It's amazing all the people your body can and has to accommodate.” 

Strand Releasing will release “Sex” in select theaters on Friday, June 13.

EXCLUSIVE: Dexter's Laboratory creator Genndy Tartakovsky is developing Heist Safari for Adult Swim. 


	The show is described as an “animated high octane action comedy,” telling the story of three frog brothers who rob a bank. “Seems simple enough, but the execution is special as !#&$??!!!!,” reads the logline. 


	The show comes a year after it was pitched on stage to Adult Swim President Michael Ouweleen at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival.


	One year on, Tartakovsky has been almost omnipresent at this year's Annecy. He has been promoting his Netflix movie Fixed, which is part of his Sony Animation deal, and sat on a standing-room-only panel celebrating 25 years of Cartoon Network Studios.

	











	Tartakovsky is an animation icon who has been behind hits including Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack and Hotel Transylvania. On the Cartoon Network panel, he said he feels he has been given a new lease of life. “It feels like when I was younger, I feel like that energy makes me still want to do new things,” he said.

	Annecy concludes later this week.

	There's a stunning moment in Sabrina Carpenter‘s Short n' Sweet tour, when she performs the heartbreak anthem “Lie to Girls.” She stands on stage strumming an acoustic guitar, as the crowd sings every word of the ballad: “You don't have to lie to girls/If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves.”


	In her new Rolling Stone cover story, Carpenter notes that this particular portion of the show is rarely captured on video or photographed. That's because a majority of the crowd is fixated instead on the sexual aspects of the Short n' Sweet shows, from Carpenter's outfits (corseted bodysuits glittering in sequins, garter belts, lacy baby-doll nighties) to her horny choreography, like when she acts out sex positions to “Juno,” her indie pop gem about getting pregnant. You might have noticed that she's received some backlash over this on the internet, which is something Carpenter can only laugh about.


	“It's always so funny to me when people complain,” she told RS. “They're like, ‘All she does is sing about this.' But those are the songs that you've made popular. Clearly you love sex. You're obsessed with it. It's in my show. There's so many more moments than the ‘Juno' positions, but those are the ones you post every night and comment on. I can't control that. If you come to the show, you'll [also] hear the ballads, you'll hear the more introspective numbers. I find irony and humor in all of that, because it seems to be a recurring theme. I'm not upset about it, other than I feel mad pressure to be funny sometimes.”

	Carpenter also touched on the broader reality of being a woman in the music industry. “I don't want to be pessimistic, but I truly feel like I've never lived in a time where women have been picked apart more, and scrutinized in every capacity,” she said. “I'm not just talking about me. I'm talking about every female artist that is making art right now.”

	She continued: “We're in such a weird time where you would think it's girl power, and women supporting women, but in reality, the second you see a picture of someone wearing a dress on a carpet, you have to say everything mean about it in the first 30 seconds that you see it.”


	Elsewhere in the story, Carpenter also discussed her new era, which she kicked off last week with the spicy single “Manchild,” followed by her announcement of her new album, Man's Best Friend, out Aug. 29. “It's all about what feels right,” she said. “I'm learning to listen to that a lot more, instead of what is perceived as the right or wrong move.”

It is the end of an era for one former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” couple. Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann have finally exited the Georgia mansion that was the backdrop for numerous fights and police calls.

According to Page Six, the US Marshals intervened and removed them from the home on April 8, 2025. As per a court filing, four deputy marshals “ejected” Zolciak and Biermann from the Atlanta mansion from 3:30 p.m. to 6:45 p.m.

The former reality star and the ex-NFL player finally sold their mansion in February 2025 for $2.75 million — $3 million less than the original asking price — after it was on the market for a year and a half.

The 15,000-square-foot home is a luxurious property with a heated pool, five fireplaces, a six-car garage, an elevator, an arcade room, a movie theater, a gym, and more.

The new owners of the Atlanta estate began the process of legally removing the former couple from the home last December, according to new court documents obtained by Page Six. In the filing, the new owners claimed that Zolcial and Biermann held “the premises over and beyond the term for which they rented to them.”

They also claimed that the estranged couple had already been served the papers for the “proceeding against a tenant holding over.” Those filings from the owners went unanswered.

According to Page Six, Kroy Biermann filed for divorce from Kim in the summer of 2023, and now that the issues with their Georgia mansion have been resolved, the exes are finally able to focus on what they hope is a positive future. 

Kim has relocated to a rental property with their four minor children: Kroy Jr. (also known as KJ), 14, Kash, 12, and 11-year-old twins Kaia and Kane. They also share daughters Brielle, 28, and Ariana, 23, whom Biermann adopted back in 2012. It might be the perfect time for her to return to television, with a camera following her as she rebuilds her now-single life. 

According to Ariana Biermann, Kroy has stepped away from the drama and is living a quiet life by himself. The ex-reality star has also undergone a serious career change. He now oversees logistics and helps with improving workplace efficiency at Superior Rigging and Erecting Co.

EXCLUSIVE: Bill Pullman and Rick Moranis are set to reprise their respective roles as Lone Starr and Dark Helmet in the new Spaceballs movie from Amazon MGM Studios, with Keke Palmer (One of Them Days) joining the cast, sources tell Deadline.


	Amazon declined to comment, and character details for Palmer are under wraps, as is the sequel's plot. The addition of Moranis is particularly striking, as the actor hasn't been seen much on screen for decades. As announced this morning, the original film's director and star, Mel Brooks, will also feature in the cast once again, reprising his role as Yogurt. Slated for release in theaters in 2027, the film has been described by those who have not yet read the script as “A Non-Prequel Non-Reboot Sequel Part Two but with Reboot Elements Franchise Expansion Film.”

	











	Josh Greenbaum (Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar) will direct from a script by Benji Samit, Dan Hernandez, and Josh Gad, as announced in June of last year. Gad is also expected to star and will produce alongside Imagine Entertainment's Brian Grazer and Jeb Brody, Brooks, and Greenbaum, with Kevin Salter, Adam Merims, Samit, and Hernandez exec producing.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Released by MGM in 1987, the original Spaceballs is an iconic send-up of the sci-fi genre, which took inspiration from the Star Wars franchise and other classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey. The plot revolves around the evil Dark Helmet (Moranis) and President Skroob (Brooks), who attempt to steal the atmosphere of the peaceful planet Druidia, only to be thwarted by the hero Lone Starr (Pullman), his sidekick Barf (John Candy), and the Druish princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga). Others in the cast included Joan Rivers and Dick Van Patten. The film grossed just over $38.1 worldwide but has endured over the years as a cult classic.


	Otherwise best known for turns in iconic works like Independence Day and David Lynch's Lost Highway, Pullman has most recently been seen starring in series like The Sinner, as well as films including The High Note and Dark Waters. Upcoming, he has the Duffer Brothers' Netflix series The Boroughs, A24's Famous opposite Zac Efron, and more.

	











	An icon of the '80s and '90s, Moranis rose to fame with roles in Ghostbusters, Little Shop of Horrors, the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids films and more, after writing and starring in famed Canadian sketch series SCTV. Famously, he for the most part stepped away from acting in the late '90s, focusing on raising his children following the passing of his wife, costume designer Ann Belsky. Most recently, he teamed with Ryan Reynolds on a 2020 ad for Mint Mobile. 


	Palmer is coming off of success with One of Them Days, a TriStar buddy comedy where she stars opposite SZA, which recently got a sequel set up for development. Next up, she'll be seen in The Pickup, Amazon's heist comedy out August 6, opposite Eddie Murphy; Aziz Ansari's Lionsgate comedy Good Fortune, out October 17; and Boots Riley's Neon pic I Love Boosters.


	Pullman is repped by CAA; Moranis by Bailey Brand Management and Nelson Davis; and Palmer by 3 Arts and Hertz Lichtenstein.

Mel Brooks is set to reprise his role as Yogurt in Amazon MGM Studios‘ new Spaceballs movie, the studio  announced today.


	Brooks, who directed and starred in the original film, had already been set to produce. Parodying Star Wars‘ Jedi Master Yoda, his character Yogurt is an alien who in the original served as a mentor to protagonist Lone Starr (Bill Pullman). Described by those who have not yet read the script as “A Non-Prequel Non-Reboot Sequel Part Two but with Reboot Elements Franchise Expansion Film,” the sequel will be released in theaters in 2027. 


	Plot details are being kept under wraps. Josh Greenbaum will direct from a script by Benji Samit, Dan Hernandez, and Josh Gad, as announced in June of last year. Gad is also expected to star and will produce alongside Imagine Entertainment's Brian Grazer and Jeb Brody, Brooks, and Greenbaum, with Kevin Salter, Adam Merims, Samit, and Hernandez exec producing.

	Released by MGM in 1987, Spaceballs is an iconic send-up of the sci-fi genre, which took inspiration from the Star Wars franchise and other classics. The plot revolves around the evil Dark Helmet (Moranis) and President Skroob (Brooks), who attempt to steal the atmosphere of the peaceful planet Druidia, only to be thwarted by the hero Lone Starr (Pullman), his sidekick Barf (John Candy), and the Druish princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga). Others in the cast included Joan Rivers and Dick Van Patten. The film grossed just over $38.1 worldwide but has endured over the years as a cult classic.


	The comedic icon behind such additional classics as The Producers, Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, Brooks won an Oscar for his script to The Producers, receiving an additional Honorary Oscar in 2024. Over the years, he's also been recognized with a BAFTA fellowship, the AFI's Life Achievement Award, four Emmys, four Golden Globe nominations, three Grammys, multiple WGA Awards (including the Laurel Award for Screen Writing Achievement), and myriad other accolades. Most recently, he wrote on, exec produced and narrated Hulu's History of the World, Part II, a series sequel to his film History of the World, Part I from 1981. He also played himself in an episode of Only Murders in the Building and is repped by CAA and attorney Jay L. Cooper.

Amid the news that “Dancing With the Stars” professional dancer Sasha Farber has split from his girlfriend, “The Bachlorette” star Jenn Tran, it appears his fellow dancers are rallying around him to show their support. Daniella Karagach has discussed how she and husband Pasha Pashkov spend a lot of time with Farber, and that he has become a part of their relationship.

A post shared by Sasha Farber (@sashafarber1)

“He's our throuple,” Karagach told Us Weekly on June 11. “He's literally our third wheel. We take him everywhere. I'm not kidding.” She also shared that they spend so much time together that they feel like family, and commented on how amazing Farber is with their daughter, Nikita (she was born in May 2023).

“We love him. We get together all the time. We're either in his house or he's in our house,” Karagach said. “Kiki loves him. Sasha's like our kid. We adopted Sasha, even though he's older than us. We've adopted Sasha now.”

A post shared by Sasha Farber (@sashafarber1)

If Farber has found himself newly single, at least he has plenty of support. But what happened between him and Tran? The pair first met when they competed together on DWTS Season 33. Their chemistry was obvious and fans immediately speculated about whether their onscreen connection had become something more.

The pair never confirmed they were a couple, but People reports that a source said they have split after almost a year of dating but remain “very good friends.”

Farber and Tran have both been active on social media since the news of their split was announced. Both have shared videos that have nothing to do with their relationship, but in the comment section of Tran's cooking video, which she posted on Instagram on June 10, some fans have expressed their sadness. “I'm so sad in what I read on TMZ,” a comment reads. “But I hope you guys remain friends and you each find someone to love we wish you both the best.” Another fan also weighed in, writing, “Miss your Sasha and Jenn content.”

“Not related to this buuut…. Are you and sash still together!?” a fan asked.

If the couple were dating, and again, fans are convinced they were, then what is the reason for their split? People reports that the split was amicable and Us Weekly reports that a source told them “they're no longer seeing each other.” The source adds that Tran is “focusing hard on her studies and not letting anything else get in the way of her goals right now,” Us Weekly reports.

“I feel afraid inside there. I can't be inside there," the jury foreperson said Wednesday. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


Harvey Weinstein's rape charge ended in mistrial after the jury foreperson refused to return to the jury room Thursday saying he faced threats from other jurors. 


	The 12-person jury in Weinstein's trial had found him guilty Wednesday of one count of a criminal sexual act against former Project Runway assistant Miriam Haley, but not guilty of the other count of a criminal sexual act against former model Kaja Sokola. Those convictions stand. 




	After the mistrial was declared, prosecutors said Thursday that they plan to retry Weinstein on the rape charge, related to aspiring actress Jessica Mann, and that “she is ready and willing and wants to retry this count.” A July 2 hearing has been set on that charge.

					Harvey Weinstein Receives Mixed Partial Verdict as Deliberations Heat Up in Criminal Case		
			









	Weinstein faced one charge of rape in the third degree and two charges of criminal sexual act in the first degree, which is the higher felony charge and carries a maximum prison sentence of 25 years. The rape charge carries a sentence of up to four years. Weinstein's attorneys said they will appeal the criminal sexual act conviction and conduct further investigation into possible juror misconduct. 


	On Wednesday, the jury had yet to reach a verdict on rape in the third degree, but jurors were sent home midday amid concerns about fighting and tensions in the jury room. They had been in the midst of their fifth day of deliberations.


	The jury foreperson had sent a note Wednesday afternoon asking to speak to the judge and then told the attorneys and Judge Curtis Farber: “I feel afraid inside there. I can't be inside there.” 

	











	He added that other jurors had been trying to get him to change his decision, and, when he had refused, had said “Oh we will see you outside,” and that he was concerned for his own safety. 


	When the foreperson was asked Thursday if he would return to the jury room, he told the court, “No, I'm sorry.”


	However, Farber spoke with the others jurors after the mistrial was declared Thursday and said “they were extremely disappointed” that deliberations had not continued and that “they don't understand why the foreperson bowed out.”


	Jury tensions had reached such a fever pitch Wednesday that Weinstein himself addressed the court, urging the judge for a mistrial. His request was denied at the time. 


	“This is not right for me, the person who is on trial here,” Weinstein said Wednesday. “This is my life that's on the line, and you know what? It's not fair. It's simple. It's just not fair.”


	The foreperson, who is charged with speaking on behalf of the jury, then returned to court after the jury had been dismissed Wednesday and implied that he did not want to go back into the deliberation room Thursday. He returned to court, but was being kept separately from the other jurors Thursday morning. 


	On Monday morning, the foreperson had also asked to speak to the judge and said that jurors were considering elements from Weinstein's past that weren't being used as evidence in the trial and weren't part of the charged crimes. 

	











	Another juror, who was juror No. 7 on this case and the youngest on the jury, had asked to address the court twice Friday, first saying he had heard jurors discussing another juror in the courtroom elevators, and then asking to be excused from the jury as he did not feel the process was “fair,” while staring at the defense table. 


	“If you're a deliberating juror you have to be punched in the face in order for it to rise to the level of a real threat,” Weinstein's attorney, Arthur Aidala said Thursday, while urging the judge to call for mistrial before the juror entered. “It's insane in the membrane, insane on the brain.” 


	All of this comes after Weinstein's 2020 rape and criminal sexual assault conviction was overturned in April 2024 after the court of appeals found the trial prejudiced Weinstein with improper rulings, including allowing women to testify about allegations that were not part of the case.


	In the 2020 trial, Weinstein received a mixed verdict with the jury finding Weinstein guilty of the crimes against Haley and Mann, but also acquitting Weinstein of first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault related to other women. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg pursued the retrial of Weinstein shortly after his conviction was overturned.


	Weinstein has already served six years of that sentence, which Aidala said would count toward times served in sentencing for this case. 


	In this trial, Mann had testified that she had first met Weinstein around 2013 at a party in Hollywood. After later attending his Oscars party, Mann said she was invited by Weinstein up to his hotel room, where he said he wanted to give Mann and her friend a script for Vampire Academy. There, Weinstein performed unwanted oral sex on her. After that incident, Mann said she decided to embark on a relationship with him. 

	











	”I just thought it would take the pain away,” Mann said on the stand.


	The charge relates to an alleged incident with Weinstein in a Manhattan hotel in March 2013. At the time, Mann was visiting New York City with friends and said she had arranged to meet Weinstein for breakfast, along with her friends, but found that he had arrived early at her hotel and was in the process of booking a hotel room. 


	Despite her protests, Weinstein booked the room and she followed him upstairs. Once there, she claims he repeatedly held the door shut as she tried to leave and said she didn't want to do this, while he grabbed her arms and told her to undress. 


	She did so, and said Weinstein then went to the bathroom and injected himself with a substance which she later found was to treat erectile dysfunction, and then performed unwanted penetrative sex on her.

The "Espresso" singer did, however, share the important lesson that era taught her.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	For a lot of people — Sabrina Carpenter included — the online drama surrounding her supposed part in Olivia Rodrigo‘s “Drivers License” love triangle drama feels like a lifetime ago. 


	But in 2021, the debacle was pretty much all anyone could talk about, with the internet casting the “Espresso” singer in the “other woman” archetype after actor Joshua Bassett reportedly broke up with his High School Musical: The Musical: The Series castmate to start dating Carpenter. It all stemmed from lyrics on Rodrigo's Billboard Hot 100-topping debut single, on which she sings, “You're probably with that blonde girl, who always made me doubt.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Years later, the Girl Meets World alum is far better known for her own chart-toppers such as “Please Please Please” following the success of her breakthrough 2024 album Short n' Sweet, and Carpenter and Rodrigo have even been spotted looking friendly at events in the years since the drama unfolded. But in her Rolling Stone cover story published Thursday (June 12), the two-time Grammy winner shared what being the target of so many rumors taught her.


	“All I knew was that it wasn't going to stop me from doing what I loved, ever,” she told the publication. “That's kind of how I've always felt. Sometimes, it's about how you are able to be resilient. What that era taught me was to just trust myself, and trust that everything is going to work out the way it's supposed to, and trust that relationships are put into your life for a reason. You might not see that in the moment, but you see it later.” 

	











	Noting that she “didn't really intentionally” try to change public opinion of her post-“Drivers License,” Carpenter revealed whether or not she ever ruminates on that time period. “I don't think about it, ever,” she deadpanned.


	The “Taste” artist, who earlier in the story revealed that she sometimes wears a brown wig to disguise herself in public, jokingly added, “I've tried being ­brunette, and it didn't look good on me, so this is what it is.”


	It's not the first time Carpenter has addressed what happened in 2021. She dropped the singles “Skin” and “Because I Liked a Boy” as presumed responses to feeling misunderstood by the public amid the criticism. She also told Billboard in October of that year, “It's such a waste of time, because you'll never know the truth.”


	“That's part of the fun of it, I guess,” she added at the time. “But at the same time, there are real people. I will say, that's the hardest thing — trying to be truthful to yourself, make art that feels real and exciting, but then also knowing that [you're writing] about humans going through what we're all going through on a daily basis.”


	The Rolling Stone interview comes just one day after Carpenter announced her new album, Man's Best Friend, which follows the release of lead single “Manchild” earlier this month. The LP will drop Aug. 29, almost exactly one year after she released Short n' Sweet.


	It's an unusually short break between albums nowadays, but as Carpenter pointed out in the cover story, her idols — from Dolly Parton to Linda Rondstadt — used to do the same thing back in the day. “They would release a 10-song album every year,” she said. “I'm like, ‘When did we stop doing that?' Writers write, they make music, and they release music.”

	











	“If I really wanted to, I could have stretched out Short n' Sweet much, much longer,” Carpenter added. “But I'm at that point in my life where I'm like, ‘Wait a second, there's no rules.' If I'm inspired to write and make something new, I would rather do that. Why would I wait three years just for the sake of waiting three years? It's all about what feels right. I'm learning to listen to that a lot more, instead of what is perceived as the right or wrong move.”

Sting honored his hero Brian Wilson hours after news of his death during a concert in Germany Wednesday evening. While on stage, Sting played a guitar-backed rendition of the Beach Boys‘ “God Only Knows.”


	“Today, one of my heroes died, Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys,” Sting said before his performance. “So I want to sing a song that I love.” Sting shared a video of the moment on his Instagram, writing, “Rest in peace, Brian Wilson,” in the caption.

	The musician now joins Elton John, Carole King, Mick Fleetwood, and countless other musicians who have shared tributes for the late Beach Boy. “Brian had that mysterious sense of musical genius that made his songs so achingly special,” Paul McCartney wrote on social media following Wilson's death. “The notes he heard in his head and passed to us were simple and brilliant at the same time. I loved him, and was privileged to be around his bright shining light for a little while.”

	On Aug. 29, Sabrina Carpenter will release her seventh studio album, Man's Best Friend. It arrives exactly 359 days after her last record, the massive Short n' Sweet.


	That's an unusual move these days, when stars typically wait longer between releases. Plus, Carpenter is still touring behind Short n' Sweet, hitting the festival circuit this summer before launching another North American leg in the fall. In her new Rolling Stone cover story, she explained why she's moving fast.


	“If I really wanted to, I could have stretched out Short n' Sweet much, much longer,” she told RS. “But I'm at that point in my life where I'm like, ‘Wait a second, there's no rules.' If I'm inspired to write and make something new, I would rather do that. Why would I wait three years just for the sake of waiting three years? It's all about what feels right. I'm learning to listen to that a lot more, instead of what is perceived as the right or wrong move.”

	Carpenter also said that her decision was influenced by her favorite artists from past decades, like ABBA, Dolly Parton, and Linda Ronstadt. “They would release a 10-song album every year,” she said. “I'm like, ‘When did we stop doing that?' Writers write, they make music, and they release music. I understand the beauty of disappearing. My last two albums both took two and a half years to make, and they needed to. I just think every project is different. It just has to feel right.”

	Her producer, Jack Antonoff, agrees: “I think, as a culture, we got a little obsessed with marketing,” he added in the RS story. “The lesson to me, which we talked about when we're making this, is that listening to anything besides the music as a guide is ridiculous.”

	











	Elsewhere in the story, Carpenter discussed her new single “Manchild,” how she maintains a healthy lifestyle on the road (cold-plunging and rarely drinking alcohol), and how she uses humor as a device. She also addresses the internet's obsession with her love life and the more sexual parts of her show, and how it feels to live in a time in which “women have been picked apart more, and scrutinized in every capacity.”

“Long Story Short” cuts to the point. Coming from “BoJack Horseman” creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, it's without the parody dressing “BoJack Horseman” presents, instead getting closer to the heart of human conflict and comedy. 

Screening at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival this week, the first episode of the “BoJack” creator's latest animated Netflix series sees Avi (Ben Feldman) bring his new girlfriend Jennifer (Abbi Jacobson) to meet his family ahead of his little brother Yoshi's (Max Greenfield) Bat Mitzvah. It drowns you in overlapping dialogue, religious anxiety, and eccentric family members, immediately distancing itself from Waksberg's past work. The series then follows the Jewish family through the years, their hopes, and disappointments.

“I was thinking about family, time, and identity,” Waksberg told IndieWire at Annecy. “In the writers room, I wrote those up on a board, like this is what the show is about. More specifically, I was thinking about how our relationships with our family change over time, and how our identity changes over time, and the ways we see ourselves and think about ourselves, and how so much of that is defined by our family. When we have kids, oftentimes we are trying to either emulate or correct the ways that we were brought up. In some ways, we succeed, and in some ways, we fail. In some ways, we repeat what our parents did, and in some ways, we overreact to what our parents did. To think about that cause and effect on a longitudinal scale was really interesting.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






As much as the themes resonate with him personally, Waksberg hesitates to label “Long Story Short” as autobiographical. “I would say it feels more personal than autobiographical, because you don't know my biography. But I wanted it to feel real and lived in. It's not really about my family, but it is about family, and it's about my thoughts on family, the rhythms of family and the way family interacts. I'd say all my work is personal in that way. I'm of the belief that on some level, all art is autobiographical, sometimes in ways you don't even realize.”

Authentically depicting family made Waksberg write in a different register than what “BoJack” offered audiences. “We definitely do more dual dialogue than we ever did on ‘BoJack.' That was very intentional. I wanted to have multiple conversations happening at the same time, and an awareness that the audience is not going to hear everything, and that's okay, that's a little leap of faith that people aren't going to feel like, ‘Wait, what's going on?' Part of making a show is teaching your audience how to watch it. We want to be intentional in signaling to the audience that, if you missed something, don't worry, you're not supposed to get everything, maybe watch it a second time and pick out what other people are saying. We wrote and edited the dialogue, trying to move the conversations faster.”

 










He added, “This part is actually very autobiographical. It's based on my family and probably other families as well. You don't wait till the end of the sentence to start talking, especially when you know what the other person is saying, you're gonna start before they're done. If you're not raised in that mode, it can be very overwhelming and off-putting, but I'm interrupting you because I'm showing that we're in this together. So I think trying to write in that mode was very intentional.”

“Long Story Short” also feels so personal because of its exploration of Jewish identity, depicting Yoshi as having a crisis of faith. “Being Jewish means so many different things to different people,” said Waksberg. “A lot of stories about religion are centered around faith, because that is the Christian narrative, and faith is such an important part of Christianity and Judaism as I've experienced it. I'm not speaking for all Jews, but it's not as based in faith. That's not all what being Jewish means. I'm interested in religion as far as culture and community and history and identity.”

Returning from working on “BoJack” with Waksberg, as well as Netflix's “Tuca & Bertie,” is character designer Lisa Hanawalt, whose work is more restrained, more minimal, than what she showcased on her previous series. “It was very intentional,” added Waksberg. “We wanted it to not look like ‘BoJack' or ‘Tuca.' We didn't want it to be mistaken as a spinoff and feel like BoJack can walk in any minute. That was the main guidance I gave her. Working with Lisa as long as I have, there's trust there, there's faith there, and I often feel the less direction I give her, the more I get to be surprised and delighted. I was really interested in her idea of having dots for eyes, instead of full eyes. We did a lot of tests to see how expressive they could be, and you look at old ‘Peanuts' comics. Those characters are very expressive. It was really fun to think about new ways of using eyes on this show.”

 










When he spoke to IndieWire last year, Waksberg discussed how “BoJack Horseman” had to be tailored around how audiences watch shows on streaming: linearly and often all at once. In the 11 years since, the landscape has changed yet again, which led him to think differently about the structure of “Long Story Short.” 

“I was interested in thinking about how audiences watch shows. One thing I have felt is that ‘BoJack' has done very well, even for people who weren't watching when it was on. One of the reasons for that is because it's long-running, there are 77 episodes of it, and when you get to the end, you're ready to start it all over again.”

Waksberg said, “That's harder to do with fewer seasons with shorter episode orders, which you see a lot of in streaming. On a show like this, the goal is to make you fall in love with the characters. Can you shortcut that a little bit by jumping around time and watching these characters grow up? Can you feel, by the end of the first season, that you've watched five seasons of this show? Can you feel that same kind of warmth that you feel with something you've seen 100 episodes of? That's the great experiment. Given the landscape of television right now, I'm probably not going to get 100 episodes. Is there a way to get some of that same effect?”

 










At the end of the credits, “Long Story Short” makes a point to stress that “This Programme Was Made By Humans.” “It's a bit of a toothless guarantee, because there's no standard at this point, there's no Humane Society of Anti-AI to certify this as the correct amount of non-automation,” said Waksberg. “But as a statement of value, it was worth saying out loud, ‘This is important to us,' and what I love about the show is that it is made by humans. Even in the artwork, we were really deliberate in saying, ‘Let's color outside the lines a little bit, let's, let's make this feel handmade.' In the writing, too, we want it to feel personal. We want it to feel specific.”

He added, “One of the things I love about getting to do this work is how collaborative it is. I get to work with these other humans who come in with their own stuff. I could see a world in which I had an idea for a show, and I could write up a paragraph about it, and then a machine could kind of spit it out exactly the way I was imagining it should. I don't think we're there yet, but I could see that scenario. But I don't want a show exactly the way I'm imagining it. I get to be surprised by the brilliance and the experience of these other people that have worked on it. And I do feel like we need to draw some lines in the sand. We all do, every single day. I don't know what that line is, but I think it is worth talking about, as audiences [are] saying we don't want AI art.”

 










“Long Story Short” premieres on Netflix August 22.

The Recording Academy has unveiled its updated rulebook for the 2026 Grammy Awards. Key changes include the division of the Best Country Album category into two awards: The original category is now called Best Contemporary Country Album, and a new one, Best Traditional Country Album, has been added. Notably, Beyoncé won the 2025 Best Country Album Grammy in her first year of nomination in the category; her Lemonade song “Daddy Lessons” was controversially rejected by the country music committee in 2016.

A shakeup in the packaging field has led to the creation of a new category, Best Album Cover, as well as the merging of the Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package category—in which Jeff Mangum was a surprise 2024 nominee—with Best Recording Package. Albums sold directly to fans will also qualify for packaging Grammys from now on.

Elsewhere, Best New Artist eligibility has expanded. In the past, contributors to records nominated for Album of the Year would be ineligible for Best New Artist in the future. That remains the case, with some exceptions. In 2023, the Recording Academy tightened its Album of the Year eligibility criteria to exclude contributors who feature on less than 20 percent of the album. If your prior Album of the Year nomination would not have been eligible under the new, tighter parameters, you are now, once again, eligible for Best New Artist.

The overall changes, said Harvey Mason Jr., in a press release, are the result of “listening carefully to [Recording Academy] members to make sure our rules and guidelines reflect today's music.” The next Grammy Awards take place on Sunday, February 1, 2026. Nominees are announced on Friday, November 7, 2025.

“The Batman” won't be back in Gotham anytime soon. Three years after a sequel was announced in 2022, DC head James Gunn has shared that a script is still not yet complete. Matt Reeves is writing the sequel and is set to direct, with Robert Pattinson reprising the title role.

Gunn told Entertainment Weekly that Reeves is still at work on the script, and “The Batman 2” remains a “really important” installment in the burgeoning DC universe. Gunn's “Superman” is also rumored to have a reference to the Caped Crusader. 

“What Matt's doing is still really important, despite all stories to the contrary,” Gunn said. “We're supposed to see that script [for ‘The Batman 2'] shortly, and I can't wait.”

Warner Bros. previously delayed “The Batman 2” release from October 2, 2026 to October 1, 2027. Another delay might happen if the script has not yet been finalized as of June 2025.

Gunn said in 2024 that the delay between the two “Batman” films was to be expected. “To be fair, a 5 year gap or more is fairly common in sequels,” Gunn wrote on Threads at the time. “7 years between ‘Alien' and ‘Aliens.' 14 years between ‘Incredibles.' 7 years between the first two ‘Terminators.' 13 years between ‘Avatars.' 36 years between ‘Top Guns.' And, of course, 6 years between ‘Guardians Vol 2' and ‘Vol 3.'”He also earlier posted on Threads to confirm the delay of “The Batman 2,” writing that “the only reason the film was pushed” was because a “full script” wasn't done yet. “Matt [Reeves] is committed to making the best film he possibly can, and no one can accurately guess exactly how long a script will take to write,” Gunn wrote. “Once there is a finished script, there is around two years for pre-production, shooting and post-production on big films.”

 










Reeves previously described “The Batman” as only the beginning to a multi-layered franchise, telling Entertainment Weekly in 2022 that he wants to “create a Batverse” surrounding Pattinson's Dark Knight. “You don't do a story and go, ‘This is Chapter 1' because you might not get to do Chapter 2. So, the story had to stand on its own,” Reeves said of the film. “But the thing about it is that the Bat world is so rich with character that as you're starting to come to an end, you can already start thinking about the next thing. Because the idea, of course, is that Gotham's story never ends.”

After playing more than 100 festivals starting at Cannes, Mahdi Fleifel's acclaimed refugee drama “To a Land Unknown” from Palestine is finally coming to theaters from Watermelon Pictures. IndieWire exclusively debuts the trailer for “To a Land Unknown” below.

The film follows Chatila (Mahmood Bakri) and Reda (Aram Sabbah), cousins and refugees stranded in Athens and trying to reach Germany. To escape Greece, they hatch a plan to pose as smugglers taking hostages, with dire consequences for their friendship. “It's especially moving to me, in these incredible times, to present a Palestinian film at Cannes. As Palestinians, we challenge media stereotypes, but more importantly, we defy invisibility, a struggle we've faced since the beginning. Our stories are needed now more than ever,” Fleifel, born in Dubai from Palestinian parents but raised in Denmark, said announcing the movie. This is Fleifel's first narrative feature after the acclaimed documentary “A World Not Ours” premiered at TIFF more than a decade ago.

More on the film from the official synopsis: “The film tells the story of Chatila and Reda, two Palestinian cousins and best friends who are saving to pay for fake passports to get out of of Athens. When Reda loses their hard-earned cash to his drug addiction, Chatila hatches an extreme plan, which involves them posing as smugglers and taking hostages in an effort to get him and his best friend out of their hopeless environment before it is too late.”

IndieWire praised “To a Land Unknown” in an A- review out of the 2024 Directors' Fortnight at Cannes, with Sophie Monks Kaufman writing, “‘To a Land Unknown' is a tour-de-force of empathic storytelling, with its genre narrative bursting with an overabundance of humanity. The unexpected, far-away place that Said references is expressed fully, as both a geographical reality and a soul in exile.”

“To a Land Unknown” opens in theaters on Friday, July 11. Check out the film's first trailer, an IndieWire exclusive, below.

Warner Bros. Animation and DC Studios are taking the next step on their animated journey with a TV version of the Mister Miracle comic book series. 


Tom King, who wrote the Mister Miracle comics with Mitch Gerads, is showrunning and EPing this one, which is in production although network remains TBD. The show comes after James Gunn's Creature Commandos, which is currently in production on its second season for HBO Max. No details were given on voice cast.


Mister Miracle, which Warner said will tell the “odyssey” of main character Scott Free aka Mister Miracle, is based on the critically acclaimed and Eisner Award-winning 12-issue comic book series.

	“No prison can hold him,” says the logline. “No trap can contain him. He is Scott Free, the worldwide celebrity sensation known as Mister Miracle, and he is the greatest escape artist who ever lived. But can he pull off the ultimate trick – and escape death itself?” 


	Logline goes on to say the show begins with “something gone horribly wrong with the perfect life that Scott and his warrior wife Big Barda have built for themselves on Earth.”


	King is currently also in production on HBO's Lanterns TV series. 


	The news was unveiled at Annecy, where animated versions of major IP has been big business. Yesterday, a packed crowd was shown early designs and footage of Stranger Things: Tales From '85, the first animated series in the franchise. Later, the BBC unveiled an animated version of Doctor Who for pre-school kids.

Filmmaker Colin Trevorrow is not prone to quoting his own movies in conversation, but when he sat down with IndieWire for late morning coffee earlier this week in New York City, one of his own lines seemed pretty apt to the interview at hand.

“There's a line in the third ‘Jurassic' movie, this little speech that Jeff Goldblum gives where he's like, ‘They give you a lot of promotions very quickly and they don't think that you're going to look around and notice that they're exploiting your fascination with these,' and he holds up a little dinosaur,” Trevorrow said. “That whole thing was about this idea that our love for the things that we grew up on — cinema in general and specifically those franchises — run so deep that, in some ways, I don't want to say you could be taken advantage of, because I appreciate [my opportunities] deeply, but you'll put yourself in a situation that you would never otherwise put yourself in because you love that thing so much. You'll make yourself vulnerable to failure, because you love that thing so much.”

Trevorrow is speaking from plenty of experience. The filmmaker first rose to acclaim with the 2012 sci-fi dramedy “Safety Not Guaranteed,” which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Waldo Scott Screenwriting Award. At the fest, FilmDistrict picked up the film for an estimated seven-figure deal (the film was made for under $1 million) and released it later that summer, making over $4.4 million in box office returns.

 










As the story goes, the success of that film propelled Trevorrow and writing partner Derek Connolly into Hollywood, and their follow-up to the festival gem was a giant one: 2015's “Jurassic World,” which Trevorrow directed and the pair wrote together. In the years since his studio debut, Trevorrow has experienced major highs (like the “Jurassic World” franchise, including two films that Trevorrow directed, all three of which he co-wrote, making nearly $4 billion at the box office) and horrible lows (probably most of 2017, which saw the release of his critically maligned “The Book of Henry” and leaving the ninth “Star Wars” film, which he was set to direct and co-write).

Instead of tapping out of the film business, Trevorrow doubled down: founding his own production shingle, Metronome Film Co., in 2019 with the express intent to “champion bold storytelling.” Mostly, Trevorrow is a filmmaker who knows just how heartbreaking the business can be, especially for younger filmmakers, and he's hoping Metronome might help change that. 

Six years later, “Deep Cover,” the first film to be made under the Metronome banner is finally here. The comedy comes from an older script from Trevorrow and Connolly about a trio of mismatched London improv actors who get conscripted into helping the police infiltrate the city's criminal underworld. The pair reworked their original screenplay alongside Ben Ashenden and Alexander Owen (known in comedy circles as The Pin), and it's directed by long-time TV helmer Tom Kingsley.

 










“It's very populist kind of comedy,” Trevorrow said. “It's definitely looking to make absolutely everybody laugh and it's ridiculous and it's kind of liberating to do that.”

The film also stars his “Jurassic World” star Bryce Dallas Howard, who he has remained close with over the years. “I wish she acted more, but I'm also in such support of her directing career, and our friendship is so based on being another director that I can talk to,” he said. “There's some conversations that only directors can have with each other.”

Trevorrow mentions a lot of other directors in conversation, his compatriots and inspirations, the kind of people he can only have certain kinds of conversations with. He's not only from the same generation of many of these fellow filmmakers, he's also taken a (somewhat) similar route to them. That old story: rising indie filmmakers who had one or two well-regarded indies before being snapped up by studios for big-budget work.

The list of names is long and familiar: Chloe Zhao, Ryan Coogler, Jon Watts, Marc Webb, and Trevorrow handily finished my train of thought and added in Gareth Edwards, Rian Johnson, James Gunn, Ava DuVernay, and Nia DaCosta. When I noted that I often worry that we missed out on an entire generation of second or third indie films from some of these directors, Trevorrow nodded.

 










“You sound like me,” he said. “I say this: I definitely agree with that.” And that's baked into the vision of Metronome.

“There's so much that's happened in [the last] 10 years when it comes to the kind of commodification of talent,” he said. “And we have seen, multiple times, filmmakers make one film that defined a voice and then a kind of larger, often corporate, I don't want to say machine, feeling like, ‘Well, we can take that voice and apply it to something that will make a lot of money all around.' And sometimes it didn't work and sometimes it did. The part of it that frustrates me the most is I don't necessarily believe that when it didn't work, it was the fault of the filmmaker, ultimately. I think that matching subject matter and material with filmmakers is a huge thing that I focus on as a producer: Who's the exact right person tell this specific story?”

Trevorrow is clear: he had great support when he entered the studio fray, but he's heard plenty of horror stories about people who didn't. “I was in a very fortunate situation where I had Frank Marshall and Steven Spielberg and Pat Crowley, who were right there, answering questions for me and guiding me and kind of knocking the ball back into play all the time,” he said. “I know a lot of filmmakers who didn't feel like there was really anyone to go to when they didn't know what the hell was going on. As a producer now, that's one of the things I'm really focused on, how can I provide that same thing to younger directors and make sure that they have the kind of support that I had and that I think others wish they had?”

 










As we talk more about the greater challenges and larger ramifications of being pulled into the studio space, Trevorrow mentions something both surprising and instructive: “I didn't make any money off ‘Jurassic World.'” (Excuse us?)

He paused and laughed, “I know, you're giving me that look. I didn't really make money until the sequels. That's kind of how it works. If you're looking for the equation that's leading to young indie filmmakers coming in and then staying in, it's because you have to stay in longer, stay in the casino and keep playing before you can walk out with your bucket of chips.”

Trevorrow's affection for filmmakers is also rooted in his instincts about them. No, not everyone can direct, and certainly not everyone can direct a big-budget studio film. “It is not everyone who can do it, but when I meet someone who can do, it's sort of instantly recognizable,” he said. One example to him right now: DaCosta. She's got it. That instinct about her, Trevorrow said, made him feel as if he understood Spielberg a bit more.

Trevorrow doesn't mind busting open all sorts of myths, especially ones about himself and his trajectory, like that Universal plucked him out of indie obscurity after “Safety Not Guaranteed” and just gave him “Jurassic World.” Spielberg had actually been in the Trevorrow business long before that, having bought Trevorrow's first script when he was 30.

 










“I had been hustling as a writer and written for every major studio by the time I did ‘Safety Not Guaranteed,' and so I was a bit of a known quantity when it came to constructing large-scale movies,” he said. “But it was a little bit more Dickensian to say, oh, Universal found him in a 7-Eleven or whatever, but that wasn't what it was. In some ways, it's not the right story to tell, because people shouldn't think that it's that easy because it isn't that easy. You do have to hustle for 10 years in order to even build your craft, let alone be seen as anyone who should be trusted with any kind of responsibility whatsoever.”

Another myth to bust: Trevorrow is not from Vermont. He grew up in Oakland, moved to Los Angeles, and decamped for Burlington after he sold that first screenplay to Spielberg. “I have made a lot of choices in the favor of when I go, my kids will remember me well,” he said. “I probably could have made more movies by now, but I would've definitely been gone more. But I can't regret that. It's not possible to regret making choices that have resulted in the two kids that I have and the relationship I had with my wife.”

He added with a laugh, “I do think that added to the narrative [about my rise]. I think people thought I was from Vermont, and we literally moved to Vermont because I was in the dentist's office and I saw ‘Best Place to Live in America' on the cover of a magazine.”

 










The thinking behind Metronome was a touch more considered. “It started with Annys Hamilton, who started as an assistant on the second ‘Jurassic' movie,” Trevorrow said of his fellow Metronome producer. Because of his quick rise in the production world, there was one thing that Trevorrow didn't have: his producer. “I felt like, well, why don't over time, in order to have that level of understanding of who I am and what my mission is, we'll just kind of build it ourselves,” he said.

When Metronome was first founded in 2019, it was just in time to ride out the pandemic and two Hollywood strikes. “I wouldn't mind a little stability, a little consistency sounds great for me,” Trevorrow said with a laugh.

The Metronome office is just four people — including Hamilton, fellow producer Rebecca Linfoot, and associate Zach Abbs — which seems like a smart way to keep focus tight (and, let's be honest, costs low). “The goal was, let's find a way to delve into producing and actually produce, not just be a director's vanity shingle, but really actually get on the ground and do the job, ideally in the indie space,” Trevorrow said.

“Deep Cover” was entirely independently financed, made for the low (very low) eight figures, some from the bank, some from Trevorrow himself, with Amazon coming in for a negative pickup deal. The film premiered at SXSW London, screened at Tribeca this week, and will be available on Prime Video this Friday.

 










“We were on the streets of East London with cameras running around, and it was thrilling for me,” he said. “I loved being able to provide those guys with a kind of opportunity to do what I got to do on ‘Safety,' which is to show what they are capable of. … [They have] new original voices that have to find a way. If indie film is largely impossible, how are they going to make their ‘Safety Not Guaranteed'? Who's going to do that? I feel like we do have a bit of a responsibility, as filmmakers who have secured the bag. Maybe you make less money in your lifetime, but if when you're done, you can look back and you can point to a couple of filmmakers who they got their opportunity because I made a little less money.”

They've got lots in the works now, including a new film to be directed by Bryce Dallas Howard (and written by Trevorrow and Sarah Streicher), plus Caleb Hearon's “Trash Mountain,” which the viral internet star wrote with Ruby Caster, and will star in. That film was originally set to be directed by Lilly Wachowski, but the director's dance card filled up, so she's moved into an EP role.

She did, however, point the team to the film's new director: Kris Rey, who previously directed “I Used to Go Here” and “Unexpected,” and worked with Wachowski on the series “Work in Progress.”

 










“Raising money for that movie has been extraordinarily difficult. A small indie queer movie in 2025, which doesn't necessarily have an international presence?,” he said. “Yet I'm so deeply determined to make this movie. In lot of ways, the energy from that is more satisfying for me than it would be to go jump on another franchise or anything like that. It's just what keeps me excited about movies.”

Speaking of other franchises… When I mentioned to Trevorrow that, to this day, when you Google his name, the first thing that auto-populates is “Colin Trevorrow Star Wars Script,” he laughed. “I've not Googled my name in seven years,” he said. 

In 2015, Trevorrow was announced as the director of what would become the ninth installment in the main “Star Wars” franchise. He and Connolly wrote a script, too, entitled “Duel of the Fates.” When they left in 2017 (about seven years ago!), “The Force Awakens” director J.J. Abrams returned to direct the film, complete with a new script from Abrams and Chris Terrio that became “The Rise of Skywalker.” In 2020, when Abrams' film had only been in theaters for a few weeks, Trevorrow and Connolly's script leaked online. Some fans loved it, some didn't (so, a “Star Wars” script then?).

 










Trevorrow didn't talk about that experience for a long time, and when he did, he was honest: it was sad. Nearly a decade on, he has a little more distance from it. “I got to sit across from George Lucas for hours and hours and talk about ‘Star Wars,'” he said. “I got to build this whole, really comprehensive [idea of] what a movie it could have been. It was just this extraordinary two years of my life. Of course, I had tremendous, deep, profound sadness and even depression that lasted for years over the loss of that. That said, if I had my ‘It's a Wonderful Life' moment, I couldn't say no, I wish it had never happened, because I wouldn't have gotten to do it. It's a tough one.”

No matter what happened with “Star Wars,” it did at least reinforce one thing for Trevorrow: he loves making movies. “I've always loved the process, I've never had a bad experience making a movie,” he said. “I've had bad experiences releasing movies and that's usually the part I dread a little bit.”

Yes, he's talking about “The Book of Henry.” And no matter how much guff he got for the film — enough to kick any desire to self-Google clear out of him! — Trevorrow can't regret that one either. While he said he still feels a “real, genuine, true sadness when it comes to ‘Book of Henry' and when it comes to the ways that my intentions have been received in certain scenarios,” he's pragmatic about it now. “You sign up for it. You really do,” Trevorrow said. “You just know that, if you're going to be a storyteller, you have to accept that you're forging a relationship with the audience and it's your job to sure that that relationship reflects your soul. The hardest part is when I do something that does reflect my soul and it doesn't go down well, wait, do you not like my soul?”

 










That's true even when it comes to his “Jurassic World” films, including “Dominion,” which earned the worst reviews of the trilogy, and made the least amount at the box office, despite bringing back original stars and marketing promising it would end the franchise in style.

“‘Jurassic World: Dominion' was absolutely what I was thinking about at that moment, the dangers of genetic power in our world, so I made a science thriller,” Trevorrow said. “And the answer I got back was, ‘That plot needs to be about dinosaurs,' and I'm like, ‘OK, fair.' … All three of those ‘Jurassic' movies, they were about what I was thinking about at the time. ‘Jurassic World' is about how corporations are going to eat our childhood dreams. ‘Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' is about how animal trafficking is not a good idea, it could lead to horrible disaster, and is also deeply cruel. Then the third movie is obviously what it is. I do think, in time, as we look back on all of those movies, it will lead to a longevity and a rewatch value, because I don't think that they're fluff.”

He added with a smile, “Probably still could have been more chomps, I guess.”

He's not yet seen Gareth Edwards' “Jurassic World: Rebirth,” but he's very excited to partake, and as a fan, not even a filmmaker. “He asked me if I wanted to see it, but I just don't think you want to see a ‘Jurassic' movie alone in a screening room,” he said. “I want to go with my kids and my family. We're going to go to the big IMAX theater and check it out.”

 










Next up the Metronome docket: a Trevorrow-directed film, the one he “very well maybe doing next,” a recently announced untitled conspiracy thriller that Paramount will produce. While news of that film hit the trades just last month, Trevorrow said things are bit further along than news stories might have indicated.

“In the late 1980s, there was a Las Vegas TV news journalist named George Knapp, who reported on a whistleblower who came out of the desert saying that he's laid hands on [UFO] craft and it takes it from there,” he said. “It's very much in the vein of ‘Zodiac' or ‘All the President's Men.' I love movies that are building up to a moment when they're going to publish the story. It's my favorite kind of structure, and this is one of those kind of movies.”

And there's one more Metronome film in the ether that Trevorrow is also on deck to make: his long-gestating take on the myth of Atlantis. When I asked, “What's the movie you've always wanted to make?,” it was this one.

“I really love ‘Atlantis,' that's the one I've always wanted to make,” he said. “Atlantis, not like an underwater thing, but the story of our first civilization that had a lot of the kinds of technology we have now, that had a true government and its own sets of morals. It fell into the sea and then we had to start all over again. That movie is essentially a bunch of young people trying to tell the people in charge, ‘You're focused on the war, but actually what's going to happen is that comet's going to hit the earth and we're all going to perish, pay attention to this.' I feel like great sci-fi, great fantasy, it always snaps into what young people are feeling at a given moment.”

 










That film would also give Trevorrow the chance to tap into “the most rarefied air in storytelling”: to build an entirely new myth.” He's not holding his breath just yet, though. “Will I ever get to it? I don't know. Movies that cost a certain amount of money that are technically original are really hard these days,” he said. “So what I'll have to do is make a couple movies that actually really work and then maybe that'll be my reward. I know what I'm working for.”

How nice, I said, that you still consider making a movie its own reward. “To be able to make a story that you want to tell? Absolutely,” he said. “For some reason, I'm not burnt out on it and I don't entirely know why, because I should be.”

That's what he's putting into Metronome and this next step in his career. As we circled back on the idea of “losing” filmmakers to their studio work, Trevorrow looked back on his own filmography.

“I feel like, hopefully, when you watch my ‘Jurassic' movies, you'll see that I was telling my stories that I care about, for better or for worse,” he said. “To me, there are certain filmmakers, we never really lost them, whether they're doing something really big or small or somewhere in the middle. All we should ask of any filmmaker coming up is, don't lose yourself, try to put a piece of your soul in everything. Because, in the end, when we look at your body of work, we're going to know why you were here.”

 










“Deep Cover” screened at the SXSW London Festival and the Tribeca Festival. It will start streaming on Prime Video on Friday, June 13.

Bruce Springsteen has shared the rarity “Sunday Love,” the first song from his Western Stars–era lost album Twilight Hours. That record is one of seven compiled on Tracks II: The Lost Albums, his new box set, which is out June 27. Listen to “Sunday Love” below.

Twilight Hours is an orchestral album of “romantic, lost-in-the-city songs” inspired by the American pop standards, said Springsteen in press materials. “At one time it was either a double record [with Western Stars] or they were part of the same record,” he added. “I love Burt Bacharach and I love those kinds of songs and those kinds of songwriters. I took a swing at it because the chordal structures and everything are much more complicated, which was fun for me to pull off. All this stuff could have come right off of those '60s albums.” Players include the E Street Band's Max Weinberg, Patti Scialfa, and Soozie Tyrell, Kaveh Rastegar and Scott Tibbs, and producer Ron Aniello.

Springsteen has now released a song from all but one of the shelved albums compiled on Tracks II. The seven records span from 1983 to 2018, and include the mariachi-assisted Inyo, the country album Somewhere North of Nashville, the unreleased movie score Faithless, and the sample-based Streets of Philadelphia Sessions. The one album that Springsteen has not previewed is LA Garage Sessions '83.

Springsteen and the E Street Band are on the final leg of a tour that began in 2023. Read the column “Bruce Springsteen's Tour Is a Party Where the Ghosts of His Past Are on the Guest List.”

Paul McCartney has paid tribute to Brian Wilson following the death of the Beach Boys' “musical genius.”


	“Brian had that mysterious sense of musical genius that made his songs so achingly special,” McCartney wrote on social media Thursday, the morning after Wilson's death was announced. 

A post shared by Paul McCartney (@paulmccartney)


	“The notes he heard in his head and passed to us were simple and brilliant at the same time. I loved him, and was privileged to be around his bright shining light for a little while.”


	The Beach Boys and the Beatles enjoyed a creative rivalry in the Sixties that pushed both bands musically, to the benefit of everyone: In response to the Beatles' Rubber Soul, Brian Wilson encouraged his band toward experimentation to create their classic Pet Sounds (Rolling Stone named it Number Two in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time) which in turn inspired the Beatles on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

	











	McCartney has long praised Wilson's incomparable musical abilities, and even delivered the induction speech when the Beach Boy was welcomed into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, where he declared Wilson was “one of the great American geniuses.” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The Beatle has also claimed that the Beach Boys' “God Only Knows” is his favorite song of all time, and fittingly ended his tribute by noting, “How we will continue without Brian Wilson, ‘God Only Knows.'”

	Following news of Wilson's death, his Beach Boys band mates and some of the countless artists he inspired have also paid tribute to the pop music architect and composer of teenage symphonies to God. Elton John called Wilson “the biggest influence on my songwriting ever; he was a musical genius and revolutionary. He changed the goalposts when it came to writing songs and shaped music forever. A true giant.”

	











	Artists like Carole King, Graham Nash, Mick Fleetwood, Nancy Sinatra, and more have shared their own tributes to Wilson.

"The atmosphere was uncomfortable and weird," said a journalist who was in the 'Would I Lie To You?' audience on Tuesday.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	Comedian and children's author David Walliams has drawn widespread condemnation, including from the BBC, for making two Nazi salutes during a recording of panel show Would I Lie To You? earlier this week.


The Times first reported that Walliams, also a former judge on Britain's Got Talent, made the gestures during a segment in which another panellist joked about injuring their wrist while waving.




	The audience at Pinewood Studios, where the show's Christmas special was being filmed on Tuesday, was reportedly shocked when Walliams joined in to mimic the waves before holding his arm in a Nazi salute.

	A journalist called Sebastian Topan contacted the BBC to describe the incident. “Some other panellist was talking when David Walliams started doing the Nazi salute,” Topan told BBC News. “I was shocked at what I had seen… [There were] patches of quietened gasps and awkward half-laughs and broken clapping.”


Gavin & Stacey star Rob Brydon, hosting the show, informed Walliams the program would be broadcast before the 9 p.m. watershed. But as discussions continued, Walliams is said to have done the salute again and added a sexual gesture with his other hand. “The atmosphere was uncomfortable and weird,” Topan claimed.


The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Walliams' team for comment.


	A spokesperson for Banijay U.K., which owns the show's production company Zeppotron, said that any attempt at humor regarding this “deeply offensive gesture,” whether broadcast or not, is “completely unacceptable in any context.”


	“It was immediately acknowledged during the recording that this segment would not be broadcast under any circumstances,” they continued, “and we apologise to those who were at the recording for any offence caused.”


	A BBC spokesperson also said: “The use of such an offensive gesture is completely unacceptable and we apologise to all at the recording for the offence caused.”

	











	It isn't the first time Walliams has come under fire for controversy. Well known in the U.K. for his team-up on Little Britain and Come Fly With Me with Matt Lucas (Bridesmaids, Alice in Wonderland), he departed ITV's Britain's Got Talent in 2022 when a recording of him insulting contestants on the show were made public.

The Beatle had cited Wilson's work on Pet Sounds as a key inspiration for his future writing and recording.

Paul McCartney has paid tribute to the late Brian Wilson, 82, whose death was announced on Wednesday (June 11), calling his songs “achingly special” and that “I loved him.”


	Yesterday, news broke that the Beach Boys leader had died, but a cause and date of death has not yet been announced. A post on Wilson's official Instagram account wrote, “We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world.” 

	











	Tributes have been shared by a number of musical greats who were inspired by Wilson's songwriting genius, including Bob Dylan, Elton John, Questlove and more.

	On his Instagram account on Thursday (June 12), McCartney wrote, “Brian had that mysterious sense of musical genius that made his songs so achingly special. The notes he heard in his head and passed to us were simple and brilliant at the same time.”

	











	He added, “I loved him, and was privileged to be around his bright shining light for a little while. How we will continue without Brian Wilson, ‘God Only Knows'. Thank you, Brian. – Paul.”


	Wilson's work on the seminal LP Pet Sounds (1966) was hugely influential on McCartney and The Beatles' subsequent studio albums, particularly Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). McCartney cited “God Only Knows” as one of “the best songs ever written” and in 2000, inducted Wilson into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.


	Speaking during the ceremony, McCartney declared his admiration for Wilson's work. “In the '60s, particularly, he wrote some music that when I played it, it made me cry and I don't quite know why. It wasn't necessarily the words or the music, it's just something so deep in it, that there's only certain pieces of music that can do this to me… I think it's a sign of great genius to be able to do that with a bunch of music and a bunch of notes. And this man, he deserves to be in the Hall of Fame, that's for sure.


	He added, “So thank you, sir, for making me cry. For having that thing you can do with your music – you just put those notes, those harmonies together, stick a couple of words over the top and you've got me, any day.”


	Following the release of Pet Sounds, Wilson was increasingly impacted by mental health struggles and he was eventually diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. In February 2024, it was announced that he was diagnosed with dementia. Wilson is survived by his daughters Carnie and Wendy from his 1964 marriage to Marilyn Rovell, as well as his five adopted children with his wife Melinda Ledbetter, who passed in early 2024.

Did Wayne deliver?

Billboard Unfiltered is back with a reimagined format and will remain a live show every Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. ET. 


	Staff writer Kyle Denis, senior director R&B/hip-hop Carl Lamarre and senior charts analyst Trevor Anderson returned with new moderator Delisa Shannon on Wednesday (June 11) as the trio debated the early returns of Lil Wayne's Tha Carter VI, and all three skewed to various degrees of a negative reception to Weezy's latest installment in his decorated series.


	Lamarre compared Wayne's career legacy to that of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant and said Weezy still remains in his top five of all-time. Although, CL believes that the disappointing album and his solo output over the last decade have watered down his discography.

	“I need to fire whoever was A&R and executive producing my brother Wayne's album because this is easily the worst [Carter] in the entire series,” he claimed. “[C6] was just a full trainwreck… When you take out the mixtapes and look at pure albums. From one, five and six on Tha Carter is mid — everything else is mid.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Denis bluntly said C6 is “not a good album at all” and “a—.” “He spent the last year begging for sympathy by him not getting the Super Bowl slot and he deserved that,” he said. “This was the time to drop a fire album, get one or two hits off of that, and make your actual case for a Super Bowl headlining show next year. That's completely shot now because it's a—… You did not rise to the occasion.”


	Anderson seemed to enjoy the album most among the Unfiltered crew, highlighting the first six tracks as standouts before being derailed. “I'm not gonna be that hard on it,” TA began. “Clearly, it's the weakest entry in the canon… It didn't stick the landing for me… I don't know if this album really messes up [if Wayne is top five or top 10] for me… It does weaken Tha Carter series overall… But I don't think it messes up the legacy peg at all.”

	











	The conversation turned to Wayne's legacy and Lamarre believes every top 10 rapper should have at least three classic solo offerings, and he thinks Wayne has two with the second and third installments of Tha Carter, but not much else. “I'm adamant about saying his [albums] discography is not as strong as people think,” he declared. 


	Ultimately, the trio wants to see Wayne get back to the drawing board and lock in with a singular producer like Nas did with Hit-Boy to bring that greatness out of him. When the dust settled, Shannon gave Trevor Anderson the victory in the first game of the revamped Unfiltered series.

The actress plays an unhoused Seattle woman who goes to battle against a tow company in Stephanie Laing's feature, co-starring Octavia Spencer, Ariana DeBose and Demi Lovato.

Arts & Culture Critic


	A phrase that Amanda Ogle, the no-nonsense protagonist played by Rose Byrne in Stephanie Laing's touching film Tow, hears a lot is “people like you.” Strangers reach for it when referring to her situation as an unhoused woman in Seattle, Washington, living in her car. Social services workers — or anyone tasked with helping her — use it to preface their shock at her determination. Passers-by, assuming she is down on her luck, deploy it like a compliment, as if Amanda's intrepidness in the face of bureaucratic systems and run-of-the-mill social indifference is a testament to her personality rather than a necessary response to state failure.

	Amanda has a particularly hard time stomaching this phrase when her car — a 1991 Blue Toyota Camry — gets towed. Employees of this large auto company hauled her car, which was stolen while she was interviewing for a job at a high-end pet salon, without a second thought about its value. In addition to living in the vehicle, Amanda needs the car to get the gig. When asked if she could pick up clients' dogs, she, eager to get back on her feet and put her veterinary tech license to use, said yes. So it's more than an inconvenience when Amanda walks out of the salon to find her car missing.

The Bottom Line

	
	Boosted by Byrne's affecting turn.
	



Venue: Tribeca Film Festival (Spotlight Narrative)Cast: Rose Byrne, Octavia Spencer, Dominic Sessa, Ariana DeBose, Demi Lovato, Simon RexDirector: Stephanie LaingScreenwriters: Jonathan Keasey, Brant Boivin, Annie Weisman

								1 hour 45 minutes			






	Premiering at Tribeca, Tow follows Amanda as she spends more than a year trying to get her car back from a tow yard. The film is inspired by the real story of an unhoused Seattle woman who fought an impressive legal battle against a tow company in order to get her vehicle back and clear an outrageous bill. Laing's compassionate adaptation of the story details Amanda's life before the tow-company nightmare and chronicles how the Seattle resident survives the city while navigating this taxing clash. Similar to Harris Dickinson's stirring Cannes debut Urchin, Tow spotlights issues around homelessness and addiction with empathy, a grounded realism and a touch of humor. 

	











	Working from a screenplay by Jonathan Keasey, Brant Boivin and Annie Weisman, Laing (Family Squares, Irreplaceable You) opens Tow with a statistic about vehicular residents across the country: The number of people who live in their cars falls somewhere between 1 and 3 million people. When we meet Amanda, she's floundering in an already bad job interview. When the employer asks why Amanda has a vet tech license but no college degree, she becomes deflated. The interview ends with no job.


	Laing steadily shepherds viewers through glimpses of Amanda's life: We see her charging her phone in various establishments, texting her teenage daughter Avery (Elsie Fisher) and figuring out where she can park her car and get a good night's rest. That last task proves to be the most challenging, and the scene of Amanda being harassed by neighborhood patrol reminded me of moments in Patrick Fealey's harrowing account of being unhoused in America, which the writer published last year in Esquire magazine. His and Amanda's experiences underscore how expensive it is to be poor in the U.S.


	After reporting her missing vehicle to the unhelpful officers at the local precinct, Amanda finally locates her Camry in a tow yard. She begs the attendant (Simon Rex) to release the vehicle, but he, with a touch of shame, admits he doesn't have the authority to do so. So Amanda, whom Byrne plays with a spunky persistence (think Frances McDormand in Nomadland with more perk), decides to go after the corporation that owns the tow yard. 

	











	Her story adopts the contours, and possesses the easy-to-root for energy, of all David vs. Goliath stories. In a small claims court, Amanda decides to represent herself, and her stirring testimony — plus the failure of the tow company's legal counsel to show up — persuades the presiding judge to grant her a court order to retrieve the vehicle. The only problem is that her car is no longer in the yard; having been moved through the system, it is on its way to an auction and then likely a junkyard. 


	Amanda doesn't give up, though. She finds a church shelter run by a steely woman named Barb (Octavia Spencer) and enlists the help of Kevin (The Holdovers‘ Dominic Sessa), a rookie lawyer propelled by an endearing if clumsy idealism. He takes over her case by helping her file claims with the superior courts. At the shelter, Amanda forms genuine friendships with other unhoused people like Nova (Demi Lovato), a pregnant mother, and Denise (Ariana DeBose), a recovering addict whose cutting remarks and humor mask the pain of losing custody of her children. They help Amanda navigate her own alcohol dependency as well as the challenges in her relationship with her daughter.


	Laing doesn't opt exclusively for documentary-style realism like Dickinson does in Urchin. Tow leans into the natural comedy that arises from elements of Amanda's situation without glamorizing the plight of the downtrodden. The score, composed by Este Haim (one third of the band Haim) and Nathan Barr (Salem's Lot, The Diplomat), highlights the more whimsical moments in Amanda's life, from coaxing the employees of the luxury grooming salon to give her a job to lightly mocking Kevin for all the ways he thinks he understands her. Vanja Cernjul's unfussy cinematography relies on tight shots to lend the film intimacy, though one is left yearning for more sweeping views of Seattle. That wider perspective could have underscored the stark differences between the wealthy tech entrepreneurs Amanda references at one point and everyone else just scraping by. 

	











	Still, in its modest way, Tow sends a powerful message about how many of us have more in common with a person sleeping in a car than we do the billionaires we've been conditioned to admire.

ByPeter Suciu,

 Contributor. 

A new theory being widely shared on social media is that President Donald Trump may be wearing a "hidden" leg brace. The unsubstantiated claims took hold after the president, who will turn 79 on Saturday, stumbled while boarding Air Force One last weekend. Trump's slip on the stairs to the presidential aircraft was quickly compared to that of former President Biden while also boarding the plane.

Images have since circulated on various online platforms of Trump inspecting work in the Rose Garden on Monday, which appeared to show "bulges" in his trousers, possibly indicating the presence of leg braces. That soon set off a wave of theories.

In one, it was suggested that Trump's decision to create a Mar-a-Lago-style patio in the famous White House Rose Garden was because he has trouble walking on thick grass and would be steadier on pavement. However, the administration has said it is because the heels of women attending events can sink into the ground when it is wet or even damp.

Another theory that gained traction was that Trump was wearing a Foley catheter, possibly due to bladder issues. Still, others said it would enable the president to give lengthy speeches or attend events without needing to excuse himself to use the bathroom.

The White House has dismissed the claims as "fake news."

This is hardly the first time that a slip on the stairs of Air Force One or an ill-fitting suit has been seen as being at least somewhat "newsworthy." In the social media era, such matters can't go unnoticed.

Trump often joined, if he hadn't already led, the efforts to call out any misstep by former President Joe Biden, when images and videos circulated of Biden slipping or tripping while boarding Air Force One.

The previous administration, aware of how quickly a minor mistake can go viral, took steps to minimize the risk of falls on the presidential aircraft. That included having Biden use the shorter stairway, which, in turn, still drew attention and highlighted the question of his age and his ability to serve in the highest office.

An irony for Mr. Biden is that he may have inadvertently caused some of the issues. Just weeks after winning the 2020 election, Biden suffered a hairline fracture on his foot while playing with one of his dogs. Not wanting to appear weak or feeble, he reportedly refused to wear the walking boot when cameras were around. The inconsistency in wearing the boot may have contributed to his persistent stiff gait, which became increasingly noticeable during his presidency.

There is the old saying that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but the truth is also in the eye of those who see what they want to see. It was in the pre-social media days, but some claims still went "viral" in 2004 that former President George W. Bush had worn a radio receiver connected to an earpiece that fed him answers during a debate with then-Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.

The only "evidence" was a bulge in Bush's jacket. If social media had been around, it likely would have received even more scrutiny.

Similar allegations were leveled against former Vice President Kamala Harris during last September's debate with Trump, with some users claiming she wore a pair of Nova H1 Audio earphones disguised as pearl earrings. The fact that the earnings were part of a Kickstarter campaign and never released didn't squelch the rumors. Whether the rumors swayed voter opinion is unclear, but it is a reminder that perception matters.

It hasn't just been fashion-related issues that now trend on social media, either.

In 2016, rumors also circulated that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was replaced by a body double to conceal serious health issues. It came after Clinton was forced to leave a 9/11 memorial event early after feeling overheated and was diagnosed with pneumonia. It wasn't the only, or even the most high-profile, rumor that dogged Clinton, but it certainly didn't help her campaign.

There have also been allegations that the mainstream media didn't dig deep enough into Biden's stumbles, including a fall on stage during the June 2023 U.S. Air Force Academy graduation ceremony. Critics of Mr. Biden argue that it wasn't just White House insiders who concealed his decline, but that the media also failed to do their job, a failure that now seems far more apparent.

It wasn't until the presidential debate between Biden and Trump last June that the issue became too difficult to ignore. Still, questions about Biden's fitness had already been regularly raised on social media. That has given credence to the claim that social media covers news stories that the mainstream media won't.

The truth is that until the modern era, the media didn't cover such aspects of the presidency. It was readily apparent that Franklin Roosevelt's health was declining, but the country was shocked when he passed away in April 1945, just months into his record fourth term.

It didn't become widely known that he was confined to a wheelchair until after his death. Such matters weren't considered newsworthy at the time. Likewise, the public didn't know of his or most presidents' extramarital affairs. The media simply didn't focus on such things.

That changed over time, and the world likely knew too many details about former President Bill Clinton's activities in the Oval Office. In the social media era, such rumors can circulate, even if they're not true.

The flip side is that just as social media is quick to suggest a cover-up is underway, detractors will offer a counter-narrative. Failing that, there is always the "WhatAboutism" argument to fall back on. If Trump slips on the stairs of Air Force One, as soon as a video appears on X, ten more will follow, showing Biden looking worse, and possibly a few vintage ones of Gerald R. Ford slipping on Air Force One's stairs will circulate for good measure.

And as for the leg brace, it may go viral, but it will only be believed by those critical of the sitting president. His supporters won't see it, or at least won't care. The divide is simply too great, but that's what social media does best. It divides while keeping everyone engaged. And because there is now so much misinformation, it is hard to know what, if anything, on the platforms is the truth.

That's what we all need to brace for!

Syfy's new supernatural horror series, Revival, debuts Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Adapted from the Image Comics series of the same name created by Tim Seeley and Mike Norton, Syfy's Revival TV series is created by Aaron B. Koontz and Luke Boyce. Revival stars Melanie Scrofano, Romy Weltman, David James Elliott, and Andy McQueen, with Steven Ogg, Gia Sandhu, Karherine King, and WWE superstar CM Punk in recurring roles.

Revival debuted on Syfy on Thursday, June 12, and has received positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Thus far, Revival is rated Fresh at 83% with 6 reviews. Revival season 1 will consist of 10 episodes, and the critics who have reviewed the series have been generally favorable, especially about series lead Melanie Scrofano, who plays police officer Dana Cypress. Check out Revival's Rotten Tomatoes score below:

Revival joins other popular recent hits on Syfy like Resident Alien and Chucky. Critics on Rotten Tomatoes hail Revival as "a spiritual successor" to Melanie Scrofano's prior series, Wynonna Earp, and praise Scrofano and the cast for elevating the series from its comic book roots. Revival also drew favor for "not taking itself too seriously" compared to other supernatural zombie series.

 Revival's cast led by Melanie Scrofano is a draw. Scrofano is also known for her recurring role in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds as Captain Marie Batel. One of Scrofano's Revival co-stars, Gia Sandhu, also plays T'Pring, the Vulcan fiancée of Spock (Ethan Peck), on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. CM Punk, who also appeared in Netflix's wrestling drama Heels, brings his own fanbase, and Steven Ogg is a popular familiar face for his various roles in TV series like Snowpiercer and video games like Grand Theft Auto.

Revival's warm reception is great news for Melanie Scrofano, who stars in two shows in summer 2025. Along with Revival, Scrofano returns as Captain Batel in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3. The back end of Revival's 10-episode season 1 will coincide with the first few weeks of Strange New Worlds season 3, which premieres on July 17 on Paramount+.

The Warrior Nun cancellation by Netflix after just two well-received seasons still stings, but one SyFy show could soothe the pain.

If Revival proves to be a hit that lasts a few seasons on Syfy, it takes some of the sting out of the announcement that Star Trek: Strange New Worlds is ending with season 5. Scrofano has amassed a solid and loyal fan base that has followed her since Wynonna Earp and its follow-up, Wynonna Earp: Vengeance. Revivial's strong start and Fresh Rotten Tomatoes score should help jumpstart it to become another mainstay for Syfy.

An update surrounding Wheel of Time's season 4 confirms that despite waiting 31 years for the adaptation, viewers will have to face one harsh reality.

Times have evolved since the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer series in the '90s, and these 6 things need to change for the 21st-century reboot.

Brandon Sanderson, the author behind the final Wheel of Time books, has given his fascinating input on the Amazon Prime show's cancellation.

There have been many great fantasy TV shows that pushed the genre forward, but these series are considered benchmarks for all other fantasy shows.

A fan petition to save The Wheel of Time after cancellation has earned a significant number of signatures, but what are its honest chances of success?

Mike Flanagan shares a new update on The Dark Tower that breaks down how faithful the adaptation will be and some of the challenges that come with it.

Silo is ending with season 4 is perfect because it seems to ensure that the next two seasons of the series will avoid repeating one season 2 mistake.

For nearly a decade, Donald Trump has tried to reject the legitimacy of those who protest against him, falsely accusing them of being “paid protesters.” It's a pitch rooted in an ugly assumption: Americans who disagree with the president can only be explained by corrupt schemes and illicit payments. 

Those who side with Republicans are real, the argument goes, while Americans who disagree must be seen as inauthentic.

As aggressive tactics from Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents spark a public backlash, the president has leaned into the “paid protesters” line with increased vigor and enthusiasm. Trump pushed the line during his remarks to U.S. troops at Fort Bragg this week — he claimed that an unnamed, nefarious person is secretly “financing” the protests in Los Angeles, for example — and echoed the evidence-free claim to reporters at Andrews Air Force base soon after. He repeated the line again at the Kennedy Center a day later.

When a reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt who, exactly, the president believes is paying the protesters, instead of answering the question, she claimed that Trump has “a lot of common sense” — despite the fact that his conspiracy theory is neither common nor sensible.

But even more interesting were the comments from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard during her recent Fox News appearance.

“This is something that the Department of Justice and the FBI are looking into. Who is funding these protestors?” the DNI asked rhetorically. Gabbard added that she believes that protesters are “obviously” being “orchestrated.”

For now, let's not dwell on the fact that it's not at all “obvious” that a secret rascal is putting up enormous amounts of money to pay people to protest against the president and his agenda. Given the scope of the public outrage, the idea that the protesters — in L.A. and in cities across the country — are being paid is plainly silly.

But I'm wondering if Gabbard is correct about what federal law enforcement is “looking into.”

Just because the DNI claimed that Trump's conspiracy theory is generating Justice Department and FBI scrutiny doesn't mean that it's actually happening. Gabbard says all sorts of things that have little bearing on reality, so it's best not to make any assumptions.

But if she's correct, it's unsettling to think federal law enforcement resources have been diverted in such a ridiculous way.

What's more, there's a larger pattern to consider. The New York Times reported this week that top officials at the DOJ and the FBI are scrambling to keep up with Trump priorities that are “rooted in misinformation and conspiracy theories.” The article added that Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino are now “running what amounts to a conspiracy theory fulfillment center with unstocked shelves, critics say.”

With this in mind, Gabbard's claims might've sounded outlandish, but they might very well have been right.

      Here's my spiel. 99.99% of the content and the talking heads on this sub are a distraction from the fact that the UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program David Grusch uncovered is real, has been confirmed as a credible and urgent issue by the Intelligence Community Inspector General, with program members (including those who handle biologics) having been brought to DC by Grusch to testify to Congressional staffers, including Senators Schumer, Rounds, Rubio, Gillibrand, and Young, all of who then created and sponsored the UAP Disclosure Act, which explicitly calls for the declassification of the existence of Non-Human Intelligence and recovered material and biologics via a specialized panel of experts under Executive Authority.
    


      Until this bill is passed or a catastrophic whistleblower leak comes out we have 0% chance of knowing the truth and will wear ourselves out guessing and hypothesizing what's in the locked box when we should be pressuring the people who hold the keys.
    


      99.99% of the talking heads and names we see in this sub on a weekly basis DO NOT have access and will NEVER have access to the REAL program - I'm talking Matthew Brown, Lue Elizondo, Jake Barber, Jay Stratton, Ross Coulthart, Tim Burchett, Anna Paulina Luna, Jeremy Corbell, Matt Ford, Diana Pasulska, James Fox, Garry Nolan, Jesse Michels, etc. etc.
    


      This extends to programs like Immaculate Constellation, AARO, AAWSAP, UAPTF, the new Secrets Task Force, The SOL Foundation, Skywatcher - NONE of these are the real program with the actual knowledge that would eliminate the need for so much hypothesizing and are only scratching the surface of what we actually know and have kept under lock and key. They are merely studying the smoke of the fire we have inside of a locked furnace.
    


      Grusch lit the fuse and Congress was given the power to either let this thing explode or cut the fuse. It's outrageous that the US Senate passed this bill but it was killed because of a select few in the House, but unfortunately that's how things go when you do it by the book and special interest gets involved.
    


      It's up to the public to pressure our representatives into a position where NOT supporting bills like the UAPDA would make them OVERWHELMINGLY unpopular to either the general populace or at least people powerful enough to impact their position. Let's try and focus on this and figure out how to unlock the truths we already know.
    


      I TOTALLY get the enthusiasm on this sub to try and squeeze blood from a stone while we sit in the dark and search for answers, but we shouldn't lose sight of what is REAL and verifiable and compelling and actionable amidst all of the claims, the rumors, and the theories that those of us on this sub or who follow the topic are inundated with.
    


      We are EXHAUSTING ourselves and anyone who might want to take an interest in this topic with WHAT IFS that could actually be answered if we just stayed focused for long enough to actually do something about it.

Ghosts. Demons. Cryptids. Telekinesis. Alien abduction. Psychic abilities. Paranormal forces like these beguile the mind and bamboozle the senses. Between two-thirds and three-quarters of Americans believe in at least one of them. 

This prevalence suggests that belief in the paranormal is a “feature, not a bug, of the human animal,” journalist Matt Hongoltz-Hetling writes in his new book, The Ghost Lab: How Bigfoot Hunters, Mediums, and Alien Enthusiasts Are Wrecking Science.

Despite the forceful title, Hongoltz-Hetling's book isn't a screed against Sasquatch stans or explorers of the spirit realm. With intellectual humility, he tells the story of New Hampshire's Kitt Research Initiative, a ragtag bunch of paranormal investigators who attempt to scientifically and skeptically scrutinize paranormal entities, from curses to cryptids. Ghost Lab is like a season of your favorite spooky, ghost-hunting television show, in which you grow to know and like the hunters, and maybe even understand what drives them.

Hongoltz-Hetling pairs this absorbing narrative with an exploration of institutional distrust. Why do so many Americans no longer trust such social pillars as religion, government, healthcare, education, and the media? And is the concurrent rise in paranormal belief linked in some way?

Big Think got in touch with Hongoltz-Hetling for a spoiler-free discussion about his book, paranormal belief, and the broader issue of institutional distrust. (The following interview has been edited for length and clarity)

Big Think: Why do so many people in New Hampshire see ghosts, aliens, and cryptids?

Hongoltz-Hetling: New Hampshire has a perfect storm of dynamics within its culture. First, New England is much more infused with a sense of history and age than other parts of the country; it was settled first, and there's a constant homage to the past. 

New Hampshire is also famously individualistic. This expresses itself in various ways. It's the country's libertarian hotspot. It has very high rates of atheism, which is sort of an opting out of an institution. It has its “Live free or die” motto. Those factors have also made New Hampshire the leader in institutional distrust. So all of those things together are a perfect recipe for breeding increased belief in supernatural phenomena. 

Showcasing this, New Hampshire has had some truly seminal moments in paranormal history. It was the site of the first widely popularized UFO abduction story, the Betty and Barney Hill incident.

I think [that incident] seeded the local and regional communities with a higher awareness of those sorts of things. Instead of just reading about it through an AP story or seeing it talked about on The Tonight Show, you may know somebody who is connected to this big UFO incident. And that was just one of a handful of incidents to have occurred in New Hampshire.

For all those reasons New Hampshire is in the perfect place at the perfect time to inherit an increased awareness of, and belief in, those “out there” phenomena. 

Big Think: What inspired you to spend so much time with and to write about a team of paranormal investigators?

Hongoltz-Hetling: I was a passionate believer and explorer of paranormal concepts when I was young, so I knew the landscape a little bit. Yet, I've had more of a skeptical mindset for my adult life.

When I'm asked now if I believe in ghosts, I often say “occasionally and fleetingly.” I walk around every day not believing, but then I hear something weird in the night and glimpse a shadow out of the corner of my eye, and my first thought is not an intruder. It's, “That's a spirit!” I have to consciously think and recognize that my gut instinct is incorrect.

We believe in science despite our human nature, not because of it.

Big Think: Let's get into these paranormal investigators that you followed, because they are really the stars of your book and made it a fascinating, fun read. How did you come across them? What was it like spending time with them?

Hongoltz-Hetling: I wanted to do something to exemplify the paranormal landscape and its relation to science and society. I considered a bunch of entry points into that story. I talked to a state legislator who is also a warlock. I talked to a woman who owned a haunted crepe restaurant. (To be clear, the restaurant was haunted, not the crepes!)  

What appealed to me about Andy [Kitt] was that he had become a big player in one paranormal group but left it to start another. That suggested conflict and differing points of view, and I was looking for those diversities of opinion within the ghost-hunting community. What is it about one group's beliefs that can be so controversial that one of their primary members left for another group? 

That keyed me into Andy, who is an unusual guy. He's smart, logical, and science-minded, but also socially brash and offensive. He prides himself on being offensive and associates it with being a straight-shooter — he “calls it like he sees it.” Andy was not particularly interested in the paranormal until the death of his father. Then a series of compelling personal experiences caused him to take up this idea of exploring paranormal phenomena with a scientific mindset.

So he founded the Kitt Research Initiative (KRI) and assembled an “Avengers” team of paranormal enthusiasts. He had a talented psychic medium. He had a Bigfoot hunter who also happened to be an alien abductee. He had a paralegal looking for an explanation for the voices in her head. He also had an empath who could feel the emotions of others, whether human or incorporeal entities. Together, these people clung to a common dream of applying critical thinking to suss out what's real versus what's not and to bring a veneer of respectability to the field.

Big Think: How did you feel about believers in the paranormal before hanging out with Andy and his crew, and how did you feel afterward?

Hongoltz-Hetling: My core beliefs remain the same: I walked into it skeptical of these phenomena, and I walked away skeptical. But I really changed how I think about the people who believe them. 

I thought they were nutty and bizarre, maybe even outright frauds. I realized that they're not crazy, they're not lying, and they're not stupid. These people had personal experiences that have been very compelling to them. 

Big Think: Your book delved deep into the psychology of paranormal belief. For example, you noted how widespread these beliefs are, calling them a “feature, not a bug, of the human animal.” Why do you think paranormal beliefs are so ingrained?

Hongoltz-Hetling: Our capacity to reason gives us the ability to understand and believe in scientific explanations for the universe's existence, but it's not what we're bred to believe. We believe in science despite our human nature, not because of it. Paranormal phenomena and the sense of wonder and mystery and awe that they spark in us are incredibly compelling. 

They almost always come with a story, and we all know the human affinity for stories. They also speak to our desire to impose order on random events. We hear gobbledegook white noise, and our mind searches for the words. It's satisfying when our mind believes it has made sense of a little bit of that white noise. Is a ghost speaking to us?

Big Think: What draws you to write about paranormal believers?

We're all looking at this global landscape where science is under fire, institutions are under fire, governments are under fire, public education is under fire, the church is under fire. The collective institutions that have dominated our lives for the last 80 years or so are losing public support. That's such an interesting and important dynamic. I want to understand what makes that tick. 

I like to do that by looking at the people who are outside the system and understanding them a little better — understanding why their beliefs and lifestyles are incompatible with more mainstream thinking. Also, these people are fun and colorful and wild.

People are allowed to have wacky beliefs. We have to find more tolerance for benign or neutral beliefs so we can leverage that to stomp out the parts of these belief systems that are truly harmful. 

Big Think: Why do you think a distrust in institutions helps breed a belief in the paranormal and vice versa?

Hongoltz-Hetling: Say you've had a strange, compelling personal experience: Plants are talking to you. You go to research it, and you find other people also believe plants speak to them. You're all pretty sure that your experiences are the real thing, and there are enough of you to create a protective and reinforcing bubble of belief. 

Then you look to the authorities, and they're not saying anything about this stuff. If they are, it's a fairly nasty and dismissive debunking. You believe plants talk to you? You're delusional. It's certainly not nice to hear. 

You may think, “If everyone in my community has these experiences, why has science not documented them?” You can only conclude that either science has an enormous blindspot [for something] a majority of Americans have experienced — these paranormal phenomena — or that scientists see the evidence but are hiding it. The authorities are actively corrupt and suppressing the truth.

Once you're gatewayed into that mindset, then you become a prime target for conspiracy theories across the spectrum.

Big Think: Can institutions gain trust back?

Hongoltz-Hetling: I feel like I've been obsessed with talking about my recommendations for institutions, in part because they are probably unpalatable to your average science-minded person.

As a matter of practicality, we have to recognize that when scientists debunk and deride spiritual beliefs for fear of legitimizing them, what's actually happening is they're kicking tons of people out of the tent, and science itself is becoming delegitimized. An obvious expression of that now is the threat to research funding that ultimately comes from a populist, anti-expertise movement that also leans on new-age spiritual beliefs. 

Institutions have to hold space and free pathways that allow for an expression of these beliefs and turn our 80,000 working psychic mediums, 6,000 or more ghost-hunting groups, and one million alien abductees into stakeholders. 

[For example], if you believe you've been abducted by an alien, you can't seek treatment from a therapist or a psychologist because they will call you delusional. We need to have protocols in our medical profession that can deal with these things as a metaphor for underlying evidence-driven explanations for what's going on.

There's an example of this in the Muslim world. A lot of clinicians will treat what's described as Jinn possession, where a person says they've been possessed by an evil entity. The medical professional has access to a holy man who can come in and perform an exorcism of that Jinn. Embedded within that ritual are evidence-based treatments. So, the patient receives a satisfactory treatment for their belief, and the practitioner also provides evidence-based care.

People are allowed to have wacky beliefs. We have to find more tolerance for benign or neutral beliefs so we can leverage that to stomp out the parts of these belief systems that are truly harmful. 

Big Think: How can institutions regain the trust of the public more broadly?

Hongoltz-Hetling: We know that people are more likely to believe in supernatural things when they feel like they don't have control of a situation. In this period of political instability and economic turmoil, many people are feeling out of control.

If our institutions can communicate their work better, supernatural beliefs will dry up a bit. We've seen this historically. 

Are institutions on a path to do that? I don't know. People have been calling for reform for a long time, and it hasn't happened. The distortion filter of the internet makes everything worse because it magnifies small flaws. But there are pathways that institutions can take.

Big Think: Can the rift between paranormal believers and their skeptics ever be closed?

Hongoltz-Hetling: I do think there's a path. The Kitt Research Initiative had this idea that they would do true scientific explanations of the paranormal, and their honest effort was appealing to both believers and skeptics.

Andy embodies this aesthetic. He knows the language of skepticism and the language of belief. If there were more people who understood both worldviews, it becomes quite easy to hold them both in your head.
