                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police handcuffed Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., and pushed him to the ground Thursday after forcibly removing him from a press conference Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was holding in Los Angeles. Padilla had entered the room and interrupted Noem as she was speaking about her department's plans to continue deportation efforts in California, even as the Trump administration's recent immigration enforcement operations have stirred a wave of protests. DHS blamed Padilla for the altercation, but said he and Noem later held a 15-minute meeting. "I am Senator Alex Padilla," he says as the officers push him toward an exit and he pushes back with his body, the video shows. "I have questions for the secretary, because the fact of the matter is, a half a dozen violent criminals that you're rotating on your, on your," Padilla says before being overwhelmed by multiple officers and shoved out of the room. A voice is then heard on the video saying that no recording is allowed in the hallway. "If this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they're doing to farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers throughout the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country," he said. Padilla's office said in a statement that the seantor was in LA to exercise "his duty to perform Congressional oversight of the federal government's operations in Los Angeles and across California." "He was in the federal building to receive a briefing with General Guillot and was listening to Secretary Noem's press conference," the statement said. "He tried to ask the Secretary a question, and was forcibly removed by federal agents, forced to the ground and handcuffed." DHS defended the officers' actions and accused Padilla of engaging in "disrespectful political theatre." The senator "interrupted a live press conference without identifying himself or having his Senate security pin on as he lunged toward Secretary Noem," the department said in a statement on X. The video shows Padilla did verbally identify himself as a senator prior to his removal. DHS added that Padilla "did not comply with officers' repeated commands" to back away. It also claimed that U.S. Secret Service agents "thought he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately." Nevertheless, "Secretary Noem met with Senator Padilla after and held a 15 minute meeting," DHS said. "I just saw something that sickened my stomach: The manhandling of a United States senator," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the floor of his chamber. "We need immediate answers to what the hell went on," Schumer said. "What just happened to @SenAlexPadilla is absolutely abhorrent and outrageous," Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass wrote on X. Gavin Newsom, who has clashed with President Donald Trump over his administration's immigration operations in LA, wrote, "If they can handcuff a U.S. Senator for asking a question, imagine what they will do to you."

Trump's Immigration Policy:

US ICE agents detain a suspect during a multi-agency targeted enforcement operation in Lyons, Illinois, on Jan. 26.

President Donald Trump conceded that his immigration crackdown was hurting US businesses and said policy changes covering farmworkers and the hotel industry will be made to address worker shortages. 

“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “Changes are coming.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Senate on Thursday confirmed Billy Long as the next IRS Commissioner, which could mark a shift for taxpayers amid sweeping agency cuts. But Senate Republicans confirmed Long via a party-line vote. During the confirmation process, Long faced Democratic scrutiny over Trump loyalties and ties to dubious tax credits, among other questions, which he addressed during a May Senate Finance Committee hearing and written testimony. More from Personal Finance: Trump's 'big beautiful' spending bill could curb low-income tax creditHere's what's happening with unemployed Americans — in five chartsHere's the economic cost of the Trump, Harvard battle over student visas In written testimony, Long said he would "follow the law" when asked for specifics about how he would respond to political favor requests from Trump. But it's currently unclear what Long as IRS Commissioner will mean for taxpayers, he said. Long's confirmation comes amid widespread IRS cuts from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The hiring freeze, deferred resignation programs and reductions in force "will have significant impacts" on IRS operations, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, or TIGTA, said in a June 6 report. A separate TIGTA report from May found the agency had lost nearly one-third of its so-called revenue agents, who conduct audits, as of March 2025. The "tax gap" — federal levies incurred but not paid voluntarily on time — was estimated at $696 billion for tax year 2022, according to the latest IRS data. Meanwhile, Trump's fiscal 2026 budget request calls for a 37% reduction in IRS spending, including staffing and technology cuts. These reductions could impact revenue collections, according to a Budget Lab at Yale analysis. In a May House Appropriations subcommittee hearing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said "collections" were among his IRS priorities. He said "smarter IT" and the "AI boom" could help meet revenue goals. In 2022, Congress approved nearly $80 billion in IRS funding, with more than half earmarked for enforcement of corporate and high-net-worth tax dodgers. As the agency faces cuts, it could also soon see more administrative work once Republicans enact sweeping tax changes via Trump's big beautiful spending bill. This could be challenging amid staffing cuts, experts say. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Late Wednesday, Chime raised about $700 million in its offering, and existing investors sold an additional $165 million worth of shares. Chime's initial public offering, from a valuation perspective, represents a big step down from where venture investors like Sequoia Capital valued the company in its last fundraising round in 2021, when private tech markets were raging. Still, Chime's offering is the latest sign that the fintech IPO market is opening up after a multi-year freeze brought on by rising interest rates and valuation resets. Recent debuts from eToro and crypto company Circle have rekindled optimism in the sector, with both stocks seeing strong initial pops. "Two-thirds of our customer base use us as their direct deposit account and primary account relationship," Britt told CNBC's David Faber. "We help our members avoid fees, get access to short-term liquidity, build their credit and build their savings — and it's that combination of services that really resonates and matters most to the everyday consumer." Britt said the company reached $25 million in adjusted profitability in the first quarter and has improved its adjusted profit margin by 40 points over the past two years. The company's top institutional shareholders are DST Global and Crosslink Capital. Iconiq was one of the firms that invested six years ago, when Chime raised money at a $1.5 billion valuation. "We first invested in Chime in 2019 and continued to invest through subsequent rounds because of their singular, unwavering focus on serving everyday Americans — and the trust they've built with that core customer base," Yoonkee Sull, general partner at Iconiq, said in an interview. Active member growth rose 23% in the first quarter from a year earlier, Britt said, with 8.6 million monthly active users and an increasing number turning to Chime to serve as their primary banking relationship. Chime disclosed in its prospectus that it spent $1.4 billion on marketing between 2022 and 2024. Britt said the retention rate is above 90% once users set up direct deposit. "Sometimes for people, it takes a change in life — a change in their career, a job change — to be the point in time when they actually make the switch and use us as a primary bank account," he said. The company's core revenue comes from interchange fees, the charges merchants pay when consumers swipe Chime-issued debit or credit cards. Britt said 72% of Chime's revenue is payments driven, versus traditional banks that rely heavily on fees from overdrafts and minimum balances. "It's pretty simplistic," said Dan Dolev, an analyst at Mizuho. "I'm actually surprised by how unsophisticated that business model is." Several other fintech players, including Klarna, Gemini and Bullish, have already filed for IPOs publicly or confidentially. "If it goes well — and you'll know that in the next two to three months — I think you'll see much more receptivity" from other companies in the pipeline, said David Golden, partner at Revolution Ventures and former head of tech investment banking at JPMorgan Chase. "If it doesn't go well," Golden added, "I think they'll continue just to sit on their hands and wait it out." Chime is a five-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company, having made the annual list from 2020-2024.

Air India Crash:

The crash site of Air India Ltd. Flight 171 in Ahmedabad, India, on June 12.

US President Donald Trump expressed his condolences after the deadly crash of a Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner operated by Air India that left hundreds dead, saying he had offered “pointers” on possible causes as well as an offer of assistance to Indian authorities.

“I gave them a couple of pointers. I said, ‘Maybe you look at this,' you know, we saw the plane, it looked like it was flying pretty well, it didn't look like there was an explosion, just looked like the engines maybe lost power,” Trump said at an event Thursday at the White House.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oracle shares soared 15% on Thursday and headed for a record close and their best day since 2021, after the database software vendor issued robust earnings and a strong forecast, fueled by growth in cloud. Revenue climbed 11% year over year during the fiscal fourth quarter to $15.9 billion, topping the $15.59 billion average estimate, according to LSEG. "All told, ORCL has entered an entirely new wave of enterprise popularity that it has not seen since the Internet era in the late 90s," Piper Sandler analysts wrote in a note to clients. The firm was one of several to lift its price target on the stock, raising its prediction to $190 from $130. Oracle has been making headway in the cloud infrastructure market to challenge Amazon, Google and Microsoft. It's still small by comparison, with $3 billion in cloud revenue during the May quarter, compared with over $12 billion for Google, which counts productivity software subscriptions and cloud infrastructure sales when reporting cloud metrics. Future expansion can also come from sales of Oracle's database on clouds other than its own. "The growth rate in multi-cloud is astonishing," Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said on Wednesday's conference call with analysts. "In other words, our database is now moving very rapidly to the cloud, I think because – a few reasons, because the database has now all these AI capabilities, but also, quite frankly, now people can get it in whatever cloud they want." Remaining performance obligations, a measurement of money that's expected to be recognized as revenue in the future, sat at $138 billion, up 41% from a year earlier. Oracle CEO Safra Catz said RPO will likely more than double in the 2026 fiscal year, which ends in May 2026. Revenue for the new fiscal year should come in above $67 billion, she said. Gains from OpenAI's Stargate artificial intelligence data center project, targeting $500 billion in investments over four years, are not yet included in forecasts. "If Stargate turns out to be, everything is advertised, then we've understated our RPO growth," Ellison said. For fiscal 2029, revenue should be above the $104 billion target the company set in September, Catz said. "Demand continues to dramatically outstrip supply," Catz said, though she added that the company isn't having trouble sourcing Nvidia graphics processing units. But they noted that, "with the backdrop of continued capacity constraints, we struggle to see a path to meaningful acceleration in the near term."

A Tesla Inc. Optimus robot at the Paris Motor Show in Paris, on Oct. 15.

Tesla Inc. sued a former engineer with the company's highly secretive Optimus program, accusing him of stealing confidential information about the humanoid robot and setting up a rival startup in Silicon Valley. 

Zhongjie “Jay” Li worked at Tesla between August 2022 and September 2024, according to a complaint filed in a San Francisco Federal Court late Wednesday. Li worked on “advanced robotic hand sensors—and was entrusted with some of the most sensitive technical data in the program,” Tesla's lawyers said in the complaint.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump ripped Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as a "numbskull" on Thursday as he turned up the heat on the central bank chief to lower interest rates. Trump claimed at the White House that lowering rates by 2 percentage points would save the U.S. $600 billion per year, "but we can't get this guy to do it." "We're going to spend $600 billion a year, $600 billion because of one numbskull that sits here [and says] 'I don't see enough reason to cut the rates now,'" Trump said. "But it's down," he said, "and I may have to force something." Trump's insult came hours after the Labor Department reported that U.S. producer prices rose less in May than some economists anticipated. That and other recent economic readings have calmed some fears about a sudden tariff-induced inflation spike — and galvanized Trump and his allies to ramp up pressure on the Fed. Trump's latest attack on Powell was the third time in two days that a member of his administration has targeted the central bank leader. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Wednesday night, "It's unbelievable how much we would save if [Powell] did his job and he cut interest rates." Inflation is low," Lutnick said on Fox News. Earlier Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance wrote in a social media post, "the refusal by the Fed to cut rates is monetary malpractice." Markets were mostly unmoved by Trump's remarks, which continued his recent efforts to brand Powell with the nickname "Too Late." Traders have priced in virtually no chance that the Fed will cut rates following its meeting next week, and little chance of a move at its July gathering. Traders did assign a stronger chance of a cut in September, with odds running at about 76% on Thursday, compared with 69% a day ago, according to CME Group data. Investors were spooked in April when Trump appeared to be considering an attempt to fire Powell before his term expires next year. The president backed off following a bout of market volatility, and has not threatened to fire Powell since then. Trump in Thursday's remarks repeated that he is "not going to fire" Powell, but added, "I don't know why it would be so bad." Powell has said that the law does not permit the president to fire him, and the Supreme Court suggested in May that Fed governors have more protection against termination than other federal agency heads. — CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

The US stock market is back on track and within spitting distance of February's all-time highs. Yet corporate executives are dumping shares at the fastest clip since November.

A gauge of insider sentiment, which tracks the numbers of buyers versus sellers, shows that 200 insiders bought shares this month through June 11, while 778 sold shares, according to data compiled by the Washington Service. That puts the buy to sell ratio at around 0.26, the lowest since November when Trump's reelection triggered a months-long rally. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[The stream is slated to start at 11 a.m. Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.] President Donald Trump on Thursday is signing three congressional resolutions that target California's statewide efforts to adopt electric vehicles and phase out diesel engines and the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035. California's plan had been adopted by 11 other states. "It's been a disaster for this country," Trump said at the White House. "We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California's electric vehicle mandate," Trump said. "And they're never coming back." General Motors and Toyota had lobbied against California's rules. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, during the Biden administration, in December granted California a waiver allowing a mandate that most automotive sales in the state be electric vehicles. "Because they have to build a car, they can't build 19 different cars called the same thing." "Big polluters and the right-wing propaganda machine have succeeded in buying off the Republican Party," Newsom said. We want to hear from you.

NASA's car-sized Perseverance rover has been roaming the surface of Mars for four years, drilling into the alien soil to collect dirt it places in tubes and leaves on the ground.

Engineers designed Perseverance to be the first step in the agency's exploration of the Red Planet. In the future, more robotic spacecraft would arrive to sweep up the capsules and rocket them back to Earth, where scientists could look for signs that Mars once was, or is, a world with life.</p>
