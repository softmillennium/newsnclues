                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase teams up with American Express to offer its first credit card, giving up to 4% back in Bitcoin—exclusively for Coinbase One subscribers. Coinbase is launching its first-ever branded credit card in partnership with American Express, set to roll out this fall. Called the Coinbase One Card, it will be available only to U.S. members of Coinbase One, the platform's monthly subscription service. “We see real potential in the combination of Coinbase and crypto with the powerful backing of American Express, and what the card offers is an excellent mix of what customers are looking for right now,” said Will Stredwick, head of American Express global network services, during the Coinbase State of Crypto Summit in New York. The card is part of a larger push by Coinbase to expand its subscription-based services. The company also announced a cheaper version—Coinbase Basic—for $4.99/month or $49.99/year, which includes fewer features. According to William Blair analyst Andrew Jeffrey, this kind of recurring revenue is a big reason why long-term investors are sticking with the stock. Launched in 2023, Coinbase One now has over a million members. The company has long positioned Bitcoin at the center of its strategy—offering BTC custody services to institutions, supporting Bitcoin ETFs, integrating Bitcoin rewards into its products, and actively advocating for Bitcoin-friendly regulation in Washington. Coinbase also supports Bitcoin development directly through funding grants and engineering support. Established in 2012, Bitcoin Magazine is the oldest and most established source of trustworthy news, information and thought leadership on Bitcoin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum builders outlined a “Lean Ethereum” roadmap that aims to trim layer-1 complexity while hardening security, according to researcher Thomas Coratger on June 12 via X. It proposes three guiding targets: security, simplicity, and optimality. Coratger wrote that the roadmap calls for post-quantum-ready signatures and reworked data availability to guard the ledger against future cryptographic threats. He added that simplicity would come from slimming consensus, execution, and data layers so new contributors can audit code without steep learning curves. Optimality aims to achieve lower latency and overhead, keeping Ethereum competitive while maintaining its decentralization. Buterin illustrated the effort with four research tracks already under review. The first is a three-step-finality (3SF) protocol that delivers rapid block finality in a compact codebase, while the second is aggregated post-quantum signatures. A third research track focuses on zero-knowledge virtual machines that enable verifiable execution, with a data-layer refactor that merges blobs through erasure coding, rounding up the tracks. Drake connected those tracks to existing strategy items, including user-experience upgrades, scalability work, and full-chain sampling. Furthermore, Drake laid out several near-term proposals under the “lean” banner, including lean staking, which would strip validator duties to the essentials. Lean verifiability would let low-power devices confirm blocks with modest bandwidth. A lean crypto approach would reduce the protocol's reliance on multiple primitives, favoring a single hash function and post-quantum schemes wherever possible. He also promoted “lean specs,” breaking logic into small modules, and “lean formal verification,” starting with zk-VMs and signature aggregation. Coratger noted the alignment between these ideas and active engineering work, such as Fork-Choice enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL), zkEVM pilots, and beam roadmap prototypes. He reported that session participants acknowledged the difficulty of achieving optimality but viewed the payoff as worthwhile, especially as rollups and centralized sequencers reshape Layer 2 processing. Ethereum Foundation co-executive director Tomasz Stańczak described Drake's presentation as a forward-looking synthesis of current projects and longer-range research. Stanczak wrote that many ideas will proceed to testing while others will evolve, calling the roadmap an “unifying theory” rather than an immediate directive. He added that the talk motivated contributors by tying today's milestones to a broader technical horizon. Core teams plan to refine design documents, prototype features such as mini-3SF, and evaluate trade-offs in working group calls. His expertise primarily focuses on the Brazilian blockchain ecosystem and developments in decentralized finance (DeFi). Specializing in financial journalism, he now focuses on crypto reporting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum Token Platform Zora Sues Deloitte Over AI Trademark Dispute Ethereum token platform Zora has sued Deloitte to stop it from using the “Zora AI” name for its digital workforce AI platform, claiming trademark infringement. Zora gained steam during the NFT bull run of 2021-22, raising $50 million in funding in 2022 that valued the firm at $600 million. More recently, it has functioned as a social media platform that automatically turns every post into a token on Coinbase's Ethereum layer-2 network, Base. When it launched in April, the ZORA token briefly climbed as high as $0.03438 on its opening day, but has since slumped to $0.009324—down 73% from peak. The token has seen $21.7 million worth of trading volume in the past day and currently has a market cap of $29 million. Deloitte first started marketing its new AI platform in March, promoting it as a suite of “ready-to-deploy” agents that can augment clients' workforces. “As you must be aware, Zora is one of the most prominent marketplace platforms in which users can mint, buy, offer for sale, sell, and curate NFTs. Zora provides an innovative AI-driven method, including for consumers to use in creating NFTs and undertaking NFT-related transactions,” the company's lawyers wrote in a Feb. 14 letter to Deloitte. The trademarks protect the company's use of “Zora” in relation to downloadable mobile apps or software, cryptocurrency exchange services, and non-downloadable web applications. Stephen Barrese, a trademark attorney at Dilworth & Barrese, told Decrypt that if Deloitte's attorneys did a search, they would have seen pending applications for two of Zora's most recent trademarks. "This explains why Deloitte's argument is that there's no way that people would confuse the NFT platform with their digital workforce platform," Barrese added. Sure enough, that's exactly how Deloitte responded to Zora's letter a few weeks later. “We do not believe that you or your client should have any cause for concern,” Deloitte wrote in response. “Our use of ‘Zora AI' is for different goods and services than those offered by your client, as well as intended for a different audience than your client, such that there would not be any likelihood of consumer confusion.” A response from Zora in March goes even further, pointing out that Zora has been a client of Deloitte since 2022, and blasts the firm's “blatant disregard of its clients' basic intellectual rights.” The complaint includes an email that notes the token launchpad was being advised by Rob Massey, who's a tax leader in Deloitte's blockchain and digital assets practice. “Rob asked that Zora give him the opportunity to discuss internally and thus hold off on escalating this matter to a court,” Zora attorney Merri Moken wrote in an email last week ahead of the June 9 deadline she'd given Deloitte to respond. The lawsuit was filed on June 11 in the Southern District of New York and has been assigned to Judge Arun Subramanian. Deloitte did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum reclaimed a significant technical level in the latest 24-hour trading session, with its price crossing above the $2,800 mark and briefly touching $2,870. The move comes amid rising bullish momentum flowing out from Bitcoin, and according to recent analysis from a crypto expert, this could be just the beginning of a much larger rally for Ethereum. Technical Pattern Says Ethereum Could Be Close To $20,000 An interesting technical formation on Ethereum has now caught the attention of some traders: a classic inverse Head and Shoulders bottom. According to crypto expert Gert van Lagen, who shared his analysis on the social media platform X, this inverse head and shoulders is setting up on a long-term timeframe. Specifically, Ethereum's two-week candlestick chart, shared by the analyst, reveals a fully formed structure with a left shoulder in mid-2021, a pronounced head that took shape during the bear market in late 2022 to early 2023, and a right shoulder forming throughout the 2024 correction into early 2025. A confirmed breakout above this zone could activate the full bullish target projected by the technical formation. According to Gert van Lagen, the two-week head-and-shoulders pattern suggests Ethereum may be “closer to $20K than most anticipate.” His price target calculation follows a classic technical methodology. By measuring the vertical distance from the head's lowest point to the neckline resistance and then projecting that same distance upward from the neckline, he arrives at a target of approximately $19,500, which is more than a 600% gain from today's price levels. In the same analysis, van Lagen also highlighted a descending broadening wedge pattern that has been forming since mid-2023. This secondary structure reinforces the notion that Ethereum may embark on a significantly larger breakout once $4,200 is cleared. However, this projection of $19,500 is based on the technical symmetry of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, rather than fundamental shifts in Ethereum. Additionally, there is no clear timeline for this target; however, based on the multi-year nature of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, the price target may also take up to four years to materialize.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A more upbeat macroeconomic backdrop, growing corporate appetite for digital assets, and increased regulatory clarity will fuel a constructive outlook for crypto markets in the second half of 2025, according to a report by Coinbase Research. After a bumpy first quarter marked by a brief contraction in U.S. GDP and trade disruptions, data now point to stronger growth. The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker has jumped to 3.8% QoQ as of early June, a sharp upgrade from earlier in the year. This shift, alongside expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and a less aggressive trade policy, has eased recession fears and strengthened investor sentiment. Declining dollar dominance and inflation protection use-cases may also boost bitcoin's BTC$106,822.53 appeal, even if long-dated U.S. Treasury yields remain elevated, the report said. Altcoins may lag unless they benefit from specific catalysts, such as ETF approvals or protocol developments. Meanwhile, public companies are increasingly adding crypto to their balance sheets, aided by a 2024 rule change allowing "mark-to-market" accounting for digital assets. While this trend is expanding demand, it's also introducing new systemic risks. Firms that fund crypto buys with convertible debt may be forced to sell if refinancing options dry up or prices fall sharply. If passed, it could clarify rules for both issuers and investors. Some rulings could be made as early as July, and the rest are likely to be finalized by October. Tom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Let CFO.com's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. As regulators catch up to crypto, Berkon says trust and transparency are becoming competitive advantages. Irina Berkon, CFO of Metallicus, took the stage at Consensus 2025 in Toronto last month to deliver a message many financial executives have grown wary of: crypto and blockchain still matter. While AI dominates headlines and CFO inboxes alike, Berkon argued real progress is finally happening in crypto infrastructure and finance leaders should take note. Speaking from experience inside a company that builds blockchain solutions and uses them in day-to-day treasury management, she made a case for why this long-hyped technology is beginning to earn its place in the finance function. In a recent interview, Berkon explains how Metallicus uses blockchain for multi-layered control, how she approaches forecasting in a market still taking shape and why the post-hype era of crypto could offer more substance and security than ever before. She also shares her unique but telling journey into the industry and her thoughts on the future of accounting talent. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. IRINA BERKON: As a crypto company, we not only offer this type of service, but we use it ourselves. Just a few minutes before this call, we had a real example of how we use blockchain technology for treasury management and fund control. We manage various crypto wallets that hold our assets. That request was then routed to the designated signatories. Until it is fully approved, the funds remain locked — neither the initiator nor any single signer can move them alone. For me, the biggest benefit is the assurance that no single person can move assets independently. This not only enhances security but also prevents reconciliation issues. Ultimately, it's all about strong treasury and cash management. This will sound familiar to anyone who's dealt with layered approvals in traditional banking. When managing crypto in your treasury, the same level of oversight is essential. You need full visibility into where assets are going and who's authorized each transaction — whether it's the CFO or another member of the finance team. We talk and listen closely to our customers, who are primarily financial institutions — credit unions, community banks and similar organizations. From a revenue standpoint, our business model is very much like that of a typical B2B software company. I focus on what we're selling, how we're pricing it and how that translates into revenue. This not only enhances security but also prevents reconciliation issues." When it comes to the volatility of crypto, whether prices go up or down, we view it the same way any company would treat volatile assets on their balance sheet. We happen to hold more crypto than cash, largely because we are a crypto company. We believe in the technology, we understand it deeply and we're well-positioned to manage that exposure, perhaps more so than companies that don't actively manage crypto in their treasury. All investment decisions regarding cryptocurrency allocations are made jointly by our CEO Marshall Hayner and me, with guidance from our board. I don't think it was legitimate in the past. There was a lot of talk, a lot of hype, but not much real belief or action. We've been at this for a long time, having conversations with banks and regulators, trying to lay the groundwork. The opposite of what most people assume is true. Back then, no one was integrating crypto or blockchain into their financial institutions in a meaningful way. There was speculation, and a handful of companies tried to do it, but they didn't stick. There are a few reasons for that. That's giving financial institutions more confidence to explore this space seriously. And frankly, there's also been a shakeout. A lot of the companies that weren't serious or couldn't actually deliver are gone. So now, not only do banks and credit unions feel safer from a compliance standpoint, but they also have solid, credible partners they can work with. I was walking down the Embarcadero when a group of young entrepreneurs rode by on electric scooters. Then he asked, ‘Aren't you in finance?' And then, right there on the sidewalk, he said, ‘Do you want to be CFO of our company? We'd [previously] met briefly at a friend's house, and he remembered I had a finance background. They didn't need a traditional CFO; they needed someone who could help build from the ground up. It's not just about cool tech or internet culture anymore." After my talk, an auditor from BPM approached me and said they had a client in San Francisco — Metallicus — that needed a CFO to complete its audit. He said, ‘Because I want to get money transmitter licenses in all 50 states. I want to be a legit crypto company.' He started walking me through the compliance framework he was building, and I thought, ‘This is perfect.' After seeing so much chaos in the space, I wanted to work with someone serious about doing things the right way. That was January 2020, and I've been with Metallicus ever since. What's kept me here — and in this industry — is that it's finally moved beyond the hype. It's not just about cool tech or internet culture anymore. These are people with backgrounds in public accounting, regulation and financial operations. I think there's this expectation now that big opportunities will just fall into your lap. And in crypto, I've seen it firsthand, so many people with CFO titles who didn't actually know finance. They got the title, but then what? Firms absolutely should pay people well so they don't burn out or leave public accounting too early. But we also need to be clear: you're not going to land a serious CFO role — or any high-level finance job — without putting in the work. "More people are going to want to work in blockchain and AI, which is only going to deepen the talent shortage in traditional industries." That means learning the fundamentals, building relationships and showing up consistently. That foundation is what prepares you for the next step. When I was at Grant Thornton, we used to host industry conferences for restaurant clients. I remember being a fourth-year associate, sitting in a room with the CEO of Whole Foods and thinking, ‘How cool is this?' That kind of access sticks with you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has evolved from a niche asset to a mainstream institutional-grade investment, with Fortune 500 companies, like Strategy and GameStop among others, allocating billions to bitcoin holdings, transforming corporate treasuries into crypto-forward financial operations. Companies are leveraging complex financial instruments (e.g., convertible notes, structured products, bitcoin-backed loans) to gain crypto exposure, potentially blurring the line between financial innovation and speculative risk. The role of corporate treasurers is expanding beyond traditional finance to include crypto expertise, risk governance, and digital asset strategy, prompting a critical reevaluation of bitcoin's place on balance sheets — as a hedge, speculative asset, or branding signal — based on a company's unique financial profile. In the early days of bitcoin, it was hard to imagine Fortune 500 treasury teams doing anything more than monitoring its unpredictable price swings out of casual interest. Strategy has transformed itself into a bitcoin treasury company and is now primarily in the business of selling securities to raise money to buy the cryptocurrency. GameStop, for example, on Wednesday (June 11) announced it was issuing $1.75 billion in convertible notes to buy bitcoin. This followed an earlier Q1 acquisition of 4,710 BTC (about $513 million), which made GameStop the 13th‑largest corporate holder. Elsewhere, The Blockchain Group, which describes itself as Europe's first bitcoin treasury company, on Monday (June 9) announced a $300 million issuance for, you guessed it, the purposes of purchasing more bitcoin. From structured notes and hedging instruments to yield-bearing custodial accounts and even Bitcoin-backed loans, the ecosystem is diversifying at a pace few anticipated. But beneath the innovation lies a familiar tension: are these truly risk-managed tools for corporate finance, or cleverly packaged speculative bets in disguise? Read also: Making Sense of Bitcoin's Growing Relevance for Corporate Treasuries With regulatory clarity slowly improving, especially around custody and reporting standards, corporate finance professionals are being offered a potential new value proposition: the cryptocurrency not as a gamble, but as a balance sheet diversification strategy. As PYMNTS covered, even the Ivy-league institution Brown University has recently disclosed a $4.9 million investment in BlackRock's bitcoin ETF, signaling a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in diversified portfolios. After all, the CLARITY Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets and crypto markets in the U.S., is set to be considered by the full U.S. House of Representatives after being advanced by two House committees Tuesday (June 10). It's no longer merely about cash, FX, or interest rate swaps — but increasingly about whether the CFO team has the infrastructure, expertise, risk governance, and capital strategies to harness any crypto strategy judiciously. But behind the headlines and bold plays lies a complex ecosystem rich with financing engineering, volatility exposure, regulatory uncertainty, and governance pitfalls. After all, for all the innovation, there's a critical issue at the heart of this trend: are these financial tools being used to serve prudent corporate strategy, or are they a new flavor of speculative risk? Some critics argue that bitcoin-linked treasury products may be less about strategic diversification and more about corporate speculation dressed in financial engineering. But in doing so, they can sometimes introduce new forms of complexity — particularly around counterparty risk, liquidity constraints and regulatory uncertainty. The accounting treatment of crypto assets remains a thorny issue. In the U.S., bitcoin is still classified as an intangible asset, meaning unrealized losses must be recognized, but gains can't be booked unless the asset is sold. This creates a lopsided risk profile for public companies. Is it a modern hedge against fiat inflation, akin to gold? A speculative instrument that can juice short-term returns but introduces material downside? For a capital-intensive industrial company with tight liquidity, it may be an unjustifiable risk. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many people still don't see the point of using blockchain in games. It's a powerful tool that drives ownership and trading but is not vital for most gameplay types. Fast processors and cloud servers are not enough anymore. AI agents and players need blockchain to enable a truly social gaming experience, where achievements can be recorded and carried across different titles, turning games into connected social ecosystems. Without decentralized infrastructure, agentic gameplay risks becoming a centralized walled garden where progress is temporary, creations are locked in, and experience is limited. Today's AI can build a personalized game flow as it learns and adapts in real time. But when AI runs within a centralized entity, its creations remain disposable, owned and monetized by corporations. Memories and evolving character relationships die if the server shuts down. Game progress, AI agent evolution and generated content are tied to the lifecycle of a game session, account or corporate policy. If a player restarts the game or a publisher pulls the plug, all creations and achievements risk going in vain. When AI agents forget what they did yesterday, emerging storylines can't unfold consistently, and NPCs don't get smarter. They build new characters, stories and items, but gamers can't benefit from their own creations. Creativity gets exploited when players can't capitalize on their contributions. Blockchain is a natural fit to extend AI's memory and grant users ownership of their creations. A distributed ledger can record game contents onchain, including player actions and achievements. This opens the way to consistent narratives and character arcs. When AI's progress is recorded onchain, it is stored in users' wallets, so players own and control their history — it's not lost or locked away. It cannot be transferred to other games or platforms. Recent: Crypto gaming interest drops in April, overall ecosystem healthier: DappRadar When AI is backed by blockchain, any generated item can be minted as an NFT and stay in the player's wallet forever. Users can transfer their assets beyond a single title across virtual worlds. Players can compare what they've built, show off their achievements with AI, and appreciate others' journeys. Social dynamics evolve around provable creativity, history and shared experiences, not simply leaderboards or loot boxes. That keeps players coming back — not just playing, but connecting. Is it cost-efficient to store so much data onchain, though? Layer-2 and Layer-3 platforms have dramatically advanced over the past few years. They've become fast and cheap enough to handle thousands of transactions per second at a nearly invisible cost. Robust infrastructure has made it possible to store large amounts of data. When crafted carefully, they enhance the gameplay, not replace it, like in early play-to-earn products. AI agents will forge unique items and mint them as NFTs, giving rise to in-game marketplaces woven directly into gameplay. Agents will seek the best trades and autonomously execute them. Players will enjoy playing, skipping most of the technical friction. And when they can license, rent or sell them on open marketplaces, they gain a real sense of agency and reward, turning their contributions into lasting value. While players monetize what they create, game developers profit, too. They can earn a share of every marketplace transaction, charge fees for minting or customization, and offer premium AI tools to creators. This approach goes beyond one-and-done sales: Devs earn as players create, trade and grow. Embracing public ledgers is a broad trend: Large enterprises and banks increasingly rely on decentralized infrastructure. It is critical to support agentic AI-driven entertainment through memory, ownership and monetization to make it a true social experience. Without Web3, next-gen games risk staying just a demo version of what they really can be.

In spite of great fintech advances, conventional payment systems are still inefficient. Although originally designed as a platform to support decentralized cryptocurrencies, blockchain is emerging as a dynamic tool that can be used to greatly improve B2B cross-border payments. It can significantly reduce transaction costs and dependency on intermediary banks, as well as increase speed and security by promoting direct peer-to-peer transactions on a protected distributed ledger. Within B2B cross-border payments, blockchain can act as a decentralized payment rail. With automated compliance checks through the use of smart contracts and custom transaction tracking, it can enable businesses to perform transfers directly across borders in minutes. As blockchain-based payment systems become adopted by fintech companies, the industry is currently at a turning point. Global B2B payments are still processed through an older, dated infrastructure despite improvements within fintech. Most companies are researching B2B payment solutions to streamline costs and speed up transactions. International remittance complexities typically affect many intermediary banks, each charging its own processing fees. Foreign exchange (FX) markups by banks and financial institutions also add additional fees to transactions. The SWIFT network, utilized by over 11,000 institutions, has several steps, each with failure points and delays. This inefficiency creates cash flow issues and increases counterparty risks for international companies. Many standard B2B payments are based on unseen banking processes without real-time tracking. Consumer payments benefit from innovations like real-time payment networks, but cross-border business transactions still rely on traditional systems.

Sanctions violations must be screened through transactions by financial institutions, which is time-consuming. Blockchain technology can combat these challenges within B2B payments by offering decentralized, transparent, and efficient payment systems. In contrast to SWIFT-based transfers where both parties are served a portion of the transaction fee, blockchain transactions take place over a P2P (peer-to-peer) network that minimizes cost significantly. Some blockchain networks have incorporated compliance-friendly frameworks to make regulatory adoption easier. Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly used in blockchain payments to provide greater anti-fraud capability and regulatory reporting. AI improves payment automation through cash management optimization, predicting delays, and automating transactional flows reconciliation.

Financial institutions are realizing the potential of how blockchain technology can improve payment systems. The advances align with a trend of mainstream financial institutions embracing blockchain technology in business with the objective of improving efficiency, security, and transparency for B2B payments. CBDCs could bypass intermediaries in payments to reduce expenses and enhance speed. Projects like mBridge are a central bank initiative that aims to enable instant, peer-to-peer cross-border payments in the form of CBDCs. Meanwhile, solutions for seamless payments across different platforms are being designed by companies like Visa. For instance, cross-chain interoperability solutions which allows CBDCs to work with Real-Time Payments (RTP) systems. All these developments are leading us to wider blockchain adoption in traditional finance. As B2B payments shift more toward blockchain, regulators are syncing the compliance frameworks.

Policymakers are also seeking frameworks to bring CBDCs, stablecoins, and blockchain payments under a common legal framework.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal are demanding answers from Meta about potential plans to re-enter stablecoins — as a new bill heads for Senate vote that could give Meta political cover to launch a digital currency. Two of the Senate's fiercest tech watchdogs are demanding answers from Mark Zuckerberg — again. But this time, it's not about privacy breaches or content moderation. In a direct letter to Zuckerberg, Warren and Blumenthal asked if Meta had consulted with lawmakers or lobbyists while the stablecoin bill was being drafted. They also want to know if Meta has plans to issue its own token — a move that would mark a resurrection of its long-abandoned Diem project. That the GENIUS Act, even before being signed into law, could be shaped in ways favorable to Big Tech. Especially if Trump's expected waivers give Meta a greenlight other stablecoin issuers won't get. But that's not enough to silence lawmakers, especially given the company's track record. “Facebook's Diem project didn't die on technical grounds,” one Hill insider noted. “It was smothered politically because nobody wanted Zuckerberg in control of a global payments rail.” They warned that if Meta controls a stablecoin again, the data it collects from billions of users across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger could be weaponized into surveillance capitalism — turbocharged. If passed, the bill would allow the President to grant certain waivers to stablecoin issuers — waivers that could exempt platforms like Meta from regulatory constraints. Warren's office said: “This sets a dangerous precedent where political influence, not public interest, dictates who gets to issue digital money.” This comes as Trump is reportedly backing World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform with ties to his inner circle. Billions of users, integrated messaging apps, and massive financial reach make Meta a top contender to dominate retail stablecoin usage overnight — if allowed. If Meta leans on existing tokens like USDC or USDT, that could accelerate stablecoin adoption but concentrate power in unsettling ways. This overwhelming optimism stems from 46 analyst ratings collected over the past three months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GameStop (GME) stock plummeted nearly 25% Thursday after the video game seller announced that it intends to sell $1.75 billion worth of convertible bonds. Investors will convert the notes into GameStop equity before or when they mature in 2032, diluting shares and potentially weighing on the stock's value. In May, the company announced a $500 million purchase of bitcoin. Thursday's announcement follows another big debt offering, with the company selling $1.3 billion of convertible bonds in March. Smaller, low-growth companies such as GameStop have been following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor's software firm, Strategy (MSTR), using a combination of debt and equity to add bitcoin to their balance sheet in the hopes of replicating its stock price success. But investors are wary of such bets because bitcoin can be volatile. "The main risk in running a leveraged 'bitcoin treasury' strategy is that a rapid drop in the price of bitcoin would lead to a possibility of bankruptcy," NYU Stern School of Business professor David Yermack told Yahoo Finance earlier this month. GameStop's revenue has fallen every year since 2023 as video gamers opt for digital game purchases rather than visiting its stores. Read more about GameStop's stock moves and today's market action.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In reality, it could enable corruption, screw over taxpayers, and potentially destabilize the economy. The GENIUS Act would allow banks and private companies to issue stablecoins, essentially their own currencies, with light oversight from regulators. It mandates that issuers of stablecoins hold a reserve of the stable asset backing their cryptocurrency at all times, and that firms abide by certain anti-money laundering laws, as well as U.S. sanctions against foreign entities. It sounds like a step in the right direction, but this piece of legislation is working its way through Congress as sitting President Donald Trump and his family build a cryptocurrency empire that steamrolls anti-corruption laws and ethical norms — one they hope will flourish under the industry-friendly policies and laws created by the administration of the Trump patriarch. A 2023 study published by the Bank for International Settlements found that of 60 stablecoins analyzed in their review, all of them had become de-pegged from their underlying asset at least once. FTX crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison after carrying out one of the largest financial scams since Enron. Trump pledged a new, friendlier regulatory environment in Washington — and the crypto industry poured many millions into Super PACs to elect allies throughout Congress. ), who told Rolling Stone ahead of key votes that the bill would “create a superhighway for Donald Trump's corruption.” The Trump family's cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial — which is currently being operated by his sons and Zach Witkoff, the son of Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff — recently launched its own stablecoin, designated USD1, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by treasury bonds. The GENIUS Act would allow major tech companies, banks, and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, and many are poised to buy Treasury bonds so they can back the digital currency with real assets, as is required. According to a report issued last week by ARK Invest, the stablecoin market may become one of the largest holders of U.S. debt in the coming years — potentially tying large swaths of U.S. debt to a dubiously regulated and often unstable asset. ‘No Fat Soldiers': Ft. Bragg Troops Were Carefully Screened for Trump's Stunt Visit Los Angeles ICE Raids Are Driving Immigrants — And Citizens — Underground The lines grow even murkier when considering Trump's habit of using his position in the White House to enrich himself, as well as to tip market scales. World Liberty Financial already landed a $2 billion transaction deal to help an Abu Dhabi-state backed company purchase a stake in the Binance crypto exchange using the USD1 stablecoin. “As soon as the players understand that Trump's intervention is a real possibility, then the stablecoin market is no longer about a careful review of whether there are adequate dollars to back up a particular stablecoin, or whether the stable coin issuer has an AAA rating,” Warren says. They wrote the regulation, and Congress — not knowing much about that world — passed it.” The consequence was, in Warren's view, that lay people believed the industry to be effectively regulated, when in reality investors essentially tailored legislation to their own priorities. “So think about why an industry comes to Congress and says, ‘Regulate us.' Last week, Hawley described the GENIUS Act as a “huge giveaway to Big Tech” that would effectively allow private tech companies to create their own currencies that compete with the dollar. “The United States does not gain from creating a competing electronic currency. Getting more people to hold stable coins rather than dollars during their investment transactions, does not serve us interests, but it injects risk into the U.S.” “Anyone who thinks that when a financial crash hits [the value of stablecoins] will translate one to one into dollars is fooling themselves,” she adds. The ripple effects can be catastrophic when a stablecoin collapses. Existing stablecoins are already buying up billions in Treasury bonds, and in the event of a run on a coin, or any type of collapse within stablecoin, the issuer would sell off their own holdings — in this case Treasury bonds — to pay back their customers. PayPal has already launched its own cryptocurrency, and Apple, Facebook, X, and Airbnb have all explored releasing their own stablecoins for customers to conduct on-platform transactions in crypto. “This GENIUS Act, for the first time, destroys that wall.” Seemingly secure, lucrative schemes have left the U.S. and global economy in ruins. ‘No Fat Soldiers': Ft. Bragg Troops Were Carefully Screened for Trump's Stunt Visit Brian Wilson, Beach Boys Co-Founder and Architect of Pop, Dead at 82 Essentially, as Georgetown Law professor Adam Levitin wrote last month, “Congress is about to put the claims of stablecoin investors ahead of ma and pa's bank deposits.” Because most standard bank deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the result is that depositors' checking and savings would be used to pay off lost crypto holdings and everyone else can file for an insurance claim.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) failed to hold above $110,000 following the sentiment-fuelled rally earlier this week, which broadly lifted cryptocurrency prices. Major altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), which had previously offered bullish signals alongside BTC, are now starting to show weakness amid swelling bearish biases. Key attributes for this lackluster price action have primarily been the lack of risk appetite, as sentiment remains strikingly cautious, as per the K33 Research “Ahead of the Curve” report released on Tuesday. Data spotlight: BTC and ETH spot ETF inflows charge as prices falter This has positively influenced spot Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs) inflows despite waning retail interest. According to SoSoValue, BTC spot ETFs saw approximately $165 million daily total net inflows on Wednesday, significantly below Tuesday's volume of $431 million. Institutional interest in Ethereum has steadied since mid-May, with ETH spot ETFs posting 17 consecutive days of inflows. Bitcoin hovered near all-time highs of $111,980 earlier this week, but market sentiment remained alarmingly cautious, possibly due to uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. “Funding rates and leverage indicators across platforms point to sustained defensiveness, with Binance's BTC/USDT perpetuals averaging negative daily funding on Friday and Sunday,” a K33 Research analyst said in the report. CoinGlass data, as shown in the chart below, indicates that the OI is near $74 billion, down from approximately $80 billion as of May 23. A low or declining OI indicates that interest among traders is decreasing, and if coupled with softer trading volumes, it could hinder the price from edging higher. Traders would look for a confirmation of a sell signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator to ascertain the bearish momentum. Crypto investor and analyst Michaël van de Poppe said via an X post that since Bitcoin's price failed to gain strength above $110,000, a correction is expected. Although the RSI holds sideways at 56, it has retreated from overbought levels, signaling that bulls may give up. A break above this level would encounter the 200-period EMA resistance at $2.26. Areas such as $2.19, 2% below the current price, and $2.07, which holds 7% under the prevailing market level, stand out as key downside targets for XRP. The cross-border money remittance token upside remains strongly limited despite surging institutional interest and adoption. When Open Interest decreases, it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market, investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors. Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An increasing number of blockchains is actively seeking to integrate AI capabilities, but this “AI on blockchain” growth is accompanied by significant challenges, most notably the issue of "chain silos", which fragment the sector and can hold back the full realization and utility of Decentralized AI (DeAI) potential. Take blockchain-native autonomous AI agents as an example, while a precise census of AI agents on the blockchain is elusive, the available data strongly suggests a rapidly growing and dynamic landscape. While centralized AI suffers from data silos controlled by corporations, DeAI risks creating new silos at the blockchain level if interoperability is not prioritized, blocking DeAI's full potential. It extends to the unique protocols, smart contract languages, virtual machine environments, consensus mechanisms, and overall operational logic of each distinct blockchain. Similarly, AI agents trained within one chain's environment may find it difficult to operate effectively elsewhere. This leads to scenarios where separate databases or non-communicating tools on different chains effectively become isolated islands of DeAI activity. Fragmentation issues, similar to those seen in decentralized identity systems or healthcare electronic health records due to platform incompatibilities, can limit the scalability and impact of DeAI solutions. Building "Super AI Applications" is becoming a key mission for many. Imagine it as an all-encompassing platform or a network of integrated services that accommodates diverse AI functionalities – such as sophisticated data analysis, distributed model training, autonomous agent deployment, and complex decision making – across different, often varied and disparate blockchain environments. Such an application would not be confined to the resources or limitations of a single chain. On one hand, specialized Layer 1 blockchains like Bittensor, and Gensyn are being engineered from the ground up with DeAI specific requirements in mind. These platforms aim to provide optimized environments for tasks like high-volume data processing, intensive computation, or unique AI model incentive mechanisms, based on the premise that general-purpose L1s may not be ideally suited for the distinct demands of DeAI. Inevitably, successful DeAI platforms will increasingly rely on reliable and functional cross-chain capabilities to access wider markets, liquidity, and data sources, regardless of their foundational architecture, thereby avoiding the very “silo-zation” they aim to overcome. Realizing the Super AI APP vision is charged with significant challenges though. Despite these challenges, industry players are proactively exploring solutions and standardization for DeAI Super Applications to cross chain, including leaders like BSC and Solana, although this is still at an infant stage. In the meantime, innovations in protocols, platforms, and conceptual frameworks are also taking shape to construct a more interconnected DeAI ecosystem which can potentially become real utility for even novice internet users. This trend is inevitable, driven by the enormous potential underneath AI and blockchain's synergistic benefits.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Privy, established just over three years ago, offers a single API solution that enables developers to create products utilising cryptocurrency technology. Payments firm Stripe has reached an agreement to acquire the crypto wallet infrastructure startup Privy, marking a significant step in its renewed focus on cryptocurrency following a six-year break. This acquisition follows Stripe's recent $1.1bn purchase of stablecoin platform Bridge, furthering its strategic expansion into the digital currency sector. Privy, founded slightly over three years ago, has developed a single API solution that facilitates developers in creating products using crypto technology. The company claims to support over 75 million accounts across more than 1,000 developer teams, handling billions in transactions for clients such as trading platform Hyperliquid and restaurant app Blackbird. Together, we can change how value moves through the Internet.” It is anticipated that Privy's technology will be leveraged by Stripe to integrate new capabilities for its customers, enhancing user experience and potentially driving further adoption of digital assets.
