                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge has ruled that the government can no longer hold pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil under Secretary of State Marco Rubio's claims that he poses a threat to national security. U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz blocked the government from deporting Khalil and ordered him to be released on Friday, but gave the government time to appeal his release. In his decision, Farbiarz wrote that Khalil will continue to suffer irreparable harm if he continues to be detained, having already lost a job offer from Oxfam International and been blocked from witnessing the birth of his firstborn child. “This vindicates what Mahmoud has maintained since day one — that the government cannot detain or deport him based on Rubio's say-so,” said Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer for Khalil, in a statement. “ICE should now do the right thing and release Mahmoud immediately so he can return to his wife, Noor, and their newborn baby boy, Deen.” “This is the news we've been waiting over three months for,” said Abdalla. “True justice would mean Mahmoud was never taken away from us in the first place, that no Palestinian father, from New York to Gaza, would have to endure the painful separation of prison walls like Mahmoud has. I will not rest until Mahmoud is free, and hope that he can be with us to experience his first Father's Day at home in New York with Deen in his arms.” “Today's ruling delays justice and seeks to undermine the President's constitutionally vested powers under Article II,” said DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. Farbiarz wrote that the government could still make an argument that Khalil failed to fill out his green card application correctly — even though the government itself seems to have overstepped numerous statutory authorities in order to arrest and detain Khalil.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A unique Le Birkin handbag, the only one of its kind made for the British-born singer and actor Jane Birkin, is to go on sale in Paris. The prototype model of the iconic Hermès bag, which Birkin used for nine years, is expected to fetch a six-figure sum at auction next month. The head of handbags and fashion at Sotheby's, Aurélie Vassy, said it was unique. “It was the first bag given to Jane Birkin and it's obvious that she made remarks and suggestions about the prototype. There is no other bag like it in the world.” The creation of Le Birkin is a fashion legend that came about after Birkin's chance encounter with the head of the French luxury goods company, Jean-Louis Dumas, on a commercial flight from Paris to London in 1984. In a 2018 interview with CBS, Birkin, who died in July 2023, said: “I found myself next door to a very polite gentleman and I had my agenda as usual banged full of bits of paper and everything and the whole thing fell to the ground. “So I picked it up and he said: ‘You should have pockets in that agenda'. It was auctioned again in 2000 and bought by the current owner, a collector of luxury goods, who has declined to say how much she paid for it. Style, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solved Hermès gave her four more, but in a 2012 interview she described it as the “bloody Birkin bag”, complaining they were heavy and “snobbish”. Three years later, she asked Hermès to rename a crocodile-skin version because of concerns about the treatment of the animals used to produce it. The prototype is a different size to later models, has a shoulder strap and brass hardware, later replaced with gold-plate rings, clasps and “feet”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Deadly crash: At least 290 people are dead after a passenger plane crashed on departure at an airport in Ahmedabad, India, authorities told Reuters. • At least one survivor: There were 242 people aboard the Air India flight, which was en route to London, the airline said. At least one passenger survived the crash, local police said. • Safety record: Air India has seen a few rare but high-profile plane crashes through the years. Previous accidents have spurred Indian authorities to improve its safety and infrastructure, but challenges remain. US President Donald Trump expressed concern about the fatal plane crash in India on Thursday and said he has pledged US support if needed in its aftermath. A Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner plane en route to London crashed on departure at an airport in India's western city of Ahmedabad, with more than 200 people feared dead. I've already told them, anything we can do — it's a big country, a strong country, they'll handle it — I'm sure. But it was a horrific crash,” Trump told reporters at the White House. At least 290 people have died after an Air India plane crashed shortly after take off from Ahmedabad airport in India on Thursday, Reuters reported, citing local officials. This includes some students as the plane crashed on the building where they were staying,” Vidhi Chaudhary, a top state police officer, told Reuters. At least one passenger on board Air India Flight 171 to London Gatwick survived, local police said. According to Reuters, senior police officer Vidhi Chaudhary said the man had been in seat 11A and added that there may be a few more survivors in the hospital. What appears to be a copy of the flight manifest, shared by news agency IANS, lists Vishwash Kumar Ramesh as having been assigned seat 11A and boarded. The Hindustan Times said it spoke to Ramesh in a local hospital, and quoted him as saying: “Thirty seconds after takeoff, there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed. Ramesh  told the Hindustan Times that he had been visiting family and was returning to the UK with his brother, who had been sitting in a different row. An Air India flight en route to London carrying 242 passengers and crew crashed shortly after taking off from the western city of Ahmedabad in India's Guajarat state earlier today. Here's what we know so far about the crash: Timeline: According to aviation tracker Flightradar24, Air India Flight 171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, departed from Ahmedabad International airport at 1:38 p.m. local time (4:08 a.m. ET) with a destination of London Gatwick Airport. The aircraft's signal was lost less than a minute later, at an altitude of 625 feet. Social media video shows flames and thick smoke billowing into the air, as an Air India passenger plane, carrying 242 people, crashed shortly after takeoff. Casualties: Air India's CEO Campbell Wilson said in a social media video message today that injured passengers were taken to a local hospitals and a “special team of caregivers from Air India is on their way to Ahmedabad to provide additional support.” More than 200 people are feared dead, but the number of casualties is not immediately clear. Ahmedabad's police commissioner told The Associated Press earlier that it appeared there are no survivors. Some residents and their relatives are said to be missing, while one resident's wife has been found dead, according to a statement from the group. The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it will be leading a team that is heading to India to assist local authorities' probe into the crash. “Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected,” it added in an X post. Support for victims: Tata Group, the owner of Air India and one of India's largest conglomerates, has said it will provide ₹1 crore ($116,868) to the families of each person who has lost their life, the company announced in a post on X. “We will also cover the medical expenses of those injured and ensure that they receive all necessary care and support,” it added. Some background: Air India was bought by Indian multinational conglomerate Tata Group in 2022, and was widely regarded as a historic homecoming. Tata in 1932 before being nationalized in 1953, the deal marked the return of Air India to its original owners after nearly 70 years of government control. The Federation of All India Medical Association said between 50 and 60 students have been admitted to local hospitals after an Air India flight crashed into the hostel at the BJ Medical College and Hospital. Injured passengers found at the crash site were taken to local hospitals in Ahemdabad, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson said in a social media video message. “Injured passengers have been taken by local authorities to the nearest hospitals. We are actively working with authorities on all emergency response efforts,” Wilson said. “A special team of caregivers from Air India is on their way to Ahmedabad to provide additional support,” he added. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has formally offered its assistance to India's authorities following the crash of Air India Flight AI171. “This is in accordance with ICAO [International Civil Aviation Organization] Annex 13 because UK citizens were on board the aircraft.” “Our thoughts are with all those affected by this tragic accident,” the agency added. Annex 13 outlines how accident investigation participation is determined. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it will be leading a team of US investigators who are heading to India to assist local authorities' probe into the crash of a Boeing passenger plane, according to a NTSB statement posted on X. ICAO references 19 technical annexes to maintain uniformity in international civil aviation, and annex 13 outlines how accident investigation participation is determined. The same protocol was followed after last year's deadly Jeju Air flight 2216 crash in South Korea. In a post on X, acting Federal Aviation Administration  Administrator Chris Rocheleau said the agency is “deeply saddened” by the crash and “is actively working with the NTSB and stands ready to support our international partners during this difficult time.” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he's “devastated” to learn about the Air India crash in Ahmedabad. One Canadian national was on the flight, Carney said. “Canada's transportation officials are in close contact with counterparts and I am receiving regular updates as the response to this tragedy unfolds,” he said in a post on X. Video shared to social media video shows flames and thick smoke billowing into the air as the Air India passenger plane crashed shortly after takeoff. Today's crash of an Air India flight on a Boeing 787-8 airplane is the latest in a string of safety incidents over the years for plane manufacturer Boeing Co. Investigators are set to have a meeting later this month on the incident. And at the tailend of 2024, Boeing saw another devastating incident. Boeing's 787-8 Dreamliner — the type of plane involved in today's crash, according to data from Flightradar24 — hasn't seen crashes at this magnitude in its history, however, there have been other incidents. This year, four passengers and two crew members were injured on a United Airlines flight that made a sudden jolt in the air. Boeing has also felt the financial burden of its many problems. At the start of 2025, the company had lost $39.3 billion since early 2019 and reported losses in virtually every quarter since then. “Our special prayers and deepest possible sympathy are with the families and friends of all those affected by this appallingly tragic incident across so many nations, as they await news of their loved ones,” the King said in a message posted to the Royal Family's official X account. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says it is in contact with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) regarding Air India flight AI171. It added: “We stand ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB.” Boeing has issued a new statement about the Air India crash, saying it is in contact with the airline and stands “ready to support them.” “Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected,” it added in an X post. A reception center for relatives of passengers on board the Air India Flight 171 has been established at London's Gatwick Airport. The center will provide information and support to relatives of victims. “British nationals who require consular assistance or have concerns about friends or family should call 020 7008 5000,” the airport shared on social media. According to data from the British government, in 2021, 1.9 million people — or 3.1% of the country's population — identified as having Indian ethnicity. “It appears there are no survivors in the plane crash,” Commissioner G.S. “Exact figures on casualties are being ascertained,” he said. Video shared on social media from the scene shows witnesses rushing to an enormous black plume of smoke as it rises up above the sky. Ahmedabad Airport has resumed operations with limited flights, it said in a post on X. It added that passengers are advised to contact their respective airlines for the latest flight schedule.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Newsom, California's governor, has called Donald Trump a “stone cold liar”, condemned the federal deployment of troops in Los Angeles as “theater” and “madness” and even questioned the president's mental fitness, as protests over immigration raids in the city continue. It followed the outbreak of protests over a series of sweeping immigration raids in the LA area, with Newsom criticizing Trump's actions as illegal overreach, unconstitutional and “provocation”. Now US marines are being added to this force to back up arrests by the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency, in tactics Newsom said have been used to “disappear” people unlawfully in these raids rather than confront the protesters who have destroyed property around an Ice facility in downtown Los Angeles. The federalized national guard have been taken from their duties on the border and working in California's forests to clear undergrowth to prevent wildfires and have had to be protected by police as protesters were specifically angry at them being deployed by the president, Newsom said. “This sends fear and chills up the spines of law-abiding citizens,” said Newsom, who has warned that other states and US democracy itself is under threat from the presidential overreach. Newsom told local media that Trump's age seemed to be affecting him. He claimed to the Times that the president can't recall the phone conversation they had on Friday and that “he's not all there”, echoing comments first made by the governor on Monday that Trump, who turns 79 on Saturday, is “incapable of even a train of thought” and that he has “lost it”. Trump has said that he wants to “liberate” Los Angeles from protesters and has escalated a feud with Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2028, by even suggesting the governor himself could be arrested. Los Angeles was calmer on Wednesday evening than at the weekend and the city's mayor, Karen Bass, has emphasized in local appearances how small an area has been affected by any trouble, with a limited area under curfew and no looting experienced there overnight into Thursday. However, as protests continue, several hundred further arrests were made late on Wednesday. Newsom also said in the interview broadcast, published on Thursday, that his 15-year-old daughter came home from school crying at the prospect of him being arrested. Meanwhile immigration “enforcement activity” has extended to California's agricultural heartland, where many farm workers are undocumented people. Los Angeles area mayors on Wednesday called on the Trump administration with withdraw troops and stop the raids that have caused widespread fear in immigrant communities. “I'm asking you, please listen to me, stop terrorizing our residents,” said Jessica Ancona, the mayor of El Monte, who said she was struck by rubber bullets during a recent raid in the city. And Trump said that the actions in Los Angeles were necessary. “If I didn't act quickly on that, Los Angeles would be burning to the ground right now,” Trump said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When did the act of public protest — a right protected by the First Amendment — become an act of “rebellion” eliciting a military response? What began as a fairly small protest against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at an apparel manufacturer in the Fashion District in downtown Los Angeles on June 6, led to an immediate response by federal agents in riot gear using pepper spray and “nonlethal bullets” to clear a path for vans to leave with detainees. This response in turn led to a larger mobilization that evening at the Los Angeles Federal Building downtown, demanding an end to all ICE raids in the city. This coordinated repression did not come from nowhere. While the Trump administration planned this move for about a year, the deployment of troops in Los Angeles is the brutal culmination of a yearslong campaign to systematically erode and circumscribe public assembly rights, enabled by both Democrats and Republicans at all levels of government. This war on dissent is the most visible sign of democratic backsliding in the U.S. By using the National Guard to silence dissent in Los Angeles, the Trump administration is eroding a core pillar of democracy: the right to assemble in public to express opinions contrary to government action and to advocate for change. During the civil rights movement, in which police faced strong backlash when they clashed violently with activists, U.S. police forces developed a new approach to public order policing called “negotiated management” in the 1980 and 1990s. Under negotiated management, police tried to respect the right of public assembly during large-scale public demonstrations to minimize clashes between protesters and police. However, in response to the anti-globalization protests at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, during which organizers refused to meet with police, police shifted to a new set of tactics called “strategic incapacitation” that would provide them with more control. This harsher and more repressive model aims to prevent protesters from engaging in serious public disruption (such as stopping traffic) by carefully containing protests — and in some cases, using aggressive tactics, such as penning protesters, mass arrests, and dispersal of protests through “nonlethal” chemical agents and rubber bullets to prevent large-scale protests from even taking place. Strategic incapacitation was presented as a combination of technologically advanced and “humane” tactics, given police use of “nonlethal” tools. But in fact, Anna Feigenbaum at University of Glasgow and author of Tear Gas, told Truthout: “Tear gas is promoted as a ‘nonlethal' form of crowd control, but in fact often causes harm, including serious injuries and even deaths. As a result, police combine these new tactics with advances in technology to disrupt protests through surveillance and even pre-emptive arrests. However, the events in Los Angeles appear to be moving beyond the control, surveillance, and use of technology that makes up strategic incapacitation. Reflecting on the current situation, Daniel Edler, research associate at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, told Truthout: “For me, what's happening in LA is nothing like that. Maybe the LAPD tried to apply strategic incapacitation, but if so, it clearly failed. This trend toward a newer and more repressive form of public order policing is not solely a Trump innovation. The right-wing lobbying group ALEC has spent the last decade encouraging state legislatures to rewrite anti-riot laws so that common nonviolent protest tactics, such as blocking roads and locking oneself onto fixed objects, are classified as acts of rioting, and can lead to felony charges. Trump administration has been testing the legal and political limits of its capacity to use the state to crush political opposition. With that precedent in place, the administration is now escalating this repression. Rhetorically, politicians try to equate traditional nonviolent protest tactics with actions by lawless mobs. During the campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza in the spring of 2024, President Joe Biden condemned student protesters and justified their repression by arguing that they were not “peaceful” — despite minimal accounts of physical violence by protesters, and negligible accounts of property damage. While classic proponents of nonviolent civil disobedience, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Mohandas Gandhi, have preached the need for nonviolent direct action, they also understood that protest required activists to disturb the peace, to stage a confrontation, in order to make an injustice manifest, and pressure authorities to change course. Since returning to office in January, the Trump administration has progressively ramped up its tools for silencing dissent. One of its very first targets were international students on U.S. college campuses who had participated in protests against the war in Gaza. ICE arrested these protesters, often without due process, as a means to both target universities that the Trump administration perceived as political enemies, and with an eye toward removing potential leaders of an opposition movement from the U.S. Again, this repeats the pattern of “strategic incapacitation,” whereby police target leaders of protest movements to prevent future demonstrations from taking place. With that precedent in place, the administration is now escalating this repression. The tactics used against foreign students are now being directed towards another vulnerable group: undocumented migrants, and their political supporters. By beginning with vulnerable groups who have less legal standing and social capital to resist repression, the Trump administration is making a strategic choice, hoping to provoke less public outcry and then use these precedents of repression later against a broader population. This is a textbook example of democratic backsliding, similar to what we have witnessed in countries, such as Poland and Hungary, in recent years. The Trump administration has shifted from bureaucratic threats to armed suppression of political opponents. This is dangerous for three reasons: First, the right to protest is not a favor granted by the state; it is a basic right to check the state's power. When government represses expressions of dissent via the National Guard, the government is signaling that it is no longer accountable to the people, and that it is willing to counter dissent with force. Second, these moves use fear to demobilize opposition. Democracy is eroded not through a violent explosion, but through the quiet (and often rational) decision by millions of citizens to stay home. Third, repressing dissent in this way breaks a basic democratic feedback loop. It is a real-time barometer of public discontent that holds governments to account between infrequent elections. To crush dissent in this way, the Trump administration (already historically unpopular in public opinion polling) is signaling that it has no interest in listening to dissenting opinions, but only to stamp dissent out. The Trump administration has shifted from bureaucratic threats to armed suppression of political opponents. This is no time to stay at home. We must take to the streets and demand that elected officials at every level of government condemn the use of military and police force against protesters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company is proposing to buy back its affiliate, Telus Digital.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press Telus Inc. T-T is proposing a more than US$400-million deal to take back control of its affiliate, Telus Digital TIXT-T, which has seen its share price plummet since it went public, locking in major losses as the company considers future spinout plans. Telus has signed a non-binding indication of interest to acquire all outstanding shares of Telus Digital, which offers technology outsourcing, for US$3.40 for multiple and subordinate shares, the company said in a release Thursday morning. Shares of Telus Digital on the New York Stock Exchange were up 26 per cent in morning trading, to US$3.73. Telus Digital's share price debuted at US$25 following its initial public offer in 2021, but has since declined by more than 90 per cent following industry-wide pressures on customer service businesses and the loss of major clients such as Meta Inc. The proposed acquisition represents a new cost for Telus, as it aims to pay down its nearly $25-billion in long-term debt, and looks to capitalize on its other business lines. It is possible a sweetener could be required to get this over the finish line, but we also have many investors in TIXT that would likely be happy to move on and see positively, the immediate benefit of a quick liquidity event,” Mr. Yaghi said. However, Telus Digital still owes its parent company cash, meaning that Telus's net disbursements could be half of that amount after netting out the debt. The company said that any financing that it undertakes in the near term will be designed to be neutral to its balance sheet net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, as it maintains focus on deleveraging. Richard Tse, analyst for the National Bank of Canada, said the deal values Telus Digital at about US$2.3-billion, calling that a reasonable valuation when compared to peers. Tyler Tebbs, head of research company Tebbs Capital, said that the proposal likely leaves Telus ahead financially, given that it raised over a billion dollars during the 2021 IPO, offloaded some financial risk and is now buying back the company at a steep discount. While it leaves Telus's reputation among investors with “a little bit of a black eye,” he said, the onus should be on shareholders who bought in at high prices to understand the risks inherent to the customer experience sector. The public listing of Telus Digital was celebrated as the first step in chief executive officer Darren Entwistle's ambitions to spin off two other business lines, Telus Health and Telus Agriculture and Consumer Goods. Some analysts have previously said that Telus Digital's poor stock performance could have a dampening effect on investor appetite for the possible monetization of those assets, which Telus has said could come in the form of either the addition of a strategic partner or a public listing. Meanwhile, Mr. Yaghi saw the proposal as a positive step ahead of any such monetization. “While it is too early to know if this deal will go through or not, putting this whole issue with TIXT behind it would be a good thing for TELUS as it gears towards a possible liquidity event for its Healthcare business possibly in 2026-2027,” he said. Barclays is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Telus, and Stikeman Elliott LLP and A&O Shearman are acting as legal advisors. But of those, half have since been taken private again, often at below-IPO prices, and many of the other half have considered doing so.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 290 people were killed when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed minutes after taking off from the western city of Ahmedabad on Thursday, authorities said, in the world's worst aviation disaster in a decade. At least one passenger is known to have survived, police said, and the man told Indian media how he had heard a loud noise shortly after take-off. Mississauga dentist was aboard Air India flight that crashed after take-off, family says This includes some students as the plane crashed on the building where they were staying,” Vidhi Chaudhary, a top state police officer, told Reuters. She said police found one survivor who was in seat 11A, next to an emergency exit, adding that there could be more survivors in hospital. “Thirty seconds after take-off, there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed,” 40-year-old Ramesh Viswashkumar told the Hindustan Times, which showed a boarding pass for seat 11A in that name online. “It all happened so quickly,” he told the paper from his hospital bed. “When I got up, there were bodies all around me. There were pieces of the plane all around me,” he said. He said that his brother Ajay was seated in a different row on the plane. “He was travelling with me and I can't find him any more. An Air India passenger plane with over 240 people onboard has crashed Thursday in India's northwestern city of Ahmedabad, according to the airline and local media. The passengers included 217 adults, 11 children and two infants a source told Reuters. The plane that crashed on Thursday flew for the first time in 2013 and was delivered to Air India in January, 2014, Flightradar24 said. Explainer: What we know about the Boeing 787 Dreamliner that crashed in India, killing more than 290 Thursday's crash occurred just after the plane took off. The crash of an Air India plane in Ahmedabad on Thursday set buildings on fire and left its tail section wedged into a structure. More than 200 people were killed when the plane heading to London crashed after taking off. “My son is safe, and I have spoken to him. It gave a “Mayday” call, signalling an emergency, but thereafter there was no response from the aircraft. U.S. aerospace safety consultant Anthony Brickhouse said one problematic sign from videos of the aircraft was that the landing gear was down at a phase of flight when it would typically be up. “If you didn't know what was happening, you would think that plane was on approach to a runway,” Brickhouse said. Graphic content: Video shows the Air India plane crash and resulting fireball in Ahmedabad on Thursday. Boeing said it was in contact with Air India and working to gather more information. Boeing shares fell 5 per cent as the crash posed a major setback for the planemaker as its new CEO looks to rebuild trust following a series of safety and production challenges. Aircraft engine-maker GE Aerospace said that it would put a team together to go to India and analyze cockpit data, India's CNBC TV18 reported. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it would lead a team of U.S. investigators travelling to India to help in the investigation. “The tragedy in Ahmedabad has stunned and saddened us,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said images emerging of the crash were “devastating,” and that he was being kept informed as the situation developed. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said King Charles was also being kept updated. Ahmedabad Airport, which suspended all flight operations after the crash, said it was operational again but with limited flights. The airport is operated by India's Adani Group conglomerate. The airline's Boeing-737 overshot a “table-top” runway in southern India, skidded and plunged into a valley, crashing nose-first into the ground and killing 21 people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A few months ago, Karen Bass was accused of standing by as Los Angeles burned. Critics say Ms Bass has provoked clashes between law enforcement and protesters, who have been demonstrating against raids by immigration authorities since Friday, and is in denial about the scale of the crisis that has gripped the City of Angels. A constant presence on Left-leaning CNN and MSNBC this week, she has routinely downplayed the violent scenes even as cars have been torched and journalists have been injured by non-lethal rounds. When immigration officials raided workplaces in downtown Los Angeles on Friday, Ms Bass declared herself “deeply angered” and hit out at what she claimed was an attempt to “sow terror in our communities”. Critics say Ms Bass's words inflamed the tensions between immigration officials and demonstrators, provoking riots that have lasted for days. “Karen Bass whipped all of this up,” Ric Grenell, Donald Trump's presidential envoy for special missions, wrote on social media. Mr Putman, who was struck in the ear, narrowly avoided serious injury, but said a clean shot would have put him “out of commission”. If Ms Bass is an effective rabble rouser as her critics claim, then the evidence shows she is less adept at cooling tensions. Finally, with crime spiralling out of control, Ms Bass decided to act on Monday. Others might have reached the same conclusion days ago. At that point, she conceded the “vandalism and violence” had been “significant”, long after images of burned-out cars and masked protesters had made their way around the world. Moses Castillo, a former LAPD detective who responded to the Rodney King riots that gripped Los Angeles in the early 1990s, criticised Ms Bass for being too slow and indecisive. “I think she's trying to play catch up,” he told Fox News. “I think if she had been very forceful in the beginning that we're not going to tolerate these crimes and allow police officers to do their job and arrest people on sight, I think it would have been different. “She's now saying that these crimes will not be tolerated, looting will not be tolerated, but it's a little bit too late.” To Ms Bass's political enemies – and there are many, including within her own party – these are familiar themes from the Los Angeles mayor's playbook. Ms Bass wasn't in Los Angeles when the fires broke out. She wasn't even in California, or the US. When she did return, Kristin Crowley, the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) chief blamed her for slashing their budget, leaving her colleagues defenceless when the fires broke out. But for some ill-judged comments about Cuba's Communist regime, it's possible that Los Angeles could have been spared the worst of these crises. But it subsequently emerged that Ms Bass had visited Communist Cuba several times as a young woman in the 1970s, and when Fidel Castro died in 2016 after ruling the country for decades, she lamented “a great loss to the people of Cuba”.</p>

By Yasushi Kaneko and Sho Funakoshi / Yomiuri Shimbun Correspondents NEW YORK/GENEVA — The United Nations is considering reorganizing more than 40 agencies, organizations andcutting about 7,000 jobs, including U.N. Secretariat positions, it has been learned. The U.N. was forced to make an unprecedented large-scale reorganization as a result of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration turning its back on international cooperation and cutting funding for the international body. The U.N. will eliminate some operations that overlap and reorganize regional offices, particularly in such areas as peacekeeping and development assistance, according to internal documents obtained by The Yomiuri Shimbun and other sources. After Trump's inauguration in January, there has been pressure to accelerate the process of reviewing organizations and cutting budgets, according to U.N. sources. According to the documents, there is a proposal to merge the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration and other agencies into a single new agency dealing with humanitarian responses and protections. Another is to merge the U.N. Women and the U.N. Population Fund to create an agency responsible for women and health. The cuts will be gradually carried out by not filling posts and by not renewing contracts for short-term staff. The U.N. expects to cut costs by about $740 million (about ¥110 billion) through these changes, which need to be approved by member states. The WHO, which took the lead in streamlining operations, has been forced to close medical facilities and suspend emergency medical services in some areas. There are fears that humanitarian assistance operations will be stalled in other agencies as well. As the elimination of senior positions will impact interests of individual countries, it will likely lead to backlash from some member states.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>20,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius arrived in Kyiv on June 12 to meet Ukrainian leaders and discuss future defense support for Ukraine, DPA news agency reported. The visit marks Pistorius's first official trip to Ukraine as a minister in Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new German government. During former Chancellor Olaf Scholz's tenure, Defense Minister Pistorius made several visits to the war-torn country and played a key role in establishing Germany as Ukraine's top European military donor. Amid President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to Berlin on May 28, Pistorius and his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, signed an agreement allocating 5 billion euros ($5.76 billion) in military support to Ukraine. Berlin also reaffirmed its commitment to supply Ukraine with critical ammunition and weapons. Merz has pledged to maintain Germany's steadfast support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. Berlin's role is even more crucial now as the U.S. Trump administration signaled its intent to cut down military assistance for Kyiv. Since the outbreak of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Germany has provided Ukraine with almost 44 billion euros (around $50 billion) in various forms of support, the German government said. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. MICHAEL ROBBINS is Director and Co-Principal Investigator at Arab Barometer. When Israel began to normalize relations with some of its neighbors in 2020, as part of the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, many analysts began to wonder whether the Palestinian cause still mattered to the Arab world. The Israeli military campaign in Gaza that followed Hamas's attack against Israel on October 7, 2023, provoked international outrage at the scale of violence used against Palestinian civilians and Israel's blockade of humanitarian assistance to Gaza. Considering the unprecedented level of devastation this round of fighting has wreaked, many observers anticipated that anger among ordinary citizens in Arab states might lead to significant shifts in their governments' rhetoric and policy. Some cite, for example, the fact that none of the Arab countries that signed peace treaties with Israel have broken those relations. To some observers, popular outrage in the Arab world over the war seemed like a proverbial “dog that did not bark.” After Israel began its campaign in Gaza, Arab-Israeli normalization was brought to a halt. Despite October 7 and the Gaza war, some Arab governments still hoped for closer ties with Israel, believing such relations would serve their strategic interests. But they have not been able to move forward because of public opposition. Today, unlike in the days before October 7, regional leaders cannot simply ignore their populations' support for the Palestinian cause. Ordinary citizens in the Middle East and North Africa have long supported Palestinian statehood. During that period, our organization, Arab Barometer, conducted nationally representative surveys across the region. We found that from Morocco to Kuwait, a clear majority of survey respondents described Israel's assault on Gaza using the terms “genocide,” “massacre,” or “ethnic cleansing.” Still, most respondents recognized Israel's right to exist: even after Israel responded with military force to the October 7 attacks, a majority in nearly all the countries surveyed favored a two-state solution for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But hostility toward Israel remained prevalent: just three percent of Tunisians, for example, reported holding a “very favorable” or “somewhat favorable” opinion of Israel. Support for normalization with Israel also fell, including in countries that had already signed the Abraham Accords. Similar drops have occurred with respect to other Israeli allies, such as France and the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, during the same period, views of China improved dramatically, reversing a years-long decline. In Arab Barometer surveys conducted from 2023 to 2024, at least ten percent of adult respondents in every country surveyed reported having taken part in a demonstration in the past year—a proportion comparable to that of adult Americans who took part in protests against police brutality during the spring and summer of 2020, according to polls conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Civis Analytics. As recently as April and May of this year, local protests related to Gaza have taken place in Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen. And this week, a large grassroots convoy known as the Somoud and made up of Tunisians, Libyans, and individuals from a variety of other countries reached Libya, from its starting point in Tunis, on a mission to deliver aid to those in Gaza. The convoy expects to gain participants as it continues on toward Gaza. These events, however, have received relatively little attention from international media outlets. Protests are not officially banned in most Arab countries, but most citizens understand that in practice, they do not have a guaranteed right to participate in demonstrations that express opposition to their governments' policies. Across 11 countries surveyed by Arab Barometer between 2021 and 2022, only 36 percent of respondents on average agreed that freedom to participate in peaceful protests and demonstrations is guaranteed to a “great or medium extent.” Tunisia was the only country where a clear majority of respondents—61 percent—agreed; only 25 percent of respondents in Jordan and 12 percent in Egypt answered the same. In the years since those polls were conducted, governments in the region have given people little reason to think they have become more open to dissent. In Jordan, which has a peace treaty with Israel, protests against the Israeli campaign in Gaza began taking place nearly every day after October 7, with large-scale demonstrations following Friday prayers every week. After similar protests broke out around the Israeli embassy in Amman, Israel evacuated its ambassador, and it has not since replaced its diplomatic mission in Jordan. Jordan has, in some cases, continued its engagement with Israel. In response to Iran's missile and drone attack on Israel in April 2024, for example, Jordan quietly assisted the U.S.-led defense of Israel. This support led to large public protests in Jordan, and in April of this year, the Jordanian government began to enforce a ban on the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group with a long history of organizing demonstrations against Israel and in support of the Palestinian cause—and disbanded the organization. As a result of the crackdown, during the past two months, regular protests in support of Gaza have become far less common. Instead, demonstrators have changed their tactics, including moving from urban centers to the country's ports. Over the past few months, protesters have been targeting ships docked in Morocco that are on their way to Israel to support the Israeli war effort. In April 2025, Morocco's largest labor union called for the government to ban such ships from Moroccan waters and facilitated a round of protests in support of Gaza. Kuwaitis have nevertheless found ways to show their support for the people of Gaza. The results of an Arab Barometer survey conducted in March 2024 indicated that 84 percent of respondents had boycotted companies that support Israel, 62 percent had made donations to support Gazans, 40 percent had shared pro-Palestinian messages on social media, and 22 percent had participated in public activities in solidarity with Gazans. Although Arab governments have criticized Israel's conduct in Gaza, they have refrained from taking any steps that would make it harder for Israel to continue its military operations there. Before October 7, Saudi Arabia appeared to be close to normalizing ties with Israel, even without any path toward Palestinian independence in sight. In February 2025, by contrast, the Saudi Foreign Ministry released a statement of “firm and unwavering” support for establishing a Palestinian state, a position it described as “non-negotiable and not subject to compromises,” and stated that an independent Palestine with Jerusalem as its capital is a precondition for diplomatic relations with Israel. In March, Egypt released a proposal to rebuild Gaza that was based on an Arab-led reconstruction of and establishment of future security oversight for Gaza. It was intended in part to shore up public support for Arab governments, in response to their populations' demands that they take action. And despite Trump's goal of extending the Abraham Accords to other Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, that initiative seems unlikely to bear fruit any time soon. Arab leaders may be unwilling to challenge Israel directly, but they are also unwilling to confront the public backlash that would result from closer cooperation. Moves by Arab governments, such as Morocco's cancellation of a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that had been planned for 2024, fall short of a dramatic split. Not only are Arab citizens turning out in support of the people of Gaza; their efforts are also changing regional dynamics in ways that challenge U.S. and Israeli interests. As long as Arab populations perceive U.S. and Western policies toward Israel to be based on double standards and impunity, this standoff will likely continue. And if Israel's Gaza campaign drags on and efforts to displace Gazans by force persist, it will most likely escalate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US officials have been told that Israel is fully ready to launch an operation into Iran, CBS News reported, citing "multiple sources." "The US anticipates Iran could retaliate on certain American sites in neighboring Iraq. US Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff is still planning to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program in the coming days, according to the publication. A representative of US military circles told TASS earlier that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth had authorized "the voluntary departure" of US military dependents from the Middle East due to security issues. In turn, the Department of State has ordered the departure of non-emergency US government personnel from Iraq due to heightened regional tensions. Commenting on those steps, US President Donald Trump said that Americans were advised to leave the region "because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens." He also noted that the US did not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. "We're not going to allow that," Trump stressed. In recent weeks, the Washington administration has been concerned that Israel is preparing a strike on Iran despite ongoing negotiations on Tehran's nuclear program. Axios reported earlier, citing sources, that US President Donald Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a telephone conversation on June 9 to refrain from any action that could hinder the negotiations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>20,000 people chose to be part of the Kyiv Independent community —  thank you. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed that Moscow possesses the world's most advanced nuclear systems but must significantly strengthen its ground forces, Russian state media reported on June 11. Russian defense spending has reached its highest level since the Cold War at 6.3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This is a good indicator, in fact, it is the highest of all nuclear powers in the world," Russian state media reported Putin saying. And it is important to increase their combat capabilities in the shortest possible time," he said. Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia first began its armed aggression against Ukraine in 2014, when its proxies occupied territory in eastern Ukraine and Russia annexed Crimea. Russia regularly strikes civilian infrastructure in its ongoing war against Ukraine. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. More than 20,000 people chose to stand behind us. We're deeply grateful and overwhelmed with your support.</p>
