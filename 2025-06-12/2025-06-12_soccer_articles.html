                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's everything you need to know about the tournament: Starting in 2025, football's governing body expanded the tournament to 32 teams and decided to run the revamped competition on a quadrennial cycle instead, similar to its showpiece FIFA World Cup. A new FIFA Intercontinental Cup replaced the old Club World Cup as an annual competition in December 2024 with Real Madrid winning the inaugural edition held in Qatar. Historically, the Club World Cup has featured no more than eight teams, but the 2025 edition is vastly different. “Soccer” fans in the US will have the chance to watch some of the most popular clubs, including last season's UEFA Champions League winners Real Madrid, Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich, 10-time English champions Manchester City and Italian heavyweights Inter Milan. Of the 32 clubs, Europe (UEFA) is the best-represented confederation with 12 teams, followed by South America (CONMEBOL) with six. Oceania is represented by one club, while the final slot has been allocated to the host nation's representative, Inter Miami. Mexican club Leon had qualified by winning the CONCACAF Champions Cup in 2023, but were removed by FIFA due to an ownership rule breach. FIFA said that Club Leon and another Mexican club in the tournament, Pachuca, did not meet regulations on multi-club ownership. After the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected Leon's appeal, FIFA confirmed a playoff between Los Angeles FC and Mexican side Club America that was won by LAFC. Here is a list of the eight groups: Other popular clubs such as Napoli, AC Milan, Barcelona, RB Leipzig and Sevilla also missed out due to UEFA's four-year club coefficient rankings and two-team restrictions. The 63 matches will be played across 12 venues in 11 cities. The opening match, Al Ahly vs Inter Miami, will be played at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, which has a spectator capacity of 65,000. Pasadena's Rose Bowl, best known as a college American football venue, is the biggest stadium with a capacity of 88,500. It will also be a venue for the Olympic Games Los Angeles 2028. Messi will, thanks to Inter Miami's surprise qualification. FIFA announced Miami's addition to the Club World Cup in October after they broke MLS's regular-season points record with a 6-2 win over New England Revolution to reach 74 points. New England had set the previous record in 2021 with 73 points. Meanwhile, Ronaldo and his Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr did not qualify for the tournament, but it didn't stop FIFA President Gianni Infantino from suggesting that the Portugal star could switch to one of the teams participating in the tournament. “There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup, who knows? Still, a few weeks' time, will be fun.” However, Ronaldo cleared his position by saying, “You can't take part in everything.” “You have to think about the short, medium and long term. It means that clubs such as Manchester City and Real Madrid will receive a greater percentage than smaller clubs in a model FIFA developed with the European Club Association. Hence, the team with the most wins over a potential seven matches will bank more cash, with a maximum pot of $125m available. Al Jazeera Sport will run a live photo and text commentary stream for a selection of the biggest group stage and knockout games. Online provider DAZN will stream the tournament worldwide, with territorial sublicensing to local free-to-air linear broadcast networks a possibility.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Under USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino, there will be some obvious choices for who makes up the 26-player roster. But expect some roles to be up for grabs, especially if this team continues to struggle amid a shocking four-game losing streak going into the Gold Cup. And that could lead to plenty of surprises when the squad is officially named next year. With just a year to go, Turner — the USMNT's starter since 2022 — still hasn't faced a serious challenge for his job despite his lack of regular playing time with Crystal Palace. Steffen was supposed to prove that at this month's Gold Cup, but hurt his knee and will miss the tournament. With Turner expected to find a new club where he'll be the No. Turner now has World Cup and Premier League experience, something he didn't have four years back. And he wasn't starting at club level then, either. Starting defense: Sergino Dest, Chris Richards, Miles Robinson, Antonee "Jedi" RobinsonBackups: Alex Freeman, Mark McKenzie, Joe Scally, Tim Ream, Walker ZimmermanJust missed out: Max Arfsten, Cameron Carter-Vickers, John Tolkin, Auston Trusty Dest and Jedi are locks on the outside, if healthy. But who will be Richards' partner in the middle come next summer? Right now, Miles Robinson is probably the front-runner by default. But that definitely could change between now and next June. But Ream was at the height of his powers in Qatar, and Dest has yet to return to full fitness since undergoing ACL surgery 13 months ago. Holding midfielders: Tyler Adams, Weston McKennieBackups: Johnny Cardoso, Yunus Musah, Tanner Tessmann Just missed out: Gianluca Busio, Aidan Morris That said, Cardoso could nudge one of those two to the bench if he continues to improve at pace — and if he can ever replicate his form in Spain's LaLiga while wearing the USA crest. While Adams has been plagued by injury throughout the 2026 cycle, he was excellent for Premier League side Bournemouth last season. At 27, he'll just be entering his prime next summer. The same goes for McKennie, who has been one of the best midfielders in Italy for two consecutive seasons with Juventus. Attacking midfielder: Diego Luna Backup: Gio ReynaJust missed out: Jack McGlynn Would Reyna be in this spot where he available? Maybe not, given his dearth of playing time with BVB last season. Gregg Berhalter didn't really have a playmaker in the middle four years ago; the then-USMNT coach paired Adams and McKennie with more of a box-to-box type in Yunus Musah. Another shoo-in starter when healthy, Weah should slide into the same role he manned in 2022 when he scored the Americans' first goal in Qatar. Aaronson spent last season in central midfield for Leeds United, but he's likely to return to the flank now that Leeds is back in the Premier League. Meantime, Wright — another World Cup goalscorer – can also fill in at striker. After the move to AC Milan, Pulisic is coming off the best two seasons of his career by far and could take another step forward in 2025-26. Meanwhile, Weah jumped up a level when he went from France's Lille to Juventus in 2023. He'll be even more experienced come next summer after participating in the FIFA Club World Cup and another UEFA Champions League campaign. Striker: Ricardo PepiBackups: Folarin Balogun, Patrick Agyemang Just missed out: Josh Sargent, Brian White Pepi won the job late last year with a flurry of goals in Pochettino's first two camps, then continued his prolific ways for PSV before hurting his knee. Balogun, for whom injury prevented his participation under Pochettino at all, should return to the mix this season. Then there's Agyemang, who came almost out of nowhere to become a U.S. regular in 2025. Berhalter started three different players in this spot four years ago. If Pepi picks up where he left off before injuring his knee in a Champions League match in Liverpool last winter— Pepi scored the winner before leaving the field  — the job should be his alone next summer. The rangy Texan's goals-to-minutes ratio has been off the charts in two seasons with PSV, for whom he's expected to start full-time his coming campaign.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saudi-backed streaming superpower's TV deal for Fifa's global project is next expansionist step towards a world super league “And what exactly are you doing here, sir?” To be fair, the border guard at Miami international airport made an excellent point. What are Lionel Messi, Trent Alexander-Arnold and the massed engines of the football-industrial complex doing hovering like an alien landing party over this fun, sinking sandbank of a city, a strip of land where the ocean seems to be punching a mulchy green hole in the asphalt every few miles, a place that from the air seems to be made entirely from deep-fried crumb, tropical weed and traffic? And yes, the Fifa Club World Cup is only partly here at this point, glimpsed on highway billboards that also promote accident-chasing lawyers called things such as Chuck Flip-Burger III, still to emerge from the endless noise of the US's rolling leisure economy. But it is still an excellent question that deserves a proper answer. Here is a trophy that seems to lurk, to tick and hum and buzz, that looks as if it almost certainly houses sinister things in its secret drawers – stolen moon rock, the head of a pigeon. Dazn, Fifa's broadcast partner, is billing its breakthrough global event with the tagline Uncontested. It's a good word, meaning ultimate, the best; but also with a sense of something unmoored, floating out beyond any real sense of accountability. As the clock ticks down to Saturday night's opener in Miami, as much of the pre-converted football world scratches its head at an event Gianni Infantino described this week as football's “big bang”, perhaps the most helpful thread is Dazn itself. Follow the money and who knows where you might end up. It is no secret that the Club World Cup would not be happening in the way it is now happening without Dazn. In December 2024 Dazn offered Fifa a jaw-dropping $1bn (£787m) for the broadcast rights, all the more startling in a market that was, to that point, also Uncontested. A month later Saudi Arabia concluded its own deal to buy a 10% stake in Dazn in return for – guess what – another $1bn. Two months after that Fifa announced its vast tournament prize fund, also, by coincidence, $1bn, thereby ensuring full compliance from its invited guests. In the middle of this, around the time the soon-to-be-Saudi-part-owned Dazn was concluding its Fifa TV rights deal, Fifa awarded the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia via a show of Uncontested applause from its members, thereby completing what is no doubt an entirely illusory circle of hand-washing. It seems essentially untouchable, just the way power works. But there is another, more structurally vital way that Dazn tells the story of what is happening here, a process that may have a profound effect on the way football, sport, that thing you love, is made available from here. The senate is always in a state of uproar. Known evil things – storm troopers, imperial fighters – are glimpsed in chillingly casual pose. And as ever the mood is one of head-scratching distraction. Perhaps in years to come it may be said that the greatest trick the Club World Cup pulled was convincing those who care about football's structures that it doesn't really exist, that this is a business model that can be defeated by not liking it or not following it, that will simply fade back into the swamp. Whereas in reality the empire does have a powerful new weapon, one that is being winched into place in front of our eyes, that is already in play, already digging its fingers into domestic leagues, already unmooring the spectacle. Dazn was billed as the Netflix of sports, as all ambitious tech entities must be the Netflix of something, its method to offer a simple, all-in streaming service for sports, shot through with betting, gaming, e-commerce, NFT stuff. For a while it rumbled along in the background. The boxing partnership with Saudi Arabia was a step up into serious-player status. And right now the big thing about Dazn, its superpower through all this, is that it is not actually a money-making entity in any sense of the phrase. Dazn reportedly lost $1.4bn in 2023, up from $1.2bn the year before, all the while fearlessly expanding its footprint, happy to disrupt and take ownership. And it has now found the perfect partner in Fifa, with its own expansionist aims, and also in the current generation of elite club ownership. Everyone in football wants to find the next platform. It is a refrain at any gathering of leaders, owners and rainmakers. The long-term future of this sport is as an enabler, a source of cut-though, piggyback for some future global tech service, and from there access to the real Zuckerberg money. Dazn and the Club World Cup is to some extent a trial run for this process, a way of shaking off the shackles of all those baffling legacy interests. Dazn has always denied ever having any interest in the beached European Super League, which was bound up in constructing exactly this kind of global broadcast platform. But now we have this instead, a World Super League, a product no one seems to like, but which Dazn believes will become the most live-streamed event in sports history, all cut through, all positioning, all future-building. This is why Messi has been gerrymandered into place by Fifa, why the Dazn home screen is shot through with faces not badges, stars not clubs, why the Uncontested pitch is about goalscorers, top guns, names. Even clicking on the homepage is a strangely gripping experience, like having your brain syringed through a small lighted screen crowded with endless shouted voices, from clips of Jude Bellingham admitting the Club World Cup is definitely a thing, to Dazn's Global Football Creator Program, based out of “a creator house” not far from Fifa HQ in Miami, which aims to “mobilize over 100 digital creators, reaching more than 32 million followers across platforms”. Here it is, global reach, global cut-through, the “immersive, multi-platform experience” of Pêche Football, AT Frenchies, Lisa Zimouche, BFordLancer, Alex Ramos, Jessica Vincent, Jen Munoz, Mike WoZ, Shepmates, Fabrizio Romano. This is also why it doesn't really matter whether legacy fans love the Club World Cup, why talk of unsold tickets or a lack of competitive robustness seems to miss the point, stuck in the old metrics of value. This has been billed by some as a trial run for the 2026 World Cup, as though what everyone here is really interested in is seeing if the stadiums work or the transport is any good. The Club World Cup may pass in a haze this summer. But the question of why football is here is not one that can be quietly ignored; not without that uncomfortable sense of a future that is already out there flexing its claws.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With one eye on the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup in Brazil, U.S. Women's National Team head coach Emma Hayes is planning to make some major changes to her roster. Hayes recently teased changes ahead of their next game, and more details have now emerged. It comes after USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino took notes from his USWNT counterpart However, Hayes does not intend to call up a full-strength squad, in an aim to rest most of her European-based stars, allowing them a well-earned break. “We have certainly taken a few different perspectives for this upcoming camp, and we've left out the vast majority of players that are playing in Europe, bar one, and that's Naomi Girma,” Hayes recently told ESPN. “But the rest of those players have been playing non-stop last two years without a summer break, and we think this is the only opportunity that they will get a much-needed break, and it will give us the chance to play players that are playing domestically.” Girma will return for her second consecutive camp, with injuries having limited her to just seven appearances since joining Chelsea at the end of January, when she became the first ever $1 million women's player. Reflecting on her decision to rest her European stars, Hayes explained it came down to a mixture of “performance and medical” factors. One player set to make her long-awaited return to the USWNT lineup at the upcoming camp will be Gotham FC's Rose Lavelle, having now recovered after undergoing surgery on her ankle in December. “I don't think Rose, you know, makes a really good injured player. I think she's really looking forward not just to get back for Gotham. As for Trinity Rodman, who opted to step away from soccer in April in order to focus all of her attention on managing an ongoing back issue, Hayes does not expect to see her in the upcoming camp. However, it seems the Washington Spirit star is nearing a return to action.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HARRISON, N.J (June 12, 2025) – New York Red Bulls II have appointed former U.S. Men's National Team midfielder and Princeton, NJ native Michael Bradley as head coach, the club announced today. Bradley becomes the fourth head coach in franchise history. Bradley began his coaching careering on October 24, 2023, when he was hired as an assistant coach of his father Bob Bradley's staff at Norwegian side Stabæk. This will be his first professional head coaching position. “He had an incredible playing career and is one of the greatest American soccer players ever. We see him as a promising coaching talent and look forward to supporting his development as he transitions to a career behind the touchline.” Bradley played professionally for 20 seasons, beginning his career with the Metrostars, when he was selected 36th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft at 16 years old. He made his professional debut on April 2, 2005, against Real Salt Lake and scored his first career MLS goal in a 2-0 win over Chivas USA on October 16, 2005. In three seasons, he made 70 appearances tallying 19 goals and nine assists with the club. The midfielder then spent three seasons with Bundesliga side Borussia Monchengladbach from 2008 to 2011, where he was featured in 81 matches and scored 11 goals and dished out four assists. After Bradley moved to Serie A, joining Chievo Verona for two seasons in 2011 and 2012, and AS Roma for three seasons from 2012 to 2014. He made a combined 82 appearances between the two clubs. The midfielder returned to MLS, signing with Toronto FC on January 13, 2014. In 10 seasons with Toronto, Bradley made 308 appearances scoring 19 goals and tallying 23 assists. His time in Toronto was filled with silverware, as he was a four-time Canadian Cup Winner (2016, 2017, 2018, 2020), 2017 MLS CUP Champion and 2017 Supporters' Shield Winner. He is one of three players to make a 150 or more appearances for the national team. The midfielder made his debut on May 26, 2006, in a friendly match against Venezuela. He most notably made four appearances in the 2010 FIFA World Cup scoring the game tying goal in a 2-2 Group Stage draw against Slovenia. The U.S. international made 40 FIFA World Cup Qualifier appearances and scored two goals in a 2-0 victory against Mexico on February 12, 2009. He also was a part of the 2009 Confederations Cup runner up squad, featuring in four matches. Bradley dominated the CONCACAF Gold Cup, where he's made 25 career appearances scoring three goals and adding seven assists. I'm looking forward to working everyday with this talented group of players, and I'll give everything to help them take the next step in their careers. Bradley's first match at the helm, will be on June 21 at Truist Point Stadium against Carolina Core FC with kickoff set for 7:30 p.m.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GOAL ranks the top 25 players in this summer's FIFA Club World Cup, from Kylian Mbappe to Harry Kane and Lionel Messi The FIFA Club World Cup is going to have it all: European champions, World Cup winners, Golden Boot winners, Golden Glove winners - individuals with accolades upon accolades. The biggest names in world football are heading to the United States for nearly a month of high-stakes action, as 32 elite clubs battle for glory and a share of the staggering $1 billion prize pool. Every team is guaranteed a cut, but only one will lift the trophy. Defending Club World Cup champions Manchester City return to defend their crown, joined by a powerhouse lineup that includes Real Madrid, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid, and Paris Saint-Germain - each stacked with global stars. Fans can expect fireworks up front, with Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane, Julian Alvarez, and Ousmane Dembele all chasing the tournament's Golden Boot. Midfield maestros like Jude Bellingham, Rodri (the reigning Ballon d'Or winner), Moises Caicedo, Cole Palmer, and Vitinha will pull the strings in the center of the pitch, setting the stage for a thrilling summer showdown. Perhaps the brightest performer of the 2024-25 campaign in Europe, Nuno Mendes, leads the way for defenders as well, but two of the world's best central defenders in Alessandro Bastoni and Ruben Dias, join him in the competition, too. Two of the best across Europe are taking their talents to the U.S., too. The biggest question, though, is who sits where on the throne of the best that will be participating in this summer's marquee event?</p>

Chargers' head coach Jim Harbaugh tells Fox News Digital what he looks forward to about next year's World Cup. The 2026 FIFA World Cup is just under one year away, and Los Angeles Chargers' head coach Jim Harbaugh is already looking forward to it. There are 16 stadiums in 16 different host cities, and one of those is SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. The Chargers play their home games in SoFi Stadium, and Harbaugh said he is looking forward to the "vibe" the tournament will bring. It brings people together, you roll out that pelota, you roll out that ball, and all cultural barriers are broken," Harbaugh told Fox News Digital. Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh during a press conference at The Bolt on May 7, 2025, in El Segundo, California. Just those gatherings, those tens of thousands of people that gather and the way they support their team, because that's when the magic happens. Harbaugh said he is also looking forward to watching competition "at its highest level." Head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers Jim Harbaugh and his wife Sarah Harbaugh pose for a photo on the red carpet for the "One Year to Go" for FIFA World Cup 26 event at FOX Studio Lot in Los Angeles, California, on June 11, 2025. "What I look forward to, and it's going to do for our country and our city. The ‘94 US (men's) team, just how the sport exploded after that, so I look forward to all those things." Last season was Harbaugh's first season as the Chargers head coach, as he left Michigan after he led them to a National Championship win in the 2023-2024 season. Los Angeles Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh congratulates running back Hassan Haskins (28) after a touchdown in the second half against the Denver Broncos at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, on December 19, 2024. Harbaugh said his team is "back to work" with the goal of winning a Super Bowl in mind. "The rest of us are disappointed, and the rest of us are back to work, we are chasing that Super Bowl. To be called World Champions, that is our goal." Follow Fox News Digital's sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA Club World Cup and the Concacaf Gold Cup, which are both being held in the United States, kick off Saturday and will look a little different with a few laws having been tweaked. Those two competitions, plus the UEFA European Under-21 Championship finals, which started Wednesday, and the UEFA Women's Euros, kicking off on July 2, will be played with the new regulations. In addition, FIFA is trying out the latest enhancements to its semi-automated offside technology, and testing cameras placed on a referee's headset to give fans a new perspective on the game. A shot comes in or a corner is floated over, and the goalkeeper first flops on the ground for 10 seconds. Then he stands up, surveys his options, and looks around. Maybe then he'll release the ball, though after some 30 seconds have been lost. A tactic most often by used by away teams trying to protect a lead in a difficult match, it has evolved somewhat to become part of a team's tactics simply to frustrate the opposition. The old law, which said a keeper should release within six seconds or be penalized with a free kick, hadn't been applied for many years. Now the keeper will get eight seconds, but with a clear punishment process thereafter. Once a goalkeeper has control of the ball, they will have eight seconds to release the ball. The referee will raise his arm to indicate there are five seconds left. If the ball hasn't been released, a corner will be awarded. Trials were held throughout the 2024-25 season in Premier League 2 (academies) and in Maltese and Italian football. In Italy, a different trial was held which led to the award of a throw, which was penalized once. In 160 fixtures to date, only two corners have been awarded. Boston River goalkeeper Bruno Antúnez conceded a corner at Independiente when he took too long assessing his options, and the whistle blew just before he took a long punt upfield. Pierluigi Collina, FIFA's head of referees, insists the aim is not to try to penalize goalkeepers, but to encourage the flow of the game. He doesn't expect the law to be applied super strictly, but a goalkeeper laying on the ball for no good reason will be looked upon dimly. "So [we gave them] a couple of seconds more because they may need this time to get teammates reshaped on the field. "We are confident that there won't be many corner kicks awarded. So referees will be a bit flexible when the goalkeeper has the need to recover from, say, a demanding save. But there is no need to fall down on the ground. This is only something to waste time." There will be no yellow card for an infringement, just the corner. Julián Álvarez was "incredulous" after his penalty kick was disallowed in Atlético Madrid's Champions League round-of-16 defeat to Real Madrid in March. Atletico boss Diego Simeone still hasn't got over it. Earlier this month, the IFAB announced a "clarification" to law, after it had been lobbied by UEFA. As is often the case, it takes a high-profile incident to force change. After all, no one remembers Aleksandar Mitrovic's disallowed penalty for Fulham against Newcastle United in January 2023, do they? Footage provided by UEFA shows Julián Alvarez making "minimal" contact with the ball for his penalty during Atlético Madrid's Champions League defeat to Real Madrid. Referees the world over have also treated any double touch on a penalty as an offence, even if accidental. Collina explained: "We thought that this should have been clarified because the double touch was intended to be related to something done deliberately. We decided it was better to clarify by adding two separate scenarios one when it's still deliberate and the other one when it is accidental. After holding trials during the Intercontinental Cup in December, FIFA is ready to roll out offside tech that's supposed to stop delayed offside flags when they aren't necessary, such as the one which led to an injury Nottingham Forest's Taiwo Awoniyi last month. The striker was clearly offside, and play should not have continued. It will most often be used when there's one player running through on goal. The tech will be activated when a player is 10 centimeters or more offside. FIFA reckons it could be useful four or five times per game, but we're yet to see full data. "We have in each stadium 16 tracking cameras, we have the sensor inside the ball and they're using artificial intelligence," said Johannes Holzmüller., FIFA's director of innovation. "Everything above 10 centimeters, we call it high confidence, then this is sent directly to the assistant. Everything below this threshold will go anyway to the VAR because we call it very close offsite incident. "We have reminded our assistant referees to be a bit braver, more courageous. Get ready for a whole new view of the game: as the referee sees it. Refs will wear a camera fixed to their headsets, with the footage immediately available to DAZN, the competition broadcaster. But don't get any ideas about pressing a button and switching to "ref cam." We can expect to see goals from the referee's perspective, but alas we won't be shown controversial incidents. It's described more as an entertainment add-on. It may evolve as the tournament progresses, perhaps around penalty incidents, but don't expect too much too soon. However, it's unlikely to be used in VAR reviews. Imagine that all the world has access to footage and the video match officials do not. "So basically everything is public, or can become public, has to be available also to VAR. So I would say yes and no. Yes, but in reality it is no. Honestly, I think it's difficult to believe. This already happens in the Australian A-League, so FIFA is jumping on the back of that. But it seems to be of limited value if there is no context to the pictures. Referees will also announce the outcome of a VAR review over the stadium public addresses system and to TV viewers, which we've seen in several competitions -- first tried at the 2023 Women's World Cup. "TV spectators can listen to the referee explaining first the background of the decision, and why he or she's taking a decision," Collina explained. "I think it can bring transparency and clarity to what the referee does on the field of play." Now, it's about who would take possession. Usually, this is a pass between teammates so there will be no difference. In most cases we are likely to see the referee err on the side of caution and give the dropped ball to the team who made the pass, as it would need to be beyond doubt a change of possession was going to take place. In the Champions League in the 2024-25 season, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta grabbed the ball before it had gone out of play in a match at Internazionale. A direct free kick was awarded and Arteta was booked, but by the Laws of the Game he should have been sent off. But most leagues have been dealing with this with a caution, as a red card was seen as too harsh for such a minor infringement. And here's the change: If a coach picks the ball up while it's in play, and it was no more than an attempt to get play moving again, it will be no sanction (not even a caution) and an indirect free kick. But trying to stop the opponent from restarting play will remain a red-card offence. This has already been seen in various competitions, but was officially added to the Laws of the Game this summer. It's supposed to prevent a referee from being crowded by players. While this might be easier to apply in short competitions like the Club World Cup and Gold Cup, it has proved to be more challenging in a 380-game domestic seasons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI – One unique way the FIFA Club World Cup will appeal to fans this summer is the introduction of the referee camera, which will provide viewers with point-of-view action they've never seen before watching soccer games. FIFA referees will wear tiny cameras on the sides of their heads, connected to a microphone and transmitter that will send the video to DAZN – the company broadcasting all 63 Club World Cup matches for free on its app and website. The video will also be shown inside six NFL stadiums during Club World Cup games so fans can experience the referee's decision-making process and enhance transparency during on-field reviews. Sports fans are typically accustomed to seeing cameras zoom in on referees making announcements during NFL and NBA games, while MLB fans have recently experienced the home-plate umpire's point of view from cameras on their facemask. If it goes well, maybe referee cameras could infiltrate the viewing experience in other sports. “The main purpose is to offer the TV viewers a new experience," FIFA Referees Committee chairman Pierluigi Collina told USA TODAY Sports this week during a Club World Cup referee training session in Miami. Referees will place customized molded earpieces into their right ears, then watch a screen as they adjust and tighten their cameras to the ideal angle for capturing the action. And the transmitter, called a ballpack, will be placed in their shorts' pocket. It offers a direct line of sight of the referees, especially when they turn their heads – something that wouldn't be offered if they wore a body camera on their chest. Added FIFA Director of Innovation Johannes Holzmuller: "If we replicate the referee view, it should really be 100% what the referee is looking at.” FIFA announced its referee cameras late last week, sharing a video of Pachuca's Oussama Idrissi dribbling around several defenders to score a goal in their win against Botafogo in a FIFA Intercontinental Cup match last December. The referees will also have assistance putting on their camera devices before matches to ensure they are recording as soon as matches begin. “From there, it goes live on air,” Holzmuller said. “I was sitting at home on my couch seven years ago, thinking about how to improve refereeing,” Winter said. “We have 30+ camera angles in a top match, but we can never see our own perspective after a match again. But I think it's good to give the audience and spectators a more transparent view, so they can understand what it means to be a referee. But I think it's always good to show everyone the way decision making works.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OL Lyonnes have expressed serious interest in 18-year-old Ajax and U.S. women's national team midfielder Lily Yohannes, according to multiple sources briefed on the team's discussions, who wished to remain anonymous due to the ongoing nature of the talks. Yohannes, who signed with Ajax in April 2023, is under contract until June 2026. In 2023, at 16 years old, Yohannes made history as the youngest player to start a UEFA Champions League group stage match, contributing to Ajax's 2-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in November of that year. Though she has lived in Amsterdam with her family since she was 10 years old and has played her entire professional career there, Yohannes is a U.S. citizen, born in Springfield, Virginia. She made her debut three months later when head coach Emma Hayes called her in for a pair of friendlies against South Korea in June. Ten minutes after subbing on in the second half of their June 4 meeting, Yohannes scored her first goal for the U.S. (Due to their nature as international friendlies, Yohannes was not cap-tied for competing.) Since declaring for the U.S., Yohannes has played in the 2025 SheBelieves Cup and four other friendlies this year: two against Brazil in April, and in the USWNT's most recent friendlies against China on May 31 and Jamaica on June 3. “The next two years of development will be important for her. Hayes has been equally clear about her patience with Yohannes as she grows into her career, saying, “she's got unbelievable maturity and coachability and [is] someone who I know is going to become an important part of our program, but I'm invested in that development, and we have to be patient with that considering her tender age and her lack of international and high level experience.” OL Lyonnes, one of the most decorated and dominant teams in women's football, recently underwent a rebrand in name and crest under owner Michele Kang, who acquired the club in 2024 and announced, along with the club's new crest, the construction of a performance center designed for female athletes. The club has also announced major personnel moves to further strengthen its team, which was a Champions League semi-finalist this season and Premiére Ligue champions for the eighteenth time. With the departure of former OL Lyonnes manager Joe Montemurro, who accepted a head coaching job with the Australian women's national team, Washington Spirit's Jonathan Giraldez has stepped in, leaving the DC club after less than two years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Grealish has 'broken his silence' after being left out of Manchester City's squad for the Club World Cup. As a result, his exclusion was not a significant surprise when the squad was announced, particularly as City have completed the signings of outfield players Rayan Ait Nouri, Rayan Cherki and Tijjani Reijnders this week. Grealish has been linked with a move away from City throughout 2025. And on Wednesday, Football Insider reported that Grealish 'favours' a move to fellow Premier League club Everton, who are moving into their new stadium and have money to spend this summer. The same outlet claims that Grealish has 'accepted' that he will have to sign for a new club after being deemed surplus to requirements at the Etihad Stadium. England manager Thomas Tuchel stated earlier this week that Grealish would need to play much more regularly if he was to get back in his squad. Taking to Instagram, Grealish simply posted a video of the Manchester City winger at sea while on holiday - seemingly indicating that he is taking time to think about his future. It isn't entirely clear as to when Grealish and other City outcasts, such as Kyle Walker, will return to training with their clubs.

President Donald Trump's immigration enforcers are set to be deployed at the FIFA Club World Cup Games to provide security at the soccer tournament. The first FIFA Club World Cup games start on June 14th in Miami... CBP will be suited and booted and ready to provide security for the first round of games," U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) wrote in a since-deleted post on social media. President Donald Trump's administration is carrying out plans to deport millions of immigrants as part of his key campaign pledge. The agency has been granted expanded powers to conduct arrests in sensitive locations such as schools, hospitals and churches. A spokesperson for CBP told Newsweek: "U.S. Customs and Border Protection is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the FIFA Club World Cup 26 is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the Super Bowl. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is also expected to be at the games, according to local Miami news outlet NBC 6 South Florida and The Athletic. ICE issued a warning to attendees and said people should carry proof of their legal status, NBC 6 reported. Additionally, its Air and Marine Operations will assist in enforcing temporary flight restrictions around stadiums during the matches. FIFA President Gianni Infantino told reporters: "No, I don't have any concerns about anything in the sense that we are very attentive on any security question, of course the most important for us is to guarantee security for all the fans who come to the games, this is our priority." Thomas Kennedy of the Florida Immigrant Coalition told NBC6 South Florida that the social media post by CBP was "a bit cryptic, it's sort of alluding that people should have their paperwork in order to attend the games." Kennedy added that it may make potential fans "less likely to come watch the games because of just sheer intimidation." The FIFA Club World Cup will begin on May 14 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The truth behind a Chelsea star's omission from their Club World Cup squad has come to light and it is seriously exciting for West Ham. West Ham can only watch on with envy at Chelsea's ravenous ambition in the transfer market. While the Hammers insist they can only spend a percentage of any money they raise through sales, money is no object for the Blues. There could be an upside to Chelsea's latest squad improvement exercise for West Ham, though. Hammers chief David Sullivan is banking on Mohammed Kudus bringing in the most significant funds to pay for Graham Potter's rebuild. Potter has it all to prove at the London Stadium after an inauspicious first 19 games in charge following his return to football 20 months after being sacked by Chelsea. Shipping out Kudus and a number of others for decent fees will dictate what Potter can do in the summer transfer window, which reopens on Monday. West Ham have held talks with Chelsea over a possible deal for Kudus. The Blues are said to be still mulling over signing Kudus from the Hammers – but their move for Jamie Gittens – which is expected to be resurrected next week – suggests that may not happen. Sanchez worked with Potter at Brighton and the Hammers need a replacement for released veteran Lukasz Fabianski while high-earning £120k per week Alphonse Areola is also being linked with a move to Espanyol. But there was an interesting development earlier this week when it was reported Chelsea have now decided they will sell Sanchez or Djordje Petrovic this summer. That gives West Ham the choice of two goalkeepers – Petrovic being the much more attractive option given he is still only 25 and was named player of the year on loan at Chelsea's sister club Strasbourg. But the report outlined Chelsea plan to sell one of Sanchez or Petrovic – and now there's been a major development. After missing out on Caoimhin Kelleher to Bournemouth and not being in the mix to sign Kepa before Arsenal made a move, bagging a top young ‘keeper like Petrovic would be a superb way to start West Ham's window business. In actual fact he asked to be left out so he can focus on sorting out a permanent move away from Chelsea. Many West Ham fans were not keen on Sanchez given some of the difficulties he has experienced at Stamford Bridge. But while Chelsea mull over whether to follow up their interest in AC Milan and France star Mike Maignan, Law claims the club have reiterated their faith in Sanchez and fellow Blues goalkeepers Filip Jorgensen and Mike Penders. All three have been included in the Club World Cup squad. That means West Ham now have the very realistic possibility of signing Petrovic. Especially as Petrovic could remain in London and knows he would be the guaranteed number one.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After being crowned 2024/25 Bundesliga champions, Bayern Munich are looking to add another trophy to their collection at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States. The German giants begin their campaign on June 15, facing New Zealand club Auckland City at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati (kick-off: 18:00 CET). The New Zealanders are an amateur club, with players receiving only a modest weekly allowance of around $90 for basic expenses. “It's probably our dream group,” said Auckland City striker Angus Kilkolly in an interview with AFP, referring to their group-stage opponents Bayern Munich, Benfica, and Boca Juniors. “To experience playing against those teams is a dream for us. To be on the same pitch is a little bit crazy.” Both players are expected to be gradually eased back into competitive action during the Club World Cup. Both newcomers are eligible and included in Bayern's Club World Cup squad. FC Bayern Munich: Neuer – Laimer, Tah, Stanisic, Guerreiro – Pavlovic, Kimmich – Olise, Müller, Gnabry – Kane. Auckland City: Tracey – Legos, Mitchell, Boxal, Lobo – Garriga, Ilic, Yoo – Manickum, Bevan, Zeb.</p>

Real Madrid have always been driven by star players - can Alonso break the cycle by imposing a tactical ideology to take the club into a new era? At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Florentino Perez can already see a new place in history. Perez has been making grand proclamations about it fitting Madrid's grandeur, as they prepare for the United States. Perez has long been adamant Carlo Ancelotti's successor had to be Xabi Alonso, mostly on the guidance of his more sophisticated football hierarchy, such as chief scout Juni Calafat. Perez then became even more adamant that Alonso had to take over before the Club World Cup. If Ancelotti had run his course, Madrid had to ensure they were up and running for this unique moment in history. They haven't all arrived yet, which adds to the challenge of only having three training sessions with his full squad before the Club World Cup starts. Through all that, the competition has been given one of its more compelling storylines. That is whether Alonso can impose a modern tactical ideology on a club that has traditionally been resistant to such thinking. As one rival chief executive said, “you almost get the sense they'd rather not have a coach”. Stars have always driven everything at Madrid, and Ancelotti's facilitation of them was the main reason that he became the longest serving coach, after Bernabeu's own appointment, Miguel Munoz. It is perhaps instructive that Munoz, who himself lasted 14 years and won two European Cups, was also one of the club's great players. He actually scored Madrid's first ever goal in the European Cup, in 1955, and was duly a part of those first champions. In other words, that he just enabled inherent talent. Toni Kroos and Luka Modric were the ones who imposed an ideology. It is at least striking that their partnership totally coincided with Madrid's modern Champions League era, although it was started with Alonso himself in the Kroos role for 2014. The 43-year-old, then, is not only a rare ideology manager that Madrid have appointed. He's a rare ideology manager with the playing stature to back it up. That is both what is needed at this club to transform their football approach, and what this club has always needed to succeed. If you sign up to this service we will earn commission.

The 2024-25 season seemed to show that even Ancelotti's classic approach was less effective, especially now that individualism is not quite the distinctive advantage it used to be. Alonso himself typifies a new trend of applying Pep Guardiola principles but with greater pragmatism and adaptability. He now has to adapt a system for Madrid's current stars, but at the point when it looks like a certain egotism has returned to the dressing room and the squad is ill-fitting. Alonso's plan isn't so much to bypass that problem. Mbappe and Vinicius are intended to be the two. That is why Rodrygo is going to be available for transfer, since there will no longer be a place for such a wide player. That is in turn why Madrid have been so frustrated at Arsenal advancing on Martin Zubimendi. While all of this at least starts to make sense on paper, there is obviously so much more to Alonso's approach than the arrangement of players. Ismael Garcia Gomez is a Spanish coach currently serving as Galatasaray's assistant manager, and respected as one of the brightest analysts. He believes it would have been difficult for Madrid to find someone better, especially as regards what they're doing. “The challenge is of course not only to win, but to impose a style that Madrid have never historically had. Alonso will want a style that everyone knows, to say ‘this is Real Madrid'.” The great question now is how quickly he can impose this, and to what extent we'll actually see it at the Club World Cup. Might the education process necessary - especially at a club that hasn't had this - even inhibit the chances of fulfilling Perez's ambition? The manager has to illustrate he can have a unique effect.

With only one year to go until the FIFA World Cup in 2026, and the Gold Cup starting this weekend, the United States men's national team is set to enter another tournament following a loss by four goals. It didn't end well in the Copa America last year, where they crashed out in the group stage. A year later, despite new head coach Mauricio Pochettino leading the squad, not much has changed with the World Cup looming. Pochettino was without members of his top squad due to Christian Pulisic missing this camp for rest, Tyler Adams picking up a foot injury, FIFA Club World Cup commitments, and other various injuries, but even with some top talent available, the USMNT have struggled against Concacaf opposition after losing to Panama and Canada during the Concacaf Nations League. The good vibes of switching to the accomplished Argentine manager have faded, and they've been replaced by former national team players criticizing current ones and general worry about whether this team can even perform in a World Cup on home soil. Here's what to know about the current situation In 10 matches in charge of the USMNT, Pochettino has won five matches and lost five, with the team scoring 15 goals and conceding 14. His last four matches have been especially disappointing, seeing the USMNT lose four while conceding nine goals and only scoring three. To Pochettino's credit, the USMNT have played tough matches, losing to two teams in the top 30 of the FIFA men's national team rankings in Turkiye and Switzerland, but just playing tough sides for the sake of it will only go so far without showing improvement while doing it. Expectations for these matches weren't high with a largely inexperienced side coming into camp under Pochettino, but the lack of effort on Switzerland's goals in the first half was glaring. Those failures are firmly on the USMNT players, and they're things that can't be happening with the World Cup looming. The first team regulars will return and have a chance to right the ship, but with only four international breaks remaining after the Gold Cup wraps, time is dwindling before Pochettino will need to name his final squad. Problems such as the starting striker and goalkeeper will also remain when figuring out that squad. Even if the USMNT are able to succeed at the Gold Cup, that won't answer every question after seeing how these players have performed against top opposition. I think the fact is that the World Cup is about national pride and the love of soccer, and whether you have an amazing team, whether you have a team that is maybe struggling a little bit," Kane said. Kane is right, but there's a big difference between the men's and women's teams. It will take longer than a year to improve core issues like youth development in the country, but not enough has changed since 2022 to make it seem like this team has a chance of advancing past the round of 16. Getting a very favorable path could see the USMNT squeak into the last eight, but nothing has shown that they're even a top 30 team in the world during recent years, and there is no reason to believe they are ready to get out of their group. Time is winding down to change that, and friendlies facing South Korea and Japan in September will give the USMNT time for a statement victory with their top squad, but if the issues from the summer persist, expectations will continue to drop and rightfully so.
