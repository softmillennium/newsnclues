                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Josh Stein speaks to reporters after a Council of State meeting at the state Department of Transportation building in Raleigh, N.C., Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2025 (AP Photo/Gary D. Robertson,File) GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade. The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing — also known as all-wing or blended-wing — Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners. JetZero has said it's already received about $300 million in investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027. United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production. Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina's robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903. “North Carolina is the perfect location,” Stein said. The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project earlier Thursday to a state committee that awards economic incentives. A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee — more than $1 billion over 37 years — is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers' paychecks. The incentives also include up to $784 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and $450 million from the General Assembly to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures. JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus. “We have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,” CEO Tom O'Leary said. “So this is more than just a factory. While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles. JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared. “It's going to deliver a better passenger experience than you've ever had before on any other plane,” O'Leary said. The state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets. The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County. North Carolina's previous largest economic development project, measured by employment, was revealed in 2022, when Vietnamese automaker VinFast announced plans to build an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Chatham County, promising 7,500 jobs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) was forcibly removed from a press conference with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles on Thursday. … Hands off me,” Padilla said as law enforcement pushed him out of the room. Padilla was then handcuffed by police officers in the hallway. “I think everybody in America would agree that that wasn't appropriate, that if you wanted to have a civil discussion, especially as a leader, a public official, that you would reach out and try to have a conversation,” she said, adding, “I'll visit with the senator and find out what his concerns are.” Padilla's office said in a press release sent out shortly after the incident that the senator is not currently detained, and that they are working on getting more information. “Senator Padilla is currently in Los Angeles exercising his duty to perform Congressional oversight of the federal government's operations in Los Angeles and across California,” a statement from the senator's office read. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement regarding Padilla's removal that the Democrat chose “disrespectful political theatre,” and interrupted the press conference “without identifying himself or having his Senate security pin on as he lunged toward Secretary Noem.” Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers' repeated commands. @SecretService thought he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately. Secretary Noem met with Senator Padilla after and held a 15 minute meeting.” Trump and his shock troops are out of control,” the governor said. Padilla was present and voting in the Senate this week until Thursday. Padilla's Senate colleagues, who had just wrapped a series of votes in Washington as the first videos and images of the event began to surface, offered mixed reactions. Some Republicans also expressed dismay, but others suggested Padilla sought a made-for-TV moment and chastised him for missing Senate votes. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) called on Senate Republicans to condemn the incident, calling it “absolutely terrifying.” Everybody has a job to do right now.”Murphy declined to entertain questions on other subjects.He continued, “The only thing that matters right now is that there's a United States senator in handcuffs because he was doing his job.” “To see how he was handled out of that room is wrong. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said he is looking to get “facts and find out exactly what happened,” and noted that “obviously, we will have a response.” “Somebody said this video has been out like, what, 30 minutes?, Barrasso remarked, “Do you think most senators have seen it? Noem was in Los Angeles addressing protests over a series of sweeps executed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. President Donald Trump deployed roughly 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to the city. On Tuesday, an overnight curfew was imposed in a square-mile radius of the protest area.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chipmaker Nvidia will exclude the Chinese market from its revenue and profit forecasts following the imposition of tough US restrictions on chip sales to China, its CEO said Thursday. Asked whether the US will lift export controls after trade talks with China in London this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNN's Anna Stewart in Paris: “I'm not counting on it but, if it happens, then it will be a great bonus. Huang's comments underscore the impact of Washington's chip curbs on Nvidia, a company once best known for its video game graphics processors, that has profited tremendously from growing demand for AI chips and infrastructure. The company blew past Wall Street's revenue expectations in its first quarter of 2025, posting a 69% increase from the same period last year. Related article OpenAI and Nvidia among companies building Stargate AI infrastructure in UAE But Nvidia missed out on an additional $2.5 billion in revenue because export restrictions prevented it from shipping its H20 AI chips to China. The company developed that chip specifically to accommodate US export controls but was told in April that it would need a special license to do so. Nvidia took a smaller hit than expected from the excess inventory, however: a $4.5 billion charge compared to the $5.5 billion it had expected. Kevin Hassett, director of the US National Economic Council, told CNBC Monday that the Trump administration might be open to loosening restrictions on exports of some microchips that China views as critical to its manufacturing sector. But the United States will maintain curbs on “very, very high-end Nvidia” chips that are capable of powering AI systems, he added. On Thursday, Nvidia's Huang again criticized US chip export controls. Last month, Huang said at a news conference in Taiwan that the US curbs on chip exports were a “failure” and warned that the restrictions were doing more damage to American business than to China. Nvidia's position as a critical supplier of AI chips has put it in the middle of the tech race between the US and China, which escalated earlier this year with the arrival of Chinese tech startup DeepSeek's supposedly cheap yet sophisticated AI model. The Trump administration has been eager to position the US as a leader in AI, with Vice President JD Vance saying that “excessive regulation of the AI sector” could “kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off” during remarks at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris earlier this year. Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said easing export controls could be necessary to prevent China from gaining an edge in AI. “With the AI Revolution hitting its next gear of growth it is important for China tech players they get access to Nvidia chips with the current H20 ban essentially handing a good portion of Nvidia's business directly to Huawei on a silver platter,” he wrote in a June 11 industry note. Huang announced on Thursday that his company will build the world's first cloud computing platform for industrial artificial intelligence applications in Europe. It also said its Blackwell architecture will power new AI infrastructure projects in Europe. Olesya Dmitracova and Clare Duffy contributed to this article.

A group of masked individuals hopped out of a pickup truck to hand out "Bionic Face Shields" to others on June 10, 2025. LOS ANGELES – A driver who went viral for allegedly dropping off "bionic shield" face masks to Los Angeles rioters on Tuesday was arrested by the FBI in a sting at his home Thursday morning. Alejandro Theodoro Orellana was taken into custody on suspicion of conspiracy to commit civil disorders. After the arrest, U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli spoke with Fox News. "We have made it a huge priority to try to identify, locate and arrest those who are involved in organizing, supporting, funding or facilitating these riots," he said. Alejandro Theodoro Orellana was arrested by FBI Los Angeles on June 12, 2025, for allegedly conspiring to commit civil disorders. A federal court hearing is scheduled for Thursday challenging President Donald Trump's use of the National Guard and Marines to support immigration raids in Los Angeles. Kathy Hochul called it "an assault on our American values." The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday ordered federal prosecutors to prioritize criminal prosecution of protesters who destroy property or assault law enforcement, and to make sure every case they bring gets publicized, according to an internal email seen by Reuters. An FBI agent appears in the doorway of a home during the arrest of Alejandro Theodoro Orellana on June 12, 2025. The email, which was sent to all 93 U.S. attorneys, comes a week after a wave of protests that started in Los Angeles and have spread to other major cities against Trump's immigration crackdown. Trump has dispatched some 700 U.S. Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, saying they are needed to back up immigration raids. "There should be no bottleneck of referrals for complaints and legal process," wrote Associate Deputy Attorney General Aakash Singh. "Push out press releases whenever you file charges in these matters," he said. "We will not stop enforcing the law and we will not be deterred from keeping our districts safe."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SURPRISE — THOSE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF TRUMP ‘CRASHING' THE ECONOMY WERE WRONG. Fast forward to today, and the Washington Post headline is “Trump economy shows surprising resilience despite tariff impacts.” Taking note of a number of encouraging indicators, the paper said that Trump's various trade wars may have rattled corporate boardrooms — they could have mentioned media commentators, too — but “the U.S. economy so far has kept humming along.” And this: “The labor market continues to chug as well, adding a healthy 139,000 jobs last month, which also beat expectations.” All in all, it was a “wave of good news” that “surprised” analysts who had widely predicted “higher inflation and weaker hiring” in the Trump economy. “For four months, many economists have predicted that U.S. inflation would reignite, in large part due to President Donald Trump's trade war and the knock-on effects his tariffs would have on the economy,” Bloomberg added. “But for the fourth month in a row, data released by the Trump administration's Bureau of Labor Statistics came in lower than expected.” So what happened with the dire outlook for Trump's tariffs? There has been evidence of some effects, but not a lot. “With respect to the tariffs, there was upward pressure present in appliance prices — exactly the kind of imported durable goods one would expect to be affected — that one might attribute to tariffs,” writes Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “But auto prices declined during the month; not exactly what analysts expected. Six weeks ago, even some Trump supporters predicted that inflation would kick in quickly with the president's tariffs. “I've got to confess, I've been wrong on the inflation numbers over the last three or four months,” economist Stephen Moore said recently. They did a little bit but not much, and that was offset by the fact that the economy is doing really well. Some of them, the Democrats', were in bad faith and politically motivated. That does not mean they will always be wrong. As this newsletter noted six weeks ago, “We should always note that we don't know what will happen in the future.</p>

Former federal prosecutor Jonathan Fahey discusses President Donald Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants and more on ‘Fox News Live.' A U.S. appeals court agreed to pause a lower court order requiring the Trump administration to provide due process to hundreds of Venezuelan migrants deported from the U.S. to El Salvador under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act in a near-term victory for the Trump administration. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted the Justice Department's request for an administrative stay, putting on hold a lower court order handed down last week by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg. Last Wednesday, Boasberg ruled that the migrants deported solely on the basis of the Alien Enemies Act immigration law did not have prior notice of their removals or the ability to challenge their removals in court, in a violation of due process. Judge James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., stands for a portrait at E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse on March 16, 2023. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Circuit on Tuesday, one day before that plan was due, seeking additional time to respond to the underlying merits of Boasberg's ruling. Justice Department officials argued that Boasberg did not have jurisdiction in the case, as the migrants are detained in El Salvador, and said his order interfered "with the president's removal of dangerous criminal aliens from the United States." Boasberg's final order last week did not attempt to determine who had jurisdiction. The Trump administration still took umbrage with that ruling, which it blasted earlier this week in their appeal as "unprecedented, baseless and constitutionally offensive." As prisoners stand looking out from a cell, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks during a tour of the Terrorist Confinement Center (CECOT) in Tecoluca, El Salvador, on March 26. The court "correctly ruled that the United States lacks constructive custody over the aliens held at CECOT and therefore that this Court lacks jurisdiction over their habeas claims," attorneys for the Justice Department said in their motion. "That should have been the end of this case." That order sparked fierce backlash from senior Trump officials, who have blasted Bosaberg and other federal judges who have ruled in ways unfavorable to them as "activist judges." Protesters hold signs during a march at San Francisco City Hall in San Francisco on May 1. That did not happen, however, and the planes landed hours later in El Salvador. In the months since, Boasberg attempted to hold various fact-finding hearings to determine who knew what, and when, about the flights. He later found probable cause to hold the administration in contempt of the court, citing the government's "willful disregard" for his March 15 emergency order, though those proceedings were later halted by a federal appeals court.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anti-ICE protesters march in downtown San Antonio, Wednesday, June 11, 2025. Greg Abbott speaks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House, Feb. 5, 2025, in Washington. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration Greg Abbott said Thursday he has ordered the deployment of more than 5,000 Texas National Guard troops, along with more than 2,000 state police, to help local law enforcement manage protests against President Donald Trump and the ongoing federal immigration raids. Abbott's announcement did not detail where the troops were sent, but some were seen at a protest Wednesday night in downtown San Antonio near the Alamo. That protest drew hundreds of demonstrators but did not erupt into violence. More protests are planned on Saturday in San Antonio and across Texas in cities such as Houston, Austin and Dallas as part of the national “No Kings” movement. Protests earlier this week in Austin and Dallas led to brief clashes with police who used chemical irritants to disperse the crowds. “Peaceful protests are part of the fabric of our nation, but Texas will not tolerate the lawlessness we have seen in Los Angeles in response to President Donald Trump's enforcement of immigration law,” Abbott said. “Anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property will be arrested and held accountable to the full extent of the law.” The Republican Texas governor's move stands in sharp contrast to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who has publicly clashed with Trump over his decision to deploy National Guard and Marine personnel in Los Angeles. Mayors in San Antonio and Austin have said they did not ask for Abbott to mobilize the National Guard to their cities. Since 2021, the Texas Guard has played a prominent role in Abbott's Operation Lone Star, and thousands of troops have been deployed to help clamp down on border crossings. An agreement with the Trump administration in February gave Texas National Guard soldiers the authority to arrest and detain people for entering the U.S. illegally from Mexico. Texas also has established a permanent border base for Guard troops, an 80-acre (30-hectare) installation that will house up to 1,800 troops when completed.</p>

Kevin Stitt joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his take on President Donald Trump taking action against the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles as he continues to advocate law and order. FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.., is introducing legislation that creates new penalties for rioters who burn the American flag Thursday, Fox News Digital has learned. Hawley says he discussed the flag burnings in Los Angeles with President Donald Trump and the pair agreed that desecrating the American flag should come with additional penalties. If passed, the bill would add one year in prison for flag burners on top of any rioting conviction. Hawley referenced images and video coming out of Los Angeles showing dozens of protesters and rioters burning American flags, with many waving foreign flags instead. Even my Democratic colleagues," Hawley told Fox in an interview. Anti-ICE protesters in Los Angeles burn an American flag. While courts have deemed flag burning in certain contexts to be protected expression, Hawley argues that protection falls away when a flag is burned "in furtherance of committing a federal crime," such as rioting. "No one loves or cares for our beautiful flag more than President Trump, and no one has been stronger than President Trump on supporting law enforcement against violent rioters and malcontents," White House spokesman Kush Desai said in response Thursday. Trump himself lashed out at flag-burners in Los Angeles during a Tuesday speech at Fort Bragg commemorating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. "These are animals, but they proudly carry the flags of other countries. Did you see a lot of the flags being burned?" Trump asked the crowd of service members, veterans, and their families. "They weren't being burned by people from our country, or from people that love our country. People that burn the American flag should go to jail for one year," Trump continued. We're going to try and get that done. We're working with some of your senators," he added. Trump reiterated his stance about potential jail time for those who burn American flags during an interview on a podcast hosted by New York Post columnist Miranda Devine on Monday. "I happen to think if you burn an American flag — because they were burning a lot of flags in Los Angeles — I think you go to jail for one year. In addition to potential criminal penalties for rioters, Trump has suggested he may try to go after Gov. Gavin Newsom for interfering with ICE operations in Los Angeles. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, worked with President Trump to create legislation that penalizes flag burners. During the president's comments at Fort Bragg, Trump also noted that his administration is looking into who may be "financing" the protests, saying "we're going to find out through Pam Bondi and Department of Justice who it is." Hawley has also launched a congressional investigation into alleged financial support for the rioters. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's everything you need to know about the “No Kings” movement: The phrase “No Kings” refers to the group's desire to see Trump “dethroned,” as it believes his leadership resembles that of a king more than an elected president, according to the Associated Press. The group identifies as a “grassroots movement,” saying independent volunteers organize all its local events. “No Kings” is asking citizens all over the country to rise up and protest on Saturday, June 14, also known as Flag Day, according to its website. The full list of cities, which includes Chicago and Atlanta, participating in the “No Kings” protests on Saturday is extensive. However, while Virginia's Alexandria, Arlington, and Culpeper counties, as well as Maryland, have protests planned, the “No Kings” movement will not be in Washington, D.C., according to WTOP News. “No Kings is a nationwide day of defiance,” the group's website says. “No Kings” protests date back to February, when notable demonstrations took place nationwide on Presidents Day. Protesting the actions of Trump and Elon Musk and their Department of Government Efficiency, participants marched and raised signs that said, “No Kings on Presidents Day.” Several other protests affiliated with the movement have occurred since then, according to Newsweek. Although the movement advocates nonviolence and peaceful demonstration at all its events, that didn't stop some participants at the President's Day protests in Arizona and Washington, D.C., from causing chaos. A group of protesters reportedly tried to enter the state Capitol in Arizona, and another protester in D.C. allegedly sprayed paint in the face of a Trump supporter, according to the outlet.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Protests over federal immigration enforcement raids and President Donald Trump's move to mobilize the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles are spreading nationwide. Protesters in Los Angeles are demanding an end to Trump's immigration crackdown, despite curfew and police response. The California National Guard is conducting training on civil unrest in Los Alamitos, California, following several days of protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles. A demonstration in Los Angeles' civic center just before start of the city's downtown curfew on Wednesday briefly turned chaotic with police in riot gear — many on horseback — charged at a group, striking them with wooden rods. Protests over President Trump's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws intensified after Trump called up the National Guard to the city.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello) LOS ANGELES (AP) — President Donald Trump's use of troops to help carry out intensified immigration raids faces its biggest challenge yet on Thursday, when a federal judge is set to weigh a request from California Gov. He also said that sending National Guard troops on the raids has further inflamed tensions in Los Angeles, where large and sometimes volatile protests have broken out since the crackdown began nearly a week ago. The Trump administration on Wednesday called the lawsuit a “crass political stunt endangering American lives.” A hearing is set for Thursday afternoon in San Francisco. Demonstrations have picked up across the U.S., with protests emerging in more than a dozen major cities. On Wednesday, police in Seattle used pepper spray to clear out protesters, and officers in Denver used smoke and pepper balls to control a crowd. Police in riot gear — many on horseback — charged at a group of protesters Wednesday night in LA just before the start of the second night of the city's downtown curfew. The officers struck some demonstrators with wooden rods and later fired crowd-control projectiles. Some 2,000 Guard soldiers are in the nation's second-largest city and are soon to be joined by 2,000 more, along with about 700 Marines, said Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, who's in charge of the operation. The Guard has the authority to temporarily detain people who attack officers, but any arrests must be made by law enforcement. While some troops have already gone on such missions, he said it's too early to say if that will continue even after the protests die down. “We are expecting a ramp-up,” Sherman said, noting that protests across the nation were being discussed. With more demonstrations expected over the weekend, and the possibility that Trump could send troops to other states for immigration enforcement, governors are weighing what to do. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has put 5,000 National Guard members on standby in cities where demonstrations are planned. In other Republican-controlled states, governors have not said when or how they're planning to deploy troops for protests. A group of Democratic governors earlier this week signed a statement calling Trump's deployments “an alarming abuse of power.” JB Pritzker said Thursday during a Capitol Hill hearing on state immigration policies. “We will not participate in abuses of power.” Dozens of mayors from across the Los Angeles region banded together Wednesday to demand that the Trump administration end the stepped-up immigration raids and stop using military troops alongside agents. “I'm asking you, please listen to me, stop terrorizing our residents,” said Brenda Olmos, vice mayor of Paramount, who said she was hit by rubber bullets over the weekend. “If there are raids that continue, if there are soldiers marching up and down our streets, I would imagine that the curfew will continue,” Bass said. Those who have been caught up in the nationwide raids at car washes and home improvement stores include asylum seekers, people who overstayed their visas and migrants awaiting their day in immigration court. Nine police officers have been hurt, mostly with minor injures. Some were transported to a hospital and released.</p>

Fox News contributor Brett Velicovich joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the use of predator drones to monitor violence amid the LA riots and the importance of President Donald Trump investing in drone advancements. FIRST ON FOX: Los Angeles rioters, who are ravaging the streets in protest of deporting illegal migrants, forced three Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) facilities in the LA area to shut down due to safety concerns, delaying nearly 300 legal migrants from receiving their hard-fought American citizenship. "Anti-ICE rioters are creating havoc and destroying the very communities they are purportedly advocating for," USCIS Spokesperson Matthew Tragesser told Fox News Digital. USCIS data obtained by Fox News Digital shows that 790 aliens had green card appointments canceled, 1,000 aliens had naturalization interviews canceled, and nearly 300 aliens who were scheduled were not able to attend their long-awaited naturalization ceremony. A protester places debris in a fire as Border Patrol personnel in riot gear and gas masks stand guard outside an industrial park in Paramount, Calif., on Saturday, June 7, 2025. The naturalization ceremony is the final step in achieving what for many is a hard-fought journey to successfully immigrating legally into the U.S. For Green Card holders, there is typically a 5-year lawful permanent resident period required to achieve naturalization. Sources at USCIS tell Fox that legal migrants whose appointments and naturalization ceremonies will be delayed for roughly 30–45 days. U.S. National Guard are deployed around downtown Los Angeles, Sunday, June 8, 2025, following an immigration raid protest the night before. Rioters, who set cars ablaze, looted retailers, and covered police stations and streets with explicit graffiti have been protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) removal of illegal immigrants since June 6. President Donald Trump authorized roughly 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 US Marines over the weekend in an effort to stifle the riots. The deployment of federal troops was rebuked by Gavin Newsom, who filed a federal court motion to grant the state a temporary restraining order to restrict the deployment of military personnel. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, appointed by President Bill Clinton, rejected Newsom's request. President Donald Trump in a side-by-side picture with Gov. President Trump told reporters at a bill signing ceremony Thursday that if he didn't "bring the military in, Los Angeles would be burning down right now." Secretary Noem will be hosting a press conference in Los Angeles at 140 PM eastern time to show her support for local and federal law enforcement.

Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., questions Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during House Armed Services Committee hearing. The outburst from Rep. Salud Carbajal was immediately followed by a call for decorum as lawmakers from the House Armed Services Committee were questioning Hegseth about the Department of Defense's Fiscal Year 2026 budget request. Tensions started escalating on Capitol Hill as Carbajal asked Hegseth a series of yes or no questions, beginning with the deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines in Los Angeles to quell the unrest generated by anti-ICE protests. Hegseth, are the Marines in Los Angeles ordered to protect property by any means necessary?" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, accompanied by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, right, speaks during a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday, June 12, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) "Sir, I would say the ICE officers and police officers being attacked is not political theater," he responded, before Carbajal cut him off and said "just yes or no?" Can you just say yes or no? At one point, Carbajal told Hegseth that "Kindergartners can give me a yes or no" and asked him "Do you think political allegiance to Trump is a requirement for serving our nation, either in uniform or a civilian in the department?" "Congressman, you know what a silly question that is," Hegseth responded. I'm not going to waste my time anymore. And there's been bipartisan members of Congress that have called for your resignation. You should just get the hell out and let somebody competently lead this department," Carbajal concluded. Rep. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., speaks during a Democratic Steering and Policy Committee hearing in the U.S. Capitol on April 10, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) In his opening statement, Hegseth said "Under President Trump's leadership, this budget puts America first and gives our warriors what they need. The $961 billion budget request -- more than 1 trillion in total for national security -- ends four years of chronic underinvestment in our military." President Trump charged me to focus relentlessly on war fighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards and readiness. And that is exactly what we've done since day one. We are refocusing on what is truly important, which is war fighting and our warriors, sweeping away distractions and bureaucracy. We replaced it with a colorblind, gender-neutral, merit-based approach. Our forces are responding incredibly to these changes. Because of President Trump and his America First priorities, recruitment and retention under this administration are higher than they've been in decades. Historic numbers of young Americans are putting on the uniform and raising their right hand because they believe in the leadership they see," he added. U.S. National Guard are deployed around downtown Los Angeles, on Sunday, June 8, 2025, following an immigration raid protest the night before. Hegseth also told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that "we applaud allies who are stepping up, but others need to do more, and they need to do it quickly and at the NATO heads of state meeting later this month, we expect our NATO allies to commit to 5% of GDP on defense and defense related investments, something that was almost inconceivable before President Trump led the charge in his first administration and continues in this one."

Greg Abbott speaks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House, Feb. 5, 2025, in Washington.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The commander in chief looking on at it all. The military parade commemorating the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary and coinciding with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday will be a new spectacle for many Americans. This will not be the first U.S. military parade. However, it is unusual outside of wartime, and Trump's approach stands out compared to his predecessors. Thousand of people line streets to cheer on naval units marching on Fifth Avenue in a war parade in New York, June 13, 1942. The Army had long planned a celebration for its semi-quincentennial on June 14. When he took office a second time, he found the ideal convergence and ratcheted the Pentagon's plans into a full-scale military parade on his birthday. The president, who is expected to speak in Washington as part of the affair, pitches the occasion as a way to celebrate U.S. power and service members' sacrifice. But there are bipartisan concerns about the cost as well as concerns about whether Trump is blurring traditional understandings of what it means to be a civilian commander in chief. Ceremonial reviews — troops looking their best and conducting drills for top commanders — trace back through medieval kingdoms to ancient empires of Rome, Persia and China. The pageantry continued in the young U.S. republic: Early presidents held military reviews as part of Fourth of July independence celebrations. That ended with James K. Polk, who was president from 1845 to 1849. The presidential reviewing stand with guests and guards with President Andrew Johnson on May 23-24, 1865, on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, as U.S. Army soldiers participated in the “Grand Review of the Armies. President Andrew Johnson resurrected the tradition in 1865, holding a two-day “Grand Review of the Armies” five weeks after Abraham Lincoln's assassination. It came after Johnson declared the Civil War over, a show of force meant to salve a war-weary nation — though more fighting and casualties would occur. Johnson, his Cabinet and top Army officers, including Ulysses S. Grant, Lincoln's last commanding general and the future 18th president, watched from a White House viewing stand. It ended in a U.S. victory that established an American empire: Spain ceded Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Guam, and the U.S. purchased the Philippines for $20 million. American inventor Thomas Edison filmed the floating parade. The following September, New York hosted a naval and street parade to welcome home Rear Adm. George Dewey, who joined President William McKinley in a viewing stand. Many U.S. cities held World War I victory parades a few decades later. But neither Washington nor President Woodrow Wilson was the focal point. New York honored 25,000 troops marching in full uniform and combat gear. On June 13, 1942, as U.S. involvement in World War II accelerated, about 30,000 people formed a mobilization parade in New York City. Participants included Army and Navy personnel, American Women's Voluntary Services members, Boy Scouts and military school cadets. One carried a massive bust of President Franklin Roosevelt, who did not attend. Less than four years later, the 82nd Airborne Division and Sherman tanks led a victory parade down Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. In 1952, Eisenhower would join Grant and George Washington as top wartime commanders elevated to the presidency following their military achievements. Army medium tanks move along Pennsylvania Avenue during the Inaugural Parade for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Jan. 21, 1953, in Washington. Front tanks are turning into 15th Street on way to the reviewing stand set up in front of White House. The U.S. did not hold national or major city parades after wars in Korea and Vietnam. Both ended without clear victory; Vietnam, especially, sparked bitter societal division, enough so that President Gerald Ford opted against a strong military presence in 1976 bicentennial celebrations, held a year after the fall of Saigon. The celebration to honor Gulf War troops drew an estimated 800,000 spectators. Washington finally hosted a victory parade in 1991 after the first Persian Gulf War. Bush, is the last U.S. president to have held an active-duty military post. He had been a World War II combat pilot who survived his plane being shot down over the Pacific Ocean. Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, left, and President George HW Bush watch the National Victory Parade in Washington, June 8, 1991, after Schwarzkopf led his troops in the parade, and then joined Bush in the reviewing stand. Veterans of the second Iraq and Afghanistan wars that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks have not been honored in national parades. Inaugural parades include and sometimes feature military elements. Eisenhower's 1953 inaugural parade, at the outset of the Cold War, included 22,000 service members and an atomic cannon. Eight years later, President John F. Kennedy, a World War II Naval officer, watched armored tanks, Army and Navy personnel, dozens of missiles and Navy boats pass in front of his reviewing stand. More recent inaugurations have included honor guards, academy cadets, military bands and other personnel but not large combat assets. Notably, U.S. presidents, even when leading or attending military events, wear civilian attire rather than military garb, a standard set by Washington, who also eschewed being called “General Washington” in favor of “Mr. President George W. Bush poses with sailors and pilots aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln off the California coast after landing in a small jet May 1, 2003. Perhaps the lone exception came in 2003, when President George W. Bush, who had been a National Guard pilot, wore a flight suit when he landed on the USS Abraham Lincoln and declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq, which U.S. forces had invaded six weeks earlier. The aircraft carrier was not a parade venue but the president emerged to raucous cheers from uniformed service members. As the war dragged on to a less decisive outcome, that scene and its enduring images would become a political liability for the president.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former ABC News journalist Terry Moran has announced his transition to independent journalism by launching a Substack newsletter, following his recent departure from the network. In a video shared on social media, Moran addressed his audience. “Hello everyone, I'm Terry Moran, and for almost 28 years I was a reporter and anchor for ABC News,” he said in the video. “And as you may have heard, I'm not there anymore. I'm here with you on Substack, this amazing space, and I can't wait to get at it, to get at the important work that we all have to do in this time of such trouble for our country.” I was a reporter and anchor for ABC News. Moran's departure from ABC News came after he posted a controversial comment on social media, referring to President Donald Trump and his adviser Stephen Miller as “world-class haters.” “Trump is a world-class hater,” he posted on his X account. ABC News cited a violation of its policies on objectivity and professionalism as the reason for his dismissal. “We are at the end of our agreement with Terry Moran and based on his recent post — which was a clear violation of ABC News policies — we have made the decision to not renew,” an ABC spokesperson said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. August Pfluger (R-TX) stepped up for the Republicans when they needed it in Wednesday night's Congressional Baseball Game against the Democrats at Nationals Park. The 47-year-old congressman stretched out his glove to snag the ball, stood up, and dove for third base with a Democratic runner inbound. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said before the game that they sold over 30,000 tickets and raised around $2.79 million for charity. Before the game, Williams sardonically emphasized scoring more runs than the other team, while Sanchez believed their freshman newcomers could make a difference. After Pfluger's camera-snapping catch, the Republicans took advantage. They grabbed five runs in the first two innings as pitcher Rep. Chris DeLuzio (D-PA) lost control of his command in the second. Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL), who said he threw seven strikeouts in the game, said after that he wished they would have hit the ball better but acknowledged they turned it up in the fifth and sixth innings. He added that Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN), who played right field and caught a ball near the end of the game, was the most valuable player. Steube knows what he will do after the game, which saw both teams' mostly middle-aged participants dart around the diamond for seven innings. “I am going to take an ice bath tomorrow,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>David Hogg will not seek reelection to his Democratic National Committee leadership position after the party announced Wednesday that members had voted to redo the vice chair contests he and Malcolm Kenyatta won in February. “Ultimately, I have decided to not run in this upcoming election so the party can focus on what really matters,” Hogg said in a statement. Hogg's decision not to run again ends a monthslong intraparty fight between the young gun control advocate and much of the national committee that has distracted from the party's efforts to rebuild after devastating 2024 election losses. The outgoing vice chair has accused party leaders of attempting to oust him from his position over frustration with his plan to primary “ineffective” Democratic incumbents in safe seats through his PAC Leaders We Deserve. DNC members have argued that Hogg has mischaracterized the vote. Still, members' feelings toward Hogg and his ongoing, public dispute with party leaders loomed large over the vote. DNC chairman Ken Martin praised Hogg for his work on the committee. “I have no doubt that he will remain an important advocate for Democrats across the map.” Had Hogg run again, he would have faced Kenyatta in an election for a position which, under the DNC's gender parity rules, must go to a man. “I'm grateful to the overwhelming support I've received in this reelection from DNC members and I look forward to getting back to work electing Democrats up and down the ballot,” Kenyatta said in a statement. Voting for the other vice chair seat will run from Sunday morning through Tuesday afternoon. Three female candidates who were in the running in February will be eligible: Kalyn Free, an Oklahoma Democratic activist who filed the challenge, as well as Kansas state party chair Jeanna Repass and Washington state party chair Shasti Conrad. Separately, the DNC is also weighing a new proposal put forth by Martin that would officially require elected party leaders to stay neutral in primaries. The DNC is expected to vote on that measure at an August meeting.</p>
