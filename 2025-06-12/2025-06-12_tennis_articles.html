                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roddick had reached the final stage at Wimbledon twice before, in 2004 and 2005, when both times he met Roger Federer. In each of those matches, the American had only managed to take one set in total from the Swiss legend, who won the tournament five times in a row from 2003 to 2007. The former world number one's last chance at holding the trophy aloft on Centre Court was in 2009, where, despite having been a point away from a two-set lead, Roddick ultimately lost to Federer once again. Conducting his runner-up interview, former British tennis player Sue Barker said to Roddick: ‚ÄúAfter a match like that, I just think this sport is so cruel.‚Äù Roddick responded: ‚ÄúNo, I'm one of the lucky ones who gets cheered for, so thank you for that [acknowledges crowd]. Barker said: ‚ÄúWell, you threw everything at him. ‚ÄúIt was an honour playing in front of great champions like Pete, Manolo [Santana], Rod [Laver] and Bjorn [Borg] there. ‚ÄúI still hope that my name will be up there with theirs as a winner of this tournament. After three trips to the final in six years, Roddick never made it past the fourth round at Wimbledon after 2009. The following year, he made it to round four at the event, but lost to Lu Yen-hsun over five sets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After taking home her first French Open title in dramatic fashion, tennis superstar Coco Gauff peeled back the curtain on the reality of her Grand Slam victory. In a video posted via TikTok on Monday, June 9, Gauff, 21, spoke over a backdrop of her hoisting the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen trophy after defeating Aryna Sabalenka in the women's final on Saturday, June 7. ‚ÄúActually, we don't get to take this home. Gauff then pulled out the actual trophy she received, which is a much smaller replica of the one she was presented with inside Court Philippe-Chatrier. To compare, Gauff held the mini trophy over her head and laughed. So, this is the one I get to take home.‚Äù ‚ÄúWow, the real trophy is massive compared to the one you get to take home!‚Äù one wrote ‚ÄúBut hey, memories last forever!‚Äù üò≥ In any case, as long as your name is spelled correctly engraved in The Hall of Champions and that check clears. Gauff's French Open victory was not without controversy, as Sabalenka, 27, drew the ire of many critics for saying it was ‚Äúthe worst final I have ever played‚Äù and partially crediting Gauff's win to some luck. ‚Ä¶ I think she won the match not because she played incredible, just because I made all of those mistakes.‚Äù Gauff responded to Sabalenka's comments after the match, saying, ‚ÄúI don't agree with that.‚Äù By signing up, I agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy and to receive emails from Us Weekly Sabalenka attempted to clarify her comments the next day, congratulating Gauff on social media. ‚ÄúYesterday was a tough one,‚Äù Sabalenka shared via her Instagram Story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daniil Medvedev faced a double test on Thursday at the Libema Open, playing his first grass-court match of the season and facing the unorthodox game of Adrian Mannarino. The top seed in 's-Hertogenbosch came through the challenging opener with a 7-6(6), 6-4 victory, fuelled by a strong finish in the first-set tie-break, in which he saved two set points at 4/6. Five of their nine meetings have come on grass, including a five-set win for Mannarino at Wimbledon in 2018. In a physical, scrappy match, Medvedev did not face a break point after dropping serve in the opening game. He converted two of his nine break chances, according to Infosys ATP Stats. "He plays perfect on grass, he plays low, so you cannot really ‚Äî at least me with my shots‚Äö I cannot really hit through the ball," the No. 11 in the PIF ATP Rankings said of Mannarino. "I actually make it the same for him, and that's why we both kind of can't hit winners from each other's shots, and so we just play this cat-and-mouse game, which is tough physically for both of us." In a match between two of the biggest servers on Tour, the American lucky loser fired 12 aces in a 7-6(5), 6-3 win against Nicolas Jarry. In other action, Zizou Bergs rallied from a set down to claw past fourth seed Alexei Popyrin 6-7(3), 6-2, 7-6(3). Into his seventh tour-level quarter-final and fourth of the season, Bergs will next meet Estonian qualifier Mark Lajal, who advanced after Hubert Hurkacz was forced to withdraw due to a lower back injury. Second seed Ugo Humbert retired in the second round at Roland Garros last month but showed little sign of discomfort in his first match since, beating Daniel Evans 7-5, 6-3. The Frenchman converted all three break points he conjured, according to Infosys ATP Stats, en route to a one-hour, 41-minute win.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No wonder Emma Raducanu started off her second-round contest at Queen's in a blaze of glory. A few hours earlier, the 22-year-old learned that, when the new WTA rankings are released on Monday, she will be back as British No 1. Raducanu will replace Katie Boulter, her ‚ÄúBoulterCanu‚Äù doubles partner this week, at the top of British women's tennis. Either way, it's all just in time for all the hoopla and hype of Wimbledon in a few weeks. Yet to Thursday and west London, where she still had matters to attend to on-court in the form of Slovak world No 41 Rebecca Sramkova, who is four places below her in the current world rankings. And, in essence, what the near sellout crowd were greeted to was a 76-minute sampler of what makes Raducanu such a thrilling prospect on the grass. There was, undoubtedly, oomph in her movement and persona. In an instant, she lost her mojo, was broken twice, and ultimately only squeezed to the first-set finish line. It was the sort of 15-minute blip she can ill-afford if she wants to make progress deep in tournaments this summer. Fortunately, the second set was more routine as Sramkova lost her way, and a 6-4 6-1 victory in the end was just reward for a lightning quick start. ‚ÄúLong live BoulterCanu,‚Äù she wrote on the courtside camera, a nod to her doubles partnership this week and a close-knit group of British women at the top of the game currently. ‚ÄúIt's nice, but it's not the most important thing for me,‚Äù she said afterwards, questioned about the No 1 spot. Boulter, who has held the British No 1 tag for exactly two years, started strongly against world No 10 Diana Shnaider by taking the opening set, describing it later as her ‚Äúbest tennis of the week‚Äù. In the end, Shnaider romped home to a 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory to set up a clash with Australian Open champion Madison Keys in the last eight. Boulter, understandably for a match which seemed well within her grasp, was exasperated by the end. The Guernsey local impressed in a straight-sets win over Yulia Putintseva on Tuesday but, with 123 places between them, 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina was too strong in round two, progressing with a relatively routine 6-4, 6-2 win. Still, Watson can be proud of her efforts, as she keeps her fingers crossed for a Wimbledon wild card when they are announced by the AELTC next week. Swinging from the hip like someone who had a looming dinner reservation in Kensington tonight, she grabbed the initiative impressively, against a player in Sramkova who beat defending Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova in the first round. Annabel Croft, on commentary for the BBC, described her start as ‚Äúbreathtaking‚Äù. Yet a stunning opening 20 minutes was followed by a curiously inconsistent 15 minutes, in which she let two breaks of serve slip and errors entered her realm. Mercifully, she held at 5-4 to claim the opener. The second set was more a case of remaining solid while Sramkova crumbled; the Slovak regularly gesticulating towards her corner and, by the end, her head was literally in her hands after a routine miss. Now that, an Olympic champion and world No 5, will be a serious ‚Äì and perfect ‚Äì test of her grass court credentials, just two weeks out from Wimbledon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu celebrated returning to British No 1 on Monday by racing into the quarter-finals at Queen's Club with a 6-4 6-1 win against Rebecca Sramkova. Raducanu, who will take over top spot after Katie Boulter bowed out of the tournament earlier on Thursday, secured her 11th WTA Tour quarter-final after she defeated world No 41 Sramkova in one hour and 17 minutes and could face top seed Qinwen Zheng next. The 22-year-old is also closing in on a Wimbledon seeding [live ranking 36]. Boulter suffered a 2-6 6-3 6-2 second-round defeat to Russian fifth-seed Diana Shnaider. Boulter, who replaced 2021 US Open winner Raducanu in the top spot exactly two years ago, looked sharp in her first set, saving two break points, breaking the Russian's serve twice, and hitting 10 winners. "I absolutely loved my time here,' Boulter said after the match. "I'm very well aware that I lost 250 this week, because Nottingham is next week and the scheduling's been different. Of course I personally want to be getting my ranking moving in the right direction. "I'm very happy for her to be British No 1. But at the same time, it's going to be fun for me to chase her now, and I think she's been doing that for a while. The first-serve issues that had plagued Boulter in her gritty victory over Australian qualifier Ajla Tomljanovic on Monday also looked to have largely been resolved after she landed close to 75 per cent in the opening set. They returned at the start of Boulter's first service game in the second, when she twice double-faulted to allow Shnaider to find her way back from 40-0 down and break the Briton's serve, and did so again after a 15-minute rain delay in the sixth game to take a 5-1 advantage. Boulter broke straight back and saved a set point to hold the next game, but could not claw her way to a comeback as Shnaider forced the deciding set. It began with another Boulter double-fault, but the Briton was able to claw her way back from 40-0 down to hold. "I mean, Katie is such a lovely person, I love her with all my heart, so to play her and beat her in front of a home crowd I feel so sorry, but I hope you're not going to hate me too much and come support me tomorrow." Compatriot Heather Watson also bowed out in the last-16 after she was beaten 6-4 6-2 by former Wimbledon champion and fourth seed Elena Rybakina. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Wimbledon will step up security this summer after Raducanu's stalking ordeal in Dubai where she received unwanted attention from a "fixated" man both before and during a match against Karolina Muchova. Speaking at today's spring conference, All-England Club chief executive Sally Bolton said: "The safety and wellbeing of all of the players is our absolute top priority. But we have in place - and have had for many years - processes for ensuring the safety of our players. And that is year round not just in preparation for The Championships. It is absolutely a top priority for us. "We probably wouldn't at this point comment on any details in respect of any individual athlete but that intelligence is being gathered working with those other parties throughout the year to make sure we have got the right measures in place come The Championships." Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Boulter said: "I think that's a really good thing. I think they've obviously noticed there has been a few issues with it and they are reacting to it, which is really good to see. "It's really good to see them putting emphasis on it and making the players seem very comfortable, and I think that's so important." Reflecting on what she went through in Dubai, Raducanu told the BBC: "I've definitely noticed a difference in how people are watching my back when I'm on the site. I try not to be careless about it because you only realise how much of a problem it is when you're in that situation and I don't necessarily want to be in that situation again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Katie Boulter suffered a disappointing second-round defeat at the Queen's Club on Thursday and, to add insult to injury, will lose her British No. Boulter and Raducanu joined forces in the doubles at Queen's this week, so there are no hard feelings. 34 has already poured cold water on fans' hopes that they could team up again at Wimbledon later this month. In the first edition of the new WTA 500 event at Queen's, Boulter won one singles match before bowing out to No. 1 next week, for the first time since she shut down her 2023 season to have three surgeries. Boulter's ranking suffered a blow this week because the 250 points she received for winning Nottingham last year were removed this week after the grass season schedule changed. After falling behind Raducanu, she said: ‚ÄúTennis is a funny one. It's something that happens every single week. ‚ÄúI'm very well aware that I lost 250 this week, because Nottingham was next week and the scheduling's been different. Of course I personally want to be getting my ranking moving in the right direction. I'm very happy for her to be British No. ‚ÄúBut at the same time, it's going to be fun for me to chase her now, and I think she's been doing that for a while. Boulter also suffered defeat in doubles on Wednesday alongside Raducanu, going out to No. While they enjoyed the experience, they have no plans to revive their partnership at the All England Club. The three-time title winner added: ‚ÄúI had a great time playing with Emma this week. I'm sure we will do it at some point. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Boulter will return to Nottingham next week, where she lifted the trophy in 2023 and 2024. With her ranking points already coming off, she feels she can swing freely again despite being the reigning champion there. ‚ÄúSitting here right now, I personally don't feel any pressure. I'm actually quite excited to go out and swing free now my points are off this week, so I've got nothing to lose from now,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúIt's not like I had a massive run in Wimbledon or in Eastbourne last year, so yeah, I can take a breath. I can swing free and, yeah, hopefully make a few more points. ‚ÄúBut honestly, like, I find that's not necessarily my focus. My focus is to keep improving my game, and to play matches like this today and start showing that I can beat people around that ranking, as well.‚Äù Thursday, 12th June 2025See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Titles earned by the top tennis athletes who have lived in this county reach back into the 1970s and continue through present times. Delray Beach's own tennis star Coco Gauff scored a hard-fought victory over Aryna Sabalenka on June 7 to bring home the French Open title. Gauff joins at least six other women's champions who have lived or stayed in a county where tennis thrives, drawing several elite professional players. Evert Tennis Academy Boca Raton has trained many college and elite professionals. Now she covers the tournament each year as a color commmentator. Though she was born in Fort Lauderdale, she moved to Boca at age 16 and raised her three sons born during her second marriage to Olympic skier Andy Mill here. She still owns the tennis academy with her brother and helps coach the tennis team at Saint Andrews School, where she also coached her three sons. Two-time French Open champion Martina Navratilova, 68, doesn't live in Palm Beach County, but her wedding reception was held in Palm Beach a few months after she got married and she has often visited her good friend, Evert. Navratilova, yet another women's tennis great, won the French Open in 1982 and 1984. Evert attended the reception for Navratilova and Julie Lemigova on Feb. 14, 2015. Navratilova and Lemigova got engaged in September 2014 during a U.S. Open Tennis Channel interview when Navratilova turned to Lemigova, got down on one knee and produced a diamond ring. Steffi Graf, 55, bought a second home at the height of her game in 1989 at the Polo Club of Boca Raton. She owned it through a stalking episode, dating and marrying fellow tennis great Andre Agassi and having their two babies. It was sold in 2003 when the family moved to Las Vegas, where Agassi grew up. A man was charged with trespassing in 1992 at Polo Club after trying a number of times to contact Graf. Monica Seles, 51, was the youngest ever French champion in 1990 at age 16. In 1991, she couldn't manage to evade the press after she'd won the Australian and French but had to withdraw from Wimbledon days before it began. Soon after she and her family were spotted on the grounds of Mar-a-Lago. It's not known how she knew now-President Donald Trump, who had bought the historic property a year earlier. Some felt her career was cut tragically short when a fan of Graf got on the court in Hamburg, Germany and stabbed Seles in the shoulder. Seles was out of action for two years, suffering from depression and an eating disorder. Her personal struggles began to show with arrests for shoplifting jewelry at a Tampa mall in 1993 and possession of marijuana the next year. Her single French Open title came in 2001 after winning only one match between 1994 and 1998. Capriati had to stop competing in 2004 because of injuries. Years late, she faced criminal charges and was saved from a drug overdose, both in or near her 2,800-square-foot condo on Singer Island, which she bought in 2007. In June 2010, Capriati was rushed to St. Mary's Medical Center for an accidental overdose of prescription medication. In 2013, she was arrested on charges of stalking and battery against her ex-boyfriend, Ivan Brannan Jr., who also owned a condo on Singer Island. In a Valentine's Day incident, Capriati punched her boyfriend in the chest at a North Palm Beach gym. On Feb. 18, a co-worker of Brannan's told North Palm Beach police that Capriati tried to get into a locked door at their office. She was pacing, yelling and pounding on a window. That was the ninth incident involving Capriati and Brannan in which police were called to investigate. Charges against Capriati were dropped after she completed anger management classes and community service. Serena Williams, 43, considered the greatest women's tennis player of all time, moved to Palm Beach County with her tennis star sister Venus when she was 9 in order to be coached by Rick Macci in Boca Raton. Williams owns 23 Grand Slams titles, three from the French in 2002, 2013 and 2015. Venus, no slouch herself with seven Grand Slam titles, never took a French Open. Together they bought a property with an 8,500-square-foot home featuring two master suites in Ballenisles in 2000, according to Palm Beach County official records. She has owned a number of north county properties along with her husband, Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian. Coco Gauff's family moved to Delray Beach when she was 7, but The Palm Beach Post learned recently that Gauff was actually born at West Boca Medical Center. She came early, during her mother's baby shower, so despite her parents living in Atlanta at the time, she's a true Palm Beach County native. The shower, which carried on without Candi, Coco's mother, was hosted at the home of Coco's grandmother, Yvonne Lee Odom, who in 1961 was the first Black student to attend Delray Beach's all-white Seacrest High School. Yvonne Odom and her husband, Eddie Odom Jr., founded the Delray Beach American Little League to extend the sport to kids in mostly Black neighborhoods not covered by the other league. Gauff grew up in Delray Beach, training at Pompey Park. "They are the reason why I wanted to pick up a tennis racquet." Holly Baltz is an editor at The Palm Beach Post.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former British tennis star and current pundit Andrew Castle doesn't believe Andy Murray would've been coaching Novak Djokovic in the literal sense of the word. However, their intriguing partnership was short-lived, ending just six months later in May before the French Open. A flurry of speculation about why they parted ways soon followed. Despite initial plans to maintain their professional relationship until Wimbledon, a string of disappointing results for Djokovic seems to have prompted a change of heart. Castle, 61, has a hunch that Murray was actually brought on board to provide tips to the 24-time Grand Slam champion, suggesting his role was "not the same" as a traditional coach. "I don't see it as a coaching relationship," Castle said to Betway. "I don't see those types of relationships; I see it as support and somebody who has been in the trenches as well and understands [what is needed]. "Novak may need an observation now and again and you might say something along the lines of, 'You're 37 now and need to get to the ball earlier on a rally because you don't cover the courts as quickly as you did. "That was what I would see as those relationships but it's certainly not the same type of coaching as going down the club and getting the club pro to take me through [some techniques]." Upon ending his partnership with Murray, Djokovic said: "We felt like we couldn't get more out of that partnership on the court, and that's all there is to it. "My respect towards Andy remains the same, even more actually, I got to know him as a person. "I would do it again at some stage," Murray told the BBC. "I don't think that will happen immediately. I wasn't planning on going into coaching as soon as I finished playing but it was a pretty unique opportunity. "It was a brilliant opportunity for me. We got to spend some really nice moments away from the court. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

Mark Lajal benefited from the forfeit of Hubert Hurkacz on Thursday afternoon. He'll play the winner of the match between Australian Alexei Popyrin, the No 4 seed, and Belgian Zizou Bergs in the next round

Estonian qualifier Mark Lajal reached the quarter-finals of the's-Hertogenbosch Open after Pole Hubert Hurkacz, the No 5 seed, withdrew before the match on Thursday at the Autotron Rosmalen.

Lajal, ranked No 195, will play the winner of the match between Australian Alexei Popyrin, the No 4 seed, and Belgian Zizou Bergs next.

Ahead of his victory, the 22-year-old Estonian won against Serb Laslo Djere (6-2, 6-4).

Hurkacz, ranked No 32, defeated Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut (7-6 (2), 6-4) in the previous round of the Rosmalen tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The phasing out of line judges at Wimbledon was an ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù development, All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) chief executive Sally Bolton said Thursday. It will instead rely on electronic line calling (ELC), as is used at the Australian and U.S. The tournament's pool of 300 judges has been condensed to 80 ‚Äúmatch assistants,‚Äù two of whom will be assigned to each court. They will support the umpires in managing what happens on the court and are there as a backstop should ELC go down. ‚ÄúSo I think for many of them they had expected this change to come along and for those that will be joining us for the Championships in the match assistant role obviously they're delighted still to be part of delivering the Championships.‚Äù ELC is compulsory at all ATP and mixed tour-level events. Discreet testing was carried out during last year's Wimbledon, where the ball tracking and line technology has been in place for more than 15 years. In 2007, Wimbledon used Hawk-Eye technology for the first time, allowing players to challenge line calls. ‚ÄúThe time is right for us to move on,‚Äù Bolton said. And we do have a significant number of them coming back in a new role as match assistants, so we're really pleased to have many of them still involved with delivering the championships.‚Äù This will not be an issue on grass courts. Wimbledon has also announced the prize money pool for this year's event, with an increase of seven percent on 2024 to ¬£53.5 million ($72.7 million), which is double the pot of 10 years ago. At the lower end of the tournament, there have been similar increases, with first-round losers receiving ¬£66,000 (89,691), a 10 percent increase from last year. Some of those players met with the Grand Slam representatives, including Bolton and AELTC chair Deborah Jevans, in Paris during the French Open. They both said it was important to continue that dialogue, but Jevans stressed the importance of looking at the ‚Äúbigger picture‚Äù around scheduling and burnout, and not just prize money. Jevans added that ‚Äî having been one herself, once reaching the Wimbledon fourth round ‚Äî she knew that ‚Äútennis players, they're always going to, I think, ask for more money.‚Äù Jevans added that Wimbledon has no plans to become a 15-day event like the other Grand Slams. The Greater London Authority (GLA) granted the AELTC planning permission at a hearing in September 2024, but after appeals led by the Save Wimbledon Park (SWP) group, a judicial review will take place July 8 and July 9 of 2025, in which the AELTC and SWP will outline their arguments. After appealing to the courts for the case to be expedited, a separate hearing will be held on this matter in January 2026. The AELTC is desperate to press on with its expansion plans as it continues to lose ground on the other three majors. Jevans said that the need for the transformation ‚Äúbecomes ever more apparent as we see our fellow Grand Slams staging fully integrated three-week events by welcoming many more spectators and staging charity and community events during the qualifying week and, crucially, providing the players with a stage benefiting their sporting excellence.‚Äù Charlie Eccleshare  is a tennis writer for The Athletic, having previously covered soccer as the Tottenham Hotspur correspondent for five years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OAKMONT, Pa. ‚Äî The first shot of the 125th U.S. Open on Thursday embodied so much of what this championship is about. Matt Vogt, an Indiana dentist who went through 54 holes of qualifying, sent his tee shot soaring into the rough at Oakmont. Vogt, who once caddied at Oakmont before moving on to root canals, managed to use the severe slope of the first fairway for his ball to tumble onto the green for a par. 1; for Bryson DeChambeau, the defending champion; and for everyone to face an Oakmont course reputed to be the toughest in the land. The USGA is particularly fond of Oakmont, a big reason why the U.S. Open returns to his course for a record 10th time. It has been on the minds of all 156 players ‚Äî from Scheffler and Masters champion Rory McIlroy to the 15 amateurs, and for the 16 players, like Vogt, who had to make it through 18 holes of local qualifying and then 36 holes. Zac Blair had the first birdie of this championship, holing a putt from nearly 45 feet on the 10th hole after starting his round on the back nine. From just short of the 10th green, it took him two hacks to get it out of the cabbage-like rough, the second chip rolling and rolling some 12 feet by the hole. That's what Oakmont does ‚Äî thick, gnarly rough and some of the fastest putting surfaces around. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu will be hoping to attack the grass-court season this year, given it is a surface she has enjoyed success on in the past. And, given it is only a short part of the tennis calendar, the opportunities to compete on it are sparse. In the past, Eastbourne and Nottingham have been a large part of her Wimbledon preparation, but this year she has also opted to take part in Queen's, which is allowing women to compete for the first time since 1973. It was a historic opportunity that the Brit could not pass up, but one decision she has made might be risking her chances of playing in the next big Grand Slam. After all, her latest fitness update was far from ideal. Speaking ahead of Queen's earlier this week, Emma Raducanu admitted: ‚ÄòI got back from Paris last week and then I got straight back on the court. I know I have been managing my back for the last few weeks now and it's something that comes and goes. All I can do is deal with what's in front of me. She therefore admitted that she is not putting too much pressure on results in the coming weeks, noting: ‚ÄòOf course you want to win this tournament, like every tournament, but especially when it's at home. Nobody expected a qualifier to win the US Open, yet she accomplished it. Clearly thriving in the underdog role, it feels like she will certainly be given that mantle once again heading into these next few events. However, with such a recurring back injury, there's a worry that she might actually be putting too much on her plate ahead of Wimbledon. After all, even if they exit early, Raducanu's decision to play doubles with Katie Boulter at Queen's alongside singles might be putting additional unnecessary effort onto a body that has broken down routinely in the past. And with Eastbourne and the German Open potentially to come too, all before Wimbledon, there's a fear that she may be risking too much. Annabel Croft certainly thought as much, noting after her first win: ‚Äò[There wasn't] any sign of that whatsoever, if her back was really bad, I don't think we'd see her be playing doubles with Katie Boulter, you wouldn't want to stress your body any more than you would want to. I think some of these niggles, it's a little bit like when you agree to run the marathon, you start feeling like your legs and knees are hurting before you go out there to run it.' Decisions like this can either go one of two ways: she could find form and fitness and put herself in the perfect position for a strong campaign at the All England Club, or struggle once again to be fit enough to compete.</p>
