                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It looked as if the votes was heading to defeat, but House Speaker Mike Johnson convinced some members to change their votes, only the latest instance of him intervening at the last minute to save parts of Donald Trump‘s agenda. The bill claws back $535 million in funding for fiscal year 2026 and $535 million in funding for fiscal year 2027. Another Harvey Weinstein Rape Retrial Could Start This Fall, Judge Says; Current Case Ends In Mistrial  As Jury Foreman Won't Return To Deliberations - Update With congressional approval, that would put the cuts on a sounder legal footing than an executive order. The House voted to cut NPR funding in 2011. Mitt Romney argued for eliminating funding during his 2012 presidential campaign. The Trump administration proposed zeroing out public broadcasting funding for each of the four years of his first term. But with lobbying from parents, viewers and such characters as Big Bird, public media has survived amid bipartisan support from lawmakers who have cited their support for public media outlets in their own communities. But those arguments may be unable to overcome a long-held desire on the right to eliminate the funding. That seems to have put pressure on GOP lawmakers to show examples of their fiscal restraint, even as Democrats have attacked them for the package of rescissions cuts. During debate on the House floor, Republicans cited instances that they say proved public media bias. But the action also reflected Trump's latest effort to undermine media outlets he does not like. His FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, has launched investigations of Comcast and Disney, among others, over their DEI practices. Some GOP lawmakers, though, said that the situation with public broadcasting was different, framing it as a matter of using tax dollars to back media outlets they say promote a left-wing agenda. Public media advocates, though, say that detractors have cherry picked instances when overall, trust in NPR and PBS remains high. A Pew survey in March put PBS high on the list of trusted news sources, along with the BBC. The Senate can pass the bill by simple majority, or it can merely not act on it. Congress has 45 days to act on Trump's rescissions request, meaning that the Senate has five more weeks to pass it, or the funding will go to public media as planned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. A tender and gently probing Norwegian drama about a pair of Oslo chimney sweeps whose lives are forever changed when they casually open up to each other in between jobs one morning, Dag Johan Haugerud's “Sex” — the standalone first installment of the director's Kieślowski-inspired “Sex, Love, Dreams” trilogy — is a far cry from the prurient spectacle promised by its title. Indeed, this sweet and chatty film, in which sex is often discussed but never depicted, could just as easily have been called “Love” or “Dreams” (that it wasn't seems like a joke typical of Haugerud's dry sense of humor). But that isn't to accuse the director of a bait-and-switch. While “Sex” may be light on the act itself, the movie is deeply — almost spiritually — engaged in what it means to people, and why it plays such an outsized role in the way that we self-identify and see each other. Related Stories Keira Knightley Says ‘I Was Seen as a Terrible Actress' Until ‘Pride & Prejudice' Vicky Krieps Is Possessed by Her Dead Wife in Trailer for Psychological Drama ‘Went Up the Hill' “Sex” is a story about the parts of ourselves that we decide to share with each other, and even more so a story about the vulnerability of sharing them. It starts with the higher-ranked of the two chimney sweeps (the handsome Thorbjørn Harr, whose rugged dad aesthetic belies his character's youthful naivete) talking his similarly unnamed subordinate (Jan Gunnar Røise) through a dream he had the previous night — a dream in which a divine figure who may or may not have been David Bowie looked at him as if he were an attractive woman. What inspires the CEO to share this information with his colleague? Perhaps he just needed to hear what it sounded like out loud (“It's strange how dreams change when you start talking about them,” he observes). We certainly get the impression that it's a radical change of pace to the usual conversations between these men, which Haugerud's sterile, interrogative framing suggests are more focused on avoiding feelings than sharing them. As if to put the CEO at ease, he counters with an unexpected confession of his own: He had sex with a male customer the previous day. He insists that he isn't gay (“Having one beer doesn't make someone an alcoholic” the man says without a hint of defensiveness, anticipating a movie in which homosexual urges are a freighted invitation for self-understanding rather than something to be exorcised or submitted to), but, much like what happened in the boss' dream, he was activated by the fact of being wanted by a stranger. A different kind of film might have used that coincidence to spark a furtive romance between the two men, but “Sex” is more interested in seeing how these men — especially the underling — process their feelings on their own time. Røise's chimney sweep immediately tells his wife (Siri Forberg, introduced in a long-take that hides her face from view) about the encounter, assuming that she'll be as bewildered by it as he is. It's not the act itself that upsets her so much as the intimacy he experienced without her; she ascribes to Milan Kundera's view that sex is rooted in a mutually shared mystery, and after 20 years of marriage she resents the idea that someone else knows what her husband's face looks like when he comes. Betrayed and wounded but never shrill or judgmental, she initially demands that he fill in the blanks of her imagination (How did they arrange their bodies? Her husband swears that he has no interest in repeating the experience, but his insistence further exacerbates the woman's questions — often pained, but never shouted or showy — about why and how we limit ourselves to accommodate each other. That last question looms particularly large over the course of a film that loves its characters for their anguished curiosity, and delights in being freed from the burden of having to draw its own conclusions in order to resolve a clear plot. “You're making it your story,” he cries, as if that were a greater betrayal than cheating on her. As if love itself weren't a desperately beautiful effort to create something bigger than our bodies. That plot, and its nested digression about the CEO's teenage son, can't help but feel a bit unformed in comparison to his colleague's marital problems, but there's an effervescent joy in Harr's performance as a conservative man who's taking stock of himself for the first time in his life, and that effervescence is complemented by the summer warmth of Cecilie Semac's cinematography. This isn't a movie that's for or against monogamy, so much as it's a touching — and, during its final minutes, even vaguely transcendental — study of how we're all too infinite to stay bottled up within ourselves. As that doctor tells the CEO when describing what it's like for a woman to have intercourse at the same time as there's a fully-developed fetus in her belly: “It's amazing all the people your body can and has to accommodate.” Strand Releasing will release “Sex” in select theaters on Friday, June 13.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a stunning moment in Sabrina Carpenter‘s Short n' Sweet tour, when she performs the heartbreak anthem “Lie to Girls.” She stands on stage strumming an acoustic guitar, as the crowd sings every word of the ballad: “You don't have to lie to girls/If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves.” In her new Rolling Stone cover story, Carpenter notes that this particular portion of the show is rarely captured on video or photographed. That's because a majority of the crowd is fixated instead on the sexual aspects of the Short n' Sweet shows, from Carpenter's outfits (corseted bodysuits glittering in sequins, garter belts, lacy baby-doll nighties) to her horny choreography, like when she acts out sex positions to “Juno,” her indie pop gem about getting pregnant. You might have noticed that she's received some backlash over this on the internet, which is something Carpenter can only laugh about. “It's always so funny to me when people complain,” she told RS. “They're like, ‘All she does is sing about this.' But those are the songs that you've made popular. There's so many more moments than the ‘Juno' positions, but those are the ones you post every night and comment on. I find irony and humor in all of that, because it seems to be a recurring theme. I'm talking about every female artist that is making art right now.” Brian Wilson, Beach Boys Co-Founder and Architect of Pop, Dead at 82 ‘No Fat Soldiers': Ft. Bragg Troops Were Carefully Screened for Trump's Stunt Visit She continued: “We're in such a weird time where you would think it's girl power, and women supporting women, but in reality, the second you see a picture of someone wearing a dress on a carpet, you have to say everything mean about it in the first 30 seconds that you see it.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim Zolciak and Kroy Biermann have finally exited the Georgia mansion that was the backdrop for numerous fights and police calls. According to Page Six, the US Marshals intervened and removed them from the home on April 8, 2025. As per a court filing, four deputy marshals “ejected” Zolciak and Biermann from the Atlanta mansion from 3:30 p.m. to 6:45 p.m. The former reality star and the ex-NFL player finally sold their mansion in February 2025 for $2.75 million — $3 million less than the original asking price — after it was on the market for a year and a half. According to Page Six, Kroy Biermann filed for divorce from Kim in the summer of 2023, and now that the issues with their Georgia mansion have been resolved, the exes are finally able to focus on what they hope is a positive future. Kim has relocated to a rental property with their four minor children: Kroy Jr. (also known as KJ), 14, Kash, 12, and 11-year-old twins Kaia and Kane. They also share daughters Brielle, 28, and Ariana, 23, whom Biermann adopted back in 2012. According to Ariana Biermann, Kroy has stepped away from the drama and is living a quiet life by himself. The ex-reality star has also undergone a serious career change. He now oversees logistics and helps with improving workplace efficiency at Superior Rigging and Erecting Co.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I can't be inside there," the jury foreperson said Wednesday. Harvey Weinstein's rape charge ended in mistrial after the jury foreperson refused to return to the jury room Thursday saying he faced threats from other jurors. After the mistrial was declared, prosecutors said Thursday that they plan to retry Weinstein on the rape charge, related to aspiring actress Jessica Mann, and that “she is ready and willing and wants to retry this count.” A July 2 hearing has been set on that charge. Harvey Weinstein Trial Witnesses React to Mixed Verdict, See Win for #MeToo Movement Harvey Weinstein Receives Mixed Partial Verdict as Deliberations Heat Up in Criminal Case Weinstein faced one charge of rape in the third degree and two charges of criminal sexual act in the first degree, which is the higher felony charge and carries a maximum prison sentence of 25 years. The rape charge carries a sentence of up to four years. Weinstein's attorneys said they will appeal the criminal sexual act conviction and conduct further investigation into possible juror misconduct. He added that other jurors had been trying to get him to change his decision, and, when he had refused, had said “Oh we will see you outside,” and that he was concerned for his own safety. However, Farber spoke with the others jurors after the mistrial was declared Thursday and said “they were extremely disappointed” that deliberations had not continued and that “they don't understand why the foreperson bowed out.” Jury tensions had reached such a fever pitch Wednesday that Weinstein himself addressed the court, urging the judge for a mistrial. “This is my life that's on the line, and you know what? He returned to court, but was being kept separately from the other jurors Thursday morning. All of this comes after Weinstein's 2020 rape and criminal sexual assault conviction was overturned in April 2024 after the court of appeals found the trial prejudiced Weinstein with improper rulings, including allowing women to testify about allegations that were not part of the case. In the 2020 trial, Weinstein received a mixed verdict with the jury finding Weinstein guilty of the crimes against Haley and Mann, but also acquitting Weinstein of first-degree rape and predatory sexual assault related to other women. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg pursued the retrial of Weinstein shortly after his conviction was overturned. Weinstein has already served six years of that sentence, which Aidala said would count toward times served in sentencing for this case. After later attending his Oscars party, Mann said she was invited by Weinstein up to his hotel room, where he said he wanted to give Mann and her friend a script for Vampire Academy. After that incident, Mann said she decided to embark on a relationship with him. At the time, Mann was visiting New York City with friends and said she had arranged to meet Weinstein for breakfast, along with her friends, but found that he had arrived early at her hotel and was in the process of booking a hotel room. Despite her protests, Weinstein booked the room and she followed him upstairs. Once there, she claims he repeatedly held the door shut as she tried to leave and said she didn't want to do this, while he grabbed her arms and told her to undress. She did so, and said Weinstein then went to the bathroom and injected himself with a substance which she later found was to treat erectile dysfunction, and then performed unwanted penetrative sex on her.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a lot of people — Sabrina Carpenter included — the online drama surrounding her supposed part in Olivia Rodrigo‘s “Drivers License” love triangle drama feels like a lifetime ago. It all stemmed from lyrics on Rodrigo's Billboard Hot 100-topping debut single, on which she sings, “You're probably with that blonde girl, who always made me doubt.” Years later, the Girl Meets World alum is far better known for her own chart-toppers such as “Please Please Please” following the success of her breakthrough 2024 album Short n' Sweet, and Carpenter and Rodrigo have even been spotted looking friendly at events in the years since the drama unfolded. But in her Rolling Stone cover story published Thursday (June 12), the two-time Grammy winner shared what being the target of so many rumors taught her. “All I knew was that it wasn't going to stop me from doing what I loved, ever,” she told the publication. Sometimes, it's about how you are able to be resilient. What that era taught me was to just trust myself, and trust that everything is going to work out the way it's supposed to, and trust that relationships are put into your life for a reason. Noting that she “didn't really intentionally” try to change public opinion of her post-“Drivers License,” Carpenter revealed whether or not she ever ruminates on that time period. “I don't think about it, ever,” she deadpanned. The “Taste” artist, who earlier in the story revealed that she sometimes wears a brown wig to disguise herself in public, jokingly added, “I've tried being ­brunette, and it didn't look good on me, so this is what it is.” It's not the first time Carpenter has addressed what happened in 2021. “But at the same time, there are real people. I will say, that's the hardest thing — trying to be truthful to yourself, make art that feels real and exciting, but then also knowing that [you're writing] about humans going through what we're all going through on a daily basis.” The Rolling Stone interview comes just one day after Carpenter announced her new album, Man's Best Friend, which follows the release of lead single “Manchild” earlier this month. The LP will drop Aug. 29, almost exactly one year after she released Short n' Sweet. “They would release a 10-song album every year,” she said.

Coming from “BoJack Horseman” creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, it's without the parody dressing “BoJack Horseman” presents, instead getting closer to the heart of human conflict and comedy. Screening at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival this week, the first episode of the “BoJack” creator's latest animated Netflix series sees Avi (Ben Feldman) bring his new girlfriend Jennifer (Abbi Jacobson) to meet his family ahead of his little brother Yoshi's (Max Greenfield) Bat Mitzvah. It drowns you in overlapping dialogue, religious anxiety, and eccentric family members, immediately distancing itself from Waksberg's past work. Related Stories David Lynch's ‘Unrecorded Night' Might Be Released as a Book, Says Daughter Jennifer Lynch: Fans Should Be Able to ‘Sit with His Ideas' ‘Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' to End with Fifth Season of Six Episodes — Third Season Premieres July 17 “I was thinking about family, time, and identity,” Waksberg told IndieWire at Annecy. More specifically, I was thinking about how our relationships with our family change over time, and how our identity changes over time, and the ways we see ourselves and think about ourselves, and how so much of that is defined by our family. In some ways, we repeat what our parents did, and in some ways, we overreact to what our parents did. To think about that cause and effect on a longitudinal scale was really interesting.” “I would say it feels more personal than autobiographical, because you don't know my biography. But I wanted it to feel real and lived in. I'd say all my work is personal in that way. I'm of the belief that on some level, all art is autobiographical, sometimes in ways you don't even realize.” Authentically depicting family made Waksberg write in a different register than what “BoJack” offered audiences. I wanted to have multiple conversations happening at the same time, and an awareness that the audience is not going to hear everything, and that's okay, that's a little leap of faith that people aren't going to feel like, ‘Wait, what's going on?' Part of making a show is teaching your audience how to watch it. We want to be intentional in signaling to the audience that, if you missed something, don't worry, you're not supposed to get everything, maybe watch it a second time and pick out what other people are saying. He added, “This part is actually very autobiographical. It's based on my family and probably other families as well. If you're not raised in that mode, it can be very overwhelming and off-putting, but I'm interrupting you because I'm showing that we're in this together. So I think trying to write in that mode was very intentional.” “A lot of stories about religion are centered around faith, because that is the Christian narrative, and faith is such an important part of Christianity and Judaism as I've experienced it. Returning from working on “BoJack” with Waksberg, as well as Netflix's “Tuca & Bertie,” is character designer Lisa Hanawalt, whose work is more restrained, more minimal, than what she showcased on her previous series. “We wanted it to not look like ‘BoJack' or ‘Tuca.' We didn't want it to be mistaken as a spinoff and feel like BoJack can walk in any minute. That was the main guidance I gave her. We did a lot of tests to see how expressive they could be, and you look at old ‘Peanuts' comics. It was really fun to think about new ways of using eyes on this show.” When he spoke to IndieWire last year, Waksberg discussed how “BoJack Horseman” had to be tailored around how audiences watch shows on streaming: linearly and often all at once. “I was interested in thinking about how audiences watch shows. One thing I have felt is that ‘BoJack' has done very well, even for people who weren't watching when it was on. Waksberg said, “That's harder to do with fewer seasons with shorter episode orders, which you see a lot of in streaming. Can you shortcut that a little bit by jumping around time and watching these characters grow up? Given the landscape of television right now, I'm probably not going to get 100 episodes. Is there a way to get some of that same effect?” At the end of the credits, “Long Story Short” makes a point to stress that “This Programme Was Made By Humans.” “It's a bit of a toothless guarantee, because there's no standard at this point, there's no Humane Society of Anti-AI to certify this as the correct amount of non-automation,” said Waksberg. In the writing, too, we want it to feel personal. I get to be surprised by the brilliance and the experience of these other people that have worked on it. And I do feel like we need to draw some lines in the sand. I don't know what that line is, but I think it is worth talking about, as audiences [are] saying we don't want AI art.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Key changes include the division of the Best Country Album category into two awards: The original category is now called Best Contemporary Country Album, and a new one, Best Traditional Country Album, has been added. Notably, Beyoncé won the 2025 Best Country Album Grammy in her first year of nomination in the category; her Lemonade song “Daddy Lessons” was controversially rejected by the country music committee in 2016. A shakeup in the packaging field has led to the creation of a new category, Best Album Cover, as well as the merging of the Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package category—in which Jeff Mangum was a surprise 2024 nominee—with Best Recording Package. Albums sold directly to fans will also qualify for packaging Grammys from now on. Elsewhere, Best New Artist eligibility has expanded. That remains the case, with some exceptions. If your prior Album of the Year nomination would not have been eligible under the new, tighter parameters, you are now, once again, eligible for Best New Artist. The overall changes, said Harvey Mason Jr., in a press release, are the result of “listening carefully to [Recording Academy] members to make sure our rules and guidelines reflect today's music.” The next Grammy Awards take place on Sunday, February 1, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That record is one of seven compiled on Tracks II: The Lost Albums, his new box set, which is out June 27. Twilight Hours is an orchestral album of “romantic, lost-in-the-city songs” inspired by the American pop standards, said Springsteen in press materials. “At one time it was either a double record [with Western Stars] or they were part of the same record,” he added. “I love Burt Bacharach and I love those kinds of songs and those kinds of songwriters. I took a swing at it because the chordal structures and everything are much more complicated, which was fun for me to pull off. All this stuff could have come right off of those '60s albums.” Players include the E Street Band's Max Weinberg, Patti Scialfa, and Soozie Tyrell, Kaveh Rastegar and Scott Tibbs, and producer Ron Aniello. Springsteen has now released a song from all but one of the shelved albums compiled on Tracks II. The one album that Springsteen has not previewed is LA Garage Sessions '83.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Comedian and children's author David Walliams has drawn widespread condemnation, including from the BBC, for making two Nazi salutes during a recording of panel show Would I Lie To You? The Times first reported that Walliams, also a former judge on Britain's Got Talent, made the gestures during a segment in which another panellist joked about injuring their wrist while waving. Jason Isaacs and Celia Imrie to Receive Raindance Film Festival Icon Award “Some other panellist was talking when David Walliams started doing the Nazi salute,” Topan told BBC News. But as discussions continued, Walliams is said to have done the salute again and added a sexual gesture with his other hand. The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Walliams' team for comment. A spokesperson for Banijay U.K., which owns the show's production company Zeppotron, said that any attempt at humor regarding this “deeply offensive gesture,” whether broadcast or not, is “completely unacceptable in any context.” “It was immediately acknowledged during the recording that this segment would not be broadcast under any circumstances,” they continued, “and we apologise to those who were at the recording for any offence caused.” It isn't the first time Walliams has come under fire for controversy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Beatle had cited Wilson's work on Pet Sounds as a key inspiration for his future writing and recording. Paul McCartney has paid tribute to the late Brian Wilson, 82, whose death was announced on Wednesday (June 11), calling his songs “achingly special” and that “I loved him.” Yesterday, news broke that the Beach Boys leader had died, but a cause and date of death has not yet been announced. Tributes have been shared by a number of musical greats who were inspired by Wilson's songwriting genius, including Bob Dylan, Elton John, Questlove and more. On his Instagram account on Thursday (June 12), McCartney wrote, “Brian had that mysterious sense of musical genius that made his songs so achingly special. He added, “I loved him, and was privileged to be around his bright shining light for a little while. How we will continue without Brian Wilson, ‘God Only Knows'. McCartney cited “God Only Knows” as one of “the best songs ever written” and in 2000, inducted Wilson into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Speaking during the ceremony, McCartney declared his admiration for Wilson's work. “In the '60s, particularly, he wrote some music that when I played it, it made me cry and I don't quite know why. It wasn't necessarily the words or the music, it's just something so deep in it, that there's only certain pieces of music that can do this to me… I think it's a sign of great genius to be able to do that with a bunch of music and a bunch of notes. And this man, he deserves to be in the Hall of Fame, that's for sure. He added, “So thank you, sir, for making me cry. Following the release of Pet Sounds, Wilson was increasingly impacted by mental health struggles and he was eventually diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.
