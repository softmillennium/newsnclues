                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The lawsuit, which was filed on Wednesday and originally reported on by Bloomberg, accuses Zhongjie “Jay” Li of stealing trade secrets regarding Tesla's development of “advanced robotic hand sensors” to launch his startup Proception, a Y Combinator-backed company building robotic hands. The complaint states that Li, who worked at Tesla from August 2022 to September 2024, downloaded confidential information about Optimus on two separate personal smartphones. The complaint also added that during the last few months of his time at Tesla, Li researched “humanoid robotic hands” on his workplace computer in addition to making internet searches regarding venture capital and other startup funding sources. “Less than a week after he left Tesla, Proception was incorporated,” the complaint stated. “And within just five months, Proception publicly claimed to have ‘successfully built' advanced humanoid robotic hands—-hands that bear a striking resemblance to the designs Li worked on at Tesla.” TechCrunch reached out to Proception and Tesla for more information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York-based micromobility startup Infinite Machine has revealed a seated scooter called Olto that will cost $3,495 when it starts shipping later this year. The Olto will feature 40 miles of range, pulled from an easily swappable 48V lithium-ion battery. Infinite Machine says the Olto will have a top speed of 20 miles per hour in bike lines and “33mph off-road,” powered by a 750W rear hub motor. Infinite Machine is also promising the Olto is modular, with the ability to attach or detach elements you might find on a larger cargo bike, like a child carrier, rear rack, or basket. It's a hefty price tag, but it's less than half of what Infinite Machine is charging for its flagship Cybertruck-style two-wheeler, the P1. That vehicle, which the startup has begun shipping to its first customers, costs $10,000. That churn has been difficult to navigate, especially in the United States. Founder and CEO Joseph Cohen told TechCrunch at the time that his goal for Infinite Machine was to ultimately have vehicles in every major city around the world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mel Brooks is really taking this Spaceballs thing seriously. In the original film, one of his characters, Yogurt, was a parody of Yoda, the Star Wars Jedi Master who lived to be almost 1,000. Well, now we know Brooks has been going all in on character preparation and, at the age of 99, will officially reprise Yogurt for the long-awaited sequel, set for release 40 years after the original. Here's a hilarious teaser making it all official. This time he'll just be acting, though, with Josh Greenbaum (Barb and Star Go To Vista Del Mar) directing from a script by Benji Samit, Dan Hernandez, and Josh Gad. Bill Pullman and Rick Moranis are also expected to return, along with newcomer Keke Palmer in a mystery role. The original film joked about a sequel, called Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money, which was not meant to happen. But, at that time, Star Wars was thought to be done for good. The Force is strong once again, and now, it's time for Spaceballs to return. Amazon says that it's “A Non-Prequel Non-Reboot Sequel Part Two but with Reboot Elements Franchise Expansion Film.” Not much of a help. But, the teaser also says “The Schwartz Awakens,” so you have to imagine Gad and crew will go with a take inspired by the sequel trilogy, peppering in classic characters like Lone Star (Pullman) and Dark Helmet (Moranis) with a larger focus on new characters (such as Palmer and Gad) who learn the power of the Schwartz. And, of course, we know Yogurt will return too. Are you confident that this can be the sequel we've always wanted? And does Brooks' addition make it feel more real in a way? Update June 12 1:50 p.m. – After we published this story, Deadline further reported that Rick Moranis and Bill Pullman may also return for the sequel, alongside Keke Palmer in a new role.

AMD unveiled its new MI350X and MI355X GPUs for AI workloads here at its Advancing AI 2025 event in San Jose, California, claiming the new accelerators offer a 3X performance boost over the prior-gen MI300X, positioning the company to improve its competitive footing against its market-leading rival, Nvidia. AMD claims it beats Nvidia in like-for-like inference benchmarks by up to 1.3X and leads by up to 1.13X in select training workloads. AMD also claims a 4X increase in "AI compute performance" compared to prior-generation AMD MI300X models and a 35X increase in inference performance, largely achieved by transitioning to the CDNA 4 architecture and utilizing a smaller, more advanced process node for the compute chiplets. AMD's production MI350 platforms began shipping last month. However, the MI350X is geared for air-cooled solutions with a lower Total Board Power (TBP), while the MI355X pushes power consumption up a notch for liquid-cooled systems geared for the highest performance possible. AMD will not release an APU version of this chip like it did with last generation's MI300A, which featured both CPU and GPU cores on a single die. In contrast, this generation will have GPU-only designs. AMD's MI355X comes with 1.6 times the HBM3E memory capacity of Nvidia's competing GB200 and B200 GPUs, but delivers the same 8TB/s of memory bandwidth. AMD claims a 2X advantage in peak FP64 / FP32 over Nvidia's chips, which isn't surprising given Nvidia's optimization focus on the more AI-friendly lower-precision formats. As we move down to lower-precision formats, such as FP16, FP8, and FP4, you can see that AMD generally matches or slightly exceeds the Nvidia comparables. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. As we've also seen with Nvidia's competing chips, the new design and heightened performance also come with increased power consumption, which tops out at a 1,400W Total Board Power (TBP) for the liquid-cooled high-performance MI355X model. AMD says this increase in performance density allows its customers to cram more performance into a single rack, thereby decreasing the all-important performance-per-TCO (total cost of ownership) metric, which quantifies performance-per-dollar at the rack level. The chip features eight total XCD chiplets, each with 32 compute units (CU) enabled, for a total of 256 CU (AMD has four CU in reserve per XCD to improve yield; these are disabled as needed). This reorganization enabled AMD to double the Infinity Fabric bus width, improving bi-sectional bandwidth to up to 5.5 TB/s, while also reducing power consumption by lowering the bus frequency and voltage. The chips communicate with one another via an all-to-all topology with eight accelerators per node communicating across 153.6 GB/s bi-directional Infinity Fabric links. Each node is powered by two of AMD's fifth-gen EPYC 'Turin' chips. AMD supports all forms of networking, but positions its new Pollara Ultra Ethernet Consortium-capable NICs (UEC) as an optimum scale-out solution, while the Ultra Accelerator Link (UAL) interconnect is employed for scale-up networking. AMD offers both Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) and Air Cooled (AC) racks. The AC solutions top out at 64 GPUs and 18TB of HBM3E, utilizing larger nodes to dissipate the thermal load via air cooling. AMD has tremendously increased its focus on unleashing the power of rack-scale architectures, a glaring deficiency relative to Nvidia. AMD has undertaken a series of acquisitions and developed a strong and expanding roster of partner OEMs to further its goals. As one would expect, AMD shared some of its performance projections and benchmarks against not only its own prior-gen systems, but also against Nvidia comparables. As always, take vendor-provided benchmarks with a grain of salt. We have included the test notes below for your perusal. AMD also says MI355X is also competitive with Nvidia's B200 and GB200 in training workloads, though here it highlights either parity or a slight 1.13X performance advantage in a range of LLama models. AMD says the MI355X provides up to 4.2X more performance over the MI300X in AI Agent and Chatbot workloads, along with strong gains ranging from 2.6X to 3.8X in content generation, summarization, and conversational AI work. We will update this article as AMD shares more details during its keynote, which is occurring now. Paul Alcorn is the Managing Editor: News and Emerging Tech for Tom's Hardware US.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The pro case for privatisation (that I happen to believe in) is: you were paying for it anyway, via your tax dollars, having it private leads to competition and stronger incentives to improve/cut costs meaning it will net cost you less. Selling what by law should be public data is anathema. It is not like this company is going to take over the management of weather balloons you have already paid for. Or I don't know how you imagine this is going to work.>  This is not privatization in the way that you seem to think it is.Can you tell me more about how you think it is? Do we pay taxes once and that's it? It does not need to turn a profit. Government services are not products for the generation of profit. About 30% of Americans get (NWS) weather data for free. They pay no income tax yet receive the same level of public benefits. On the other hand, a handful of Americans pay millions for weather data, and receive the same thing as those who paid nothing.For a private service though, it would just be $20/mo or whatever for everyone. On the matter of taxes being proportional to income, I'm not going to argue about progressive taxation or any moralistic standpoint of proportional taxation. From purely a utility standpoint, those handful of people probably reap way more value from that NWS data being available. Another even more direct use for the economy would be routing of trucks through snowy passes, or planning for large construction companies. Nothing else you said is wrong, I'm just saying that government services are effectively progressively priced based on income. Looking around, the exact number is quite hard to pin down because of the definition of it, but ~30% is probably a very fair estimate based on https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tpc-number-those-who-dont... It worked very well for pennies and benefitted the economy greatly. It's just inefficient.With 50 of our systems doing 4 profiles a day (which is no where close to max scale), you get the same volume of data for way less. And on top of that, because we reach remote and oceanic areas that aren't being measured today, the data is also more valuable!Also, the data you're referring to isn't inherently public domain. That's true whether they pay for the infrastructure themselves or buy the data directly from a company.

Arm CEO Rene Haas has joined Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in criticizing U.S. export controls of AI semiconductors to China, a move he says could slow the overall advance of the technology, impacting both consumers and industry players, as reported by Bloomberg. Speaking at the Founders Forum Global conference in Oxford, Haas said, "If you narrow access to technology and you force other ecosystems to grow up, it's not good... He also touched on Arm's footprint in China, noting the company's presence is "quite significant." Washington enacted curbs on the exports of data center processors to China in April, a measure that has reportedly cost Nvidia $8 billion and has largely shut it out of the market. In May, Huang branded Trump's export controls "a failure," and warned they were having the opposite effect on the market as intended. Rather than stifling China's growth in AI to give the U.S. an advantage, Huang postulated that the ban was pushing Chinese rivals, including Huawei, to accelerate growth and innovation in AI, ultimately leading to more competitive offerings. He lamented that due to the ban, which directly affects its H200 chip, Nvidia had had to write off the equivalent of a semiconductor company from its bottom line. Continuing his own lobbying efforts, Haas revealed he has spent "far more time in Washington in the last year and a half than I have in my entire career," but admitted that the current administrationt has "a lot of smart people who are who are connected to our industry," adding that he thought Arm's voice was being heard. This week at VivaTech in Paris, Huang warned that if AI chip restrictions continue, Huawei will take advantage, stating "our technology is a generation ahead of theirs," but warned that "If the United States doesn't want to partake, participate in China, Huawei has got China covered, and Huawei has got everybody else covered."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Smartphone startup Nothing will sell its next flagship model, the Nothing Phone (3), in the U.S. through its website and Amazon, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. Nothing, which will unveil the new phone early next month in London, has released eight phones since its inception in 2020, but only one, the Phone (2), has made it to general sale in the U.S. so far. “We have already seen strong conversion rates from users switching to Nothing, and with Phone (3), we are going after that opportunity in a much more focused way. Pei is banking on the fact that Nothing's focus on differentiating the design of its smartphones will attract people who are looking for alternatives to Apple, Samsung, and Google. And in Canada, Nothing is partnering with Best Buy to sell its new flagship, along with a new over-ear headphone model, Headphone (1), on retail channels for the first time. He added that while Pei's former company, OnePlus, also sells unlocked devices in the U.S., its shipment volumes are low. This means Nothing has an uphill climb ahead in the North American market. Nothing has so far raised more than $250 million over multiple rounds.

"Huawei has got China covered," shared Nvidia boss Jensen Huang when speaking with reporters at VivaTech in Paris this year. Huang warns of potential misplays that could hand a major win to China in the current AI race as the US turns to trade isolationism. China currently stands as the world's second-largest economy, with Huawei being its most notable tech firm. “Our technology is a generation ahead of theirs,” said Huang of Huawei, a claim that Huawei itself affirms internally. But this was followed with a warning: "If the United States doesn't want to partake, participate in China, Huawei has got China covered, and Huawei has got everybody else covered." Since 2020, the U.S. has entertained a policy of banning any large Chinese tech firms from access to advanced chipmaking technologies by placing them on the Department of Commerce's "Entity List", noting firms with ties to foreign security risks, and also by heavily restricting trade of U.S. leading-edge technology into China. However, the situation has escalated in recent weeks as President Trump has launched a more intense tariff offensive against China. "So long as all the AI developers are in China, you know, I think [the] China stack is going to win. And so we just have to be mindful of near-term actions on long-term, unintended consequences." A recent report found that China has doubled the U.S.'s research output on next-generation chip technologies over the last ten years, with a majority of the most-cited and highest-quality studies coming from China.

Huang was careful not to criticize or place blame on the Trump administration for recent policy changes that potentially give an edge to China. The president "knows what he's doing," says Jensen. While Huawei may be humble about its current capabilities, the firm is still nothing to sneeze at, as a leading bastion in various Chinese domestic chip initiatives. As China continues to bolster its domestic chip industry, time will tell if modern U.S. trade initiatives are doing more to help than hinder its progress.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With just over a month to go to the broadcast of its third season, Paramount has confirmed that Star Trek: Strange New Worlds will end with its fifth season. The newly-confirmed fifth season will run for six episodes, down from Strange New Worlds‘ typical 10-episode seasons. No expected release window for the final season was confirmed, however the show's fourth season, already announced back in April 2024, is currently in production. “From the very beginning, Strange New Worlds set out to honor what Star Trek has always stood for–boundless curiosity, hope and the belief that a better future is possible,” executive producers Akiva Goldsman, Henry Alonso Myers, and Alex Kurtzman said in a joint statement provided via press release. “We're deeply grateful to Paramount+ for the chance to complete our five-season mission, just as we envisioned it, alongside our extraordinary cast and crew. And to the passionate fans who've boldly joined us on this journey–THANK YOU. With three more spectacular seasons ahead for you to see and enjoy, this adventure is far from over.” Strange New Worlds‘ conclusion follows a trend set in Star Trek‘s streaming renaissance by Discovery and Lower Decks before it, which also both ran for five seasons. A new film exploring the foundational years of Starfleet is currently in the works from director Toby Haynes, while Patrick Stewart has openly discussed plans for a potential return to the role of Jean-Luc Picard in a new film, presumably set after the conclusion of Star Trek: Picard. Strange New Worlds returns for its third season on July 17, with a two-episode premiere.

The MIG Flash was unveiled last year, serving as a flash cart that allows Nintendo Switch owners to play game backups from a microSD card. It effectively cosplays as an official Nintendo Switch game cartridge, tricking the console into recognizing and running dumped ROMs stored on the microSD card. Though intended for legitimate owners to easily maintain personal game backups, or for aspiring game developers hoping to make games for the Switch 2, the MIG Flash has, one way or another, found its way into the hands of pirates as well. In a recent demo on X, they managed to boot The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, directly from the MIG Flash, though the load time was painfully slow. This was likely achieved through a firmware update, allowing it to circumvent new checks introduced by Nintendo for the Switch 2 that prevented it from booting or loading games previously. Still, don't expect it to run backups for Switch 2 games as dumping those ROMs is currently not possible, not to mention the illegality of such an act. There have been whispers of a userland exploit on the Switch 2, but its functionality and scope are extremely limited. While the MIG Flash can theoretically enable pirates to play titles from the original Switch on Switch 2 hardware, it carries a very high risk of getting your console banned. Nintendo has sophisticated systems in place to detect if multiple consoles share the same cartridge ID and flag this as piracy, leading to an account ban, a console ban, or, at worst, a bricked console.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daniel Sokolovsky, the co-founder and CEO of Warp, told TechCrunch that Warp is always looking for ways to make shipping more efficient for its customers, which include enterprises like Walmart, Gopuff, and HelloFresh. Warp started by installing cameras into its test warehouse in Los Angeles and used computer vision to turn that data into a virtual warehouse to start experimenting. “We effectively made a digital twin, or simulation environment for our LA facility,” Sokolovsky said. Honestly, a lot of it was, what happens if we do this? Then Warp started to find success using off-the-self robots with some additional tech retrofitted on. “We are now using, whether it's AI in the form of voice, text, email, phone calls or robotics, [to make sure] that we're unloading, storing, and reloading freight. We actually think that we can actually continue this on, and really get to our goals as quickly as possible, without hiring more people.” Troy Lester, Warp co-founder and CRO, said that these robots will help give Warp's underlying warehouse partners — other than its Los Angeles test facility, the company doesn't outright own the warehouses in its network — an edge, also helping to reduce labor costs. “They're complaining to us about staffing issues all the time,” Lester said. So I think there is an opportunity to kind of empower those businesses to have these robotic kits that would not only help make our network better, but help make their business with other companies better as well.” Warp is testing several different versions of the robots and ambitiously claims it will start deploying this year. Sokolovsky said Warp's Los Angeles test facility is totally autonomous, and the company plans to start deploying these robots to warehouses in its core networks — Los Angeles, Chicago, New Jersey, Dallas, and Miami — first. Warp doesn't plan on selling the tech outside of its hub — at least for now — because it gives Warp, and its underlying warehouse partners, a competitive advantage. “Instead of going out and saying, hey, we're just a robot company, AI company, and spend money on like this potential concept, it's like, no, we're actually a logistics company that has been really impacting and servicing our customers,” Sokolovsky said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Wednesday, acting FAA administrator Chris Rocheleau told the House Appropriations Committee that the Federal Aviation Administration plans to replace its aging air traffic control systems, which still rely on floppy disks and Windows 95 computers, Tom's Hardware reports. No more floppy disks or paper strips,” Rocheleau said during the committee hearing. US transportation secretary Sean Duffy called the project “the most important infrastructure project that we've had in this country for decades,” describing it as a bipartisan priority. Most air traffic control towers and facilities across the US currently operate with technology that seems frozen in the 20th century, although that isn't necessarily a bad thing—when it works. Some controllers currently use paper strips to track aircraft movements and transfer data between systems using floppy disks, while their computers run Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system, which launched in 1995. As Tom's Hardware notes, modernization of the system is broadly popular. Sheldon Jacobson, a University of Illinois professor who has studied risks in aviation, says that the system works remarkably well as is but that an upgrade is still critical, according to NPR. While the vintage systems may have inadvertently protected air traffic control from widespread outages like the CrowdStrike incident that disrupted modern computer systems globally in 2024, agency officials say 51 of the FAA's 138 systems are unsustainable due to outdated functionality and a lack of spare parts. The FAA isn't alone in clinging to floppy disk technology. San Francisco's train control system still runs on DOS loaded from 5.25-inch floppy disks, with upgrades not expected until 2030 due to budget constraints. Japan has also struggled in recent years to modernize government record systems that use floppy disks. Modernizing the air traffic control system presents engineering challenges that extend far beyond simply installing newer computers. Unlike typical IT upgrades, ATC systems must maintain continuous 24/7 operation, because shutting down facilities for maintenance could compromise aviation safety. This uptime requirement eliminates the possibility of traditional system replacement approaches where old hardware gets swapped out during scheduled downtime. The replacement systems must also meet security requirements to resist cyberattacks. A successful breach of air traffic control infrastructure could paralyze national aviation networks, resulting in cascading effects that impact transportation, commerce, and emergency services. In an NPR report on the issue, aviation industry analyst Robert W. Mann Jr. expressed skepticism about whether new systems will actually materialize. Still, recent failures have confirmed some vulnerabilities in the aging system. Experts blamed the failure on aging infrastructure and damaged database files, with sources telling CNN at the time that budget constraints had repeatedly delayed needed tech refreshes. More recently, radar and communication outages led to hundreds of delays and cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport, with a wiring failure being cited as one cause. The FAA has announced several “Industry Days” where companies can present their technologies and proposals to department officials.

The surviving patches are small: 10's of meters on a side. The title language and figures cited make it appear this was a large scale farm operation. It's not Florida, but it's also not exactly the Arctic either: the growing season is months shorter, but it does exist, there is ample precipitation, and the soil is often excellent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They expanded aggressively, took risks, and created entirely new markets. So why is AI being treated differently?One reason seems to be risk aversion. They could afford to hire more people, putting more creative minds to work, while AI acts as an accelerator — automating repetitive tasks, generating prototypes, coordinating agents, and simulating large-scale systems. This opens the door to projects that previously seemed too complex or costly: personalized education platforms, open-ended scientific research, AI-driven drug discovery, sustainable agriculture systems, or highly efficient digital public services.Yes, these kinds of projects are risky. But they also offer disproportionate rewards, both financially and socially. Companies that bet on bold, transformative uses of AI — instead of simply optimizing existing processes — are the ones that will shape the future, just as Google did with search or SpaceX with aerospace.Ironically, AI can also reduce the cost of failure. It allows for faster prototyping, quicker insights, and tighter feedback loops. This makes bold experimentation more feasible than ever.The real obstacle is not the technology, but a lack of vision and courage. Companies that adopt a more ambitious mindset, and treat AI as a collaborator rather than a replacement, have the chance to redefine what is possible.So the question shouldn't be, "How many people can we replace with AI?" It should be, "What are the things we've never dared to try that AI now makes achievable?"

Now after decade(s), some of these persons are in a management position dealing with "AI". Having machines do the goods and services production while humans are free to pursue whatever they wish (with a basic income of-course) IS world changing. Some of the more risk tolerant people might do it for their sliver of equity, but many will not.For example, one of my jobs (I am overemployed) is as a dev for a small startup that first tried to outsource development and then had to hire devs in house as that was a disaster. Customers are bailing as we cannot meet our commitments.I would argue rational management would push hard to fix things quickly and spend the money to do so even if it meant raising money sooner, as key customers are fleeing, our reputation is mediocre, and stability is nowhere close. As an employee, I am fighting hard for a controlled flight into the ground to drag out how long the paychecks for this mess keep flowing.Why?As an employee, I have no meaningful upside unless my options suddenly get valuable and I long ago learned that you can be laid off with limited recourse, so I value equity at zero. Better to take the certain win as if you are an employee, it isn't as though you definitely gain from the company gaining.

I will take the 100% certain death of my employer over 3 years rather than a 50/50 chance of success as a business.Same thing with managers and AI.
