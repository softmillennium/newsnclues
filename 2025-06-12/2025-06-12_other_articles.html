                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new theory being widely shared on social media is that President Donald Trump may be wearing a "hidden" leg brace. The unsubstantiated claims took hold after the president, who will turn 79 on Saturday, stumbled while boarding Air Force One last weekend. Images have since circulated on various online platforms of Trump inspecting work in the Rose Garden on Monday, which appeared to show "bulges" in his trousers, possibly indicating the presence of leg braces. In one, it was suggested that Trump's decision to create a Mar-a-Lago-style patio in the famous White House Rose Garden was because he has trouble walking on thick grass and would be steadier on pavement. This is hardly the first time that a slip on the stairs of Air Force One or an ill-fitting suit has been seen as being at least somewhat "newsworthy." In the social media era, such matters can't go unnoticed. Trump often joined, if he hadn't already led, the efforts to call out any misstep by former President Joe Biden, when images and videos circulated of Biden slipping or tripping while boarding Air Force One. An irony for Mr. Biden is that he may have inadvertently caused some of the issues. Just weeks after winning the 2020 election, Biden suffered a hairline fracture on his foot while playing with one of his dogs. The inconsistency in wearing the boot may have contributed to his persistent stiff gait, which became increasingly noticeable during his presidency. It was in the pre-social media days, but some claims still went "viral" in 2004 that former President George W. Bush had worn a radio receiver connected to an earpiece that fed him answers during a debate with then-Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. The only "evidence" was a bulge in Bush's jacket. If social media had been around, it likely would have received even more scrutiny. Similar allegations were leveled against former Vice President Kamala Harris during last September's debate with Trump, with some users claiming she wore a pair of Nova H1 Audio earphones disguised as pearl earrings. It hasn't just been fashion-related issues that now trend on social media, either. In 2016, rumors also circulated that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was replaced by a body double to conceal serious health issues. It came after Clinton was forced to leave a 9/11 memorial event early after feeling overheated and was diagnosed with pneumonia. It wasn't the only, or even the most high-profile, rumor that dogged Clinton, but it certainly didn't help her campaign. There have also been allegations that the mainstream media didn't dig deep enough into Biden's stumbles, including a fall on stage during the June 2023 U.S. Air Force Academy graduation ceremony. Critics of Mr. Biden argue that it wasn't just White House insiders who concealed his decline, but that the media also failed to do their job, a failure that now seems far more apparent. It wasn't until the presidential debate between Biden and Trump last June that the issue became too difficult to ignore. Still, questions about Biden's fitness had already been regularly raised on social media. It didn't become widely known that he was confined to a wheelchair until after his death. Such matters weren't considered newsworthy at the time. Likewise, the public didn't know of his or most presidents' extramarital affairs. The media simply didn't focus on such things. That changed over time, and the world likely knew too many details about former President Bill Clinton's activities in the Oval Office. In the social media era, such rumors can circulate, even if they're not true. Failing that, there is always the "WhatAboutism" argument to fall back on. If Trump slips on the stairs of Air Force One, as soon as a video appears on X, ten more will follow, showing Biden looking worse, and possibly a few vintage ones of Gerald R. Ford slipping on Air Force One's stairs will circulate for good measure. And as for the leg brace, it may go viral, but it will only be believed by those critical of the sitting president. The divide is simply too great, but that's what social media does best.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Syfy's new supernatural horror series, Revival, debuts Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Adapted from the Image Comics series of the same name created by Tim Seeley and Mike Norton, Syfy's Revival TV series is created by Aaron B. Koontz and Luke Boyce. Revival stars Melanie Scrofano, Romy Weltman, David James Elliott, and Andy McQueen, with Steven Ogg, Gia Sandhu, Karherine King, and WWE superstar CM Punk in recurring roles. Revival season 1 will consist of 10 episodes, and the critics who have reviewed the series have been generally favorable, especially about series lead Melanie Scrofano, who plays police officer Dana Cypress. Revival joins other popular recent hits on Syfy like Resident Alien and Chucky. Critics on Rotten Tomatoes hail Revival as "a spiritual successor" to Melanie Scrofano's prior series, Wynonna Earp, and praise Scrofano and the cast for elevating the series from its comic book roots. Revival also drew favor for "not taking itself too seriously" compared to other supernatural zombie series. Scrofano is also known for her recurring role in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds as Captain Marie Batel. One of Scrofano's Revival co-stars, Gia Sandhu, also plays T'Pring, the Vulcan fiancée of Spock (Ethan Peck), on Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. CM Punk, who also appeared in Netflix's wrestling drama Heels, brings his own fanbase, and Steven Ogg is a popular familiar face for his various roles in TV series like Snowpiercer and video games like Grand Theft Auto. Along with Revival, Scrofano returns as Captain Batel in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3. The back end of Revival's 10-episode season 1 will coincide with the first few weeks of Strange New Worlds season 3, which premieres on July 17 on Paramount+. If Revival proves to be a hit that lasts a few seasons on Syfy, it takes some of the sting out of the announcement that Star Trek: Strange New Worlds is ending with season 5. Scrofano has amassed a solid and loyal fan base that has followed her since Wynonna Earp and its follow-up, Wynonna Earp: Vengeance. Revivial's strong start and Fresh Rotten Tomatoes score should help jumpstart it to become another mainstay for Syfy. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. An update surrounding Wheel of Time's season 4 confirms that despite waiting 31 years for the adaptation, viewers will have to face one harsh reality. There have been many great fantasy TV shows that pushed the genre forward, but these series are considered benchmarks for all other fantasy shows. Silo is ending with season 4 is perfect because it seems to ensure that the next two seasons of the series will avoid repeating one season 2 mistake.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For nearly a decade, Donald Trump has tried to reject the legitimacy of those who protest against him, falsely accusing them of being “paid protesters.” It's a pitch rooted in an ugly assumption: Americans who disagree with the president can only be explained by corrupt schemes and illicit payments. As aggressive tactics from Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents spark a public backlash, the president has leaned into the “paid protesters” line with increased vigor and enthusiasm. Trump pushed the line during his remarks to U.S. troops at Fort Bragg this week — he claimed that an unnamed, nefarious person is secretly “financing” the protests in Los Angeles, for example — and echoed the evidence-free claim to reporters at Andrews Air Force base soon after. When a reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt who, exactly, the president believes is paying the protesters, instead of answering the question, she claimed that Trump has “a lot of common sense” — despite the fact that his conspiracy theory is neither common nor sensible. But even more interesting were the comments from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard during her recent Fox News appearance. Who is funding these protestors?” the DNI asked rhetorically. For now, let's not dwell on the fact that it's not at all “obvious” that a secret rascal is putting up enormous amounts of money to pay people to protest against the president and his agenda. Just because the DNI claimed that Trump's conspiracy theory is generating Justice Department and FBI scrutiny doesn't mean that it's actually happening. Gabbard says all sorts of things that have little bearing on reality, so it's best not to make any assumptions. But if she's correct, it's unsettling to think federal law enforcement resources have been diverted in such a ridiculous way. The New York Times reported this week that top officials at the DOJ and the FBI are scrambling to keep up with Trump priorities that are “rooted in misinformation and conspiracy theories.” The article added that Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino are now “running what amounts to a conspiracy theory fulfillment center with unstocked shelves, critics say.”</p>

It's up to the public to pressure our representatives into a position where NOT supporting bills like the UAPDA would make them OVERWHELMINGLY unpopular to either the general populace or at least people powerful enough to impact their position. Let's try and focus on this and figure out how to unlock the truths we already know. I TOTALLY get the enthusiasm on this sub to try and squeeze blood from a stone while we sit in the dark and search for answers, but we shouldn't lose sight of what is REAL and verifiable and compelling and actionable amidst all of the claims, the rumors, and the theories that those of us on this sub or who follow the topic are inundated with.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This prevalence suggests that belief in the paranormal is a “feature, not a bug, of the human animal,” journalist Matt Hongoltz-Hetling writes in his new book, The Ghost Lab: How Bigfoot Hunters, Mediums, and Alien Enthusiasts Are Wrecking Science. Despite the forceful title, Hongoltz-Hetling's book isn't a screed against Sasquatch stans or explorers of the spirit realm. With intellectual humility, he tells the story of New Hampshire's Kitt Research Initiative, a ragtag bunch of paranormal investigators who attempt to scientifically and skeptically scrutinize paranormal entities, from curses to cryptids. Ghost Lab is like a season of your favorite spooky, ghost-hunting television show, in which you grow to know and like the hunters, and maybe even understand what drives them. Hongoltz-Hetling pairs this absorbing narrative with an exploration of institutional distrust. Why do so many Americans no longer trust such social pillars as religion, government, healthcare, education, and the media? Big Think got in touch with Hongoltz-Hetling for a spoiler-free discussion about his book, paranormal belief, and the broader issue of institutional distrust. (The following interview has been edited for length and clarity) Big Think: Why do so many people in New Hampshire see ghosts, aliens, and cryptids? Hongoltz-Hetling: New Hampshire has a perfect storm of dynamics within its culture. First, New England is much more infused with a sense of history and age than other parts of the country; it was settled first, and there's a constant homage to the past. It has its “Live free or die” motto. Those factors have also made New Hampshire the leader in institutional distrust. So all of those things together are a perfect recipe for breeding increased belief in supernatural phenomena. Showcasing this, New Hampshire has had some truly seminal moments in paranormal history. I think [that incident] seeded the local and regional communities with a higher awareness of those sorts of things. Instead of just reading about it through an AP story or seeing it talked about on The Tonight Show, you may know somebody who is connected to this big UFO incident. For all those reasons New Hampshire is in the perfect place at the perfect time to inherit an increased awareness of, and belief in, those “out there” phenomena. Big Think: What inspired you to spend so much time with and to write about a team of paranormal investigators? Yet, I've had more of a skeptical mindset for my adult life. When I'm asked now if I believe in ghosts, I often say “occasionally and fleetingly.” I walk around every day not believing, but then I hear something weird in the night and glimpse a shadow out of the corner of my eye, and my first thought is not an intruder. We believe in science despite our human nature, not because of it. Big Think: Let's get into these paranormal investigators that you followed, because they are really the stars of your book and made it a fascinating, fun read. What was it like spending time with them? I considered a bunch of entry points into that story. What appealed to me about Andy [Kitt] was that he had become a big player in one paranormal group but left it to start another. That suggested conflict and differing points of view, and I was looking for those diversities of opinion within the ghost-hunting community. What is it about one group's beliefs that can be so controversial that one of their primary members left for another group? That keyed me into Andy, who is an unusual guy. He prides himself on being offensive and associates it with being a straight-shooter — he “calls it like he sees it.” Andy was not particularly interested in the paranormal until the death of his father. Then a series of compelling personal experiences caused him to take up this idea of exploring paranormal phenomena with a scientific mindset. So he founded the Kitt Research Initiative (KRI) and assembled an “Avengers” team of paranormal enthusiasts. He had a Bigfoot hunter who also happened to be an alien abductee. He also had an empath who could feel the emotions of others, whether human or incorporeal entities. Big Think: How did you feel about believers in the paranormal before hanging out with Andy and his crew, and how did you feel afterward? Hongoltz-Hetling: My core beliefs remain the same: I walked into it skeptical of these phenomena, and I walked away skeptical. I thought they were nutty and bizarre, maybe even outright frauds. These people had personal experiences that have been very compelling to them. Big Think: Your book delved deep into the psychology of paranormal belief. For example, you noted how widespread these beliefs are, calling them a “feature, not a bug, of the human animal.” Why do you think paranormal beliefs are so ingrained? Hongoltz-Hetling: Our capacity to reason gives us the ability to understand and believe in scientific explanations for the universe's existence, but it's not what we're bred to believe. We believe in science despite our human nature, not because of it. They almost always come with a story, and we all know the human affinity for stories. We hear gobbledegook white noise, and our mind searches for the words. It's satisfying when our mind believes it has made sense of a little bit of that white noise. Big Think: What draws you to write about paranormal believers? The collective institutions that have dominated our lives for the last 80 years or so are losing public support. I want to understand what makes that tick. I like to do that by looking at the people who are outside the system and understanding them a little better — understanding why their beliefs and lifestyles are incompatible with more mainstream thinking. People are allowed to have wacky beliefs. We have to find more tolerance for benign or neutral beliefs so we can leverage that to stomp out the parts of these belief systems that are truly harmful. Big Think: Why do you think a distrust in institutions helps breed a belief in the paranormal and vice versa? You're all pretty sure that your experiences are the real thing, and there are enough of you to create a protective and reinforcing bubble of belief. Then you look to the authorities, and they're not saying anything about this stuff. If they are, it's a fairly nasty and dismissive debunking. You may think, “If everyone in my community has these experiences, why has science not documented them?” You can only conclude that either science has an enormous blindspot [for something] a majority of Americans have experienced — these paranormal phenomena — or that scientists see the evidence but are hiding it. Once you're gatewayed into that mindset, then you become a prime target for conspiracy theories across the spectrum. Big Think: Can institutions gain trust back? Hongoltz-Hetling: I feel like I've been obsessed with talking about my recommendations for institutions, in part because they are probably unpalatable to your average science-minded person. As a matter of practicality, we have to recognize that when scientists debunk and deride spiritual beliefs for fear of legitimizing them, what's actually happening is they're kicking tons of people out of the tent, and science itself is becoming delegitimized. Institutions have to hold space and free pathways that allow for an expression of these beliefs and turn our 80,000 working psychic mediums, 6,000 or more ghost-hunting groups, and one million alien abductees into stakeholders. We need to have protocols in our medical profession that can deal with these things as a metaphor for underlying evidence-driven explanations for what's going on. There's an example of this in the Muslim world. A lot of clinicians will treat what's described as Jinn possession, where a person says they've been possessed by an evil entity. The medical professional has access to a holy man who can come in and perform an exorcism of that Jinn. Embedded within that ritual are evidence-based treatments. People are allowed to have wacky beliefs. We have to find more tolerance for benign or neutral beliefs so we can leverage that to stomp out the parts of these belief systems that are truly harmful. Hongoltz-Hetling: We know that people are more likely to believe in supernatural things when they feel like they don't have control of a situation. If our institutions can communicate their work better, supernatural beliefs will dry up a bit. Are institutions on a path to do that? But there are pathways that institutions can take. Big Think: Can the rift between paranormal believers and their skeptics ever be closed? Hongoltz-Hetling: I do think there's a path. The Kitt Research Initiative had this idea that they would do true scientific explanations of the paranormal, and their honest effort was appealing to both believers and skeptics. If there were more people who understood both worldviews, it becomes quite easy to hold them both in your head.</p>
